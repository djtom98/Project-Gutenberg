Who hold Zam-Zammah, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfire-breathing dragon\xe2\x80\x9d, hold the Punjab, for the great green-bronze\r\npiece is always first of the conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s loot.\r\n\r\nThere was some justification for Kim\xe2\x80\x94he had kicked Lala Dinanath\xe2\x80\x99s boy\r\noff the trunnions\xe2\x80\x94since the English held the Punjab and Kim was\r\nEnglish. Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the\r\nvernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain\r\nsing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the\r\nsmall boys of the bazar; Kim was white\xe2\x80\x94a poor white of the very\r\npoorest. The half-caste woman who looked after him (she smoked opium,\r\nand pretended to keep a second-hand furniture shop by the square where\r\nthe cheap cabs wait) told the missionaries that she was Kim\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister; but his mother had been nursemaid in a Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s family and had\r\nmarried Kimball O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, a young colour-sergeant of the Mavericks, an\r\nIrish regiment. He afterwards took a post on the Sind, Punjab, and\r\nDelhi Railway, and his Regiment went home without him. The wife died of\r\ncholera in Ferozepore, and O\xe2\x80\x99Hara fell to drink and loafing up and down\r\nthe line with the keen-eyed three-year-old baby. Societies and\r\nchaplains, anxious for the child, tried to catch him, but O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\r\ndrifted away, till he came across the woman who took opium and learned\r\nthe taste from her, and died as poor whites die in India. His estate at\r\ndeath consisted of three papers\xe2\x80\x94one he called his \xe2\x80\x9c_ne varietur_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbecause those words were written below his signature thereon, and\r\nanother his \xe2\x80\x9cclearance-certificate\xe2\x80\x9d. The third was Kim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbirth-certificate. Those things, he was used to say, in his glorious\r\nopium-hours, would yet make little Kimball a man. On no account was Kim\r\nto part with them, for they belonged to a great piece of magic\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nmagic as men practised over yonder behind the Museum, in the big\r\nblue-and-white Jadoo-Gher\xe2\x80\x94the Magic House, as we name the Masonic\r\nLodge. It would, he said, all come right some day, and Kim\xe2\x80\x99s horn would\r\nbe exalted between pillars\xe2\x80\x94monstrous pillars\xe2\x80\x94of beauty and strength.\r\nThe Colonel himself, riding on a horse, at the head of the finest\r\nRegiment in the world, would attend to Kim\xe2\x80\x94little Kim that should have\r\nbeen better off than his father. Nine hundred first-class devils, whose\r\nGod was a Red Bull on a green field, would attend to Kim, if they had\r\nnot forgotten O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x94poor O\xe2\x80\x99Hara that was gang-foreman on the\r\nFerozepore line. Then he would weep bitterly in the broken rush chair\r\non the veranda. So it came about after his death that the woman sewed\r\nparchment, paper, and birth-certificate into a leather amulet-case\r\nwhich she strung round Kim\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd some day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, confusedly remembering O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s prophecies,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere will come for you a great Red Bull on a green field, and the\r\nColonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and\xe2\x80\x9d dropping into English\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnine\r\nhundred devils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall remember. A Red Bull and a Colonel on a horse\r\nwill come, but first, my father said, will come the two men making\r\nready the ground for these matters. That is how my father said they\r\nalways did; and it is always so when men work magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with those papers,\r\nhe would, of course, have been taken over by the Provincial Lodge, and\r\nsent to the Masonic Orphanage in the Hills; but what she had heard of\r\nmagic she distrusted. Kim, too, held views of his own. As he reached\r\nthe years of indiscretion, he learned to avoid missionaries and white\r\nmen of serious aspect who asked who he was, and what he did. For Kim\r\ndid nothing with an immense success. True, he knew the wonderful walled\r\ncity of Lahore from the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort Ditch; was hand in\r\nglove with men who led lives stranger than anything Haroun al Raschid\r\ndreamed of; and he lived in a life wild as that of the Arabian Nights,\r\nbut missionaries and secretaries of charitable societies could not see\r\nthe beauty of it. His nickname through the wards was \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Friend of\r\nall the World\xe2\x80\x9d; and very often, being lithe and inconspicuous, he\r\nexecuted commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and\r\nshiny young men of fashion. It was intrigue,\xe2\x80\x94of course he knew that\r\nmuch, as he had known all evil since he could speak,\xe2\x80\x94but what he loved\r\nwas the game for its own sake\xe2\x80\x94the stealthy prowl through the dark\r\ngullies and lanes, the crawl up a waterpipe, the sights and sounds of\r\nthe women\xe2\x80\x99s world on the flat roofs, and the headlong flight from\r\nhousetop to housetop under cover of the hot dark. Then there were holy\r\nmen, ash-smeared _faquirs_ by their brick shrines under the trees at\r\nthe riverside, with whom he was quite familiar\xe2\x80\x94greeting them as they\r\nreturned from begging-tours, and, when no one was by, eating from the\r\nsame dish. The woman who looked after him insisted with tears that he\r\nshould wear European clothes\xe2\x80\x94trousers, a shirt and a battered hat. Kim\r\nfound it easier to slip into Hindu or Mohammedan garb when engaged on\r\ncertain businesses. One of the young men of fashion\xe2\x80\x94he who was found\r\ndead at the bottom of a well on the night of the earthquake\xe2\x80\x94had once\r\ngiven him a complete suit of Hindu kit, the costume of a lowcaste\r\nstreet boy, and Kim stored it in a secret place under some baulks in\r\nNila Ram\xe2\x80\x99s timber-yard, beyond the Punjab High Court, where the\r\nfragrant deodar logs lie seasoning after they have driven down the\r\nRavi. When there was business or frolic afoot, Kim would use his\r\nproperties, returning at dawn to the veranda, all tired out from\r\nshouting at the heels of a marriage procession, or yelling at a Hindu\r\nfestival. Sometimes there was food in the house, more often there was\r\nnot, and then Kim went out again to eat with his native friends.\r\n\r\nAs he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now and again from\r\nhis king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the\r\nsweetmeat-seller\xe2\x80\x99s son, to make a rude remark to the native policeman\r\non guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned\r\ntolerantly: he knew Kim of old. So did the water-carrier, sluicing\r\nwater on the dry road from his goat-skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the\r\nMuseum carpenter, bent over new packing-cases. So did everybody in\r\nsight except the peasants from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder\r\nHouse to view the things that men made in their own province and\r\nelsewhere. The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures, and\r\nanybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff! Off! Let me up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Abdullah, climbing up Zam-Zammah\xe2\x80\x99s wheel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy father was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the _ghi_,\xe2\x80\x9d sang Kim.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet _me_ up!\xe2\x80\x9d shrilled little Chota Lal in his gilt-embroidered cap.\r\nHis father was worth perhaps half a million sterling, but India is the\r\nonly democratic land in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too. The Mussalmans pushed them off.\r\nThy father was a pastry-cook\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee\r\nBazar, such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never\r\nseen. He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy\r\nstuff like horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to\r\nany known trade or profession. At his belt hung a long open-work iron\r\npencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear. On his head was a\r\ngigantic sort of tam-o\xe2\x80\x99-shanter. His face was yellow and wrinkled, like\r\nthat of Fook Shing, the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar. His eyes turned\r\nup at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim to his companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abdullah, finger in mouth, staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Kim; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he is no man of India that _I_ have\r\never seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA priest, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chota Lal, spying the rosary. \xe2\x80\x9cSee! He goes\r\ninto the Wonder House!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the policeman, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand\r\nyour talk.\xe2\x80\x9d The constable spoke Punjabi. \xe2\x80\x9cO Friend of all the World,\r\nwhat does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend him hither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah, flourishing his\r\nbare heels. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a foreigner, and thou art a buffalo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys. He was old, and\r\nhis woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the\r\nmountain passes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Children, what is that big house?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in very fair Urdu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ajaib-Gher, the Wonder House!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim gave him no title\xe2\x80\x94such as Lala\r\nor Mian. He could not divine the man\xe2\x80\x99s creed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! The Wonder House! Can any enter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is written above the door\xe2\x80\x94all can enter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout payment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go in and out. _I_ am no banker,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! I am an old man. I did not know.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, fingering his rosary, he\r\nhalf turned to the Museum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your caste? Where is your house? Have you come far?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came by Kulu\xe2\x80\x94from beyond the Kailas\xe2\x80\x94but what know you? From the\r\nHills where\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he sighed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe air and water are fresh and cool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! Khitai [a Chinaman],\xe2\x80\x9d said Abdullah proudly. Fook Shing had once\r\nchased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss above the boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPahari [a hillman],\xe2\x80\x9d said little Chota Lal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, child\xe2\x80\x94a hillman from hills thou\xe2\x80\x99lt never see. Didst hear of\r\nBhotiyal [Tibet]? I am no Khitai, but a Bhotiya [Tibetan], since you\r\nmust know\xe2\x80\x94a lama\xe2\x80\x94or, say, a _guru_ in your tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _guru_ from Tibet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen such a man. They be\r\nHindus in Tibet, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe be followers of the Middle Way, living in peace in our lamasseries,\r\nand I go to see the Four Holy Places before I die. Now do you, who are\r\nchildren, know as much as I do who am old.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled benignantly on\r\nthe boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou eaten?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn, wooden begging-bowl. The\r\nboys nodded. All priests of their acquaintance begged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to eat yet.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned his head like an old tortoise in\r\nthe sunlight. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it true that there are many images in the Wonder\r\nHouse of Lahore?\xe2\x80\x9d He repeated the last words as one making sure of an\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abdullah. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is full of heathen _b\xc5\xabts_. Thou also\r\nart an idolater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind _him_,\xe2\x80\x9d said. Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s house and\r\nthere is no idolatry in it, but only a Sahib with a white beard. Come\r\nwith me and I will show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange priests eat boys,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Chota Lal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he is a stranger and a _b\xc5\xabt-parast_ (idolater),\xe2\x80\x9d said Abdullah,\r\nthe Mohammedan.\r\n\r\nKim laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is new. Run to your mothers\xe2\x80\x99 laps, and be safe. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim clicked round the self-registering turnstile; the old man followed\r\nand halted amazed. In the entrance-hall stood the larger figures of the\r\nGreco-Buddhist sculptures done, savants know how long since, by\r\nforgotten workmen whose hands were feeling, and not unskilfully, for\r\nthe mysteriously transmitted Grecian touch. There were hundreds of\r\npieces, friezes of figures in relief, fragments of statues and slabs\r\ncrowded with figures that had encrusted the brick walls of the Buddhist\r\n_stupas_ and _viharas_ of the North Country and now, dug up and\r\nlabelled, made the pride of the Museum. In open-mouthed wonder the lama\r\nturned to this and that, and finally checked in rapt attention before a\r\nlarge alto-relief representing a coronation or apotheosis of the Lord\r\nBuddha. The Master was represented seated on a lotus the petals of\r\nwhich were so deeply undercut as to show almost detached. Round Him was\r\nan adoring hierarchy of kings, elders, and old-time Buddhas. Below were\r\nlotus-covered waters with fishes and water-birds. Two butterfly-winged\r\ndevas held a wreath over His head; above them another pair supported an\r\numbrella surmounted by the jewelled headdress of the Bodhisat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord! The Lord! It is Sakya Muni himself,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama half sobbed;\r\nand under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist invocation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Him the Way,\xe2\x80\x94the Law,\xe2\x80\x94Apart\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWhom Maya held beneath her heart,\r\nAnanda\xe2\x80\x99s Lord\xe2\x80\x94the Bodhisat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd He is here! The Most Excellent Law is here also. My pilgrimage is\r\nwell begun. And what work! What work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder is the Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, and dodged sideways among the cases of\r\nthe arts and manufacturers wing. A white-bearded Englishman was looking\r\nat the lama, who gravely turned and saluted him and after some fumbling\r\ndrew forth a note-book and a scrap of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is my name,\xe2\x80\x9d smiling at the clumsy, childish print.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of us who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Places\xe2\x80\x94he is now Abbot\r\nof the Lung-Cho Monastery\xe2\x80\x94gave it me,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cHe spoke of\r\nthese.\xe2\x80\x9d His lean hand moved tremulously round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, then, O lama from Tibet. Here be the images, and I am\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he glanced at the lama\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto gather knowledge. Come to my\r\noffice awhile.\xe2\x80\x9d The old man was trembling with excitement.\r\n\r\nThe office was but a little wooden cubicle partitioned off from the\r\nsculpture-lined gallery. Kim laid himself down, his ear against a crack\r\nin the heat-split cedar door, and, following his instinct, stretched\r\nout to listen and watch.\r\n\r\nMost of the talk was altogether above his head. The lama, haltingly at\r\nfirst, spoke to the Curator of his own lamassery, the Such-zen,\r\nopposite the Painted Rocks, four months\xe2\x80\x99 march away. The Curator\r\nbrought out a huge book of photos and showed him that very place,\r\nperched on its crag, overlooking the gigantic valley of many-hued\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d The lama mounted a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles of Chinese\r\nwork. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the little door through which we bring wood before\r\nwinter. And thou\xe2\x80\x94the English know of these things? He who is now Abbot\r\nof Lung-Cho told me, but I did not believe. The Lord\xe2\x80\x94the Excellent\r\nOne\xe2\x80\x94He has honour here too? And His life is known?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all carven upon the stones. Come and see, if thou art rested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut shuffled the lama to the main hall, and, the Curator beside him,\r\nwent through the collection with the reverence of a devotee and the\r\nappreciative instinct of a craftsman.\r\n\r\nIncident by incident in the beautiful story he identified on the\r\nblurred stone, puzzled here and there by the unfamiliar Greek\r\nconvention, but delighted as a child at each new trove. Where the\r\nsequence failed, as in the Annunciation, the Curator supplied it from\r\nhis mound of books\xe2\x80\x94French and German, with photographs and\r\nreproductions.\r\n\r\nHere was the devout Asita, the pendant of Simeon in the Christian\r\nstory, holding the Holy Child on his knee while mother and father\r\nlistened; and here were incidents in the legend of the cousin\r\nDevadatta. Here was the wicked woman who accused the Master of\r\nimpurity, all confounded; here was the teaching in the Deer-park; the\r\nmiracle that stunned the fire-worshippers; here was the Bodhisat in\r\nroyal state as a prince; the miraculous birth; the death at Kusinagara,\r\nwhere the weak disciple fainted; while there were almost countless\r\nrepetitions of the meditation under the Bodhi tree; and the adoration\r\nof the alms-bowl was everywhere. In a few minutes the Curator saw that\r\nhis guest was no mere bead-telling mendicant, but a scholar of parts.\r\nAnd they went at it all over again, the lama taking snuff, wiping his\r\nspectacles, and talking at railway speed in a bewildering mixture of\r\nUrdu and Tibetan. He had heard of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims,\r\nFu-Hiouen and Hwen-Tsiang, and was anxious to know if there was any\r\ntranslation of their record. He drew in his breath as he turned\r\nhelplessly over the pages of Beal and Stanislas Julien. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis all here.\r\nA treasure locked.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he composed himself reverently to listen to\r\nfragments hastily rendered into Urdu. For the first time he heard of\r\nthe labours of European scholars, who by the help of these and a\r\nhundred other documents have identified the Holy Places of Buddhism.\r\nThen he was shown a mighty map, spotted and traced with yellow. The\r\nbrown finger followed the Curator\xe2\x80\x99s pencil from point to point. Here\r\nwas Kapilavastu, here the Middle Kingdom, and here Mahabodhi, the Mecca\r\nof Buddhism; and here was Kusinagara, sad place of the Holy One\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath. The old man bowed his head over the sheets in silence for a\r\nwhile, and the Curator lit another pipe. Kim had fallen asleep. When he\r\nwaked, the talk, still in spate, was more within his comprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thus it was, O Fountain of Wisdom, that I decided to go to the\r\nHoly Places which His foot had trod\xe2\x80\x94to the Birthplace, even to Kapila;\r\nthen to Mahabodhi, which is Buddh Gaya\xe2\x80\x94to the Monastery\xe2\x80\x94to the\r\nDeer-park\xe2\x80\x94to the place of His death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama lowered his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I come here alone. For\r\nfive\xe2\x80\x94seven\xe2\x80\x94eighteen\xe2\x80\x94forty years it was in my mind that the Old Law was\r\nnot well followed; being overlaid, as thou knowest, with devildom,\r\ncharms, and idolatry. Even as the child outside said but now. Ay, even\r\nas the child said, with _b\xc5\xabt-parasti_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it comes with all faiths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThinkest thou? The books of my lamassery I read, and they were dried\r\npith; and the later ritual with which we of the Reformed Law have\r\ncumbered ourselves\xe2\x80\x94that, too, had no worth to these old eyes. Even the\r\nfollowers of the Excellent One are at feud on feud with one another. It\r\nis all illusion. Ay, _maya_, illusion. But I have another desire\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nseamed yellow face drew within three inches of the Curator, and the\r\nlong forefinger-nail tapped on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cYour scholars, by these\r\nbooks, have followed the Blessed Feet in all their wanderings; but\r\nthere are things which they have not sought out. I know nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\ndo I know\xe2\x80\x94but I go to free myself from the Wheel of Things by a broad\r\nand open road.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled with most simple triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a pilgrim to\r\nthe Holy Places I acquire merit. But there is more. Listen to a true\r\nthing. When our gracious Lord, being as yet a youth, sought a mate, men\r\nsaid, in His father\xe2\x80\x99s Court, that He was too tender for marriage. Thou\r\nknowest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Curator nodded, wondering what would come next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they made the triple trial of strength against all comers. And at\r\nthe test of the Bow, our Lord first breaking that which they gave Him,\r\ncalled for such a bow as none might bend. Thou knowest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is written. I have read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, overshooting all other marks, the arrow passed far and far beyond\r\nsight. At the last it fell; and, where it touched earth, there broke\r\nout a stream which presently became a River, whose nature, by our\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x99s beneficence, and that merit He acquired ere He freed himself, is\r\nthat whoso bathes in it washes away all taint and speckle of sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is written,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Curator sadly.\r\n\r\nThe lama drew a long breath. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that River? Fountain of Wisdom,\r\nwhere fell the arrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, my brother, I do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Curator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, if it please thee to forget\xe2\x80\x94the one thing only that thou hast not\r\ntold me. Surely thou must know? See, I am an old man! I ask with my\r\nhead between thy feet, O Fountain of Wisdom. We _know_ He drew the bow!\r\nWe _know_ the arrow fell! We know the stream gushed! Where, then, is\r\nthe River? My dream told me to find it. So I came. I am here. But where\r\nis the River?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I knew, think you I would not cry it aloud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy it one attains freedom from the Wheel of Things,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama went on,\r\nunheeding. \xe2\x80\x9cThe River of the Arrow! Think again! Some little stream,\r\nmaybe\xe2\x80\x94dried in the heats? But the Holy One would never so cheat an old\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama brought his thousand-wrinkled face once more a handsbreadth\r\nfrom the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cI see thou dost not know. Not being of the Law,\r\nthe matter is hid from thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94hidden\xe2\x80\x94hidden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are both bound, thou and I, my brother. But I\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he rose with a sweep\r\nof the soft thick drapery\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI go to cut myself free. Come also!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am bound,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Curator. \xe2\x80\x9cBut whither goest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst to Kashi [Benares]: where else? There I shall meet one of the\r\npure faith in a Jain temple of that city. He also is a Seeker in\r\nsecret, and from him haply I may learn. Maybe he will go with me to\r\nBuddh Gaya. Thence north and west to Kapilavastu, and there will I seek\r\nfor the River. Nay, I will seek everywhere as I go\xe2\x80\x94for the place is not\r\nknown where the arrow fell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how wilt thou go? It is a far cry to Delhi, and farther to\r\nBenares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy road and the trains. From Path\xc3\xa2nkot, having left the Hills, I came\r\nhither in a _te-rain_. It goes swiftly. At first I was amazed to see\r\nthose tall poles by the side of the road snatching up and snatching up\r\ntheir threads,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he illustrated the stoop and whirl of a telegraph-pole\r\nflashing past the train. \xe2\x80\x9cBut later, I was cramped and desired to walk,\r\nas I am used.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou art sure of thy road?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Curator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for that one but asks a question and pays money, and the appointed\r\npersons despatch all to the appointed place. That much I knew in my\r\nlamassery from sure report,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when dost thou go?\xe2\x80\x9d The Curator smiled at the mixture of old-world\r\npiety and modern progress that is the note of India today.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as may be. I follow the places of His life till I come to the\r\nRiver of the Arrow. There is, moreover, a written paper of the hours of\r\nthe trains that go south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for food?\xe2\x80\x9d Lamas, as a rule, have good store of money somewhere\r\nabout them, but the Curator wished to make sure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the journey, I take up the Master\xe2\x80\x99s begging-bowl. Yes. Even as He\r\nwent so go I, forsaking the ease of my monastery. There was with me\r\nwhen I left the hills a _chela_ (disciple) who begged for me as the\r\nRule demands, but halting in Kulu awhile a fever took him and he died.\r\nI have now no _chela_, but I will take the alms-bowl and thus enable\r\nthe charitable to acquire merit.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded his head valiantly. Learned\r\ndoctors of a lamassery do not beg, but the lama was an enthusiast in\r\nthis quest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Curator, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cSuffer me now to acquire merit.\r\nWe be craftsmen together, thou and I. Here is a new book of white\r\nEnglish paper: here be sharpened pencils two and three\xe2\x80\x94thick and thin,\r\nall good for a scribe. Now lend me thy spectacles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Curator looked through them. They were heavily scratched, but the\r\npower was almost exactly that of his own pair, which he slid into the\r\nlama\xe2\x80\x99s hand, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cTry these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA feather! A very feather upon the face.\xe2\x80\x9d The old man turned his head\r\ndelightedly and wrinkled up his nose. \xe2\x80\x9cHow scarcely do I feel them! How\r\nclearly do I see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey be _bilaur_\xe2\x80\x94crystal\xe2\x80\x94and will never scratch. May they help thee to\r\nthy River, for they are thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take them and the pencils and the white note-book,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlama, \xe2\x80\x9cas a sign of friendship between priest and priest\xe2\x80\x94and now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nfumbled at his belt, detached the open-work iron pincers, and laid it\r\non the Curator\xe2\x80\x99s table. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is for a memory between thee and me\xe2\x80\x94my\r\npencase. It is something old\xe2\x80\x94even as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a piece of ancient design, Chinese, of an iron that is not\r\nsmelted these days; and the collector\xe2\x80\x99s heart in the Curator\xe2\x80\x99s bosom\r\nhad gone out to it from the first. For no persuasion would the lama\r\nresume his gift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I return, having found the River, I will bring thee a written\r\npicture of the Padma Samthora such as I used to make on silk at the\r\nlamassery. Yes\xe2\x80\x94and of the Wheel of Life,\xe2\x80\x9d he chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we be\r\ncraftsmen together, thou and I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Curator would have detained him: they are few in the world who\r\nstill have the secret of the conventional brush-pen Buddhist pictures\r\nwhich are, as it were, half written and half drawn. But the lama strode\r\nout, head high in air, and pausing an instant before the great statue\r\nof a Bodhisat in meditation, brushed through the turnstiles.\r\n\r\nKim followed like a shadow. What he had overheard excited him wildly.\r\nThis man was entirely new to all his experience, and he meant to\r\ninvestigate further, precisely as he would have investigated a new\r\nbuilding or a strange festival in Lahore city. The lama was his trove,\r\nand he purposed to take possession. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s mother had been Irish, too.\r\n\r\nThe old man halted by Zam-Zammah and looked round till his eye fell on\r\nKim. The inspiration of his pilgrimage had left him for awhile, and he\r\nfelt old, forlorn, and very empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not sit under that gun,\xe2\x80\x9d said the policeman loftily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! Owl!\xe2\x80\x9d was Kim\xe2\x80\x99s retort on the lama\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. \xe2\x80\x9cSit under that gun\r\nif it please thee. When didst thou steal the milkwoman\xe2\x80\x99s slippers,\r\nDunnoo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was an utterly unfounded charge sprung on the spur of the moment,\r\nbut it silenced Dunnoo, who knew that Kim\xe2\x80\x99s clear yell could call up\r\nlegions of bad bazaar boys if need arose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whom didst thou worship within?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim affably, squatting in\r\nthe shade beside the lama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI worshipped none, child. I bowed before the Excellent Law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim accepted this new God without emotion. He knew already a few score.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what dost thou do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg. I remember now it is long since I have eaten or drunk. What is\r\nthe custom of charity in this town? In silence, as we do of Tibet, or\r\nspeaking aloud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who beg in silence starve in silence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, quoting a\r\nnative proverb. The lama tried to rise, but sank back again, sighing\r\nfor his disciple, dead in far-away Kulu. Kim watched head to one side,\r\nconsidering and interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the bowl. I know the people of this city\xe2\x80\x94all who are\r\ncharitable. Give, and I will bring it back filled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimply as a child the old man handed him the bowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest, thou. _I_ know the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe trotted off to the open shop of a _kunjri_, a low-caste\r\nvegetable-seller, which lay opposite the belt-tramway line down the\r\nMotee Bazar. She knew Kim of old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho, hast thou turned _yogi_ with thy begging-bowl?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay.\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a new priest in the city\xe2\x80\x94a man such\r\nas I have never seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld priest\xe2\x80\x94young tiger,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am tired of new\r\npriests! They settle on our wares like flies. Is the father of my son a\r\nwell of charity to give to all who ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cThy man is rather _yagi_ (bad-tempered) than _yogi_ (a\r\nholy man). But this priest is new. The Sahib in the Wonder House has\r\ntalked to him like a brother. O my mother, fill me this bowl. He\r\nwaits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat bowl indeed! That cow-bellied basket! Thou hast as much grace as\r\nthe holy bull of Shiv. He has taken the best of a basket of onions\r\nalready, this morn; and forsooth, I must fill thy bowl. He comes here\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe huge, mouse-coloured Brahmini bull of the ward was shouldering his\r\nway through the many-coloured crowd, a stolen plantain hanging out of\r\nhis mouth. He headed straight for the shop, well knowing his privileges\r\nas a sacred beast, lowered his head, and puffed heavily along the line\r\nof baskets ere making his choice. Up flew Kim\xe2\x80\x99s hard little heel and\r\ncaught him on his moist blue nose. He snorted indignantly, and walked\r\naway across the tram-rails, his hump quivering with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee! I have saved more than the bowl will cost thrice over. Now,\r\nmother, a little rice and some dried fish atop\xe2\x80\x94yes, and some vegetable\r\ncurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA growl came out of the back of the shop, where a man lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe drove away the bull,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman in an undertone. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is good\r\nto give to the poor.\xe2\x80\x9d She took the bowl and returned it full of hot\r\nrice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my _yogi_ is not a cow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim gravely, making a hole with his\r\nfingers in the top of the mound. \xe2\x80\x9cA little curry is good, and a fried\r\ncake, and a morsel of conserve would please him, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a hole as big as thy head,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman fretfully. But she\r\nfilled it, none the less, with good, steaming vegetable curry, clapped\r\na fried cake atop, and a morsel of clarified butter on the cake, dabbed\r\na lump of sour tamarind conserve at the side; and Kim looked at the\r\nload lovingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is good. When I am in the bazar the bull shall not come to this\r\nhouse. He is a bold beggar-man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut speak well of bulls. Hast thou not\r\ntold me that some day a Red Bull will come out of a field to help thee?\r\nNow hold all straight and ask for the holy man\xe2\x80\x99s blessing upon me.\r\nPerhaps, too, he knows a cure for my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s sore eyes. Ask. him\r\nthat also, O thou Little Friend of all the World.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Kim had danced off ere the end of the sentence, dodging pariah dogs\r\nand hungry acquaintances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus do we beg who know the way of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he proudly to the lama,\r\nwho opened his eyes at the contents of the bowl. \xe2\x80\x9cEat now and\xe2\x80\x94I will\r\neat with thee. Oh\xc3\xa9 _bhistie!_\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the water-carrier, sluicing\r\nthe crotons by the Museum. \xe2\x80\x9cGive water here. We men are thirsty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe men!\xe2\x80\x9d said the _bhistie_, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIs one skinful enough for such\r\na pair? Drink, then, in the name of the Compassionate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe loosed a thin stream into Kim\xe2\x80\x99s hands, who drank native fashion; but\r\nthe lama must needs pull out a cup from his inexhaustible upper\r\ndraperies and drink ceremonially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardesi_ (a foreigner),\xe2\x80\x9d Kim explained, as the old man delivered in\r\nan unknown tongue what was evidently a blessing.\r\n\r\nThey ate together in great content, clearing the beggingbowl. Then the\r\nlama took snuff from a portentous wooden snuff-gourd, fingered his\r\nrosary awhile, and so dropped into the easy sleep of age, as the shadow\r\nof Zam-Zammah grew long.\r\n\r\nKim loafed over to the nearest tobacco-seller, a rather lively young\r\nMohammedan woman, and begged a rank cigar of the brand that they sell\r\nto students of the Punjab University who copy English customs. Then he\r\nsmoked and thought, knees to chin, under the belly of the gun, and the\r\noutcome of his thoughts was a sudden and stealthy departure in the\r\ndirection of Nila Ram\xe2\x80\x99s timber-yard.\r\n\r\nThe lama did not wake till the evening life of the city had begun with\r\nlamp-lighting and the return of white-robed clerks and subordinates\r\nfrom the Government offices. He stared dizzily in all directions, but\r\nnone looked at him save a Hindu urchin in a dirty turban and\r\nIsabella-coloured clothes. Suddenly he bowed his head on his knees and\r\nwailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, standing before him. \xe2\x80\x9cHast thou been\r\nrobbed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my new _chela_ (disciple) that is gone away from me, and I know\r\nnot where he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what like of man was thy disciple?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a boy who came to me in place of him who died, on account of\r\nthe merit which I had gained when I bowed before the Law within there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe pointed towards the Museum. \xe2\x80\x9cHe came upon me to show me a road which\r\nI had lost. He led me into the Wonder House, and by his talk emboldened\r\nme to speak to the Keeper of the Images, so that I was cheered and made\r\nstrong. And when I was faint with hunger he begged for me, as would a\r\n_chela_ for his teacher. Suddenly was he sent. Suddenly has he gone\r\naway. It was in my mind to have taught him the Law upon the road to\r\nBenares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim stood amazed at this, because he had overheard the talk in the\r\nMuseum, and knew that the old man was speaking the truth, which is a\r\nthing a native on the road seldom presents to a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I see now that he was but sent for a purpose. By this I know that\r\nI shall find a certain River for which I seek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe River of the Arrow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, with a superior smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this yet another Sending?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cTo none have I spoken\r\nof my search, save to the Priest of the Images. Who art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy _chela_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim simply, sitting on his heels. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never\r\nseen anyone like to thee in all this my life. I go with thee to\r\nBenares. And, too, I think that so old a man as thou, speaking the\r\ntruth to chance-met people at dusk, is in great need of a disciple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the River\xe2\x80\x94the River of the Arrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that I heard when thou wast speaking to the Englishman. I lay\r\nagainst the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought thou hadst been a guide permitted. Such\r\nthings fall sometimes\xe2\x80\x94but I am not worthy. Thou dost not, then, know\r\nthe River?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim laughed uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cI go to look for\xe2\x80\x94for a bull\xe2\x80\x94a Red. Bull\r\non a green field who shall help me.\xe2\x80\x9d Boylike, if an acquaintance had a\r\nscheme, Kim was quite ready with one of his own; and, boylike, he had\r\nreally thought for as much as twenty minutes at a time of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what, child?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows, but so my father told me\xe2\x80\x9d. I heard thy talk in the Wonder\r\nHouse of all those new strange places in the Hills, and if one so old\r\nand so little\xe2\x80\x94so used to truth-telling\xe2\x80\x94may go out for the small matter\r\nof a river, it seemed to me that I too must go a-travelling. If it is\r\nour fate to find those things we shall find them\xe2\x80\x94thou, thy River; and\r\nI, my Bull, and the Strong Pillars and some other matters that I\r\nforget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not pillars but a Wheel from which I would be free,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all one. Perhaps they will make me a king,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, serenely\r\nprepared for anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will teach thee other and better desires upon the road,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama\r\nreplied in the voice of authority. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to Benares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by night. Thieves are abroad. Wait till the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is no place to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d The old man was used to the order of\r\nhis monastery, and though he slept on the ground, as the Rule decrees,\r\npreferred a decency in these things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall get good lodging at the Kashmir Serai,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, laughing at\r\nhis perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a friend there. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hot and crowded bazars blazed with light as they made their way\r\nthrough the press of all the races in Upper India, and the lama mooned\r\nthrough it like a man in a dream. It was his first experience of a\r\nlarge manufacturing city, and the crowded tram-car with its continually\r\nsquealing brakes frightened him. Half pushed, half towed, he arrived at\r\nthe high gate of the Kashmir Serai: that huge open square over against\r\nthe railway station, surrounded with arched cloisters, where the camel\r\nand horse caravans put up on their return from Central Asia. Here were\r\nall manner of Northern folk, tending tethered ponies and kneeling\r\ncamels; loading and unloading bales and bundles; drawing water for the\r\nevening meal at the creaking well-windlasses; piling grass before the\r\nshrieking, wild-eyed stallions; cuffing the surly caravan dogs; paying\r\noff camel-drivers; taking on new grooms; swearing, shouting, arguing,\r\nand chaffering in the packed square. The cloisters, reached by three or\r\nfour masonry steps, made a haven of refuge around this turbulent sea.\r\nMost of them were rented to traders, as we rent the arches of a\r\nviaduct; the space between pillar and pillar being bricked or boarded\r\noff into rooms, which were guarded by heavy wooden doors and cumbrous\r\nnative padlocks. Locked doors showed that the owner was away, and a few\r\nrude\xe2\x80\x94sometimes very rude\xe2\x80\x94chalk or paint scratches told where he had\r\ngone. Thus: \xe2\x80\x9cLutuf Ullah is gone to Kurdistan.\xe2\x80\x9d Below, in coarse verse:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Allah, who sufferest lice to live on the coat of a Kabuli, why hast\r\nthou allowed this louse Lutuf to live so long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim, fending the lama between excited men and excited beasts, sidled\r\nalong the cloisters to the far end, nearest therailway station, where\r\nMahbub Ali, the horse-trader, lived when he came in from that\r\nmysterious land beyond the Passes of the North.\r\n\r\nKim had had many dealings with Mahbub in his little life, especially\r\nbetween his tenth and his thirteenth year\xe2\x80\x94and the big burly Afghan, his\r\nbeard dyed scarlet with lime (for he was elderly and did not wish his\r\ngrey hairs to show), knew the boy\xe2\x80\x99s value as a gossip. Sometimes he\r\nwould tell Kim to watch a man who had nothing whatever to do with\r\nhorses: to follow him for one whole day and report every soul with whom\r\nhe talked. Kim would deliver himself of his tale at evening, and Mahbub\r\nwould listen without a word or gesture. It was intrigue of some kind,\r\nKim knew; but its worth lay in saying nothing whatever to anyone except\r\nMahbub, who gave him beautiful meals all hot from the cookshop at the\r\nhead of the serai, and once as much as eight annas in money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, hitting a bad-tempered camel on the nose. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xc3\xa9,\r\nMahbub Ali!\xe2\x80\x9d He halted at a dark arch and slipped behind the bewildered\r\nlama.\r\n\r\nThe horse-trader, his deep, embroidered Bokhariot belt unloosed, was\r\nlying on a pair of silk carpet saddle-bags, pulling lazily at an\r\nimmense silver hookah. He turned his head very slightly at the cry; and\r\nseeing only the tall silent figure, chuckled in his deep chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah! A lama! A Red Lama! It is far from Lahore to the Passes. What\r\ndost thou do here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama held out the begging-bowl mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s curse on all unbelievers!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not give to a\r\nlousy Tibetan; but ask my Baltis over yonder behind the camels. They\r\nmay value your blessings. Oh, horseboys, here is a countryman of yours.\r\nSee if he be hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shaven, crouching Balti, who had come down with the horses, and who\r\nwas nominally some sort of degraded Buddhist, fawned upon the priest,\r\nand in thick gutturals besought the Holy One to sit at the horseboys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, pushing him lightly, and the lama strode away, leaving\r\nKim at the edge of the cloister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub Ali, returning to his hookah. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Hindu, run\r\naway. God\xe2\x80\x99s curse on all unbelievers! Beg from those of my tail who are\r\nof thy faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaharaj,\xe2\x80\x9d whined Kim, using the Hindu form of address, and thoroughly\r\nenjoying the situation; \xe2\x80\x9cmy father is dead\xe2\x80\x94my mother is dead\xe2\x80\x94my stomach\r\nis empty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg from my men among the horses, I say. There must be some Hindus in\r\nmy tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mahbub Ali, but am _I_ a Hindu?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim in English.\r\n\r\nThe trader gave no sign of astonishment, but looked under shaggy\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Friend of all the World,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I am now that holy man\xe2\x80\x99s disciple; and we go a pilgrimage\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94to Benares, he says. He is quite mad, and I am tired of Lahore\r\ncity. I wish new air and water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for whom dost thou work? Why come to me?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was harsh with\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom else should I come? I have no money. It is not good to go\r\nabout without money. Thou wilt sell many horses to the officers. They\r\nare very fine horses, these new ones: I have seen them. Give me a\r\nrupee, Mahbub Ali, and when I come to my wealth I will give thee a bond\r\nand pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub Ali, thinking swiftly. \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast never before lied\r\nto me. Call that lama\xe2\x80\x94stand back in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, our tales will agree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe go to Benares,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, as soon as he understood the drift\r\nof Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s questions. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy and I, I go to seek for a certain\r\nRiver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe\xe2\x80\x94but the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my disciple. He was sent, I think, to guide me to that River.\r\nSitting under a gun was I when he came suddenly. Such things have\r\nbefallen the fortunate to whom guidance was allowed. But I remember\r\nnow, he said he was of this world\xe2\x80\x94a Hindu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I did not ask. Is he not my disciple?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis country\xe2\x80\x94his race\xe2\x80\x94his village? Mussalman\xe2\x80\x94Sikh Hindu\xe2\x80\x94Jain\xe2\x80\x94low caste\r\nor high?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I ask? There is neither high nor low in the Middle Way. If\r\nhe is my _chela_\xe2\x80\x94does\xe2\x80\x94will\xe2\x80\x94can anyone take him from me? for, look you,\r\nwithout him I shall not find my River.\xe2\x80\x9d He wagged his head solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone shall take him from thee. Go, sit among my Baltis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub\r\nAli, and the lama drifted off, soothed by the promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he not quite mad?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, coming forward to the light again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I lie to thee, Hajji?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahbub puffed his hookah in silence. Then he began, almost whispering:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmballa is on the road to Benares\xe2\x80\x94if indeed ye two go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTck! Tck! I tell thee he does not know how to lie\xe2\x80\x94as we two know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if thou wilt carry a message for me as far as Umballa, I will give\r\nthee money. It concerns a horse\xe2\x80\x94a white stallion which I have sold to\r\nan officer upon the last time I returned from the Passes. But\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94stand nearer and hold up hands as begging\xe2\x80\x94the pedigree of the\r\nwhite stallion was not fully established, and that officer, who is now\r\nat Umballa, bade me make it clear.\xe2\x80\x9d (Mahbub here described the horse\r\nand the appearance of the officer.) \xe2\x80\x9cSo the message to that officer\r\nwill be: \xe2\x80\x98The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.\xe2\x80\x99 By\r\nthis will he know that thou comest from me. He will then say \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nproof hast thou?\xe2\x80\x99 and thou wilt answer: \xe2\x80\x98Mahbub Ali has given me the\r\nproof.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all for the sake of a white stallion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, with a giggle,\r\nhis eyes aflame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat pedigree I will give thee now\xe2\x80\x94in my own fashion and some hard\r\nwords as well.\xe2\x80\x9d A shadow passed behind Kim, and a feeding camel. Mahbub\r\nAli raised his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah! Art thou the only beggar in the city? Thy mother is dead. Thy\r\nfather is dead. So is it with all of them. Well, well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned as feeling on the floor beside him and tossed a flap of soft,\r\ngreasy Mussalman bread to the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and lie down among my horseboys\r\nfor tonight\xe2\x80\x94thou and the lama. Tomorrow I may give thee service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim slunk away, his teeth in the bread, and, as he expected, he found a\r\nsmall wad of folded tissue-paper wrapped in oilskin, with three silver\r\nrupees\xe2\x80\x94enormous largesse. He smiled and thrust money and paper into his\r\nleather amulet-case. The lama, sumptuously fed by Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s Baltis, was\r\nalready asleep in a corner of one of the stalls. Kim lay down beside\r\nhim and laughed. He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub Ali, and\r\nnot for one little minute did he believe the tale of the stallion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npedigree.\r\n\r\nBut Kim did not suspect that Mahbub Ali, known as one of the best\r\nhorse-dealers in the Punjab, a wealthy and enterprising trader, whose\r\ncaravans penetrated far and far into the Back of Beyond, was registered\r\nin one of the locked books of the Indian Survey Department as C25 IB.\r\nTwice or thrice yearly C25 would send in a little story, baldly told\r\nbut most interesting, and generally\xe2\x80\x94it was checked by the statements of\r\nR17 and M4\xe2\x80\x94quite true. It concerned all manner of out-of-the-way\r\nmountain principalities, explorers of nationalities other than English,\r\nand the guntrade\xe2\x80\x94was, in brief, a small portion of that vast mass of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinformation received\xe2\x80\x9d on which the Indian Government acts. But,\r\nrecently, five confederated Kings, who had no business to confederate,\r\nhad been informed by a kindly Northern Power that there was a leakage\r\nof news from their territories into British India. So those Kings\xe2\x80\x99\r\nPrime Ministers were seriously annoyed and took steps, after the\r\nOriental fashion. They suspected, among many others, the bullying,\r\nred-bearded horsedealer whose caravans ploughed through their\r\nfastnesses belly-deep in snow. At least, his caravan that season had\r\nbeen ambushed and shot at twice on the way down, when Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s men\r\naccounted for three strange ruffians who might, or might not, have been\r\nhired for the job. Therefore Mahbub had avoided halting at the\r\ninsalubrious city of Peshawur, and had come through without stop to\r\nLahore, where, knowing his country-people, he anticipated curious\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nAnd there was that on Mahbub Ali which he did not wish to keep an hour\r\nlonger than was necessary\xe2\x80\x94a wad of closely folded tissue-paper, wrapped\r\nin oilskin\xe2\x80\x94an impersonal, unaddressed statement, with five microscopic\r\npin-holes in one corner, that most scandalously betrayed the five\r\nconfederated Kings, the sympathetic Northern Power, a Hindu banker in\r\nPeshawur, a firm of gun-makers in Belgium, and an important,\r\nsemi-independent Mohammedan ruler to the south. This last was R17\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, which Mahbub had picked up beyond the Dora Pass and was carrying\r\nin for R17, who, owing to circumstances over which he had no control,\r\ncould not leave his post of observation. Dynamite was milky and\r\ninnocuous beside that report of C25; and even an Oriental, with an\r\nOriental\xe2\x80\x99s views of the value of time, could see that the sooner it was\r\nin the proper hands the better. Mahbub had no particular desire to die\r\nby violence, because two or three family blood-feuds across the Border\r\nhung unfinished on his hands, and when these scores were cleared he\r\nintended to settle down as a more or less virtuous citizen. He had\r\nnever passed the serai gate since his arrival two days ago, but had\r\nbeen ostentatious in sending telegrams to Bombay, where he banked some\r\nof his money; to Delhi, where a sub-partner of his own clan was selling\r\nhorses to the agent of a Rajputana state; and to Umballa, where an\r\nEnglishman was excitedly demanding the pedigree of a white stallion.\r\nThe public letter-writer, who knew English, composed excellent\r\ntelegrams, such as: \xe2\x80\x9c_Creighton, Laurel Bank, Umballa. Horse is Arabian\r\nas already advised. Sorrowful delayed pedigree which am translating._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd later to the same address: \xe2\x80\x9c_Much sorrowful delay. Will forward\r\npedigree._\xe2\x80\x9d To his sub-partner at Delhi he wired: \xe2\x80\x9c_Lutuf Ullah. Have\r\nwired two thousand rupees your credit Luchman Narain\xe2\x80\x99s bank._\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nwas entirely in the way of trade, but every one of those telegrams was\r\ndiscussed and rediscussed, by parties who conceived themselves to be\r\ninterested, before they went over to the railway station in charge of a\r\nfoolish Balti, who allowed all sorts of people to read them on the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nWhen, in Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s own picturesque language, he had muddied the wells of\r\ninquiry with the stick of precaution, Kim had dropped on him, sent from\r\nHeaven; and, being as prompt as he was unscrupulous, Mahbub Ali used to\r\ntaking all sorts of gusty chances, pressed him into service on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nA wandering lama with a low-caste boy-servant might attract a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest as they wandered about India, the land of pilgrims; but no one\r\nwould suspect them or, what was more to the point, rob.\r\n\r\nHe called for a new light-ball to his hookah, and considered the case.\r\nIf the worst came to the worst, and the boy came to harm, the paper\r\nwould incriminate nobody. And he would go up to Umballa leisurely\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94at a certain risk of exciting fresh suspicion\xe2\x80\x94repeat his tale by\r\nword of mouth to the people concerned.\r\n\r\nBut R17\xe2\x80\x99s report was the kernel of the whole affair, and it would be\r\ndistinctly inconvenient if that failed to come to hand. However, God\r\nwas great, and Mahbub Ali felt he had done all he could for the time\r\nbeing. Kim was the one soul in the world who had never told him a lie.\r\nThat would have been a fatal blot on Kim\xe2\x80\x99s character if Mahbub had not\r\nknown that to others, for his own ends or Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s business, Kim could\r\nlie like an Oriental.\r\n\r\nThen Mahbub Ali rolled across the serai to the Gate of the Harpies who\r\npaint their eyes and trap the stranger, and was at some pains to call\r\non the one girl who, he had reason to believe, was a particular friend\r\nof a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit who had waylaid his simple Balti in\r\nthe matter of the telegrams. It was an utterly foolish thing to do;\r\nbecause they fell to drinking perfumed brandy against the Law of the\r\nProphet, and Mahbub grew wonderfully drunk, and the gates of his mouth\r\nwere loosened, and he pursued the Flower of Delight with the feet of\r\nintoxication till he fell flat among the cushions, where the Flower of\r\nDelight, aided by a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit, searched him from\r\nhead to foot most thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAbout the same hour Kim heard soft feet in Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s deserted stall. The\r\nhorse-trader, curiously enough, had left his door unlocked, and his men\r\nwere busy celebrating their return to India with a whole sheep of\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s bounty. A sleek young gentleman from Delhi, armed with a bunch\r\nof keys which the Flower had unshackled from the senseless one\xe2\x80\x99s belt,\r\nwent through every single box, bundle, mat, and saddle-bag in Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossession even more systematically than the Flower and the pundit were\r\nsearching the owner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think.\xe2\x80\x9d said the Flower scornfully an hour later, one rounded\r\nelbow on the snoring carcass, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he is no more than a pig of an\r\nAfghan horse-dealer, with no thought except women and horses. Moreover,\r\nhe may have sent it away by now\xe2\x80\x94if ever there were such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay\xe2\x80\x94in a matter touching Five Kings it would be next his black heart,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the pundit. \xe2\x80\x9cWas there nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Delhi man laughed and resettled his turban as he entered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsearched between the soles of his slippers as the Flower searched his\r\nclothes. This is not the man but another. I leave little unseen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey did not say he was the very man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pundit thoughtfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey said, \xe2\x80\x98Look if he be the man, since our counsels are troubled.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat North country is full of horse-dealers as an old coat of lice.\r\nThere is Sikandar Khan, Nur Ali Beg, and Farrukh Shah all heads of\r\nkafilas [caravans]\xe2\x80\x94who deal there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Flower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have not yet come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pundit. \xe2\x80\x9cThou must ensnare them\r\nlater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhew!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Flower with deep disgust, rolling Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s head from\r\nher lap. \xe2\x80\x9cI earn my money. Farrukh Shah is a bear, Ali Beg a\r\nswashbuckler, and old Sikandar Khan\xe2\x80\x94yaie! Go! I sleep now. This swine\r\nwill not stir till dawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mahbub woke, the Flower talked to him severely on the sin of\r\ndrunkenness. Asiatics do not wink when they have outmanoeuvred an\r\nenemy, but as Mahbub Ali cleared his throat, tightened his belt, and\r\nstaggered forth under the early morning stars, he came very near to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a colt\xe2\x80\x99s trick!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if every girl in\r\nPeshawur did not use it! But \xe2\x80\x99twas prettily done. Now God He knows how\r\nmany more there be upon the Road who have orders to test me\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\nwith the knife. So it stands that the boy must go to Umballa\xe2\x80\x94and by\r\nrail\xe2\x80\x94for the writing is something urgent. I abide here, following the\r\nFlower and drinking wine as an Afghan coper should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe halted at the stall next but one to his own. His men lay there heavy\r\nwith sleep. There was no sign of Kim or the lama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp!\xe2\x80\x9d He stirred a sleeper. \xe2\x80\x9cWhither went those who lay here last\r\neven\xe2\x80\x94the lama and the boy? Is aught missing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted the man, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old madman rose at second cockcrow saying\r\nhe would go to Benares, and the young one led him away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe curse of Allah on all unbelievers!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub heartily, and\r\nclimbed into his own stall, growling in his beard.\r\n\r\nBut it was Kim who had wakened the lama\xe2\x80\x94Kim with one eye laid against a\r\nknot-hole in the planking, who had seen the Delhi man\xe2\x80\x99s search through\r\nthe boxes. This was no common thief that turned over letters, bills,\r\nand saddles\xe2\x80\x94no mere burglar who ran a little knife sideways into the\r\nsoles of Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s slippers, or picked the seams of the saddle-bags so\r\ndeftly. At first Kim had been minded to give the alarm\xe2\x80\x94the long-drawn\r\n_cho-or\xe2\x80\x94choor!_ (thief! thief!) that sets the serai ablaze of nights;\r\nbut he looked more carefully, and, hand on amulet, drew his own\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be the pedigree of that made-up horse-lie,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nthing that I carry to Umballa. Better that we go now. Those who search\r\nbags with knives may presently search bellies with knives. Surely there\r\nis a woman behind this. Hai! Hai! in a whisper to the light-sleeping\r\nold man. \xe2\x80\x9cCome. It is time\xe2\x80\x94time to go to Benares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama rose obediently, and they passed out of the serai like\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whoso will, from Pride released;\r\nContemning neither creed nor priest,\r\nMay feel the Soul of all the East.\r\n    About him at Kamakura.\r\n\r\nThey entered the fort-like railway station, black in the end of night;\r\nthe electrics sizzling over the goods-yard where they handle the heavy\r\nNorthern grain-traffic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the work of devils!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, recoiling from the hollow\r\nechoing darkness, the glimmer of rails between the masonry platforms,\r\nand the maze of girders above. He stood in a gigantic stone hall paved,\r\nit seemed, with the sheeted dead third-class passengers who had taken\r\ntheir tickets overnight and were sleeping in the waiting-rooms. All\r\nhours of the twenty-four are alike to Orientals, and their passenger\r\ntraffic is regulated accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where the fire-carriages come. One stands behind that\r\nhole\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim pointed to the ticket-office\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwho will give thee a paper to\r\ntake thee to Umballa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we go to Benares,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied petulantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll one. Benares then. Quick: she comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake thou the purse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama, not so well used to trains as he had pretended, started as\r\nthe 3.25 a.m. south-bound roared in. The sleepers sprang to life, and\r\nthe station filled with clamour and shoutings, cries of water and\r\nsweetmeat vendors, shouts of native policemen, and shrill yells of\r\nwomen gathering up their baskets, their families, and their husbands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the train\xe2\x80\x94only the _te-rain_. It will not come here. Wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAmazed at the lama\xe2\x80\x99s immense simplicity (he had handed him a small bag\r\nfull of rupees), Kim asked and paid for a ticket to Umballa. A sleepy\r\nclerk grunted and flung out a ticket to the next station, just six\r\nmiles distant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, scanning it with a grin. \xe2\x80\x9cThis may serve for farmers,\r\nbut I live in the city of Lahore. It was cleverly done, Babu. Now give\r\nthe ticket to Umballa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow another to Amritzar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, who had no notion of spending\r\nMahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nprice is so much. The small money in return is just so much. I know the\r\nways of the _te-rain_ ... Never did _yogi_ need _chela_ as thou dost,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe went on merrily to the bewildered lama. \xe2\x80\x9cThey would have flung thee\r\nout at Mian Mir but for me. This way! Come!\xe2\x80\x9d He returned the money,\r\nkeeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the Umballa ticket\r\nas his commission\xe2\x80\x94the immemorial commission of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third-class carriage.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere it not better to walk?\xe2\x80\x9d said he weakly.\r\n\r\nA burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he afraid? Do\r\nnot be afraid. I remember the time when I was afraid of the train.\r\nEnter! This thing is the work of the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cHave ye room within for two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no room even for a mouse,\xe2\x80\x9d shrilled the wife of a well-to-do\r\ncultivator\xe2\x80\x94a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur, district. Our night\r\ntrains are not as well looked after as the day ones, where the sexes\r\nare very strictly kept to separate carriages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mother of my son, we can make space,\xe2\x80\x9d said the blueturbaned\r\nhusband. \xe2\x80\x9cPick up the child. It is a holy man, see\xe2\x80\x99st thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my lap full of seventy times seven bundles! Why not bid him sit on\r\nmy knee, Shameless? But men are ever thus!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked round for\r\napproval. An Amritzar courtesan near the window sniffed behind her head\r\ndrapery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnter! Enter!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a fat Hindu money-lender, his folded account-book\r\nin a cloth under his arm. With an oily smirk: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is well to be kind to\r\nthe poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, at seven per cent a month with a mortgage on the unborn calf,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid a young Dogra soldier going south on leave; and they all laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it travel to Benares?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly. Else why should we come? Enter, or we are left,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d shrilled the Amritzar girl. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has never entered a train. Oh,\r\nsee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, help,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cultivator, putting out a large brown hand and\r\nhauling him in. \xe2\x80\x9cThus is it done, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94I sit on the floor. It is against the Rule to sit on a bench,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, it cramps me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d began the money-lender, pursing his lips, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is not\r\none rule of right living which these _te-rains_ do not cause us to\r\nbreak. We sit, for example, side by side with all castes and peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, and with most outrageously shameless ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife,\r\nscowling at the Amritzar girl making eyes at the young sepoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said we might have gone by cart along the road,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand thus have saved some money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and spent twice over what we saved on food by the way. That was\r\ntalked out ten thousand times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, by ten thousand tongues,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gods help us poor women if we may not speak. Oho! He is of that\r\nsort which may not look at or reply to a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d For the lama,\r\nconstrained by his Rule, took not the faintest notice of her. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd his\r\ndisciple is like him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim most promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot when the woman is\r\nwell-looking and above all charitable to the hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beggar\xe2\x80\x99s answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sikh, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast brought it on\r\nthyself, sister!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\xe2\x80\x99s hands were crooked in supplication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whither goest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, handing him the half of a\r\ncake from a greasy package.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven to Benares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJugglers belike?\xe2\x80\x9d the young soldier suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cHave ye any tricks to\r\npass the time? Why does not that yellow man answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim stoutly, \xe2\x80\x9che is holy, and thinks upon matters\r\nhidden from thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be well. We of the Ludhiana Sikhs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he rolled it out\r\nsonorously\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdo not trouble our heads with doctrine. We fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister\xe2\x80\x99s brother\xe2\x80\x99s son is _naik_ (corporal) in that regiment,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Sikh craftsman quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are also some Dogra companies\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d The soldier glared, for a Dogra is of other caste than a Sikh,\r\nand the banker tittered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all one to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Amritzar girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we believe,\xe2\x80\x9d snorted the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife malignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their hands are, as\r\nit were, one brotherhood. There is one brotherhood of the caste, but\r\nbeyond that again\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she looked round timidly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe bond of the\r\n_Pulton_\xe2\x80\x94the Regiment\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother is in a Jat regiment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cultivator. \xe2\x80\x9cDogras be good\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy Sikhs at least were of that opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier, with a\r\nscowl at the placid old man in the corner. \xe2\x80\x9c_Thy_ Sikhs thought so when\r\nour two companies came to help them at the Pirzai Kotal in the face of\r\neight Afridi standards on the ridge not three months gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told the story of a Border action in which the Dogra companies of\r\nthe Ludhiana Sikhs had acquitted themselves well. The Amritzar girl\r\nsmiled; for she knew the talk was to win her approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife at the end. \xe2\x80\x9cSo their villages were\r\nburnt and their little children made homeless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had marked our dead. They paid a great payment after we of the\r\nSikhs had schooled them. So it was. Is this Amritzar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and here they cut our tickets,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, fumbling at his\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\nThe lamps were paling in the dawn when the half-caste guard came round.\r\nTicket-collecting is a slow business in the East, where people secrete\r\ntheir tickets in all sorts of curious places. Kim produced his and was\r\ntold to get out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I go to Umballa,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested. \xe2\x80\x9cI go with this holy man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou canst go to Jehannum for aught I care. This ticket is only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim burst into a flood of tears, protesting that the lama was his\r\nfather and his mother, that he was the prop of the lama\xe2\x80\x99s declining\r\nyears, and that the lama would die without his care. All the carriage\r\nbade the guard be merciful\xe2\x80\x94the banker was specially eloquent here\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthe guard hauled Kim on to the platform. The lama blinked\xe2\x80\x94he could not\r\novertake the situation and Kim lifted up his voice and wept outside the\r\ncarriage window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very poor. My father is dead\xe2\x80\x94my mother is dead. O charitable\r\nones, if I am left here, who shall tend that old man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d the lama repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must go to Benares. He must\r\ncome with me. He is my _chela_. If there is money to be paid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, be silent,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Kim; \xe2\x80\x9care we Rajahs to throw away good\r\nsilver when the world is so charitable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Amritzar girl stepped out with her bundles, and it was on her that\r\nKim kept his watchful eye. Ladies of that persuasion, he knew, were\r\ngenerous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ticket\xe2\x80\x94a little _tikkut_ to Umballa\xe2\x80\x94O Breaker of Hearts!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHast thou no charity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the holy man come from the North?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom far and far in the North he comes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom among the\r\nhills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is snow among the pine-trees in the North\xe2\x80\x94in the hills there is\r\nsnow. My mother was from Kulu. Get thee a ticket. Ask him for a\r\nblessing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand blessings,\xe2\x80\x9d shrilled Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cO Holy One, a woman has given\r\nus in charity so that I can come with thee\xe2\x80\x94a woman with a golden heart.\r\nI run for the _tikkut_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up at the lama, who had mechanically followed Kim to\r\nthe platform. He bowed his head that he might not see her, and muttered\r\nin Tibetan as she passed on with the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLight come\xe2\x80\x94light go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife viciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has acquired merit,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond doubt it was a\r\nnun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere be ten thousand such nuns in Amritzar alone. Return, old man, or\r\nthe _te-rain_ may depart without thee,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the banker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only was it sufficient for the ticket, but for a little food\r\nalso,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, leaping to his place. \xe2\x80\x9cNow eat, Holy One. Look. Day\r\ncomes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGolden, rose, saffron, and pink, the morning mists smoked away across\r\nthe flat green levels. All the rich Punjab lay out in the splendour of\r\nthe keen sun. The lama flinched a little as the telegraph-posts swung\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat is the speed of the _te-rain_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, with a\r\npatronizing grin. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have gone farther since Lahore than thou couldst\r\nwalk in two days: at even, we shall enter Umballa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is still far from Benares,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama wearily, mumbling\r\nover the cakes that Kim offered. They all unloosed their bundles and\r\nmade their morning meal. Then the banker, the cultivator, and the\r\nsoldier prepared their pipes and wrapped the compartment in choking,\r\nacrid smoke, spitting and coughing and enjoying themselves. The Sikh\r\nand the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife chewed _pan;_ the lama took snuff and told\r\nhis beads, while Kim, cross-legged, smiled over the comfort of a full\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat rivers have ye by Benares?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama of a sudden to the\r\ncarriage at large.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have Gunga,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the banker, when the little titter had\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat other than Gunga?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but in my mind was the thought of a certain River of healing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Gunga. Who bathes in her is made clean and goes to the Gods.\r\nThrice have I made pilgrimage to Gunga.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked round proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was need,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young sepoy drily, and the travellers\xe2\x80\x99 laugh\r\nturned against the banker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClean\xe2\x80\x94to return again to the Gods,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to go\r\nforth on the round of lives anew\xe2\x80\x94still tied to the Wheel.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his\r\nhead testily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut maybe there is a mistake. Who, then, made Gunga in\r\nthe beginning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gods. Of what known faith art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d the banker said, appalled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI follow the Law\xe2\x80\x94the Most Excellent Law. So it was the Gods that made\r\nGunga. What like of Gods were they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carriage looked at him in amazement. It was inconceivable that\r\nanyone should be ignorant of Gunga.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94what is thy God?\xe2\x80\x9d said the money-lender at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, shifting the rosary to his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHear: for I\r\nspeak of Him now! O people of Hind, listen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began in Urdu the tale of the Lord Buddha, but, borne by his own\r\nthoughts, slid into Tibetan and long-droned texts from a Chinese book\r\nof the Buddha\xe2\x80\x99s life. The gentle, tolerant folk looked on reverently.\r\nAll India is full of holy men stammering gospels in strange tongues;\r\nshaken and consumed in the fires of their own zeal; dreamers, babblers,\r\nand visionaries: as it has been from the beginning and will continue to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm!\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a Mohammedan\r\nregiment lay next to us at the Pirzai Kotal, and a priest of theirs\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas, as I remember, a _naik_\xe2\x80\x94when the fit was on him, spake prophecies.\r\nBut the mad all are in God\xe2\x80\x99s keeping. His officers overlooked much in\r\nthat man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama fell back on Urdu, remembering that he was in a strange land.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord loosed from the bow,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThis was much more to their taste, and they listened curiously while he\r\ntold it. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, O people of Hind, I go to seek that River. Know ye aught\r\nthat may guide me, for we be all men and women in evil case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is Gunga\xe2\x80\x94and Gunga alone\xe2\x80\x94who washes away sin.\xe2\x80\x9d ran the murmur\r\nround the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough past question we have good Gods Jullundur-way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, looking out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cSee how they have\r\nblessed the crops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo search every river in the Punjab is no small matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\nhusband. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, a stream that leaves good silt on my land suffices,\r\nand I thank Bhumia, the God of the Home-stead.\xe2\x80\x9d He shrugged one\r\nknotted, bronzed shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink you our Lord came so far North?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, turning to Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim replied soothingly, as he spat red _pan_-juice on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last of the Great Ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sikh with authority, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nSikander Julkarn [Alexander the Great]. He paved the streets of\r\nJullundur and built a great tank near Umballa. That pavement holds to\r\nthis day; and the tank is there also. I never heard of thy God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet thy hair grow long and talk Punjabi,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young soldier\r\njestingly to Kim, quoting a Northern proverb. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is all that makes a\r\nSikh.\xe2\x80\x9d But he did not say this very loud.\r\n\r\nThe lama sighed and shrank into himself, a dingy, shapeless mass. In\r\nthe pauses of their talk they could hear the low droning \xe2\x80\x9c_Om mane\r\npudme hum! Om mane pudme hum!_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the thick click of the wooden\r\nrosary beads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt irks me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cThe speed and the clatter irk me.\r\nMoreover, my _chela_, I think that maybe we have over-passed that\r\nRiver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, peace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cWas not the River near Benares? We are yet\r\nfar from the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94if our Lord came North, it may be any one of these little ones\r\nthat we have run across.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou wast sent to me\xe2\x80\x94wast thou sent to me?\xe2\x80\x94for the merit I had\r\nacquired over yonder at Such-zen. From beside the cannon didst thou\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94bearing two faces\xe2\x80\x94and two garbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace. One must not speak of these things here,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nwas but one of me. Think again and thou wilt remember. A boy\xe2\x80\x94a Hindu\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x94by the great green cannon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut was there not also an Englishman with a white beard holy among\r\nimages\xe2\x80\x94who himself made more sure my assurance of the River of the\r\nArrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x94went to the Ajaib-Gher in Lahore to pray before the Gods there,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nKim explained to the openly listening company. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Sahib of the\r\nWonder House talked to him\xe2\x80\x94yes, this is truth as a brother. He is a\r\nvery holy man, from far beyond the Hills. Rest, thou. In time we come\r\nto Umballa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my River\xe2\x80\x94the River of my healing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, if it please thee, we will go hunting for that River on\r\nfoot. So that we miss nothing\xe2\x80\x94not even a little rivulet in a\r\nfield-side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou hast a Search of thine own?\xe2\x80\x9d The lama\xe2\x80\x94very pleased that he\r\nremembered so well\xe2\x80\x94sat bolt upright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, humouring him. The boy was entirely happy to be out\r\nchewing _pan_ and seeing new people in the great good-tempered world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a bull\xe2\x80\x94a Red Bull that shall come and help thee and carry\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94whither? I have forgotten. A Red Bull on a green field, was it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, it will carry me nowhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is but a tale I told\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d The cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife leaned forward, her bracelets\r\nclinking on her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cDo ye both dream dreams? A Red Bull on a green\r\nfield, that shall carry thee to the heavens or what? Was it a vision?\r\nDid one make a prophecy? _We_ have a Red Bull in our village behind\r\nJullundur city, and he grazes by choice in the very greenest of our\r\nfields!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive a woman an old wife\xe2\x80\x99s tale and a weaver-bird a leaf and a\r\nthread\xe2\x80\x9d, they will weave wonderful things,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sikh. \xe2\x80\x9cAll holy\r\nmen dream dreams, and by following holy men their disciples attain that\r\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Red Bull on a green field, was it?\xe2\x80\x9d the lama repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a former\r\nlife it may be thou hast acquired merit, and the Bull will come to\r\nreward thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay\xe2\x80\x94nay\xe2\x80\x94it was but a tale one told to me\xe2\x80\x94for a jest belike. But I will\r\nseek the Bull about Umballa, and thou canst look for thy River and rest\r\nfrom the clatter of the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that the Bull knows\xe2\x80\x94that he is sent to guide us both.\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe lama, hopefully as a child. Then to the company, indicating Kim:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one was sent to me but yesterday. He is not, I think, of this\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeggars aplenty have I met, and holy men to boot, but never such a\r\n_yogi_ nor such a disciple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\nHer husband touched his forehead lightly with one finger and smiled.\r\nBut the next time the lama would eat they took care to give him of\r\ntheir best.\r\n\r\nAnd at last\xe2\x80\x94tired, sleepy, and dusty\xe2\x80\x94they reached Umballa City Station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe abide here upon a law-suit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife to Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nlodge with my man\xe2\x80\x99s cousin\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother. There is room also in the\r\ncourtyard for thy _yogi_ and for thee. Will\xe2\x80\x94will he give me a\r\nblessing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO holy man! A woman with a heart of gold gives us lodging for the\r\nnight. It is a kindly land, this land of the South. See how we have\r\nbeen helped since the dawn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama bowed his head in benediction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo fill my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother\xe2\x80\x99s house with wastrels\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nhusband began, as he shouldered his heavy bamboo staff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy cousin\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother owes my father\xe2\x80\x99s cousin something yet on\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x99s marriage-feast,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman crisply. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him put\r\ntheir food to that account. The _yogi_ will beg, I doubt not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I beg for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, anxious only to get the lama under\r\nshelter for the night, that he might seek Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s Englishman and\r\ndeliver himself of the white stallion\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when the lama had come to an anchor in the inner\r\ncourtyard of a decent Hindu house behind the cantonments, \xe2\x80\x9cI go away\r\nfor a while\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94to buy us victual in the bazar. Do not stray abroad till\r\nI return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt return? Thou wilt surely return?\xe2\x80\x9d The old man caught at his\r\nwrist. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou wilt return in this very same shape? Is it too late to\r\nlook tonight for the River?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late and too dark. Be comforted. Think how far thou art on the\r\nroad\xe2\x80\x94an hundred _kos_ from Lahore already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea\xe2\x80\x94and farther from my monastery. Alas! It is a great and terrible\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim stole out and away, as unremarkable a figure as ever carried his\r\nown and a few score thousand other folk\xe2\x80\x99s fate slung round his neck.\r\nMahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s directions left him little doubt of the house in which his\r\nEnglishman lived; and a groom, bringing a dog-cart home from the Club,\r\nmade him quite sure. It remained only to identify his man, and Kim\r\nslipped through the garden hedge and hid in a clump of plumed grass\r\nclose to the veranda. The house blazed with lights, and servants moved\r\nabout tables dressed with flowers, glass, and silver. Presently forth\r\ncame an Englishman, dressed in black and white, humming a tune. It was\r\ntoo dark to see his face, so Kim, beggar-wise, tried an old experiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProtector of the Poor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man backed towards the voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMahbub Ali says\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah! What says Mahbub Ali?\xe2\x80\x9d He made no attempt to look for the\r\nspeaker, and that showed Kim that he knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proof is there?\xe2\x80\x9d The Englishman switched at the rose-hedge in the\r\nside of the drive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMahbub Ali has given me this proof.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim flipped the wad of folded\r\npaper into the air, and it fell in the path beside the man, who put his\r\nfoot on it as a gardener came round the corner. When the servant passed\r\nhe picked it up, dropped a rupee\xe2\x80\x94Kim could hear the clink\xe2\x80\x94and strode\r\ninto the house, never turning round. Swiftly Kim took up the money; but\r\nfor all his training, he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver the\r\nleast part of any game. What he desired was the visible effect of\r\naction; so, instead of slinking away, he lay close in the grass and\r\nwormed nearer to the house.\r\n\r\nHe saw\xe2\x80\x94Indian bungalows are open through and through\xe2\x80\x94the Englishman\r\nreturn to a small dressing-room, in a comer of the veranda, that was\r\nhalf office, littered with papers and despatch-boxes, and sit down to\r\nstudy Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s message. His face, by the full ray of the kerosene\r\nlamp, changed and darkened, and Kim, used as every beggar must be to\r\nwatching countenances, took good note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill! Will, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d called a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be in the\r\ndrawing-room. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be here in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man still read intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill!\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice, five minutes later. \xe2\x80\x9c_He\xe2\x80\x99s_ come. I can hear\r\nthe troopers in the drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four native troopers\r\nbehind it halted at the veranda, and a tall, black haired man, erect as\r\nan arrow, swung out, preceded by a young officer who laughed\r\npleasantly.\r\n\r\nFlat on his belly lay Kim, almost touching the high wheels. His man and\r\nthe black stranger exchanged two sentences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young officer promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything waits\r\nwhile a horse is concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shan\xe2\x80\x99t be more than twenty minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim\xe2\x80\x99s man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can do\r\nthe honours\xe2\x80\x94keep \xe2\x80\x99em amused, and all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell one of the troopers to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall man, and they both\r\npassed into the dressing-room together as the landau rolled away. Kim\r\nsaw their heads bent over Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s message, and heard the\r\nvoices\xe2\x80\x94one low and deferential, the other sharp and decisive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a question of weeks. It is a question of days\xe2\x80\x94hours almost,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the elder. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d been expecting it for some time, but this\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ntapped Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s paper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cclinches it. Grogan\xe2\x80\x99s dining here to-night,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, and Macklin too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to them myself. The matter will be referred to\r\nthe Council, of course, but this is a case where one is justified in\r\nassuming that we take action at once. Warn the Pined and Peshawar\r\nbrigades. It will disorganize all the summer reliefs, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nthat. This comes of not smashing them thoroughly the first time. Eight\r\nthousand should be enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about artillery, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must consult Macklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it means war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Punishment. When a man is bound by the action of his predecessor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut C25 may have lied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe bears out the other\xe2\x80\x99s information. Practically, they showed their\r\nhand six months back. But Devenish would have it there was a chance of\r\npeace. Of course they used it to make themselves stronger. Send off\r\nthose telegrams at once\xe2\x80\x94the new code, not the old\xe2\x80\x94mine and Wharton\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think we need keep the ladies waiting any longer. We can settle\r\nthe rest over the cigars. I thought it was coming. It\xe2\x80\x99s punishment\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nwar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the trooper cantered off, Kim crawled round to the back of the\r\nhouse, where, going on his Lahore experiences, he judged there would be\r\nfood\xe2\x80\x94and information. The kitchen was crowded with excited scullions,\r\none of whom kicked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, feigning tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI came only to wash dishes in return\r\nfor a bellyful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll Umballa is on the same errand. Get hence. They go in now with the\r\nsoup. Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib need strange\r\nscullions to help us through a big dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very big dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, looking at the plates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmall wonder. The guest of honour is none other than the Jang-i-Lat\r\nSahib [the Commander-in-Chief].\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, with the correct guttural note of wonder. He had\r\nlearned what he wanted, and when the scullion turned he was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all that trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, thinking as usual in\r\nHindustani, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a horse\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree! Mahbub Ali should have come to me\r\nto learn a little lying. Every time before that I have borne a message\r\nit concerned a woman. Now it is men. Better. The tall man said that\r\nthey will loose a great army to punish someone\xe2\x80\x94somewhere\xe2\x80\x94the news goes\r\nto Pindi and Peshawur. There are also guns. Would I had crept nearer.\r\nIt is big news!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned to find the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s cousin\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother\r\ndiscussing the family law-suit in all its bearings with the cultivator\r\nand his wife and a few friends, while the lama dozed. After the evening\r\nmeal some one passed him a water-pipe; and Kim felt very much of a man\r\nas he pulled at the smooth coconut-shell, his legs spread abroad in the\r\nmoonlight, his tongue clicking in remarks from time to time. His hosts\r\nwere most polite; for the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife had told them of his vision\r\nof the Red Bull, and of his probable descent from another world.\r\nMoreover, the lama was a great and venerable curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe family priest, an old, tolerant Sarsut Brahmin, dropped in later,\r\nand naturally started a theological argument to impress the family. By\r\ncreed, of course, they were all on their priest\xe2\x80\x99s side, but the lama\r\nwas the guest and the novelty. His gentle kindliness, and his\r\nimpressive Chinese quotations, that sounded like spells, delighted them\r\nhugely; and in this sympathetic, simple air, he expanded like the\r\nBodhisat\xe2\x80\x99s own lotus, speaking of his life in the great hills of\r\nSuch-zen, before, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI rose up to seek enlightenment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen it came out that in those worldly days he had been a master-hand\r\nat casting horoscopes and nativities; and the family priest led him on\r\nto describe his methods; each giving the planets names that the other\r\ncould not understand, and pointing upwards as the big stars sailed\r\nacross the dark. The children of the house tugged unrebuked at his\r\nrosary; and he clean forgot the Rule which forbids looking at women as\r\nhe talked of enduring snows, landslips, blocked passes, the remote\r\ncliffs where men find sapphires and turquoise, and that wonderful\r\nupland road that leads at last into Great China itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow thinkest thou of this one?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cultivator aside to the\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA holy man\xe2\x80\x94a holy man indeed. His Gods are not the Gods, but his feet\r\nare upon the Way,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd his methods of nativities,\r\nthough that is beyond thee, are wise and sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim lazily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I find my Red Bull on a green\r\nfield, as was promised me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat knowledge hast thou of thy birth-hour?\xe2\x80\x9d the priest asked,\r\nswelling with importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween first and second cockcrow of the first night in May.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know; but upon the hour that I cried first fell the great\r\nearthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir.\xe2\x80\x9d This Kim had from the\r\nwoman who took care of him, and she again from Kimball O\xe2\x80\x99Hara. The\r\nearthquake had been felt in India, and for long stood a leading date in\r\nthe Punjab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAi!\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman excitedly. This seemed to make Kim\xe2\x80\x99s supernatural\r\norigin more certain. \xe2\x80\x9cWas not such an one\xe2\x80\x99s daughter born then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd her mother bore her husband four sons in four years all likely\r\nboys,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, sitting outside the circle in the\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone reared in the knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the family priest, \xe2\x80\x9cforget how the\r\nplanets stood in their Houses upon that night.\xe2\x80\x9d He began to draw in the\r\ndust of the courtyard. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least thou hast good claim to a half of the\r\nHouse of the Bull. How runs thy prophecy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon a day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, delighted at the sensation he was creating, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall be made great by means of a Red Bull on a green field, but first\r\nthere will enter two men making all things ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: thus ever at the opening of a vision. A thick darkness that\r\nclears slowly; anon one enters with a broom making ready the place.\r\nThen begins the Sight. Two men\xe2\x80\x94thou sayest? Ay, ay. The Sun, leaving\r\nthe House of the Bull, enters that of the Twins. Hence the two men of\r\nthe prophecy. Let us now consider. Fetch me a twig, little one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knitted his brows, scratched, smoothed out, and scratched again in\r\nthe dust mysterious signs\xe2\x80\x94to the wonder of all save the lama, who, with\r\nfine instinct, forbore to interfere.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour, he tossed the twig from him with a grunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm! Thus say the stars. Within three days come the two men to make all\r\nthings ready. After them follows the Bull; but the sign over against\r\nhim is the sign of War and armed men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was indeed a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the carriage from\r\nLahore,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cultivator\xe2\x80\x99s wife hopefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTck! Armed men\xe2\x80\x94many hundreds. What concern hast thou with war?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe priest to Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cThine is a red and an angry sign of War to be\r\nloosed very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone\xe2\x80\x94none.\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe seek only peace and our\r\nRiver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim smiled, remembering what he had overheard in the dressing-room.\r\nDecidedly he was a favourite of the stars.\r\n\r\nThe priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than this I\r\ncannot see. In three days comes the Bull to thee, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my River, my River,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped his Bull would\r\nlead us both to the River.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, for that wondrous River, my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d the priest replied. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch\r\nthings are not common.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext morning, though they were pressed to stay, the lama insisted on\r\ndeparture. They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and nearly three\r\nannas in copper money for the needs of the road, and with many\r\nblessings watched the two go southward in the dawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity it is that these and such as these could not be freed from\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, then would only evil people be left on the earth, and who would\r\ngive us meat and shelter?\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Kim, stepping merrily under his\r\nburden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder is a small stream. Let us look,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, and he led from\r\nthe white road across the fields; walking into a very hornets\xe2\x80\x99 nest of\r\npariah dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nYea, voice of every Soul that clung\r\nTo life that strove from rung to rung\r\nWhen Devadatta\xe2\x80\x99s rule was young,\r\n    The warm wind brings Kamakura.\r\n\r\nBehind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole. He was a\r\nmarket-gardener, Arain by caste, growing vegetables and flowers for\r\nUmballa city, and well Kim knew the breed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch an one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, disregarding the dogs, \xe2\x80\x9cis impolite to\r\nstrangers, intemperate of speech and uncharitable. Be warned by his\r\ndemeanour, my disciple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, shameless beggars!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the farmer. \xe2\x80\x9cBegone! Get hence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe go,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama returned, with quiet dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cWe go from these\r\nunblessed fields.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, sucking in his breath. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the next crops fail, thou\r\ncanst only blame thine own tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man shuffled uneasily in his slippers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe land is full of\r\nbeggars,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, half apologetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee, O Mali?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Kim tartly, using the name that a market-gardener least likes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll we sought was to look at that river beyond the field there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRiver, forsooth!\xe2\x80\x9d the man snorted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat city do ye hail from not to\r\nknow a canal-cut? It runs as straight as an arrow, and I pay for the\r\nwater as though it were molten silver. There is a branch of a river\r\nbeyond. But if ye need water I can give that\xe2\x80\x94and milk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, we will go to the river,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, striding out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMilk and a meal.\xe2\x80\x9d the man stammered, as he looked at the strange tall\r\nfigure. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I would not draw evil upon myself\xe2\x80\x94or my crops. But beggars\r\nare so many in these hard days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake notice.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama turned to Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was led to speak harshly by\r\nthe Red Mist of anger. That clearing from his eyes, he becomes\r\ncourteous and of an affable heart. May his fields be blessed! Beware\r\nnot to judge men too hastily, O farmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to\r\nbyre,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim to the abashed man. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he not wise and holy? I am his\r\ndisciple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow\r\nfield-borders with great dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no pride,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no pride\r\namong such as follow the Middle Way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLow-caste I did not say, for how can that be which is not? Afterwards\r\nhe amended his discourtesy, and I forgot the offence. Moreover, he is\r\nas we are, bound upon the Wheel of Things; but he does not tread the\r\nway of deliverance.\xe2\x80\x9d He halted at a little runlet among the fields, and\r\nconsidered the hoof-pitted bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, how wilt thou know thy River?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, squatting in the shade\r\nof some tall sugar-cane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I find it, an enlightenment will surely be given. This, I feel,\r\nis not the place. O littlest among the waters, if only thou couldst\r\ntell me where runs my River! But be thou blessed to make the fields\r\nbear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! Look!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim sprang to his side and dragged him back. A\r\nyellow-and-brown streak glided from the purple rustling stems to the\r\nbank, stretched its neck to the water, drank, and lay still\xe2\x80\x94a big cobra\r\nwith fixed, lidless eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no stick\xe2\x80\x94I have no stick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cI will get me one and\r\nbreak his back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? He is upon the Wheel as we are\xe2\x80\x94a life ascending or\r\ndescending\xe2\x80\x94very far from deliverance. Great evil must the soul have\r\ndone that is cast into this shape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate all snakes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. No native training can quench the white\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s horror of the Serpent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him live out his life.\xe2\x80\x9d The coiled thing hissed and half opened\r\nits hood. \xe2\x80\x9cMay thy release come soon, brother!\xe2\x80\x9d the lama continued\r\nplacidly. \xe2\x80\x9cHast _thou_ knowledge, by chance, of my River?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever have I seen such a man as thou art,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim whispered, overwhelmed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo the very snakes understand thy talk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d He passed within a foot of the cobra\xe2\x80\x99s poised head. It\r\nflattened itself among the dusty coils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, thou!\xe2\x80\x9d he called over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cI go round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome. He does no hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim hesitated for a moment. The lama backed his order by some droned\r\nChinese quotation which Kim took for a charm. He obeyed and bounded\r\nacross the rivulet, and the snake, indeed, made no sign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever have I seen such a man.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim wiped the sweat from his forehead.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, whither go we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is for thee to say. I am old, and a stranger\xe2\x80\x94far from my own\r\nplace. But that the _r\xc3\xaal_-carriage fills my head with noises of\r\ndevil-drums I would go in it to Benares now ... Yet by so going we may\r\nmiss the River. Let us find another river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhere the hard-worked soil gives three and even four crops a year\r\nthrough patches of sugar-cane, tobacco, long white radishes, and\r\nnol-kol, all that day they strolled on, turning aside to every glimpse\r\nof water; rousing village dogs and sleeping villages at noonday; the\r\nlama replying to the volleyed questions with an unswerving simplicity.\r\nThey sought a River: a River of miraculous healing. Had any one\r\nknowledge of such a stream?\r\n\r\nSometimes men laughed, but more often heard the story out to the end\r\nand offered them a place in the shade, a drink of milk, and a meal. The\r\nwomen were always kind, and the little children as children are the\r\nworld over, alternately shy and venturesome.\r\n\r\nEvening found them at rest under the village tree of a mud-walled,\r\nmud-roofed hamlet, talking to the headman as the cattle came in from\r\nthe grazing-grounds and the women prepared the day\xe2\x80\x99s last meal. They\r\nhad passed beyond the belt of market-gardens round hungry Umballa, and\r\nwere among the mile-wide green of the staple crops.\r\n\r\nHe was a white-bearded and affable elder, used to entertaining\r\nstrangers. He dragged out a string bedstead for the lama, set warm\r\ncooked food before him, prepared him a pipe, and, the evening\r\nceremonies being finished in the village temple, sent for the village\r\npriest.\r\n\r\nKim told the older children tales of the size and beauty of Lahore, of\r\nrailway travel, and such-like city things, while the men talked, slowly\r\nas their cattle chew the cud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot fathom it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the headman at last to the priest. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nreadest thou this talk?\xe2\x80\x9d The lama, his tale told, was silently telling\r\nhis beads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Seeker.\xe2\x80\x9d the priest answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe land is full of such.\r\nRemember him who came only last, month\xe2\x80\x94the _faquir_ with the tortoise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but that man had right and reason, for Krishna Himself appeared in\r\na vision promising him Paradise without the burning-pyre if he\r\njourneyed to Prayag. This man seeks no God who is within my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, he is old: he comes from far off, and he is mad,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nsmooth-shaven priest replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHear me.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cThree\r\n_kos_ (six miles) to the westward runs the great road to Calcutta.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I would go to Benares\xe2\x80\x94to Benares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to Benares also. It crosses all streams on this side of Hind. Now\r\nmy word to thee, Holy One, is rest here till tomorrow. Then take the\r\nroad\xe2\x80\x9d (it was the Grand Trunk Road he meant) \xe2\x80\x9cand test each stream that\r\nit overpasses; for, as I understand, the virtue of thy River lies\r\nneither in one pool nor place, but throughout its length. Then, if thy\r\nGods will, be assured that thou wilt come upon thy freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well said.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama was much impressed by the plan. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will\r\nbegin tomorrow, and a blessing on thee for showing old feet such a near\r\nroad.\xe2\x80\x9d A deep, sing-song Chinese half-chant closed the sentence. Even\r\nthe priest was impressed, and the headman feared an evil spell: but\r\nnone could look at the lama\xe2\x80\x99s simple, eager face and doubt him long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeest thou my _chela?_\xe2\x80\x9d he said, diving into his snuff-gourd with an\r\nimportant sniff. It was his duty to repay courtesy with courtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94and hear.\xe2\x80\x9d The headman rolled his eye where Kim was chatting to\r\na girl in blue as she laid crackling thorns on a fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe also has a Search of his own. No river, but a Bull. Yea, a Red Bull\r\non a green field will some day raise him to honour. He is, I think, not\r\naltogether of this world. He was sent of a sudden to aid me in this\r\nsearch, and his name is Friend of all the World.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cHo, there, Friend of all the World,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried\r\nacross the sharp-smelling smoke, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Holy One\xe2\x80\x99s disciple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says thou are a _b\xc5\xabt_ (a spirit).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan _b\xc5\xabts_ eat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, with a twinkle. \xe2\x80\x9cFor I am hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no jest,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cA certain astrologer of that city\r\nwhose name I have forgotten\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no more than the city of Umballa where we slept last night,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nKim whispered to the priest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Umballa was it? He cast a horoscope and declared that my _chela_\r\nshould find his desire within two days. But what said he of the meaning\r\nof the stars, Friend of all the World?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim cleared his throat and looked around at the village greybeards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe meaning of my Star is War,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied pompously.\r\n\r\nSomebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on the\r\nbrickwork plinth under the great tree. Where a native would have lain\r\ndown, Kim\xe2\x80\x99s white blood set him upon his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, War,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a sure prophecy,\xe2\x80\x9d rumbled a deep voice. \xe2\x80\x9cFor there is always\r\nwar along the Border\xe2\x80\x94as I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an old, withered man, who had served the Government in the days\r\nof the Mutiny as a native officer in a newly raised cavalry regiment.\r\nThe Government had given him a good holding in the village, and though\r\nthe demands of his sons, now grey-bearded officers on their own\r\naccount, had impoverished him, he was still a person of consequence.\r\nEnglish officials\xe2\x80\x94Deputy Commissioners even\xe2\x80\x94turned aside from the main\r\nroad to visit him, and on those occasions he dressed himself in the\r\nuniform of ancient days, and stood up like a ramrod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this shall be a great war\xe2\x80\x94a war of eight thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nshrilled across the quick-gathering crowd, astonishing himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRedcoats or our own regiments?\xe2\x80\x9d the old man snapped, as though he were\r\nasking an equal. His tone made men respect Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRedcoats,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim at a venture. \xe2\x80\x9cRedcoats and guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but the astrologer said no word of this,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lama, snuffing\r\nprodigiously in his excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ know. The word has come to me, who am this Holy One\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisciple. There will rise a war\xe2\x80\x94a war of eight thousand redcoats. From\r\nPindi and Peshawur they will be drawn. This is sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy has heard bazar-talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the priest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he was always by my side,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should he know? I\r\ndid not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will make a clever juggler when the old man is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the\r\npriest to the headman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat new trick is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sign. Give me a sign,\xe2\x80\x9d thundered the old soldier suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\r\nwere war my sons would have told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen all is ready, thy sons, doubt not, will be told. But it is a long\r\nroad from thy sons to the man in whose hands these things lie.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\r\nwarmed to the game, for it reminded him of experiences in the\r\nletter-carrying line, when, for the sake of a few pice, he pretended to\r\nknow more than he knew. But now he was playing for larger things\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsheer excitement and the sense of power. He drew a new breath and went\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld man, give _me_ a sign. Do underlings order the goings of eight\r\nthousand redcoats\xe2\x80\x94with guns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d Still the old man answered as though Kim were an equal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost thou know who He is, then, that gives the order?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen Him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo know again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have known Him since he was a lieutenant in the _top-khana_ (the\r\nArtillery).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tall man. A tall man with black hair, walking thus?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim took a few\r\npaces in a stiff, wooden style.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy. But that anyone may have seen.\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd were breathless\xe2\x80\x94still\r\nthrough all this talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will say more. Look now. First the\r\ngreat man walks thus. Then He thinks thus.\xe2\x80\x9d (Kim drew a forefinger over\r\nhis forehead and downwards till it came to rest by the angle of the\r\njaw.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnon He twitches his fingers thus. Anon He thrusts his hat under\r\nhis left armpit.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim illustrated the motion and stood like a stork.\r\n\r\nThe old man groaned, inarticulate with amazement; and the crowd\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94so. But what does He when He is about to give an order?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rubs the skin at the back of his neck\xe2\x80\x94thus. Then falls one finger\r\non the table and He makes a small sniffing noise through his nose. Then\r\nHe speaks, saying: \xe2\x80\x98Loose such and such a regiment. Call out such\r\nguns.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man rose stiffly and saluted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim translated into the vernacular the clinching sentences he\r\nhad heard in the dressing-room at Umballa\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For,\xe2\x80\x99 says He, \xe2\x80\x98we should\r\nhave done this long ago. It is not war\xe2\x80\x94it is a chastisement. Snff!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough. I believe. I have seen Him thus in the smoke of battles. Seen\r\nand heard. It is He!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw no smoke\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim\xe2\x80\x99s voice shifted to the rapt sing-song of the\r\nwayside fortune-teller. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw this in darkness. First came a man to\r\nmake things clear. Then came horsemen. Then came He standing in a ring\r\nof light. The rest followed as I have said. Old man, have I spoken\r\ntruth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is He. Past all doubt it is He.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd drew a long, quavering breath, staring alternately at the old\r\nman, still at attention, and ragged Kim against the purple twilight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid I not\xe2\x80\x94said I not he was from the other world?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lama\r\nproudly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the Friend of all the World. He is the Friend of the\r\nStars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least it does not concern us,\xe2\x80\x9d a man cried. \xe2\x80\x9cO thou young\r\nsoothsayer, if the gift abides with thee at all seasons, I have a\r\nred-spotted cow. She may be sister to thy Bull for aught I know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr I care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Stars do not concern themselves with thy\r\ncattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but she is very sick,\xe2\x80\x9d a woman struck in. \xe2\x80\x9cMy man is a buffalo,\r\nor he would have chosen his words better. Tell me if she recover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad Kim been at all an ordinary boy, he would have carried on the play;\r\nbut one does not know Lahore city, and least of all the _faquirs_ by\r\nthe Taksali Gate, for thirteen years without also knowing human nature.\r\n\r\nThe priest looked at him sideways, something bitterly\xe2\x80\x94a dry and\r\nblighting smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no priest, then, in the village? I thought I had seen a great\r\none even now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the woman began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou and thy husband hoped to get the cow cured for a handful of\r\nthanks.\xe2\x80\x9d The shot told: they were notoriously the closest-fisted couple\r\nin the village. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not well to cheat the temples. Give a young calf\r\nto thine own priest, and, unless thy Gods are angry past recall, she\r\nwill give milk within a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA master-beggar art thou,\xe2\x80\x9d purred the priest approvingly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot the\r\ncunning of forty years could have done better. Surely thou hast made\r\nthe old man rich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little flour, a little butter and a mouthful of cardamoms,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\r\nretorted, flushed with the praise, but still cautious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDoes one grow\r\nrich on that? And, as thou canst see, he is mad. But it serves me while\r\nI learn the road at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew what the _faquirs_ of the Taksali Gate were like when they\r\ntalked among themselves, and copied the very inflection of their lewd\r\ndisciples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs his Search, then, truth or a cloak to other ends? It may be\r\ntreasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is mad\xe2\x80\x94many times mad. There is nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the old soldier bobbled up and asked if Kim would accept his\r\nhospitality for the night. The priest recommended him to do so, but\r\ninsisted that the honour of entertaining the lama belonged to the\r\ntemple\xe2\x80\x94at which the lama smiled guilelessly. Kim glanced from one face\r\nto the other, and drew his own conclusions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the money?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, beckoning the old man off into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my bosom. Where else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it me. Quietly and swiftly give it me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why? Here is no ticket to buy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I thy _chela_, or am I not? Do I not safeguard thy old feet about\r\nthe ways? Give me the money and at dawn I will return it.\xe2\x80\x9d He slipped\r\nhis hand above the lama\xe2\x80\x99s girdle and brought away the purse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so\xe2\x80\x94be it so.\xe2\x80\x9d The old man nodded his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a great and\r\nterrible world. I never knew there were so many men alive in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext morning the priest was in a very bad temper, but the lama was\r\nquite happy; and Kim had enjoyed a most interesting evening with the\r\nold man, who brought out his cavalry sabre and, balancing it on his dry\r\nknees, told tales of the Mutiny and young captains thirty years in\r\ntheir graves, till Kim dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly the air of this country is good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cI sleep\r\nlightly, as do all old men; but last night I slept unwaking till broad\r\nday. Even now I am heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink a draught of hot milk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, who had carried not a few such\r\nremedies to opium-smokers of his acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time to take the\r\nRoad again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama\r\ngaily. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go. But how thinkest thou, _chela_, to recompense these\r\npeople, and especially the priest, for their great kindness? Truly they\r\nare _b\xc5\xabt-parast_, but in other lives, maybe, they will receive\r\nenlightenment. A rupee to the temple? The thing within is no more than\r\nstone and red paint, but the heart of man we must acknowledge when and\r\nwhere it is good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly One, hast thou ever taken the Road alone?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim looked up sharply,\r\nlike the Indian crows so busy about the fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, child: from Kulu to Path\xc3\xa2nkot\xe2\x80\x94from Kulu, where my first\r\n_chela_ died. When men were kind to us we made offerings, and all men\r\nwere well-disposed throughout all the Hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is otherwise in Hind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim drily. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir Gods are many-armed\r\nand malignant. Let them alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would set thee on thy road for a little, Friend of all the World,\r\nthou and thy yellow man.\xe2\x80\x9d The old soldier ambled up the village street,\r\nall shadowy in the dawn, on a punt, scissor-hocked pony. \xe2\x80\x9cLast night\r\nbroke up the fountains of remembrance in my so-dried heart, and it was\r\nas a blessing to me. Truly there is war abroad in the air. I smell it.\r\nSee! I have brought my sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat long-legged on the little beast, with the big sword at his\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94hand dropped on the pommel\xe2\x80\x94staring fiercely over the flat lands\r\ntowards the North. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me again how He showed in thy vision. Come up\r\nand sit behind me. The beast will carry two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am this Holy One\xe2\x80\x99s disciple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, as they cleared the\r\nvillage-gate. The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of them, but\r\nthe priest\xe2\x80\x99s farewell was cold and distant. He had wasted some opium on\r\na man who carried no money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well spoken. I am not much used to holy men, but respect is\r\nalways good. There is no respect in these days\xe2\x80\x94not even when a\r\nCommissioner Sahib comes to see me. But why should one whose Star leads\r\nhim to war follow a holy man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he _is_ a holy man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, and in talk\r\nand in act, holy. He is not like the others. I have never seen such an\r\none. We be not fortune-tellers, or jugglers, or beggars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art not. That I can see. But I do not know that other. He marches\r\nwell, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with long,\r\neasy, camel-like strides. He was deep in meditation, mechanically\r\nclicking his rosary.\r\n\r\nThey followed the rutted and worn country road that wound across the\r\nflat between the great dark-green mango-groves, the line of the\r\nsnowcapped Himalayas faint to the eastward. All India was at work in\r\nthe fields, to the creaking of well-wheels, the shouting of ploughmen\r\nbehind their cattle, and the clamour of the crows. Even the pony felt\r\nthe good influence and almost broke into a trot as Kim laid a hand on\r\nthe stirrup-leather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlama on the last bead of his eighty-one.\r\n\r\nThe old soldier growled in his beard, so that the lama for the first\r\ntime was aware of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeekest thou the River also?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day is new,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat need of a river save to water at\r\nbefore sundown? I come to show thee a short lane to the Big Road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a courtesy to be remembered, O man of good will. But why the\r\nsword?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in his game of\r\nmake-believe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sword,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fumbling it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that was a fancy of mine an old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s fancy. Truly the police orders are that no man must bear weapons\r\nthroughout Hind, but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he cheered up and slapped the hilt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call the\r\nconstabeels hereabout know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a good fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat profit to kill men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery little\xe2\x80\x94as I know; but if evil men were not now and then slain it\r\nwould not be a good world for weaponless dreamers. I do not speak\r\nwithout knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with\r\nblood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat madness was that, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gods, who sent it for a plague, alone know. A madness ate into all\r\nthe Army, and they turned against their officers. That was the first\r\nevil, but not past remedy if they had then held their hands. But they\r\nchose to kill the Sahibs\xe2\x80\x99 wives and children. Then came the Sahibs from\r\nover the sea and called them to most strict account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome such rumour, I believe, reached me once long ago. They called it\r\nthe Black Year, as I remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat manner of life hast thou led, not to know The Year? A rumour\r\nindeed! All earth knew, and trembled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur earth never shook but once\xe2\x80\x94upon the day that the Excellent One\r\nreceived Enlightenment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph! I saw Delhi shake at least\xe2\x80\x94and Delhi is the navel of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they turned against women and children? That was a bad deed, for\r\nwhich the punishment cannot be avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany strove to do so, but with very small profit. I was then in a\r\nregiment of cavalry. It broke. Of six hundred and eighty sabres stood\r\nfast to their salt\xe2\x80\x94how many, think you? Three. Of whom I was one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greater merit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerit! We did not consider it merit in those days. My people, my\r\nfriends, my brothers fell from me. They said: \xe2\x80\x98The time of the English\r\nis accomplished. Let each strike out a little holding for himself.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nI had talked with the men of Sobraon, of Chilianwallah, of Moodkee and\r\nFerozeshah. I said: \xe2\x80\x98Abide a little and the wind turns. There is no\r\nblessing in this work.\xe2\x80\x99 In those days I rode seventy miles with an\r\nEnglish Memsahib and her babe on my saddle-bow. (Wow! That was a horse\r\nfit for a man!) I placed them in safety, and back came I to my\r\nofficer\xe2\x80\x94the one that was not killed of our five. \xe2\x80\x98Give me work,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nI, \xe2\x80\x98for I am an outcast among my own kind, and my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s blood is wet\r\non my sabre.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Be content,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98There is great work forward. When\r\nthis madness is over there is a recompense.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, there is a recompense when the madness is over, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d the lama\r\nmuttered half to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident had\r\nheard a gun fired. No! In nineteen pitched battles was I; in\r\nsix-and-forty skirmishes of horse; and in small affairs without number.\r\nNine wounds I bear; a medal and four clasps and the medal of an Order,\r\nfor my captains, who are now generals, remembered me when the\r\nKaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years of her reign, and all the\r\nland rejoiced. They said: \xe2\x80\x98Give him the Order of Berittish India.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ncarry it upon my neck now. I have also my _jaghir_ (holding) from the\r\nhands of the State\xe2\x80\x94a free gift to me and mine. The men of the old\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x94they are now Commissioners\xe2\x80\x94come riding to me through the\r\ncrops\xe2\x80\x94high upon horses so that all the village sees\xe2\x80\x94and we talk out the\r\nold skirmishes, one dead man\xe2\x80\x99s name leading to another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, afterwards they go away, but not before my village has seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at the last what wilt thou do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the last I shall die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the Gods order it. I have never pestered Them with prayers. I do\r\nnot think They will pester me. Look you, I have noticed in my long life\r\nthat those who eternally break in upon Those Above with complaints and\r\nreports and bellowings and weepings are presently sent for in haste, as\r\nour Colonel used to send for slack-jawed down-country men who talked\r\ntoo much. No, I have never wearied the Gods. They will remember this,\r\nand give me a quiet place where I can drive my lance in the shade, and\r\nwait to welcome my sons: I have no less than three Rissaldar\xe2\x80\x94majors\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94in the regiments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they likewise, bound upon the Wheel, go forth from life to\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94from despair to despair,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama below his breath, \xe2\x80\x9chot,\r\nuneasy, snatching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d the old soldier chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cThree Rissaldar\xe2\x80\x94majors in three\r\nregiments. Gamblers a little, but so am I. They must be well mounted;\r\nand one cannot take the horses as in the old days one took women. Well,\r\nwell, my holding can pay for all. How thinkest thou? It is a\r\nwell-watered strip, but my men cheat me. I do not know how to ask save\r\nat the lance\xe2\x80\x99s point. Ugh! I grow angry and I curse them, and they\r\nfeign penitence, but behind my back I know they call me a toothless old\r\nape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou never desired any other thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94a thousand times! A straight back and a close-clinging knee\r\nonce more; a quick wrist and a keen eye; and the marrow that makes a\r\nman. Oh, the old days\xe2\x80\x94the good days of my strength!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat strength is weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has turned so; but fifty years since I could have proved it\r\notherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d the old soldier retorted, driving his stirrup-edge into the\r\npony\xe2\x80\x99s lean flank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know a River of great healing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have drank Gunga-water to the edge of dropsy. All she gave me was a\r\nflux, and no sort of strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not Gunga. The River that I know washes from all taint of sin.\r\nAscending the far bank one is assured of Freedom. I do not know thy\r\nlife, but thy face is the face of the honourable and courteous. Thou\r\nhast clung to thy Way, rendering fidelity when it was hard to give, in\r\nthat Black Year of which I now remember other tales. Enter now upon the\r\nMiddle Way which is the path to Freedom. Hear the Most Excellent Law,\r\nand do not follow dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, then, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d the soldier smiled, half saluting. \xe2\x80\x9cWe be all\r\nbabblers at our age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama squatted under the shade of a mango, whose shadow played\r\ncheckerwise over his face; the soldier sat stiffly on the pony; and\r\nKim, making sure that there were no snakes, lay down in the crotch of\r\nthe twisted roots.\r\n\r\nThere was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine, a cooing of\r\ndoves, and a sleepy drone of well-wheels across the fields. Slowly and\r\nimpressively the lama began. At the end of ten minutes the old soldier\r\nslid from his pony, to hear better as he said, and sat with the reins\r\nround his wrist. The lama\xe2\x80\x99s voice faltered, the periods lengthened. Kim\r\nwas busy watching a grey squirrel. When the little scolding bunch of\r\nfur, close pressed to the branch, disappeared, preacher and audience\r\nwere fast asleep, the old officer\xe2\x80\x99s strong-cut head pillowed on his\r\narm, the lama\xe2\x80\x99s thrown back against the tree-bole, where it showed like\r\nyellow ivory. A naked child toddled up, stared, and, moved by some\r\nquick impulse of reverence, made a solemn little obeisance before the\r\nlama\xe2\x80\x94only the child was so short and fat that it toppled over sideways,\r\nand Kim laughed at the sprawling, chubby legs. The child, scared and\r\nindignant, yelled aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHai! Hai!\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier, leaping to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What\r\norders? ... It is ... a child! I dreamed it was an alarm. Little\r\none\xe2\x80\x94little one\xe2\x80\x94do not cry. Have I slept? That was discourteous indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear! I am afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d roared the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it to fear? Two old men and a boy? How wilt thou ever make a\r\nsoldier, Princeling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama had waked too, but, taking no direct notice of the child,\r\nclicked his rosary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, stopping a yell midway. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never\r\nseen such things. Give them me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha.\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, smiling, and trailing a loop of it on the grass:\r\n\r\nThis is a handful of cardamoms, This is a lump of _ghi:_\r\nThis is millet and chillies and rice, A supper for thee and me!\r\n\r\nThe child shrieked with joy, and snatched at the dark, glancing beads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cWhence hadst thou that song, despiser of\r\nthis world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI learned it in Path\xc3\xa2nkot\xe2\x80\x94sitting on a doorstep,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama shyly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is good to be kind to babes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I remember, before the sleep came on us, thou hadst told me that\r\nmarriage and bearing were darkeners of the true light, stumbling-blocks\r\nupon the Way. Do children drop from Heaven in thy country? Is it the\r\nWay to sing them songs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo man is all perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama gravely, recoiling the rosary.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun now to thy mother, little one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier to Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is ashamed for that he has\r\nmade a child happy. There was a very good householder lost in thee, my\r\nbrother. Hai, child!\xe2\x80\x9d He threw it a pice. \xe2\x80\x9cSweetmeats are always\r\nsweet.\xe2\x80\x9d And as the little figure capered away into the sunshine: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\ngrow up and become men. Holy One, I grieve that I slept in the midst of\r\nthy preaching. Forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe be two old men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fault is mine. I listened to\r\nthy talk of the world and its madness, and one fault led to the next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him! What harm do thy Gods suffer from play with a babe? And that\r\nsong was very well sung. Let us go on and I will sing thee the song of\r\nNikal Seyn before Delhi\xe2\x80\x94the old song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they fared out from the gloom of the mango-tope, the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh, shrill voice ringing across the field, as wail by long-drawn wail\r\nhe unfolded the story of Nikal Seyn [Nicholson]\xe2\x80\x94the song that men sing\r\nin the Punjab to this day. Kim was delighted, and the lama listened\r\nwith deep interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ahi! Nikal Seyn is dead\xe2\x80\x94he died before Delhi! Lances of the North,\r\ntake vengeance for Nikal Seyn_.\xe2\x80\x9d He quavered it out to the end, marking\r\nthe trills with the flat of his sword on the pony\xe2\x80\x99s rump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now we come to the Big Road,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after receiving the\r\ncompliments of Kim; for the lama was markedly silent. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is long since\r\nI have ridden this way, but thy boy\xe2\x80\x99s talk stirred me. See, Holy\r\nOne\xe2\x80\x94the Great Road which is the backbone of all Hind. For the most part\r\nit is shaded, as here, with four lines of trees; the middle road\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nhard\xe2\x80\x94takes the quick traffic. In the days before rail-carriages the\r\nSahibs travelled up and down here in hundreds. Now there are only\r\ncountry-carts and such like. Left and right is the rougher road for the\r\nheavy carts\xe2\x80\x94grain and cotton and timber, fodder, lime and hides. A man\r\ngoes in safety here for at every few _kos_ is a police-station. The\r\npolice are thieves and extortioners (I myself would patrol it with\r\ncavalry\xe2\x80\x94young recruits under a strong captain), but at least they do\r\nnot suffer any rivals. All castes and kinds of men move here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! Brahmins and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias,\r\npilgrims and potters\xe2\x80\x94all the world going and coming. It is to me as a\r\nriver from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs\r\nstraight, bearing without crowding India\xe2\x80\x99s traffic for fifteen hundred\r\nmiles\xe2\x80\x94such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world. They\r\nlooked at the green-arched, shade-flecked length of it, the white\r\nbreadth speckled with slow-pacing folk; and the two-roomed\r\npolice-station opposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho bears arms against the law?\xe2\x80\x9d a constable called out laughingly, as\r\nhe caught sight of the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s sword. \xe2\x80\x9cAre not the police enough to\r\ndestroy evil-doers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because of the police I bought it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes all\r\ngo well in Hind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRissaldar Sahib, all goes well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am like an old tortoise, look you, who puts his head out from the\r\nbank and draws it in again. Ay, this is the Road of Hindustan. All men\r\ncome by this way...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSon of a swine, is the soft part of the road meant for thee to scratch\r\nthy back upon? Father of all the daughters of shame and husband of ten\r\nthousand virtueless ones, thy mother was devoted to a devil, being led\r\nthereto by her mother. Thy aunts have never had a nose for seven\r\ngenerations! Thy sister\xe2\x80\x94What Owl\xe2\x80\x99s folly told thee to draw thy carts\r\nacross the road? A broken wheel? Then take a broken head and put the\r\ntwo together at leisure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice and a venomous whip-cracking came out of a pillar of dust\r\nfifty yards away, where a cart had broken down. A thin, high Kathiawar\r\nmare, with eyes and nostrils aflame, rocketed out of the jam, snorting\r\nand wincing as her rider bent her across the road in chase of a\r\nshouting man. He was tall and grey-bearded, sitting the almost mad\r\nbeast as a piece of her, and scientifically lashing his victim between\r\nplunges.\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s face lit with pride. \xe2\x80\x9cMy child!\xe2\x80\x9d said he briefly, and\r\nstrove to rein the pony\xe2\x80\x99s neck to a fitting arch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to be beaten before the police?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the carter. \xe2\x80\x9cJustice! I\r\nwill have Justice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to be blocked by a shouting ape who upsets ten thousand sacks\r\nunder a young horse\xe2\x80\x99s nose? That is the way to ruin a mare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe speaks truth. He speaks truth. But she follows her man close,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe old man. The carter ran under the wheels of his cart and thence\r\nthreatened all sorts of vengeance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are strong men, thy sons,\xe2\x80\x9d said the policeman serenely, picking\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\nThe horseman delivered one last vicious cut with his whip and came on\r\nat a canter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father!\xe2\x80\x9d He reigned back ten yards and dismounted.\r\n\r\nThe old man was off his pony in an instant, and they embraced as do\r\nfather and son in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Luck, she is never a lady,\r\nBut the cursedest quean alive,\r\nTricksy, wincing, and jady\xe2\x80\x94\r\nKittle to lead or drive.\r\nGreet her\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s hailing a stranger!\r\nMeet her\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s busking to leave!\r\nLet her alone for a shrew to the bone\r\nAnd the hussy comes plucking your sleeve!\r\n    Largesse! Largesse, O Fortune!\r\n    Give or hold at your will.\r\n    If I\xe2\x80\x99ve no care for Fortune,\r\n    Fortune must follow me still!\r\n\r\n_The Wishing-Caps_.\r\n\r\nThen, lowering their voices, they spoke together. Kim came to rest\r\nunder a tree, but the lama tugged impatiently at his elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on. The River is not here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHai mai! Have we not walked enough for a little? Our River will not\r\nrun away. Patience, and he will give us a dole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis.\xe2\x80\x9d said the old soldier suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cis the Friend of the Stars. He\r\nbrought me the news yesterday. Having seen the very man Himself, in a\r\nvision, giving orders for the war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm!\xe2\x80\x9d said his son, all deep in his broad chest. \xe2\x80\x9cHe came by a\r\nbazar-rumour and made profit of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least he did not ride to me begging for a new\r\ncharger, and the Gods know how many rupees. Are thy brothers\xe2\x80\x99 regiments\r\nalso under orders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. I took leave and came swiftly to thee in case\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn case they ran before thee to beg. O gamblers and spendthrifts all!\r\nBut thou hast never yet ridden in a charge. A good horse is needed\r\nthere, truly. A good follower and a good pony also for the marching.\r\nLet us see\xe2\x80\x94let us see.\xe2\x80\x9d He thrummed on the pommel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no place to cast accounts in, my father. Let us go to thy\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least pay the boy, then: I have no pice with me, and he brought\r\nauspicious news. Ho! Friend of all the World, a war is toward as thou\r\nhast said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, as I know, _the_ war,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Kim composedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, fingering his beads, all eager for the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master does not trouble the Stars for hire. We brought the news\r\nbear witness, we brought the news, and now we go.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim half-crooked his\r\nhand at his side.\r\n\r\nThe son tossed a silver coin through the sunlight, grumbling something\r\nabout beggars and jugglers. It was a four-anna piece, and would feed\r\nthem well for days. The lama, seeing the flash of the metal, droned a\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo thy way, Friend of all the World,\xe2\x80\x9d piped the old soldier, wheeling\r\nhis scrawny mount. \xe2\x80\x9cFor once in all my days I have met a true\r\nprophet\xe2\x80\x94who was not in the Army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather and son swung round together: the old man sitting as erect as\r\nthe younger.\r\n\r\nA Punjabi constable in yellow linen trousers slouched across the road.\r\nHe had seen the money pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalt!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in impressive English. \xe2\x80\x9cKnow ye not that there is a\r\n_takkus_ of two annas a head, which is four annas, on those who enter\r\nthe Road from this side-road? It is the order of the Sirkar, and the\r\nmoney is spent for the planting of trees and the beautification of the\r\nways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the bellies of the police,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, slipping out of arm\xe2\x80\x99s reach.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider for a while, man with a mud head. Think you we came from the\r\nnearest pond like the frog, thy father-in-law? Hast thou ever heard the\r\nname of thy brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who was he? Leave the boy alone,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a senior constable,\r\nimmensely delighted, as he squatted down to smoke his pipe in the\r\nveranda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took a label from a bottle of _belaitee-pani_ (soda-water), and,\r\naffixing it to a bridge, collected taxes for a month from those who\r\npassed, saying that it was the Sirkar\xe2\x80\x99s order. Then came an Englishman\r\nand broke his head. Ah, brother, I am a town-crow, not a village-crow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe policeman drew back abashed, and Kim hooted at him all down the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there ever such a disciple as I?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried merrily to the lama.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll earth would have picked thy bones within ten mile of Lahore city\r\nif I had not guarded thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consider in my own mind whether thou art a spirit, sometimes, or\r\nsometimes an evil imp,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, smiling slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thy _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim dropped into step at his side\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nindescribable gait of the long-distance tramp all the world over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let us walk,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the lama, and to the click of his rosary\r\nthey walked in silence mile upon mile. The lama as usual, was deep in\r\nmeditation, but Kim\xe2\x80\x99s bright eyes were open wide. This broad, smiling\r\nriver of life, he considered, was a vast improvement on the cramped and\r\ncrowded Lahore streets. There were new people and new sights at every\r\nstride\xe2\x80\x94castes he knew and castes that were altogether out of his\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThey met a troop of long-haired, strong-scented Sansis with baskets of\r\nlizards and other unclean food on their backs, their lean dogs sniffing\r\nat their heels. These people kept their own side of the road, moving at\r\na quick, furtive jog-trot, and all other castes gave them ample room;\r\nfor the Sansi is deep pollution. Behind them, walking wide and stiffly\r\nacross the strong shadows, the memory of his leg-irons still on him,\r\nstrode one newly released from the jail; his full stomach and shiny\r\nskin to prove that the Government fed its prisoners better than most\r\nhonest men could feed themselves. Kim knew that walk well, and made\r\nbroad jest of it as they passed. Then an Akali, a wild-eyed,\r\nwild-haired Sikh devotee in the blue-checked clothes of his faith, with\r\npolished-steel quoits glistening on the cone of his tall blue turban,\r\nstalked past, returning from a visit to one of the independent Sikh\r\nStates, where he had been singing the ancient glories of the Khalsa to\r\nCollege-trained princelings in top-boots and white-cord breeches. Kim\r\nwas careful not to irritate that man; for the Akali\xe2\x80\x99s temper is short\r\nand his arm quick. Here and there they met or were overtaken by the\r\ngaily dressed crowds of whole villages turning out to some local fair;\r\nthe women, with their babes on their hips, walking behind the men, the\r\nolder boys prancing on sticks of sugar-cane, dragging rude brass models\r\nof locomotives such as they sell for a halfpenny, or flashing the sun\r\ninto the eyes of their betters from cheap toy mirrors. One could see at\r\na glance what each had bought; and if there were any doubt it needed\r\nonly to watch the wives comparing, brown arm against brown arm, the\r\nnewly purchased dull glass bracelets that come from the North-West.\r\nThese merry-makers stepped slowly, calling one to the other and\r\nstopping to haggle with sweetmeat-sellers, or to make a prayer before\r\none of the wayside shrines\xe2\x80\x94sometimes Hindu, sometimes Mussalman\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nthe low-caste of both creeds share with beautiful impartiality. A solid\r\nline of blue, rising and falling like the back of a caterpillar in\r\nhaste, would swing up through the quivering dust and trot past to a\r\nchorus of quick cackling. That was a gang of _changars_\xe2\x80\x94the women who\r\nhave taken all the embankments of all the Northern railways under their\r\ncharge\xe2\x80\x94a flat-footed, big-bosomed, strong-limbed, blue-petticoated clan\r\nof earth-carriers, hurrying north on news of a job, and wasting no time\r\nby the road. They belong to the caste whose men do not count, and they\r\nwalked with squared elbows, swinging hips, and heads on high, as suits\r\nwomen who carry heavy weights. A little later a marriage procession\r\nwould strike into the Grand Trunk with music and shoutings, and a smell\r\nof marigold and jasmine stronger even than the reek of the dust. One\r\ncould see the bride\xe2\x80\x99s litter, a blur of red and tinsel, staggering\r\nthrough the haze, while the bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s bewreathed pony turned aside\r\nto snatch a mouthful from a passing fodder-cart. Then Kim would join\r\nthe Kentish-fire of good wishes and bad jokes, wishing the couple a\r\nhundred sons and no daughters, as the saying is. Still more interesting\r\nand more to be shouted over it was when a strolling juggler with some\r\nhalf-trained monkeys, or a panting, feeble bear, or a woman who tied\r\ngoats\xe2\x80\x99 horns to her feet, and with these danced on a slack-rope, set\r\nthe horses to shying and the women to shrill, long-drawn quavers of\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nThe lama never raised his eyes. He did not note the money-lender on his\r\ngoose-rumped pony, hastening along to collect the cruel interest; or\r\nthe long-shouting, deep-voiced little mob\xe2\x80\x94still in military\r\nformation\xe2\x80\x94of native soldiers on leave, rejoicing to be rid of their\r\nbreeches and puttees, and saying the most outrageous things to the most\r\nrespectable women in sight. Even the seller of Ganges-water he did not\r\nsee, and Kim expected that he would at least buy a bottle of that\r\nprecious stuff. He looked steadily at the ground, and strode as\r\nsteadily hour after hour, his soul busied elsewhere. But Kim was in the\r\nseventh heaven of joy. The Grand Trunk at this point was built on an\r\nembankment to guard against winter floods from the foothills, so that\r\none walked, as it were, a little above the country, along a stately\r\ncorridor, seeing all India spread out to left and right. It was\r\nbeautiful to behold the many-yoked grain and cotton wagons crawling\r\nover the country roads: one could hear their axles, complaining a mile\r\naway, coming nearer, till with shouts and yells and bad words they\r\nclimbed up the steep incline and plunged on to the hard main road,\r\ncarter reviling carter. It was equally beautiful to watch the people,\r\nlittle clumps of red and blue and pink and white and saffron, turning\r\naside to go to their own villages, dispersing and growing small by twos\r\nand threes across the level plain. Kim felt these things, though he\r\ncould not give tongue to his feelings, and so contented himself with\r\nbuying peeled sugar-cane and spitting the pith generously about his\r\npath. From time to time the lama took snuff, and at last Kim could\r\nendure the silence no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a good land\xe2\x80\x94the land of the South!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe air is good;\r\nthe water is good. Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they are all bound upon the Wheel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cBound from\r\nlife after life. To none of these has the Way been shown.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook\r\nhimself back to this world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now we have walked a weary way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely we shall soon\r\ncome to a _parao_ (a resting-place). Shall we stay there? Look, the sun\r\nis sloping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho will receive us this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all one. This country is full of good folk. Besides\xe2\x80\x9d he sunk\r\nhis voice beneath a whisper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe have money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd thickened as they neared the resting-place which marked the\r\nend of their day\xe2\x80\x99s journey. A line of stalls selling very simple food\r\nand tobacco, a stack of firewood, a police-station, a well, a\r\nhorse-trough, a few trees, and, under them, some trampled ground dotted\r\nwith the black ashes of old fires, are all that mark a _parao_ on the\r\nGrand Trunk; if you except the beggars and the crows\xe2\x80\x94both hungry.\r\n\r\nBy this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through the lower\r\nbranches of the mango-trees; the parakeets and doves were coming home\r\nin their hundreds; the chattering, grey-backed Seven Sisters, talking\r\nover the day\xe2\x80\x99s adventures, walked back and forth in twos and threes\r\nalmost under the feet of the travellers; and shufflings and scufflings\r\nin the branches showed that the bats were ready to go out on the\r\nnight-picket. Swiftly the light gathered itself together, painted for\r\nan instant the faces and the cartwheels and the bullocks\xe2\x80\x99 horns as red\r\nas blood. Then the night fell, changing the touch of the air, drawing a\r\nlow, even haze, like a gossamer veil of blue, across the face of the\r\ncountry, and bringing out, keen and distinct, the smell of wood-smoke\r\nand cattle and the good scent of wheaten cakes cooked on ashes. The\r\nevening patrol hurried out of the police-station with important\r\ncoughings and reiterated orders; and a live charcoal ball in the cup of\r\na wayside carter\xe2\x80\x99s hookah glowed red while Kim\xe2\x80\x99s eye mechanically\r\nwatched the last flicker of the sun on the brass tweezers.\r\n\r\nThe life of the _parao_ was very like that of the Kashmir Serai on a\r\nsmall scale. Kim dived into the happy Asiatic disorder which, if you\r\nonly allow time, will bring you everything that a simple man needs.\r\n\r\nHis wants were few, because, since the lama had no caste scruples,\r\ncooked food from the nearest stall would serve; but, for luxury\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nKim bought a handful of dung-cakes to build a fire. All about, coming\r\nand going round the little flames, men cried for oil, or grain, or\r\nsweetmeats, or tobacco, jostling one another while they waited their\r\nturn at the well; and under the men\xe2\x80\x99s voices you heard from halted,\r\nshuttered carts the high squeals and giggles of women whose faces\r\nshould not be seen in public.\r\n\r\nNowadays, well-educated natives are of opinion that when their\r\nwomenfolk travel\xe2\x80\x94and they visit a good deal\xe2\x80\x94it is better to take them\r\nquickly by rail in a properly screened compartment; and that custom is\r\nspreading. But there are always those of the old rock who hold by the\r\nuse of their forefathers; and, above all, there are always the old\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94more conservative than the men\xe2\x80\x94who toward the end of their days\r\ngo on a pilgrimage. They, being withered and undesirable, do not, under\r\ncertain circumstances, object to unveiling. After their long seclusion,\r\nduring which they have always been in business touch with a thousand\r\noutside interests, they love the bustle and stir of the open road, the\r\ngatherings at the shrines, and the infinite possibilities of gossip\r\nwith like-minded dowagers. Very often it suits a longsuffering family\r\nthat a strong-tongued, iron-willed old lady should disport herself\r\nabout India in this fashion; for certainly pilgrimage is grateful to\r\nthe Gods. So all about India, in the most remote places, as in the most\r\npublic, you find some knot of grizzled servitors in nominal charge of\r\nan old lady who is more or less curtained and hid away in a\r\nbullock-cart. Such men are staid and discreet, and when a European or a\r\nhigh-caste native is near will net their charge with most elaborate\r\nprecautions; but in the ordinary haphazard chances of pilgrimage the\r\nprecautions are not taken. The old lady is, after all, intensely human,\r\nand lives to look upon life.\r\n\r\nKim marked down a gaily ornamented _ruth_ or family bullock-cart, with\r\na broidered canopy of two domes, like a double-humped camel, which had\r\njust been drawn into the _parao_. Eight men made its retinue, and two\r\nof the eight were armed with rusty sabres\xe2\x80\x94sure signs that they followed\r\na person of distinction, for the common folk do not bear arms. An\r\nincreasing cackle of complaints, orders, and jests, and what to a\r\nEuropean would have been bad language, came from behind the curtains.\r\nHere was evidently a woman used to command.\r\n\r\nKim looked over the retinue critically. Half of them were thin-legged,\r\ngrey-bearded Ooryas from down country. The other half were duffle-clad,\r\nfelt-hatted hillmen of the North; and that mixture told its own tale,\r\neven if he had not overheard the incessant sparring between the two\r\ndivisions. The old lady was going south on a visit\xe2\x80\x94probably to a rich\r\nrelative, most probably to a son-in-law, who had sent up an escort as a\r\nmark of respect. The hillmen would be of her own people\xe2\x80\x94Kulu or Kangra\r\nfolk. It was quite clear that she was not taking her daughter down to\r\nbe wedded, or the curtains would have been laced home and the guard\r\nwould have allowed no one near the car. A merry and a high-spirited\r\ndame, thought Kim, balancing the dung-cake in one hand, the cooked food\r\nin the other, and piloting the lama with a nudging shoulder. Something\r\nmight be made out of the meeting. The lama would give him no help, but,\r\nas a conscientious _chela_, Kim was delighted to beg for two.\r\n\r\nHe built his fire as close to the cart as he dared, waiting for one of\r\nthe escort to order him away. The lama dropped wearily to the ground,\r\nmuch as a heavy fruit-eating bat cowers, and returned to his rosary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand farther off, beggar!\xe2\x80\x9d The order was shouted in broken Hindustani\r\nby one of the hillmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! It is only a _pahari_ (a hillman)\xe2\x80\x9d, said Kim over his shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince when have the hill-asses owned all Hindustan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe retort was a swift and brilliant sketch of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree for three\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\xe2\x80\x99s voice was sweeter than ever, as he broke the dung-cake into\r\nfit pieces. \xe2\x80\x9cIn_ my_ country we call that the beginning of love-talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA harsh, thin cackle behind the curtains put the hillman on his mettle\r\nfor a second shot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so bad\xe2\x80\x94not so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim with calm. \xe2\x80\x9cBut have a care, my\r\nbrother, lest we\xe2\x80\x94_we_, I say\xe2\x80\x94be minded to give a curse or so in return.\r\nAnd our curses have the knack of biting home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Ooryas laughed; the hillman sprang forward threateningly. The lama\r\nsuddenly raised his head, bringing his huge tam-o\xe2\x80\x99-shanter hat into the\r\nfull light of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s new-started fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nThe man halted as though struck to stone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94am saved from a great\r\nsin,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foreigner has found him a priest at last,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered one of the\r\nOoryas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHai! Why is that beggar-brat not well beaten?\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman cried.\r\n\r\nThe hillman drew back to the cart and whispered something to the\r\ncurtain. There was dead silence, then a muttering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis goes well,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kim, pretending neither to see nor hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94he has eaten\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the hillman fawned on Kim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x94it is requested\r\nthat the Holy One will do the honour to talk to one who would speak to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter he has eaten he will sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim returned loftily. He could not\r\nquite see what new turn the game had taken, but stood resolute to\r\nprofit by it. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I will get him his food.\xe2\x80\x9d The last sentence, spoken\r\nloudly, ended with a sigh as of faintness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I myself and the others of my people will look to that\xe2\x80\x94if it is\r\npermitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, more loftily than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cHoly One, these\r\npeople will bring us food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe land is good. All the country of the South is good\xe2\x80\x94a great and a\r\nterrible world,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled the lama drowsily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, \xe2\x80\x9cbut look to it that we are well fed when he\r\nwakes. He is a very holy man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain one of the Ooryas said something contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not a _faquir_. He is not a down-country beggar,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim went on\r\nseverely, addressing the stars. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the most holy of holy men. He is\r\nabove all castes. I am his _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the flat thin voice behind the curtain; and Kim came,\r\nconscious that eyes he could not see were staring at him. One skinny\r\nbrown finger heavy with rings lay on the edge of the cart, and the talk\r\nwent this way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn exceedingly holy one. He comes from far off. He comes from Tibet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere in Tibet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom behind the snows\xe2\x80\x94from a very far place. He knows the stars; he\r\nmakes horoscopes; he reads nativities. But he does not do this for\r\nmoney. He does it for kindness and great charity. I am his disciple. I\r\nam called also the Friend of the Stars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art no hillman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him. He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars to show\r\nhim an end to his pilgrimage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! Consider, brat, that I am an old woman and not altogether a\r\nfool. Lamas I know, and to these I give reverence, but thou art no more\r\na lawful _chela_ than this my finger is the pole of this wagon. Thou\r\nart a casteless Hindu\xe2\x80\x94a bold and unblushing beggar, attached, belike,\r\nto the Holy One for the sake of gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo we not all work for gain?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim changed his tone promptly to match\r\nthat altered voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this was a bow drawn at a venture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave heard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat hast thou heard?\xe2\x80\x9d she snapped, rapping with the finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing that I well remember, but some talk in the bazars, which is\r\ndoubtless a lie, that even Rajahs\xe2\x80\x94small Hill Rajahs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut none the less of good Rajput blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly of good blood. That these even sell the more comely of their\r\nwomenfolk for gain. Down south they sell them\xe2\x80\x94to zemindars and such\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nof Oudh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf there be one thing in the world that the small Hill Rajahs deny it\r\nis just this charge; but it happens to be one thing that the bazars\r\nbelieve, when they discuss the mysterious slave-traffics of India. The\r\nold lady explained to Kim, in a tense, indignant whisper, precisely\r\nwhat manner and fashion of malignant liar he was. Had Kim hinted this\r\nwhen she was a girl, he would have been pommelled to death that same\r\nevening by an elephant. This was perfectly true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhai! I am only a beggar\xe2\x80\x99s brat, as the Eye of Beauty has said,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwailed in extravagant terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEye of Beauty, forsooth! Who am I that thou shouldst fling\r\nbeggar-endearments at me?\xe2\x80\x9d And yet she laughed at the long-forgotten\r\nword. \xe2\x80\x9cForty years ago that might have been said, and not without\r\ntruth. Ay. thirty years ago. But it is the fault of this gadding up and\r\ndown Hind that a king\xe2\x80\x99s widow must jostle all the scum of the land, and\r\nbe made a mock by beggars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Queen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim promptly, for he heard her shaking with\r\nindignation, \xe2\x80\x9cI am even what the Great Queen says I am; but none the\r\nless is my master holy. He has not yet heard the Great Queen\xe2\x80\x99s order\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrder? I order a Holy One\xe2\x80\x94a Teacher of the Law\xe2\x80\x94to come and speak to a\r\nwoman? Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity my stupidity. I thought it was given as an order\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not. It was a petition. Does this make all clear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silver coin clicked on the edge of the cart. Kim took it and salaamed\r\nprofoundly. The old lady recognized that, as the eyes and the ears of\r\nthe lama, he was to be propitiated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am but the Holy One\xe2\x80\x99s disciple. When he has eaten perhaps he will\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, villain and shameless rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d The jewelled forefinger shook itself\r\nat him reprovingly; but he could hear the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dropping into his most caressing and\r\nconfidential tone\xe2\x80\x94the one, he well knew, that few could resist. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nthere any need of a son in thy family? Speak freely, for we priests\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThat last was a direct plagiarism from a _faquir_ by the Taksali Gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe priests! Thou art not yet old enough to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She checked the joke with\r\nanother laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, now and again, we women, O priest, think of\r\nother matters than sons. Moreover, my daughter has borne her\r\nman-child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo arrows in the quiver are better than one; and three are better\r\nstill.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim quoted the proverb with a meditative cough, looking\r\ndiscreetly earthward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94oh, true. But perhaps that will come. Certainly those\r\ndown-country Brahmins are utterly useless. I sent gifts and monies and\r\ngifts again to them, and they prophesied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled Kim, with infinite contempt, \xe2\x80\x9cthey prophesied!\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nprofessional could have done no better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers were\r\nheard. I chose an auspicious hour, and\xe2\x80\x94perhaps thy Holy One has heard\r\nof the Abbot of the Lung-Cho lamassery. It was to him I put the matter,\r\nand behold in the due time all came about as I desired. The Brahmin in\r\nthe house of the father of my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s son has since said that it was\r\nthrough _his_ prayers\xe2\x80\x94which is a little error that I will explain to\r\nhim when we reach our journey\xe2\x80\x99s end. And so afterwards I go to Buddh\r\nGaya, to make _shraddha_ for the father of my children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThither go we.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubly auspicious,\xe2\x80\x9d chirruped the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cA second son at least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Friend of all the World!\xe2\x80\x9d The lama had waked, and, simply as a child\r\nbewildered in a strange bed, called for Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come! I come, Holy One!\xe2\x80\x9d He dashed to the fire, where he found the\r\nlama already surrounded by dishes of food, the hillmen visibly adoring\r\nhim and the Southerners looking sourly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back! Withdraw!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim cried. \xe2\x80\x9cDo we eat publicly like dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nfinished the meal in silence, each turned a little from the other, and\r\nKim topped it with a native-made cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I not said an hundred times that the South is a good land? Here\r\nis a virtuous and high-born widow of a Hill Rajah on pilgrimage, she\r\nsays, to Buddha Gay. She it is sends us those dishes; and when thou art\r\nwell rested she would speak to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this also thy work?\xe2\x80\x9d The lama dipped deep into his snuff-gourd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho else watched over thee since our wonderful journey began?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes danced in his head as he blew the rank smoke through his nostrils\r\nand stretched him on the dusty ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I failed to oversee thy\r\ncomforts, Holy One?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA blessing on thee.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama inclined his solemn head. \xe2\x80\x9cI have known\r\nmany men in my so long life, and disciples not a few. But to none among\r\nmen, if so be thou art woman-born, has my heart gone out as it has to\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94thoughtful, wise, and courteous; but something of a small imp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have never seen such a priest as thou.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim considered the\r\nbenevolent yellow face wrinkle by wrinkle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is less than three days\r\nsince we took the road together, and it is as though it were a hundred\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should have rendered\r\nthee some service. Maybe\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he smiled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI freed thee from a trap; or,\r\nhaving caught thee on a hook in the days when I was not enlightened,\r\ncast thee back into the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim quietly. He had heard this sort of speculation again\r\nand again, from the mouths of many whom the English would not consider\r\nimaginative. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, as regards that woman in the bullock-cart. _I_ think\r\nshe needs a second son for her daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no part of the Way,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cBut at least she is\r\nfrom the Hills. Ah, the Hills, and the snow of the Hills!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose and stalked to the cart. Kim would have given his ears to come\r\ntoo, but the lama did not invite him; and the few words he caught were\r\nin an unknown tongue, for they spoke some common speech of the\r\nmountains. The woman seemed to ask questions which the lama turned over\r\nin his mind before answering. Now and again he heard the singsong\r\ncadence of a Chinese quotation. It was a strange picture that Kim\r\nwatched between drooped eyelids. The lama, very straight and erect, the\r\ndeep folds of his yellow clothing slashed with black in the light of\r\nthe _parao_ fires precisely as a knotted tree-trunk is slashed with the\r\nshadows of the low sun, addressed a tinsel and lacquered _ruth_ which\r\nburned like a many-coloured jewel in the same uncertain light. The\r\npatterns on the gold-worked curtains ran up and down, melting and\r\nreforming as the folds shook and quivered to the night wind; and when\r\nthe talk grew more earnest the jewelled forefinger snapped out little\r\nsparks of light between the embroideries. Behind the cart was a wall of\r\nuncertain darkness speckled with little flames and alive with\r\nhalf-caught forms and faces and shadows. The voices of early evening\r\nhad settled down to one soothing hum whose deepest note was the steady\r\nchumping of the bullocks above their chopped straw, and whose highest\r\nwas the tinkle of a Bengali dancing-girl\xe2\x80\x99s _sitar_. Most men had eaten\r\nand pulled deep at their gurgling, grunting hookahs, which in full\r\nblast sound like bull-frogs.\r\n\r\nAt last the lama returned. A hillman walked behind him with a wadded\r\ncotton-quilt and spread it carefully by the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe deserves ten thousand grandchildren,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cNone the less,\r\nbut for me, those gifts would not have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA virtuous woman\xe2\x80\x94and a wise one.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama slackened off, joint by\r\njoint, like a slow camel. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world is full of charity to those who\r\nfollow the Way.\xe2\x80\x9d He flung a fair half of the quilt over Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what said she?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim rolled up in his share of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe asked me many questions and propounded many problems\xe2\x80\x94the most of\r\nwhich were idle tales which she had heard from devil-serving priests\r\nwho pretend to follow the Way. Some I answered, and some I said were\r\nfoolish. Many wear the Robe, but few keep the Way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. That is true.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim used the thoughtful, conciliatory tone of\r\nthose who wish to draw confidences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut by her lights she is most right-minded. She desires greatly that\r\nwe should go with her to Buddh Gaya; her road being ours, as I\r\nunderstand, for many days\xe2\x80\x99 journey to the southward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience a little. To this I said that my Search came before all\r\nthings. She had heard many foolish legends, but this great truth of my\r\nRiver she had never heard. Such are the priests of the lower hills! She\r\nknew the Abbot of Lung-Cho, but she did not know of my River\xe2\x80\x94nor the\r\ntale of the Arrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke therefore of the Search, and of the Way, and of matters that\r\nwere profitable; she desiring only that I should accompany her and make\r\nprayer for a second son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! \xe2\x80\x98We women\xe2\x80\x99 do _not_ think of anything save children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim\r\nsleepily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, since our roads run together for a while, I do not see that we in\r\nany way depart from our Search if so be we accompany her\xe2\x80\x94at least as\r\nfar as\xe2\x80\x94I have forgotten the name of the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, turning and speaking in a sharp whisper to one of the\r\nOoryas a few yards away. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your master\xe2\x80\x99s house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little behind Saharunpore, among the fruit gardens.\xe2\x80\x9d He named the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the place,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cSo far, at least, we can go with\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlies go to carrion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Oorya, in an abstracted voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the sick cow a crow; for the sick man a Brahmin.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim breathed the\r\nproverb impersonally to the shadow-tops of the trees overhead.\r\n\r\nThe Oorya grunted and held his peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then we go with her, Holy One?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any reason against? I can still step aside and try all the\r\nrivers that the road overpasses. She desires that I should come. She\r\nvery greatly desires it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim stifled a laugh in the quilt. When once that imperious old lady had\r\nrecovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it probable that\r\nshe would be worth listening to.\r\n\r\nHe was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nhusbands of the talkative have a great reward hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Kim\r\nheard him snuff thrice, and dozed off, still laughing.\r\n\r\nThe diamond-bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks together. Kim\r\nsat up and yawned, shook himself, and thrilled with delight. This was\r\nseeing the world in real truth; this was life as he would have\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94bustling and shouting, the buckling of belts, and beating of\r\nbullocks and creaking of wheels, lighting of fires and cooking of food,\r\nand new sights at every turn of the approving eye. The morning mist\r\nswept off in a whorl of silver, the parrots shot away to some distant\r\nriver in shrieking green hosts: all the well-wheels within ear-shot\r\nwent to work. India was awake, and Kim was in the middle of it, more\r\nawake and more excited than anyone, chewing on a twig that he would\r\npresently use as a toothbrush; for he borrowed right- and left-handedly\r\nfrom all the customs of the country he knew and loved. There was no\r\nneed to worry about food\xe2\x80\x94no need to spend a cowrie at the crowded\r\nstalls. He was the disciple of a holy man annexed by a strong-willed\r\nold lady. All things would be prepared for them, and when they were\r\nrespectfully invited so to do they would sit and eat. For the rest\xe2\x80\x94Kim\r\ngiggled here as he cleaned his teeth\xe2\x80\x94his hostess would rather heighten\r\nthe enjoyment of the road. He inspected her bullocks critically, as\r\nthey came up grunting and blowing under the yokes. If they went too\r\nfast\xe2\x80\x94it was not likely\xe2\x80\x94there would be a pleasant seat for himself along\r\nthe pole; the lama would sit beside the driver. The escort, of course,\r\nwould walk. The old lady, equally of course, would talk a great deal,\r\nand by what he had heard that conversation would not lack salt. She was\r\nalready ordering, haranguing, rebuking, and, it must be said, cursing\r\nher servants for delays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet her her pipe. In the name of the Gods, get her her pipe and stop\r\nher ill-omened mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d cried an Oorya, tying up his shapeless bundles\r\nof bedding. \xe2\x80\x9cShe and the parrots are alike. They screech in the dawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lead-bullocks! Hai! Look to the lead-bullocks!\xe2\x80\x9d They were backing\r\nand wheeling as a grain-cart\xe2\x80\x99s axle caught them by the horns. \xe2\x80\x9cSon of\r\nan owl, where dost thou go?\xe2\x80\x9d This to the grinning carter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAi! Yai! Yai! That within there is the Queen of Delhi going to pray\r\nfor a son,\xe2\x80\x9d the man called back over his high load. \xe2\x80\x9cRoom for the Queen\r\nof Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey climbing up his own\r\nsword!\xe2\x80\x9d Another cart loaded with bark for a down-country tannery\r\nfollowed close behind, and its driver added a few compliments as the\r\n_ruth_-bullocks backed and backed again.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the shaking curtains came one volley of invective. It did\r\nnot last long, but in kind and quality, in blistering, biting\r\nappropriateness, it was beyond anything that even Kim had heard. He\r\ncould see the carter\xe2\x80\x99s bare chest collapse with amazement, as the man\r\nsalaamed reverently to the voice, leaped from the pole, and helped the\r\nescort haul their volcano on to the main road. Here the voice told him\r\ntruthfully what sort of wife he had wedded, and what she was doing in\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _shabash!_\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Kim, unable to contain himself, as the man\r\nslunk away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, indeed? It is a shame and a scandal that a poor woman may\r\nnot go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled and insulted by\r\nall the refuse of Hindustan\xe2\x80\x94that she must eat _g\xc3\xa2li_ (abuse) as men eat\r\n_ghi_. But I have yet a wag left to my tongue\xe2\x80\x94a word or two well spoken\r\nthat serves the occasion. And _still_ am I without my tobacco! Who is\r\nthe one-eyed and luckless son of shame that has not yet prepared my\r\npipe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was hastily thrust in by a hillman, and a trickle of thick smoke\r\nfrom each corner of the curtains showed that peace was restored.\r\n\r\nIf Kim had walked proudly the day before, disciple of a holy man, today\r\nhe paced with tenfold pride in the train of a semi-royal procession,\r\nwith a recognized place under the patronage of an old lady of charming\r\nmanners and infinite resource. The escort, their heads tied up\r\nnative-fashion, fell in on either side the cart, shuffling enormous\r\nclouds of dust.\r\n\r\nThe lama and Kim walked a little to one side; Kim chewing his stick of\r\nsugarcane, and making way for no one under the status of a priest. They\r\ncould hear the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s tongue clack as steadily as a rice-husker.\r\nShe bade the escort tell her what was going on on the road; and so soon\r\nas they were clear of the _parao_ she flung back the curtains and\r\npeered out, her veil a third across her face. Her men did not eye her\r\ndirectly when she addressed them, and thus the proprieties were more or\r\nless observed.\r\n\r\nA dark, sallowish District Superintendent of Police, faultlessly\r\nuniformed, an Englishman, trotted by on a tired horse, and, seeing from\r\nher retinue what manner of person she was, chaffed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cdo they do this in the _zenanas?_ Suppose an\r\nEnglishman came by and saw that thou hast no nose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she shrilled back. \xe2\x80\x9cThine own mother has no nose? Why say so,\r\nthen, on the open road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a fair counter. The Englishman threw up his hand with the\r\ngesture of a man hit at sword-play. She laughed and nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this a face to tempt virtue aside?\xe2\x80\x9d She withdrew all her veil and\r\nstared at him.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means lovely, but as the man gathered up his reins he\r\ncalled it a Moon of Paradise, a Disturber of Integrity, and a few other\r\nfantastic epithets which doubled her up with mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a _nut-cut_ (rogue),\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll police-constables are\r\n_nut-cuts;_ but the police-wallahs are the worst. Hai, my son, thou\r\nhast never learned all that since thou camest from _Belait_ (Europe).\r\nWho suckled thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _pahareen_\xe2\x80\x94a hillwoman of Dalhousie, my mother. Keep thy beauty\r\nunder a shade\xe2\x80\x94O Dispenser of Delights,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese be the sort\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she took a fine judicial tone, and stuffed her\r\nmouth with _pan_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThese be the sort to oversee justice. They know the\r\nland and the customs of the land. The others, all new from Europe,\r\nsuckled by white women and learning our tongues from books, are worse\r\nthan the pestilence. They do harm to Kings.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she told a long, long\r\ntale to the world at large, of an ignorant young policeman who had\r\ndisturbed some small Hill Rajah, a ninth cousin of her own, in the\r\nmatter of a trivial land-case, winding up with a quotation from a work\r\nby no means devotional.\r\n\r\nThen her mood changed, and she bade one of the escort ask whether the\r\nlama would walk alongside and discuss matters of religion. So Kim\r\ndropped back into the dust and returned to his sugar-cane. For an hour\r\nor more the lama\xe2\x80\x99s tam-o\xe2\x80\x99shanter showed like a moon through the haze;\r\nand, from all he heard, Kim gathered that the old woman wept. One of\r\nthe Ooryas half apologized for his rudeness overnight, saying that he\r\nhad never known his mistress of so bland a temper, and he ascribed it\r\nto the presence of the strange priest. Personally, he believed in\r\nBrahmins, though, like all natives, he was acutely aware of their\r\ncunning and their greed. Still, when Brahmins but irritated with\r\nbegging demands the mother of his master\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and when she sent them\r\naway so angry that they cursed the whole retinue (which was the real\r\nreason of the second off-side bullock going lame, and of the pole\r\nbreaking the night before), he was prepared to accept any priest of any\r\nother denomination in or out of India. To this Kim assented with wise\r\nnods, and bade the Oorya observe that the lama took no money, and that\r\nthe cost of his and Kim\xe2\x80\x99s food would be repaid a hundred times in the\r\ngood luck that would attend the caravan henceforward. He also told\r\nstories of Lahore city, and sang a song or two which made the escort\r\nlaugh. As a town-mouse well acquainted with the latest songs by the\r\nmost fashionable composers\xe2\x80\x94they are women for the most part\xe2\x80\x94Kim had a\r\ndistinct advantage over men from a little fruit-village behind\r\nSaharunpore, but he let that advantage be inferred.\r\n\r\nAt noon they turned aside to eat, and the meal was good, plentiful, and\r\nwell-served on plates of clean leaves, in decency, out of drift of the\r\ndust. They gave the scraps to certain beggars, that all requirements\r\nmight be fulfilled, and sat down to a long, luxurious smoke. The old\r\nlady had retreated behind her curtains, but mixed most freely in the\r\ntalk, her servants arguing with and contradicting her as servants do\r\nthroughout the East. She compared the cool and the pines of the Kangra\r\nand Kulu hills with the dust and the mangoes of the South; she told a\r\ntale of some old local Gods at the edge of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s territory; she\r\nroundly abused the tobacco which she was then smoking, reviled all\r\nBrahmins, and speculated without reserve on the coming of many\r\ngrandsons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nHere come I to my own again\r\nFed, forgiven, and known again\r\nClaimed by bone of my bone again,\r\n    And sib to flesh of my flesh!\r\nThe fatted calf is dressed for me,\r\nBut the husks have greater zest for me ...\r\nI think my pigs will be best for me,\r\n    So I\xe2\x80\x99m off to the styes afresh.\r\n\r\n_The Prodigal Son_.\r\n\r\nOnce more the lazy, string-tied, shuffling procession got under way,\r\nand she slept till they reached the next halting-stage. It was a very\r\nshort march, and time lacked an hour to sundown, so Kim cast about for\r\nmeans of amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not sit and rest?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the escort. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the devils\r\nand the English walk to and fro without reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever make friends with the Devil, a Monkey, or a Boy. No man knows\r\nwhat they will do next,\xe2\x80\x9d said his fellow.\r\n\r\nKim turned a scornful back\xe2\x80\x94he did not want to hear the old story how\r\nthe Devil played with the boys and repented of it and walked idly\r\nacross country.\r\n\r\nThe lama strode after him. All that day, whenever they passed a stream,\r\nhe had turned aside to look at it, but in no case had he received any\r\nwarning that he had found his River. Insensibly, too, the comfort of\r\nspeaking to someone in a reasonable tongue, and of being properly\r\nconsidered and respected as her spiritual adviser by a well-born woman,\r\nhad weaned his thoughts a little from the Search. And further, he was\r\nprepared to spend serene years in his quest; having nothing of the\r\nwhite man\xe2\x80\x99s impatience, but a great faith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere goest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d he called after Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhither\xe2\x80\x94it was a small march, and all this\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim waved his hands\r\nabroad\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis new to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is beyond question a wise and a discerning woman. But it is hard\r\nto meditate when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll women are thus.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim spoke as might have Solomon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the lamassery was a broad platform,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama muttered, looping\r\nup the well-worn rosary, \xe2\x80\x9cof stone. On that I have left the marks of my\r\nfeet\xe2\x80\x94pacing to and fro with these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clicked the beads, and began the \xe2\x80\x9c_Om mane pudme hum_\xe2\x80\x9d of his\r\ndevotion; grateful for the cool, the quiet, and the absence of dust.\r\n\r\nOne thing after another drew Kim\xe2\x80\x99s idle eye across the plain. There was\r\nno purpose in his wanderings, except that the build of the huts near by\r\nseemed new, and he wished to investigate.\r\n\r\nThey came out on a broad tract of grazing-ground, brown and purple in\r\nthe afternoon light, with a heavy clump of mangoes in the centre. It\r\nstruck Kim as curious that no shrine stood in so eligible a spot: the\r\nboy was observing as any priest for these things. Far across the plain\r\nwalked side by side four men, made small by the distance. He looked\r\nintently under his curved palms and caught the sheen of brass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoldiers. White soldiers!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together. But I\r\nhave never seen the white soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do no harm except when they are drunk. Keep behind this tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stepped behind the thick trunks in the cool dark of the\r\nmango-tope. Two little figures halted; the other two came forward\r\nuncertainly. They were the advance-party of a regiment on the march,\r\nsent out, as usual, to mark the camp. They bore five-foot sticks with\r\nfluttering flags, and called to each other as they spread over the flat\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAt last they entered the mango-grove, walking heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s here or hereabouts\xe2\x80\x94officers\xe2\x80\x99 tents under the trees, I take it,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 the rest of us can stay outside. Have they marked out for the\r\nbaggage-wagons behind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey cried again to their comrades in the distance, and the rough\r\nanswer came back faint and mellowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShove the flag in here, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they prepare?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, wonderstruck. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a great\r\nand terrible world. What is the device on the flag?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA soldier thrust a stave within a few feet of them, grunted\r\ndiscontentedly, pulled it up again, conferred with his companion, who\r\nlooked up and down the shaded cave of greenery, and returned it.\r\n\r\nKim stared with all his eyes, his breath coming short and sharp between\r\nhis teeth. The soldiers stamped off into the sunshine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Holy One!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cMy horoscope! The drawing in the dust by the\r\npriest at Umballa! Remember what he said. First come two\xe2\x80\x94_ferashes_\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nmake all things ready\xe2\x80\x94in a dark place, as it is always at the beginning\r\nof a vision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is not vision,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the world\xe2\x80\x99s Illusion,\r\nand no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after them comes the Bull\xe2\x80\x94the Red Bull on the green field. Look!\r\nIt is he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the flag that was snap snapping in the evening breeze not\r\nten feet away. It was no more than an ordinary camp marking-flag; but\r\nthe regiment, always punctilious in matters of millinery, had charged\r\nit with the regimental device, the Red Bull, which is the crest of the\r\nMavericks\xe2\x80\x94the great Red Bull on a background of Irish green.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, and now I remember.\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it is thy Bull.\r\nCertainly, also, the two men came to make all ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are soldiers\xe2\x80\x94white soldiers. What said the priest? \xe2\x80\x98The sign over\r\nagainst the Bull is the sign of War and armed men.\xe2\x80\x99 Holy One, this\r\nthing touches my Search.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. It is true.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama stared fixedly at the device that flamed\r\nlike a ruby in the dusk. \xe2\x80\x9cThe priest at Umballa said that thine was the\r\nsign of War.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to do now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait. Let us wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven now the darkness clears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. It was only natural that the\r\ndescending sun should at last strike through the tree-trunks, across\r\nthe grove, filling it with mealy gold light for a few minutes; but to\r\nKim it was the crown of the Umballa Brahmin\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cOne beats a drum\xe2\x80\x94far off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first the sound, carrying diluted through the still air, resembled\r\nthe beating of an artery in the head. Soon a sharpness was added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! The music,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim explained. He knew the sound of a regimental band,\r\nbut it amazed the lama.\r\n\r\nAt the far end of the plain a heavy, dusty column crawled in sight.\r\nThen the wind brought the tune:\r\n\r\nWe crave your condescension\r\nTo tell you what we know\r\nOf marching in the Mulligan Guards\r\nTo Sligo Port below!\r\n\r\nHere broke in the shrill-tongued fifes:\r\n\r\nWe shouldered arms,\r\nWe marched\xe2\x80\x94we marched away.\r\nFrom Ph\xc5\x93nix Park\r\nWe marched to Dublin Bay.\r\nThe drums and the fifes,\r\nOh, sweetly they did play,\r\nAs we marched\xe2\x80\x94marched\xe2\x80\x94marched\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\nMulligan Guards!\r\n\r\nIt was the band of the Mavericks playing the regiment to camp; for the\r\nmen were route-marching with their baggage. The rippling column swung\r\ninto the level\xe2\x80\x94carts behind it divided left and right, ran about like\r\nan ant-hill, and ...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is sorcery!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama.\r\n\r\nThe plain dotted itself with tents that seemed to rise, all spread,\r\nfrom the carts. Another rush of men invaded the grove, pitched a huge\r\ntent in silence, ran up yet eight or nine more by the side of it,\r\nunearthed cooking-pots, pans, and bundles, which were taken possession\r\nof by a crowd of native servants; and behold the mango-tope turned into\r\nan orderly town as they watched!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, sinking back afraid, as the fires twinkled\r\nand white officers with jingling swords stalked into the Mess-tent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand back in the shadow. No one can see beyond the light of a fire,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Kim, his eyes still on the flag. He had never before watched the\r\nroutine of a seasoned regiment pitching camp in thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! look! look!\xe2\x80\x9d clucked the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cYonder comes a priest.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nBennett, the Church of England Chaplain of the regiment, limping in\r\ndusty black. One of his flock had made some rude remarks about the\r\nChaplain\xe2\x80\x99s mettle; and to abash him Bennett had marched step by step\r\nwith the men that day. The black dress, gold cross on the watch-chain,\r\nthe hairless face, and the soft, black wideawake hat would have marked\r\nhim as a holy man anywhere in all India. He dropped into a camp-chair\r\nby the door of the Mess-tent and slid off his boots. Three or four\r\nofficers gathered round him, laughing and joking over his exploit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama,\r\nwho judged only by tone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I considered the countenance of that\r\npriest and I think he is learned. Is it likely that he will understand\r\nour talk? I would talk to him of my Search.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever speak to a white man till he is fed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, quoting a\r\nwell-known proverb. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will eat now, and\xe2\x80\x94and I do not think they are\r\ngood to beg from. Let us go back to the resting-place. After we have\r\neaten we will come again. It certainly was a Red Bull\xe2\x80\x94_my_ Red Bull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were both noticeably absent-minded when the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s retinue set\r\ntheir meal before them; so none broke their reserve, for it is not\r\nlucky to annoy guests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, picking his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will return to that place; but\r\nthou, O Holy One, must wait a little way off, because thy feet are\r\nheavier than mine and I am anxious to see more of that Red Bull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how canst thou understand the talk? Walk slowly. The road is\r\ndark,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama replied uneasily.\r\n\r\nKim put the question aside. \xe2\x80\x9cI marked a place near to the trees,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere thou canst sit till I call. Nay,\xe2\x80\x9d as the lama made some sort\r\nof protest, \xe2\x80\x9cremember this is _my_ Search\xe2\x80\x94the Search for my Red Bull.\r\nThe sign in the Stars was not for thee. I know a little of the customs\r\nof white soldiers, and I always desire to see some new things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou not know of this world?\xe2\x80\x9d The lama squatted obediently\r\nin a little hollow of the ground not a hundred yards from the hump of\r\nthe mango-trees dark against the star-powdered sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay till I call.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim flitted into the dusk. He knew that in all\r\nprobability there would be sentries round the camp, and smiled to\r\nhimself as he heard the thick boots of one. A boy who can dodge over\r\nthe roofs of Lahore city on a moonlight night, using every little patch\r\nand corner of darkness to discomfit his pursuer, is not likely to be\r\nchecked by a line of well-trained soldiers. He paid them the compliment\r\nof crawling between a couple, and, running and halting, crouching and\r\ndropping flat, worked his way toward the lighted Mess-tent where, close\r\npressed behind the mango-tree, he waited till some chance word should\r\ngive him a returnable lead.\r\n\r\nThe one thing now in his mind was further information as to the Red\r\nBull. For aught he knew, and Kim\xe2\x80\x99s limitations were as curious and\r\nsudden as his expansions, the men, the nine hundred thorough devils of\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy, might pray to the beast after dark, as Hindus\r\npray to the Holy Cow. That at least would be entirely right and\r\nlogical, and the padre with the gold cross would be therefore the man\r\nto consult in the matter. On the other hand, remembering sober-faced\r\npadres whom he had avoided in Lahore city, the priest might be an\r\ninquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn. But had it not been\r\nproven at Umballa that his sign in the high heavens portended War and\r\narmed men? Was he not the Friend of the Stars as well as of all the\r\nWorld, crammed to the teeth with dreadful secrets? Lastly\xe2\x80\x94and firstly\r\nas the undercurrent of all his quick thoughts\xe2\x80\x94this adventure, though he\r\ndid not know the English word, was a stupendous lark\xe2\x80\x94a delightful\r\ncontinuation of his old flights across the housetops, as well as the\r\nfulfilment of sublime prophecy. He lay belly-flat and wriggled towards\r\nthe Mess-tent door, a hand on the amulet round his neck.\r\n\r\nIt was as he suspected. The Sahibs prayed to their God; for in the\r\ncentre of the Mess-table\xe2\x80\x94its sole ornament when they were on the line\r\nof march\xe2\x80\x94stood a golden bull fashioned from old-time loot of the Summer\r\nPalace at Pekin\xe2\x80\x94a red-gold bull with lowered head, ramping upon a field\r\nof Irish green. To him the Sahibs held out their glasses and cried\r\naloud confusedly.\r\n\r\nNow the Reverend Arthur Bennett always left Mess after that toast, and\r\nbeing rather tired by his march his movements were more abrupt than\r\nusual. Kim, with slightly raised head, was still staring at his totem\r\non the table, when the Chaplain stepped on his right shoulder-blade.\r\nKim flinched under the leather, and, rolling sideways, brought down the\r\nChaplain, who, ever a man of action, caught him by the throat and\r\nnearly choked the life out of him. Kim then kicked him desperately in\r\nthe stomach. Mr Bennett gasped and doubled up, but without relaxing his\r\ngrip, rolled over again, and silently hauled Kim to his own tent. The\r\nMavericks were incurable practical jokers; and it occurred to the\r\nEnglishman that silence was best till he had made complete inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he drew his prize under the light of the\r\ntent-pole lantern, then shaking him severely cried: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you\r\ndoing? You\xe2\x80\x99re a thief. _Choor? Mallum?_\xe2\x80\x9d His Hindustanee was very\r\nlimited, and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to keep to the\r\ncharacter laid down for him. As he recovered his breath he was\r\ninventing a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to some\r\nscullion, and at the same time keeping a keen eye on and a little under\r\nthe Chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s left arm-pit. The chance came; he ducked for the\r\ndoorway, but a long arm shot out and clutched at his neck, snapping the\r\namulet-string and closing on the amulet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it me. O, give it me. Is it lost? Give me the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were in English\xe2\x80\x94the tinny, saw-cut English of the\r\nnative-bred, and the Chaplain jumped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA scapular,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, opening his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, some sort of heathen\r\ncharm. Why\xe2\x80\x94why, do you speak English? Little boys who steal are beaten.\r\nYou know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not\xe2\x80\x94I did not steal.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim danced in agony like a terrier at a\r\nlifted stick. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, give it me. It is my charm. Do not thieve it from\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chaplain took no heed, but, going to the tent door, called aloud. A\r\nfattish, clean-shaven man appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want your advice, Father Victor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bennett. \xe2\x80\x9cI found this boy in\r\nthe dark outside the Mess-tent. Ordinarily, I should have chastised him\r\nand let him go, because I believe him to be a thief. But it seems he\r\ntalks English, and he attaches some sort of value to a charm round his\r\nneck. I thought perhaps you might help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the Irish contingent\r\nlay, as Bennett believed, an unbridgeable gulf, but it was noticeable\r\nthat whenever the Church of England dealt with a human problem she was\r\nvery likely to call in the Church of Rome. Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s official\r\nabhorrence of the Scarlet Woman and all her ways was only equalled by\r\nhis private respect for Father Victor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thief talking English, is it? Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at his charm. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\na scapular, Bennett.\xe2\x80\x9d He held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut have we any right to open it? A sound whipping\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did _not_ thieve,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have hit me kicks all over my\r\nbody. Now give me my charm and I will go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite so fast. We\xe2\x80\x99ll look first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor, leisurely\r\nrolling out poor Kimball O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c_ne varietur_\xe2\x80\x9d parchment, his\r\nclearance-certificate, and Kim\xe2\x80\x99s baptismal certificate. On this last\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x94with some confused idea that he was doing wonders for his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x94had scrawled scores of times: \xe2\x80\x9c_Look after the boy. Please look\r\nafter the boy_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94signing his name and regimental number in full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPowers of Darkness below!\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor, passing all over to Mr\r\nBennett. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what these things are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are mine, and I want to go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not quite understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Bennett. \xe2\x80\x9cHe probably brought them\r\non purpose. It may be a begging trick of some kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company, then.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the makings of a gay mystery here. Ye believe in Providence,\r\nBennett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I believe in miracles, so it comes to the same thing. Powers of\r\nDarkness! Kimball O\xe2\x80\x99Hara! And his son! But then he\xe2\x80\x99s a native, and I\r\nsaw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott. How long have you had these\r\nthings, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver since I was a little baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFather Victor stepped forward quickly and opened the front of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nupper garment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Bennett, he\xe2\x80\x99s not very black. What\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr Kimball?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. Will you let me go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey call me Kim Rishti ke. That is Kim of the Rishti.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Rishti\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Eye_-rishti\xe2\x80\x94that was the Regiment\xe2\x80\x94my father\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIrish\xe2\x80\x94oh, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYess. That was how my father told me. My father, he has lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas lived where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas lived. Of _course_ he is dead\xe2\x80\x94gone-out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! That\xe2\x80\x99s your abrupt way of putting it, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBennett interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible I have done the boy an injustice.\r\nHe is certainly white, though evidently neglected. I am sure I must\r\nhave bruised him. I do not think spirits\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet him a glass of sherry, then, and let him squat on the cot. Now,\r\nKim,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Father Victor, \xe2\x80\x9cno one is going to hurt you. Drink that\r\ndown and tell us about yourself. The truth, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve no objection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass, and considered.\r\nThis seemed a time for caution and fancy. Small boys who prowl about\r\ncamps are generally turned out after a whipping. But he had received no\r\nstripes; the amulet was evidently working in his favour, and it looked\r\nas though the Umballa horoscope and the few words that he could\r\nremember of his father\xe2\x80\x99s maunderings fitted in most miraculously. Else\r\nwhy did the fat padre seem so impressed, and why the glass of hot\r\nyellow drink from the lean one?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little. The\r\nwoman, she kept _kabarri_ shop near where the hire-carriages are.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\r\nbegan with a plunge, not quite sure how far the truth would serve him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_No!_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with a gesture of disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cShe went out when I was born. My\r\nfather, he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher what do you call that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Bennett nodded) \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he was in good-standing. What do you call\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d (again Bennett nodded). \xe2\x80\x9cMy father told me that. He said, too,\r\nand also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa two\r\ndays ago, _he_ said, that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field and\r\nthat the Bull shall help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA phenomenal little liar,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Bennett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPowers of Darkness below, what a country!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Father Victor. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\non, Kim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did _not_ thieve. Besides, I am just now disciple of a very holy\r\nman. He is sitting outside. We saw two men come with flags, making the\r\nplace ready. That is _always_ so in a dream, or on account of\r\na\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94prophecy. So I knew it was come true. I saw the Red Bull on the\r\ngreen field, and my father he said: \xe2\x80\x98Nine hundred _pukka_ devils and\r\nthe Colonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find the Red\r\nBull!\xe2\x80\x99 I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull, but I went away\r\nand I came again when it was dark. I wanted to see the Bull again, and\r\nI saw the Bull again with the\xe2\x80\x94the Sahibs praying to it. I think the\r\nBull shall help me. The holy man said so too. He is sitting outside.\r\nWill you hurt him, if I call him a shout now? He is very holy. He can\r\nwitness to all the things I say, and he knows I am not a thief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Sahibs praying to a bull!\xe2\x80\x99 What in the world do you make of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bennett. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Disciple of a holy man!\xe2\x80\x99 Is the boy mad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s boy, sure enough. O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s boy leagued with all the\r\nPowers of Darkness. It\xe2\x80\x99s very much what his father would have done if\r\nhe was drunk. We\xe2\x80\x99d better invite the holy man. He may know something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not know anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cI will show you him if you\r\ncome. He is my master. Then afterwards we can go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPowers of Darkness!\xe2\x80\x9d was all that Father Victor could say, as Bennett\r\nmarched off, with a firm hand on Kim\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey found the lama where he had dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Search is at an end for me,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Kim in the vernacular. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave found the Bull, but God knows what comes next. They will not hurt\r\nyou. Come to the fat priest\xe2\x80\x99s tent with this thin man and see the end.\r\nIt is all new, and they cannot talk Hindi. They are only uncurried\r\ndonkeys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama\r\nreturned. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad if thou art rejoiced, _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDignified and unsuspicious, he strode into the little tent, saluted the\r\nChurches as a Churchman, and sat down by the open charcoal brazier. The\r\nyellow lining of the tent reflected in the lamplight made his face\r\nred-gold.\r\n\r\nBennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of the creed\r\nthat lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of \xe2\x80\x9cheathen\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what was the end of the Search? What gift has the Red Bull\r\nbrought?\xe2\x80\x9d The lama addressed himself to Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says, \xe2\x80\x98What are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Bennett was staring uneasily at\r\nFather Victor, and Kim, for his own ends, took upon himself the office\r\nof interpreter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not see what concern this _faquir_ has with the boy, who is\r\nprobably his dupe or his confederate,\xe2\x80\x9d Bennett began. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot allow\r\nan English boy\xe2\x80\x94Assuming that he is the son of a Mason, the sooner he\r\ngoes to the Masonic Orphanage the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! That\xe2\x80\x99s your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental Lodge,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFather Victor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we might as well tell the old man what we are going\r\nto do. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a villain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind. Now,\r\nKimball, I wish you to tell this man what I say word for word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim gathered the import of the next few sentences and began thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly One, the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am the son\r\nof a Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is true. I knew it since my birth, but _he_ could only find it\r\nout by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all the papers. He\r\nthinks that once a Sahib is always a Sahib, and between the two of them\r\nthey purpose to keep me in this Regiment or to send me to a _madrissah_\r\n(a school). It has happened before. I have always avoided it. The fat\r\nfool is of one mind and the camel-like one of another. But that is no\r\nodds. I may spend one night here and perhaps the next. It has happened\r\nbefore. Then I will run away and return to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell them that thou art my _chela_. Tell them how thou didst come\r\nto me when I was faint and bewildered. Tell them of our Search, and\r\nthey will surely let thee go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told them. They laugh, and they talk of the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you saying?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr Bennett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah. He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop him in his\r\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x94his ur-gent private af-fairs.\xe2\x80\x9d This last was a reminiscence of\r\nsome talk with a Eurasian clerk in the Canal Department, but it only\r\ndrew a smile, which nettled him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you _did_ know what his\r\nbusiness was you would not be in such a beastly hurry to interfere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor, not without feeling, as he\r\nwatched the lama\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a River in this country which he wishes to find so verree\r\nmuch. It was put out by an Arrow which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Kim tapped his foot\r\nimpatiently as he translated in his own mind from the vernacular to his\r\nclumsy English. \xe2\x80\x9cOah, it was made by our Lord God Buddha, you know, and\r\nif you wash there you are washed away from all your sins and made as\r\nwhite as cotton-wool.\xe2\x80\x9d (Kim had heard mission-talk in his time.) \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nhis disciple, and we _must_ find that River. It is so verree valuable\r\nto us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bennett. Kim obeyed, with amplifications.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is gross blasphemy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Church of England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTck! Tck!\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor sympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give a good deal\r\nto be able to talk the vernacular. A river that washes away sin! And\r\nhow long have you two been looking for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, many days. Now we wish to go away and look for it again. It is not\r\nhere, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he can\xe2\x80\x99t go on in that old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s company. It would be different, Kim, if you were not a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson. Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you and make you as\r\ngood a man as your\xe2\x80\x94as good a man as can be. Tell him that if he\r\nbelieves in miracles he must believe that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to play on his credulity,\xe2\x80\x9d Bennett interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m doing no such thing. He must believe that the boy\xe2\x80\x99s coming here\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nhis own Regiment\xe2\x80\x94in search of his Red Bull is in the nature of a\r\nmiracle. Consider the chances against it, Bennett. This one boy in all\r\nIndia, and our Regiment of all others on the line o\xe2\x80\x99 march for him to\r\nmeet with! It\xe2\x80\x99s predestined on the face of it. Yes, tell him it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Kismet. Kismet, mallum?_ (Do you understand?)\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned towards the lama, to whom he might as well have talked of\r\nMesopotamia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the old man\xe2\x80\x99s eye lighted at Kim\xe2\x80\x99s speech \xe2\x80\x9cthey say that\r\nthe meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished, and that being led\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94though as thou knowest I went out of curiosity\xe2\x80\x94to these people and\r\ntheir Red Bull I must needs go to a _madrissah_ and be turned into a\r\nSahib. Now I make pretence of agreement, for at the worst it will be\r\nbut a few meals eaten away from thee. Then I will slip away and follow\r\ndown the road to Saharunpore. Therefore, Holy One, keep with that Kulu\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94on no account stray far from her cart till I come again. Past\r\nquestion, my sign is of War and of armed men. See how they have given\r\nme wine to drink and set me upon a bed of honour! My father must have\r\nbeen some great person. So if they raise me to honour among them, good.\r\nIf not, good again. However it goes, I will run back to thee when I am\r\ntired. But stay with the Rajputni, or I shall miss thy feet ... Oah\r\nyess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cI have told him everything you tell me to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I cannot see any need why he should wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bennett, feeling\r\nin his trouser-pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can investigate the details later\xe2\x80\x94and I will\r\ngive him a ru\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him time. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s fond of the lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor, half\r\narresting the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s motion.\r\n\r\nThe lama dragged forth his rosary and pulled his huge hat-brim over his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he want now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim put up one hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says: \xe2\x80\x98Be quiet.\xe2\x80\x99 He wants to speak\r\nto me by himself. You see, you do not know one little word of what he\r\nsays, and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you very bad curses.\r\nWhen he takes those beads like that, you see, he always wants to be\r\nquiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two Englishmen sat overwhelmed, but there was a look in Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye that promised ill for Kim when he should be relaxed to the\r\nreligious arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Sahib and the son of a Sahib\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The lama\xe2\x80\x99s voice was harsh with pain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no white man knows the land and the customs of the land as thou\r\nknowest. How comes it this is true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matter, Holy One?\xe2\x80\x94but remember it is only for a night or two.\r\nRemember, I can change swiftly. It will all be as it was when I first\r\nspoke to thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a boy in the dress of white men\xe2\x80\x94when I first went to the Wonder\r\nHouse. And a second time thou wast a Hindu. What shall the third\r\nincarnation be?\xe2\x80\x9d He chuckled drearily. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, _chela_, thou has done a\r\nwrong to an old man because my heart went out to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine to thee. But how could I know that the Red Bull would bring\r\nme to this business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama covered his face afresh, and nervously rattled the rosary. Kim\r\nsquatted beside him and laid hold upon a fold of his clothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it is understood that the boy is a Sahib?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in a muffled\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a Sahib as was he who kept the images in the Wonder House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe lama\xe2\x80\x99s experience of white men was limited. He seemed to be\r\nrepeating a lesson. \xe2\x80\x9cSo then it is not seemly that he should do other\r\nthan as the Sahibs do. He must go back to his own people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a day and a night and a day,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ye don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d Father Victor saw Kim edging towards the door, and\r\ninterposed a strong leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand the customs of white men. The Priest of the Images\r\nin the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than the thin one\r\nhere. This boy will be taken from me. They will make a Sahib of my\r\ndisciple? Woe to me! How shall I find my River? Have _they_ no\r\ndisciples? Ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he is very sorree that he cannot find the River now any more.\r\nHe says, Why have you no disciples, and stop bothering him? He wants to\r\nbe washed of his sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither Bennett nor Father Victor found any answer ready.\r\n\r\nSaid Kim in English, distressed for the lama\xe2\x80\x99s agony: \xe2\x80\x9cI think if you\r\nwill let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal. We will\r\nlook for that River like before I was caught. I wish I did not come\r\nhere to find the Red Bull and all that sort of thing. I do not want\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the very best day\xe2\x80\x99s work you ever did for yourself, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bennett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to console him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor,\r\nwatching the lama intently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t take the boy away with him, and\r\nyet he\xe2\x80\x99s a good man\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s a good man. Bennett, if you give him\r\nthat rupee he\xe2\x80\x99ll curse you root and branch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey listened to each other\xe2\x80\x99s breathing\xe2\x80\x94three\xe2\x80\x94five full minutes. Then\r\nthe lama raised his head, and looked forth across them into space and\r\nemptiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am a Follower of the Way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sin is mine\r\nand the punishment is mine. I made believe to myself for now I see it\r\nwas but make-belief\xe2\x80\x94that thou wast sent to me to aid in the Search. So\r\nmy heart went out to thee for thy charity and thy courtesy and the\r\nwisdom of thy little years. But those who follow the Way must permit\r\nnot the fire of any desire or attachment, for that is all Illusion. As\r\nsays ...\xe2\x80\x9d He quoted an old, old Chinese text, backed it with another,\r\nand reinforced these with a third. \xe2\x80\x9cI stepped aside from the Way, my\r\n_chela_. It was no fault of thine. I delighted in the sight of life,\r\nthe new people upon the roads, and in thy joy at seeing these things. I\r\nwas pleased with thee who should have considered my Search and my\r\nSearch alone. Now I am sorrowful because thou art taken away and my\r\nRiver is far from me. It is the Law which I have broken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPowers of Darkness below!\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor, who, wise in the\r\nconfessional, heard the pain in every sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see now that the sign of the Red Bull was a sign for me as well as\r\nfor thee. All Desire is red\xe2\x80\x94and evil. I will do penance and find my\r\nRiver alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least go back to the Kulu woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise thou wilt be\r\nlost upon the roads. She will feed thee till I run back to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama waved a hand to show that the matter was finally settled in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his tone altered as he turned to Kim,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat will they do with\r\nthee? At least I may, acquiring merit, wipe out past ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake me a Sahib\xe2\x80\x94so they think. The day after tomorrow I return. Do not\r\ngrieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what sort? Such an one as this or that man?\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to Father\r\nVictor. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch an one as those I saw this evening, men wearing swords\r\nand stamping heavily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not well. These men follow desire and come to emptiness. Thou\r\nmust not be of their sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Umballa priest said that my Star was War,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim interjected. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill ask these fools\xe2\x80\x94but there is truly no need. I will run away this\r\nnight, for all I wanted to see the new things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim put two or three questions in English to Father Victor, translating\r\nthe replies to the lama.\r\n\r\nThen: \xe2\x80\x9cHe says, \xe2\x80\x98You take him from me and you cannot say what you will\r\nmake him.\xe2\x80\x99 He says, \xe2\x80\x98Tell me before I go, for it is not a small thing\r\nto make a child.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be sent to a school. Later on, we shall see. Kimball, I\r\nsuppose you\xe2\x80\x99d like to be a soldier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Gorah-log_ (white-folk). No-ah! No-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim shook his head violently.\r\nThere was nothing in his composition to which drill and routine\r\nappealed. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not be a soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be what you\xe2\x80\x99re told to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bennett; \xe2\x80\x9cand you should be\r\ngrateful that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim smiled compassionately. If these men lay under the delusion that he\r\nwould do anything that he did not fancy, so much the better.\r\n\r\nAnother long silence followed. Bennett fidgeted with impatience, and\r\nsuggested calling a sentry to evict the _faquir_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they give or sell learning among the Sahibs? Ask them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlama, and Kim interpreted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say that money is paid to the teacher\xe2\x80\x94but that money the Regiment\r\nwill give ... What need? It is only for a night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94the more money is paid the better learning is given?\xe2\x80\x9d The lama\r\ndisregarded Kim\xe2\x80\x99s plans for an early flight. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no wrong to pay for\r\nlearning. To help the ignorant to wisdom is always a merit.\xe2\x80\x9d The rosary\r\nclicked furiously as an abacus. Then he faced his oppressors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk them for how much money do they give a wise and suitable teaching?\r\nAnd in what city is that teaching given?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor in English, when Kim had translated, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\ndepends. The Regiment would pay for you all the time you are at the\r\nMilitary Orphanage; or you might go on the Punjab Masonic Orphanage\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlist (not that he or you \xe2\x80\x99ud understand what that means); but the best\r\nschooling a boy can get in India is, of course, at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nPartibus at Lucknow.\xe2\x80\x9d This took some time to interpret, for Bennett\r\nwished to cut it short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to know how much?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three hundred rupees a year.\xe2\x80\x9d Father Victor was long past any\r\nsense of amazement. Bennett, impatient, did not understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says: \xe2\x80\x98Write that name and the money upon a paper and give it him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd he says you must write your name below, because he is going to\r\nwrite a letter in some days to you. He says you are a good man. He says\r\nthe other man is a fool. He is going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama rose suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI follow my Search,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll run slap into the sentries,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Father Victor, jumping up as\r\nthe lama stalked out; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim made swift\r\nmotion to follow, but checked himself. There was no sound of challenge\r\noutside. The lama had disappeared.\r\n\r\nKim settled himself composedly on the Chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s cot. At least the lama\r\nhad promised that he would stay with the Raiput woman from Kulu, and\r\nthe rest was of the smallest importance. It pleased him that the two\r\npadres were so evidently excited. They talked long in undertones,\r\nFather Victor urging some scheme on Mr Bennett, who seemed incredulous.\r\nAll this was very new and fascinating, but Kim felt sleepy. They called\r\nmen into the tent\xe2\x80\x94one of them certainly was the Colonel, as his father\r\nhad prophesied\xe2\x80\x94and they asked him an infinity of questions, chiefly\r\nabout the woman who looked after him, all of which Kim answered\r\ntruthfully. They did not seem to think the woman a good guardian.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this was the newest of his experiences. Sooner or later, if\r\nhe chose, he could escape into great, grey, formless India, beyond\r\ntents and padres and colonels. Meantime, if the Sahibs were to be\r\nimpressed, he would do his best to impress them. He too was a white\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAfter much talk that he could not comprehend, they handed him over to a\r\nsergeant, who had strict instructions not to let him escape. The\r\nRegiment would go on to Umballa, and Kim would be sent up, partly at\r\nthe expense of the Lodge and in part by subscription, to a place called\r\nSanawar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s miraculous past all whooping, Colonel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor, when\r\nhe had talked without a break for ten minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cHis Buddhist friend has\r\nlevanted after taking my name and address. I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite make out\r\nwhether he\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for the boy\xe2\x80\x99s education or whether he is preparing\r\nsome sort of witchcraft on his own account.\xe2\x80\x9d Then to Kim: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll live\r\nto be grateful to your friend the Red Bull yet. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make a man of you\r\nat Sanawar\xe2\x80\x94even at the price o\xe2\x80\x99 making you a Protestant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94most certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bennett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will not go to Sanawar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we will go to Sanawar, little man. That\xe2\x80\x99s the order of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, who\xe2\x80\x99s a trifle more important than O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not go to Sanawar. You will go to thee War.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a shout of laughter from the full tent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you know your own Regiment a trifle better you won\xe2\x80\x99t confuse the\r\nline of march with line of battle, Kim. We hope to go to \xe2\x80\x98thee War\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsometime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah, I know all thatt.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim drew his bow again at a venture. If they\r\nwere not going to the war, at least they did not know what he knew of\r\nthe talk in the veranda at Umballa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you are not at thee war now; but I tell _you_ that as soon as\r\nyou get to Umballa you will be sent to the war\xe2\x80\x94the new war. It is a war\r\nof eight thousand men, besides the guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s explicit. D\xe2\x80\x99you add prophecy to your other gifts? Take him\r\nalong, sergeant. Take up a suit for him from the Drums, an\xe2\x80\x99 take care\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t slip through your fingers. Who says the age of miracles is\r\ngone by? I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed. My poor mind\xe2\x80\x99s weakening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the far end of the camp, silent as a wild animal, an hour later sat\r\nKim, newly washed all over, in a horrible stiff suit that rasped his\r\narms and legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most amazin\xe2\x80\x99 young bird,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cHe turns up in charge\r\nof a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest, with his father\xe2\x80\x99s Lodge\r\ncertificates round his neck, talkin\xe2\x80\x99 God knows what all of a red bull.\r\nThe buck-Brahmin evaporates without explanations, an\xe2\x80\x99 the bhoy sets\r\ncross-legged on the Chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s bed prophesyin\xe2\x80\x99 bloody war to the men at\r\nlarge. Injia\xe2\x80\x99s a wild land for a God-fearin\xe2\x80\x99 man. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tie his leg\r\nto the tent-pole in case he\xe2\x80\x99ll go through the roof. What did ye say\r\nabout the war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight thousand men, besides guns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cVery soon you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a consolin\xe2\x80\x99 little imp. Lie down between the Drums an\xe2\x80\x99 go to\r\nbye-bye. Those two boys will watch your slumbers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I remember comrades\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Old playmates on new seas\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWhenas we traded orpiment\r\n    Among the savages.\r\nTen thousand leagues to southward,\r\n    And thirty years removed\xe2\x80\x94\r\nThey knew not noble Valdez,\r\n    But me they knew and loved.\r\n\r\n_Song of Diego Valdez._\r\n\r\nVery early in the morning the white tents came down and disappeared as\r\nthe Mavericks took a side-road to Umballa. It did not skirt the\r\nresting-place, and Kim, trudging beside a baggage-cart under fire of\r\ncomments from soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 wives, was not so confident as overnight. He\r\ndiscovered that he was closely watched\xe2\x80\x94Father Victor on the one side,\r\nand Mr Bennett on the other.\r\n\r\nIn the forenoon the column checked. A camel-orderly handed the Colonel\r\na letter. He read it, and spoke to a Major. Half a mile in the rear,\r\nKim heard a hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on him through the\r\nthick dust. Then someone beat him on the back, crying: \xe2\x80\x9cTell us how ye\r\nknew, ye little limb of Satan? Father dear, see if ye can make him\r\ntell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pony ranged alongside, and he was hauled on to the priest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaddlebow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my son, your prophecy of last night has come true. Our orders are\r\nto entrain at Umballa for the Front tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is thatt?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, for \xe2\x80\x9c_front_\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_entrain_\xe2\x80\x9d were newish\r\nwords to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to \xe2\x80\x98thee War,\xe2\x80\x99 as you called it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you are going to thee War. I said last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe did; but, Powers o\xe2\x80\x99 Darkness, how did ye know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled. He shut his lips, nodded his head, and looked\r\nunspeakable things. The Chaplain moved on through the dust, and\r\nprivates, sergeants, and subalterns called one another\xe2\x80\x99s attention to\r\nthe boy. The Colonel, at the head of the column, stared at him\r\ncuriously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was probably some bazar rumour.\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut even\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He referred to the paper in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHang it all, the thing\r\nwas only decided within the last forty-eight hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there many more like you in India?\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor, \xe2\x80\x9cor are\r\nyou by way o\xe2\x80\x99 being a _lusus natur\xc3\xa6?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I have told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you let me go back to my old\r\nman? If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he\r\nwill die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what I saw of him he\xe2\x80\x99s as well able to take care of himself as you.\r\nNo. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ve brought us luck, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to make a man of you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake ye back to your baggage-cart and ye\xe2\x80\x99ll come to me this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of distinguished\r\nconsideration among a few hundred white men. The story of his\r\nappearance in camp, the discovery of his parentage, and his prophecy,\r\nhad lost nothing in the telling. A big, shapeless white woman on a pile\r\nof bedding asked him mysteriously whether he thought her husband would\r\ncome back from the war. Kim reflected gravely, and said that he would,\r\nand the woman gave him food. In many respects, this big procession that\r\nplayed music at intervals\xe2\x80\x94this crowd that talked and laughed so\r\neasily\xe2\x80\x94resembled a festival in Lahore city. So far, there was no sign\r\nof hard work, and he resolved to lend the spectacle his patronage. At\r\nevening there came out to meet them bands of music, and played the\r\nMavericks into camp near Umballa railway station. That was an\r\ninteresting night. Men of other regiments came to visit the Mavericks.\r\nThe Mavericks went visiting on their own account. Their pickets hurried\r\nforth to bring them back, met pickets of strange regiments on the same\r\nduty; and, after a while, the bugles blew madly for more pickets with\r\nofficers to control the tumult. The Mavericks had a reputation for\r\nliveliness to live up to. But they fell in on the platform next morning\r\nin perfect shape and condition; and Kim, left behind with the sick,\r\nwomen, and boys, found himself shouting farewells excitedly as the\r\ntrains drew away. Life as a Sahib was amusing so far; but he touched it\r\nwith a cautious hand. Then they marched him back in charge of a\r\ndrummer-boy to empty, lime-washed barracks, whose floors were covered\r\nwith rubbish and string and paper, and whose ceilings gave back his\r\nlonely footfall. Native-fashion, he curled himself up on a stripped cot\r\nand went to sleep. An angry man stumped down the veranda, woke him up,\r\nand said he was a schoolmaster. This was enough for Kim, and he retired\r\ninto his shell. He could just puzzle out the various English Police\r\nnotices in Lahore city, because they affected his comfort; and among\r\nthe many guests of the woman who looked after him had been a queer\r\nGerman who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling theatre. He told\r\nKim that he had been \xe2\x80\x9con the barricades in \xe2\x80\x9cForty-eight,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ntherefore\xe2\x80\x94at least that was how it struck Kim\xe2\x80\x94he would teach the boy to\r\nwrite in return for food. Kim had been kicked as far as single letters,\r\nbut did not think well of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know anything. Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, scenting evil. Hereupon\r\nthe man caught him by the ear, dragged him to a room in a far-off wing\r\nwhere a dozen drummer-boys were sitting on forms, and told him to be\r\nstill if he could do nothing else. This he managed very successfully.\r\nThe man explained something or other with white lines on a black board\r\nfor at least half an hour, and Kim continued his interrupted nap. He\r\nmuch disapproved of the present aspect of affairs, for this was the\r\nvery school and discipline he had spent two-thirds of his young life in\r\navoiding. Suddenly a beautiful idea occurred to him, and he wondered\r\nthat he had not thought of it before.\r\n\r\nThe man dismissed them, and first to spring through the veranda into\r\nthe open sunshine was Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Ere, you! \xe2\x80\x99Alt! Stop!\xe2\x80\x9d said a high voice at his heels. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nlook after you. My orders are not to let you out of my sight. Where are\r\nyou goin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the drummer-boy who had been hanging round him all the\r\nforenoon\xe2\x80\x94a fat and freckled person of about fourteen, and Kim loathed\r\nhim from the soles of his boots to his cap-ribbons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the bazar\xe2\x80\x94to get sweets\xe2\x80\x94for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, after thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the bazar\xe2\x80\x99s out o\xe2\x80\x99 bounds. If we go there we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a\r\ndressing-down. You come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow near can we go?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim did not know what bounds meant, but he wished\r\nto be polite\xe2\x80\x94for the present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Ow near? \xe2\x80\x99Ow far, you mean! We can go as far as that tree down the\r\nroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s too \xe2\x80\x99ot. I can watch you from \xe2\x80\x99ere.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good your runninv away. If you did, they\xe2\x80\x99d spot you by your\r\nclothes. That\xe2\x80\x99s regimental stuff you\xe2\x80\x99re wearin\xe2\x80\x99. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a picket\r\nin Umballa wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ead you back quicker than you started out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his raiment\r\nwould tire him out if he tried to run. He slouched to the tree at the\r\ncorner of a bare road leading towards the bazar, and eyed the natives\r\npassing. Most of them were barrack-servants of the lowest caste. Kim\r\nhailed a sweeper, who promptly retorted with a piece of unnecessary\r\ninsolence, in the natural belief that the European boy could not follow\r\nit. The low, quick answer undeceived him. Kim put his fettered soul\r\ninto it, thankful for the late chance to abuse somebody in the tongue\r\nhe knew best. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, go to the nearest letter-writer in the bazar\r\nand tell him to come here. I would write a letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but what manner of white man\xe2\x80\x99s son art thou to need a bazar\r\nletter-writer? Is there not a schoolmaster in the barracks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; and Hell is full of the same sort. Do my order, you\xe2\x80\x94you Od! Thy\r\nmother was married under a basket! Servant of Lal Beg\xe2\x80\x9d (Kim knew the\r\nGod of the sweepers), \xe2\x80\x9crun on my business or we will talk again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sweeper shuffled off in haste. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a white boy by the\r\nbarracks waiting under a tree who is not a white boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered to\r\nthe first bazar letter-writer he came across. \xe2\x80\x9cHe needs thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he pay?\xe2\x80\x9d said the spruce scribe, gathering up his desk and pens\r\nand sealing-wax all in order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. He is not like other boys. Go and see. It is well\r\nworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim danced with impatience when the slim young Kayeth hove in sight. As\r\nsoon as his voice could carry he cursed him volubly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst I will take my pay,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter-writer said. \xe2\x80\x9cBad words have\r\nmade the price higher. But who art thou, dressed in that fashion, to\r\nspeak in this fashion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! That is in the letter which thou shalt write. Never was such a\r\ntale. But I am in no haste. Another writer will serve me. Umballa city\r\nis as full of them as is Lahore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour annas,\xe2\x80\x9d said the writer, sitting down and spreading his cloth in\r\nthe shade of a deserted barrack-wing.\r\n\r\nMechanically Kim squatted beside him\xe2\x80\x94squatted as only the natives\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x94in spite of the abominable clinging trousers.\r\n\r\nThe writer regarded him sideways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the price to ask of Sahibs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cNow fix me a true\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn anna and a half. How do I know, having written the letter, that\r\nthou wilt not run away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI must not go beyond this tree, and there is also the stamp to be\r\nconsidered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI get no commission on the price of the stamp. Once more, what manner\r\nof white boy art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shall be said in the letter, which is to Mahbub Ali, the\r\nhorse-dealer in the Kashmir Serai, at Lahore. He is my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder on wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the letter-writer, dipping a reed in the\r\ninkstand. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be written in Hindi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly. To Mahbub Ali then. Begin! _I have come down with the old\r\nman as far as Umballa in the train. At Umballa I carried the news of\r\nthe bay mare\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree._\xe2\x80\x9d After what he had seen in the garden, he was\r\nnot going to write of white stallions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlower a little. What has a bay mare to do ... Is it Mahbub Ali, the\r\ngreat dealer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho else? I have been in his service. Take more ink. Again. _As the\r\norder was, so I did it. We then went on foot towards Benares, but on\r\nthe third day we found a certain regiment._ Is that down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, _pulton_,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the writer, all ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I went into their camp and was caught, and by means of the charm\r\nabout my neck, which thou knowest, it was established that I was the\r\nson of some man in the regiment: according to the prophecy of the Red\r\nBull, which thou knowest was common talk of our bazar._\xe2\x80\x9d Kim waited for\r\nthis shaft to sink into the letter-writer\xe2\x80\x99s heart, cleared his throat,\r\nand continued: \xe2\x80\x9c_A priest clothed me and gave me a new name ... One\r\npriest, however, was a fool. The clothes are very heavy, but I am a\r\nSahib and my heart is heavy too. They send me to a school and beat me.\r\nI do not like the air and water here. Come then and help me, Mahbub\r\nAli, or send me some money, for I have not sufficient to pay the writer\r\nwho writes this._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who writes this.\xe2\x80\x99 It is my own fault that I was tricked. Thou art as\r\nclever as Husain Bux that forged the Treasury stamps at Nucklao. But\r\nwhat a tale! What a tale! Is it true by any chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not profit to tell lies to Mahbub Ali. It is better to help\r\nhis friends by lending them a stamp. When the money comes I will\r\nrepay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe writer grunted doubtfully, but took a stamp out of his desk, sealed\r\nthe letter, handed it over to Kim, and departed. Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s was a\r\nname of power in Umballa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the way to win a good account with the Gods,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim shouted\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay me twice over when the money comes,\xe2\x80\x9d the man cried over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was you bukkin\xe2\x80\x99 to that nigger about?\xe2\x80\x9d said the drummer-boy when\r\nKim returned to the veranda. \xe2\x80\x9cI was watch-in\xe2\x80\x99 you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk the same as a nigger, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-ah! No-ah! I onlee speak a little. What shall we do now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bugles\xe2\x80\x99ll go for dinner in arf a minute. My Gawd! I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d gone\r\nup to the Front with the Regiment. It\xe2\x80\x99s awful doin\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but school\r\ndown \xe2\x80\x99ere. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you \xe2\x80\x99ate it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah yess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d run away if I knew where to go to, but, as the men say, in this\r\nbloomin\xe2\x80\x99 Injia you\xe2\x80\x99re only a prisoner at large. You can\xe2\x80\x99t desert\r\nwithout bein\xe2\x80\x99 took back at once. I\xe2\x80\x99m fair sick of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been in Be\xe2\x80\x94England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x99y, I only come out last troopin\xe2\x80\x99 season with my mother. I should\r\nthink I \xe2\x80\x99ave been in England. What a ignorant little beggar you are!\r\nYou was brought up in the gutter, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah yess. Tell me something about England. My father he came from\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough he would not say so, Kim of course disbelieved every word the\r\ndrummer-boy spoke about the Liverpool suburb which was his England. It\r\npassed the heavy time till dinner\xe2\x80\x94a most unappetizing meal served to\r\nthe boys and a few invalids in a corner of a barrack-room. But that he\r\nhad written to Mahbub Ali, Kim would have been almost depressed. The\r\nindifference of native crowds he was used to; but this strong\r\nloneliness among white men preyed on him. He was grateful when, in the\r\ncourse of the afternoon, a big soldier took him over to Father Victor,\r\nwho lived in another wing across another dusty parade-ground. The\r\npriest was reading an English letter written in purple ink. He looked\r\nat Kim more curiously than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 how do you like it, my son, as far as you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone? Not much, eh?\r\nIt must be hard\xe2\x80\x94very hard on a wild animal. Listen now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve an amazin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nepistle from your friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he? Is he well? Oah! If he knows to write me letters, it is\r\nall right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re fond of him then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Of_ course I am fond of him. He was fond of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so by the look of this. He can\xe2\x80\x99t write English, can he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah no. Not that I know, but _of_ course he found a letter-writer who\r\ncan write English verree well, and so he wrote. I do hope you\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat accounts for it. D\xe2\x80\x99you know anything about his money affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nKim\xe2\x80\x99s face showed that he did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m askin\xe2\x80\x99. Now listen if you can make head or tail o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthis. We\xe2\x80\x99ll skip the first part ... It\xe2\x80\x99s written from Jagadhir Road ...\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Sitting on wayside in grave meditation, trusting to be favoured with\r\nyour Honour\xe2\x80\x99s applause of present step, which recommend your Honour to\r\nexecute for Almighty God\xe2\x80\x99s sake.

If he says so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest whistled; then he addressed Kim as an equal. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it; but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. You were goin\xe2\x80\x99 off today to the Military\r\nOrphanage at Sanawar, where the Regiment would keep you till you were\r\nold enough to enlist. Ye\xe2\x80\x99d be brought up to the Church of England.\r\nBennett arranged for that. On the other hand, if ye go to St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nye\xe2\x80\x99ll get a better education an\xe2\x80\x94an can have the religion. D\xe2\x80\x99ye see my\r\ndilemma?

If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, ye\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Military\r\nOrphanage at the Regiment\xe2\x80\x99s expense. I\xe2\x80\x99ll allow him three days\xe2\x80\x99 grace,\r\nthough I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it at all. Even then, if he fails in his\r\npayments later on ... but it\xe2\x80\x99s beyond me. We can only walk one step at\r\na time in this world, praise God! An\xe2\x80\x99 they sent Bennett to the Front\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 left me behind. Bennett can\xe2\x80\x99t expect everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah yess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim vaguely.\r\n\r\nThe priest leaned forward. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give a month\xe2\x80\x99s pay to find what\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\non inside that little round head of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, and scratched it. He was wondering\r\nwhether Mahbub Ali would send him as much as a whole rupee. Then he\r\ncould pay the letter-writer and write letters to the lama at Benares.\r\nPerhaps Mahbub Ali would visit him next time he came south with horses.\r\nSurely he must know that Kim\xe2\x80\x99s delivery of the letter to the officer at\r\nUmballa had caused the great war which the men and boys had discussed\r\nso loudly over the barrack dinner-tables. But if Mahbub Ali did not\r\nknow this, it would be very unsafe to tell him so. Mahbub Ali was hard\r\nupon boys who knew, or thought they knew, too much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, till I get further news\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Father Victor\xe2\x80\x99s voice interrupted the\r\nreverie. \xe2\x80\x9cYe can run along now and play with the other boys. They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nteach ye something\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think ye\xe2\x80\x99ll like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day dragged to its weary end. When he wished to sleep he was\r\ninstructed how to fold up his clothes and set out his boots; the other\r\nboys deriding. Bugles waked him in the dawn; the schoolmaster caught\r\nhim after breakfast, thrust a page of meaningless characters under his\r\nnose, gave them senseless names and whacked him without reason. Kim\r\nmeditated poisoning him with opium borrowed from a barrack-sweeper, but\r\nreflected that, as they all ate at one table in public (this was\r\npeculiarly revolting to Kim, who preferred to turn his back on the\r\nworld at meals), the stroke might be dangerous. Then he attempted\r\nrunning off to the village where the priest had tried to drug the\r\nlama\xe2\x80\x94the village where the old soldier lived. But far-seeing sentries\r\nat every exit headed back the little scarlet figure. Trousers and\r\njacket crippled body and mind alike so he abandoned the project and\r\nfell back, Oriental-fashion, on time and chance. Three days of torment\r\npassed in the big, echoing white rooms. He walked out of afternoons\r\nunder escort of the drummer-boy, and all he heard from his companions\r\nwere the few useless words which seemed to make two-thirds of the white\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s abuse. Kim knew and despised them all long ago. The boy resented\r\nhis silence and lack of interest by beating him, as was only natural.\r\nHe did not care for any of the bazars which were in bounds. He styled\r\nall natives \xe2\x80\x9cniggers\xe2\x80\x9d; yet servants and sweepers called him abominable\r\nnames to his face, and, misled by their deferential attitude, he never\r\nunderstood. This somewhat consoled Kim for the beatings.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day a judgement overtook that drummer.\r\nThey had gone out together towards Umballa racecourse. He returned\r\nalone, weeping, with news that young O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, to whom he had been doing\r\nnothing in particular, had hailed a scarlet-bearded nigger on\r\nhorseback; that the nigger had then and there laid into him with a\r\npeculiarly adhesive quirt, picked up young O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, and borne him off at\r\nfull gallop. These tidings came to Father Victor, and he drew down his\r\nlong upper lip. He was already sufficiently startled by a letter from\r\nthe Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares, enclosing a native banker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnote of hand for three hundred rupees, and an amazing prayer to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmighty God\xe2\x80\x9d. The lama would have been more annoyed than the priest\r\nhad he known how the bazar letter-writer had translated his phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nacquire merit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPowers of Darkness below!\xe2\x80\x9d Father Victor fumbled with the note. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnow he\xe2\x80\x99s off with another of his peep-o\xe2\x80\x99-day friends. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether it will be a greater relief to me to get him back or to have\r\nhim lost. He\xe2\x80\x99s beyond my comprehension. How the Divil\xe2\x80\x94yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s the man\r\nI mean\xe2\x80\x94can a street-beggar raise money to educate white boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree miles off, on Umballa racecourse, Mahbub Ali, reining a grey\r\nKabuli stallion with Kim in front of him, was saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Little Friend of all the World, there is _my_ honour and\r\nreputation to be considered. All the officer-Sahibs in all the\r\nregiments, and all Umballa, know Mahbub Ali. Men saw me pick thee up\r\nand chastise that boy. We are seen now from far across this plain. How\r\ncan I take thee away, or account for thy disappearing if I set thee\r\ndown and let thee run off into the crops? They would put me in jail. Be\r\npatient. Once a Sahib, always a Sahib. When thou art a man\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nknows?\xe2\x80\x94thou wilt be grateful to Mahbub Ali.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me beyond their sentries where I can change this red. Give me\r\nmoney and I will go to Benares and be with my lama again. I do not want\r\nto be a Sahib, and remember I did deliver that message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stallion bounded wildly. Mahbub Ali had incautiously driven home\r\nthe sharp-edged stirrup. (He was not the new sort of fluent\r\nhorse-dealer who wears English boots and spurs.) Kim drew his own\r\nconclusions from that betrayal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a small matter. It lay on the straight road to Benares. I and\r\nthe Sahib have by this time forgotten it. I send so many letters and\r\nmessages to men who ask questions about horses, I cannot well remember\r\none from the other. Was it some matter of a bay mare that Peters Sahib\r\nwished the pedigree of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim saw the trap at once. If he had said \xe2\x80\x9cbay mare\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub would have\r\nknown by his very readiness to fall in with the amendment that the boy\r\nsuspected something. Kim replied therefore:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBay mare. No. _I_ do not forget my messages thus. It was a white\r\nstallion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, so it was. A white Arab stallion. But thou didst write \xe2\x80\x98bay mare\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho cares to tell truth to a letter-writer?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim answered, feeling\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s palm on his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! Mahbub, you old villain, pull up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice, and an\r\nEnglishman raced alongside on a little polo-pony. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been chasing\r\nyou half over the country. That Kabuli of yours can go. For sale, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some young stuff coming on made by Heaven for the delicate and\r\ndifficult polo-game. He has no equal. He\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlays polo and waits at table. Yes. We know all that. What the deuce\r\nhave you got there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA. boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was being beaten by another boy. His\r\nfather was once a white soldier in the big war. The boy was a child in\r\nLahore city. He played with my horses when he was a babe. Now I think\r\nthey will make him a soldier. He has been newly caught by his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nRegiment that went up to the war last week. But I do not think he wants\r\nto be a soldier. I take him for a ride. Tell me where thy barracks are\r\nand I will set thee there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go. I can find the barracks alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if thou runnest away who will say it is not my fault?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll run back to his dinner. Where has he to run to?\xe2\x80\x9d the Englishman\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was born in the land. He has friends. He goes where he chooses. He\r\nis a _chabuk sawai_ (a sharp chap). It needs only to change his\r\nclothing, and in a twinkling he would be a low-caste Hindu boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce he would!\xe2\x80\x9d The Englishman looked critically at the boy as\r\nMahbub headed towards the barracks. Kim ground his teeth. Mahbub was\r\nmocking him, as faithless Afghans will; for he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will send him to a school and put heavy boots on his feet and\r\nswaddle him in these clothes. Then he will forget all he knows. Now,\r\nwhich of the barracks is thine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim pointed\xe2\x80\x94he could not speak\xe2\x80\x94to Father Victor\xe2\x80\x99s wing, all staring\r\nwhite near by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he will make a good soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub reflectively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will make a good orderly at least. I sent him to deliver a message\r\nonce from Lahore. A message concerning the pedigree of a white\r\nstallion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was deadly insult on deadlier injury\xe2\x80\x94and the Sahib to whom he had\r\nso craftily given that war-waking letter heard it all. Kim beheld\r\nMahbub Ali frying in flame for his treachery, but for himself he saw\r\none long grey vista of barracks, schools, and barracks again. He gazed\r\nimploringly at the clear-cut face in which there was no glimmer of\r\nrecognition; but even at this extremity it never occurred to him to\r\nthrow himself on the white man\xe2\x80\x99s mercy or to denounce the Afghan. And\r\nMahbub stared deliberately at the Englishman, who stared as\r\ndeliberately at Kim, quivering and tongue-tied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy horse is well trained,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dealer. \xe2\x80\x9cOthers would have kicked,\r\nSahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman at last, rubbing his pony\xe2\x80\x99s damp withers with\r\nhis whip-butt. \xe2\x80\x9cWho makes the boy a soldier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says the Regiment that found him, and especially the Padre-sahib of\r\nthat regiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the Padre!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim choked as bare-headed Father Victor sailed\r\ndown upon them from the veranda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPowers O\xe2\x80\x99 Darkness below, O\xe2\x80\x99Hara! How many more mixed friends do you\r\nkeep in Asia?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, as Kim slid down and stood helplessly before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Padre,\xe2\x80\x9d the Englishman said cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you by\r\nreputation well enough. Meant to have come over and called before this.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m Creighton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the Ethnological Survey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Victor. The Englishman\r\nnodded. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to meet ye then; an\xe2\x80\x99 I owe you some thanks for\r\nbringing back the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thanks to me, Padre. Besides, the boy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going away. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow old Mahbub Ali.\xe2\x80\x9d The horse-dealer sat impassive in the sunlight.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will when you have been in the station a month. He sells us all\r\nour crocks. That boy is rather a curiosity. Can you tell me anything\r\nabout him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d puffed Father Victor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be the one man that\r\ncould help me in my quandaries. Tell you! Powers o\xe2\x80\x99 Darkness, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbursting to tell someone who knows something o\xe2\x80\x99 the native!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA groom came round the corner. Colonel Creighton raised his voice,\r\nspeaking in Urdu. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Mahbub Ali, but what is the use of\r\ntelling me all those stories about the pony? Not one pice more than\r\nthree hundred and fifty rupees will I give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahib is a little hot and angry after riding,\xe2\x80\x9d the horse-dealer\r\nreturned, with the leer of a privileged jester. \xe2\x80\x9cPresently, he will see\r\nmy horse\xe2\x80\x99s points more clearly. I will wait till he has finished his\r\ntalk with the Padre. I will wait under that tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound you!\xe2\x80\x9d The Colonel laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat comes of looking at one of\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s horses. He\xe2\x80\x99s a regular old leech, Padre. Wait, then, if thou\r\nhast so much time to spare, Mahbub. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m at your service, Padre.\r\nWhere is the boy? Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone off to collogue with Mahbub. Queer sort\r\nof boy. Might I ask you to send my mare round under cover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped into a chair which commanded a clear view of Kim and Mahbub\r\nAli in conference beneath the tree. The Padre went indoors for\r\ncheroots.\r\n\r\nCreighton heard Kim say bitterly: \xe2\x80\x9cTrust a Brahmin before a snake, and\r\na snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all one.\xe2\x80\x9d The great red beard wagged solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cChildren\r\nshould not see a carpet on the loom till the pattern is made plain.\r\nBelieve me, Friend of all the World, I do thee great service. They will\r\nnot make a soldier of thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou crafty old sinner!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Creighton. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re not far wrong.\r\nThat boy mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be wasted if he is as advertised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me half a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Padre from within, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngettin\xe2\x80\x99 the documents in the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf through me the favour of this bold and wise Colonel Sahib comes to\r\nthee, and thou art raised to honour, what thanks wilt thou give Mahbub\r\nAli when thou art a man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay! I begged thee to let me take the Road again, where I should\r\nhave been safe; and thou hast sold me back to the English. What will\r\nthey give thee for blood-money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cheerful young demon!\xe2\x80\x9d The Colonel bit his cigar, and turned\r\npolitely to Father Victor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are the letters that the fat priest is waving before the Colonel?\r\nStand behind the stallion as though looking at my bridle!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub\r\nAli.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter from my lama which he wrote from Jagadhir Road, saying that\r\nhe will pay three hundred rupees by the year for my schooling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! Is old Red Hat of that sort? At which school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows. I think in Nucklao.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. There is a big school there for the sons of Sahibs\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhalf-Sahibs. I have seen it when I sell horses there. So the lama also\r\nloved the Friend of all the World?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; and _he_ did not tell lies, or return me to captivity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmall wonder the Padre does not know how to unravel the thread. How\r\nfast he talks to the Colonel Sahib!\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub Ali chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Allah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe keen eyes swept the veranda for an Instant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthy lama has sent what\r\nto me looks like a note of hand. I have had some few dealings in\r\n_hoondies_. The Colonel Sahib is looking at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good is all this to me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt go away,\r\nand they will return me to those empty rooms where there is no good\r\nplace to sleep and where the boys beat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think that. Have patience, child. All Pathans are not\r\nfaithless\xe2\x80\x94except in horseflesh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive\xe2\x80\x94ten\xe2\x80\x94fifteen minutes passed, Father Victor talking energetically or\r\nasking questions which the Colonel answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you everything that I know about the boy from beginnin\r\nto end; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a blessed relief to me. Did ye ever hear the like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, the old man has sent the money. Gobind Sahai\xe2\x80\x99s notes of\r\nhand are good from here to China,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more one\r\nknows about natives the less can one say what they will or won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s consolin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94from the head of the Ethnological Survey. It\xe2\x80\x99s this\r\nmixture of Red Bulls and Rivers of Healing (poor heathen, God help\r\nhim!) an\xe2\x80\x99 notes of hand and Masonic certificates. Are you a Mason, by\r\nany chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, I am, now I come to think of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s an additional\r\nreason,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad ye see a reason in it. But as I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s the mixture o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthings that\xe2\x80\x99s beyond me. An\xe2\x80\x99 his prophesyin\xe2\x80\x99 to our Colonel, sitting on\r\nmy bed with his little shimmy torn open showing his white skin; an\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nprophecy comin\xe2\x80\x99 true! They\xe2\x80\x99ll cure all that nonsense at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSprinkle him with holy water,\xe2\x80\x9d the Colonel laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word, I fancy I ought to sometimes. But I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping he\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nbrought up as a good Catholic. All that troubles me is what\xe2\x80\x99ll happen\r\nif the old beggar-man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLama, lama, my dear sir; and some of them are gentlemen in their own\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lama, then, fails to pay next year. He\xe2\x80\x99s a fine business head to\r\nplan on the spur of the moment, but he\xe2\x80\x99s bound to die some day. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntakin\xe2\x80\x99 a heathen\xe2\x80\x99s money to give a child a Christian education\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he said explicitly what he wanted. As soon as he knew the boy was\r\nwhite he seems to have made his arrangements accordingly. I\xe2\x80\x99d give a\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x99s pay to hear how he explained it all at the Tirthankars\xe2\x80\x99 Temple\r\nat Benares. Look here, Padre, I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know much about\r\nnatives, but if he says he\xe2\x80\x99ll pay, he\xe2\x80\x99ll pay\xe2\x80\x94dead or alive. I mean, his\r\nheirs will assume the debt. My advice to you is, send the boy down to\r\nLucknow. If your Anglican Chaplain thinks you\xe2\x80\x99ve stolen a march on\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad luck to Bennett! He was sent to the Front instead o\xe2\x80\x99 me. Doughty\r\ncertified me medically unfit. I\xe2\x80\x99ll excommunicate Doughty if he comes\r\nback alive! Surely Bennett ought to be content with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory, leaving you the religion. Quite so! As a matter of fact I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink Bennett will mind. Put the blame on me. I\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94strongly recommend\r\nsending the boy to St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s. He can go down on pass as a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norphan, so the railway fare will be saved. You can buy him an outfit\r\nfrom the Regimental subscription. The Lodge will be saved the expense\r\nof his education, and that will put the Lodge in a good temper. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfectly easy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go down to Lucknow next week. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look\r\nafter the boy on the way\xe2\x80\x94give him in charge of my servants, and so on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make that mistake. The lama has sent us money\r\nfor a definite end. We can\xe2\x80\x99t very well return it. We shall have to do\r\nas he says. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s settled, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Shall we say that, Tuesday\r\nnext, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hand him over to me at the night train south? That\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthree days. He can\xe2\x80\x99t do much harm in three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a weight off my mind, but\xe2\x80\x94this thing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he waved the note of\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know Gobind Sahai: or his bank, which may be a hole in a\r\nwall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a subaltern in debt. I\xe2\x80\x99ll cash it if you like, and\r\nsend you the vouchers in proper order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with all your own work too! It\xe2\x80\x99s askin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the least trouble indeed. You see, as an ethnologist, the\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting to me. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to make a note of it for some\r\nGovernment work that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. The transformation of a regimental\r\nbadge like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is\r\nvery interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t thank you enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing you can do. All we Ethnological men are as jealous\r\nas jackdaws of one another\xe2\x80\x99s discoveries. They\xe2\x80\x99re of no interest to\r\nanyone but ourselves, of course, but you know what book-collectors are\r\nlike. Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word, directly or indirectly, about the Asiatic\r\nside of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s character\xe2\x80\x94his adventures and his prophecy, and so on.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll worm them out of the boy later on and\xe2\x80\x94you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll make a wonderful account of it. Never a word will I say to\r\nanyone till I see it in print.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. That goes straight to an ethnologist\xe2\x80\x99s heart. Well, I must\r\nbe getting back to my breakfast. Good Heavens! Old Mahbub here still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe raised his voice, and the horse-dealer came out from under the\r\nshadow of the tree, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs regards that young horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub, \xe2\x80\x9cI say that when a colt is\r\nborn to be a polo-pony, closely following the ball without\r\nteaching\xe2\x80\x94when such a colt knows the game by divination\xe2\x80\x94then I say it is\r\na great wrong to break that colt to a heavy cart, Sahib!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo say I also, Mahbub. The colt will be entered for polo only. (These\r\nfellows think of nothing in the world but horses, Padre.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you\r\ntomorrow, Mahbub, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve anything likely for sale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dealer saluted, horseman-fashion, with a sweep of the off hand. \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\npatient a little, Friend of all the World,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to the\r\nagonized Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cThy fortune is made. In a little while thou goest to\r\nNucklao, and\xe2\x80\x94here is something to pay the letter-writer. I shall see\r\nthee again, I think, many times,\xe2\x80\x9d and he cantered off down the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel from the veranda, speaking in the\r\nvernacular. \xe2\x80\x9cIn three days thou wilt go with me to Lucknow, seeing and\r\nhearing new things all the while. Therefore sit still for three days\r\nand do not run away. Thou wilt go to school at Lucknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I meet my Holy One there?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim whimpered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least Lucknow is nearer to Benares than Umballa. It may be thou\r\nwilt go under my protection. Mahbub Ali knows this, and he will be\r\nangry if thou returnest to the Road now. Remember\xe2\x80\x94much has been told me\r\nwhich I do not forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the boys will beat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the bugles blew for dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nUnto whose use the pregnant suns are poised\r\n    With idiot moons and stars retracing stars?\r\nCreep thou betweene\xe2\x80\x94thy coming\xe2\x80\x99s all unnoised.\r\n    Heaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars.\r\nHeir to these tumults, this affright, that fraye\r\n(By Adam\xe2\x80\x99s, fathers\xe2\x80\x99, own, sin bound alway);\r\nPeer up, draw out thy horoscope and say\r\n    Which planet mends thy threadbare fate or mars!\r\n\r\nSir John Christie.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the red-faced schoolmaster told Kim that he had been\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstruck off the strength\xe2\x80\x9d, which conveyed no meaning to him till he was\r\nordered to go away and play. Then he ran to the bazar, and found the\r\nyoung letter-writer to whom he owed a stamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I pay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim royally, \xe2\x80\x9cand now I need another letter to be\r\nwritten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMahbub Ali is in Umballa,\xe2\x80\x9d said the writer jauntily. He was, by virtue\r\nof his office, a bureau of general misinformation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not to Mahbub, but to a priest. Take thy pen and write\r\nquickly. _To Teshoo Lama, the Holy One from Bhotiyal seeking for a\r\nRiver, who is now in the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares._ Take\r\nmore ink! _In three days I am to go down to Nucklao to the school at\r\nNucklao. The name of the school is Xavier. I do not know where that\r\nschool is, but it is at Nucklao._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know Nucklao,\xe2\x80\x9d the writer interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him where it is, and I give half an anna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reed pen scratched busily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d The man lifted his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cWho watches us across the street?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim looked up hurriedly and saw Colonel Creighton in tennis-flannels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is some Sahib who knows the fat priest in the barracks. He is\r\nbeckoning me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, when Kim trotted up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I am not running away. I send a letter to my Holy One at Benares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not thought of that. Hast thou said that I take thee to\r\nLucknow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I have not. Read the letter, if there be a doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why hast thou left out my name in writing to that Holy One?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nColonel smiled a queer smile. Kim took his courage in both hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was said once to me that it is inexpedient to write the names of\r\nstrangers concerned in any matter, because by the naming of names many\r\ngood plans are brought to confusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast been well taught,\xe2\x80\x9d the Colonel replied, and Kim flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave left my cheroot-case in the Padre\xe2\x80\x99s veranda. Bring it to my house\r\nthis even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the house?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. His quick wit told him that he was\r\nbeing tested in some fashion or another, and he stood on guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk anyone in the big bazar.\xe2\x80\x9d The Colonel walked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has forgotten his cheroot-case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, returning. \xe2\x80\x9cI must bring\r\nit to him this evening. That is all my letter except, thrice over,\r\n_Come to me! Come to me! Come to me!_ Now I will pay for a stamp and\r\nput it in the post. He rose to go, and as an afterthought asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nis that angry-faced Sahib who lost the cheroot-case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is only Creighton Sahib\xe2\x80\x94a very foolish Sahib, who is a Colonel\r\nSahib without a regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows. He is always buying horses which he cannot ride, and asking\r\nriddles about the works of God\xe2\x80\x94such as plants and stones and the\r\ncustoms of people. The dealers call him the father of fools, because he\r\nis so easily cheated about a horse. Mahbub Ali says he is madder than\r\nmost other Sahibs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, and departed. His training had given him some small\r\nknowledge of character, and he argued that fools are not given\r\ninformation which leads to calling out eight thousand men besides guns.\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief of all India does not talk, as Kim had heard him\r\ntalk, to fools. Nor would Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s tone have changed, as it did\r\nevery time he mentioned the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s name, if the Colonel had been a\r\nfool. Consequently\xe2\x80\x94and this set Kim to skipping\xe2\x80\x94there was a mystery\r\nsomewhere, and Mahbub Ali probably spied for the Colonel much as Kim\r\nhad spied for Mahbub. And, like the horse-dealer, the Colonel evidently\r\nrespected people who did not show themselves to be too clever.\r\n\r\nHe rejoiced that he had not betrayed his knowledge of the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; and when, on his return to barracks, he discovered that no\r\ncheroot-case had been left behind, he beamed with delight. Here was a\r\nman after his own heart\xe2\x80\x94a tortuous and indirect person playing a hidden\r\ngame. Well, if he could be a fool, so could Kim.\r\n\r\nHe showed nothing of his mind when Father Victor, for three long\r\nmornings, discoursed to him of an entirely new set of Gods and\r\nGodlings\xe2\x80\x94notably of a Goddess called Mary, who, he gathered, was one\r\nwith Bibi Miriam of Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s theology. He betrayed no emotion when,\r\nafter the lecture, Father Victor dragged him from shop to shop buying\r\narticles of outfit, nor when envious drummer-boys kicked him because he\r\nwas going to a superior school did he complain, but awaited the play of\r\ncircumstances with an interested soul. Father Victor, good man, took\r\nhim to the station, put him into an empty second-class next to Colonel\r\nCreighton\xe2\x80\x99s first, and bade him farewell with genuine feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll make a man o\xe2\x80\x99 you, O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a white man, an\xe2\x80\x99, I\r\nhope, a good man. They know all about your comin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 the Colonel will\r\nsee that ye\xe2\x80\x99re not lost or mislaid anywhere on the road. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you\r\na notion of religious matters,\xe2\x80\x94at least I hope so,\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember,\r\nwhen they ask you your religion, that you\xe2\x80\x99re a Cath\xe2\x80\x99lic. Better say\r\nRoman Cath\xe2\x80\x99lic, tho\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m not fond of the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim lit a rank cigarette\xe2\x80\x94he had been careful to buy a stock in the\r\nbazar\xe2\x80\x94and lay down to think. This solitary passage was very different\r\nfrom that joyful down-journey in the third-class with the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cSahibs\r\nget little pleasure of travel,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. \xe2\x80\x9c_Hai mai!_ I go from one\r\nplace to another as it might be a kickball. It is my _Kismet_. No man\r\ncan escape his _Kismet_. But I am to pray to Bibi Miriam, and I am a\r\nSahib.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at his boots ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I am Kim. This is the\r\ngreat world, and I am only Kim. Who is Kim?\xe2\x80\x9d He considered his own\r\nidentity, a thing he had never done before, till his head swam. He was\r\none insignificant person in all this roaring whirl of India, going\r\nsouthward to he knew not what fate.\r\n\r\nPresently the Colonel sent for him, and talked for a long time. So far\r\nas Kim could gather, he was to be diligent and enter the Survey of\r\nIndia as a chain-man. If he were very good, and passed the proper\r\nexaminations, he would be earning thirty rupees a month at seventeen\r\nyears old, and Colonel Creighton would see that he found suitable\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nKim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three of this\r\ntalk. Then the Colonel, seeing his mistake, turned to fluent and\r\npicturesque Urdu and Kim was contented. No man could be a fool who knew\r\nthe language so intimately, who moved so gently and silently, and whose\r\neyes were so different from the dull fat eyes of other Sahibs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and thou must learn how to make pictures of roads and mountains\r\nand rivers, to carry these pictures in thine eye till a suitable time\r\ncomes to set them upon paper. Perhaps some day, when thou art a\r\nchain-man, I may say to thee when we are working together: \xe2\x80\x98Go across\r\nthose hills and see what lies beyond.\xe2\x80\x99 Then one will say: \xe2\x80\x98There are\r\nbad people living in those hills who will slay the chain-man if he be\r\nseen to look like a Sahib.\xe2\x80\x99 What then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim thought. Would it be safe to return the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s lead?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would tell what that other man had said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I answered: \xe2\x80\x98I will give thee a hundred rupees for knowledge of\r\nwhat is behind those hills\xe2\x80\x94for a picture of a river and a little news\r\nof what the people say in the villages there\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell? I am only a boy. Wait till I am a man.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, seeing\r\nthe Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s brow clouded, he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I should in a few\r\ndays earn the hundred rupees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim shook his head resolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I said how I would earn them,\r\nanother man might hear and forestall me. It is not good to sell\r\nknowledge for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell now.\xe2\x80\x9d The Colonel held up a rupee. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s hand half reached\r\ntowards it, and dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Sahib; nay. I know the price that will be paid for the answer,\r\nbut I do not know why the question is asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it for a gift, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Creighton, tossing it over. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\na good spirit in thee. Do not let it be blunted at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s. There\r\nare many boys there who despise the black men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir mothers were bazar-women,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. He knew well there is no\r\nhatred like that of the half-caste for his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; but thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib. Therefore, do not\r\nat any time be led to contemn the black men. I have known boys newly\r\nentered into the service of the Government who feigned not to\r\nunderstand the talk or the customs of black men. Their pay was cut for\r\nignorance. There is no sin so great as ignorance. Remember this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral times in the course of the long twenty-four hours\xe2\x80\x99 run south\r\ndid the Colonel send for Kim, always developing this latter text.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe be all on one lead-rope, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Colonel,\r\nMahbub Ali, and I\xe2\x80\x94when I become a chain-man. He will use me as Mahbub\r\nAli employed me, I think. That is good, if it allows me to return to\r\nthe Road again. This clothing grows no easier by wear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the crowded Lucknow station there was no sign of the\r\nlama. He swallowed his disappointment, while the Colonel bundled him\r\ninto a _ticca-gharri_ with his neat belongings and despatched him alone\r\nto St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say farewell, because we shall meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAgain,\r\nand many times, if thou art one of good spirit. But thou art not yet\r\ntried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when I brought thee\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim actually dared to use the _tum_ of\r\nequals\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca white stallion\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree that night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch is gained by forgetting, little brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, with\r\na look that pierced through Kim\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder-blades as he scuttled into\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\nIt took him nearly five minutes to recover. Then he sniffed the new air\r\nappreciatively. \xe2\x80\x9cA rich city,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cRicher than Lahore. How good\r\nthe bazars must be! Coachman, drive me a little through the bazars\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy order is to take thee to the school.\xe2\x80\x9d The driver used the \xe2\x80\x9cthou\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\nwhich is rudeness when applied to a white man. In the clearest and most\r\nfluent vernacular Kim pointed out his error, climbed on to the\r\nbox-seat, and, perfect understanding established, drove for a couple of\r\nhours up and down, estimating, comparing, and enjoying. There is no\r\ncity\xe2\x80\x94except Bombay, the queen of all\xe2\x80\x94more beautiful in her garish style\r\nthan Lucknow, whether you see her from the bridge over the river, or\r\nfrom the top of the Imambara looking down on the gilt umbrellas of the\r\nChutter Munzil, and the trees in which the town is bedded. Kings have\r\nadorned her with fantastic buildings, endowed her with charities,\r\ncrammed her with pensioners, and drenched her with blood. She is the\r\ncentre of all idleness, intrigue, and luxury, and shares with Delhi the\r\nclaim to talk the only pure Urdu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fair city\xe2\x80\x94a beautiful city.\xe2\x80\x9d The driver, as a Lucknow man, was\r\npleased with the compliment, and told Kim many astounding things where\r\nan English guide would have talked of the Mutiny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we will go to the school,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim at last. The great old school\r\nof St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s in Partibus, block on block of low white buildings,\r\nstands in vast grounds over against the Gumti River, at some distance\r\nfrom the city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat like of folk are they within?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Sahibs\xe2\x80\x94all devils. But to speak truth, and I drive many of them\r\nto and fro from the railway station, I have never seen one that had in\r\nhim the making of a more perfect devil than thou\xe2\x80\x94this young Sahib whom\r\nI am now driving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNaturally, for he was never trained to consider them in any way\r\nimproper, Kim had passed the time of day with one or two frivolous\r\nladies at upper windows in a certain street, and naturally, in the\r\nexchange of compliments, had acquitted himself well. He was about to\r\nacknowledge the driver\xe2\x80\x99s last insolence, when his eye\xe2\x80\x94it was growing\r\ndusk\xe2\x80\x94caught a figure sitting by one of the white plaster gate-pillars\r\nin the long sweep of wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cStay here. I do not go to the school at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is to pay me for this coming and re-coming?\xe2\x80\x9d said the driver\r\npetulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the boy mad? Last time it was a dancing-girl. This time\r\nit is a priest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim was in the road headlong, patting the dusty feet beneath the dirty\r\nyellow robe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have waited here a day and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama\xe2\x80\x99s level voice began.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I had a disciple with me. He that was my friend at the Temple of\r\nthe Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey. I came from Benares\r\nin the _te-rain_, when thy letter was given me. Yes, I am well fed. I\r\nneed nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman, O Holy One? In what\r\nway didst thou get to Benares? My heart has been heavy since we\r\nparted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring charms for\r\nchildren. I separated myself from that company, permitting her to\r\nacquire merit by gifts. She is at least a woman of open hands, and I\r\nmade a promise to return to her house if need arose. Then, perceiving\r\nmyself alone in this great and terrible world, I bethought me of the\r\n_te-rain_ to Benares, where I knew one abode in the Tirthankars\xe2\x80\x99 Temple\r\nwho was a Seeker, even as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Thy River,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the River.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo soon, my _chela?_ I have never forgotten it. But when I had left\r\nthee it seemed better that I should go to the Temple and take counsel,\r\nfor, look you, India is very large, and it may be that wise men before\r\nus, some two or three, have left a record of the place of our River.\r\nThere is debate in the Temple of the Tirthankars on this matter; some\r\nsaying one thing, and some another. They are courteous folk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it; but what dost thou do now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI acquire merit in that I help thee, my _chela_, to wisdom. The priest\r\nof that body of men who serve the Red Bull wrote me that all should be\r\nas I desired for thee. I sent the money to suffice for one year, and\r\nthen I came, as thou seest me, to watch for thee going up into the\r\nGates of Learning. A day and a half have I waited, not because I was\r\nled by any affection towards thee\xe2\x80\x94that is no part of the Way\xe2\x80\x94but, as\r\nthey said at the Tirthankars\xe2\x80\x99 Temple, because, money having been paid\r\nfor learning, it was right that I should oversee the end of the matter.\r\nThey resolved my doubts most clearly. I had a fear that, perhaps, I\r\ncame because I wished to see thee\xe2\x80\x94misguided by the Red Mist of\r\naffection. It is not so ... Moreover, I am troubled by a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely, Holy One, thou hast not forgotten the Road and all that\r\nbefell on it. Surely it was a little to see me that thou didst come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe horses are cold, and it is past their feeding-time,\xe2\x80\x9d whined the\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\r\nsnarled over his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI am all alone in this land; I know not\r\nwhere I go nor what shall befall me. My heart was in that letter I sent\r\nthee. Except for Mahbub Ali, and he is a Pathan, I have no friend save\r\nthee, Holy One. Do not altogether go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have considered that also,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama replied, in a shaking voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire merit if before\r\nthat I have not found my River\xe2\x80\x94by assuring myself that thy feet are set\r\non wisdom. What they will teach thee I do not know, but the priest\r\nwrote me that no son of a Sahib in all India will be better taught than\r\nthou. So from time to time, therefore, I will come again. Maybe thou\r\nwilt be such a Sahib as he who gave me these spectacles\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the lama wiped\r\nthem elaborately\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin the Wonder House at Lahore. That is my hope, for\r\nhe was a Fountain of Wisdom\xe2\x80\x94wiser than many abbots .... Again, maybe\r\nthou wilt forget me and our meetings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I eat thy bread,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kim passionately, \xe2\x80\x9chow shall I ever forget\r\nthee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no.\xe2\x80\x9d He put the boy aside. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go back to Benares. From time to\r\ntime, now that I know the customs of letter-writers in this land, I\r\nwill send thee a letter, and from time to time I will come and see\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut whither shall I send my letters?\xe2\x80\x9d wailed Kim, clutching at the\r\nrobe, all forgetful that he was a Sahib.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares. That is the place I have\r\nchosen till I find my River. Do not weep; for, look you, all Desire is\r\nIllusion and a new binding upon the Wheel. Go up to the Gates of\r\nLearning. Let me see thee go ... Dost thou love me? Then go, or my\r\nheart cracks ... I will come again. Surely I will come again.\r\n\r\nThe lama watched the _ticca-gharri_ rumble into the compound, and\r\nstrode off, snuffing between each long stride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gates of Learning\xe2\x80\x9d shut with a clang.\r\n\r\nThe country born and bred boy has his own manners and customs, which do\r\nnot resemble those of any other land; and his teachers approach him by\r\nroads which an English master would not understand. Therefore, you\r\nwould scarcely be interested in Kim\xe2\x80\x99s experiences as a St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s boy\r\namong two or three hundred precocious youths, most of whom had never\r\nseen the sea. He suffered the usual penalties for breaking out of\r\nbounds when there was cholera in the city. This was before he had\r\nlearned to write fair English, and so was obliged to find a bazar\r\nletter-writer. He was, of course, indicted for smoking and for the use\r\nof abuse more full-flavoured than even St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s had ever heard. He\r\nlearned to wash himself with the Levitical scrupulosity of the\r\nnative-born, who in his heart considers the Englishman rather dirty. He\r\nplayed the usual tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs in\r\nthe sleeping-rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights\r\ntelling tales till the dawn; and quietly he measured himself against\r\nhis self-reliant mates.\r\n\r\nThey were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway, Telegraph, and\r\nCanal Services; of warrant-officers, sometimes retired and sometimes\r\nacting as commanders-in-chief to a feudatory Rajah\xe2\x80\x99s army; of captains\r\nof the Indian Marine Government pensioners, planters, Presidency\r\nshopkeepers, and missionaries. A few were cadets of the old Eurasian\r\nhouses that have taken strong root in Dhurrumtollah\xe2\x80\x94Pereiras, De\r\nSouzas, and D\xe2\x80\x99Silvas. Their parents could well have educated them in\r\nEngland, but they loved the school that had served their own youth, and\r\ngeneration followed sallow-hued generation at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s. Their homes\r\nranged from Howrah of the railway people to abandoned cantonments like\r\nMonghyr and Chunar; lost tea-gardens Shillong-way; villages where their\r\nfathers were large landholders in Oudh or the Deccan; Mission-stations\r\na week from the nearest railway line; seaports a thousand miles south,\r\nfacing the brazen Indian surf; and cinchona-plantations south of all.\r\nThe mere story of their adventures, which to them were no adventures,\r\non their road to and from school would have crisped a Western boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair. They were used to jogging off alone through a hundred miles of\r\njungle, where there was always the delightful chance of being delayed\r\nby tigers; but they would no more have bathed in the English Channel in\r\nan English August than their brothers across the world would have lain\r\nstill while a leopard snuffed at their palanquin. There were boys of\r\nfifteen who had spent a day and a half on an islet in the middle of a\r\nflooded river, taking charge, as by right, of a camp of frantic\r\npilgrims returning from a shrine. There were seniors who had\r\nrequisitioned a chance-met Rajah\xe2\x80\x99s elephant, in the name of St Francis\r\nXavier, when the Rains once blotted out the cart-track that led to\r\ntheir father\xe2\x80\x99s estate, and had all but lost the huge beast in a\r\nquicksand. There was a boy who, he said, and none doubted, had helped\r\nhis father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a rush of Akas in\r\nthe days when those head-hunters were bold against lonely plantations.\r\n\r\nAnd every tale was told in the even, passionless voice of the\r\nnative-born, mixed with quaint reflections, borrowed unconsciously from\r\nnative foster-mothers, and turns of speech that showed they had been\r\nthat instant translated from the vernacular. Kim watched, listened, and\r\napproved. This was not insipid, single-word talk of drummer-boys. It\r\ndealt with a life he knew and in part understood. The atmosphere suited\r\nhim, and he throve by inches. They gave him a white drill suit as the\r\nweather warmed, and he rejoiced in the new-found bodily comforts as he\r\nrejoiced to use his sharpened mind over the tasks they set him. His\r\nquickness would have delighted an English master; but at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthey know the first rush of minds developed by sun and surroundings, as\r\nthey know the half-collapse that sets in at twenty-two or twenty-three.\r\n\r\nNone the less he remembered to hold himself lowly. When tales were told\r\nof hot nights, Kim did not sweep the board with his reminiscences; for\r\nSt Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s looks down on boys who \xe2\x80\x9cgo native all-together.\xe2\x80\x9d One must\r\nnever forget that one is a Sahib, and that some day, when examinations\r\nare passed, one will command natives. Kim made a note of this, for he\r\nbegan to understand where examinations led.\r\n\r\nThen came the holidays from August to October\xe2\x80\x94the long holidays imposed\r\nby the heat and the Rains. Kim was informed that he would go north to\r\nsome station in the hills behind Umballa, where Father Victor would\r\narrange for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA barrack-school?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, who had asked many questions and thought\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will not do you any harm to\r\nkeep you out of mischief. You can go up with young De Castro as far as\r\nDelhi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim considered it in every possible light. He had been diligent, even\r\nas the Colonel advised. A boy\xe2\x80\x99s holiday was his own property\xe2\x80\x94of so much\r\nthe talk of his companions had advised him,\xe2\x80\x94and a barrack-school would\r\nbe torment after St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s. Moreover\xe2\x80\x94this was magic worth anything\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x94he could write. In three months he had discovered how men can\r\nspeak to each other without a third party, at the cost of half an anna\r\nand a little knowledge. No word had come from the lama, but there\r\nremained the Road. Kim yearned for the caress of soft mud squishing up\r\nbetween the toes, as his mouth watered for mutton stewed with butter\r\nand cabbages, for rice speckled with strong scented cardamoms, for the\r\nsaffron-tinted rice, garlic and onions, and the forbidden greasy\r\nsweetmeats of the bazars. They would feed him raw beef on a platter at\r\nthe barrack-school, and he must smoke by stealth. But again, he was a\r\nSahib and was at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s, and that pig Mahbub Ali ... No, he would\r\nnot test Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality\xe2\x80\x94and yet ... He thought it out alone in\r\nthe dormitory, and came to the conclusion he had been unjust to Mahbub.\r\n\r\nThe school was empty; nearly all the masters had gone away; Colonel\r\nCreighton\xe2\x80\x99s railway pass lay in his hand, and Kim puffed himself that\r\nhe had not spent Colonel Creighton\xe2\x80\x99s or Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s money in riotous\r\nliving. He was still lord of two rupees seven annas. His new\r\nbullock-trunk, marked \xe2\x80\x9cK. O\xe2\x80\x99H.\xe2\x80\x9d, and bedding-roll lay in the empty\r\nsleeping-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSahibs are always tied to their baggage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, nodding at them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will stay here\xe2\x80\x9d He went out into the warm rain, smiling sinfully,\r\nand sought a certain house whose outside he had noted down some time\r\nbefore...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArre\xe2\x80\x9d! Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this quarter? Oh,\r\nshame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas I born yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim squatted native-fashion on the cushions of\r\nthat upper room. \xe2\x80\x9cA little dyestuff and three yards of cloth to help\r\nout a jest. Is it much to ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is _she?_ Thou art full young, as Sahibs go, for this devilry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she? She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of a regiment\r\nin the cantonments. He has beaten me twice because I went over their\r\nwall in these clothes. Now I would go as a gardener\xe2\x80\x99s boy. Old men are\r\nvery jealous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true. Hold thy face still while I dab on the juice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot too black, _Naikan_. I would not appear to her as a _hubshi_\r\n(nigger).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, love makes nought of these things. And how old is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve years, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shameless Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cSpread it also on the\r\nbreast. It may be her father will tear my clothes off me, and if I am\r\npiebald\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\nThe girl worked busily, dabbing a twist of cloth into a little saucer\r\nof brown dye that holds longer than any walnut-juice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow send out and get me a cloth for the turban. Woe is me, my head is\r\nall unshaved! And he will surely knock off my turban.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a barber, but I will make shift. Thou wast born to be a\r\nbreaker of hearts! All this disguise for one evening? Remember, the\r\nstuff does not wash away.\xe2\x80\x9d She shook with laughter till her bracelets\r\nand anklets jingled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut who is to pay me for this? Huneefa herself\r\ncould not have given thee better stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust in the Gods, my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim gravely, screwing his face\r\nround as the stain dried. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, hast thou ever helped to paint a\r\nSahib thus before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever indeed. But a jest is not money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is worth much more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChild, thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son of Shaitan\r\nthat I have ever known to take up a poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s time with this play,\r\nand then to say: \xe2\x80\x98Is not the jest enough?\xe2\x80\x99 Thou wilt go very far in\r\nthis world.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave the dancing-girls\xe2\x80\x99 salutation in mockery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll one. Make haste and rough-cut my head.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim shifted from foot to\r\nfoot, his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat days before\r\nhim. He gave the girl four annas, and ran down the stairs in the\r\nlikeness of a low-caste Hindu boy\xe2\x80\x94perfect in every detail. A cookshop\r\nwas his next point of call, where he feasted in extravagance and greasy\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\nOn Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro, all covered\r\nwith prickly-heat, get into a second-class compartment. Kim patronized\r\na third, and was the life and soul of it. He explained to the company\r\nthat he was assistant to a juggler who had left him behind sick with\r\nfever, and that he would pick up his master at Umballa. As the\r\noccupants of the carriage changed, he varied this tale, or adorned it\r\nwith all the shoots of a budding fancy, the more rampant for being held\r\noff native speech so long. In all India that night was no human being\r\nso joyful as Kim. At Umballa he got out and headed eastward, plashing\r\nover the sodden fields to the village where the old soldier lived.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from Lucknow by\r\nwire that young O\xe2\x80\x99Hara had disappeared. Mahbub Ali was in town selling\r\nhorses, and to him the Colonel confided the affair one morning\r\ncantering round Annandale racecourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the horse-dealer. \xe2\x80\x9cMen are like horses. At\r\ncertain times they need salt, and if that salt is not in the mangers\r\nthey will lick it up from the earth. He has gone back to the Road again\r\nfor a while. The _madrissah_ wearied him. I knew it would. Another\r\ntime, I will take him upon the Road myself. Do not be troubled,\r\nCreighton Sahib. It is as though a polo-pony, breaking loose, ran out\r\nto learn the game alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is not dead, think you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFever might kill him. I do not fear for the boy otherwise. A monkey\r\ndoes not fall among trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext morning, on the same course, Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s stallion ranged alongside\r\nthe Colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as I had thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said the horse-dealer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has come through\r\nUmballa at least, and there he has written a letter to me, having\r\nlearned in the bazar that I was here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, with a sigh of relief. It was absurd that a\r\nman of his position should take an interest in a little country-bred\r\nvagabond; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in the train, and\r\noften in the past few months had caught himself thinking of the queer,\r\nsilent, self-possessed boy. His evasion, of course, was the height of\r\ninsolence, but it argued some resource and nerve.\r\n\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of the cramped\r\nlittle plain, where none could come near unseen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_The Friend of the Stars, who is the Friend of all the World_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA name we give him in Lahore city. \xe2\x80\x98_The Friend of all the World takes\r\nleave to go to his own places. He will come back upon the appointed\r\nday. Let the box and the bedding-roll be sent for; and if there has\r\nbeen a fault, let the Hand of Friendship turn aside the Whip of\r\nCalamity._\xe2\x80\x99 There is yet a little more, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Certain things are not known to those who eat with forks. It is\r\nbetter to eat with both hands for a while. Speak soft words to those\r\nwho do not understand this that the return may be propitious._\xe2\x80\x99 Now the\r\nmanner in which that was cast is, of course, the work of the\r\nletter-writer, but see how wisely the boy has devised the matter of it\r\nso that no hint is given except to those who know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the Hand of Friendship to avert the Whip of Calamity?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed\r\nthe Colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how wise is the boy. He would go back to the Road again, as I\r\nsaid. Not knowing yet thy trade\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d the Colonel muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe turns to me to make a peace between you. Is he not wise? He says he\r\nwill return. He is but perfecting his knowledge. Think, Sahib! He has\r\nbeen three months at the school. And he is not mouthed to that bit. For\r\nmy part, I rejoice. The pony learns the game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but another time he must not go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? He went alone before he came under the Colonel Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotection. When he comes to the Great Game he must go alone\xe2\x80\x94alone, and\r\nat peril of his head. _Then_, if he spits, or sneezes, or sits down\r\nother than as the people do whom he watches, he may be slain. Why\r\nhinder him now? Remember how the Persians say: The jackal that lives in\r\nthe wilds of Mazanderan can only be caught by the hounds of\r\nMazanderan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. It is true, Mahbub Ali. And if he comes to no harm, I do not\r\ndesire anything better. But it is great insolence on his part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not tell me, even, whither he goes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is no\r\nfool. When his time is accomplished he will come to me. It is time the\r\nhealer of pearls took him in hand. He ripens too quickly\xe2\x80\x94as Sahibs\r\nreckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later. Mahbub had\r\ngone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses, and Kim\r\nmet him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone, begged an alms of him,\r\nwas sworn at, and replied in English. There was nobody within earshot\r\nto hear Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s gasp of amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! And where hast thou been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp and down\xe2\x80\x94down and up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome under a tree, out of the wet, and tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stayed for a while with an old man near Umballa; anon with a\r\nhousehold of my acquaintance in Umballa. With one of these I went as\r\nfar as Delhi to the southward. That is a wondrous city. Then I drove a\r\nbullock for a _teli_ (an oilman) coming north; but I heard of a great\r\nfeast forward in Patiala, and thither went I in the company of a\r\nfirework-maker. It was a great feast\xe2\x80\x9d (Kim rubbed his stomach). \xe2\x80\x9cI saw\r\nRajahs, and elephants with gold and silver trappings; and they lit all\r\nthe fireworks at once, whereby eleven men were killed, my\r\nfire-work-maker among them, and I was blown across a tent but took no\r\nharm. Then I came back to the _r\xc3\xaal_ with a Sikh horseman, to whom I was\r\ngroom for my bread; and so here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Shabash!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub Ali.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what does the Colonel Sahib say? I do not wish to be beaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hand of Friendship has averted the Whip of Calamity; but another\r\ntime, when thou takest the Road it will be with me. This is too early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLate enough for me. I have learned to read and to write English a\r\nlittle at the _madrissah_. I shall soon be altogether a Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Mahbub, looking at the little drenched figure\r\ndancing in the wet. \xe2\x80\x9cSalaam\xe2\x80\x94Sahib,\xe2\x80\x9d and he saluted ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, art tired of the Road, or wilt thou come on to Umballa with me\r\nand work back with the horses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come with thee, Mahbub Ali.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething I owe to the soil that grew\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    More to the life that fed\xe2\x80\x94\r\nBut most to Allah Who gave me two\r\n    Separate sides to my head.\r\n\r\nI would go without shirts or shoes,\r\n    Friends, tobacco or bread\r\nSooner than for an instant lose\r\n    Either side of my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen in God\xe2\x80\x99s name take blue for red,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub, alluding to the\r\nHindu colour of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s disreputable turban.\r\n\r\nKim countered with the old proverb, \xe2\x80\x9cI will change my faith and my\r\nbedding, but _thou_ must pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse. At a shop on the\r\noutskirts of the city the change was made, and Kim stood up, externally\r\nat least, a Mohammedan.\r\n\r\nMahbub hired a room over against the railway station, sent for a cooked\r\nmeal of the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats (_balushai_ we call\r\nit) and fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is better than some other meat that I ate with the Sikh,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nKim, grinning as he squatted, \xe2\x80\x9cand assuredly they give no such victuals\r\nat my _madrissah_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a desire to hear of that same _madrissah_.\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub stuffed\r\nhimself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat with cabbage\r\nand golden-brown onions. \xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me first, altogether and truthfully,\r\nthe manner of thy escape. For, O Friend of all the World,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he loosed\r\nhis cracking belt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think it is often that a Sahib and the son\r\nof a Sahib runs away from there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should they? They do not know the land. It was nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim,\r\nand began his tale. When he came to the disguisement and the interview\r\nwith the girl in the bazar, Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s gravity went from him. He\r\nlaughed aloud and beat his hand on his thigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Shabash! Shabash!_ Oh, well done, little one! What will the healer of\r\nturquoises say to this? Now, slowly, let us hear what befell\r\nafterwards\xe2\x80\x94step by step, omitting nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStep by step then, Kim told his adventures between coughs as the\r\nfull-flavoured tobacco caught his lungs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mahbub Ali to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI _said_ it was the pony\r\nbreaking out to play polo. The fruit is ripe already\xe2\x80\x94except that he\r\nmust learn his distances and his pacings, and his rods and his\r\ncompasses. Listen now. I have turned aside the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s whip from thy\r\nskin, and that is no small service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim pulled serenely. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not to be thought that this running out and in is any way\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my holiday, Hajji. I was a slave for many weeks. Why should I\r\nnot run away when the school was shut? Look, too, how I, living upon my\r\nfriends or working for my bread, as I did with the Sikh, have saved the\r\nColonel Sahib a great expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are a few rupees\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Pathan threw out his open hand\r\ncarelessly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto the Colonel Sahib? He spends them for a purpose, not in\r\nany way for love of thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew a very long time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Colonel Sahib himself. Not in those many words, but plainly enough\r\nfor one who is not altogether a mud-head. Yea, he told me in the\r\n_te-rain_ when we went down to Lucknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so. Then I will tell thee more, Friend of all the World, though\r\nin the telling I lend thee my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was forfeit to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, with deep relish, \xe2\x80\x9cin Umballa, when\r\nthou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy beat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak a little plainer. All the world may tell lies save thou and I.\r\nFor equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is known to me also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, readjusting the live\r\ncharcoal-ball on the weed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very sure tie between us. Indeed,\r\nthy hold is surer even than mine; for who would miss a boy beaten to\r\ndeath, or, it may be, thrown into a well by the roadside? Most people\r\nhere and in Simla and across the passes behind the Hills would, on the\r\nother hand, say: \xe2\x80\x98What has come to Mahbub Ali?\xe2\x80\x99 if he were found dead\r\namong his horses. Surely, too, the Colonel Sahib would make inquiries.\r\nBut again,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim\xe2\x80\x99s face puckered with cunning,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che would not make\r\noverlong inquiry, lest people should ask: \xe2\x80\x98What has this Colonel Sahib\r\nto do with that horse-dealer?\xe2\x80\x99 But I\xe2\x80\x94if I lived\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs thou wouldst surely die\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be; but I say, _if_ I lived, I, and I alone, would know that\r\none had come by night, as a common thief perhaps, to Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbulkhead in the serai, and there had slain him, either before or after\r\nthat thief had made a full search into his saddlebags and between the\r\nsoles of his slippers. Is that news to tell to the Colonel, or would he\r\nsay to me\xe2\x80\x94(I have not forgotten when he sent me back for a cigar-case\r\nthat he had _not_ left behind him)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98What is Mahbub Ali to me?\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp went a gout of heavy smoke. There was a long pause: then Mahbub Ali\r\nspoke in admiration: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd with these things on thy mind, dost thou lie\r\ndown and rise again among all the Sahibs\xe2\x80\x99 little sons at the\r\n_madrissah_ and meekly take instruction from thy teachers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an order,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cWho am I to dispute an order?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most finished Son of Eblis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub Ali. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is this tale\r\nof the thief and the search?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat which I saw,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, \xe2\x80\x9cthe night that my lama and I lay next\r\nthy place in the Kashmir Seral. The door was left unlocked, which I\r\nthink is not thy custom, Mahbub. He came in as one assured that thou\r\nwouldst not soon return. My eye was against a knot-hole in the plank.\r\nHe searched as it were for something\xe2\x80\x94not a rug, not stirrups, nor a\r\nbridle, nor brass pots\xe2\x80\x94something little and most carefully hid. Else\r\nwhy did he prick with an iron between the soles of thy slippers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub Ali smiled gently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd seeing these things, what tale\r\ndidst thou fashion to thyself, Well of the Truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone. I put my hand upon my amulet, which lies always next to my skin,\r\nand, remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had bitten out\r\nof a piece of Mussalmani bread, I went away to Umballa perceiving that\r\na heavy trust was laid upon me. At that hour, had I chosen, thy head\r\nwas forfeit. It needed only to say to that man, \xe2\x80\x98I have here a paper\r\nconcerning a horse which I cannot read.\xe2\x80\x99 And then?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim peered at\r\nMahbub under his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thou wouldst have drunk water twice\xe2\x80\x94perhaps thrice, afterwards. I\r\ndo not think more than thrice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. I thought of that a little, but most I thought that I\r\nloved thee, Mahbub. Therefore I went to Umballa, as thou knowest, but\r\n(and this thou dost not know) I lay hid in the garden-grass to see what\r\nColonel Creighton Sahib might do upon reading the white stallion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npedigree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did he?\xe2\x80\x9d for Kim had bitten off the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost _thou_ give news for love, or dost thou sell it?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sell and\xe2\x80\x94I buy.\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his belt and\r\nheld it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, mechanically following the huckster instinct of the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nMahbub laughed, and put away the coin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too easy to deal in that\r\nmarket, Friend of all the World. Tell me for love. Our lives lie in\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I saw the Jang-i-Lat Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief] come to\r\na big dinner. I saw him in Creighton Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s office. I saw the two read\r\nthe white stallion\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree. I heard the very orders given for the\r\nopening of a great war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire. \xe2\x80\x9cThe game is well played.\r\nThat war is done now, and the evil, we hope, nipped before the\r\nflower\xe2\x80\x94thanks to me\xe2\x80\x94and thee. What didst thou later?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among\r\nthe villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama. But I bore\r\naway the old man\xe2\x80\x99s purse, and the Brahmin found nothing. So next\r\nmorning he was angry. Ho! Ho! And I also used the news when I fell into\r\nthe hands of that white Regiment with their Bull!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was foolishness.\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub scowled. \xe2\x80\x9cNews is not meant to be thrown\r\nabout like dung-cakes, but used sparingly\xe2\x80\x94like _bhang_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I think now, and moreover, it did me no sort of good. But that was\r\nvery long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he made as to brush it all away with a thin brown\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand since then, and especially in the nights under the punkah at\r\nthe _madrissah_, I have thought very greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-born\xe2\x80\x99s thought might have\r\nled?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub, with an elaborate sarcasm, smoothing his scarlet\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, and threw back the very tone. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say at\r\nNucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made a fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s hand shot into his bosom, for to call a Pathan a \xe2\x80\x9cblack man\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(_kala admi_) is a blood-insult. Then he remembered and laughed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, Sahib. Thy black man hears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, \xe2\x80\x9cI am _not_ a Sahib, and I say I made a fault to curse\r\nthee, Mahbub Ali, on that day at Umballa when I thought I was betrayed\r\nby a Pathan. I was senseless; for I was but newly caught, and I wished\r\nto kill that low-caste drummer-boy. I say now, Hajji, that it was well\r\ndone; and I see my road all clear before me to a good service. I will\r\nstay in the _madrissah_ till I am ripe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said. Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of\r\nusing compasses to be learned in that game. One waits in the Hills\r\nabove to show thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will learn their teaching upon a condition\xe2\x80\x94that my time is given to\r\nme without question when the _madrissah_ is shut. Ask that for me of\r\nthe Colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs\xe2\x80\x99 tongue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Colonel is the servant of the Government. He is sent hither and\r\nyon at a word, and must consider his own advancement. (See how much I\r\nhave already learned at Nucklao!) Moreover, the Colonel I know since\r\nthree months only. I have known one Mahbub Ali for six years. So! To\r\nthe _madrissah_ I will go. At the _madrissah_ I will learn. In the\r\n_madrissah_ I will be a Sahib. But when the _madrissah_ is shut, then\r\nmust I be free and go among my people. Otherwise I die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who are thy people, Friend of all the World?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis great and beautiful land,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, waving his paw round the\r\nlittle clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche burned heavily\r\nthrough the tobacco-smoke. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, further, I would see my lama again.\r\nAnd, further, I need money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the need of everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI will give thee\r\neight annas, for much money is not picked out of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hooves, and it\r\nmust suffice for many days. As to all the rest, I am well pleased, and\r\nno further talk is needed. Make haste to learn, and in three years, or\r\nit may be less, thou wilt be an aid\xe2\x80\x94even to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I been such a hindrance till now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, with a boy\xe2\x80\x99s giggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not give answers,\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub grunted. \xe2\x80\x9cThou art my new horse-boy. Go\r\nand bed among my men. They are near the north end of the station, with\r\nthe horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without\r\nauthority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahbub felt in his belt, wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese ink, and\r\ndabbed the impression on a piece of soft native paper. From Balkh to\r\nBombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old scar running\r\ndiagonally across it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough to show my headman. I come in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy which road?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the road from the city. There is but one, and then we return to\r\nCreighton Sahib. I have saved thee a beating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah! What is a beating when the very head is loose on the\r\nshoulders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim slid out quietly into the night, walked half round the house,\r\nkeeping close to the walls, and headed away from the station for a mile\r\nor so. Then, fetching a wide compass, he worked back at leisure, for he\r\nneeded time to invent a story if any of Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s retainers asked\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThey were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway, and,\r\nbeing natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks in which\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by\r\nthe Bombay tram-company. The headman, a broken-down,\r\nconsumptive-looking Mohammedan, promptly challenged Kim, but was\r\npacified at sight of Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s sign-manual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hajji has of his favour given me service,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim testily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthis be doubted, wait till he comes in the morning. Meantime, a place\r\nby the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFollowed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native must\r\nraise on every occasion. It died down, and Kim lay out behind the\r\nlittle knot of Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s followers, almost under the wheels of a\r\nhorse-truck, a borrowed blanket for covering. Now a bed among brickbats\r\nand ballast-refuse on a damp night, between overcrowded horses and\r\nunwashed Baltis, would not appeal to many white boys; but Kim was\r\nutterly happy. Change of scene, service, and surroundings were the\r\nbreath of his little nostrils, and thinking of the neat white cots of\r\nSt Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s all arow under the punkah gave him joy as keen as the\r\nrepetition of the multiplication-table in English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very old,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought sleepily. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery month I become a year more\r\nold. I was very young, and a fool to boot, when I took Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s message\r\nto Umballa. Even when I was with that white Regiment I was very young\r\nand small and had no wisdom. But now I learn every day, and in three\r\nyears the Colonel will take me out of the _madrissah_ and let me go\r\nupon the Road with Mahbub hunting for horses\xe2\x80\x99 pedigrees, or maybe I\r\nshall go by myself; or maybe I shall find the lama and go with him.\r\nYes; that is best. To walk again as a _chela_ with my lama when he\r\ncomes back to Benares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly. He was plunging into\r\na beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper, thin and sharp,\r\nabove the monotonous babble round the fire. It came from behind the\r\niron-skinned horse-truck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not here, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere should he be but roystering in the city. Who looks for a rat in\r\na frog-pond? Come away. He is not our man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must not go back beyond the Passes a second time. It is the order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHire some woman to drug him. It is a few rupees only, and there is no\r\nevidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept the woman. It must be more certain; and remember the price upon\r\nhis head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but the police have a long arm, and we are far from the Border. If\r\nit were in Peshawur, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94in Peshawur,\xe2\x80\x9d the second voice sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cPeshawur, full of his\r\nblood-kin\xe2\x80\x94full of bolt-holes and women behind whose clothes he will\r\nhide. Yes, Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us equally well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is the plan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO fool, have I not told it a hundred times? Wait till he comes to lie\r\ndown, and then one sure shot. The trucks are between us and pursuit. We\r\nhave but to run back over the lines and go our way. They will not see\r\nwhence the shot came. Wait here at least till the dawn. What manner of\r\n_faquir_ art thou, to shiver at a little watching?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kim, behind close-shut eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce again it is Mahbub.\r\nIndeed a white stallion\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree is not a good thing to peddle to\r\nSahibs! Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news. Now what is to do,\r\nKim? I know not where Mahbub houses, and if he comes here before the\r\ndawn they will shoot him. That would be no profit for thee, Kim. And\r\nthis is not a matter for the police. That would be no profit for\r\nMahbub; and\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he giggled almost aloud\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI do not remember any lesson at\r\nNucklao which will help me. Allah! Here is Kim and yonder are they.\r\nFirst, then, Kim must wake and go away, so that they shall not suspect.\r\nA bad dream wakes a man\xe2\x80\x94thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw the blanket off his face, and raised himself suddenly with the\r\nterrible, bubbling, meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by\r\nnightmare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUrr-urr-urr-urr! Ya-la-la-la-la! _Narain!_ The _churel!_ The\r\n_churel!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA _churel_ is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has died in\r\nchild-bed. She haunts lonely roads, her feet are turned backwards on\r\nthe ankles, and she leads men to torment.\r\n\r\nLouder rose Kim\xe2\x80\x99s quavering howl, till at last he leaped to his feet\r\nand staggered off sleepily, while the camp cursed him for waking them.\r\nSome twenty yards farther up the line he lay down again, taking care\r\nthat the whisperers should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed\r\nhimself. After a few minutes he rolled towards the road and stole away\r\ninto the thick darkness.\r\n\r\nHe paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert, and dropped behind\r\nit, his chin on a level with the coping-stone. Here he could command\r\nall the night-traffic, himself unseen.\r\n\r\nTwo or three carts passed, jingling out to the suburbs; a coughing\r\npoliceman and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep off\r\nevil spirits. Then rapped the shod feet of a horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! This is more like Mahbub,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kim, as the beast shied at the\r\nlittle head above the culvert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d, Mahbub Ali,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9chave a care!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horse was reined back almost on its haunches, and forced towards\r\nthe culvert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub, \xe2\x80\x9cwill I take a shod horse for night-work.\r\nThey pick up all the bones and nails in the city.\xe2\x80\x9d He stooped to lift\r\nits forefoot, and that brought his head within a foot of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown\xe2\x80\x94keep down,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night is full of eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks. They will shoot thee\r\nat thy lying down, because there is a price on thy head. I heard,\r\nsleeping near the horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst thou see them? ... Hold still, Sire of Devils!\xe2\x80\x9d This furiously\r\nto the horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas one dressed belike as a _faquir?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne said to the other, \xe2\x80\x98What manner of _faquir_ art thou, to shiver at\r\na little watching?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Go back to the camp and lie down. I do not die tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahbub wheeled his horse and vanished. Kim tore back down the ditch\r\ntill he reached a point opposite his second resting-place, slipped\r\nacross the road like a weasel, and re-coiled himself in the blanket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least Mahbub knows,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought contentedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd certainly he\r\nspoke as one expecting it. I do not think those two men will profit by\r\ntonight\xe2\x80\x99s watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, and, with the best will in the world to keep awake all\r\nnight, he slept deeply. Now and again a night train roared along the\r\nmetals within twenty feet of him; but he had all the Oriental\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindifference to mere noise, and it did not even weave a dream through\r\nhis slumber.\r\n\r\nMahbub was anything but asleep. It annoyed him vehemently that people\r\noutside his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours should pursue him\r\nfor the life. His first and natural impulse was to cross the line lower\r\ndown, work up again, and, catching his well-wishers from behind,\r\nsummarily slay them. Here, he reflected with sorrow, another branch of\r\nthe Government, totally unconnected with Colonel Creighton, might\r\ndemand explanations which would be hard to supply; and he knew that\r\nsouth of the Border a perfectly ridiculous fuss is made about a corpse\r\nor so. He had not been troubled in this way since he sent Kim to\r\nUmballa with the message, and hoped that suspicion had been finally\r\ndiverted.\r\n\r\nThen a most brilliant notion struck him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe English do eternally tell the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctherefore we of\r\nthis country are eternally made foolish. By Allah, I will tell the\r\ntruth to an Englishman! Of what use is the Government police if a poor\r\nKabuli be robbed of his horses in their very trucks. This is as bad as\r\nPeshawur! I should lay a complaint at the station. Better still, some\r\nyoung Sahib on the Railway! They are zealous, and if they catch thieves\r\nit is remembered to their honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tied up his horse outside the station, and strode on to the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x9d said a young Assistant District Traffic\r\nSuperintendent who was waiting to go down the line\xe2\x80\x94a tall, tow-haired,\r\nhorsey youth in dingy white linen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here? Selling\r\nweeds\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I am not troubled for my horses. I come to look for Lutuf Ullah. I\r\nhave a truck-load up the line. Could anyone take them out without the\r\nRailway\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Mahbub. You can claim against us if they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks\r\nnearly all night. _Faquirs_ do not steal horses, so I gave them no more\r\nthought. I would find Lutuf Ullah, my partner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce you did? And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother your head about it? \xe2\x80\x99Pon my\r\nword, it\xe2\x80\x99s just almost as well that I met you. What were they like,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were only _faquirs_. They will no more than take a little grain,\r\nperhaps, from one of the trucks. There are many up the line. The State\r\nwill never miss the dole. I came here seeking for my partner, Lutuf\r\nUllah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind your partner. Where are your horse-trucks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little to this side of the farthest place where they make lamps for\r\nthe trains.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe signal-box! Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand side\xe2\x80\x94looking\r\nup the line thus. But as regards Lutuf Ullah\xe2\x80\x94a tall man with a broken\r\nnose, and a Persian greyhound Aie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman;\r\nfor, as he said, the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the\r\ngoods-yard. Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will walk in their boots, making a noise, and then they will\r\nwonder why there are no _faquirs_. They are very clever boys\xe2\x80\x94Barton\r\nSahib and Young Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited idly for a few minutes, expecting to see them hurry up the\r\nline girt for action. A light engine slid through the station, and he\r\ncaught a glimpse of young Barton in the cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did that child an injustice. He is not altogether a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMahbub Ali. \xe2\x80\x9cTo take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new game!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn, no one thought it worth\r\nwhile to tell him any news of the night. No one, at least, but one\r\nsmall horseboy, newly advanced to the great man\xe2\x80\x99s service, whom Mahbub\r\ncalled to his tiny tent to assist in some packing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all known to me,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Kim, bending above saddlebags. \xe2\x80\x99Two\r\nSahibs came up on a _te-train_. I was running to and fro in the dark on\r\nthis side of the trucks as the _te-train_ moved up and down slowly.\r\nThey fell upon two men sitting under this truck\xe2\x80\x94Hajji, what shall I do\r\nwith this lump of tobacco? Wrap it in paper and put it under the\r\nsalt-bag? Yes\xe2\x80\x94and struck them down. But one man struck at a Sahib with\r\na _faquir\xe2\x80\x99s_ buck\xe2\x80\x99s horn\xe2\x80\x9d (Kim meant the conjoined black-buck horns,\r\nwhich are a _faquir\xe2\x80\x99s_ sole temporal weapon)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe blood came. So the\r\nother Sahib, first smiting his own man senseless, smote the stabber\r\nwith a short gun which had rolled from the first man\xe2\x80\x99s hand. They all\r\nraged as though mad together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahbub smiled with heavenly resignation. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! That is not so much\r\n_dewanee_ (madness, or a case for the civil court\xe2\x80\x94the word can be\r\npunned upon both ways) as _nizamut_ (a criminal case). A gun, sayest\r\nthou? Ten good years in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they both lay still, but I think they were nearly dead when they\r\nwere put on the _te-train_. Their heads moved thus. And there is much\r\nblood on the line. Come and see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen blood before. Jail is the sure place\xe2\x80\x94and assuredly they\r\nwill give false names, and assuredly no man will find them for a long\r\ntime. They were unfriends of mine. Thy fate and mine seem on one\r\nstring. What a tale for the healer of pearls! Now swiftly with the\r\nsaddle-bags and the cooking-platter. We will take out the horses and\r\naway to Simla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSwiftly\xe2\x80\x94as Orientals understand speed\xe2\x80\x94with long explanations, with\r\nabuse and windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks for little\r\nthings forgotten, the untidy camp broke up and led the half-dozen stiff\r\nand fretful horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept\r\ndawn. Kim, regarded as Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s favourite by all who wished to\r\nstand well with the Pathan, was not called upon to work. They strolled\r\non by the easiest of stages, halting every few hours at a wayside\r\nshelter. Very many Sahibs travel along the Kalka road; and, as Mahbub\r\nAli says, every young Sahib must needs esteem himself a judge of a\r\nhorse, and, though he be over head in debt to the money-lender, must\r\nmake as if to buy. That was the reason that Sahib after Sahib, rolling\r\nalong in a stage-carriage, would stop and open talk. Some would even\r\ndescend from their vehicles and feel the horses\xe2\x80\x99 legs; asking inane\r\nquestions, or, through sheer ignorance of the vernacular, grossly\r\ninsulting the imperturbable trader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen first I dealt with Sahibs, and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib\r\nwas Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncamping-ground for spite,\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his\r\npipe under a tree, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not know how greatly they were fools, and\r\nthis made me wroth. As thus\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d and he told Kim a tale of an expression,\r\nmisused in all innocence, that doubled Kim up with mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I see,\r\nhowever,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he exhaled smoke slowly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat it is with them as with all\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94in certain matters they are wise, and in others most foolish. Very\r\nfoolish it is to use the wrong word to a stranger; for though the heart\r\nmay be clean of offence, how is the stranger to know that? He is more\r\nlike to search truth with a dagger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. True talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cFools speak of a cat when a\r\nwoman is brought to bed, for instance. I have heard them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly behoves thee to\r\nremember this with both kinds of faces. Among Sahibs, never forgetting\r\nthou art a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always remembering thou art\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe paused, with a puzzled smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist? That is a hard knot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou wilt be\r\ndamned. So says my Law\xe2\x80\x94or I think it does. But thou art also my Little\r\nFriend of all the World, and I love thee. So says my heart. This matter\r\nof creeds is like horseflesh. The wise man knows horses are good\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthere is a profit to be made from all; and for myself\xe2\x80\x94but that I am a\r\ngood Sunni and hate the men of Tirah\xe2\x80\x94I could believe the same of all\r\nthe Faiths. Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare taken from the sands of her\r\nbirthplace and removed to the west of Bengal founders\xe2\x80\x94nor is even a\r\nBalkh stallion (and there are no better horses than those of Balkh,\r\nwere they not so heavy in the shoulder) of any account in the great\r\nNorthern deserts beside the snow-camels I have seen. Therefore I say in\r\nmy heart the Faiths are like the horses. Each has merit in its own\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my lama said altogether a different thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal. My heart is a little\r\nangry, Friend of all the World, that thou shouldst see such worth in a\r\nman so little known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, Hajji; but that worth do I see, and to him my heart is\r\ndrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his to thine, I hear. Hearts are like horses. They come and they\r\ngo against bit or spur. Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that bay\r\nstallion\xe2\x80\x99s pickets more firmly. We do not want a horse-fight at every\r\nresting-stage, and the dun and the black will be locked in a little ...\r\nNow hear me. Is it necessary to the comfort of thy heart to see that\r\nlama?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is one part of my bond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I do not see him, and if he\r\nis taken from me, I will go out of that _madrissah_ in Nucklao and,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94once gone, who is to find me again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than thou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMahbub nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim spoke as though he could have vanished on the\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lama has said that he will come to see me at the\r\n_madrissah_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Sa\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot all!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim cut in with a snort. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir eyes are blued and their\r\nnails are blackened with low-caste blood, many of them. Sons of\r\n_mehteeranees_\xe2\x80\x94brothers-in-law to the _bhungi_ (sweeper).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe need not follow the rest of the pedigree; but Kim made his little\r\npoint clearly and without heat, chewing a piece of sugar-cane the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend of all the World,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub, pushing over the pipe for the\r\nboy to clean, \xe2\x80\x9cI have met many men, women, and boys, and not a few\r\nSahibs. I have never in all my days met such an imp as thou art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why? When I always tell thee the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the very reason, for this is a world of danger to honest men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground, girt in his belt, and went\r\nover to the horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr sell it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat new\r\ndevilry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight annas, and I will tell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cIt touches thy\r\npeace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Shaitan!\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub gave the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the dark, down\r\nyonder at Umballa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing they sought my life, I have not altogether forgotten. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRememberest thou the Kashmir Serai?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will twist thy ears in a moment\xe2\x80\x94Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need\xe2\x80\x94Pathan. Only, the second _faquir_, whom the Sahibs beat\r\nsenseless, was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at Lahore. I saw\r\nhis face as they helped him on the engine. The very same man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didst thou not tell before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he will go to jail, and be safe for some years. There is no need\r\nto tell more than is necessary at any one time. Besides, I did not then\r\nneed money for sweetmeats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah kerim!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub Ah. \xe2\x80\x9cWilt thou some day sell my head for a\r\nfew sweetmeats if the fit takes thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim will remember till he dies that long, lazy journey from Umballa,\r\nthrough Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by, up to Simla. A sudden\r\nspate in the Gugger River swept down one horse (the most valuable, be\r\nsure), and nearly drowned Kim among the dancing boulders. Farther up\r\nthe road the horses were stampeded by a Government elephant, and being\r\nin high condition of grass food, it cost a day and a half to get them\r\ntogether again. Then they met Sikandar Khan coming down with a few\r\nunsaleable screws\xe2\x80\x94remnants of his string\xe2\x80\x94and Mahbub, who has more of\r\nhorse-coping in his little fingernail than Sikandar Khan in all his\r\ntents, must needs buy two of the worst, and that meant eight hours\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlaborious diplomacy and untold tobacco. But it was all pure delight\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nwandering road, climbing, dipping, and sweeping about the growing\r\nspurs; the flush of the morning laid along the distant snows; the\r\nbranched cacti, tier upon tier on the stony hillsides; the voices of a\r\nthousand water-channels; the chatter of the monkeys; the solemn\r\ndeodars, climbing one after another with down-drooped branches; the\r\nvista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them; the incessant twanging\r\nof the tonga-horns and the wild rush of the led horses when a tonga\r\nswung round a curve; the halts for prayers (Mahbub was very religious\r\nin dry-washings and bellowings when time did not press); the evening\r\nconferences by the halting-places, when camels and bullocks chewed\r\nsolemnly together and the stolid drivers told the news of the Road\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese things lifted Kim\xe2\x80\x99s heart to song within him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, when the singing and dancing is done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub Ali, \xe2\x80\x9ccomes\r\nthe Colonel Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s, and that is not so sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fair land\xe2\x80\x94a most beautiful land is this of Hind\xe2\x80\x94and the land of the\r\nFive Rivers is fairer than all,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim half chanted. \xe2\x80\x9cInto it I will go\r\nagain if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or foot against me. Once\r\ngone, who shall find me? Look, Hajji, is yonder the city of Simla?\r\nAllah, what a city!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and he was an old man when Mackerson Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s well\r\nwas new at Peshawur, could recall when there were but two houses in\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla bazar\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncrowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to the Town Hall\r\nat an angle of forty-five. A man who knows his way there can defy all\r\nthe police of India\xe2\x80\x99s summer capital, so cunningly does veranda\r\ncommunicate with veranda, alley-way with alley-way, and bolt-hole with\r\nbolt-hole. Here live those who minister to the wants of the glad\r\ncity\xe2\x80\x94jhampanis who pull the pretty ladies\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9crickshaws by night and\r\ngamble till the dawn; grocers, oil-sellers, curio-vendors,\r\nfirewood-dealers, priests, pickpockets, and native employees of the\r\nGovernment. Here are discussed by courtesans the things which are\r\nsupposed to be profoundest secrets of the India Council; and here\r\ngather all the sub-sub-agents of half the Native States. Here, too,\r\nMahbub Ali rented a room, much more securely locked than his bulkhead\r\nat Lahore, in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer. It was a place\r\nof miracles, too, for there went in at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy,\r\nand there came out an hour later a Eurasian lad\xe2\x80\x94the Lucknow girl\xe2\x80\x99s dye\r\nwas of the best\xe2\x80\x94in badly-fitting shop-clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have spoken with Creighton Sahib,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Mahbub Ali, \xe2\x80\x9cand a second\r\ntime has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of Calamity. He says\r\nthat thou hast altogether wasted sixty days upon the Road, and it is\r\ntoo late, therefore, to send thee to any Hill-school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said that my holidays are my own. I do not go to school twice\r\nover. That is one part of my bond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract. Thou art to lodge\r\nin Lurgan Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s house till it is time to go again to Nucklao.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had sooner lodge with thee, Mahbub.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost not know the honour. Lurgan Sahib himself asked for thee.\r\nThou wilt go up the hill and along the road atop, and there thou must\r\nforget for a while that thou hast ever seen or spoken to me, Mahbub\r\nAli, who sells horses to Creighton Sahib, whom thou dost not know.\r\nRemember this order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand who is Lurgan Sahib? Nay\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he caught\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s sword-keen glance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cindeed I have never heard his name. Is he\r\nby chance\xe2\x80\x94he lowered his voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cone of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat talk is this of _us_, Sahib?\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub Ali returned, in the tone he\r\nused towards Europeans. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Pathan; thou art a Sahib and the son of\r\na Sahib. Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European shops. All Simla\r\nknows it. Ask there ... and, Friend of all the World, he is one to be\r\nobeyed to the last wink of his eyelashes. Men say he does magic, but\r\nthat should not touch thee. Go up the hill and ask. Here begins the\r\nGreat Game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nS\xe2\x80\x99 doaks was son of Yelth the wise\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Chief of the Raven clan.\r\nItswoot the Bear had him in care\r\n    To make him a medicine-man.\r\n\r\nHe was quick and quicker to learn\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Bold and bolder to dare:\r\nHe danced the dread Kloo-Kwallie Dance\r\n    To tickle Itswoot the Bear!\r\n\r\n_Oregon Legend._\r\n\r\nKim flung himself whole-heartedly upon the next turn of the wheel. He\r\nwould be a Sahib again for a while. In that idea, so soon as he had\r\nreached the broad road under Simla Town Hall, he cast about for one to\r\nimpress. A Hindu child, some ten years old, squatted under a lamp-post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s house?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand English,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, and Kim shifted his\r\nspeech accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTogether they set off through the mysterious dusk, full of the noises\r\nof a city below the hillside, and the breath of a cool wind in\r\ndeodar-crowned Jakko, shouldering the stars. The house-lights,\r\nscattered on every level, made, as it were, a double firmament. Some\r\nwere fixed, others belonged to the \xe2\x80\x9crickshaws of the careless,\r\nopen-spoken English folk, going out to dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim\xe2\x80\x99s guide, and halted in a veranda flush with the\r\nmain road. No door stayed them, but a curtain of beaded reeds that\r\nsplit up the lamplight beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, in a voice little louder than a sigh, and\r\nvanished. Kim felt sure that the boy had been posted to guide him from\r\nthe first, but, putting a bold face on it, parted the curtain. A\r\nblack-bearded man, with a green shade over his eyes, sat at a table,\r\nand, one by one, with short, white hands, picked up globules of light\r\nfrom a tray before him, threaded them on a glancing silken string, and\r\nhummed to himself the while. Kim was conscious that beyond the circle\r\nof light the room was full of things that smelt like all the temples of\r\nall the East. A whiff of musk, a puff of sandal-wood, and a breath of\r\nsickly jessamine-oil caught his opened nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim at last, speaking in the vernacular: the smells\r\nmade him forget that he was to be a Sahib.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one,\xe2\x80\x9d the man counted to himself,\r\nstringing pearl after pearl so quickly that Kim could scarcely follow\r\nhis fingers. He slid off the green shade and looked fixedly at Kim for\r\na full half-minute. The pupils of the eye dilated and closed to\r\npin-pricks, as if at will. There was a _faquir_ by the Taksali Gate who\r\nhad just this gift and made money by it, especially when cursing silly\r\nwomen. Kim stared with interest. His disreputable friend could further\r\ntwitch his ears, almost like a goat, and Kim was disappointed that this\r\nnew man could not imitate him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan Sahib suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I fear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt sleep here tonight, and stay with me till it is time to go\r\nagain to Nucklao. It is an order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an order,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where shall I sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, in this room.\xe2\x80\x9d Lurgan Sahib waved his hand towards the darkness\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded and held the lamp above his head. As the light swept them,\r\nthere leaped out from the walls a collection of Tibetan devil-dance\r\nmasks, hanging above the fiend-embroidered draperies of those ghastly\r\nfunctions\xe2\x80\x94horned masks, scowling masks, and masks of idiotic terror. In\r\na corner, a Japanese warrior, mailed and plumed, menaced him with a\r\nhalberd, and a score of lances and _khandas_ and _kuttars_ gave back\r\nthe unsteady gleam. But what interested Kim more than all these\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94he had seen devil-dance masks at the Lahore Museum\xe2\x80\x94was a glimpse\r\nof the soft-eyed Hindu child who had left him in the doorway, sitting\r\ncross-legged under the table of pearls with a little smile on his\r\nscarlet lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that Lurgan Sahib wishes to make me afraid. And I am sure that\r\nthat devil\xe2\x80\x99s brat below the table wishes to see me afraid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cis like a Wonder House. Where is my bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLurgan Sahib pointed to a native quilt in a corner by the loathsome\r\nmasks, picked up the lamp, and left the room black.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that Lurgan Sahib?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim asked as he cuddled down. No answer. He\r\ncould hear the Hindu boy breathing, however, and, guided by the sound,\r\ncrawled across the floor, and cuffed into the darkness, crying: \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nanswer, devil! Is this the way to lie to a Sahib?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a chuckle. It\r\ncould not be his soft-fleshed companion, because he was weeping. So Kim\r\nlifted up his voice and called aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLurgan Sahib! O Lurgan Sahib! Is it an order that thy servant does not\r\nspeak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an order.\xe2\x80\x9d The voice came from behind him and he started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. But remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, as he resought the quilt, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill beat thee in the morning. I do not love Hindus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was no cheerful night; the room being overfull of voices and\r\nmusic. Kim was waked twice by someone calling his name. The second time\r\nhe set out in search, and ended by bruising his nose against a box that\r\ncertainly spoke with a human tongue, but in no sort of human accent. It\r\nseemed to end in a tin trumpet and to be joined by wires to a smaller\r\nbox on the floor\xe2\x80\x94so far, at least, as he could judge by touch. And the\r\nvoice, very hard and whirring, came out of the trumpet. Kim rubbed his\r\nnose and grew furious, thinking, as usual, in Hindi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis with a beggar from the bazar might be good, but\xe2\x80\x94I am a Sahib and\r\nthe son of a Sahib and, which is twice as much more beside, a student\r\nof Nucklao. Yess\xe2\x80\x9d (here he turned to English), \xe2\x80\x9ca boy of St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nDamn Mr Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes!\xe2\x80\x94It is some sort of machinery like a\r\nsewing-machine. Oh, it is a _great_ cheek of him\xe2\x80\x94we are not frightened\r\nthat way at Lucknow\xe2\x80\x94No!\xe2\x80\x9d Then in Hindi: \xe2\x80\x9cBut what does _he_ gain? He is\r\nonly a trader\xe2\x80\x94I am in his shop. But Creighton Sahib is a Colonel\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nthink Creighton Sahib gave orders that it should be done. _How_ I will\r\nbeat that Hindu in the morning! What is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-box was pouring out a string of the most elaborate abuse\r\nthat even Kim had ever heard, in a high uninterested voice, that for a\r\nmoment lifted the short hairs of his neck. When the vile thing drew\r\nbreath, Kim was reassured by the soft, sewing-machine-like whirr.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ch\xc3\xbbp!_ (Be still)\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and again he heard a chuckle that\r\ndecided him. \xe2\x80\x9c_Ch\xc3\xbbp_\xe2\x80\x94or I break your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe box took no heed. Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and something\r\nlifted with a click. He had evidently raised a lid. If there were a\r\ndevil inside, now was its time, for\xe2\x80\x94he sniffed\xe2\x80\x94thus did the\r\nsewing-machines of the bazar smell. He would clean that _shaitan_. He\r\nslipped off his jacket, and plunged it into the box\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Something\r\nlong and round bent under the pressure, there was a whirr and the voice\r\nstopped\xe2\x80\x94as voices must if you ram a thrice-doubled coat on to the wax\r\ncylinder and into the works of an expensive phonograph. Kim finished\r\nhis slumbers with a serene mind.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib-dom. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was\r\na box in the night that gave me bad talk. So I stopped it. Was it your\r\nbox?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShake hands, O\xe2\x80\x99Hara,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was my box. I keep such things\r\nbecause my friends the Rajahs like them. That one is broken, but it was\r\ncheap at the price. Yes, my friends, the Kings, are very fond of\r\ntoys\xe2\x80\x94and so am I sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes. He was a Sahib in\r\nthat he wore Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s clothes; the accent of his Urdu, the intonation of\r\nhis English, showed that he was anything but a Sahib. He seemed to\r\nunderstand what moved in Kim\xe2\x80\x99s mind ere the boy opened his mouth, and\r\nhe took no pains to explain himself as did Father Victor or the Lucknow\r\nmasters. Sweetest of all\xe2\x80\x94he treated Kim as an equal on the Asiatic\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you cannot beat my boy this morning. He says he will kill\r\nyou with a knife or poison. He is jealous, so I have put him in the\r\ncorner and I shall not speak to him today. He has just tried to kill\r\nme. You must help me with the breakfast. He is almost too jealous to\r\ntrust, just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to-do\r\nover this tale. Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was used\r\nto record his little affairs in the North.\r\n\r\nThe back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside, and\r\nthey looked down into their neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 chimney-pots, as is the custom\r\nof Simla. But even more than the purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan\r\nSahib with his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim. The Lahore Museum\r\nwas larger, but here were more wonders\xe2\x80\x94ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels\r\nfrom Tibet; turquoise and raw amber necklaces; green jade bangles;\r\ncuriously packed incense-sticks in jars crusted over with raw garnets;\r\nthe devil-masks of overnight and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies;\r\ngilt figures of Buddha, and little portable lacquer altars; Russian\r\nsamovars with turquoises on the lid; egg-shell china sets in quaint\r\noctagonal cane boxes; yellow ivory crucifixes\xe2\x80\x94from Japan of all places\r\nin the world, so Lurgan Sahib said; carpets in dusty bales, smelling\r\natrociously, pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of geometrical\r\nwork; Persian water-jugs for the hands after meals; dull copper\r\nincense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian, with friezes of fantastic\r\ndevils running round them; tarnished silver belts that knotted like raw\r\nhide; hairpins of jade, ivory, and plasma; arms of all sorts and kinds,\r\nand a thousand other oddments were cased, or piled, or merely thrown\r\ninto the room, leaving a clear space only round the rickety deal table,\r\nwhere Lurgan Sahib worked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose things are nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said his host, following Kim\xe2\x80\x99s glance. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbuy them because they are pretty, and sometimes I sell\xe2\x80\x94if I like the\r\nbuyer\xe2\x80\x99s look. My work is on the table\xe2\x80\x94some of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt blazed in the morning light\xe2\x80\x94all red and blue and green flashes,\r\npicked out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a diamond here and\r\nthere. Kim opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they are quite well, those stones. It will not hurt them to take\r\nthe sun. Besides, they are cheap. But with sick stones it is very\r\ndifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d He piled Kim\xe2\x80\x99s plate anew. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one but _me_ can\r\ndoctor a sick pearl and re-blue turquoises. I grant you opals\xe2\x80\x94any fool\r\ncan cure an opal\xe2\x80\x94but for a sick pearl there is only me. Suppose I were\r\nto die! Then there would be no one ... Oh no! _You_ cannot do anything\r\nwith jewels. It will be quite enough if you understand a little about\r\nthe Turquoise\xe2\x80\x94some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy, porous clay\r\nwater-jug from the filter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim nodded. Lurgan Sahib, fifteen feet off, laid one hand on the jar.\r\nNext instant, it stood at Kim\xe2\x80\x99s elbow, full to within half an inch of\r\nthe brim\xe2\x80\x94the white cloth only showing, by a small wrinkle, where it had\r\nslid into place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim in most utter amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is magic.\xe2\x80\x9d Lurgan\r\nSahib\xe2\x80\x99s smile showed that the compliment had gone home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrow it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will break.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, throw it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim pitched it at random. It fell short and crashed into fifty pieces,\r\nwhile the water dripped through the rough veranda boarding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said it would break.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll one. Look at it. Look at the largest piece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat lay with a sparkle of water in its curve, as it were a star on the\r\nfloor. Kim looked intently. Lurgan Sahib laid one hand gently on the\r\nnape of his neck, stroked it twice or thrice, and whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cLook! It\r\nshall come to life again, piece by piece. First the big piece shall\r\njoin itself to two others on the right and the left\xe2\x80\x94on the right and\r\nthe left. Look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo save his life, Kim could not have turned his head. The light touch\r\nheld him as in a vice, and his blood tingled pleasantly through him.\r\nThere was one large piece of the jar where there had been three, and\r\nabove them the shadowy outline of the entire vessel. He could see the\r\nveranda through it, but it was thickening and darkening with each beat\r\nof his pulse. Yet the jar\xe2\x80\x94how slowly the thoughts came!\xe2\x80\x94the jar had\r\nbeen smashed before his eyes. Another wave of prickling fire raced down\r\nhis neck, as Lurgan Sahib moved his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! It is coming into shape,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan Sahib.\r\n\r\nSo far Kim had been thinking in Hindi, but a tremor came on him, and\r\nwith an effort like that of a swimmer before sharks, who hurls himself\r\nhalf out of the water, his mind leaped up from a darkness that was\r\nswallowing it and took refuge in\xe2\x80\x94the multiplication-table in English!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! It is coming into shape,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Lurgan Sahib.\r\n\r\nThe jar had been smashed\xe2\x80\x94yess, smashed\xe2\x80\x94not the native word, he would\r\nnot think of that\xe2\x80\x94but smashed\xe2\x80\x94into fifty pieces, and twice three was\r\nsix, and thrice three was nine, and four times three was twelve. He\r\nclung desperately to the repetition. The shadow-outline of the jar\r\ncleared like a mist after rubbing eyes. There were the broken shards;\r\nthere was the spilt water drying in the sun, and through the cracks of\r\nthe veranda showed, all ribbed, the white house-wall below\xe2\x80\x94and thrice\r\ntwelve was thirty-six!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! Is it coming into shape?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lurgan Sahib.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is smashed\xe2\x80\x94smashed,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped\xe2\x80\x94Lurgan Sahib had been muttering\r\nsoftly for the last half-minute. Kim wrenched his head aside. \xe2\x80\x9cLook!\r\n_Dekho!_ It is there as it was there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is there as it was there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan, watching Kim closely while\r\nthe boy rubbed his neck. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are the first of many who has ever\r\nseen it so.\xe2\x80\x9d He wiped his broad forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that more magic?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim asked suspiciously. The tingle had gone from\r\nhis veins; he felt unusually wide awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that was not magic. It was only to see if there was\xe2\x80\x94a flaw in a\r\njewel. Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man holds\r\nthem in his hand, and knows the proper way. That is why one must be\r\ncareful before one sets them. Tell me, did you see the shape of the\r\npot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a little time. It began to grow like a flower from the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then what did you do? I mean, how did you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah! I knew it was broken, and so, I think, that was what I\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94and it was broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm! Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I should let it again? I should run\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you are not afraid\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall ask Mahbub\r\nAli\xe2\x80\x94not now, but some day later,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am pleased with\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94yes; and I am pleased with you\xe2\x80\x94no. You are the first that ever\r\nsaved himself. I wish I knew what it was that ... But you are right.\r\nYou should not tell that\xe2\x80\x94not even to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned into the dusky gloom of the shop, and sat down at the table,\r\nrubbing his hands softly. A small, husky sob came from behind a pile of\r\ncarpets. It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall. His\r\nthin shoulders worked with grief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! He is jealous, so jealous. I wonder if he will try to poison me\r\nagain in my breakfast, and make me cook it twice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Kubbee_\xe2\x80\x94_kubbee nahin,_\xe2\x80\x9d came the broken answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whether he will kill this other boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Kubbee\xe2\x80\x94kubbee nahin._\xe2\x80\x9d (Never\xe2\x80\x94never. No!)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do _you_ think he will do?\xe2\x80\x9d He turned suddenly on Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah! I do not know. Let him go, perhaps. Why did he want to poison\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he is so fond of me. Suppose you were fond of someone, and you\r\nsaw someone come, and the man you were fond of was more pleased with\r\nhim than he was with you, what would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim thought. Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the vernacular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not poison that man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should\r\nbeat that boy\xe2\x80\x94_if_ that boy was fond of my man. But first, I would ask\r\nthat boy if it were true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! He thinks everyone must be fond of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I think he is a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nSahib\xe2\x80\x99s son thinks thou art a little fool. Come out, and next time thy\r\nheart is troubled, do not try white arsenic quite so openly. Surely the\r\nDevil Dasim was lord of our table-cloth that day! It might have made me\r\nill, child, and then a stranger would have guarded the jewels. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child, heavy-eyed with much weeping, crept out from behind the bale\r\nand flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s feet, with an\r\nextravagance of remorse that impressed even Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will look into the ink-pools\xe2\x80\x94I will faithfully guard the jewels! Oh,\r\nmy Father and my Mother, send _him_ away!\xe2\x80\x9d He indicated Kim with a\r\nbackward jerk of his bare heel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet\xe2\x80\x94not yet. In a little while he will go away again. But now he\r\nis at school\xe2\x80\x94at a new _madrissah_\xe2\x80\x94and thou shalt be his teacher. Play\r\nthe Play of the Jewels against him. I will keep tally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child dried his tears at once, and dashed to the back of the shop,\r\nwhence he returned with a copper tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Lurgan Sahib. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them come from thy hand, for\r\nhe may say that I knew them before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently\xe2\x80\x94gently,\xe2\x80\x9d the man replied, and from a drawer under the table\r\ndealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, waving an old newspaper. \xe2\x80\x9cLook on them as long\r\nas thou wilt, stranger. Count and, if need be, handle. One look is\r\nenough for _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned his back proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the game?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou canst\r\nremember them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou must tell\r\nover the tally to Lurgan Sahib. _I_ will write mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah!\xe2\x80\x9d The instinct of competition waked in his breast. He bent over\r\nthe tray. There were but fifteen stones on it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nafter a minute. The child slipped the paper over the winking jewels and\r\nscribbled in a native account-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are under that paper five blue stones\xe2\x80\x94one big, one smaller, and\r\nthree small,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, all in haste. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are four green stones, and\r\none with a hole in it; there is one yellow stone that I can see\r\nthrough, and one like a pipe-stem. There are two red stones, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmade the count fifteen, but two I have forgotten. No! Give me time. One\r\nwas of ivory, little and brownish; and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94give me time...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x94two\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten. Kim shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear my count!\xe2\x80\x9d the child burst in, trilling with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\r\nare two flawed sapphires\xe2\x80\x94one of two ruttees and one of four as I should\r\njudge. The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at the edge. There is one\r\nTurkestan turquoise, plain with black veins, and there are two\r\ninscribed\xe2\x80\x94one with a Name of God in gilt, and the other being cracked\r\nacross, for it came out of an old ring, I cannot read. We have now all\r\nfive blue stones. Four flawed emeralds there are, but one is drilled in\r\ntwo places, and one is a little carven\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir weights?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan Sahib impassively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree\xe2\x80\x94five\xe2\x80\x94five\xe2\x80\x94and four ruttees as I judge it. There is one piece of\r\nold greenish pipe amber, and a cut topaz from Europe. There is one ruby\r\nof Burma, of two ruttees, without a flaw, and there is a balas-ruby,\r\nflawed, of two ruttees. There is a carved ivory from China representing\r\na rat sucking an egg; and there is last\xe2\x80\x94ah ha!\xe2\x80\x94a ball of crystal as big\r\nas a bean set on a gold leaf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clapped his hands at the close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is thy master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan Sahib, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! He knew the names of the stones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, flushing. \xe2\x80\x9cTry again!\r\nWith common things such as he and I both know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from the shop,\r\nand even the kitchen, and every time the child won, till Kim marvelled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBind my eyes\xe2\x80\x94let me feel once with my fingers, and even _then_ I will\r\nleave thee opened-eyed behind,\xe2\x80\x9d he challenged.\r\n\r\nKim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were men\xe2\x80\x94or horses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI could do better. This playing\r\nwith tweezers and knives and scissors is too little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLearn first\xe2\x80\x94teach later,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan Sahib. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he thy master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly. But how is it done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy doing it many times over till it is done perfectly\xe2\x80\x94for it is worth\r\ndoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Hindu boy, in highest feather, actually patted Kim on the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not despair,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI myself will teach thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will see that thou art well taught,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan Sahib, still\r\nspeaking in the vernacular, \xe2\x80\x9cfor except my boy here\xe2\x80\x94it was foolish of\r\nhim to buy so much white arsenic when, if he had asked, I could have\r\ngiven it\xe2\x80\x94except my boy here I have not in a long time met with one\r\nbetter worth teaching. And there are ten days more ere thou canst\r\nreturn to Lucknao where they teach nothing\xe2\x80\x94at the long price. We shall,\r\nI think, be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were a most mad ten days, but Kim enjoyed himself too much to\r\nreflect on their craziness. In the morning they played the Jewel\r\nGame\xe2\x80\x94sometimes with veritable stones, sometimes with piles of swords\r\nand daggers, sometimes with photo-graphs of natives. Through the\r\nafternoons he and the Hindu boy would mount guard in the shop, sitting\r\ndumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen and watching Mr Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s many and\r\nvery curious visitors. There were small Rajahs, escorts coughing in the\r\nveranda, who came to buy curiosities\xe2\x80\x94such as phonographs and mechanical\r\ntoys. There were ladies in search of necklaces, and men, it seemed to\r\nKim\xe2\x80\x94but his mind may have been vitiated by early training\xe2\x80\x94in search of\r\nthe ladies; natives from independent and feudatory Courts whose\r\nostensible business was the repair of broken necklaces\xe2\x80\x94rivers of light\r\npoured out upon the table\xe2\x80\x94but whose true end seemed to be to raise\r\nmoney for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs. There were Babus to whom\r\nLurgan Sahib talked with austerity and authority, but at the end of\r\neach interview he gave them money in coined silver and currency notes.\r\nThere were occasional gatherings of long-coated theatrical natives who\r\ndiscussed metaphysics in English and Bengali, to Mr Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\nedification. He was always interested in religions. At the end of the\r\nday, Kim and the Hindu boy\xe2\x80\x94whose name varied at Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure\xe2\x80\x94were\r\nexpected to give a detailed account of all that they had seen and\r\nheard\xe2\x80\x94their view of each man\xe2\x80\x99s character, as shown in his face, talk,\r\nand manner, and their notions of his real errand. After dinner, Lurgan\r\nSahib\xe2\x80\x99s fancy turned more to what might be called dressing-up, in which\r\ngame he took a most informing interest. He could paint faces to a\r\nmarvel; with a brush-dab here and a line there changing them past\r\nrecognition. The shop was full of all manner of dresses and turbans,\r\nand Kim was apparelled variously as a young Mohammedan of good family,\r\nan oilman, and once\xe2\x80\x94which was a joyous evening\xe2\x80\x94as the son of an Oudh\r\nlandholder in the fullest of full dress. Lurgan Sahib had a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\nto detect the least flaw in the make-up; and lying on a worn teak-wood\r\ncouch, would explain by the half-hour together how such and such a\r\ncaste talked, or walked, or coughed, or spat, or sneezed, and, since\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chows\xe2\x80\x9d matter little in this world, the \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\xe2\x80\x9d of everything. The Hindu\r\nchild played this game clumsily. That little mind, keen as an icicle\r\nwhere tally of jewels was concerned, could not temper itself to enter\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s soul; but a demon in Kim woke up and sang with joy as he put\r\non the changing dresses, and changed speech and gesture therewith.\r\n\r\nCarried away by enthusiasm, he volunteered to show Lurgan Sahib one\r\nevening how the disciples of a certain caste of _faquir_, old Lahore\r\nacquaintances, begged doles by the roadside; and what sort of language\r\nhe would use to an Englishman, to a Punjabi farmer going to a fair, and\r\nto a woman without a veil. Lurgan Sahib laughed immensely, and begged\r\nKim to stay as he was, immobile for half an hour\xe2\x80\x94cross-legged,\r\nash-smeared, and wild-eyed, in the back room. At the end of that time\r\nentered a hulking, obese Babu whose stockinged legs shook with fat, and\r\nKim opened on him with a shower of wayside chaff. Lurgan Sahib\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nannoyed Kim\xe2\x80\x94watched the Babu and not the play.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Babu heavily, lighting a cigarette, \xe2\x80\x9cI am of\r\nopeenion that it is most extraordinary and effeecient performance.\r\nExcept that you had told me I should have opined that\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94that you\r\nwere pulling my legs. How soon can he become approximately effeecient\r\nchain-man? Because _then_ I shall indent for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what he must learn at Lucknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen order him to be jolly-dam\xe2\x80\x99-quick. Good-night, Lurgan.\xe2\x80\x9d The Babu\r\nswung out with the gait of a bogged cow.\r\n\r\nWhen they were telling over the day\xe2\x80\x99s list of visitors, Lurgan Sahib\r\nasked Kim who he thought the man might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim cheerily. The tone might almost have deceived\r\nMahbub Ali, but it failed entirely with the healer of sick pearls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true. God, He knows; but I wish to know what you think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim glanced sideways at his companion, whose eye had a way of\r\ncompelling truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I think he will want me when I come from the school,\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94confidentially, as Lurgan Sahib nodded approval\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI do not\r\nunderstand how _he_ can wear many dresses and talk many tongues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt understand many things later. He is a writer of tales for a\r\ncertain Colonel. His honour is great only in Simla, and it is\r\nnoticeable that he has no name, but only a number and a letter\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\na custom among us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is there a price upon his head too\xe2\x80\x94as upon Mah\xe2\x80\x94all the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; but if a boy rose up who is now sitting here and went\xe2\x80\x94look,\r\nthe door is open!\xe2\x80\x94as far as a certain house with a red-painted veranda,\r\nbehind that which was the old theatre in the Lower Bazar, and whispered\r\nthrough the shutters: \xe2\x80\x98Hurree Chunder Mookerjee bore the bad news of\r\nlast month\xe2\x80\x99, that boy might take away a belt full of rupees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred\xe2\x80\x94a thousand\xe2\x80\x94as many as he might ask for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. And for how long might such a boy live after the news was told?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe smiled merrily at Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s very beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! That is to be well thought of. Perhaps if he were very clever, he\r\nmight live out the day\xe2\x80\x94but not the night. By no means the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is the Babu\xe2\x80\x99s pay if so much is put upon his head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighty\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a hundred\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a hundred and fifty rupees; but the\r\npay is the least part of the work. From time to time, God causes men to\r\nbe born\xe2\x80\x94and thou art one of them\xe2\x80\x94who have a lust to go abroad at the\r\nrisk of their lives and discover news\xe2\x80\x94today it may be of far-off\r\nthings, tomorrow of some hidden mountain, and the next day of some\r\nnear-by men who have done a foolishness against the State. These souls\r\nare very few; and of these few, not more than ten are of the best.\r\nAmong these ten I count the Babu, and that is curious. How great,\r\ntherefore, and desirable must be a business that brazens the heart of a\r\nBengali!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. But the days go slowly for me. I am yet a boy, and it is only\r\nwithin two months I learned to write Angrezi. Even now I cannot read it\r\nwell. And there are yet years and years and long years before I can be\r\neven a chain-man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave patience, Friend of all the World\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim started at the title.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould I had a few of the years that so irk thee. I have proved thee in\r\nseveral small ways. This will not be forgotten when I make my report to\r\nthe Colonel Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, changing suddenly into English with a deep\r\nlaugh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, I think there is a great deal in you; but you must\r\nnot become proud and you must not talk. You must go back to Lucknow and\r\nbe a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say, and\r\nperhaps, next holidays if you care, you can come back to me!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface fell. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I mean _if_ you like. I know where you want to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFour days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk at the\r\nrear of a Kalka tonga. His companion was the whale-like Babu, who, with\r\na fringed shawl wrapped round his head, and his fat openwork-stockinged\r\nleft leg tucked under him, shivered and grunted in the morning chill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow comes it that this man is one of _us?_\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kim considering\r\nthe jelly back as they jolted down the road; and the reflection threw\r\nhim into most pleasant day-dreams. Lurgan Sahib had given him five\r\nrupees\xe2\x80\x94a splendid sum\xe2\x80\x94as well as the assurance of his protection if he\r\nworked. Unlike Mahbub, Lurgan Sahib had spoken most explicitly of the\r\nreward that would follow obedience, and Kim was content. If only, like\r\nthe Babu, he could enjoy the dignity of a letter and a number\xe2\x80\x94and a\r\nprice upon his head! Some day he would be all that and more. Some day\r\nhe might be almost as great as Mahbub Ali! The housetops of his search\r\nshould be half India; he would follow Kings and Ministers, as in the\r\nold days he had followed _vakils_ and lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 touts across Lahore city\r\nfor Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Meantime, there was the present, and not at all\r\nunpleasant, fact of St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s immediately before him. There would be\r\nnew boys to condescend to, and there would be tales of holiday\r\nadventures to hear. Young Martin, son of the tea-planter at Manipur,\r\nhad boasted that he would go to war, with a rifle, against the\r\nhead-hunters.\r\n\r\nThat might be, but it was certain young Martin had not been blown half\r\nacross the forecourt of a Patiala palace by an explosion of fireworks;\r\nnor had he... Kim fell to telling himself the story of his own\r\nadventures through the last three months. He could paralyse St\r\nXavier\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94even the biggest boys who shaved\xe2\x80\x94with the recital, were that\r\npermitted. But it was, of course, out of the question. There would be a\r\nprice upon his head in good time, as Lurgan Sahib had assured him; and\r\nif he talked foolishly now, not only would that price never be set, but\r\nColonel Creighton would cast him off\xe2\x80\x94and he would be left to the wrath\r\nof Lurgan Sahib and Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x94for the short space of life that would\r\nremain to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish,\xe2\x80\x9d was his proverbial\r\nphilosophy. It behoved him to forget his holidays (there would always\r\nremain the fun of inventing imaginary adventures) and, as Lurgan Sahib\r\nhad said, to work. Of all the boys hurrying back to St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s, from\r\nSukkur in the sands to Galle beneath the palms, none was so filled with\r\nvirtue as Kimball O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, jiggeting down to Umballa behind Hurree\r\nChunder Mookerjee, whose name on the books of one section of the\r\nEthnological Survey was R.17.\r\n\r\nAnd if additional spur were needed, the Babu supplied it. After a huge\r\nmeal at Kalka, he spoke uninterruptedly. Was Kim going to school? Then\r\nhe, an M A of Calcutta University, would explain the advantages of\r\neducation. There were marks to be gained by due attention to Latin and\r\nWordsworth\xe2\x80\x99s _Excursion_ (all this was Greek to Kim). French, too was\r\nvital, and the best was to be picked up in Chandernagore a few miles\r\nfrom Calcutta. Also a man might go far, as he himself had done, by\r\nstrict attention to plays called _Lear_ and _Julius C\xc3\xa6sar_, both much\r\nin demand by examiners. _Lear_ was not so full of historical allusions\r\nas _Julius C\xc3\xa6sar;_ the book cost four annas, but could be bought\r\nsecond-hand in Bow Bazar for two. Still more important than Wordsworth,\r\nor the eminent authors, Burke and Hare, was the art and science of\r\nmensuration. A boy who had passed his examination in these branches\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nwhich, by the way, there were no cram-books\xe2\x80\x94could, by merely marching\r\nover a country with a compass and a level and a straight eye, carry\r\naway a picture of that country which might be sold for large sums in\r\ncoined silver. But as it was occasionally inexpedient to carry about\r\nmeasuring-chains a boy would do well to know the precise length of his\r\nown foot-pace, so that when he was deprived of what Hurree Chunder\r\ncalled adventitious aids he might still tread his distances. To keep\r\ncount of thousands of paces, Hurree Chunder\xe2\x80\x99s experience had shown him\r\nnothing more valuable than a rosary of eighty-one or a hundred and\r\neight beads, for \xe2\x80\x9cit was divisible and sub-divisible into many\r\nmultiples and sub-multiples\xe2\x80\x9d. Through the volleying drifts of English,\r\nKim caught the general trend of the talk, and it interested him very\r\nmuch. Here was a new craft that a man could tuck away in his head and\r\nby the look of the large wide world unfolding itself before him, it\r\nseemed that the more a man knew the better for him.\r\n\r\nSaid the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half \xe2\x80\x9cI hope some\r\nday to enjoy your offeecial acquaintance. _Ad interim_, if I may be\r\npardoned that expression, I shall give you this betel-box, which is\r\nhighly valuable article and cost me two rupees only four years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nwas a cheap, heart-shaped brass thing with three compartments for\r\ncarrying the eternal betel-nut, lime and _pan_-leaf; but it was filled\r\nwith little tabloid-bottles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is reward of merit for your performance in character of that holy\r\nman. You see, you are so young you think you will last for ever and not\r\ntake care of your body. It is great nuisance to go sick in the middle\r\nof business. I am fond of drugs myself, and they are handy to cure poor\r\npeople too. These are good Departmental drugs\xe2\x80\x94quinine and so on. I give\r\nit you for souvenir. Now good-bye. I have urgent private business here\r\nby the roadside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe slipped out noiselessly as a cat, on the Umballa road, hailed a\r\npassing cart and jingled away, while Kim, tongue-tied, twiddled the\r\nbrass betel-box in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe record of a boy\xe2\x80\x99s education interests few save his parents, and, as\r\nyou know, Kim was an orphan. It is written in the books of St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin Partibus that a report of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s progress was forwarded at the end of\r\neach term to Colonel Creighton and to Father Victor, from whose hands\r\nduly came the money for his schooling. It is further recorded in the\r\nsame books that he showed a great aptitude for mathematical studies as\r\nwell as map-making, and carried away a prize (_The Life of Lord\r\nLawrence_, tree-calf, two vols., nine rupees, eight annas) for\r\nproficiency therein; and the same term played in St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s eleven\r\nagainst the Alighur Mohammedan College, his age being fourteen years\r\nand ten months. He was also re-vaccinated (from which we may assume\r\nthat there had been another epidemic of smallpox at Lucknow) about the\r\nsame time. Pencil notes on the edge of an old muster-roll record that\r\nhe was punished several times for \xe2\x80\x9cconversing with improper persons\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\nand it seems that he was once sentenced to heavy pains for \xe2\x80\x9cabsenting\r\nhimself for a day in the company of a street beggar\xe2\x80\x9d. That was when he\r\ngot over the gate and pleaded with the lama through a whole day down\r\nthe banks of the Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidays\xe2\x80\x94for\r\none month\xe2\x80\x94for a little week; and the lama set his face as a flint\r\nagainst it, averring that the time had not yet come. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s business,\r\nsaid the old man as they ate cakes together, was to get all the wisdom\r\nof the Sahibs and then he would see. The Hand of Friendship must in\r\nsome way have averted the Whip of Calamity, for six weeks later Kim\r\nseems to have passed an examination in elementary surveying \xe2\x80\x9cwith great\r\ncredit\xe2\x80\x9d, his age being fifteen years and eight months. From this date\r\nthe record is silent. His name does not appear in the year\xe2\x80\x99s batch of\r\nthose who entered for the subordinate Survey of India, but against it\r\nstand the words \xe2\x80\x9cremoved on appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral times in those three years, cast up at the Temple of the\r\nTirthankars in Benares the lama, a little thinner and a shade yellower,\r\nif that were possible, but gentle and untainted as ever. Sometimes it\r\nwas from the South that he came\xe2\x80\x94from south of Tuticorin, whence the\r\nwonderful fire-boats go to Ceylon where are priests who know Pali;\r\nsometimes it was from the wet green West and the thousand\r\ncotton-factory chimneys that ring Bombay; and once from the North,\r\nwhere he had doubled back eight hundred miles to talk for a day with\r\nthe Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House. He would stride to his\r\ncell in the cool, cut marble\xe2\x80\x94the priests of the Temple were good to the\r\nold man,\xe2\x80\x94wash off the dust of travel, make prayer, and depart for\r\nLucknow, well accustomed now to the way of the rail, in a third-class\r\ncarriage. Returning, it was noticeable, as his friend the Seeker\r\npointed out to the head-priest, that he ceased for a while to mourn the\r\nloss of his River, or to draw wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life,\r\nbut preferred to talk of the beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious\r\n_chela_ whom no man of the Temple had ever seen. Yes, he had followed\r\nthe traces of the Blessed Feet throughout all India. (The Curator has\r\nstill in his possession a most marvellous account of his wanderings and\r\nmeditations.) There remained nothing more in life but to find the River\r\nof the Arrow. Yet it was shown to him in dreams that it was a matter\r\nnot to be undertaken with any hope of success unless that seeker had\r\nwith him the one _chela_ appointed to bring the event to a happy issue,\r\nand versed in great wisdom\xe2\x80\x94such wisdom as white-haired Keepers of\r\nImages possess. For example (here came out the snuff-gourd, and the\r\nkindly Jain priests made haste to be silent):\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benares\xe2\x80\x94let all listen\r\nto the _J\xc3\xa2taka!_\xe2\x80\x94an elephant was captured for a time by the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhunters and ere he broke free, beringed with a grievous legiron. This\r\nhe strove to remove with hate and frenzy in his heart, and hurrying up\r\nand down the forests, besought his brother-elephants to wrench it\r\nasunder. One by one, with their strong trunks, they tried and failed.\r\nAt the last they gave it as their opinion that the ring was not to be\r\nbroken by any bestial power. And in a thicket, new-born, wet with\r\nmoisture of birth, lay a day-old calf of the herd whose mother had\r\ndied. The fettered elephant, forgetting his own agony, said: \xe2\x80\x98If I do\r\nnot help this suckling it will perish under our feet.\xe2\x80\x99 So he stood\r\nabove the young thing, making his legs buttresses against the uneasily\r\nmoving herd; and he begged milk of a virtuous cow, and the calf throve,\r\nand the ringed elephant was the calf\xe2\x80\x99s guide and defence. Now the days\r\nof an elephant\xe2\x80\x94let all listen to the _J\xc3\xa2taka!_\xe2\x80\x94are thirty-five years to\r\nhis full strength, and through thirty-five Rains the ringed elephant\r\nbefriended the younger, and all the while the fetter ate into the\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen one day the young elephant saw the half-buried iron, and turning\r\nto the elder said: \xe2\x80\x98What is this?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It is even my sorrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said he who\r\nhad befriended him. Then that other put out his trunk and in the\r\ntwinkling of an eyelash abolished the ring, saying: \xe2\x80\x98The appointed time\r\nhas come.\xe2\x80\x99 So the virtuous elephant who had waited temperately and done\r\nkind acts was relieved, at the appointed time, by the very calf whom he\r\nhad turned aside to cherish\xe2\x80\x94let all listen to the _J\xc3\xa2taka!_ for the\r\nElephant was Ananda, and the Calf that broke the ring was none other\r\nthan The Lord Himself...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he would shake his head benignly, and over the ever-clicking\r\nrosary point out how free that elephant-calf was from the sin of pride.\r\nHe was as humble as a _chela_ who, seeing his master sitting in the\r\ndust outside the Gates of Learning, over-leapt the gates (though they\r\nwere locked) and took his master to his heart in the presence of the\r\nproud-stomached city. Rich would be the reward of such a master and\r\nsuch a _chela_ when the time came for them to seek freedom together!\r\n\r\nSo did the lama speak, coming and going across India as softly as a\r\nbat. A sharp-tongued old woman in a house among the fruit-trees behind\r\nSaharunpore honoured him as the woman honoured the prophet, but his\r\nchamber was by no means upon the wall. In an apartment of the forecourt\r\noverlooked by cooing doves he would sit, while she laid aside her\r\nuseless veil and chattered of spirits and fiends of Kulu, of\r\ngrandchildren unborn, and of the free-tongued brat who had talked to\r\nher in the resting-place. Once, too, he strayed alone from the Grand\r\nTrunk Road below Umballa to the very village whose priest had tried to\r\ndrug him; but the kind Heaven that guards lamas sent him at twilight\r\nthrough the crops, absorbed and unsuspicious, to the Rissaldar\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\nHere was like to have been a grave misunderstanding, for the old\r\nsoldier asked him why the Friend of the Stars had gone that way only\r\nsix days before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may not be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone back to his own people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five nights ago,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhis host insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue, he vanished somewhat suddenly in the dawn\r\nafter foolish talk with my granddaughter. He grows apace, but he is the\r\nsame Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of the war. Have ye\r\nparted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and no,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x94we have not altogether parted, but\r\nthe time is not ripe that we should take the Road together. He acquires\r\nwisdom in another place. We must wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll one\xe2\x80\x94but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak so\r\ncontinually of thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what said he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lama eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweet words\xe2\x80\x94an hundred thousand\xe2\x80\x94that thou art his father and mother\r\nand such all. Pity that he does not take the Qpeen\xe2\x80\x99s service. He is\r\nfearless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis news amazed the lama, who did not then know how religiously Kim\r\nkept to the contract made with Mahbub Ali, and perforce ratified by\r\nColonel Creighton...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no holding the young pony from the game,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nhorse-dealer when the Colonel pointed out that vagabonding over India\r\nin holiday time was absurd. \xe2\x80\x9cIf permission be refused to go and come as\r\nhe chooses, he will make light of the refusal. Then who is to catch\r\nhim? Colonel Sahib, only once in a thousand years is a horse born so\r\nwell fitted for the game as this our colt. And we need men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nYour tiercel\xe2\x80\x99s too long at hack, Sire. He\xe2\x80\x99s no eyass\r\nBut a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him,\r\nDangerously free o\xe2\x80\x99 the air. Faith! were he mine\r\n(As mine\xe2\x80\x99s the glove he binds to for his tirings)\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d fly him with a make-hawk. He\xe2\x80\x99s in yarak\r\nPlumed to the very point\xe2\x80\x94so manned, so weathered...\r\nGive him the firmament God made him for,\r\nAnd what shall take the air of him?\xe2\x80\x94_Old Play._\r\n\r\nLurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech, but his advice tallied with\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s; and the upshot was good for Kim. He knew better now than to\r\nleave Lucknow city in native garb, and if Mahbub were anywhere within\r\nreach of a letter, it was to Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s camp he headed, and made his\r\nchange under the Pathan\xe2\x80\x99s wary eye. Could the little Survey paint-box\r\nthat he used for map-tinting in term-time have found a tongue to tell\r\nof holiday doings, he might have been expelled. Once Mahbub and he went\r\ntogether as far as the beautiful city of Bombay, with three truckloads\r\nof tram-horses, and Mahbub nearly melted when Kim proposed a sail in a\r\ndhow across the Indian Ocean to buy Gulf Arabs, which, he understood\r\nfrom a hanger-on of the dealer Abdul Rahman, fetched better prices than\r\nmere Kabulis.\r\n\r\nHe dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub and\r\na few co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner. They came back\r\nby way of Karachi by sea, when Kim took his first experience of\r\nsea-sickness sitting on the fore-hatch of a coasting-steamer, well\r\npersuaded he had been poisoned. The Babu\xe2\x80\x99s famous drug-box proved\r\nuseless, though Kim had restocked it at Bombay. Mahbub had business at\r\nQuetta, and there Kim, as Mahbub admitted, earned his keep, and perhaps\r\na little over, by spending four curious days as scullion in the house\r\nof a fat Commissariat sergeant, from whose office-box, in an auspicious\r\nmoment, he removed a little vellum ledger which he copied out\xe2\x80\x94it seemed\r\nto deal entirely with cattle and camel sales\xe2\x80\x94by moonlight, lying behind\r\nan outhouse, all through one hot night. Then he returned the ledger to\r\nits place, and, at Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s word, left that service unpaid, rejoining\r\nhim six miles down the road, the clean copy in his bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat soldier is a small fish,\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub Ali explained, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in time we\r\nshall catch the larger one. He only sells oxen at two prices\xe2\x80\x94one for\r\nhimself and one for the Government\xe2\x80\x94which I do not think is a sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy could not I take away the little book and be done with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he would have been frightened, and he would have told his master.\r\nThen we should miss, perhaps, a great number of new rifles which seek\r\ntheir way up from Quetta to the North. The Game is so large that one\r\nsees but a little at a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, and held his tongue. That was in the monsoon holidays,\r\nafter he had taken the prize for mathematics. The Christmas holidays he\r\nspent\xe2\x80\x94deducting ten days for private amusements\xe2\x80\x94with Lurgan Sahib,\r\nwhere he sat for the most part in front of a roaring wood-fire\xe2\x80\x94Jakko\r\nroad was four feet deep in snow that year\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94the small Hindu had gone\r\naway to be married\xe2\x80\x94helped Lurgan to thread pearls. He made Kim learn\r\nwhole chapters of the Koran by heart, till he could deliver them with\r\nthe very roll and cadence of a mullah. Moreover, he told Kim the names\r\nand properties of many native drugs, as well as the runes proper to\r\nrecite when you administer them. And in the evenings he wrote charms on\r\nparchment\xe2\x80\x94elaborate pentagrams crowned with the names of devils\xe2\x80\x94Murra,\r\nand Awan the Companion of Kings\xe2\x80\x94all fantastically written in the\r\ncorners. More to the point, he advised Kim as to the care of his own\r\nbody, the cure of fever-fits, and simple remedies of the Road. A week\r\nbefore it was time to go down, Colonel Creighton Sahib\xe2\x80\x94this was\r\nunfair\xe2\x80\x94sent Kim a written examination paper that concerned itself\r\nsolely with rods and chains and links and angles.\r\n\r\nNext holidays he was out with Mahbub, and here, by the way, he nearly\r\ndied of thirst, plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious\r\ncity of Bikanir, where the wells are four hundred feet deep, and lined\r\nthroughout with camel-bone. It was not an amusing trip from Kim\xe2\x80\x99s point\r\nof view, because\xe2\x80\x94in defiance of the contract\xe2\x80\x94the Colonel ordered him to\r\nmake a map of that wild, walled city; and since Mohammedan horse-boys\r\nand pipe-tenders are not expected to drag Survey-chains round the\r\ncapital of an independent Native State, Kim was forced to pace all his\r\ndistances by means of a bead rosary. He used the compass for bearings\r\nas occasion served\xe2\x80\x94after dark chiefly, when the camels had been fed\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nby the help of his little Survey paint-box of six colour-cakes and\r\nthree brushes, he achieved something not remotely unlike the city of\r\nJeysulmir. Mahbub laughed a great deal, and advised him to make up a\r\nwritten report as well; and in the back of the big account-book that\r\nlay under the flap of Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s pet saddle Kim fell to work..\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must hold everything that thou hast seen or touched or considered.\r\nWrite as though the Jung-i-Lat Sahib himself had come by stealth with a\r\nvast army outsetting to war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow great an army?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, half a lakh of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolly! Remember how few and bad were the wells in the sand. Not a\r\nthousand thirsty men could come near by here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen write that down\xe2\x80\x94also all the old breaches in the walls and whence\r\nthe firewood is cut\xe2\x80\x94and what is the temper and disposition of the King.\r\nI stay here till all my horses are sold. I will hire a room by the\r\ngateway, and thou shalt be my accountant. There is a good lock to the\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe report in its unmistakable St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s running script, and the\r\nbrown, yellow, and lake-daubed map, was on hand a few years ago (a\r\ncareless clerk filed it with the rough notes of E\xe2\x80\x99s second Seistan\r\nsurvey), but by now the pencil characters must be almost illegible. Kim\r\ntranslated it, sweating under the light of an oil-lamp, to Mahbub, the\r\nsecond day of their return-journey.\r\n\r\nThe Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle-bags.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it would be worthy a dress of honour, and so I made one ready,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWere I Amir of Afghanistan (and some day we may see\r\nhim), I would fill thy mouth with gold.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid the garments formally\r\nat Kim\xe2\x80\x99s feet. There was a gold-embroidered Peshawur turban-cap, rising\r\nto a cone, and a big turban-cloth ending in a broad fringe of gold.\r\nThere was a Delhi embroidered waistcoat to slip over a milky white\r\nshirt, fastening to the right, ample and flowing; green pyjamas with\r\ntwisted silk waist-string; and that nothing might be lacking,\r\nrussia-leather slippers, smelling divinely, with arrogantly curled\r\ntips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon a Wednesday, and in the morning, to put on new clothes is\r\nauspicious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we must not forget the wicked\r\nfolk in the world. So!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe capped all the splendour, that was taking Kim\xe2\x80\x99s delighted breath\r\naway, with a mother-of-pearl, nickel-plated, self-extracting .450\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had thought of a smaller bore, but reflected that this takes\r\nGovernment bullets. A man can always come by those\xe2\x80\x94especially across\r\nthe Border. Stand up and let me look.\xe2\x80\x9d He clapped Kim on the shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay you never be tired, Pathan! Oh, the hearts to be broken! Oh, the\r\neyes under the eyelashes, looking sideways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim turned about, pointed his toes, stretched, and felt mechanically\r\nfor the moustache that was just beginning. Then he stooped towards\r\nMahbub\xe2\x80\x99s feet to make proper acknowledgment with fluttering,\r\nquick-patting hands; his heart too full for words. Mahbub forestalled\r\nand embraced him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son, said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat need of words between us? But is not the little\r\ngun a delight? All six cartridges come out at one twist. It is borne in\r\nthe bosom next the skin, which, as it were, keeps it oiled. Never put\r\nit elsewhere, and please God, thou shalt some day kill a man with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hai mai!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim ruefully. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a Sahib kills a man he is hanged in\r\nthe jail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue: but one pace beyond the Border, men are wiser. Put it away; but\r\nfill it first. Of what use is a gun unfed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I go back to the _madrissah_ I must return it. They do not allow\r\nlittle guns. Thou wilt keep it for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSon, I am wearied of that _madrissah_, where they take the best years\r\nof a man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road. The folly\r\nof the Sahibs has neither top nor bottom. No matter. Maybe thy written\r\nreport shall save thee further bondage; and God He knows we need men\r\nmore and more in the Game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey marched, jaw-bound against blowing sand, across the salt desert to\r\nJodhpur, where Mahbub and his handsome nephew Habib Ullah did much\r\ntrading; and then sorrowfully, in European clothes, which he was fast\r\noutgrowing, Kim went second-class to St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s. Three weeks later,\r\nColonel Creighton, pricing Tibetan ghost-daggers at Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\r\nfaced Mahbub Ali openly mutinous. Lurgan Sahib operated as support in\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pony is made\xe2\x80\x94finished\xe2\x80\x94mouthed and paced, Sahib! From now on, day\r\nby day, he will lose his manners if he is kept at tricks. Drop the rein\r\non his back and let go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the horse-dealer. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is so young, Mahbub\xe2\x80\x94not more than sixteen\xe2\x80\x94is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was fifteen, I had shot my man and begot my man, Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou impenitent old heathen!\xe2\x80\x9d Creighton turned to Lurgan. The black\r\nbeard nodded assent to the wisdom of the Afghan\xe2\x80\x99s dyed scarlet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ should have used him long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan. \xe2\x80\x9cThe younger the\r\nbetter. That is why I always have my really valuable jewels watched by\r\na child. You sent him to me to try. I tried him in every way: he is the\r\nonly boy I could not make to see things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the crystal\xe2\x80\x94in the ink-pool?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mahbub.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Under my hand, as I told you. That has never happened before. It\r\nmeans that he is strong enough\xe2\x80\x94but you think it skittles, Colonel\r\nCreighton\xe2\x80\x94to make anyone do anything he wants. And that is three years\r\nago. I have taught him a good deal since, Colonel Creighton. I think\r\nyou waste him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHmm! Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re right. But, as you know, there is no Survey work for\r\nhim at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him out let him go,\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cWho expects any colt to\r\ncarry heavy weight at first? Let him run with the caravans\xe2\x80\x94like our\r\nwhite camel-colts\xe2\x80\x94for luck. I would take him myself, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a little business where he would be most useful\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nSouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan, with peculiar suavity, dropping his heavy blued\r\neyelids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cE.23 has that in hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Creighton quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must not go down\r\nthere. Besides, he knows no Turki.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want and he\r\nwill bring them back,\xe2\x80\x9d Lurgan insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. That is a man\xe2\x80\x99s job,\xe2\x80\x9d said Creighton.\r\n\r\nIt was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary\r\ncorrespondence between a person who claimed to be the ultimate\r\nauthority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout the\r\nworld, and a younger member of a royal house who had been brought to\r\nbook for kidnapping women within British territory. The Moslem\r\nArchbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant; the young prince was\r\nmerely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges, but there was no\r\nneed he should continue a correspondence which might some day\r\ncompromise him. One letter indeed had been procured, but the finder was\r\nlater found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader, as\r\nE.23, taking up the work, duly reported.\r\n\r\nThese facts, and a few others not to be published, made both Mahbub and\r\nCreighton shake their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him go out with his Red Lama,\xe2\x80\x9d said the horse-dealer with visible\r\neffort. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is fond of the old man. He can learn his paces by the\r\nrosary at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had some dealings with the old man\xe2\x80\x94by letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colonel\r\nCreighton, smiling to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhither goes he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp and down the land, as he has these three years. He seeks a River of\r\nHealing. God\xe2\x80\x99s curse upon all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub checked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe beds down\r\nat the Temple of the Tirthankars or at Buddh Gaya when he is in from\r\nthe Road. Then he goes to see the boy at the _madrissah_, as we know\r\nfor the boy was punished for it twice or thrice. He is quite mad, but a\r\npeaceful man. I have met him. The Babu also has had dealings with him.\r\nWe have watched him for three years. Red Lamas are not so common in\r\nHind that one loses track.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBabus are very curious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lurgan meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what\r\nHurree Babu really wants? He wants to be made a member of the Royal\r\nSociety by taking ethnological notes. I tell you, I tell him about the\r\nlama everything which Mahbub and the boy have told me. Hurree Babu goes\r\ndown to Benares\xe2\x80\x94at his own expense, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Creighton briefly. He had paid Hurree\xe2\x80\x99s travelling\r\nexpenses, out of a most lively curiosity to learn what the lama might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he applies to the lama for information on lamaism, and\r\ndevil-dances, and spells and charms, several times in these few years.\r\nHoly Virgin! I could have told him all that yeears ago. I think Hurree\r\nBabu is getting too old for the Road. He likes better to collect\r\nmanners and customs information. Yes, he wants to be an FRS.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurree thinks well of the boy, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very indeed\xe2\x80\x94we have had some pleasant evenings at my little\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94but I think it would be waste to throw him away with Hurree on\r\nthe Ethnological side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for a first experience. How does that strike you, Mahbub? Let the\r\nboy run with the lama for six months. After that we can see. He will\r\nget experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has it already, Sahib\xe2\x80\x94as a fish controls the water he swims in. But\r\nfor every reason it will be well to loose him from the school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Creighton, half to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can go with the\r\nlama, and if Hurree Babu cares to keep an eye on them so much the\r\nbetter. He won\xe2\x80\x99t lead the boy into any danger as Mahbub would.\r\nCurious\xe2\x80\x94his wish to be an F R S. Very human, too. He _is_ best on the\r\nEthnological side\xe2\x80\x94Hurree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo money and no preferment would have drawn Creighton from his work on\r\nthe Indian Survey, but deep in his heart also lay the ambition to write\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cF R S\xe2\x80\x9d after his name. Honours of a sort he knew could be obtained by\r\ningenuity and the help of friends, but, to the best of his belief,\r\nnothing save work\xe2\x80\x94papers representing a life of it\xe2\x80\x94took a man into the\r\nSociety which he had bombarded for years with monographs on strange\r\nAsiatic cults and unknown customs. Nine men out of ten would flee from\r\na Royal Society soiree in extremity of boredom; but Creighton was the\r\ntenth, and at times his soul yearned for the crowded rooms in easy\r\nLondon where silver-haired, bald-headed gentlemen who know nothing of\r\nthe Army move among spectroscopic experiments, the lesser plants of the\r\nfrozen tundras, electric flight-measuring machines, and apparatus for\r\nslicing into fractional millimetres the left eye of the female\r\nmosquito. By all right and reason, it was the Royal Geographical that\r\nshould have appealed to him, but men are as chancy as children in their\r\nchoice of playthings. So Creighton smiled, and thought the better of\r\nHurree Babu, moved by like desire.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the ghost-dagger and looked up at Mahbub.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow soon can we get the colt from the stable?\xe2\x80\x9d said the horse-dealer,\r\nreading his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHmm! If I withdraw him by order now\xe2\x80\x94what will he do, think you? I have\r\nnever before assisted at the teaching of such an one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will come to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cLurgan Sahib and I will\r\nprepare him for the Road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it, then. For six months he shall run at his choice. But who\r\nwill be his sponsor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLurgan slightly inclined his head. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will not tell anything, if that\r\nis what you are afraid of, Colonel Creighton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only a boy, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-es; but first, he has nothing to tell; and secondly, he knows what\r\nwould happen. Also, he is very fond of Mahbub, and of me a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he draw pay?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the practical horse-dealer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFood and water allowance only. Twenty rupees a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no worrying audit.\r\nThat Service is ludicrously starved, of course, but the funds are\r\nadministered by a few men who do not call for vouchers or present\r\nitemized accounts. Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s eyes lighted with almost a Sikh\xe2\x80\x99s love of\r\nmoney. Even Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s impassive face changed. He considered the years to\r\ncome when Kim would have been entered and made to the Great Game that\r\nnever ceases day and night, throughout India. He foresaw honour and\r\ncredit in the mouths of a chosen few, coming to him from his pupil.\r\nLurgan Sahib had made E.23 what E.23 was, out of a bewildered,\r\nimpertinent, lying, little North-West Province man.\r\n\r\nBut the joy of these masters was pale and smoky beside the joy of Kim\r\nwhen St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s Head called him aside, with word that Colonel\r\nCreighton had sent for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, that he has found you a place as an assistant\r\nchain-man in the Canal Department: that comes of taking up mathematics.\r\nIt is great luck for you, for you are only sixteen; but of course you\r\nunderstand that you do not become _pukka_ (permanent) till you have\r\npassed the autumn examination. So you must not think you are going out\r\ninto the world to enjoy yourself, or that your fortune is made. There\r\nis a great deal of hard work before you. Only, if you succeed in\r\nbecoming _pukka_, you can rise, you know, to four hundred and fifty a\r\nmonth.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereat the Principal gave him much good advice as to his\r\nconduct, and his manners, and his morals; and others, his elders, who\r\nhad not been wafted into billets, talked as only Anglo-Indian lads can,\r\nof favouritism and corruption. Indeed, young Cazalet, whose father was\r\na pensioner at Chunar, hinted very broadly that Colonel Creighton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest in Kim was directly paternal; and Kim, instead of retaliating,\r\ndid not even use language. He was thinking of the immense fun to come,\r\nof Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s letter of the day before, all neatly written in English,\r\nmaking appointment for that afternoon in a house the very name of which\r\nwould have crisped the Principal\xe2\x80\x99s hair with horror...\r\n\r\nSaid Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow railway station that evening, above the\r\nluggage-scales: \xe2\x80\x9cI feared lest at the last, the roof would fall upon me\r\nand cheat me. It is indeed all finished, O my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahbub snapped his fingers to show the utterness of that end, and his\r\neyes blazed like red coals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where is the pistol that I may wear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly! A half-year, to run without heel-ropes. I begged that much\r\nfrom Colonel Creighton Sahib. At twenty rupees a month. Old Red Hat\r\nknows that thou art coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will pay thee _dustoorie_ (commission) on my pay for three months,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Kim gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cYea, two rupees a month. But first we must get rid\r\nof these.\xe2\x80\x9d He plucked his thin linen trousers and dragged at his\r\ncollar. \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought with me all that I need on the Road. My trunk\r\nhas gone up to Lurgan Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sends his salaams to thee\xe2\x80\x94Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLurgan Sahib is a very clever man. But what dost thou do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go North again, upon the Great Game. What else? Is thy mind still\r\nset on following old Red Hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not forget he made me that I am\xe2\x80\x94though he did not know it. Year by\r\nyear, he sent the money that taught me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have done as much\xe2\x80\x94had it struck my thick head,\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub\r\ngrowled. \xe2\x80\x9cCome away. The lamps are lit now, and none will mark thee in\r\nthe bazar. We go to Huneefa\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the way thither, Mahbub gave him much the same sort of advice as his\r\nmother gave to Lemuel, and curiously enough, Mahbub was exact to point\r\nout how Huneefa and her likes destroyed kings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he quoted maliciously, \xe2\x80\x9cone who said, \xe2\x80\x98Trust a snake\r\nbefore an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.\xe2\x80\x99 Now,\r\nexcepting as to Pathans, of whom I am one, all that is true. Most true\r\nis it in the Great Game, for it is by means of women that all plans\r\ncome to ruin and we lie out in the dawning with our throats cut. So it\r\nhappened to such a one.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave the reddest particulars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim paused before a filthy staircase that climbed to the\r\nwarm darkness of an upper chamber, in the ward that is behind Azim\r\nUllah\xe2\x80\x99s tobacco-shop. Those who know it call it The Birdcage\xe2\x80\x94it is so\r\nfull of whisperings and whistlings and chirrupings.\r\n\r\nThe room, with its dirty cushions and half-smoked hookahs, smelt\r\nabominably of stale tobacco. In one corner lay a huge and shapeless\r\nwoman clad in greenish gauzes, and decked, brow, nose, ear, neck,\r\nwrist, arm, waist, and ankle with heavy native jewellery. When she\r\nturned it was like the clashing of copper pots. A lean cat in the\r\nbalcony outside the window mewed hungrily. Kim checked, bewildered, at\r\nthe door-curtain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the new stuff, Mahbub?\xe2\x80\x9d said Huneefa lazily, scarce troubling\r\nto remove the mouthpiece from her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cO Buktanoos!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94like most of her\r\nkind, she swore by the Djinns\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO Buktanoos! He is very good to look\r\nupon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is part of the selling of the horse,\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub explained to Kim,\r\nwho laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard that talk since my Sixth Day,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, squatting by\r\nthe light. \xe2\x80\x9cWhither does it lead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo protection. Tonight we change thy colour. This sleeping under roofs\r\nhas blanched thee like an almond. But Huneefa has the secret of a\r\ncolour that catches. No painting of a day or two. Also, we fortify thee\r\nagainst the chances of the Road. That is _my_ gift to thee, my son.\r\nTake out all metals on thee and lay them here. Make ready, Huneefa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim dragged forth his compass, Survey paint-box, and the new-filled\r\nmedicine-box. They had all accompanied his travels, and boylike he\r\nvalued them immensely.\r\n\r\nThe woman rose slowly and moved with her hands a little spread before\r\nher. Then Kim saw that she was blind. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nPathan speaks truth\xe2\x80\x94my colour does not go in a week or a month, and\r\nthose whom I protect are under strong guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one is far off and alone, it would not be well to grow blotched\r\nand leprous of a sudden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen thou wast with me I could\r\noversee the matter. Besides, a Pathan is a fair-skin. Strip to the\r\nwaist now and look how thou art whitened.\xe2\x80\x9d Huneefa felt her way back\r\nfrom an inner room. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no matter, she cannot see.\xe2\x80\x9d He took a pewter\r\nbowl from her ringed hand.\r\n\r\nThe dye-stuff showed blue and gummy. Kim experimented on the back of\r\nhis wrist, with a dab of cotton-wool; but Huneefa heard him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing is not done thus, but with the proper\r\nceremonies. The colouring is the least part. I give thee the full\r\nprotection of the Road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Jadoo?_ (magic),\xe2\x80\x9dsaid Kim, with a half start. He did not like the\r\nwhite, sightless eyes. Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s hand on his neck bowed him to the\r\nfloor, nose within an inch of the boards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe still. No harm comes to thee, my son. I am thy sacrifice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not see what the woman was about, but heard the dish-clash of\r\nher jewellery for many minutes. A match lit up the darkness; he caught\r\nthe well-known purr and fizzle of grains of incense. Then the room\r\nfilled with smoke\xe2\x80\x94heavy aromatic, and stupefying. Through growing\r\ndrowse he heard the names of devils\xe2\x80\x94of Zulbazan, Son of Eblis, who\r\nlives in bazars and _paraos_, making all the sudden lewd wickedness of\r\nwayside halts; of Dulhan, invisible about mosques, the dweller among\r\nthe slippers of the faithful, who hinders folk from their prayers; and\r\nMusboot, Lord of lies and panic. Huneefa, now whispering in his ear,\r\nnow talking as from an immense distance, touched him with horrible soft\r\nfingers, but Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s grip never shifted from his neck till, relaxing\r\nwith a sigh, the boy lost his senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah! How he fought! We should never have done it but for the drugs.\r\nThat was his white blood, I take it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub testily. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on with\r\nthe _dawut_ (invocation). Give him full Protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_O Hearer! Thou that hearest with ears, be present. Listen, O\r\nHearer!_\xe2\x80\x9d Huneefa moaned, her dead eyes turned to the west. The dark\r\nroom filled with moanings and snortings.\r\n\r\nFrom the outer balcony, a ponderous figure raised a round bullet head\r\nand coughed nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not interrupt this ventriloquial necromanciss, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d it said\r\nin English. \xe2\x80\x9cI opine that it is very disturbing to you, but no\r\nenlightened observer is jolly-well upset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c..._I will lay a plot for their ruin! O Prophet, bear with the\r\nunbelievers. Let them alone awhile!_\xe2\x80\x9d Huneefa\xe2\x80\x99s face, turned to the\r\nnorthward, worked horribly, and it was as though voices from the\r\nceiling answered her.\r\n\r\nHurree Babu returned to his note-book, balanced on the window-sill, but\r\nhis hand shook. Huneefa, in some sort of drugged ecstasy, wrenched\r\nherself to and fro as she sat cross-legged by Kim\xe2\x80\x99s still head, and\r\ncalled upon devil after devil, in the ancient order of the ritual,\r\nbinding them to avoid the boy\xe2\x80\x99s every action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_With Him are the keys of the Secret Things! None knoweth them besides\r\nHimself He knoweth that which is in the dry land and in the sea!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAgain broke out the unearthly whistling responses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I apprehend it is not at all malignant in its operation?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBabu, watching the throat-muscles quiver and jerk as Huneefa spoke with\r\ntongues. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x94it is not likely that she has killed the boy? If so, I\r\ndecline to be witness at the trial .....What was the last hypothetical\r\ndevil mentioned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBabuji,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub in the vernacular. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no regard for the\r\ndevils of Hind, but the Sons of Eblis are far otherwise, and whether\r\nthey be _jumalee_ (well-affected) or _jullalee_ (terrible) they love\r\nnot Kafirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you think I had better go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hurree Babu, half rising. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nare, of course, dematerialized phenomena. Spencer says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHuneefa\xe2\x80\x99s crisis passed, as these things must, in a paroxysm of\r\nhowling, with a touch of froth at the lips. She lay spent and\r\nmotionless beside Kim, and the crazy voices ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWah! That work is done. May the boy be better for it; and Huneefa is\r\nsurely a mistress of _dawut_. Help haul her aside, Babu. Do not be\r\nafraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to fear the absolutely non-existent?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hurree Babu,\r\ntalking English to reassure himself. It is an awful thing still to\r\ndread the magic that you contemptuously investigate\xe2\x80\x94to collect\r\nfolk-lore for the Royal Society with a lively belief in all Powers of\r\nDarkness.\r\n\r\nMahbub chuckled. He had been out with Hurree on the Road ere now. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nus finish the colouring,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy is well protected if\xe2\x80\x94if the\r\nLords of the Air have ears to hear. I am a _sufi_ (free-thinker), but\r\nwhen one can get blind-sides of a woman, a stallion, or a devil, why go\r\nround to invite a kick? Set him upon the way, Babu, and see that old\r\nRed Hat does not lead him beyond our reach. I must get back to my\r\nhorses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll raight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hurree Babu. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is at present curious spectacle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout third cockcrow, Kim woke after a sleep of thousands of years.\r\nHuneefa, in her corner, snored heavily, but Mahbub was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you were not frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d said an oily voice at his elbow. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuperintended entire operation, which was most interesting from\r\nethnological point of view. It was high-class _dawut_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, recognizing Hurree Babu, who smiled ingratiatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd also I had honour to bring down from Lurgan your present costume.\r\nI am not in the habit offeecially of carrying such gauds to\r\nsubordinates, but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he giggled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyour case is noted as exceptional on the\r\nbooks. I hope Mr Lurgan will note my action.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim yawned and stretched himself. It was good to turn and twist within\r\nloose clothes once again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked curiously at the heavy duffle-stuff loaded\r\nwith the scents of the far North.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! That is inconspicuous dress of _chela_ attached to service of\r\nlamaistic lama. _Com_plete in every particular,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hurree Babu,\r\nrolling into the balcony to clean his teeth at a goglet. \xe2\x80\x9cI am of\r\nopeenion it is not your old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s precise releegion, but rather\r\nsub-variant of same. I have contributed rejected notes To Whom It May\r\nConcern: _Asiatic Quarterly Review_ on these subjects. Now it is\r\ncurious that the old gentleman himself is totally devoid of\r\nreleegiosity. He is not a dam\xe2\x80\x99 particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHurree Babu held up his hand to show he was engaged in the prescribed\r\nrites that accompany tooth-cleaning and such things among decently bred\r\nBengalis. Then he recited in English an Arya-Somaj prayer of a\r\ntheistical nature, and stuffed his mouth with _pan_ and betel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah yes. I have met him several times at Benares, and also at Buddh\r\nGaya, to interrogate him on releegious points and devil-worship. He is\r\npure agnostic\xe2\x80\x94same as me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHuneefa stirred in her sleep, and Hurree Babu jumped nervously to the\r\ncopper incense-burner, all black and discoloured in morning-light,\r\nrubbed a finger in the accumulated lamp-black, and drew it diagonally\r\nacross his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has died in thy house?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kim in the vernacular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone. But she may have the Evil Eye\xe2\x80\x94that sorceress,\xe2\x80\x9d the Babu replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou do now, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will set thee on thy way to Benares, if thou goest thither, and tell\r\nthee what must be known by Us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go. At what hour runs the _te-rain?_\xe2\x80\x9d He rose to his feet, looked\r\nround the desolate chamber and at the yellow-wax face of Huneefa as the\r\nlow sun stole across the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there money to be paid that witch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. She has charmed thee against all devils and all dangers in the\r\nname of her devils. It was Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s desire.\xe2\x80\x9d In English: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is highly\r\nobsolete, _I_ think, to indulge in such supersteetion. Why, it is all\r\nventri_lo_quy. Belly-speak\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim snapped his fingers mechanically to avert whatever evil\xe2\x80\x94Mahbub, he\r\nknew, meditated none\xe2\x80\x94might have crept in through Huneefa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nministrations; and Hurree giggled once more. But as he crossed the room\r\nhe was careful not to step in Huneefa\xe2\x80\x99s blotched, squat shadow on the\r\nboards. Witches\xe2\x80\x94when their time is on them\xe2\x80\x94can lay hold of the heels of\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s soul if he does that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you must well listen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Babu when they were in the fresh\r\nair. \xe2\x80\x9cPart of these ceremonies which we witnessed they include supply\r\nof effeecient amulet to those of our Department. If you feel in your\r\nneck you will find one small silver amulet, verree cheap. That is\r\n_ours_. Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah yes, _hawa-dilli_ (a heart-lifter),\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, feeling at his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuneefa she makes them for two rupees twelve annas with\xe2\x80\x94oh, all sorts\r\nof exorcisms. They are quite common, except they are partially black\r\nenamel, and there is a paper inside each one full of names of local\r\nsaints and such things. _Thatt_ is Huneefa\xe2\x80\x99s look-out, you see? Huneefa\r\nmakes them onlee for us, but in case she does not, when we get them we\r\nput in, before issue, one small piece of turquoise. Mr Lurgan he gives\r\nthem. There is no other source of supply; but it was me invented all\r\nthis. It is strictly unoffeecial of course, but convenient for\r\nsubordinates. Colonel Creighton he does not know. He is European. The\r\nturquoise is wrapped in the paper ... Yes, that is road to railway\r\nstation ... Now suppose you go with the lama, or with me, I hope, some\r\nday, or with Mahbub. Suppose we get into a dam\xe2\x80\x99-tight place. I am a\r\nfearful man\xe2\x80\x94most fearful\xe2\x80\x94but I tell you I have been in dam\xe2\x80\x99-tight\r\nplaces more than hairs on my head. You say: \xe2\x80\x98I am Son of the Charm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nVerree good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand quite. We must not be heard talking English here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all raight. I am only Babu showing off my English to you. All\r\nwe Babus talk English to show off;\xe2\x80\x9d said Hurree, flinging his\r\nshoulder-cloth jauntily. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I was about to say, \xe2\x80\x98Son of the Charm\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmeans that you may be member of the _Sat Bhai_\xe2\x80\x94the Seven Brothers,\r\nwhich is Hindi _and_ Tantric. It is popularly supposed to be extinct\r\nSociety, but I have written notes to show it is still extant. You see,\r\nit is all my invention. Verree good. _Sat Bhai_ has many members, and\r\nperhaps before they jolly-well-cut-your-throat they may give you just a\r\nchance of life. That is useful, anyhow. And moreover, these foolish\r\nnatives\xe2\x80\x94if they are not too excited\xe2\x80\x94they always stop to think before\r\nthey kill a man who says he belongs to any speecific organization. You\r\nsee? You say then when you are in tight place, \xe2\x80\x98I am Son of the Charm\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nand you get\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94your second wind. That is only in extreme\r\ninstances, or to open negotiations with a stranger. Can you quite see?\r\nVerree good. But suppose now, I, or any one of the Department, come to\r\nyou dressed quite different. You would not know me at all unless I\r\nchoose, I bet you. Some day I will prove it. I come as Ladakhi\r\ntrader\xe2\x80\x94oh, anything\xe2\x80\x94and I say to you: \xe2\x80\x98You want to buy precious\r\nstones?\xe2\x80\x99 You say: \xe2\x80\x98Do I look like a man who buys precious stones?\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nI say: \xe2\x80\x98Even verree poor man can buy a turquoise or _tarkeean_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is _kichree_\xe2\x80\x94vegetable curry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is. You say: \xe2\x80\x98Let me see the _tarkeean_.\xe2\x80\x99 Then I say: \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nwas cooked by a woman, and perhaps it is bad for your caste.\xe2\x80\x99 Then you\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98There is no caste when men go to\xe2\x80\x94look for _tarkeean_.\xe2\x80\x99 You stop a\r\nlittle between those words, \xe2\x80\x98to\xe2\x80\x94look\xe2\x80\x99. That is thee whole secret. The\r\nlittle stop before the words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim repeated the test-sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all right. Then I will show you my turquoise if there is time,\r\nand then you know who I am, and then we exchange views and documents\r\nand those-all things. And so it is with any other man of us. We talk\r\nsometimes about turquoises and sometimes about _tarkeean_, but always\r\nwith that little stop in the words. It is verree easy. First, \xe2\x80\x98Son of\r\nthe Charm\xe2\x80\x99, if you are in a tight place. Perhaps that may help\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not. Then what I have told you about the _tarkeean_, if you\r\nwant to transact offeecial business with a strange man. Of course, at\r\npresent, you have no offeecial business. You are\xe2\x80\x94ah ha!\xe2\x80\x94supernumerary\r\non probation. Quite unique specimen. If you were Asiatic of birth you\r\nmight be employed right off; but this half-year of leave is to make you\r\nde-Englishized, you see? The lama he expects you, because I have\r\ndemi-offeecially informed him you have passed all your examinations,\r\nand will soon obtain Government appointment. Oh ho! You are on\r\nacting-allowance, you see: so if you are called upon to help Sons of\r\nthe Charm mind you jolly-well try. Now I shall say good-bye, my dear\r\nfellow, and I hope you\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94will come out top-side all raight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHurree Babu stepped back a pace or two into the crowd at the entrance\r\nof Lucknow station and\xe2\x80\x94was gone. Kim drew a deep breath and hugged\r\nhimself all over. The nickel-plated revolver he could feel in the bosom\r\nof his sad-coloured robe, the amulet was on his neck; begging-gourd,\r\nrosary, and ghost-dagger (Mr Lurgan had forgotten nothing) were all to\r\nhand, with medicine, paint-box, and compass, and in a worn old\r\npurse-belt embroidered with porcupine-quill patterns lay a month\xe2\x80\x99s pay.\r\nKings could be no richer. He bought sweetmeats in a leaf-cup from a\r\nHindu trader, and ate them with glad rapture till a policeman ordered\r\nhim off the steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nGive the man who is not made\r\n    To his trade\r\nSwords to fling and catch again,\r\nCoins to ring and snatch again,\r\nMen to harm and cure again,\r\nSnakes to charm and lure again\xe2\x80\x94\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be hurt by his own blade,\r\nBy his serpents disobeyed,\r\nBy his clumsiness bewrayed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBy the people mocked to scorn\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    So \xe2\x80\x99tis not with juggler born!\r\nPinch of dust or withered flower,\r\n    Chance-flung fruit or borrowed staff,\r\nServe his need and shore his power,\r\n    Bind the spell, or loose the laugh!\r\n\r\n            _But a man who, etc._, Op. 15\r\n\r\nFollowed a sudden natural reaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow am I alone\xe2\x80\x94all alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all India is no one so\r\nalone as I! If I die today, who shall bring the news\xe2\x80\x94and to whom? If I\r\nlive and God is good, there will be a price upon my head, for I am a\r\nSon of the Charm\xe2\x80\x94I, Kim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA very few white people, but many Asiatics, can throw themselves into a\r\nmazement as it were by repeating their own names over and over again to\r\nthemselves, letting the mind go free upon speculation as to what is\r\ncalled personal identity. When one grows older, the power, usually,\r\ndeparts, but while it lasts it may descend upon a man at any moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Kim\xe2\x80\x94Kim\xe2\x80\x94Kim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe squatted in a corner of the clanging waiting-room, rapt from all\r\nother thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils contracted to\r\npin-points. In a minute\xe2\x80\x94in another half-second\xe2\x80\x94he felt he would arrive\r\nat the solution of the tremendous puzzle; but here, as always happens,\r\nhis mind dropped away from those heights with a rush of a wounded bird,\r\nand passing his hand before his eyes, he shook his head.\r\n\r\nA long-haired Hindu _bairagi_ (holy man), who had just bought a ticket,\r\nhalted before him at that moment and stared intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also have lost it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is one of the Gates to the\r\nWay, but for me it has been shut many years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the talk?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, abashed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing thy soul\r\nmight be. The seizure came of a sudden. _I_ know. Who should know but\r\nI? Whither goest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward Kashi [Benares].\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no Gods there. I have proved them. I go to Prayag\r\n[Allahabad] for the fifth time\xe2\x80\x94seeking the Road to Enlightenment. Of\r\nwhat faith art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI too am a Seeker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, using one of the lama\xe2\x80\x99s pet words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he forgot his Northern dress for the moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthough Allah\r\nalone knoweth what I seek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old fellow slipped the _bairagi\xe2\x80\x99s_ crutch under his armpit and sat\r\ndown on a patch of ruddy leopard\xe2\x80\x99s skin as Kim rose at the call for the\r\nBenares train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in hope, little brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long road to the feet\r\nof the One; but thither do we all travel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim did not feel so lonely after this, and ere he had sat out twenty\r\nmiles in the crowded compartment, was cheering his neighbours with a\r\nstring of most wonderful yarns about his own and his master\xe2\x80\x99s magical\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\nBenares struck him as a peculiarly filthy city, though it was pleasant\r\nto find how his cloth was respected. At least one-third of the\r\npopulation prays eternally to some group or other of the many million\r\ndeities, and so reveres every sort of holy man. Kim was guided to the\r\nTemple of the Tirthankars, about a mile outside the city, near Sarnath,\r\nby a chance-met Punjabi farmer\xe2\x80\x94a Kamboh from Jullundur-way who had\r\nappealed in vain to every God of his homestead to cure his small son,\r\nand was trying Benares as a last resort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art from the North?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, shouldering through the press of\r\nthe narrow, stinking streets much like his own pet bull at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I know the Punjab. My mother was a pahareen, but my father came\r\nfrom Amritzar\xe2\x80\x94by Jandiala,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, oiling his ready tongue for the\r\nneeds of the Road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJandiala\xe2\x80\x94Jullundur? Oho! Then we be neighbours in some sort, as it\r\nwere.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded tenderly to the wailing child in his arms. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom dost\r\nthou serve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most holy man at the Temple of the Tirthankers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all most holy and\xe2\x80\x94most greedy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jat with bitterness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have walked the pillars and trodden the temples till my feet are\r\nflayed, and the child is no whit better. And the mother being sick too\r\n... Hush, then, little one ... We changed his name when the fever came.\r\nWe put him into girl\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. There was nothing we did not do,\r\nexcept\xe2\x80\x94I said to his mother when she bundled me off to Benares\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nshould have come with me\xe2\x80\x94I _said_ Sakhi Sarwar Sultan would serve us\r\nbest. We know His generosity, but these down-country Gods are\r\nstrangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child turned on the cushion of the huge corded arms and looked at\r\nKim through heavy eyelids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was it all worthless?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim asked, with easy interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll worthless\xe2\x80\x94all worthless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, lips cracking with\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gods have given him a good mind, at least\xe2\x80\x9d said the father\r\nproudly. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think he should have listened so cleverly. Yonder is thy\r\nTemple. Now I am a poor man\xe2\x80\x94many priests have dealt with me\xe2\x80\x94but my son\r\nis my son, and if a gift to thy master can cure him\xe2\x80\x94I am at my very\r\nwits\xe2\x80\x99 end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim considered for a while, tingling with pride. Three years ago he\r\nwould have made prompt profit on the situation and gone his way without\r\na thought; but now, the very respect the Jat paid him proved that he\r\nwas a man. Moreover, he had tasted fever once or twice already, and\r\nknew enough to recognize starvation when he saw it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall him forth and I will give him a bond on my best yoke, so that the\r\nchild is cured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim halted at the carved outer door of the temple. A white-clad Oswal\r\nbanker from Ajmir, his sins of usury new wiped out, asked him what he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am _chela_ to Teshoo Lama, an Holy One from Bhotiyal\xe2\x80\x94within there.\r\nHe bade me come. I wait. Tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not forget the child,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the importunate Jat over his shoulder,\r\nand then bellowed in Punjabi; \xe2\x80\x9cO Holy One\xe2\x80\x94O disciple of the Holy One\xe2\x80\x94O\r\nGods above all the Worlds\xe2\x80\x94behold affliction sitting at the gate!\xe2\x80\x9d That\r\ncry is so common in Benares that the passers never turned their heads.\r\n\r\nThe Oswal, at peace with mankind, carried the message into the darkness\r\nbehind him, and the easy, uncounted Eastern minutes slid by; for the\r\nlama was asleep in his cell, and no priest would wake him. When the\r\nclick of his rosary again broke the hush of the inner court where the\r\ncalm images of the Arhats stand, a novice whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cThy _chela_ is\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d and the old man strode forth, forgetting the end of that prayer.\r\n\r\nHardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat ran before\r\nhim, and, lifting up the child, cried: \xe2\x80\x9cLook upon this, Holy One; and\r\nif the Gods will, he lives\xe2\x80\x94he lives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his waist-belt and drew out a small silver coin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is now?\xe2\x80\x9d The lama\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned to Kim. It was noticeable he\r\nspoke far clearer Urdu than long ago, under ZamZammah; but father would\r\nallow no private talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no more than a fever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cThe child is not well fed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sickens at everything, and his mother is not here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be permitted, I may cure, Holy One.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Have they made thee a healer? Wait here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, and he\r\nsat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple, while Kim,\r\nlooking out of the corner of his eyes, slowly opened the little\r\nbetel-box. He had dreamed dreams at school of returning to the lama as\r\na Sahib\xe2\x80\x94of chaffing the old man before he revealed himself\xe2\x80\x94boy\xe2\x80\x99s dreams\r\nall. There was more drama in this abstracted, brow-puckered search\r\nthrough the tabloid-bottles, with a pause here and there for thought\r\nand a muttered invocation between whiles. Quinine he had in tablets,\r\nand dark brown meat-lozenges\xe2\x80\x94beef most probably, but that was not _his_\r\nbusiness. The little thing would not eat, but it sucked at a lozenge\r\ngreedily, and said it liked the salt taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake then these six.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim handed them to the man. \xe2\x80\x9cPraise the Gods,\r\nand boil three in milk; other three in water. After he has drunk the\r\nmilk give him this\xe2\x80\x9d (it was the half of a quinine pill), \xe2\x80\x9cand wrap him\r\nwarm. Give him the water of the other three, and the other half of this\r\nwhite pill when he wakes. Meantime, here is another brown medicine that\r\nhe may suck at on the way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGods, what wisdom!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Kamboh, snatching.\r\n\r\nIt was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a bout of\r\nautumn malaria\xe2\x80\x94if you except the patter that he added to impress the\r\nlama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow go! Come again in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the price\xe2\x80\x94the price,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jat, and threw back his sturdy\r\nshoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son is my son. Now that he will be whole again, how\r\nshall I go back to his mother and say I took help by the wayside and\r\ndid not even give a bowl of curds in return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are alike, these Jats,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim softly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jat stood on his\r\ndunghill and the King\xe2\x80\x99s elephants went by. \xe2\x80\x98O driver,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98what\r\nwill you sell those little donkeys for?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jat burst into a roar of laughter, stifled with apologies to the\r\nlama. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the saying of my own country the very talk of it. So are\r\nwe Jats all. I will come tomorrow with the child; and the blessing of\r\nthe Gods of the Homesteads\xe2\x80\x94who are good little Gods\xe2\x80\x94be on you both ...\r\nNow, son, we grow strong again. Do not spit it out, little Princeling!\r\nKing of my Heart, do not spit it out, and we shall be strong men,\r\nwrestlers and club-wielders, by morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved away, crooning and mumbling. The lama turned to Kim, and all\r\nthe loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo heal the sick is to acquire merit; but first one gets knowledge.\r\nThat was wisely done, O Friend of all the World.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was made wise by thee, Holy One,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, forgetting the little\r\nplay just ended; forgetting St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s; forgetting his white blood;\r\nforgetting even the Great Game as he stooped, Mohammedan-fashion, to\r\ntouch his master\xe2\x80\x99s feet in the dust of the Jain temple. \xe2\x80\x9cMy teaching I\r\nowe to thee. I have eaten thy bread three years. My time is finished. I\r\nam loosed from the schools. I come to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerein is my reward. Enter! Enter! And is all well?\xe2\x80\x9d They passed to\r\nthe inner court, where the afternoon sun sloped golden across. \xe2\x80\x9cStand\r\nthat I may see. So!\xe2\x80\x9d He peered critically. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no longer a child,\r\nbut a man, ripened in wisdom, walking as a physician. I did well\xe2\x80\x94I did\r\nwell when I gave thee up to the armed men on that black night. Dost\r\nthou remember our first day under Zam-Zammah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cDost thou remember when I leapt off the carriage the\r\nfirst day I went to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gates of Learning? Truly. And the day that we ate the cakes\r\ntogether at the back of the river by Nucklao. Aha! Many times hast thou\r\nbegged for me, but that day I begged for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood reason,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cI was then a scholar in the Gates of\r\nLearning, and attired as a Sahib. Do not forget, Holy One,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on\r\nplayfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI am still a Sahib\xe2\x80\x94by thy favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. And a Sahib in most high esteem. Come to my cell, _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that known to thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst by means of letters from the kindly priest whom\r\nwe met in the camp of armed men; but he is now gone to his own country,\r\nand I sent the money to his brother.\xe2\x80\x9d Colonel Creighton, who had\r\nsucceeded to the trusteeship when Father Victor went to England with\r\nthe Mavericks, was hardly the Chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s brother. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not well\r\nunderstand Sahibs\xe2\x80\x99 letters. They must be interpreted to me. I chose a\r\nsurer way. Many times when I returned from my Search to this Temple,\r\nwhich has always been a nest to me, there came one seeking\r\nEnlightenment\xe2\x80\x94a man from Leh\xe2\x80\x94that had been, he said, a Hindu, but\r\nwearied of all those Gods.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama pointed to the Arhats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fat man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, a twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery fat; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly given up to\r\nuseless things\xe2\x80\x94such as devils and charms and the form and fashion of\r\nour tea-drinkings in the monasteries, and by what road we initiated the\r\nnovices. A man abounding in questions; but he was a friend of thine,\r\n_chela_. He told me that thou wast on the road to much honour as a\r\nscribe. And I see thou art a physician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that am I\xe2\x80\x94a scribe, when I am a Sahib, but it is set aside when I\r\ncome as thy disciple. I have accomplished the years appointed for a\r\nSahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it were a novice?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, nodding his head. \xe2\x80\x9cArt thou freed\r\nfrom the schools? I would not have thee unripe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am all free. In due time I take service under the Government as a\r\nscribe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as a warrior. That is well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut first I come to wander with thee. Therefore I am here. Who begs\r\nfor thee, these days?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on quickly. The ice was thin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery often I beg myself; but, as thou knowest, I am seldom here,\r\nexcept when I come to look again at my disciple. From one end to\r\nanother of Hind have I travelled afoot and in the _te-rain_. A great\r\nand a wonderful land! But here, when I put in, is as though I were in\r\nmy own Bhotiyal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked round the little clean cell complacently. A low cushion gave\r\nhim a seat, on which he had disposed himself in the cross-legged\r\nattitude of the Bodhisat emerging from meditation; a black teak-wood\r\ntable, not twenty inches high, set with copper tea-cups, was before\r\nhim. In one corner stood a tiny altar, also of heavily carved teak,\r\nbearing a copper-gilt image of the seated Buddha and fronted by a lamp,\r\nan incense-holder, and a pair of copper flower-pots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit by giving\r\nme these a year since,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, following Kim\xe2\x80\x99s eye. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen one is far\r\nfrom one\xe2\x80\x99s own land such things carry remembrance; and we must\r\nreverence the Lord for that He showed the Way. See!\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to a\r\ncuriously-built mound of coloured rice crowned with a fantastic metal\r\nornament. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was Abbot in my own place\xe2\x80\x94before I came to better\r\nknowledge I made that offering daily. It is the Sacrifice of the\r\nUniverse to the Lord. Thus do we of Bhotiyal offer all the world daily\r\nto the Excellent Law. And I do it even now, though I know that the\r\nExcellent One is beyond all pinchings and pattings.\xe2\x80\x9d He snuffed from\r\nhis gourd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well done, Holy One,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim murmured, sinking at ease on the\r\ncushions, very happy and rather tired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd also,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man chuckled, \xe2\x80\x9cI write pictures of the Wheel of\r\nLife. Three days to a picture. I was busied on it\xe2\x80\x94or it may be I shut\r\nmy eyes a little\xe2\x80\x94when they brought word of thee. It is good to have\r\nthee here: I will show thee my art\xe2\x80\x94not for pride\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but because\r\nthou must learn. The Sahibs have not _all_ this world\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew from under the table a sheet of strangely scented yellow\r\nChinese paper, the brushes, and slab of Indian ink. In cleanest,\r\nseverest outline he had traced the Great Wheel with its six spokes,\r\nwhose centre is the conjoined Hog, Snake, and Dove (Ignorance, Anger,\r\nand Lust), and whose compartments are all the Heavens and Hells, and\r\nall the chances of human life. Men say that the Bodhisat Himself first\r\ndrew it with grains of rice upon dust, to teach His disciples the cause\r\nof things. Many ages have crystallized it into a most wonderful\r\nconvention crowded with hundreds of little figures whose every line\r\ncarries a meaning. Few can translate the picture-parable; there are not\r\ntwenty in all the world who can draw it surely without a copy: of those\r\nwho can both draw and expound are but three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a little learned to draw,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this is a marvel\r\nbeyond marvels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have written it for many years,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cTime was when I\r\ncould write it all between one lamp-lighting and the next. I will teach\r\nthee the art\xe2\x80\x94after due preparation; and I will show thee the meaning of\r\nthe Wheel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe take the Road, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Road and our Search. I was but waiting for thee. It was made plain\r\nto me in a hundred dreams\xe2\x80\x94notably one that came upon the night of the\r\nday that the Gates of Learning first shut that without thee I should\r\nnever find my River. Again and again, as thou knowest, I put this from\r\nme, fearing an illusion. Therefore I would not take thee with me that\r\nday at Lucknow, when we ate the cakes. I would not take thee till the\r\ntime was ripe and auspicious. From the Hills to the Sea, from the Sea\r\nto the Hills have I gone, but it was vain. Then I remembered the\r\n_J\xc3\xa2taka_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told Kim the story of the elephant with the leg-iron, as he had told\r\nit so often to the Jam priests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFurther testimony is not needed,\xe2\x80\x9d he ended serenely. \xe2\x80\x9cThou wast sent\r\nfor an aid. That aid removed, my Search came to naught. Therefore we\r\nwill go out again together, and our Search sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither go we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters, Friend of all the World? The Search, I say, is sure. If\r\nneed be, the River will break from the ground before us. I acquired\r\nmerit when I sent thee to the Gates of Learning, and gave thee the\r\njewel that is Wisdom. Thou didst return, I saw even now, a follower of\r\nSakyamuni, the Physician, whose altars are many in Bhotiyal. It is\r\nsufficient. We are together, and all things are as they were\xe2\x80\x94Friend of\r\nall the World\xe2\x80\x94Friend of the Stars\xe2\x80\x94my _chela!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they talked of matters secular; but it was noticeable that the\r\nlama never demanded any details of life at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s, nor showed the\r\nfaintest curiosity as to the manners and customs of Sahibs. His mind\r\nmoved all in the past, and he revived every step of their wonderful\r\nfirst journey together, rubbing his hands and chuckling, till it\r\npleased him to curl himself up into the sudden sleep of old age.\r\n\r\nKim watched the last dusty sunshine fade out of the court, and played\r\nwith his ghost-dagger and rosary. The clamour of Benares, oldest of all\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x99s cities awake before the Gods, day and night, beat round the\r\nwalls as the sea\xe2\x80\x99s roar round a breakwater. Now and again, a Jain\r\npriest crossed the court, with some small offering to the images, and\r\nswept the path about him lest by chance he should take the life of a\r\nliving thing. A lamp twinkled, and there followed the sound of a\r\nprayer. Kim watched the stars as they rose one after another in the\r\nstill, sticky dark, till he fell asleep at the foot of the altar. That\r\nnight he dreamed in Hindustani, with never an English word...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly One, there is the child to whom we gave the medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nabout three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, when the lama, also waking from\r\ndreams, would have fared forth on pilgrimage. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jat will be here at\r\nthe light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am well answered. In my haste I would have done a wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat\r\ndown on the cushions and returned to his rosary. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely old folk are\r\nas children,\xe2\x80\x9d he said pathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cThey desire a matter\xe2\x80\x94behold, it\r\nmust be done at once, or they fret and weep! Many times when I was upon\r\nthe Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet at the hindrance of an\r\nox-cart in the way, or a mere cloud of dust. It was not so when I was a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94a long time ago. None the less it is wrongful\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou art indeed old, Holy One.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing was done. A Cause was put out into the world, and, old or\r\nyoung, sick or sound, knowing or unknowing, who can rein in the effect\r\nof that Cause? Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin it\xe2\x80\x94or a\r\ndrunkard? _Chela_, this is a great and a terrible world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it good,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim yawned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there to eat? I have not eaten\r\nsince yesterday even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten thy need. Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and cold rice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot walk far on such stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim felt all the European\xe2\x80\x99s lust\r\nfor flesh-meat, which is not accessible in a Jain temple. Yet, instead\r\nof going out at once with the begging-bowl, he stayed his stomach on\r\nslabs of cold rice till the full dawn. It brought the farmer, voluble,\r\nstuttering with gratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the night the fever broke and the sweat came,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cFeel\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94his skin is fresh and new! He esteemed the salt lozenges, and took\r\nmilk with greed.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew the cloth from the child\xe2\x80\x99s face, and it\r\nsmiled sleepily at Kim. A little knot of Jain priests, silent but\r\nall-observant, gathered by the temple door. They knew, and Kim knew\r\nthat they knew, how the old lama had met his disciple. Being courteous\r\nfolk, they had not obtruded themselves overnight by presence, word, or\r\ngesture. Wherefore Kim repaid them as the sun rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank the Gods of the Jains, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, not knowing how those\r\nGods were named. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fever is indeed broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! See!\xe2\x80\x9d The lama beamed in the background upon his hosts of three\r\nyears. \xe2\x80\x9cWas there ever such a _chela?_ He follows our Lord the Healer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the Jains officially recognize all the Gods of the Hindu creed, as\r\nwell as the Lingam and the Snake. They wear the Brahminical thread;\r\nthey adhere to every claim of Hindu caste-law. But, because they knew\r\nand loved the lama, because he was an old man, because he sought the\r\nWay, because he was their guest, and because he collogued long of\r\nnights with the head-priest\xe2\x80\x94as free-thinking a metaphysician as ever\r\nsplit one hair into seventy\xe2\x80\x94they murmured assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim bent over the child\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x9cthis trouble may come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if thou hast the proper spell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in a little while we go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama to all the Jains. \xe2\x80\x9cWe go now together upon the\r\nSearch whereof I have often spoken. I waited till my _chela_ was ripe.\r\nBehold him! We go North. Never again shall I look upon this place of my\r\nrest, O people of good will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not a beggar.\xe2\x80\x9d The cultivator rose to his feet, clutching the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe still. Do not trouble the Holy One,\xe2\x80\x9d a priest cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cMeet us again under the big railway bridge, and\r\nfor the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab, bring food\xe2\x80\x94curry, pulse,\r\ncakes fried in fat, and sweetmeats. Specially sweetmeats. Be swift!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pallor of hunger suited Kim very well as he stood, tall and slim,\r\nin his sand-coloured, sweeping robes, one hand on his rosary and the\r\nother in the attitude of benediction, faithfully copied from the lama.\r\nAn English observer might have said that he looked rather like the\r\nyoung saint of a stained-glass window, whereas he was but a growing lad\r\nfaint with emptiness.\r\n\r\nLong and formal were the farewells, thrice ended and thrice renewed.\r\nThe Seeker\xe2\x80\x94he who had invited the lama to that haven from far-away\r\nTibet, a silver-faced, hairless ascetic\xe2\x80\x94took no part in it, but\r\nmeditated, as always, alone among the images. The others were very\r\nhuman; pressing small comforts upon the old man\xe2\x80\x94a betel-box, a fine new\r\niron pencase, a food-bag, and such-like\xe2\x80\x94warning him against the dangers\r\nof the world without, and prophesying a happy end to the Search.\r\nMeantime Kim, lonelier than ever, squatted on the steps, and swore to\r\nhimself in the language of St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is my own fault,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Mahbub, I ate Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbread, or Lurgan Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s. At St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s, three meals a day. Here I\r\nmust jolly-well look out for myself. Besides, I am not in good\r\ntraining. _How_ I could eat a plate of beef now! ... Is it finished,\r\nHoly One?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama, both hands raised, intoned a final blessing in ornate\r\nChinese. \xe2\x80\x9cI must lean on thy shoulder,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as the temple gates\r\nclosed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe grow stiff, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe weight of a six-foot man is not light to steady through miles of\r\ncrowded streets, and Kim, loaded down with bundles and packages for the\r\nway, was glad to reach the shadow of the railway bridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we eat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said resolutely, as the Kamboh, blue-robed and\r\nsmiling, hove in sight, a basket in one hand and the child in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFall to, Holy Ones!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried from fifty yards. (They were by the\r\nshoal under the first bridge-span, out of sight of hungry priests.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRice and good curry, cakes all warm and well scented with _hing_\r\n(asaf\xc5\x93tida), curds and sugar. King of my fields,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this to the small\r\nson\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clet us show these holy men that we Jats of Jullundur can pay a\r\nservice ... I had heard the Jains would eat nothing that they had not\r\ncooked, but truly\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked away politely over the broad river\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhere\r\nthere is no eye there is no caste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, turning his back and heaping a leafplatter for the\r\nlama, \xe2\x80\x9care beyond all castes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey gorged themselves on the good food in silence. Nor till he had\r\nlicked the last of the sticky sweetstuff from his little finger did Kim\r\nnote that the Kamboh too was girt for travel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf our roads lie together,\xe2\x80\x9d he said roughly, \xe2\x80\x9cI go with thee. One does\r\nnot often find a worker of miracles, and the child is still weak. But I\r\nam not altogether a reed.\xe2\x80\x9d He picked up his _lathi_\xe2\x80\x94a five-foot\r\nmale-bamboo ringed with bands of polished iron\xe2\x80\x94and flourished it in the\r\nair. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jats are called quarrel-some, but that is not true. Except\r\nwhen we are crossed, we are like our own buffaloes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cA good stick is a good reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama gazed placidly up-stream, where in long, smudged perspective\r\nthe ceaseless columns of smoke go up from the burning-ghats by the\r\nriver. Now and again, despite all municipal regulations, the fragment\r\nof a half-burned body bobbed by on the full current.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Kamboh to Kim, drawing the child into his\r\nhairy breast, \xe2\x80\x9cI might today have gone thither\xe2\x80\x94with this one. The\r\npriests tell us that Benares is holy\xe2\x80\x94which none doubt\xe2\x80\x94and desirable to\r\ndie in. But I do not know their Gods, and they ask for money; and when\r\none has done one worship a shaved-head vows it is of none effect except\r\none do another. Wash here! Wash there! Pour, drink, lave, and scatter\r\nflowers\xe2\x80\x94but always pay the priests. No, the Punjab for me, and the soil\r\nof the Jullundur-_doab_ for the best soil in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said many times\xe2\x80\x94in the Temple, I think\xe2\x80\x94that if need be, the\r\nRiver will open at our feet. We will therefore go North,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlama, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember a pleasant place, set about with fruit-trees,\r\nwhere one can walk in meditation\xe2\x80\x94and the air is cooler there. It comes\r\nfrom the Hills and the snow of the Hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know? Didst thou not\xe2\x80\x94no, that was after the Army rose out\r\nof the earth and took thee away. I abode there in meditation in a room\r\nagainst the dovecot\xe2\x80\x94except when she talked eternally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! the woman from Kulu. That is by Saharunpore.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does the spirit move thy master? Does he go afoot, for the sake of\r\npast sins?\xe2\x80\x9d the Jat demanded cautiously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a far cry to Delhi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cI will beg a _tikkut_ for the _te-rain_.\xe2\x80\x9d One does not\r\nown to the possession of money in India.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, in the name of the Gods, let us take the fire-carriage. My son\r\nis best in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms. The Government has brought on us many\r\ntaxes, but it gives us one good thing\xe2\x80\x94the _te-rain_ that joins friends\r\nand unites the anxious. A wonderful matter is the _te-rain_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all piled into it a couple of hours later, and slept through the\r\nheat of the day. The Kamboh plied Kim with ten thousand questions as to\r\nthe lama\xe2\x80\x99s walk and work in life, and received some curious answers.\r\nKim was content to be where he was, to look out upon the flat\r\nNorth-Western landscape, and to talk to the changing mob of\r\nfellow-passengers. Even today, tickets and ticket-clipping are dark\r\noppression to Indian rustics. They do not understand why, when they\r\nhave paid for a magic piece of paper, strangers should punch great\r\npieces out of the charm. So, long and furious are the debates between\r\ntravellers and Eurasian ticket-collectors. Kim assisted at two or three\r\nwith grave advice, meant to darken counsel and to show off his wisdom\r\nbefore the lama and the admiring Kamboh. But at Somna Road the Fates\r\nsent him a matter to think upon. There tumbled into the compartment, as\r\nthe train was moving off, a mean, lean little person\xe2\x80\x94a Mahratta, so far\r\nas Kim could judge by the cock of the tight turban. His face was cut,\r\nhis muslin upper-garment was badly torn, and one leg was bandaged. He\r\ntold them that a country-cart had upset and nearly slain him: he was\r\ngoing to Delhi, where his son lived. Kim watched him closely. If, as he\r\nasserted, he had been rolled over and over on the earth, there should\r\nhave been signs of gravel-rash on the skin. But all his injuries seemed\r\nclean cuts, and a mere fall from a cart could not cast a man into such\r\nextremity of terror. As, with shaking fingers, he knotted up the torn\r\ncloth about his neck he laid bare an amulet of the kind called a\r\nkeeper-up of the heart. Now, amulets are common enough, but they are\r\nnot generally strung on square-plaited copper wire, and still fewer\r\namulets bear black enamel on silver. There were none except the Kamboh\r\nand the lama in the compartment, which, luckily, was of an old type\r\nwith solid ends. Kim made as to scratch in his bosom, and thereby\r\nlifted his own amulet. The Mahratta\xe2\x80\x99s face changed altogether at the\r\nsight, and he disposed the amulet fairly on his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on to the Kamboh, \xe2\x80\x9cI was in haste, and the cart, driven\r\nby a bastard, bound its wheel in a water-cut, and besides the harm done\r\nto me there was lost a full dish of _tarkeean_. I was not a Son of the\r\nCharm [a lucky man] that day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a great loss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Kamboh, withdrawing interest. His\r\nexperience of Benares had made him suspicious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho cooked it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman.\xe2\x80\x9d The Mahratta raised his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all women can cook _tarkeean_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Kamboh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good\r\ncurry, as I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, it is a good curry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mahratta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd cheap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what about caste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there is no caste where men go to\xe2\x80\x94look for _tarkeean_,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nMahratta replied, in the prescribed cadence. \xe2\x80\x9cOf whose service art\r\nthou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the service of this Holy One.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim pointed to the happy, drowsy\r\nlama, who woke with a jerk at the well-loved word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he was sent from Heaven to aid me. He is called the Friend of all\r\nthe World. He is also called the Friend of the Stars. He walks as a\r\nphysician\xe2\x80\x94his time being ripe. Great is his wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a Son of the Charm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim under his breath, as the Kamboh made\r\nhaste to prepare a pipe lest the Mahratta should beg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is _that?_\xe2\x80\x9d the Mahratta asked, glancing sideways nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne whose child I\xe2\x80\x94we have cured, who lies under great debt to us. Sit\r\nby the window, man from Jullundur. Here is a sick one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! _I_ have no desire to mix with chance-met wastrels. _My_ ears\r\nare not long. _I_ am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d The Jat\r\nslid himself heavily into a far corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt thou anything of a healer? I am ten leagues deep in calamity,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried the Mahratta, picking up the cue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man is cut and bruised all over. I go about to cure him,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\r\nretorted. \xe2\x80\x9cNone interfered between thy babe and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rebuked,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Kamboh meekly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am thy debtor for the life\r\nof my son. Thou art a miracle-worker\xe2\x80\x94I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me the cuts.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim bent over the Mahratta\xe2\x80\x99s neck, his heart nearly\r\nchoking him; for this was the Great Game with a vengeance. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, tell\r\nthy tale swiftly, brother, while I say a charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from the South, where my work lay. One of us they slew by the\r\nroadside. Hast thou heard?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim shook his head. He, of course, knew\r\nnothing of E\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, slain down South in the habit of an Arab\r\ntrader. \xe2\x80\x9cHaving found a certain letter which I was sent to seek, I came\r\naway. I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow. So sure was I that none\r\nknew, I did not change my face. At Mhow a woman brought charge against\r\nme of theft of jewellery in that city which I had left. Then I saw the\r\ncry was out against me. I ran from Mhow by night, bribing the police,\r\nwho had been bribed to hand me over without question to my enemies in\r\nthe South. Then I lay in old Chitor city a week, a penitent in a\r\ntemple, but I could not get rid of the letter which was my charge. I\r\nburied it under the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Stone, at Chitor, in the place known to us\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim did not know, but not for worlds would he have broken the thread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Chitor, look you, I was all in Kings\xe2\x80\x99 country; for Kotah to the\r\neast is beyond the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s law, and east again lie Jaipur and Gwalior.\r\nNeither love spies, and there is no justice. I was hunted like a wet\r\njackal; but I broke through at Bandakui, where I heard there was a\r\ncharge against me of murder in the city I had left\xe2\x80\x94of the murder of a\r\nboy. They have both the corpse and the witnesses waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut cannot the Government protect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe of the Game are beyond protection. If we die, we die. Our names are\r\nblotted from the book. That is all. At Bandakui, where lives one of Us,\r\nI thought to slip the scent by changing my face, and so made me a\r\nMahratta. Then I came to Agra, and would have turned back to Chitor to\r\nrecover the letter. So sure I was I had slipped them. Therefore I did\r\nnot send a tar [telegram] to any one saying where the letter lay. I\r\nwished the credit of it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim nodded. He understood that feeling well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut at Agra, walking in the streets, a man cried a debt against me,\r\nand approaching with many witnesses, would hale me to the courts then\r\nand there. Oh, they are clever in the South! He recognized me as his\r\nagent for cotton. May he burn in Hell for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wast thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO fool! I was the man they sought for the matter of the letter! I ran\r\ninto the Fleshers\xe2\x80\x99 Ward and came out by the House of the Jew, who\r\nfeared a riot and pushed me forth. I came afoot to Somna Road\xe2\x80\x94I had\r\nonly money for my _tikkut_ to Delhi\xe2\x80\x94and there, while I lay in a ditch\r\nwith a fever, one sprang out of the bushes and beat me and cut me and\r\nsearched me from head to foot. Within earshot of the _te-rain_ it was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he not slay thee out of hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not so foolish. If I am taken in Delhi at the instance of\r\nlawyers, upon a proven charge of murder, my body is handed over to the\r\nState that desires it. I go back guarded, and then\xe2\x80\x94I die slowly for an\r\nexample to the rest of Us. The South is not my country. I run in\r\ncircles\xe2\x80\x94like a goat with one eye. I have not eaten for two days. I am\r\nmarked\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he touched the filthy bandage on his leg\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso that they will\r\nknow me at Delhi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art safe in the _te-rain_, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive a year at the Great Game and tell me that again! The wires will\r\nbe out against me at Delhi, describing every tear and rag upon me.\r\nTwenty\xe2\x80\x94a hundred, if need be\xe2\x80\x94will have seen me slay that boy. And thou\r\nart useless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim knew enough of native methods of attack not to doubt that the case\r\nwould be deadly complete\xe2\x80\x94even to the corpse. The Mahratta twitched his\r\nfingers with pain from time to time. The Kamboh in his corner glared\r\nsullenly; the lama was busy over his beads; and Kim, fumbling\r\ndoctor-fashion at the man\xe2\x80\x99s neck, thought out his plan between\r\ninvocations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou a charm to change my shape? Else I am dead. Five\xe2\x80\x94ten minutes\r\nalone, if I had not been so pressed, and I might\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he cured yet, miracle-worker?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Kamboh jealously. \xe2\x80\x9cThou\r\nhast chanted long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay. There is no cure for his hurts, as I see, except he sit for three\r\ndays in the habit of a _bairagi_.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a common penance, often\r\nimposed on a fat trader by his spiritual teacher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne priest always goes about to make another priest,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort.\r\nLike most grossly superstitious folk, the Kamboh could not keep his\r\ntongue from deriding his Church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill thy son be a priest, then? It is time he took more of my\r\nquinine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe Jats are all buffaloes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Kamboh, softening anew.\r\n\r\nKim rubbed a finger-tip of bitterness on the child\xe2\x80\x99s trusting little\r\nlips. \xe2\x80\x9cI have asked for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sternly to the father,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexcept food. Dost thou grudge me that? I go to heal another man. Have\r\nI thy leave\xe2\x80\x94Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp flew the man\xe2\x80\x99s huge paws in supplication. \xe2\x80\x9cNay\xe2\x80\x94nay. Do not mock me\r\nthus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt pleases me to cure this sick one. Thou shalt acquire merit by\r\naiding. What colour ash is there in thy pipe-bowl? White. That is\r\nauspicious. Was there raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen thy bundle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the usual collection of small oddments: bits of cloth, quack\r\nmedicines, cheap fairings, a clothful of _atta_\xe2\x80\x94greyish, rough-ground\r\nnative flour\xe2\x80\x94twists of down-country tobacco, tawdry pipe-stems, and a\r\npacket of curry-stuff, all wrapped in a quilt. Kim turned it over with\r\nthe air of a wise warlock, muttering a Mohammedan invocation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is wisdom I learned from the Sahibs,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to the lama;\r\nand here, when one thinks of his training at Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s, he spoke no more\r\nthan the truth. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great evil in this man\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, as shown\r\nby the Stars, which\xe2\x80\x94which troubles him. Shall I take it away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend of the Stars, thou hast done well in all things. Let it be at\r\nthy pleasure. Is it another healing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick! Be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped the Mahratta. \xe2\x80\x9cThe train may stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA healing against the shadow of death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, mixing the Kamboh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflour with the mingled charcoal and tobacco ash in the red-earth bowl\r\nof the pipe. E, without a word, slipped off his turban and shook down\r\nhis long black hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my food\xe2\x80\x94priest,\xe2\x80\x9d the jat growled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA buffalo in the temple! Hast thou dared to look even thus far?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nKim. \xe2\x80\x9cI must do mysteries before fools; but have a care for thine eyes.\r\nIs there a film before them already? I save the babe, and for return\r\nthou\xe2\x80\x94oh, shameless!\xe2\x80\x9d The man flinched at the direct gaze, for Kim was\r\nwholly in earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I curse thee, or shall I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He picked up the outer cloth of the\r\nbundle and threw it over the bowed head. \xe2\x80\x9cDare so much as to think a\r\nwish to see, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94even I cannot save thee. Sit! Be dumb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am blind\xe2\x80\x94dumb. Forbear to curse! Co\xe2\x80\x94come, child; we will play a game\r\nof hiding. Do not, for my sake, look from under the cloth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said E23. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is thy scheme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis comes next,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, plucking the thin body-shirt. E23\r\nhesitated, with all a North-West man\xe2\x80\x99s dislike of baring his body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is caste to a cut throat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, rending it to the waist. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmust make thee a yellow Saddhu all over. Strip\xe2\x80\x94strip swiftly, and shake\r\nthy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the ash. Now, a caste-mark on\r\nthy forehead.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew from his bosom the little Survey paint-box and a\r\ncake of crimson lake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt thou only a beginner?\xe2\x80\x9d said E23, labouring literally for the dear\r\nlife, as he slid out of his body-wrappings and stood clear in the\r\nloin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut two days entered to the Game, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim replied. \xe2\x80\x9cSmear more\r\nash on the bosom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou met\xe2\x80\x94a physician of sick pearls?\xe2\x80\x9d He switched out his long,\r\ntight-rolled turban-cloth and, with swiftest hands, rolled it over and\r\nunder about his loins into the intricate devices of a Saddhu\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncincture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah! Dost thou know his touch, then? He was my teacher for a while. We\r\nmust bar thy legs. Ash cures wounds. Smear it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was his pride once, but thou art almost better. The Gods are kind to\r\nus! Give me _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a tin box of opium pills among the rubbish of the Jat\xe2\x80\x99s bundle.\r\nE23 gulped down a half handful. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are good against hunger, fear,\r\nand chill. And they make the eyes red too,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall\r\nhave heart to play the Game. We lack only a Saddhu\xe2\x80\x99s tongs. What of the\r\nold clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim rolled them small, and stuffed them into the slack folds of his\r\ntunic. With a yellow-ochre paint cake he smeared the legs and the\r\nbreast, great streaks against the background of flour, ash, and\r\nturmeric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blood on them is enough to hang thee, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe; but no need to throw them out of the window ... It is\r\nfinished.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice thrilled with a boy\xe2\x80\x99s pure delight in the Game.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn and look, O Jat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gods protect us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hooded Kamboh, emerging like a buffalo\r\nfrom the reeds. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94whither went the Mahratta? What hast thou done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib; E23, by virtue of his business,\r\nwas no bad actor. In place of the tremulous, shrinking trader there\r\nlolled against the corner an all but naked, ash-smeared, ochre-barred,\r\ndusty-haired Saddhu, his swollen eyes\xe2\x80\x94opium takes quick effect on an\r\nempty stomach\xe2\x80\x94luminous with insolence and bestial lust, his legs\r\ncrossed under him, Kim\xe2\x80\x99s brown rosary round his neck, and a scant yard\r\nof worn, flowered chintz on his shoulders. The child buried his face in\r\nhis amazed father\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook up, Princeling! We travel with warlocks, but they will not hurt\r\nthee. Oh, do not cry ... What is the sense of curing a child one day\r\nand killing him with fright the next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child will be fortunate all his life. He has seen a great healing.\r\nWhen I was a child I made clay men and horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made them too. S\xc3\xadr Ban\xc3\xa1s, he comes in the night and makes them\r\nall alive at the back of our kitchen-midden,\xe2\x80\x9d piped the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so thou art not frightened at anything. Eh, Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was frightened because my father was frightened. I felt his arms\r\nshake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, chicken-man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, and even the abashed Jat laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\ndone a healing on this poor trader. He must forsake his gains and his\r\naccount-books, and sit by the wayside three nights to overcome the\r\nmalignity of his enemies. The Stars are against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fewer money-lenders the better, say I; but, Saddhu or no Saddhu,\r\nhe should pay for my stuff on his shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo? But that is thy child on thy shoulder\xe2\x80\x94given over to the\r\nburning-ghat not two days ago. There remains one thing more. I did this\r\ncharm in thy presence because need was great. I changed his shape and\r\nhis soul. None the less, if, by any chance, O man from Jullundur, thou\r\nrememberest what thou hast seen, either among the elders sitting under\r\nthe village tree, or in thine own house, or in company of thy priest\r\nwhen he blesses thy cattle, a murrain will come among the buffaloes,\r\nand a fire in thy thatch, and rats in the corn-bins, and the curse of\r\nour Gods upon thy fields that they may be barren before thy feet and\r\nafter thy ploughshare.\xe2\x80\x9d This was part of an old curse picked up from a\r\n_faquir_ by the Taksali Gate in the days of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s innocence. It lost\r\nnothing by repetition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCease, Holy One! In mercy, cease!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jat. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not curse the\r\nhousehold. I saw nothing! I heard nothing! I am thy cow!\xe2\x80\x9d and he made\r\nto grab at Kim\xe2\x80\x99s bare foot beating rhythmically on the carriage floor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut since thou hast been permitted to aid me in the matter of a pinch\r\nof flour and a little opium and such trifles as I have honoured by\r\nusing in my art, so will the Gods return a blessing,\xe2\x80\x9d and he gave it at\r\nlength, to the man\xe2\x80\x99s immense relief. It was one that he had learned\r\nfrom Lurgan Sahib.\r\n\r\nThe lama stared through his spectacles as he had not stared at the\r\nbusiness of disguisement. \xe2\x80\x9cFriend of the Stars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthou\r\nhast acquired great wisdom. Beware that it do not give birth to pride.\r\nNo man having the Law before his eyes speaks hastily of any matter\r\nwhich he has seen or encountered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94no, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the farmer, fearful lest the master should be\r\nminded to improve on the pupil. E23, with relaxed mouth, gave himself\r\nup to the opium that is meat, tobacco, and medicine to the spent\r\nAsiatic.\r\n\r\nSo, in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension, they slid into\r\nDelhi about lamp-lighting time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nWho hath desired the Sea\xe2\x80\x94the sight of salt-water unbounded?\r\nThe heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber\r\nwind-hounded?\r\nThe sleek-barrelled swell before storm\xe2\x80\x94grey, foamless, enormous, and\r\ngrowing?\r\nStark calm on the lap of the Line\xe2\x80\x94or the crazy-eyed hurricane blowing?\r\nHis Sea in no showing the same\xe2\x80\x94his Sea and the same \xe2\x80\x99neath all showing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n            His Sea that his being fulfils?\r\nSo and no otherwise\xe2\x80\x94so and no otherwise Hill-men desire their Hills!\r\n\r\nThe Sea and the Hills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found my heart again,\xe2\x80\x9d said E23, under cover of the platform\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntumult. \xe2\x80\x9cHunger and fear make men dazed, or I might have thought of\r\nthis escape before. I was right. They come to hunt for me. Thou hast\r\nsaved my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA group of yellow-trousered Punjab policemen, headed by a hot and\r\nperspiring young Englishman, parted the crowd about the carriages.\r\nBehind them, inconspicuous as a cat, ambled a small fat person who\r\nlooked like a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s tout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee the young Sahib reading from a paper. My description is in his\r\nhand,\xe2\x80\x9d said E23. \xe2\x80\x9cThev go carriage by carriage, like fisher-folk\r\nnetting a pool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the procession reached their compartment, E23 was counting his\r\nbeads with a steady jerk of the wrist; while Kim jeered at him for\r\nbeing so drugged as to have lost the ringed fire-tongs which are the\r\nSaddhu\xe2\x80\x99s distinguishing mark. The lama, deep in meditation, stared\r\nstraight before him; and the farmer, glancing furtively, gathered up\r\nhis belongings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing here but a parcel of holy-bolies,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman aloud,\r\nand passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness; for native police mean\r\nextortion to the native all India over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trouble now,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered E23, \xe2\x80\x9clies in sending a wire as to the\r\nplace where I hid that letter I was sent to find. I cannot go to the\r\n_tar_-office in this guise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not enough I have saved thy neck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if the work be left unfinished. Did never the healer of sick\r\npearls tell thee so? Comes another Sahib! Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a tallish, sallowish District Superintendent of Police\xe2\x80\x94belt,\r\nhelmet, polished spurs and all\xe2\x80\x94strutting and twirling his dark\r\nmoustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fools are these Police Sahibs!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim genially.\r\n\r\nE23 glanced up under his eyelids. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is well said,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered in a\r\nchanged voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI go to drink water. Keep my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe blundered out almost into the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and was bad-worded\r\nin clumsy Urdu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tum mut?_ You drunk? You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t bang about as though Delhi station\r\nbelonged to you, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nE23, not moving a muscle of his countenance, answered with a stream of\r\nthe filthiest abuse, at which Kim naturally rejoiced. It reminded him\r\nof the drummer-boys and the barrack-sweepers at Umballa in the terrible\r\ntime of his first schooling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fool,\xe2\x80\x9d the Englishman drawled. \xe2\x80\x9c_Nickle-jao!_ Go back to your\r\ncarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStep by step, withdrawing deferentially and dropping his voice, the\r\nyellow Saddhu clomb back to the carriage, cursing the D.S.P. to\r\nremotest posterity, by\xe2\x80\x94here Kim almost jumped\xe2\x80\x94by the curse of the\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s Stone, by the writing under the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Stone, and by an\r\nassortment of Gods with wholly, new names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Englishman flushed angrily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s some piece of blasted impertinence. Come out of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nE23, affecting to misunderstand, gravely produced his ticket, which the\r\nEnglishman wrenched angrily from his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _zoolum!_ What oppression!\xe2\x80\x9d growled the Jat from his corner. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nfor the sake of a jest too.\xe2\x80\x9d He had been grinning at the freedom of the\r\nSaddhu\xe2\x80\x99s tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cThy charms do not work well today, Holy One!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Saddhu followed the policeman, fawning and supplicating. The ruck\r\nof passengers, busy, with their babies and their bundles, had not\r\nnoticed the affair. Kim slipped out behind him; for it flashed through\r\nhis head that he had heard this angry, stupid Sahib discoursing loud\r\npersonalities to an old lady near Umballa three years ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well\xe2\x80\x9d, the Saddhu whispered, jammed in the calling, shouting,\r\nbewildered press\xe2\x80\x94a Persian greyhound between his feet and a cageful of\r\nyelling hawks under charge of a Rajput falconer in the small of his\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone now to send word of the letter which I hid. They\r\ntold me he was in Peshawur. I might have known that he is like the\r\ncrocodile\xe2\x80\x94always at the other ford. He has saved me from present\r\ncalamity, but I owe my life to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he also one of Us?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim ducked under a Mewar camel-driver\xe2\x80\x99s greasy\r\narmpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh matrons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot less than the greatest. We are both fortunate! I will make report\r\nto him of what thou hast done. I am safe under his protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bored through the edge of the crowd besieging the carriages, and\r\nsquatted by the bench near the telegraph-office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn, or they take thy place! Have no fear for the work, brother\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nmy life. Thou hast given me breathing-space, and Strickland Sahib has\r\npulled me to land. We may work together at the Game yet. Farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim hurried to his carriage: elated, bewildered, but a little nettled\r\nin that he had no key to the secrets about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only a beginner at the Game, that is sure. _I_ could not have\r\nleaped into safety as did the Saddhu. He knew it was darkest under the\r\nlamp. _I_ could not have thought to tell news under pretence of cursing\r\n... and how clever was the Sahib! No matter, I saved the life of one\r\n... Where is the Kamboh gone, Holy One?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, as he took his\r\nseat in the now crowded compartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fear gripped him,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama replied, with a touch of tender malice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the twinkling of an\r\neye, as a protection against evil. That shook him. Then he saw the\r\nSaddhu fall sheer into the hands of the _polis_\xe2\x80\x94all the effect of thy\r\nart. Then he gathered up his son and fled; for he said that thou didst\r\nchange a quiet trader into an impudent bandier of words with the\r\nSahibs, and he feared a like fate. Where is the Saddhu?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the _polis_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim ... \xe2\x80\x9cYet I saved the Kamboh\xe2\x80\x99s child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama snuffed blandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _chela_, see how thou art overtaken! Thou didst cure the Kamboh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchild solely to acquire merit. But thou didst put a spell on the\r\nMahratta with prideful workings\xe2\x80\x94I watched thee\xe2\x80\x94and with sidelong\r\nglances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish farmer: whence\r\ncalamity and suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim controlled himself with an effort beyond his years. Not more than\r\nany other youngster did he like to eat dirt or to be misjudged, but he\r\nsaw himself in a cleft stick. The train rolled out of Delhi into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere I have offended thee I have done\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is more, _chela_. Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world, and as a\r\nstone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst not tell\r\nhow far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis ignorance was well both for Kim\xe2\x80\x99s vanity and for the lama\xe2\x80\x99s peace\r\nof mind, when we think that there was then being handed in at Simla a\r\ncode-wire reporting the arrival of E23 at Delhi, and, more important,\r\nthe whereabouts of a letter he had been commissioned to\xe2\x80\x94abstract.\r\nIncidentally, an over-zealous policeman had arrested, on charge of\r\nmurder done in a far southern State, a horribly indignant Ajmir\r\ncotton-broker, who was explaining himself to a Mr Strickland on Delhi\r\nplatform, while E23 was paddling through byways into the locked heart\r\nof Delhi city. In two hours several telegrams had reached the angry\r\nminister of a southern State reporting that all trace of a somewhat\r\nbruised Mahratta had been lost; and by the time the leisurely train\r\nhalted at Saharunpore the last ripple of the stone Kim had helped to\r\nheave was lapping against the steps of a mosque in far-away Roum\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nit disturbed a pious man at prayers.\r\n\r\nThe lama made his in ample form near the dewy bougainvillea-trellis\r\nnear the platform, cheered by the clear sunshine and the presence of\r\nhis disciple. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will put these things behind us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, indicating\r\nthe brazen engine and the gleaming track. \xe2\x80\x9cThe jolting of the\r\n_te-rain_\xe2\x80\x94though a wonderful thing\xe2\x80\x94has turned my bones to water. We\r\nwill use clean air henceforward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to the Kulu woman\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, and stepped forth\r\ncheerily under the bundles. Early morning Saharunpore-way is clean and\r\nwell scented. He thought of the other mornings at St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s, and it\r\ntopped his already thrice-heaped contentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is this new haste born from? Wise men do not run about like\r\nchickens in the sun. We have come hundreds upon hundreds of _kos_\r\nalready, and, till now, I have scarcely been alone with thee an\r\ninstant. How canst thou receive instruction all jostled of crowds? How\r\ncan I, whelmed by a flux of talk, meditate upon the Way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer tongue grows no shorter with the years, then?\xe2\x80\x9d the disciple\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor her desire for charms. I remember once when I spoke of the Wheel\r\nof Life\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the lama fumbled in his bosom for his latest copy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe was\r\nonly curious about the devils that besiege children. She shall acquire\r\nmerit by entertaining us\xe2\x80\x94in a little while\xe2\x80\x94at an after-occasion\xe2\x80\x94softly,\r\nsoftly. Now we will wander loose-foot, waiting upon the Chain of\r\nThings. The Search is sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they travelled very easily across and among the broad bloomful\r\nfruit-gardens\xe2\x80\x94by way of Aminabad, Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and\r\nlittle Phulesa\xe2\x80\x94the line of the Siwaliks always to the north, and behind\r\nthem again the snows. After long, sweet sleep under the dry stars came\r\nthe lordly, leisurely passage through a waking village\xe2\x80\x94begging-bowl\r\nheld forth in silence, but eyes roving in defiance of the Law from\r\nsky\xe2\x80\x99s edge to sky\xe2\x80\x99s edge. Then would Kim return soft-footed through the\r\nsoft dust to his master under the shadow of a mango-tree or the thinner\r\nshade of a white Doon _siris_, to eat and drink at ease. At mid-day,\r\nafter talk and a little wayfaring, they slept; meeting the world\r\nrefreshed when the air was cooler. Night found them adventuring into\r\nnew territory\xe2\x80\x94some chosen village spied three hours before across the\r\nfat land, and much discussed upon the road.\r\n\r\nThere they told their tale\xe2\x80\x94a new one each evening so far as Kim was\r\nconcerned\xe2\x80\x94and there were they made welcome, either by priest or\r\nheadman, after the custom of the kindly East.\r\n\r\nWhen the shadows shortened and the lama leaned more heavily upon Kim,\r\nthere was always the Wheel of Life to draw forth, to hold flat under\r\nwiped stones, and with a long straw to expound cycle by cycle. Here sat\r\nthe Gods on high\xe2\x80\x94and they were dreams of dreams. Here was our Heaven\r\nand the world of the demi-Gods\xe2\x80\x94horsemen fighting among the hills. Here\r\nwere the agonies done upon the beasts, souls ascending or descending\r\nthe ladder and therefore not to be interfered with. Here were the\r\nHells, hot and cold, and the abodes of tormented ghosts. Let the\r\n_chela_ study the troubles that come from over-eating\xe2\x80\x94bloated stomach\r\nand burning bowels. Obediently, then, with bowed head and brown finger\r\nalert to follow the pointer, did the _chela_ study; but when they came\r\nto the Human World, busy and profitless, that is just above the Hells,\r\nhis mind was distracted; for by the roadside trundled the very Wheel\r\nitself, eating, drinking, trading, marrying, and quarrelling\xe2\x80\x94all warmly\r\nalive. Often the lama made the living pictures the matter of his text,\r\nbidding Kim\xe2\x80\x94too ready\xe2\x80\x94note how the flesh takes a thousand shapes,\r\ndesirable or detestable as men reckon, but in truth of no account\r\neither way; and how the stupid spirit, bond-slave to the Hog, the Dove,\r\nand the Serpent\xe2\x80\x94lusting after betel-nut, a new yoke of oxen, women, or\r\nthe favour of kings\xe2\x80\x94is bound to follow the body through all the Heavens\r\nand all the Hells, and strictly round again. Sometimes a woman or a\r\npoor man, watching the ritual\xe2\x80\x94it was nothing less\xe2\x80\x94when the great yellow\r\nchart was unfolded, would throw a few flowers or a handful of cowries\r\nupon its edge. It sufficed these humble ones that they had met a Holy\r\nOne who might be moved to remember them in his prayers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCure them if they are sick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, when Kim\xe2\x80\x99s sporting\r\ninstincts woke. \xe2\x80\x9cCure them if they have fever, but by no means work\r\ncharms. Remember what befell the Mahratta.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all Doing is evil?\xe2\x80\x9d Kim replied, lying out under a big tree at\r\nthe fork of the Doon road, watching the little ants run over his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo abstain from action is well\xe2\x80\x94except to acquire merit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action\r\nwas unbefitting a Sahib. And I am a Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend of all the World,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the lama looked directly at Kim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am an old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94pleased with shows as are children. To those who follow the Way\r\nthere is neither black nor white, Hind nor Bhotiyal. We be all souls\r\nseeking escape. No matter what thy wisdom learned among Sahibs, when we\r\ncome to my River thou wilt be freed from all illusion\xe2\x80\x94at my side. Hai!\r\nMy bones ache for that River, as they ached in the _te-rain;_ but my\r\nspirit sits above my bones, waiting. The Search is sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am answered. Is it permitted to ask a question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama inclined his stately head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ate thy bread for three years\xe2\x80\x94as thou knowest. Holy One, whence\r\ncame\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is much wealth, as men count it, in Bhotiyal,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama returned\r\nwith composure. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my own place I have the illusion of honour. I ask\r\nfor that I need. I am not concerned with the account. That is for my\r\nmonastery. Ai! The black high seats in the monastery, and novices all\r\nin order!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he told stories, tracing with a finger in the dust, of the immense\r\nand sumptuous ritual of avalanche-guarded cathedrals; of processions\r\nand devil-dances; of the changing of monks and nuns into swine; of holy\r\ncities fifteen thousand feet in the air; of intrigue between monastery\r\nand monastery; of voices among the hills, and of that mysterious mirage\r\nthat dances on dry snow. He spoke even of Lhassa and of the Dalai Lama,\r\nwhom he had seen and adored.\r\n\r\nEach long, perfect day rose behind Kim for a barrier to cut him off\r\nfrom his race and his mother-tongue. He slipped back to thinking and\r\ndreaming in the vernacular, and mechanically followed the lama\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nceremonial observances at eating, drinking, and the like. The old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind turned more and more to his monastery as his eyes turned to the\r\nsteadfast snows. His River troubled him nothing. Now and again, indeed,\r\nhe would gaze long and long at a tuft or a twig, expecting, he said,\r\nthe earth to cleave and deliver its blessing; but he was content to be\r\nwith his disciple, at ease in the temperate wind that comes down from\r\nthe Doon. This was not Ceylon, nor Buddh Gaya, nor Bombay, nor some\r\ngrass-tangled ruins that he seemed to have stumbled upon two years ago.\r\nHe spoke of those places as a scholar removed from vanity, as a Seeker\r\nwalking in humility, as an old man, wise and temperate, illumining\r\nknowledge with brilliant insight. Bit by bit, disconnectedly, each tale\r\ncalled up by some wayside thing, he spoke of all his wanderings up and\r\ndown Hind; till Kim, who had loved him without reason, now loved him\r\nfor fifty good reasons. So they enjoyed themselves in high felicity,\r\nabstaining, as the Rule demands, from evil words, covetous desires; not\r\nover-eating, not lying on high beds, nor wearing rich clothes. Their\r\nstomachs told them the time, and the people brought them their food, as\r\nthe saying is. They were lords of the villages of Aminabad, Sahaigunge,\r\nAkrola of the Ford, and little Phulesa, where Kim gave the soulless\r\nwoman a blessing.\r\n\r\nBut news travels fast in India, and too soon shuffled across the\r\ncrop-land, bearing a basket of fruits with a box of Kabul grapes and\r\ngilt oranges, a white-whiskered servitor\xe2\x80\x94a lean, dry Oorya\xe2\x80\x94begging them\r\nto bring the honour of their presence to his mistress, distressed in\r\nher mind that the lama had neglected her so long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow do I remember\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the lama spoke as though it were a wholly new\r\nproposition. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is virtuous, but an inordinate talker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim was sitting on the edge of a cow\xe2\x80\x99s manger, telling stories to a\r\nvillage smith\xe2\x80\x99s children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will only ask for another son for her daughter. I have not\r\nforgotten her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet her acquire merit. Send word that we will\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey covered eleven miles through the fields in two days, and were\r\noverwhelmed with attentions at the end; for the old lady held a fine\r\ntradition of hospitality, to which she forced her son-in-law, who was\r\nunder the thumb of his women-folk and bought peace by borrowing of the\r\nmoney-lender. Age had not weakened her tongue or her memory, and from a\r\ndiscreetly barred upper window, in the hearing of not less than a dozen\r\nservants, she paid Kim compliments that would have flung European\r\naudiences into unclean dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou art still the shameless beggar-brat of the _parao_,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nshrilled. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not forgotten thee. Wash ye and eat. The father of my\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s son is gone away awhile. So we poor women are dumb and\r\nuseless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor proof, she harangued the entire household unsparingly till food and\r\ndrink were brought; and in the evening\xe2\x80\x94the smoke-scented evening,\r\ncopper-dun and turquoise across the fields\xe2\x80\x94it pleased her to order her\r\npalanquin to be set down in the untidy forecourt by smoky torchlight;\r\nand there, behind not too closely drawn curtains, she gossiped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad the Holy One come alone, I should have received him otherwise; but\r\nwith this rogue, who can be too careful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaharanee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, choosing as always the amplest title, \xe2\x80\x9cis it my\r\nfault that none other than a Sahib\xe2\x80\x94a _polis_-sahib\xe2\x80\x94called the Maharanee\r\nwhose face he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChutt! That was on the pilgrimage. When we travel\xe2\x80\x94thou\r\nknowest the proverb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalled the Maharanee a Breaker of Hearts and a Dispenser of Delights?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo remember that! It was true. So he did. That was in the time of the\r\nbloom of my beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d She chuckled like a contented parrot above the\r\nsugar lump. \xe2\x80\x9cNow tell me of thy goings and comings\xe2\x80\x94as much as may be\r\nwithout shame. How many maids, and whose wives, hang upon thine\r\neyelashes? Ye hail from Benares? I would have gone there again this\r\nyear, but my daughter\xe2\x80\x94we have only two sons. Phaii! Such is the effect\r\nof these low plains. Now in Kulu men are elephants. But I would ask thy\r\nHoly One\xe2\x80\x94stand aside, rogue\xe2\x80\x94a charm against most lamentable windy\r\ncolics that in mango-time overtake my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s eldest. Two years back\r\nhe gave me a powerful spell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Holy One!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, bubbling with mirth at the lama\xe2\x80\x99s rueful\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. I gave her one against wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeeth\xe2\x80\x94teeth\xe2\x80\x94teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Cure them if they are sick,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Kim quoted relishingly, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cbut by no\r\nmeans work charms. Remember what befell the Mahratta.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was two Rains ago; she wearied me with her continual\r\nimportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama groaned as the Unjust Judge had groaned before\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cThus it comes\xe2\x80\x94take note, my _chela_\xe2\x80\x94that even those who would\r\nfollow the Way are thrust aside by idle women. Three days through, when\r\nthe child was sick, she talked to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArre! and to whom else should I talk? The boy\xe2\x80\x99s mother knew nothing,\r\nand the father\xe2\x80\x94in the nights of the cold weather it was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Pray to the\r\nGods,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, forsooth, and turning over, snored!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave her the charm. What is an old man to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To abstain from action is well\xe2\x80\x94except to acquire merit.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh _chela_, if thou desertest me, I am all alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe found his milk-teeth easily at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nall priests are alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim coughed severely. Being young, he did not approve of her flippancy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo importune the wise out of season is to invite calamity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a talking _mynah_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the thrust came back with the\r\nwell-remembered snap of the jewelled fore-finger\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cover the stables\r\nwhich has picked up the very tone of the family priest. Maybe I forget\r\nhonour to my guests, but if ye had seen _him_ double his fists into his\r\nbelly, which was like a half-grown gourd, and cry: \xe2\x80\x98Here is the pain!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nye would forgive. I am half minded to take the _hakim\xe2\x80\x99s_ medicine. He\r\nsells it cheap, and certainly it makes him fat as Shiv\xe2\x80\x99s own bull. _He_\r\ndoes not deny remedies, but I doubted for the child because of the\r\nin-auspicious colour of the bottles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama, under cover of the monologue, had faded out into the darkness\r\ntowards the room prepared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast angered him, belike,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he. He is wearied, and I forgot, being a grandmother. (None but a\r\ngrandmother should ever oversee a child. Mothers are only fit for\r\nbearing.) Tomorrow, when he sees how my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s son is grown, he\r\nwill write the charm. Then, too, he can judge of the new _hakim\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\ndrugs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the _hakim_, Maharanee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wanderer, as thou art, but a most sober Bengali from Dacca\xe2\x80\x94a master\r\nof medicine. He relieved me of an oppression after meat by means of a\r\nsmall pill that wrought like a devil unchained. He travels about now,\r\nvending preparations of great value. He has even papers, printed in\r\nAngrezi, telling what things he has done for weak-backed men and slack\r\nwomen. He has been here four days; but hearing ye were coming (_hakims_\r\nand priests are snake and tiger the world over) he has, as I take it,\r\ngone to cover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she drew breath after this volley, the ancient servant, sitting\r\nunrebuked on the edge of the torchlight, muttered: \xe2\x80\x9cThis house is a\r\ncattle-pound, as it were, for all charlatans and\xe2\x80\x94priests. Let the boy\r\nstop eating mangoes ... but who can argue with a grandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nraised his voice respectfully: \xe2\x80\x9cSahiba, the _hakim_ sleeps after his\r\nmeat. He is in the quarters behind the dovecote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim bristled like an expectant terrier. To outface and down-talk a\r\nCalcutta-taught Bengali, a voluble Dacca drug-vendor, would be a good\r\ngame. It was not seemly that the lama, and incidentally himself, should\r\nbe thrown aside for such an one. He knew those curious bastard English\r\nadvertisements at the backs of native newspapers. St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s boys\r\nsometimes brought them in by stealth to snigger over among their mates;\r\nfor the language of the grateful patient recounting his symptoms is\r\nmost simple and revealing. The Oorya, not unanxious to play off one\r\nparasite against the other, slunk away towards the dovecote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, with measured scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir stock-in-trade is a little\r\ncoloured water and a very great shamelessness. Their prey are\r\nbroken-down kings and overfed Bengalis. Their profit is in children\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nare not born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not be envious. Charms are better, eh? _I_\r\nnever gainsaid it. See that thy Holy One writes me a good amulet by the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone but the ignorant deny\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a thick, heavy voice boomed through the\r\ndarkness, as a figure came to rest squatting\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNone but the ignorant\r\ndeny the value of charms. None but the ignorant deny the value of\r\nmedicines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rat found a piece of turmeric. Said he: \xe2\x80\x98I will open a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Kim retorted.\r\n\r\nBattle was fairly joined now, and they heard the old lady stiffen to\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest\xe2\x80\x99s son knows the names of his nurse and three Gods. Says he:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear me, or I will curse you by the three million Great Ones.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDecidedly this invisible had an arrow or two in his quiver. He went on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am but a teacher of the alphabet. I have learned all the wisdom of\r\nthe Sahibs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahibs never grow old. They dance and they play like children when\r\nthey are grandfathers. A strong-backed breed,\xe2\x80\x9d piped the voice inside\r\nthe palanquin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, too, our drugs which loosen humours of the head in hot and\r\nangry men. _Sin\xc3\xa1_ well compounded when the moon stands in the proper\r\nHouse; yellow earths I have\xe2\x80\x94_arplan_ from China that makes a man renew\r\nhis youth and astonish his household; saffron from Kashmir, and the\r\nbest salep of Kabul. Many people have died before\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I surely believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey knew the value of my drugs. I do not give _my_ sick the mere ink\r\nin which a charm is written, but hot and rending drugs which descend\r\nand wrestle with the evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery mightily they do so,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the old lady.\r\n\r\nThe voice launched into an immense tale of misfortune and bankruptcy,\r\nstudded with plentiful petitions to the Government. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for my fate,\r\nwhich overrules all, I had been now in Government employ. I bear a\r\ndegree from the great school at Calcutta\xe2\x80\x94whither, maybe, the son of\r\nthis House shall go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall indeed. If our neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s brat can in a few years be made an\r\nF A\xe2\x80\x9d (First Arts\xe2\x80\x94she used the English word, of which she had heard so\r\noften), \xe2\x80\x9chow much more shall children clever as some that I know bear\r\naway prizes at rich Calcutta.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice, \xe2\x80\x9chave I seen such a child! Born in an\r\nauspicious hour, and\xe2\x80\x94but for that colic which, alas! turning into black\r\ncholers, may carry him off like a pigeon\xe2\x80\x94destined to many years, he is\r\nenviable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hai mai!_\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cTo praise children is inauspicious, or\r\nI could listen to this talk. But the back of the house is unguarded,\r\nand even in this soft air men think themselves to be men, and women we\r\nknow ... The child\xe2\x80\x99s father is away too, and I must be _chowkedar_\r\n(watchman) in my old age. Up! Up! Take up the palanquin. Let the\r\n_hakim_ and the young priest settle between them whether charms or\r\nmedicine most avail. Ho! worthless people, fetch tobacco for the\r\nguests, and\xe2\x80\x94round the homestead go I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe palanquin reeled off, followed by straggling torches and a horde of\r\ndogs. Twenty villages knew the Sahiba\xe2\x80\x94her failings, her tongue, and her\r\nlarge charity. Twenty villages cheated her after immemorial custom, but\r\nno man would have stolen or robbed within her jurisdiction for any gift\r\nunder heaven. None the less, she made great parade of her formal\r\ninspections, the riot of which could be heard half-way to Mussoorie.\r\n\r\nKim relaxed, as one augur must when he meets another. The _hakim_,\r\nstill squatting, slid over his hookah with a friendly foot, and Kim\r\npulled at the good weed. The hangers-on expected grave professional\r\ndebate, and perhaps a little free doctoring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo discuss medicine before the ignorant is of one piece with teaching\r\nthe peacock to sing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the _hakim_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue courtesy,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim echoed, \xe2\x80\x9cis very often inattention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese, be it understood, were company-manners, designed to impress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! I have an ulcer on my leg,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a scullion. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet hence! Remove!\xe2\x80\x9d said the _hakim_. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it the habit of the place to\r\npester honoured guests? Ye crowd in like buffaloes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Sahiba knew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Kim began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAi! Ai! Come away. They are meat for our mistress. When her young\r\nShaitan\xe2\x80\x99s colics are cured perhaps we poor people may be suffered to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mistress fed thy wife when thou wast in jail for breaking the\r\nmoney-lender\xe2\x80\x99s head. Who speaks against her?\xe2\x80\x9d The old servitor curled\r\nhis white moustaches savagely in the young moonlight. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ am\r\nresponsible for the honour of this house. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d and he drove the\r\nunderlings before him.\r\n\r\nSaid the _hakim_, hardly more than shaping the words with his lips:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara? I am jolly glad to see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim\xe2\x80\x99s hand clenched about the pipe-stem. Anywhere on the open road,\r\nperhaps, he would not have been astonished; but here, in this quiet\r\nbackwater of life, he was not prepared for Hurree Babu. It annoyed him,\r\ntoo, that he had been hoodwinked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh ha! I told you at Lucknow\xe2\x80\x94_resurgam_\xe2\x80\x94I shall rise again and you\r\nshall not know me. How much did you bet\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe chewed leisurely upon a few cardamom seeds, but he breathed\r\nuneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why come here, Babuji?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! _Thatt_ is the question, as Shakespeare hath it. I come to\r\ncongratulate you on your extraordinary effeecient performance at Delhi.\r\nOah! I tell you we are all proud of you. It was verree neat and handy.\r\nOur mutual friend, he is old friend of mine. He has been in some\r\ndam\xe2\x80\x99-tight places. Now he will be in some more. He told me; I tell Mr\r\nLurgan; and he is pleased you graduate so nicely. All the Department is\r\npleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life, Kim thrilled to the clean pride (it can\r\nbe a deadly pitfall, none the less) of Departmental praise\xe2\x80\x94ensnaring\r\npraise from an equal of work appreciated by fellow-workers. Earth has\r\nnothing on the same plane to compare with it. But, cried the Oriental\r\nin him, Babus do not travel far to retail compliments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell thy tale, Babu,\xe2\x80\x9d he said authoritatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah, it is nothing. Onlee I was at Simla when the wire came in about\r\nwhat our mutual friend said he had hidden, and old Creighton\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlooked to see how Kim would take this piece of audacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Colonel Sahib,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy from St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s corrected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Of_ course. He found me at a loose string, and I had to go down to\r\nChitor to find that beastly letter. I do not like the South\xe2\x80\x94too much\r\nrailway travel; but I drew good travelling allowance. Ha! Ha! I meet\r\nour mutual at Delhi on the way back. He lies quiett just now, and says\r\nSaddhu-disguise suits him to the ground. Well, there I hear what you\r\nhave done so well, so quickly, upon the instantaneous spur of the\r\nmoment. I tell our mutual you take the bally bun, by Jove! It was\r\nsplendid. I come to tell you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe frogs were busy in the ditches, and the moon slid to her setting.\r\nSome happy servant had gone out to commune with the night and to beat\r\nupon a drum. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s next sentence was in the vernacular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow didst thou follow us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah. Thatt was nothing. I know from our mutual friend you go to\r\nSaharunpore. So I come on. Red Lamas are not inconspicuous persons. I\r\nbuy myself my drug-box, and I am very good doctor really. I go to\r\nAkrola of the Ford, and hear all about you, and I talk here and talk\r\nthere. All the common people know what you do. I knew when the\r\nhospitable old lady sent the _dooli_. They have great recollections of\r\nthe old lama\xe2\x80\x99s visits here. I know old ladies cannot keep their hands\r\nfrom medicines. So I am a doctor, and\xe2\x80\x94you hear my talk? _I_ think it is\r\nverree good. My word, Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, they know about you and the lama\r\nfor fifty miles\xe2\x80\x94the common people. So I come. Do you mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBabuji,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, looking up at the broad, grinning face, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a\r\nSahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hope to play the Great Game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are subordinate to me departmentally at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why talk like an ape in a tree? Men do not come after one from\r\nSimla and change their dress, for the sake of a few sweet words. I am\r\nnot a child. Talk Hindi and let us get to the yolk of the egg. Thou art\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94speaking not one word of truth in ten. Why art thou here? Give a\r\nstraight answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so verree disconcerting of the Europeans, Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara. _You_\r\nshould know a heap better at your time of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is the Game, I may\r\nhelp. How can I do anything if you _bukh_ (babble) all round the shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHurree Babu reached for the pipe, and sucked it till it gurgled again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I will speak vernacular. You sit tight, Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara ... It\r\nconcerns the pedigree of a white stallion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill? That was finished long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen everyone is dead the Great Game is finished. Not before. Listen\r\nto me till the end. There were Five Kings who prepared a sudden war\r\nthree years ago, when thou wast given the stallion\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree by Mahbub\r\nAli. Upon them, because of that news, and ere they were ready, fell our\r\nArmy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94eight thousand men with guns. I remember that night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the war was not pushed. That is the Government custom. The troops\r\nwere recalled because the Government believed the Five Kings were\r\ncowed; and it is not cheap to feed men among the high Passes. Hil\xc3\xa1s and\r\nBun\xc3\xa1r\xe2\x80\x94Rajahs with guns\xe2\x80\x94undertook for a price to guard the Passes\r\nagainst all coming from the North. They protested both fear and\r\nfriendship.\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off with a giggle into English: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I\r\ntell you this unoffeecially to elucidate political situation, Mister\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara. Offeecially, I am debarred from criticizing any action of\r\nsuperiors. Now I go on.\xe2\x80\x94This pleased the Government, anxious to avoid\r\nexpense, and a bond was made for so many rupees a month that Hil\xc3\xa1s and\r\nBun\xc3\xa1r should guard the Passes as soon as the State\xe2\x80\x99s troops were\r\nwithdrawn. At that time\xe2\x80\x94it was after we two met\xe2\x80\x94I, who had been selling\r\ntea in Leh, became a clerk of accounts in the Army. When the troops\r\nwere withdrawn, I was left behind to pay the coolies who made new roads\r\nin the Hills. This road-making was part of the bond between Bun\xc3\xa1r,\r\nHil\xc3\xa1s, and the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo? And then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, it was jolly-beastly cold up there too, after summer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Hurree Babu confidentially. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid these Bun\xc3\xa1r men would\r\ncut my throat every night for thee pay-chest. My native sepoy-guard,\r\nthey laughed at me! By Jove! I was such a fearful man. Nevar mind\r\nthatt. I go on colloquially ... I send word many times that these two\r\nKings were sold to the North; and Mahbub Ali, who was yet farther\r\nNorth, amply confirmed it. Nothing was done. Only my feet were frozen,\r\nand a toe dropped off. I sent word that the roads for which I was\r\npaying money to the diggers were being made for the feet of strangers\r\nand enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Russians. The thing was an open jest among the coolies. Then I\r\nwas called down to tell what I knew by speech of tongue. Mahbub came\r\nSouth too. See the end! Over the Passes this year after\r\nsnow-melting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he shivered afresh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccome two strangers under cover of\r\nshooting wild goats. They bear guns, but they bear also chains and\r\nlevels and compasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! The thing gets clearer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are well received by Hil\xc3\xa1s and Bun\xc3\xa1r. They make great promises;\r\nthey speak as the mouthpiece of a Kaisar with gifts. Up the valleys,\r\ndown the valleys go they, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Here is a place to build a\r\nbreastwork; here can ye pitch a fort. Here can ye hold the road against\r\nan army\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the very roads for which I paid out the rupees monthly. The\r\nGovernment knows, but does nothing. The three other Kings, who were\r\n_not_ paid for guarding the Passes, tell them by runner of the bad\r\nfaith of Bun\xc3\xa1r and Hil\xc3\xa1s. When all the evil is done, look you\xe2\x80\x94when\r\nthese two strangers with the levels and the compasses make the Five\r\nKings to believe that a great army will sweep the Passes tomorrow or\r\nthe next day\xe2\x80\x94Hill-people are all fools\xe2\x80\x94comes the order to me, Hurree\r\nBabu, \xe2\x80\x98Go North and see what those strangers do.\xe2\x80\x99 I say to Creighton\r\nSahib, \xe2\x80\x98This is not a lawsuit, that we go about to collect evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHurree returned to his English with a jerk: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98By Jove,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98why\r\nthe dooce do you not issue demi-offeecial orders to some brave man to\r\npoison them, for an example? It is, if you permit the observation, most\r\nreprehensible laxity on your part.\xe2\x80\x99 And Colonel Creighton, he laughed\r\nat me! It is all your beastly English pride. You think no one dare\r\nconspire! That is all tommy-rott.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim smoked slowly, revolving the business, so far as he understood it,\r\nin his quick mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thou goest forth to follow the strangers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. To meet them. They are coming in to Simla to send down their horns\r\nand heads to be dressed at Calcutta. They are exclusively sporting\r\ngentlemen, and they are allowed special faceelities by the Government.\r\nOf course, we always do that. It is our British pride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is to fear from them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, they are not black people. I can do all sorts of things with\r\nblack people, of course. They are Russians, and highly unscrupulous\r\npeople. I\xe2\x80\x94I do not want to consort with them without a witness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill they kill thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah, thatt is nothing. I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust,\r\nto meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know.\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94but they may beat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHurree Babu snapped his fingers with irritation. \xe2\x80\x9cOf _course_ I shall\r\naffeeliate myself to their camp in supernumerary capacity as perhaps\r\ninterpreter, or person mentally impotent and hungree, or some such\r\nthing. And then I must pick up what I can, I suppose. That is as easy\r\nfor me as playing Mister Doctor to the old lady. Onlee\xe2\x80\x94onlee\xe2\x80\x94you see,\r\nMister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, I am unfortunately Asiatic, which is serious detriment\r\nin some respects. And _all_so I am Bengali\xe2\x80\x94a fearful man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod made the Hare and the Bengali. What shame?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, quoting the\r\nproverb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was process of Evolution, _I_ think, from Primal Necessity, but the\r\nfact remains in all the _cui bono_. I am, oh, awfully fearful!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nremember once they wanted to cut off my head on the road to Lhassa.\r\n(No, I have never reached to Lhassa.) I sat down and cried, Mister\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara, anticipating Chinese tortures. I do not suppose these two\r\ngentlemen will torture me, but I like to provide for possible\r\ncontingency with European assistance in emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d He coughed and spat\r\nout the cardamoms. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is purely unoffeecial indent, to which you can\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x98No, Babu\xe2\x80\x99. If you have no pressing engagement with your old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94perhaps you might divert him; perhaps I can seduce his fancies\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshould like you to keep in Departmental touch with me till I find those\r\nsporting coves. I have great opeenion of you since I met my friend at\r\nDelhi. And also I will embody your name in my offeecial report when\r\nmatter is finally adjudicated. It will be a great feather in your cap.\r\nThat is why I come really.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! The end of the tale, I think, is true; but what of the\r\nfore-part?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the Five Kings? Oah! there is ever so much truth in it. A lots\r\nmore than you would suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hurree earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou come\xe2\x80\x94eh? I go\r\nfrom here straight into the Doon. It is verree verdant and painted\r\nmeads. I shall go to Mussoorie to good old Munsoorie Pahar, as the\r\ngentlemen and ladies say. Then by Rampur into Chini. That is the only\r\nway they can come. I do not like waiting in the cold, but we must wait\r\nfor them. I want to walk with them to Simla. You see, one Russian is a\r\nFrenchman, and I know my French pretty well. I have friends in\r\nChandernagore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He_ would certainly rejoice to see the Hills again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim\r\nmeditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cAll his speech these ten days past has been of little\r\nelse. If we go together\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah! We can be quite strangers on the road, if your lama prefers. I\r\nshall just be four or five miles ahead. There is no hurry for\r\nHurree\xe2\x80\x94that is an Europe pun, ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x94and you come after. There is\r\nplenty of time; they will plot and survey and map, of course. I shall\r\ngo tomorrow, and you the next day, if you choose. Eh? You go think on\r\nit till morning. By Jove, it is near morning now.\xe2\x80\x9d He yawned\r\nponderously, and with never a civil word lumbered off to his\r\nsleeping-place. But Kim slept little, and his thoughts ran in\r\nHindustani:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell is the Game called great! I was four days a scullion at Quetta,\r\nwaiting on the wife of the man whose book I stole. And that was part of\r\nthe Great Game! From the South\xe2\x80\x94God knows how far\xe2\x80\x94came up the Mahratta,\r\nplaying the Great Game in fear of his life. Now I shall go far and far\r\ninto the North playing the Great Game. Truly, it runs like a shuttle\r\nthroughout all Hind. And my share and my joy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he smiled to the\r\ndarkness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI owe to the lama here. Also to Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x94also to Creighton\r\nSahib, but chiefly to the Holy One. He is right\xe2\x80\x94a great and a wonderful\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94and I am Kim\xe2\x80\x94Kim\xe2\x80\x94Kim\xe2\x80\x94alone\xe2\x80\x94one person\xe2\x80\x94in the middle of it all.\r\nBut I will see these strangers with their levels and chains...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the upshot of last night\xe2\x80\x99s babble?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, after his\r\norisons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere came a strolling seller of drugs\xe2\x80\x94a hanger-on of the Sahiba\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHim I abolished by arguments and prayers, proving that our charms are\r\nworthier than his coloured waters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, my charms! Is the virtuous woman still bent upon a new one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery strictly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it must be written, or she will deafen me with her clamour.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nfumbled at his pencase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Plains,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, \xe2\x80\x9care always too many people. In the Hills,\r\nas I understand, there are fewer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the Hills, and the snows upon the Hills.\xe2\x80\x9d The lami tore off a tiny\r\nsquare of paper fit to go in an amulet. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what dost thou know of the\r\nHills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are very close.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim thrust open the door and looked at the long,\r\npeaceful line of the Himalayas flushed in morning-gold. \xe2\x80\x9cExcept in the\r\ndress of a Sahib, I have never set foot among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama snuffed the wind wistfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we go North,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Kim put the question to the waking sunrise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwould not\r\nmuch mid-day heat be avoided by walking among the lower hills at least?\r\n... Is the charm made, Holy One?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have written the names of seven silly devils\xe2\x80\x94not one of whom is\r\nworth a grain of dust in the eye. Thus do foolish women drag us from\r\nthe Way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHurree Babu came out from behind the dovecote washing his teeth with\r\nostentatious ritual. Full-fleshed, heavy-haunched, bull-necked, and\r\ndeep-voiced, he did not look like \xe2\x80\x9ca fearful man\xe2\x80\x9d. Kim signed almost\r\nimperceptibly that matters were in good train, and when the morning\r\ntoilet was over, Hurree Babu, in flowery speech, came to do honour to\r\nthe lama. They ate, of course, apart, and afterwards the old lady, more\r\nor less veiled behind a window, returned to the vital business of\r\ngreen-mango colics in the young. The lama\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of medicine was,\r\nof course, sympathetic only. He believed that the dung of a black\r\nhorse, mixed with sulphur, and carried in a snake-skin, was a sound\r\nremedy for cholera; but the symbolism interested him far more than the\r\nscience. Hurree Babu deferred to these views with enchanting\r\npoliteness, so that the lama called him a courteous physician. Hurree\r\nBabu replied that he was no more than an inexpert dabbler in the\r\nmysteries; but at least\xe2\x80\x94he thanked the Gods therefore\xe2\x80\x94he knew when he\r\nsat in the presence of a master. He himself had been taught by the\r\nSahibs, who do not consider expense, in the lordly halls of Calcutta;\r\nbut, as he was ever first to acknowledge, there lay a wisdom behind\r\nearthly wisdom\xe2\x80\x94the high and lonely lore of meditation. Kim looked on\r\nwith envy. The Hurree Babu of his knowledge\xe2\x80\x94oily, effusive, and\r\nnervous\xe2\x80\x94was gone; gone, too, was the brazen drug-vendor of overnight.\r\nThere remained\xe2\x80\x94polished, polite, attentive\xe2\x80\x94a sober, learned son of\r\nexperience and adversity, gathering wisdom from the lama\xe2\x80\x99s lips. The\r\nold lady confided to Kim that these rare levels were beyond her. She\r\nliked charms with plenty of ink that one could wash off in water,\r\nswallow, and be done with. Else what was the use of the Gods? She liked\r\nmen and women, and she spoke of them\xe2\x80\x94of kinglets she had known in the\r\npast; of her own youth and beauty; of the depredations of leopards and\r\nthe eccentricities of love Asiatic; of the incidence of taxation,\r\nrack-renting, funeral ceremonies, her son-in-law (this by allusion,\r\neasy to be followed), the care of the young, and the age\xe2\x80\x99s lack of\r\ndecency. And Kim, as interested in the life of this world as she soon\r\nto leave it, squatted with his feet under the hem of his robe, drinking\r\nall in, while the lama demolished one after another every theory of\r\nbody-curing put forward by Hurree Babu.\r\n\r\nAt noon the Babu strapped up his brass-bound drug-box, took his\r\npatent-leather shoes of ceremony in one hand, a gay blue-and-white\r\numbrella in the other, and set off northwards to the Doon, where, he\r\nsaid, he was in demand among the lesser kings of those parts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go in the cool of the evening, _chela_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\ndoctor, learned in physic and courtesy, affirms that the people among\r\nthese lower hills are devout, generous, and much in need of a teacher.\r\nIn a very short time\xe2\x80\x94so says the _hakim_\xe2\x80\x94we come to cool air and the\r\nsmell of pines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe go to the Hills? And by Kulu road? Oh, thrice happy!\xe2\x80\x9d shrilled the\r\nold lady. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that I am a little pressed with the care of the\r\nhomestead I would take palanquin ... but that would be shameless, and\r\nmy reputation would be cracked. Ho! Ho! I know the road\xe2\x80\x94every march of\r\nthe road I know. Ye will find charity throughout\xe2\x80\x94it is not denied to\r\nthe well-looking. I will give orders for provision. A servant to set\r\nyou forth upon your journey? No ... Then I will at least cook ye good\r\nfood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a woman is the Sahiba!\xe2\x80\x9d said the white-bearded Oorya, when a\r\ntumult rose by the kitchen quarters. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has never forgotten a friend:\r\nshe has never forgotten an enemy in all her years. And her\r\ncookery\xe2\x80\x94wah!\xe2\x80\x9d He rubbed his slim stomach.\r\n\r\nThere were cakes, there were sweetmeats, there was cold fowl stewed to\r\nrags with rice and prunes\xe2\x80\x94enough to burden Kim like a mule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am old and useless,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNone now love me\xe2\x80\x94and none\r\nrespect\xe2\x80\x94but there are few to compare with me when I call on the Gods\r\nand squat to my cooking-pots. Come again, O people of good will. Holy\r\nOne and disciple, come again. The room is always prepared; the welcome\r\nis always ready ... See the women do not follow thy _chela_ too openly.\r\nI know the women of Kulu. Take heed, _chela_, lest he run away when he\r\nsmells his Hills again ... Hai! Do not tilt the rice-bag upside down\r\n... Bless the household, Holy One, and forgive thy servant her\r\nstupidities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wiped her red old eyes on a corner of her veil, and clucked\r\nthroatily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama at last, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s infirmity.\r\nI gave her a charm. She is upon the Wheel and wholly given over to the\r\nshows of this life, but none the less, _chela_, she is virtuous,\r\nkindly, hospitable\xe2\x80\x94of a whole and zealous heart. Who shall say she does\r\nnot acquire merit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, Holy One,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, reslinging the bountiful provision on his\r\nshoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my mind\xe2\x80\x94behind my eyes\xe2\x80\x94I have tried to picture such an\r\none altogether freed from the Wheel\xe2\x80\x94desiring nothing, causing nothing\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nnun, as it were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, O imp?\xe2\x80\x9d The lama almost laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot make the picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I. But there are many, many millions of lives before her. She will\r\nget wisdom a little, it may be, in each one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will she forget how to make stews with saffron upon that road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy mind is set on things unworthy. But she has skill. I am refreshed\r\nall over. When we reach the lower hills I shall be yet stronger. The\r\n_hakim_ spoke truly to me this morn when he said a breath from the\r\nsnows blows away twenty years from the life of a man. We will go up\r\ninto the Hills\xe2\x80\x94the high hills\xe2\x80\x94up to the sound of snow-waters and the\r\nsound of the trees\xe2\x80\x94for a little while. The _hakim_ said that at any\r\ntime we may return to the Plains, for we do no more than skirt the\r\npleasant places. The _hakim_ is full of learning; but he is in no way\r\nproud. I spoke to him\xe2\x80\x94when thou wast talking to the Sahiba\xe2\x80\x94of a certain\r\ndizziness that lays hold upon the back of my neck in the night, and he\r\nsaid it rose from excessive heat\xe2\x80\x94to be cured by cool air. Upon\r\nconsideration, I marvelled that I had not thought of such a simple\r\nremedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst thou tell him of thy Search?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, a little jealously. He\r\npreferred to sway the lama by his own speech\xe2\x80\x94not through the wiles of\r\nHurree Babu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly. I told him of my dream, and of the manner by which I had\r\nacquired merit by causing thee to be taught wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou didst not say I was a Sahib?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat need? I have told thee many times we be but two souls seeking\r\nescape. He said\xe2\x80\x94and he is just herein\xe2\x80\x94that the River of Healing will\r\nbreak forth even as I dreamed\xe2\x80\x94at my feet, if need be. Having found the\r\nWay, seest thou, that shall free me from the Wheel, need I trouble to\r\nfind a way about the mere fields of earth\xe2\x80\x94which are illusion? That were\r\nsenseless. I have my dreams, night upon night repeated; I have\r\n_J\xc3\xa2taka;_ and I have thee, Friend of all the World. It was written in\r\nthy horoscope that a Red Bull on a green field\xe2\x80\x94I have not\r\nforgotten\xe2\x80\x94should bring thee to honour. Who but I saw that prophecy\r\naccomplished? Indeed, I was the instrument. Thou shalt find me my\r\nRiver, being in return the instrument. The Search is sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe set his ivory-yellow face, serene and untroubled, towards the\r\nbeckoning Hills; his shadow shouldering far before him in the dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWho hath desired the Sea\xe2\x80\x94the immense and contemptuous surges?\r\nThe shudder, the stumble, the swerve ere the star-stabbing bowsprit\r\nmerges\xe2\x80\x94\r\nThe orderly clouds of the Trades and the ridged roaring sapphire\r\nthereunder\xe2\x80\x94\r\nUnheralded cliff-lurking flaws and the head-sails\xe2\x80\x99 low-volleying\r\nthunder?\r\nHis Sea in no wonder the same\xe2\x80\x94his Sea and the same in each wonder\xe2\x80\x94\r\nHis Sea that his being fulfils?\r\nSo and no otherwise\xe2\x80\x94so and no otherwise hill-men desire their hills!\r\n\r\nThe Sea and the Hills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho goes to the hills goes to his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had crossed the Siwaliks and the half-tropical Doon, left\r\nMussoorie behind them, and headed north along the narrow hill-roads.\r\nDay after day they struck deeper into the huddled mountains, and day\r\nafter day Kim watched the lama return to a man\xe2\x80\x99s strength. Among the\r\nterraces of the Doon he had leaned on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, ready to\r\nprofit by wayside halts. Under the great ramp to Mussoorie he drew\r\nhimself together as an old hunter faces a well-remembered bank, and\r\nwhere he should have sunk exhausted swung his long draperies about him,\r\ndrew a deep double-lungful of the diamond air, and walked as only a\r\nhillman can. Kim, plains-bred and plains-fed, sweated and panted\r\nastonished. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is _my_ country,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cBeside Such-zen,\r\nthis is flatter than a rice-field\xe2\x80\x9d; and with steady, driving strokes\r\nfrom the loins he strode upwards. But it was on the steep downhill\r\nmarches, three thousand feet in three hours, that he went utterly away\r\nfrom Kim, whose back ached with holding back, and whose big toe was\r\nnigh cut off by his grass sandal-string. Through the speckled shadow of\r\nthe great deodar-forests; through oak feathered and plumed with ferns;\r\nbirch, ilex, rhododendron, and pine, out on to the bare hillsides\xe2\x80\x99\r\nslippery sunburnt grass, and back into the woodlands\xe2\x80\x99 coolth again,\r\ntill oak gave way to bamboo and palm of the valley, the lama swung\r\nuntiring.\r\n\r\nGlancing back in the twilight at the huge ridges behind him and the\r\nfaint, thin line of the road whereby they had come, he would lay out,\r\nwith a hillman\xe2\x80\x99s generous breadth of vision, fresh marches for the\r\nmorrow; or, halting in the neck of some uplifted pass that gave on\r\nSpiti and Kulu, would stretch out his hands yearningly towards the high\r\nsnows of the horizon. In the dawns they flared windy-red above stark\r\nblue, as Kedarnath and Badrinath\xe2\x80\x94kings of that wilderness\xe2\x80\x94took the\r\nfirst sunlight. All day long they lay like molten silver under the sun,\r\nand at evening put on their jewels again. At first they breathed\r\ntemperately upon the travellers, winds good to meet when one crawled\r\nover some gigantic hog\xe2\x80\x99s-back; but in a few days, at a height of nine\r\nor ten thousand feet, those breezes bit; and Kim kindly allowed a\r\nvillage of hillmen to acquire merit by giving him a rough blanket-coat.\r\nThe lama was mildly surprised that anyone should object to the\r\nknife-edged breezes which had cut the years off his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are but the lower hills, _chela_. There is no cold till we come\r\nto the true Hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAir and water are good, and the people are devout enough, but the food\r\nis very bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim growled; \xe2\x80\x9cand we walk as though we were mad\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nEnglish. It freezes at night, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little, maybe; but only enough to make old bones rejoice in the sun.\r\nWe must not always delight in soft beds and rich food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might at least keep to the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim had all a plainsman\xe2\x80\x99s affection for the well-trodden track, not six\r\nfeet wide, that snaked among the mountains; but the lama, being\r\nTibetan, could not refrain from short cuts over spurs and the rims of\r\ngravel-strewn slopes. As he explained to his limping disciple, a man\r\nbred among mountains can prophesy the course of a mountain-road, and\r\nthough low-lying clouds might be a hindrance to a short-cutting\r\nstranger, they made no earthly difference to a thoughtful man. Thus,\r\nafter long hours of what would be reckoned very fair mountaineering in\r\ncivilized countries, they would pant over a saddle-back, sidle past a\r\nfew landslips, and drop through forest at an angle of forty-five onto\r\nthe road again. Along their track lay the villages of the hillfolk\xe2\x80\x94mud\r\nand earth huts, timbers now and then rudely carved with an axe\xe2\x80\x94clinging\r\nlike swallows\xe2\x80\x99 nests against the steeps, huddled on tiny flats half-way\r\ndown a three-thousand-foot glissade; jammed into a corner between\r\ncliffs that funnelled and focused every wandering blast; or, for the\r\nsake of summer pasture, cowering down on a neck that in winter would be\r\nten feet deep in snow. And the people\xe2\x80\x94the sallow, greasy, duffle-clad\r\npeople, with short bare legs and faces almost Esquimaux\xe2\x80\x94would flock out\r\nand adore. The Plains\xe2\x80\x94kindly and gentle\xe2\x80\x94had treated the lama as a holy\r\nman among holy men. But the Hills worshipped him as one in the\r\nconfidence of all their devils. Theirs was an almost obliterated\r\nBuddhism, overlaid with a nature-worship fantastic as their own\r\nlandscapes, elaborate as the terracing of their tiny fields; but they\r\nrecognized the big hat, the clicking rosary, and the rare Chinese texts\r\nfor great authority; and they respected the man beneath the hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw thee come down over the black Breasts of Eua,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Betah who\r\ngave them cheese, sour milk, and stone-hard bread one evening. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do\r\nnot use that often\xe2\x80\x94except when calving cows stray in summer. There is a\r\nsudden wind among those stones that casts men down on the stillest day.\r\nBut what should such folk care for the Devil of Eua!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen did Kim, aching in every fibre, dizzy with looking down, footsore\r\nwith cramping desperate toes into inadequate crannies, take joy in the\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s march\xe2\x80\x94such joy as a boy of St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s who had won the\r\nquarter-mile on the flat might take in the praises of his friends. The\r\nhills sweated the _ghi_ and sugar suet off his bones; the dry air,\r\ntaken sobbingly at the head of cruel passes, firmed and built out his\r\nupper ribs; and the tilted levels put new hard muscles into calf and\r\nthigh.\r\n\r\nThey meditated often on the Wheel of Life\xe2\x80\x94the more so since, as the\r\nlama said, they were freed from its visible temptations. Except the\r\ngrey eagle and an occasional far-seen bear grubbing and rooting on the\r\nhillside; a vision of a furious painted leopard met at dawn in a still\r\nvalley devouring a goat; and now and again a bright-coloured bird, they\r\nwere alone with the winds and the grass singing under the wind. The\r\nwomen of the smoky huts over whose roofs the two walked as they\r\ndescended the mountains, were unlovely and unclean, wives of many\r\nhusbands, and afflicted with goitre. The men were woodcutters when they\r\nwere not farmers\xe2\x80\x94meek, and of an incredible simplicity. But that\r\nsuitable discourse might not fail, Fate sent them, overtaking and\r\novertaken upon the road, the courteous Dacca physician, who paid for\r\nhis food in ointments good for goitre and counsels that restore peace\r\nbetween men and women. He seemed to know these hills as well as he knew\r\nthe hill dialects, and gave the lama the lie of the land towards Ladakh\r\nand Tibet. He said they could return to the Plains at any moment.\r\nMeantime, for such as loved mountains, yonder road might amuse. This\r\nwas not all revealed in a breath, but at evening encounters on the\r\nstone threshing-floors, when, patients disposed of, the doctor would\r\nsmoke and the lama snuff, while Kim watched the wee cows grazing on the\r\nhousetops, or threw his soul after his eyes across the deep blue gulfs\r\nbetween range and range. And there were talks apart in the dark woods,\r\nwhen the doctor would seek herbs, and Kim, as budding physician, must\r\naccompany him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, I do not know what the deuce-an\xe2\x80\x99 all I shall\r\ndo when I find our sporting friends; but if you will kindly keep within\r\nsight of my umbrella, which is fine fixed point for cadastral survey, I\r\nshall feel much better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim looked out across the jungle of peaks. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not my country,\r\n_hakim_. Easier, I think, to find one louse in a bear-skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah, thatt is my strong points. There is no hurry for Hurree. They\r\nwere at Leh not so long ago. They said they had come down from the\r\nKarakorum with their heads and horns and all. I am onlee afraid they\r\nwill have sent back all their letters and compromising things from Leh\r\ninto Russian territoree. Of course they will walk away as far to the\r\nEast as possible\xe2\x80\x94just to show that they were never among the Western\r\nStates. You do not know the Hills?\xe2\x80\x9d He scratched with a twig on the\r\nearth. \xe2\x80\x9cLook! They should have come in by Srinagar or Abbottabad.\r\n_Thatt_ is their short road\xe2\x80\x94down the river by Bunji and Astor. But they\r\nhave made mischief in the West. So\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he drew a furrow from left to\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey march and they march away East to Leh (ah! it is cold\r\nthere), and down the Indus to Hanl\xc3\xa9 (I know that road), and then down,\r\nyou see, to Bushahr and Chini valley. That is ascertained by process of\r\nelimination, and also by asking questions from people that I cure so\r\nwell. Our friends have been a long time playing about and producing\r\nimpressions. So they are well known from far off. You will see me catch\r\nthem somewhere in Chini valley. Please keep your eye on the umbrella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt nodded like a wind-blown harebell down the valleys and round the\r\nmountain sides, and in due time the lama and Kim, who steered by\r\ncompass, would overhaul it, vending ointments and powders at eventide.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe came by such and such a way!\xe2\x80\x9d The lama would throw a careless\r\nfinger backward at the ridges, and the umbrella would expend itself in\r\ncompliments.\r\n\r\nThey crossed a snowy pass in cold moonlight, when the lama, mildly\r\nchaffing Kim, went through up to his knees, like a Bactrian camel\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsnow-bred, shag-haired sort that came into the Kashmir Serai. They\r\ndipped across beds of light snow and snow-powdered shale, where they\r\ntook refuge from a gale in a camp of Tibetans hurrying down tiny sheep,\r\neach laden with a bag of borax. They came out upon grassy shoulders\r\nstill snow-speckled, and through forest, to grass anew. For all their\r\nmarchings, Kedarnath and Badrinath were not impressed; and it was only\r\nafter days of travel that Kim, uplifted upon some insignificant\r\nten-thousand-foot hummock, could see that a shoulder-knot or horn of\r\nthe two great lords had\xe2\x80\x94ever so slightly\xe2\x80\x94changed outline.\r\n\r\nAt last they entered a world within a world\xe2\x80\x94a valley of leagues where\r\nthe high hills were fashioned of a mere rubble and refuse from off the\r\nknees of the mountains. Here one day\xe2\x80\x99s march carried them no farther,\r\nit seemed, than a dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s clogged pace bears him in a nightmare. They\r\nskirted a shoulder painfully for hours, and, behold, it was but an\r\noutlying boss in an outlying buttress of the main pile! A rounded\r\nmeadow revealed itself, when they had reached it, for a vast tableland\r\nrunning far into the valley. Three days later, it was a dim fold in the\r\nearth to southward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely the Gods live here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, beaten down by the silence and\r\nthe appalling sweep and dispersal of the cloud-shadows after rain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no place for men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong and long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, as to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cit was asked of the\r\nLord whether the world were everlasting. On this the Excellent One\r\nreturned no answer ... When I was in Ceylon, a wise Seeker confirmed\r\nthat from the gospel which is written in Pali. Certainly, since we know\r\nthe way to Freedom, the question were unprofitable, but\xe2\x80\x94look, and know\r\nillusion, _chela!_ These\xe2\x80\x94are the true Hills! They are like my hills by\r\nSuchzen. Never were such hills!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbove them, still enormously above them, earth towered away towards the\r\nsnow-line, where from east to west across hundreds of miles, ruled as\r\nwith a ruler, the last of the bold birches stopped. Above that, in\r\nscarps and blocks upheaved, the rocks strove to fight their heads above\r\nthe white smother. Above these again, changeless since the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeginning, but changing to every mood of sun and cloud, lay out the\r\neternal snow. They could see blots and blurs on its face where storm\r\nand wandering wullie-wa got up to dance. Below them, as they stood, the\r\nforest slid away in a sheet of blue-green for mile upon mile; below the\r\nforest was a village in its sprinkle of terraced fields and steep\r\ngrazing-grounds. Below the village they knew, though a thunderstorm\r\nworried and growled there for the moment, a pitch of twelve or fifteen\r\nhundred feet gave to the moist valley where the streams gather that are\r\nthe mothers of young Sutluj.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the lama had led Kim by cow-track and by-road, far from the\r\nmain route along which Hurree Babu, that \xe2\x80\x9cfearful man\xe2\x80\x9d, had bucketed\r\nthree days before through a storm to which nine Englishmen out of ten\r\nwould have given full right of way. Hurree was no game-shot\xe2\x80\x94the snick\r\nof a trigger made him change colour\xe2\x80\x94but, as he himself would have said,\r\nhe was \xe2\x80\x9cfairly effeecient stalker\xe2\x80\x9d, and he had raked the huge valley\r\nwith a pair of cheap binoculars to some purpose. Moreover, the white of\r\nworn canvas tents against green carries far. Hurree Babu had seen all\r\nhe wanted to see when he sat on the threshing-floor of Ziglaur, twenty\r\nmiles away as the eagle flies, and forty by road\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, two\r\nsmall dots which one day were just below the snow-line, and the next\r\nhad moved downward perhaps six inches on the hillside. Once cleaned out\r\nand set to the work, his fat bare legs could cover a surprising amount\r\nof ground, and this was the reason why, while Kim and the lama lay in a\r\nleaky hut at Ziglaur till the storm should be over-past, an oily, wet,\r\nbut always smiling Bengali, talking the best of English with the vilest\r\nof phrases, was ingratiating himself with two sodden and rather\r\nrheumatic foreigners. He had arrived, revolving many wild schemes, on\r\nthe heels of a thunderstorm which had split a pine over against their\r\ncamp, and so convinced a dozen or two forcibly impressed\r\nbaggage-coolies the day was inauspicious for farther travel that with\r\none accord they had thrown down their loads and jibbed. They were\r\nsubjects of a Hill Rajah who farmed out their services, as is the\r\ncustom, for his private gain; and, to add to their personal distresses,\r\nthe strange Sahibs had already threatened them with rifles. The most of\r\nthem knew rifles and Sahibs of old: they were trackers and _shikarris_\r\nof the Northern valleys, keen after bear and wild goat; but they had\r\nnever been thus treated in their lives. So the forest took them to her\r\nbosom, and, for all oaths and clamour, refused to restore. There was no\r\nneed to feign madness or\xe2\x80\x94the Babu had thought of another means of\r\nsecuring a welcome. He wrung out his wet clothes, slipped on his\r\npatent-leather shoes, opened the blue-and-white umbrella, and with\r\nmincing gait and a heart beating against his tonsils appeared as \xe2\x80\x9cagent\r\nfor His Royal Highness, the Rajah of Rampur, gentlemen. What can I do\r\nfor you, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen were delighted. One was visibly French, the other\r\nRussian, but they spoke English not much inferior to the Babu\xe2\x80\x99s. They\r\nbegged his kind offices. Their native servants had gone sick at Leh.\r\nThey had hurried on because they were anxious to bring the spoils of\r\nthe chase to Simla ere the skins grew moth-eaten. They bore a general\r\nletter of introduction (the Babu salaamed to it orientally) to all\r\nGovernment officials. No, they had not met any other shooting-parties\r\n_en route_. They did for themselves. They had plenty of supplies. They\r\nonly wished to push on as soon as might be. At this he waylaid a\r\ncowering hillman among the trees, and after three minutes\xe2\x80\x99 talk and a\r\nlittle silver (one cannot be economical upon State service, though\r\nHurree\xe2\x80\x99s heart bled at the waste) the eleven coolies and the three\r\nhangers-on reappeared. At least the Babu would be a witness to their\r\noppression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy royal master, he will be much annoyed, but these people are onlee\r\ncommon people and grossly ignorant. If your honours will kindly\r\noverlook unfortunate affair, I shall be much pleased. In a little while\r\nrain will stop and we can then proceed. You have been shooting, eh?\r\nThat is fine performance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe skipped nimbly from one _kilta_ to the next, making pretence to\r\nadjust each conical basket. The Englishman is not, as a rule, familiar\r\nwith the Asiatic, but he would not strike across the wrist a kindly\r\nBabu who had accidentally upset a _kilta_ with a red oilskin top. On\r\nthe other hand, he would not press drink upon a Babu were he never so\r\nfriendly, nor would he invite him to meat. The strangers did all these\r\nthings, and asked many questions\xe2\x80\x94about women mostly\xe2\x80\x94to which Hurree\r\nreturned gay and unstudied answers. They gave him a glass of whitish\r\nfluid like to gin, and then more; and in a little time his gravity\r\ndeparted from him. He became thickly treasonous, and spoke in terms of\r\nsweeping indecency of a Government which had forced upon him a white\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s education and neglected to supply him with a white man\xe2\x80\x99s salary.\r\nHe babbled tales of oppression and wrong till the tears ran down his\r\ncheeks for the miseries of his land. Then he staggered off, singing\r\nlove-songs of Lower Bengal, and collapsed upon a wet tree-trunk. Never\r\nwas so unfortunate a product of English rule in India more unhappily\r\nthrust upon aliens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all just of that pattern,\xe2\x80\x9d said one sportsman to the other in\r\nFrench. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we get into India proper thou wilt see. I should like to\r\nvisit his Rajah. One might speak the good word there. It is possible\r\nthat he has heard of us and wishes to signify his good-will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not time. We must get into Simla as soon as may be,\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\ncompanion replied. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my own part, I wish our reports had been sent\r\nback from Hil\xc3\xa1s, or even Leh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe English post is better and safer. Remember we are given all\r\nfacilities\xe2\x80\x94and Name of God!\xe2\x80\x94they give them to us too! Is it\r\nunbelievable stupidity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is pride\xe2\x80\x94pride that deserves and will receive punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! To fight a fellow-Continental in our game is something. There is\r\na risk attached, but these people\xe2\x80\x94bah! It is too easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPride\xe2\x80\x94all pride, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what the deuce is good of Chandernagore being so close to Calcutta\r\nand all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hurree, snoring open-mouthed on the sodden moss, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\ncannot understand their French? They talk so par_tic_ularly fast! It\r\nwould have been much better to cut their beastly throats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he presented himself again he was racked with a headache\xe2\x80\x94penitent,\r\nand volubly afraid that in his drunkenness he might have been\r\nindiscreet. He loved the British Government\xe2\x80\x94it was the source of all\r\nprosperity and honour, and his master at Rampur held the very same\r\nopinion. Upon this the men began to deride him and to quote past words,\r\ntill step by step, with deprecating smirks, oily grins, and leers of\r\ninfinite cunning, the poor Babu was beaten out of his defences and\r\nforced to speak\xe2\x80\x94truth. When Lurgan was told the tale later, he mourned\r\naloud that he could not have been in the place of the stubborn,\r\ninattentive coolies, who with grass mats over their heads and the\r\nraindrops puddling in their footprints, waited on the weather. All the\r\nSahibs of their acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94rough-clad men joyously returning year\r\nafter year to their chosen gullies\xe2\x80\x94had servants and cooks and\r\norderlies, very often hillmen. These Sahibs travelled without any\r\nretinue. Therefore they were poor Sahibs, and ignorant; for no Sahib in\r\nhis senses would follow a Bengali\xe2\x80\x99s advice. But the Bengali, appearing\r\nfrom somewhere, had given them money, and could make shift with their\r\ndialect. Used to comprehensive ill-treatment from their own colour,\r\nthey suspected a trap somewhere, and stood by to run if occasion\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nThen through the new-washed air, steaming with delicious earth-smells,\r\nthe Babu led the way down the slopes\xe2\x80\x94walking ahead of the coolies in\r\npride; walking behind the foreigners in humility. His thoughts were\r\nmany and various. The least of them would have interested his\r\ncompanions beyond words. But he was an agreeable guide, ever keen to\r\npoint out the beauties of his royal master\xe2\x80\x99s domain. He peopled the\r\nhills with anything thev had a mind to slay\xe2\x80\x94thar, ibex, or markhor, and\r\nbear by Elisha\xe2\x80\x99s allowance. He discoursed of botany and ethnology with\r\nunimpeachable inaccuracy, and his store of local legends\xe2\x80\x94he had been a\r\ntrusted agent of the State for fifteen years, remember\xe2\x80\x94was\r\ninexhaustible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly this fellow is an original,\xe2\x80\x9d said the taller of the two\r\nforeigners. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is like the nightmare of a Viennese courier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe represents _in petto_ India in transition\xe2\x80\x94the monstrous hybridism\r\nof East and West,\xe2\x80\x9d the Russian replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is _we_ who can deal with\r\nOrientals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has lost his own country and has not acquired any other. But he has\r\na most complete hatred of his conquerors. Listen. He confided to me\r\nlast night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\nUnder the striped umbrella Hurree Babu was straining ear and brain to\r\nfollow the quick-poured French, and keeping both eyes on a _kilta_ full\r\nof maps and documents\xe2\x80\x94an extra-large one with a double red oil-skin\r\ncover. He did not wish to steal anything. He only desired to know what\r\nto steal, and, incidentally, how to get away when he had stolen it. He\r\nthanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there\r\nremained some valuables to steal.\r\n\r\nOn the second day the road rose steeply to a grass spur above the\r\nforest; and it was here, about sunset, that they came across an aged\r\nlama\xe2\x80\x94but they called him a bonze\xe2\x80\x94sitting cross-legged above a\r\nmysterious chart held down by stones, which he was explaining to a\r\nyoung man, evidently a neophyte, of singular, though unwashen, beauty.\r\nThe striped umbrella had been sighted half a march away, and Kim had\r\nsuggested a halt till it came up to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hurree Babu, resourceful as Puss-in-Boots. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is eminent\r\nlocal holy man. Probably subject of my royal master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing? It is very curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is expounding holy picture\xe2\x80\x94_all_ hand-worked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men stood bareheaded in the wash of the afternoon sunlight low\r\nacross the gold-coloured grass. The sullen coolies, glad of the check,\r\nhalted and slid down their loads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frenchman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is like a picture for the birth of a\r\nreligion\xe2\x80\x94the first teacher and the first disciple. Is he a Buddhist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf some debased kind,\xe2\x80\x9d the other answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no true\r\nBuddhists among the Hills. But look at the folds of the drapery. Look\r\nat his eyes\xe2\x80\x94how insolent! Why does this make one feel that we are so\r\nyoung a people?\xe2\x80\x9d The speaker struck passionately at a tall weed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhave nowhere left our mark yet. Nowhere! _That_, do you understand, is\r\nwhat disquiets me.\xe2\x80\x9d He scowled at the placid face, and the monumental\r\ncalm of the pose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave patience. We shall make your mark together\xe2\x80\x94we and you young\r\npeople. Meantime, draw his picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Babu advanced loftily; his back out of all keeping with his\r\ndeferential speech, or his wink towards Kim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly One, these be Sahibs. My medicines cured one of a flux, and I go\r\ninto Simla to oversee his recovery. They wish to see thy picture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo heal the sick is always good. This is the Wheel of Life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlama, \xe2\x80\x9cthe same I showed thee in the hut at Ziglaur when the rain\r\nfell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to hear thee expound it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama\xe2\x80\x99s eyes lighted at the prospect of new listeners. \xe2\x80\x9cTo expound\r\nthe Most Excellent Way is good. Have they any knowledge of Hindi, such\r\nas had the Keeper of Images?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHereat, simply as a child engrossed with a new game, the lama threw\r\nback his head and began the full-throated invocation of the Doctor of\r\nDivinity ere he opens the full doctrine. The strangers leaned on their\r\nalpenstocks and listened. Kim, squatting humbly, watched the red\r\nsunlight on their faces, and the blend and parting of their long\r\nshadows. They wore un-English leggings and curious girt-in belts that\r\nreminded him hazily of the pictures in a book in St Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s library\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_The Adventures of a Young Naturalist in Mexico_\xe2\x80\x99 was its name. Yes,\r\nthey looked very like the wonderful M. Sumichrast of that tale, and\r\nvery unlike the \xe2\x80\x9chighly unscrupulous folk\xe2\x80\x9d of Hurree Babu\xe2\x80\x99s imagining.\r\nThe coolies, earth-coloured and mute, crouched reverently some twenty\r\nor thirty yards away, and the Babu, the slack of his thin gear snapping\r\nlike a marking-flag in the chill breeze, stood by with an air of happy\r\nproprietorship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the men,\xe2\x80\x9d Hurree whispered, as the ritual went on and the\r\ntwo whites followed the grass-blade sweeping from Hell to Heaven and\r\nback again. \xe2\x80\x9cAll their books are in the large _kilta_ with the reddish\r\ntop\xe2\x80\x94books and reports and maps\xe2\x80\x94and I have seen a King\xe2\x80\x99s letter that\r\neither Hil\xc3\xa1s or Bun\xc3\xa1r has written. They guard it most carefully. They\r\nhave sent nothing back from Hil\xc3\xa1s or Leh. That is sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the _beegar_-coolies. They have no servants. They are so close\r\nthey cook their own food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait and see. Only if any chance comes to me thou wilt know where to\r\nseek for the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis were better in Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s hands than a Bengali\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim\r\nscornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are more ways of getting to a sweetheart than butting down a\r\nwall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here the Hell appointed for avarice and greed. Flanked upon the\r\none side by Desire and on the other by Weariness.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama warmed to\r\nhis work, and one of the strangers sketched him in the quick-fading\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said at last brusquely. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot understand\r\nhim, but I want that picture. He is a better artist than I. Ask him if\r\nhe will sell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says \xe2\x80\x98No, sar,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d the Babu replied. The lama, of course, would no\r\nmore have parted with his chart to a casual wayfarer than an archbishop\r\nwould pawn the holy vessels of his cathedral. All Tibet is full of\r\ncheap reproductions of the Wheel; but the lama was an artist, as well\r\nas a wealthy Abbot in his own place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps in three days, or four, or ten, if I perceive that the Sahib\r\nis a Seeker and of good understanding, I may myself draw him another.\r\nBut _this_ was used for the initiation of a novice. Tell him so,\r\n_hakim_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wishes it now\xe2\x80\x94for money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama shook his head slowly and began to fold up the Wheel. The\r\nRussian, on his side, saw no more than an unclean old man haggling over\r\na dirty piece of paper. He drew out a handful of rupees, and snatched\r\nhalf-jestingly at the chart, which tore in the lama\xe2\x80\x99s grip. A low\r\nmurmur of horror went up from the coolies\xe2\x80\x94some of whom were Spiti men\r\nand, by their lights, good Buddhists. The lama rose at the insult; his\r\nhand went to the heavy iron pencase that is the priest\xe2\x80\x99s weapon, and\r\nthe Babu danced in agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you see\xe2\x80\x94you see why I wanted witnesses. They are highly\r\nunscrupulous people. Oh, sar! sar! You must _not_ hit holyman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Chela!_ He has defiled the Written Word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was too late. Before Kim could ward him off, the Russian struck the\r\nold man full on the face. Next instant he was rolling over and over\r\ndownhill with Kim at his throat. The blow had waked every unknown Irish\r\ndevil in the boy\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and the sudden fall of his enemy did the\r\nrest. The lama dropped to his knees, half-stunned; the coolies under\r\ntheir loads fled up the hill as fast as plainsmen run aross the level.\r\nThey had seen sacrilege unspeakable, and it behoved them to get away\r\nbefore the Gods and devils of the hills took vengeance. The Frenchman\r\nran towards the lama, fumbling at his revolver with some notion of\r\nmaking him a hostage for his companion. A shower of cutting\r\nstones\xe2\x80\x94hillmen are very straight shots\xe2\x80\x94drove him away, and a coolie\r\nfrom Ao-chung snatched the lama into the stampede. All came about as\r\nswiftly as the sudden mountain-darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have taken the baggage and all the guns,\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the Frenchman,\r\nfiring blindly into the twilight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, sar! All right! Don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot. I go to rescue,\xe2\x80\x9d and Hurree,\r\npounding down the slope, cast himself bodily upon the delighted and\r\nastonished Kim, who was banging his breathless foe\xe2\x80\x99s head against a\r\nboulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to the coolies,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Babu in his ear. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have the\r\nbaggage. The papers are in the _kilta_ with the red top, but look\r\nthrough all. Take their papers, and specially the _murasla_ (King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter). Go! The other man comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim tore uphill. A revolver-bullet rang on a rock by his side, and he\r\ncowered partridge-wise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you shoot,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Hurree, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will descend and annihilate us. I\r\nhave rescued the gentleman, sar. This is par_tic_ularly dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim was thinking hard in English. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is dam\xe2\x80\x99-tight place,\r\nbut _I_ think it is self-defence.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt in his bosom for Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngift, and uncertainly\xe2\x80\x94save for a few practice shots in the Bikanir\r\ndesert, he had never used the little gun\xe2\x80\x94pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I say, sar!\xe2\x80\x9d The Babu seemed to be in tears. \xe2\x80\x9cCome down here\r\nand assist to resuscitate. We are all up a tree, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shots ceased. There was a sound of stumbling feet, and Kim hurried\r\nupward through the gloom, swearing like a cat\xe2\x80\x94or a country-bred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they wound thee, _chela?_\xe2\x80\x9d called the lama above him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. And thou?\xe2\x80\x9d He dived into a clump of stunted firs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhurt. Come away. We go with these folk to Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not before we have done justice,\xe2\x80\x9d a voice cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got the\r\nSahibs\xe2\x80\x99 guns\xe2\x80\x94all four. Let us go down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe struck the Holy One\xe2\x80\x94we saw it! Our cattle will be barren\xe2\x80\x94our wives\r\nwill cease to bear! The snows will slide upon us as we go home... Atop\r\nof all other oppression too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little fir-clump filled with clamouring coolies\xe2\x80\x94panic-stricken, and\r\nin their terror capable of anything. The man from Ao-chung clicked the\r\nbreech-bolt of his gun impatiently, and made as to go downhill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, Holy One; they cannot go far. Wait till I return,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is this person who has suffered wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, his hand\r\nover his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that very reason,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this person overlooks it, your hands are clean. Moreover, ye\r\nacquire merit by obedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, and we will all go to Shamlegh together,\xe2\x80\x9d the man insisted.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, for just so long as it needs to stuff a cartridge into a\r\nbreech-loader, the lama hesitated. Then he rose to his feet, and laid a\r\nfinger on the man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou heard? _I_ say there shall be no killing\xe2\x80\x94I who was Abbot of\r\nSuch-zen. Is it any lust of thine to be re-born as a rat, or a snake\r\nunder the eaves\xe2\x80\x94a worm in the belly of the most mean beast? Is it thy\r\nwish to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man from Ao-chung fell to his knees, for the voice boomed like a\r\nTibetan devil-gong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAi! ai!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Spiti men. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not curse us\xe2\x80\x94do not curse him. It\r\nwas but his zeal, Holy One! ... Put down the rifle, fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnger on anger! Evil on evil! There will be no killing. Let the\r\npriest-beaters go in bondage to their own acts. Just and sure is the\r\nWheel, swerving not a hair! They will be born many times\xe2\x80\x94in torment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis head drooped, and he leaned heavily on Kim\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come near to great evil, _chela_,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered in that dead\r\nhush under the pines. \xe2\x80\x9cI was tempted to loose the bullet; and truly, in\r\nTibet there would have been a heavy and a slow death for them ... He\r\nstruck me across the face ... upon the flesh ...\xe2\x80\x9d He slid to the\r\nground, breathing heavily, and Kim could hear the over-driven heart\r\nbump and check.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they hurt him to the death?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ao-chung man, while the\r\nothers stood mute.\r\n\r\nKim knelt over the body in deadly fear. \xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried passionately,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis is only a weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he remembered that he was a white man,\r\nwith a white man\xe2\x80\x99s camp-fittings at his service. \xe2\x80\x9cOpen the _kiltas!_\r\nThe Sahibs may have a medicine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! Then I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ao-chung man with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cNot for\r\nfive years was I Yankling Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s _shikarri_ without knowing that\r\nmedicine. I too have tasted it. Behold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew from his breast a bottle of cheap whisky\xe2\x80\x94such as is sold to\r\nexplorers at Leh\xe2\x80\x94and cleverly forced a little between the lama\xe2\x80\x99s teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I did when Yankling Sahib twisted his foot beyond Astor. Aha! I\r\nhave already looked into their baskets\xe2\x80\x94but we will make fair division\r\nat Shamlegh. Give him a little more. It is good medicine. Feel! His\r\nheart goes better now. Lay his head down and rub a little on the chest.\r\nIf he had waited quietly while I accounted for the Sahibs this would\r\nnever have come. But perhaps the Sahibs may chase us here. Then it\r\nwould not be wrong to shoot them with their own guns, heh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is paid, I think, already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim between his teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI kicked\r\nhim in the groin as we went downhill. Would I had killed him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well to be brave when one does not live in Rampur,\xe2\x80\x9d said one\r\nwhose hut lay within a few miles of the Rajah\xe2\x80\x99s rickety palace. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\r\nget a bad name among the Sahibs, none will employ us as _shikarris_ any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but these are not Angrezi Sahibs\xe2\x80\x94not merry-minded men like Fostum\r\nSahib or Yankling Sahib. They are foreigners\xe2\x80\x94they cannot speak Angrezi\r\nas do Sahibs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the lama coughed and sat up, groping for the rosary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere shall be no killing,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cJust is the Wheel! Evil on\r\nevil\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Holy One. We are all here.\xe2\x80\x9d The Ao-chung man timidly patted his\r\nfeet. \xe2\x80\x9cExcept by thy order, no one shall be slain. Rest awhile. We will\r\nmake a little camp here, and later, as the moon rises, we go to\r\nShamlegh-under-the-Snow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a blow,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Spiti man sententiously, \xe2\x80\x9cit is best to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is, as it were, a dizziness at the back of my neck, and a\r\npinching in it. Let me lay my head on thy lap, _chela_. I am an old\r\nman, but not free from passion ... We must think of the Cause of\r\nThings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him a blanket. We dare not light a fire lest the Sahibs see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter get away to Shamlegh. None will follow us to Shamlegh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the nervous Rampur man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been Fostum Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s _shikarri_, and I am Yankling Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_shikarri_. I should have been with Yankling Sahib now but for this\r\ncursed _beegar_ (the _corv\xc3\xa9e_). Let two men watch below with the guns\r\nlest the Sahibs do more foolishness. _I_ shall not leave this Holy\r\nOne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat down a little apart from the lama, and, after listening\r\nawhile, passed round a water-pipe whose receiver was an old Day and\r\nMartin blacking-bottle. The glow of the red charcoal as it went from\r\nhand to hand lit up the narrow, blinking eyes, the high Chinese\r\ncheek-bones, and the bull-throats that melted away into the dark duffle\r\nfolds round the shoulders. They looked like kobolds from some magic\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x94gnomes of the hills in conclave. And while they talked, the voices\r\nof the snow-waters round them diminished one by one as the night-frost\r\nchoked and clogged the runnels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow he stood up against us!\xe2\x80\x9d said a Spiti man admiring. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember an\r\nold ibex, out Ladakh-way, that Dupont Sahib missed on a shoulder-shot,\r\nseven seasons back, standing up just like him. Dupont Sahib was a good\r\n_shikarri_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as good as Yankling Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d The Ao-chung man took a pull at the\r\nwhisky-bottle and passed it over. \xe2\x80\x9cNow hear me\xe2\x80\x94unless any other man\r\nthinks he knows more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe challenge was not taken up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe go to Shamlegh when the moon rises. There we will fairly divide the\r\nbaggage between us. I am content with this new little rifle and all its\r\ncartridges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the bears only bad on thy holding? said a mate, sucking at the\r\npipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but musk-pods are worth six rupees apiece now, and thy women can\r\nhave the canvas of the tents and some of the cooking-gear. We will do\r\nall that at Shamlegh before dawn. Then we all go our ways, remembering\r\nthat we have never seen or taken service with these Sahibs, who may,\r\nindeed, say that we have stolen their baggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well for thee, but what will our Rajah say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is to tell him? Those Sahibs, who cannot speak our talk, or the\r\nBabu, who for his own ends gave us money? Will _he_ lead an army\r\nagainst us? What evidence will remain? That we do not need we shall\r\nthrow on Shamlegh-midden, where no man has yet set foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is at Shamlegh this summer?\xe2\x80\x9d The place was only a grazing centre\r\nof three or four huts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Woman of Shamlegh. _She_ has no love for Sahibs, as we know. The\r\nothers can be pleased with little presents; and here is enough for us\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d He patted the fat sides of the nearest basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said they are not true Sahibs. All their skins and heads were\r\nbought in the bazar at Leh. _I_ know the marks. I showed them to ye\r\nlast march.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. They were all bought skins and heads. Some had even the moth in\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a shrewd argument, and the Ao-chung man knew his fellows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the worst comes to the worst, I shall tell Yankling Sahib, who is a\r\nman of a merry mind, and he will laugh. We are not doing any wrong to\r\nany Sahibs whom we know. _They_ are priest-beaters. They frightened us.\r\nWe fled! Who knows where we dropped the baggage? Do ye think Yankling\r\nSahib will permit down-country police to wander all over the hills,\r\ndisturbing his game? It is a far cry from Simla to Chini, and farther\r\nfrom Shamlegh to Shamlegh-midden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it, but I carry the big _kilta_. The basket with the red top\r\nthat the Sahibs pack themselves every morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus it is proved,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Shamlegh man adroitly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they are\r\nSahibs of no account. Who ever heard of Fostum Sahib, or Yankling\r\nSahib, or even the little Peel Sahib that sits up of nights to shoot\r\nserow\xe2\x80\x94I say, who, ever heard of these Sahibs coming into the hills\r\nwithout a down-country cook, and a bearer, and\xe2\x80\x94and all manner of\r\nwell-paid, high-handed and oppressive folk in their tail? How can they\r\nmake trouble? What of the _kilta?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, but that it is full of the Written Word\xe2\x80\x94books and papers in\r\nwhich they wrote, and strange instruments, as of worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShamlegh-midden will take them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue! But how if we insult the Sahibs\xe2\x80\x99 Gods thereby! I do not like to\r\nhandle the Written Word in that fashion. And their brass idols are\r\nbeyond my comprehension. It is no plunder for simple hill-folk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old man still sleeps. Hst! We will ask his _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d The Ao-chung\r\nman refreshed himself, and swelled with pride of leadership.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have here,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9ca _kilta_ whose nature we do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim cautiously. The lama drew breath in natural, easy\r\nsleep, and Kim had been thinking of Hurree\xe2\x80\x99s last words. As a player of\r\nthe Great Game, he was disposed just then to reverence the Babu. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\na _kilta_ with a red top full of very wonderful things, not to be\r\nhandled by fools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said it; I said it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the bearer of that burden. \xe2\x80\x9cThinkest thou\r\nit will betray us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if it be given to me. I can draw out its magic. Otherwise it will\r\ndo great harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA priest always takes his share.\xe2\x80\x9d Whisky was demoralizing the Ao-chung\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no matter to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim answered, with the craft of his\r\nmother-country. \xe2\x80\x9cShare it among you, and see what comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I. I was only jesting. Give the order. There is more than enough\r\nfor us all. We go our way from Shamlegh in the dawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey arranged and re-arranged their artless little plans for another\r\nhour, while Kim shivered with cold and pride. The humour of the\r\nsituation tickled the Irish and the Oriental in his soul. Here were the\r\nemissaries of the dread Power of the North, very possibly as great in\r\ntheir own land as Mahbub or Colonel Creighton, suddenly smitten\r\nhelpless. One of them, he privately knew, would be lame for a time.\r\nThey had made promises to Kings. Tonight they lay out somewhere below\r\nhim, chartless, foodless, tentless, gunless\xe2\x80\x94except for Hurree Babu,\r\nguideless. And this collapse of their Great Game (Kim wondered to whom\r\nthey would report it), this panicky bolt into the night, had come about\r\nthrough no craft of Hurree\xe2\x80\x99s or contrivance of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s, but simply,\r\nbeautifully, and inevitably as the capture of Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s _faquir_-friends\r\nby the zealous young policeman at Umballa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are there\xe2\x80\x94with nothing; and, by Jove, it is cold! I am here with\r\nall their things. Oh, they will be angry! I am sorry for Hurree Babu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim might have saved his pity, for though at that moment the Bengali\r\nsuffered acutely in the flesh, his soul was puffed and lofty. A mile\r\ndown the hill, on the edge of the pine-forest, two half-frozen men\xe2\x80\x94one\r\npowerfully sick at intervals\xe2\x80\x94were varying mutual recriminations with\r\nthe most poignant abuse of the Babu, who seemed distraught with terror.\r\nThey demanded a plan of action. He explained that they were very lucky\r\nto be alive; that their coolies, if not then stalking them, had passed\r\nbeyond recall; that the Rajah, his master, was ninety miles away, and,\r\nso far from lending them money and a retinue for the Simla journey,\r\nwould surely cast them into prison if he heard that they had hit a\r\npriest. He enlarged on this sin and its consequences till they bade him\r\nchange the subject. Their one hope, said he, was unostentatious flight\r\nfrom village to village till they reached civilization; and, for the\r\nhundredth time dissolved in tears, he demanded of the high stars why\r\nthe Sahibs \xe2\x80\x9chad beaten holy man\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nTen steps would have taken Hurree into the creaking gloom utterly\r\nbeyond their reach\xe2\x80\x94to the shelter and food of the nearest village,\r\nwhere glib-tongued doctors were scarce. But he preferred to endure\r\ncold, belly-pinch, bad words, and occasional blows in the company of\r\nhis honoured employers. Crouched against a tree-trunk, he sniffed\r\ndolefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said the uninjured man hotly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat sort of\r\nspectacle we shall present wandering through these hills among these\r\naborigines?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHurree Babu had thought of little else for some hours, but the remark\r\nwas not to his address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot wander! I can hardly walk,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Kim\xe2\x80\x99s victim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the holy man will be merciful in loving-kindness, sar,\r\notherwise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise myself a peculiar pleasure in emptying my revolver into that\r\nyoung bonze when next we meet,\xe2\x80\x9d was the unchristian answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRevolvers! Vengeance! Bonzes!\xe2\x80\x9d Hurree crouched lower. The war was\r\nbreaking out afresh. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no consideration for our loss? The\r\nbaggage! The baggage!\xe2\x80\x9d He could hear the speaker literally dancing on\r\nthe grass. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything we bore! Everything we have secured! Our gains!\r\nEight months\xe2\x80\x99 work! Do you know what that means? \xe2\x80\x98Decidedly it is we\r\nwho can deal with Orientals!\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, you have done well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey fell to it in several tongues, and Hurree smiled. Kim was with the\r\n_kiltas_, and in the _kiltas_ lay eight months of good diplomacy. There\r\nwas no means of communicating with the boy, but he could be trusted.\r\nFor the rest, Hurree could so stage-manage the journey through the\r\nhills that Hil\xc3\xa1s, Bun\xc3\xa1r, and four hundred miles of hill-roads should\r\ntell the tale for a generation. Men who cannot control their own\r\ncoolies are little respected in the Hills, and the hillman has a very\r\nkeen sense of humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had done it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Hurree, \xe2\x80\x9cit would not have been\r\nbetter; and, by Jove, now I think of it, of course I arranged it\r\nmyself. How quick I have been! Just when I ran downhill I thought it!\r\nThee outrage was accidental, but onlee me could have worked it\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nall it was dam\xe2\x80\x99-well worth. Consider the moral effect upon these\r\nignorant peoples! No treaties\xe2\x80\x94no papers\xe2\x80\x94no written documents at all\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n_me_ to interpret for them. How I shall laugh with the Colonel! I wish\r\nI had their papers also: but you cannot occupy two places in space\r\nsimultaneously. Thatt is axiomatic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brother kneels (so saith Kabir)\r\n    To stone and brass in heathen wise,\r\nBut in my brother\xe2\x80\x99s voice I hear\r\n    My own unanswered agonies.\r\nHis God is as his Fates assign\xe2\x80\x94\r\nHis prayer is all the world\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and mine.\r\n\r\nKABIR.\r\n\r\nAt moonrise the cautious coolies got under way. The lama, refreshed by\r\nhis sleep and the spirit, needed no more than Kim\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder to bear\r\nhim along\xe2\x80\x94a silent, swift-striding man. They held the shale-sprinkled\r\ngrass for an hour, swept round the shoulder of an immortal cliff, and\r\nclimbed into a new country entirely blocked off from all sight of Chini\r\nvalley. A huge pasture-ground ran up fan-shaped to the living snow. At\r\nits base was perhaps half an acre of flat land, on which stood a few\r\nsoil and timber huts. Behind them\xe2\x80\x94for, hill-fashion, they were perched\r\non the edge of all things\xe2\x80\x94the ground fell sheer two thousand feet to\r\nShamlegh-midden, where never yet man has set foot.\r\n\r\nThe men made no motion to divide the plunder till they had seen the\r\nlama bedded down in the best room of the place, with Kim shampooing his\r\nfeet, Mohammedan-fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will send food,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ao-chung man, \xe2\x80\x9cand the red-topped\r\n_kilta_. By dawn there will be none to give evidence, one way or the\r\nother. If anything is not needed in the _kilta_\xe2\x80\x94see here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed through the window\xe2\x80\x94opening into space that was filled with\r\nmoonlight reflected from the snow\xe2\x80\x94and threw out an empty whisky-bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need to listen for the fall. This is the world\xe2\x80\x99s end,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and\r\nwent out. The lama looked forth, a hand on either sill, with eyes that\r\nshone like yellow opals. From the enormous pit before him white peaks\r\nlifted themselves yearning to the moonlight. The rest was as the\r\ndarkness of interstellar space.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9care indeed my Hills. Thus should a man abide,\r\nperched above the world, separated from delights, considering vast\r\nmatters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if he has a _chela_ to prepare tea for him, and to fold a blanket\r\nfor his head, and to chase out calving cows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA smoky lamp burned in a niche, but the full moonlight beat it down;\r\nand by the mixed light, stooping above the food-bag and cups, Kim moved\r\nlike a tall ghost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAi! But now I have let the blood cool, my head still beats and drums,\r\nand there is a cord round the back of my neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder. It was a strong blow. May he who dealt it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for my own passions there would have been no evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat evil? Thou hast saved the Sahibs from the death they deserved a\r\nhundred times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lesson is not well learnt, _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama came to rest on a\r\nfolded blanket, as Kim went forward with his evening routine. \xe2\x80\x9cThe blow\r\nwas but a shadow upon a shadow. Evil in itself\xe2\x80\x94my legs weary apace\r\nthese latter days!\xe2\x80\x94it met evil in me: anger, rage, and a lust to return\r\nevil. These wrought in my blood, woke tumult in my stomach, and dazzled\r\nmy ears.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he drank scalding black-tea ceremonially, taking the hot\r\ncup from Kim\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHad I been passionless, the evil blow would have\r\ndone only bodily evil\xe2\x80\x94a scar, or a bruise\xe2\x80\x94which is illusion. But my\r\nmind was _not_ abstracted, for rushed in straightway a lust to let the\r\nSpiti men kill. In fighting that lust, my soul was torn and wrenched\r\nbeyond a thousand blows. Not till I had repeated the Blessings\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\nmeant the Buddhist Beatitudes) \xe2\x80\x9cdid I achieve calm. But the evil\r\nplanted in me by that moment\xe2\x80\x99s carelessness works out to its end. Just\r\nis the Wheel, swerving not a hair! Learn the lesson, _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too high for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am still all shaken. I am\r\nglad I hurt the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt that, sleeping upon thy knees, in the wood below. It disquieted\r\nme in my dreams\xe2\x80\x94the evil in thy soul working through to mine. Yet on\r\nthe other hand\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he loosed his rosary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have acquired merit by saving\r\ntwo lives\xe2\x80\x94the lives of those that wronged me. Now I must see into the\r\nCause of Things. The boat of my soul staggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep, and be strong. That is wisest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meditate. There is a need greater than thou knowest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTill the dawn, hour after hour, as the moonlight paled on the high\r\npeaks, and that which had been belted blackness on the sides of the far\r\nhills showed as tender green forest, the lama stared fixedly at the\r\nwall. From time to time he groaned. Outside the barred door, where\r\ndiscomfited kine came to ask for their old stable, Shamlegh and the\r\ncoolies gave itself up to plunder and riotous living. The Ao-chung man\r\nwas their leader, and once they had opened the Sahibs\xe2\x80\x99 tinned foods and\r\nfound that they were very good they dared not turn back. Shamlegh\r\nkitchen-midden took the dunnage.\r\n\r\nWhen Kim, after a night of bad dreams, stole forth to brush his teeth\r\nin the morning chill, a fair-coloured woman with turquoise-studded\r\nheadgear drew him aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe others have gone. They left thee this _kilta_ as the promise was.\r\nI do not love Sahibs, but thou wilt make us a charm in return for it.\r\nWe do not wish little Shamlegh to get a bad name on account of\r\nthe\xe2\x80\x94accident. I am the Woman of Shamlegh.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked him over with\r\nbold, bright eyes, unlike the usual furtive glance of hillwomen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly. But it must be done in secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised the heavy _kilta_ like a toy and slung it into her own hut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut and bar the door! Let none come near till it is finished,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nKim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut afterwards\xe2\x80\x94we may talk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim tilted the _kilta_ on the floor\xe2\x80\x94a cascade of Survey-instruments,\r\nbooks, diaries, letters, maps, and queerly scented native\r\ncorrespondence. At the very bottom was an embroidered bag covering a\r\nsealed, gilded, and illuminated document such as one King sends to\r\nanother. Kim caught his breath with delight, and reviewed the situation\r\nfrom a Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s point of view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe books I do not want. Besides, they are logarithms\xe2\x80\x94Survey, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid them aside. \xe2\x80\x9cThe letters I do not understand, but\r\nColonel Creighton will. They must all be kept. The maps\xe2\x80\x94they draw\r\nbetter maps than me\xe2\x80\x94of course. All the native letters\xe2\x80\x94oho!\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nparticularly the _murasla_.\xe2\x80\x9d He sniffed the embroidered bag. \xe2\x80\x9cThat must\r\nbe from Hil\xc3\xa1s or Bun\xc3\xa1r, and Hurree Babu spoke truth. By Jove! It is a\r\nfine haul. I wish Hurree could know ... The rest must go out of the\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x9d He fingered a superb prismatic compass and the shiny top of a\r\ntheodolite. But after all, a Sahib cannot very well steal, and the\r\nthings might be inconvenient evidence later. He sorted out every scrap\r\nof manuscript, every map, and the native letters. They made one softish\r\nslab. The three locked ferril-backed books, with five worn\r\npocket-books, he put aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters and the _murasla_ I must carry inside my coat and under my\r\nbelt, and the hand-written books I must put into the food-bag. It will\r\nbe very heavy. No. I do not think there is anything more. If there is,\r\nthe coolies have thrown it down the _khud_, so _thatt_ is all right.\r\nNow you go too.\xe2\x80\x9d He repacked the _kilta_ with all he meant to lose, and\r\nhove it up on to the windowsill. A thousand feet below lay a long,\r\nlazy, round-shouldered bank of mist, as yet untouched by the morning\r\nsun. A thousand feet below that was a hundred-year-old pine-forest. He\r\ncould see the green tops looking like a bed of moss when a wind-eddy\r\nthinned the cloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any one will go after _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wheeling basket vomited its contents as it dropped. The theodolite\r\nhit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books,\r\ninkstands, paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed for a few seconds\r\nlike a swarm of bees. Then they vanished; and, though Kim, hanging half\r\nout of the window, strained his young ears, never a sound came up from\r\nthe gulf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred\xe2\x80\x94a thousand rupees could not buy them,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought\r\nsorrowfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was verree wasteful, but I have all their other\r\nstuff\xe2\x80\x94everything they did\xe2\x80\x94I hope. Now how the deuce am I to tell Hurree\r\nBabu, and _whatt_ the deuce am I to do? And my old man is sick. I must\r\ntie up the letters in oilskin. That is something to do first\xe2\x80\x94else they\r\nwill get all sweated ... And I am all alone!\xe2\x80\x9d He bound them into a neat\r\npacket, swedging down the stiff, sticky oilskin at the comers, for his\r\nroving life had made him as methodical as an old hunter in matters of\r\nthe road. Then with double care he packed away the books at the bottom\r\nof the food-bag.\r\n\r\nThe woman rapped at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou hast made no charm,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim had completely overlooked the necessity for a\r\nlittle patter-talk. The woman laughed at his confusion irreverently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone\xe2\x80\x94for thee. Thou canst cast a spell by the mere winking of an eye.\r\nBut think of us poor people when thou art gone. They were all too drunk\r\nlast night to hear a woman. Thou art not drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a priest.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim had recovered himself, and, the woman being aught\r\nbut unlovely, thought best to stand on his office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warned them that the Sahibs will be angry and will make an\r\ninquisition and a report to the Rajah. There is also the Babu with\r\nthem. Clerks have long tongues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all thy trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d The plan rose fully formed in Kim\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\r\nand he smiled ravishingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot all,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the woman, putting out a hard brown hand all covered\r\nwith turquoises set in silver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can finish that in a breath,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Babu is the\r\nvery _hakim_ (thou hast heard of him?) who was wandering among the\r\nhills by Ziglaur. I know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will tell for the sake of a reward. Sahibs cannot distinguish one\r\nhillman from another, but Babus have eyes for men\xe2\x80\x94and women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry a word to him from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing I would not do for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe accepted the compliment calmly, as men must in lands where women\r\nmake the love, tore a leaf from a note-book, and with a patent\r\nindelible pencil wrote in gross Shikast\xe2\x80\x94the script that bad little boys\r\nuse when they write dirt on walls: \xe2\x80\x9c_I have everything that they have\r\nwritten: their pictures of the country, and many letters. Especially\r\nthe murasla. Tell me what to do. I am at Shamlegh-under-the-Snow. The\r\nold man is sick._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this to him. It will altogether shut his mouth. He cannot have\r\ngone far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed no. They are still in the forest across the spur. Our children\r\nwent to watch them when the light came, and have cried the news as they\r\nmoved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim looked his astonishment; but from the edge of the sheep-pasture\r\nfloated a shrill, kite-like trill. A child tending cattle had picked it\r\nup from a brother or sister on the far side of the slope that commanded\r\nChini valley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husbands are also out there gathering wood.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew a handful of\r\nwalnuts from her bosom, split one neatly, and began to eat. Kim\r\naffected blank ignorance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost thou not know the meaning of the walnut\xe2\x80\x94priest?\xe2\x80\x9d she said coyly,\r\nand handed him the half-shells.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d He slipped the piece of paper between them quickly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou a little wax to close them on this letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman sighed aloud, and Kim relented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no payment till service has been rendered. Carry this to the\r\nBabu, and say it was sent by the Son of the Charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAi! Truly! Truly! By a magician\xe2\x80\x94who is like a Sahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, a Son of the Charm: and ask if there be any answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he offer a rudeness? I\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is, I have no doubt, very tired and very hungry. The\r\nHills make cold bedfellows. Hai, my\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was on the tip of his tongue to\r\nsay Mother, but he turned it to Sister\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthou art a wise and witty\r\nwoman. By this time all the villages know what has befallen the\r\nSahibs\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. News was at Ziglaur by midnight, and by tomorrow should be at\r\nKotgarh. The villages are both afraid and angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need. Tell the villages to feed the Sahibs and pass them on, in\r\npeace. We must get them quietly away from our valleys. To steal is one\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94to kill another. The Babu will understand, and there will be no\r\nafter-complaints. Be swift. I must tend my master when he wakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it. After service\xe2\x80\x94thou hast said?\xe2\x80\x94comes the reward. I am the\r\nWoman of Shamlegh, and I hold from the Rajah. I am no common bearer of\r\nbabes. Shamlegh is thine: hoof and horn and hide, milk and butter. Take\r\nor leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned resolutely uphill, her silver necklaces clicking on her\r\nbroad breast, to meet the morning sun fifteen hundred feet above them.\r\nThis time Kim thought in the vernacular as he waxed down the oilskin\r\nedges of the packets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can a man follow the Way or the Great Game when he is so\xe2\x80\x94always\r\npestered by women? There was that girl at Akrola of the Ford; and there\r\nwas the scullion\xe2\x80\x99s wife behind the dovecot\xe2\x80\x94not counting the others\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnow comes this one! When I was a child it was well enough, but now I am\r\na man and they will not regard me as a man. Walnuts, indeed! Ho! ho! It\r\nis almonds in the Plains!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out to levy on the village\xe2\x80\x94not with a begging-bowl, which might\r\ndo for down-country, but in the manner of a prince. Shamlegh\xe2\x80\x99s summer\r\npopulation is only three families\xe2\x80\x94four women and eight or nine men.\r\nThey were all full of tinned meats and mixed drinks, from ammoniated\r\nquinine to white vodka, for they had taken their full share in the\r\novernight loot. The neat Continental tents had been cut up and shared\r\nlong ago, and there were patent aluminium saucepans abroad.\r\n\r\nBut they considered the lama\xe2\x80\x99s presence a perfect safeguard against all\r\nconsequences, and impenitently brought Kim of their best\xe2\x80\x94even to a\r\ndrink of _chang_\xe2\x80\x94the barley-beer that comes from Ladakh-way. Then they\r\nthawed out in the sun, and sat with their legs hanging over infinite\r\nabysses, chattering, laughing, and smoking. They judged India and its\r\nGovernment solely from their experience of wandering Sahibs who had\r\nemployed them or their friends as _shikarris_. Kim heard tales of shots\r\nmissed upon ibex, serow, or markhor, by Sahibs twenty years in their\r\ngraves\xe2\x80\x94every detail lighted from behind like twigs on tree-tops seen\r\nagainst lightning. They told him of their little diseases, and, more\r\nimportant, the diseases of their tiny, sure-footed cattle; of trips as\r\nfar as Kotgarh, where the strange missionaries live, and beyond even to\r\nmarvellous Simla, where the streets are paved with silver, and anyone,\r\nlook you, can get service with the Sahibs, who ride about in\r\ntwo-wheeled carts and spend money with a spade. Presently, grave and\r\naloof, walking very heavily, the lama joined himself to the chatter\r\nunder the eaves, and they gave him great room. The thin air refreshed\r\nhim, and he sat on the edge of precipices with the best of them, and,\r\nwhen talk languished, flung pebbles into the void. Thirty miles away,\r\nas the eagle flies, lay the next range, seamed and channelled and\r\npitted with little patches of brush\xe2\x80\x94forests, each a day\xe2\x80\x99s dark march.\r\nBehind the village, Shamlegh hill itself cut off all view to southward.\r\nIt was like sitting in a swallow\xe2\x80\x99s nest under the eaves of the roof of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the lama stretched out his hand, and with a little\r\nlow-voiced prompting would point out the road to Spiti and north across\r\nthe Parungla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeyond, where the hills lie thickest, lies De-ch\xe2\x80\x99en\xe2\x80\x9d (he meant\r\nHan-l\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99), \xe2\x80\x9cthe great Monastery. s\xe2\x80\x99Tag-stan-ras-ch\xe2\x80\x99en built it, and of\r\nhim there runs this tale.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereupon he told it: a fantastic piled\r\nnarrative of bewitchment and miracles that set Shamlegh a-gasping.\r\nTurning west a little, he steered for the green hills of Kulu, and\r\nsought Kailung under the glaciers. \xe2\x80\x9cFor thither came I in the old, old\r\ndays. From Leh I came, over the Baralachi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; we know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the far-faring people of Shamlegh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I slept two nights with the priests of Kailung. These are the\r\nHills of my delight! Shadows blessed above all other shadows! There my\r\neyes opened on this world; there my eyes were opened to this world;\r\nthere I found Enlightenment; and there I girt my loins for my Search.\r\nOut of the Hills I came\xe2\x80\x94the high Hills and the strong winds. Oh, just\r\nis the Wheel!\xe2\x80\x9d He blessed them in detail\xe2\x80\x94the great glaciers, the naked\r\nrocks, the piled moraines and tumbled shale; dry upland, hidden\r\nsalt-lake, age-old timber and fruitful water-shot valley one after the\r\nother, as a dying man blesses his folk; and Kim marvelled at his\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes. There is no place like our Hills,\xe2\x80\x9d said the people of\r\nShamlegh. And they fell to wondering how a man could live in the hot\r\nterrible Plains where the cattle run as big as elephants, unfit to\r\nplough on a hillside; where village touches village, they had heard,\r\nfor a hundred miles; where folk went about stealing in gangs, and what\r\nthe robbers spared the Police carried utterly away.\r\n\r\nSo the still forenoon wore through, and at the end of it Kim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmessenger dropped from the steep pasture as unbreathed as when she had\r\nset out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent a word to the _hakim_,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim explained, while she made\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe joined himself to the idolaters? Nay, I remember he did a healing\r\nupon one of them. He has acquired merit, though the healed employed his\r\nstrength for evil. Just is the Wheel! What of the _hakim?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feared that thou hadst been bruised and\xe2\x80\x94and I knew he was wise.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim\r\ntook the waxed walnut-shell and read in English on the back of his\r\nnote: _Your favour received. Cannot get away from present company at\r\npresent, but shall take them into Simla. After which, hope to rejoin\r\nyou. Inexpedient to follow angry gentlemen. Return by same road you\r\ncame, and will overtake. Highly gratified about correspondence due to\r\nmy forethought._ \xe2\x80\x9cHe says, Holy One, that he will escape from the\r\nidolaters, and will return to us. Shall we wait awhile at Shamlegh,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lama looked long and lovingly upon the hills and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may not be, _chela_. From my bones outward I do desire it, but it\r\nis forbidden. I have seen the Cause of Things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? When the Hills give thee back thy strength day by day? Remember\r\nwe were weak and fainting down below there in the Doon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI became strong to do evil and to forget. A brawler and a swashbuckler\r\nupon the hillsides was I.\xe2\x80\x9d Kim bit back a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cJust and perfect is\r\nthe Wheel, swerving not a hair. When I was a man\xe2\x80\x94a long time ago\xe2\x80\x94I did\r\npilgrimage to Guru Ch\xe2\x80\x99wan among the poplars\xe2\x80\x9d (he pointed Bhotanwards),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhere they keep the Sacred Horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet, be quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Shamlegh, all arow. \xe2\x80\x9cHe speaks of\r\nJam-lin-nin-k\xe2\x80\x99or, the Horse That Can Go Round The World In a Day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak to my _chela_ only,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, in gentle reproof, and\r\nthey scattered like frost on south eaves of a morning. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not seek\r\ntruth in those days, but the talk of doctrine. All illusion! I drank\r\nthe beer and ate the bread of Guru Ch\xe2\x80\x99wan. Next day one said: \xe2\x80\x98We go\r\nout to fight Sangor Gutok down the valley to discover\xe2\x80\x99 (mark again how\r\nLust is tied to Anger!) \xe2\x80\x98which Abbot shall bear rule in the valley and\r\ntake the profit of the prayers they print at Sangor Gutok.\xe2\x80\x99 I went, and\r\nwe fought a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how, Holy One?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith our long pencases as I could have shown ... I say, we fought\r\nunder the poplars, both Abbots and all the monks, and one laid open my\r\nforehead to the bone. See!\xe2\x80\x9d He tilted back his cap and showed a\r\npuckered silvery scar. \xe2\x80\x9cJust and perfect is the Wheel! Yesterday the\r\nscar itched, and after fifty years I recalled how it was dealt and the\r\nface of him who dealt it; dwelling a little in illusion. Followed that\r\nwhich thou didst see\xe2\x80\x94strife and stupidity. Just is the Wheel! The\r\nidolater\xe2\x80\x99s blow fell upon the scar. Then I was shaken in my soul: my\r\nsoul was darkened, and the boat of my soul rocked upon the waters of\r\nillusion. Not till I came to Shamlegh could I meditate upon the Cause\r\nof Things, or trace the running grass-roots of Evil. I strove all the\r\nlong night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Holy One, thou art innocent of all evil. May I be thy sacrifice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim was genuinely distressed at the old man\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, and Mahbub Ali\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphrase slipped out unawares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the dawn,\xe2\x80\x9d the lama went on more gravely, ready rosary clicking\r\nbetween the slow sentences, \xe2\x80\x9ccame enlightenment. It is here ... I am an\r\nold man ... hill-bred, hill-fed, never to sit down among my Hills.\r\nThree years I travelled through Hind, but\xe2\x80\x94can earth be stronger than\r\nMother Earth? My stupid body yearned to the Hills and the snows of the\r\nHills, from below there. I said, and it is true, my Search is sure. So,\r\nat the Kulu woman\xe2\x80\x99s house I turned hillward, over-persuaded by myself.\r\nThere is no blame to the _hakim_. He\xe2\x80\x94following Desire\xe2\x80\x94foretold that the\r\nHills would make me strong. They strengthened me to do evil, to forget\r\nmy Search. I delighted in life and the lust of life. I desired strong\r\nslopes to climb. I cast about to find them. I measured the strength of\r\nmy body, which is evil, against the high Hills, I made a mock of thee\r\nwhen thy breath came short under Jamnotri. I jested when thou wouldst\r\nnot face the snow of the pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what harm? I _was_ afraid. It was just. I am not a hillman; and I\r\nloved thee for thy new strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than once I remember\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he rested his cheek dolefully on his\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI sought thy praise and the _hakim\xe2\x80\x99s_ for the mere strength of my\r\nlegs. Thus evil followed evil till the cup was full. Just is the Wheel!\r\nAll Hind for three years did me all honour. From the Fountain of Wisdom\r\nin the Wonder House to\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he smiled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca little child playing by a big\r\ngun\xe2\x80\x94the world prepared my road. And why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we loved thee. It is only the fever of the blow. I myself am\r\nstill sick and shaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! It was because I was upon the Way\xe2\x80\x94tuned as are _si-nen_ (cymbals)\r\nto the purpose of the Law. I departed from that ordinance. The tune was\r\nbroken: followed the punishment. In my own Hills, on the edge of my own\r\ncountry, in the very place of my evil desire, comes the buffet\xe2\x80\x94here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(He touched his brow.) \xe2\x80\x9cAs a novice is beaten when he misplaces the\r\ncups, so am I beaten, who was Abbot of Such-zen. No word, look you, but\r\na blow, _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Sahibs did not know thee, Holy One?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were well matched. Ignorance and Lust met Ignorance and Lust upon\r\nthe road, and they begat Anger. The blow was a sign to me, who am no\r\nbetter than a strayed yak, that my place is not here. Who can read the\r\nCause of an act is halfway to Freedom! \xe2\x80\x98Back to the path,\xe2\x80\x99 says the\r\nBlow. \xe2\x80\x98The Hills are not for thee. Thou canst not choose Freedom and go\r\nin bondage to the delight of life.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould we had never met that cursed Russian!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Lord Himself cannot make the Wheel swing backward. And for my\r\nmerit that I had acquired I gain yet another sign.\xe2\x80\x9d He put his hand in\r\nhis bosom, and drew forth the Wheel of Life. \xe2\x80\x9cLook! I considered this\r\nafter I had meditated. There remains untorn by the idolater no more\r\nthan the breadth of my fingernail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much, then, is the span of my life in this body. I have served the\r\nWheel all my days. Now the Wheel serves me. But for the merit I have\r\nacquired in guiding thee upon the Way, there would have been added to\r\nme yet another life ere I had found my River. Is it plain, _chela?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim stared at the brutally disfigured chart. From left to right\r\ndiagonally the rent ran\xe2\x80\x94from the Eleventh House where Desire gives\r\nbirth to the Child (as it is drawn by Tibetans)\xe2\x80\x94across the human and\r\nanimal worlds, to the Fifth House\xe2\x80\x94the empty House of the Senses. The\r\nlogic was unanswerable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore our Lord won Enlightenment\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the lama folded all away with\r\nreverence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe was tempted. I too have been tempted, but it is finished.\r\nThe Arrow fell in the Plains\xe2\x80\x94not in the Hills. Therefore, what make we\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we at least wait for the _hakim?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how long I shall live in this body. What can a _hakim_ do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou art all sick and shaken. Thou canst not walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I be sick if I see Freedom?\xe2\x80\x9d He rose unsteadily to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must get food from the village. Oh, the weary Road!\xe2\x80\x9d Kim felt\r\nthat he too needed rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is lawful. Let us eat and go. The Arrow fell in the Plains ...\r\nbut I yielded to Desire. Make ready, _chela_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim turned to the woman with the turquoise headgear who had been idly\r\npitching pebbles over the cliff. She smiled very kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found him like a strayed buffalo in a cornfield\xe2\x80\x94the Babu; snorting\r\nand sneezing with cold. He was so hungry that he forgot his dignity and\r\ngave me sweet words. The Sahibs have nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d She flung out an empty\r\npalm. \xe2\x80\x9cOne is very sick about the stomach. Thy work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim nodded, with a bright eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke to the Bengali first\xe2\x80\x94and to the people of a near-by village\r\nafter. The Sahibs will be given food as they need it\xe2\x80\x94nor will the\r\npeople ask money. The plunder is already distributed. The Babu makes\r\nlying speeches to the Sahibs. Why does he not leave them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the greatness of his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas never a Bengali yet had one bigger than a dried walnut. But it is\r\nno matter ... Now as to walnuts. After service comes reward. I have\r\nsaid the village is thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my loss,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim began. \xe2\x80\x9cEven now I had planned desirable things in\r\nmy heart which\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94there is no need to go through the compliments proper\r\nto these occasions. He sighed deeply ... \xe2\x80\x9cBut my master, led by a\r\nvision\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! What can old eyes see except a full begging-bowl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94turns from this village to the Plains again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBid him stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI know my Holy One, and his rage if he be\r\ncrossed,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied impressively. \xe2\x80\x9cHis curses shake the Hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity they did not save him from a broken head! I heard that thou wast\r\nthe tiger-hearted one who smote the Sahib. Let him dream a little\r\nlonger. Stay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillwoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, with austerity that could not harden the\r\noutlines of his young oval face, \xe2\x80\x9cthese matters are too high for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gods be good to us! Since when have men and women been other than\r\nmen and women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA priest is a priest. He says he will go upon this hour. I am his\r\n_chela_, and I go with him. We need food for the Road. He is an\r\nhonoured guest in all the villages, but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he broke into a pure boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe food here is good. Give me some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I do not give it thee? I am the woman of this village.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I curse thee\xe2\x80\x94a little\xe2\x80\x94not greatly, but enough to remember.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ncould not help smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast cursed me already by the down-dropped eyelash and the\r\nuplifted chin. Curses? What should I care for mere words?\xe2\x80\x9d She clenched\r\nher hands upon her bosom ... \xe2\x80\x9cBut I would not have thee to go in anger,\r\nthinking hardly of me\xe2\x80\x94a gatherer of cow-dung and grass at Shamlegh, but\r\nstill a woman of substance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that I am grieved to go, for I am\r\nvery weary; and that we need food. Here is the bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman snatched it angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cI was foolish,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is thy\r\nwoman in the Plains? Fair or black? I was fair once. Laughest thou?\r\nOnce, long ago, if thou canst believe, a Sahib looked on me with\r\nfavour. Once, long ago, I wore European clothes at the Mission-house\r\nyonder.\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed towards Kotgarh. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce, long ago. I was\r\n_Ker-lis-ti-an_ and spoke English\xe2\x80\x94as the Sahibs speak it. Yes. My Sahib\r\nsaid he would return and wed me\xe2\x80\x94yes, wed me. He went away\xe2\x80\x94I had nursed\r\nhim when he was sick\xe2\x80\x94but he never returned. Then I saw that the Gods of\r\nthe Kerlistians lied, and I went back to my own people ... I have never\r\nset eyes on a Sahib since. (Do not laugh at me. The fit is past, little\r\npriestling.) Thy face and thy walk and thy fashion of speech put me in\r\nmind of my Sahib, though thou art only a wandering mendicant to whom I\r\ngive a dole. Curse me? Thou canst neither curse nor bless!\xe2\x80\x9d She set her\r\nhands on her hips and laughed bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cThy Gods are lies; thy works\r\nare lies; thy words are lies. There are no Gods under all the Heavens.\r\nI know it ... But for awhile I thought it was my Sahib come back, and\r\nhe was my God. Yes, once I made music on a _pianno_ in the\r\nMission-house at Kotgarh. Now I give alms to priests who are\r\n_heatthen_.\xe2\x80\x9d She wound up with the English word, and tied the mouth of\r\nthe brimming bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wait for thee, _chela_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, leaning against the\r\ndoor-post.\r\n\r\nThe woman swept the tall figure with her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHe walk! He cannot\r\ncover half a mile. Whither would old bones go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Kim, already perplexed by the lama\xe2\x80\x99s collapse and foreseeing\r\nthe weight of the bag, fairly lost his temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it to thee, woman of ill-omen, where he goes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x94but something to thee, priest with a Sahib\xe2\x80\x99s face. Wilt thou\r\ncarry him on thy shoulders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go to the Plains. None must hinder my return. I have wrestled with\r\nmy soul till I am strengthless. The stupid body is spent, and we are\r\nfar from the Plains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold!\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply, and drew aside to let Kim see his own utter\r\nhelplessness. \xe2\x80\x9cCurse me. Maybe it will give him strength. Make a charm!\r\nCall on thy great God. Thou art a priest.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned away.\r\n\r\nThe lama had squatted limply, still holding by the door-post. One\r\ncannot strike down an old man that he recovers again like a boy in the\r\nnight. Weakness bowed him to the earth, but his eyes that hung on Kim\r\nwere alive and imploring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the thin air that weakens thee. In a\r\nlittle while we go! It is the mountain-sickness. I too am a little sick\r\nat stomach,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he knelt and comforted with such poor words as came\r\nfirst to his lips. Then the woman returned, more erect than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy Gods useless, heh? Try mine. I am the Woman of Shamlegh.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nhailed hoarsely, and there came out of a cow-pen her two husbands and\r\nthree others with a _dooli_, the rude native litter of the Hills, that\r\nthey use for carrying the sick and for visits of state. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\ncattle\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she did not condescend to look at them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care thine for so long\r\nas thou shalt need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we will not go Simla-way. We will not go near the Sahibs,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe first husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not run away as the others did, nor will they steal baggage.\r\nTwo I know for weaklings. Stand to the rear-pole, Sonoo and Taree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey obeyed swiftly. \xe2\x80\x9cLower now, and lift in that holy man. I will see\r\nto the village and your virtuous wives till ye return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the priests. Do not pester me. Lay the food-bag at the foot, it\r\nbalances better so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Holy One, thy Hills are kinder than our Plains!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kim,\r\nrelieved, as the lama tottered to the litter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed\xe2\x80\x94a place of honour and ease. And we owe it to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman of ill-omen. I need thy blessings as much as I do thy curses.\r\nIt is _my_ order and none of thine. Lift and away! Here! Hast thou\r\nmoney for the road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe beckoned Kim to her hut, and stooped above a battered English\r\ncash-box under her cot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not need anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, angered where he should have been\r\ngrateful. \xe2\x80\x9cI am already rudely loaded with favours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up with a curious smile and laid a hand on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nleast, thank me. I am foul-faced and a hillwoman, but, as thy talk\r\ngoes, I have acquired merit. Shall I show thee how the Sahibs render\r\nthanks?\xe2\x80\x9d and her hard eyes softened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am but a wandering priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, his eyes lighting in answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou needest neither my blessings nor my curses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay. But for one little moment\xe2\x80\x94thou canst overtake the _dooli_ in ten\r\nstrides\xe2\x80\x94_if_ thou wast a Sahib, shall I show thee what thou wouldst\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow if I guess, though?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim, and putting his arm round her\r\nwaist, he kissed her on the cheek, adding in English: \xe2\x80\x9cThank you verree\r\nmuch, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKissing is practically unknown among Asiatics, which may have been the\r\nreason that she leaned back with wide-open eyes and a face of panic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext time,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not be so sure of your heatthen\r\npriests. Now I say good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d He held out his hand English-fashion. She\r\ntook it mechanically. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was remembering her English words one by\r\none\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou will come back again? Good-bye, and\xe2\x80\x94thee God bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, as the creaking litter jolted up the hill path that\r\nleads south-easterly from Shamlegh, Kim saw a tiny figure at the hut\r\ndoor waving a white rag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has acquired merit beyond all others,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cFor to set\r\na man upon the way to Freedom is half as great as though she had\r\nherself found it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim thoughtfully, considering the past. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that I\r\nhave acquired merit also ... At least she did not treat me like a\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d He hitched the front of his robe, where lay the slab of\r\ndocuments and maps, re-stowed the precious food-bag at the lama\xe2\x80\x99s feet,\r\nlaid his hand on the litter\xe2\x80\x99s edge, and buckled down to the slow pace\r\nof the grunting husbands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese also acquire merit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama after three miles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than that, they shall be paid in silver,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Kim. The Woman of\r\nShamlegh had given it to him; and it was only fair, he argued, that her\r\nmen should earn it back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d not give room for an Emperor\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    I\xe2\x80\x99d hold my road for a King.\r\nTo the Triple Crown I\xe2\x80\x99d not bow down\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    But this is a different thing!\r\n_I_\xe2\x80\x99ll not fight with the Powers of Air\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Sentries pass him through!\r\nDrawbridge let fall\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s the Lord of us all\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    The Dreamer whose dream came true!\r\n\r\n_The Siege of the Fairies._\r\n\r\nTwo hundred miles north of Chini, on the blue shale of Ladakh, lies\r\nYankling Sahib, the merry-minded man, spy-glassing wrathfully across\r\nthe ridges for some sign of his pet tracker\xe2\x80\x94a man from Ao-chung. But\r\nthat renegade, with a new Mannlicher rifle and two hundred cartridges,\r\nis elsewhere, shooting musk-deer for the market, and Yankling Sahib\r\nwill learn next season how very ill he has been.\r\n\r\nUp the valleys of Bushahr\xe2\x80\x94the far-beholding eagles of the Himalayas\r\nswerve at his new blue-and-white gored umbrella\xe2\x80\x94hurries a Bengali, once\r\nfat and well-looking, now lean and weather-worn. He has received the\r\nthanks of two foreigners of distinction, piloted not unskilfully to\r\nMashobra tunnel, which leads to the great and gay capital of India. It\r\nwas not his fault that, blanketed by wet mists, he conveyed them past\r\nthe telegraph-station and European colony of Kotgarh. It was not his\r\nfault, but that of the Gods, of whom he discoursed so engagingly, that\r\nhe led them into the borders of Nahan, where the Rajah of that state\r\nmistook them for deserting British soldiery. Hurree Babu explained the\r\ngreatness and glory, in their own country, of his companions, till the\r\ndrowsy kinglet smiled. He explained it to everyone who asked\xe2\x80\x94many\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94aloud\xe2\x80\x94variously. He begged food, arranged accommodation, proved a\r\nskilful leech for an injury of the groin\xe2\x80\x94such a blow as one may receive\r\nrolling down a rock-covered hillside in the dark\xe2\x80\x94and in all things\r\nindispensable. The reason of his friendliness did him credit. With\r\nmillions of fellow-serfs, he had learned to look upon Russia as the\r\ngreat deliverer from the North. He was a fearful man. He had been\r\nafraid that he could not save his illustrious employers from the anger\r\nof an excited peasantry. He himself would just as lief hit a holy man\r\nas not, but ... He was deeply grateful and sincerely rejoiced that he\r\nhad done his \xe2\x80\x9clittle possible\xe2\x80\x9d towards bringing their venture\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94barring the lost baggage\xe2\x80\x94a successful issue, he had forgotten the\r\nblows; denied that any blows had been dealt that unseemly first night\r\nunder the pines. He asked neither pension nor retaining fee, but, if\r\nthey deemed him worthy, would they write him a testimonial? It might be\r\nuseful to him later, if others, their friends, came over the Passes. He\r\nbegged them to remember him in their future greatnesses, for he \xe2\x80\x9copined\r\nsubtly\xe2\x80\x9d that he, even he, Mohendro Lal Dutt, MA of Calcutta, had \xe2\x80\x9cdone\r\nthe State some service\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nThey gave him a certificate praising his courtesy, helpfulness, and\r\nunerring skill as a guide. He put it in his waist-belt and sobbed with\r\nemotion; they had endured so many dangers together. He led them at high\r\nnoon along crowded Simla Mall to the Alliance Bank of Simla, where they\r\nwished to establish their identity. Thence he vanished like a\r\ndawn-cloud on Jakko.\r\n\r\nBehold him, too fine-drawn to sweat, too pressed to vaunt the drugs in\r\nhis little brass-bound box, ascending Shamlegh slope, a just man made\r\nperfect. Watch him, all Babudom laid aside, smoking at noon on a cot,\r\nwhile a woman with turquoise-studded headgear points south-easterly\r\nacross the bare grass. Litters, she says, do not travel as fast as\r\nsingle men, but his birds should now be in the Plains. The holy man\r\nwould not stay though Lispeth pressed him. The Babu groans heavily,\r\ngirds up his huge loins, and is off again. He does not care to travel\r\nafter dusk; but his days\xe2\x80\x99 marches\xe2\x80\x94there is none to enter them in a\r\nbook\xe2\x80\x94would astonish folk who mock at his race. Kindly villagers,\r\nremembering the Dacca drug-vendor of two months ago, give him shelter\r\nagainst evil spirits of the wood. He dreams of Bengali Gods, University\r\ntext-books of education, and the Royal Society, London, England. Next\r\ndawn the bobbing blue-and-white umbrella goes forward.\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the Doon, Mussoorie well behind them and the Plains\r\nspread out in golden dust before, rests a worn litter in which\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\nHills know it\xe2\x80\x94lies a sick lama who seeks a River for his healing.\r\nVillages have almost come to blows over the honour of bearing it, for\r\nnot only has the lama given them blessings, but his disciple good\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94full one-third Sahibs\xe2\x80\x99 prices. Twelve miles a day has the _dooli_\r\ntravelled, as the greasy, rubbed pole-ends show, and by roads that few\r\nSahibs use. Over the Nilang Pass in storm when the driven snow-dust\r\nfilled every fold of the impassive lama\xe2\x80\x99s drapery; between the black\r\nhorns of Raieng where they heard the whistle of the wild goats through\r\nthe clouds; pitching and strained on the shale below; hard-held between\r\nshoulder and clenched jaw when they rounded the hideous curves of the\r\nCut Road under Bhagirati; swinging and creaking to the steady jog-trot\r\nof the descent into the Valley of the Waters; pressed along the steamy\r\nlevels of that locked valley; up, up and out again, to meet the roaring\r\ngusts off Kedarnath; set down of mid-days in the dun gloom of kindly\r\noak-forests; passed from village to village in dawn-chill, when even\r\ndevotees may be forgiven for swearing at impatient holy men; or by\r\ntorchlight, when the least fearful think of ghosts\xe2\x80\x94the _dooli_ has\r\nreached her last stage. The little hill-folk sweat in the modified heat\r\nof the lower Siwaliks, and gather round the priests for their blessing\r\nand their wage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe have acquired merit,\xe2\x80\x9d says the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cMerit greater than your\r\nknowing. And ye will return to the Hills,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely. The high Hills as soon as may be.\xe2\x80\x9d The bearer rubs his\r\nshoulder, drinks water, spits it out again, and readjusts his grass\r\nsandal. Kim\xe2\x80\x94his face is drawn and tired\xe2\x80\x94pays very small silver from his\r\nbelt, heaves out the food-bag, crams an oilskin packet\xe2\x80\x94they are holy\r\nwritings\xe2\x80\x94into his bosom, and helps the lama to his feet. The peace has\r\ncome again into the old man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and he does not look for the hills\r\nto fall down and crush him as he did that terrible night when they were\r\ndelayed by the flooded river.\r\n\r\nThe men pick up the _dooli_ and swing out of sight between the scrub\r\nclumps.\r\n\r\nThe lama raises a hand toward the rampart of the Himalayas. \xe2\x80\x9cNot with\r\nyou, O blessed among all hills, fell the Arrow of Our Lord! And never\r\nshall I breathe your airs again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou art ten times the stronger man in this good air,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kim,\r\nfor to his wearied soul appeal the well-cropped, kindly Plains. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\r\nor hereabouts, fell the Arrow, yes. We will go very softly, perhaps, a\r\n_kos_ a day, for the Search is sure. But the bag weighs heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, our Search is sure. I have come out of great temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was never more than a couple of miles a day now, and Kim\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders\r\nbore all the weight of it\xe2\x80\x94the burden of an old man, the burden of the\r\nheavy food-bag with the locked books, the load of the writings on his\r\nheart, and the details of the daily routine. He begged in the dawn, set\r\nblankets for the lama\xe2\x80\x99s meditation, held the weary head on his lap\r\nthrough the noonday heats, fanning away the flies till his wrists\r\nached, begged again in the evenings, and rubbed the lama\xe2\x80\x99s feet, who\r\nrewarded him with promise of Freedom\xe2\x80\x94today, tomorrow, or, at furthest,\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever was such a _chela_. I doubt at times whether Ananda more\r\nfaithfully nursed Our Lord. And thou art a Sahib? When I was a man\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlong time ago\xe2\x80\x94I forgot that. Now I look upon thee often, and every time\r\nI remember that thou art a Sahib. It is strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast said there is neither black nor white. Why plague me with\r\nthis talk, Holy One? Let me rub the other foot. It vexes me. I am _not_\r\na Sahib. I am thy _chela_, and my head is heavy on my shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience a little! We reach Freedom together. Then thou and I, upon\r\nthe far bank of the River, will look back upon our lives as in the\r\nHills we saw our days\xe2\x80\x99 marches laid out behind us. Perhaps I was once a\r\nSahib.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas never a Sahib like thee, I swear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House was in past\r\nlife a very wise Abbot. But even his spectacles do not make my eyes\r\nsee. There fall shadows when I would look steadily. No matter\xe2\x80\x94we know\r\nthe tricks of the poor stupid carcass\xe2\x80\x94shadow changing to another\r\nshadow. I am bound by the illusion of Time and Space. How far came we\r\ntoday in the flesh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps half a koss.\xe2\x80\x9d (Three quarters of a mile, and it was a weary\r\nmarch.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a koss. Ha! I went ten thousand thousand in the spirit. How, we\r\nare all lapped and swathed and swaddled in these senseless things.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlooked at his thin blue-veined hand that found the beads so heavy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Chela_, hast thou never a wish to leave me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim thought of the oilskin packet and the books in the food-bag. If\r\nsomeone duly authorized would only take delivery of them the Great Game\r\nmight play itself for aught he then cared. He was tired and hot in his\r\nhead, and a cough that came from the stomach worried him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d he said almost sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a dog or a snake to bite when I\r\nhave learned to love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art too tender towards me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that either. I have moved in one matter without consulting thee. I\r\nhave sent a message to the Kulu woman by that woman who gave us the\r\ngoat\xe2\x80\x99s milk this morn, saying that thou wast a little feeble and\r\nwouldst need a litter. I beat myself in my mind that I did not do it\r\nwhen we entered the Doon. We stay in this place till the litter\r\nreturns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am content. She is a woman with a heart of gold, as thou sayest, but\r\na talker\xe2\x80\x94something of a talker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not weary thee. I have looked to that also. Holy One, my\r\nheart is very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee.\xe2\x80\x9d An\r\nhysterical catch rose in his throat. \xe2\x80\x9cI have walked thee too far: I\r\nhave not picked good food always for thee; I have not considered the\r\nheat; I have talked to people on the road and left thee alone ... I\r\nhave\xe2\x80\x94I have ... _Hai mai!_ But I love thee ... and it is all too late\r\n... I was a child ... Oh, why was I not a man? ...\xe2\x80\x9d Overborne by\r\nstrain, fatigue, and the weight beyond his years, Kim broke down and\r\nsobbed at the lama\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a to-do is here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast never\r\nstepped a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth from the Way of Obedience. Neglect me? Child,\r\nI have lived on thy strength as an old tree lives on the lime of a new\r\nwall. Day by day, since Shamlegh down, I have stolen strength from\r\nthee. _Therefore_, not through any sin of thine, art thou weakened. It\r\nis the Body\xe2\x80\x94the silly, stupid Body\xe2\x80\x94that speaks now. Not the assured\r\nSoul. Be comforted! Know at least the devils that thou fightest. They\r\nare earth-born\xe2\x80\x94children of illusion. We will go to the woman from Kulu.\r\nShe shall acquire merit in housing us, and specially in tending me.\r\nThou shalt run free till strength returns. I had forgotten the stupid\r\nBody. If there be any blame, I bear it. But we are too close to the\r\nGates of Deliverance to weigh blame. I could praise thee, but what\r\nneed? In a little\xe2\x80\x94in a very little\xe2\x80\x94we shall sit beyond all needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he petted and comforted Kim with wise saws and grave texts on\r\nthat little-understood beast, our Body, who, being but a delusion,\r\ninsists on posing as the Soul, to the darkening of the Way, and the\r\nimmense multiplication of unnecessary devils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHai! hai! Let us talk of the woman from Kulu. Think you she will ask\r\nanother charm for her grandsons? When I was a young man, a very long\r\ntime ago, I was plagued with these vapours\xe2\x80\x94and some others\xe2\x80\x94and I went\r\nto an Abbot\xe2\x80\x94a very holy man and a seeker after truth, though then I\r\nknew it not. Sit up and listen, child of my soul! My tale was told.\r\nSaid he to me, \xe2\x80\x98_Chela_, know this. There are many lies in the world,\r\nand not a few liars, but there are no liars like our bodies, except it\r\nbe the sensations of our bodies.\xe2\x80\x99 Considering this I was comforted, and\r\nof his great favour he suffered me to drink tea In his presence. Suffer\r\nme now to drink tea, for I am thirsty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a laugh across his tears, Kim kissed the lama\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and set\r\nabout the tea-making.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou leanest on me in the body, Holy One, but I lean on thee for some\r\nother things. Dost know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have guessed maybe,\xe2\x80\x9d and the lama\xe2\x80\x99s eyes twinkled. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must change\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, when with scufflings and scrapings and a hot air of importance,\r\npaddled up nothing less than the Sahiba\xe2\x80\x99s pet palanquin sent twenty\r\nmiles, with that same grizzled old Oorya servant in charge, and when\r\nthey reached the disorderly order of the long white rambling house\r\nbehind Saharunpore, the lama took his own measures.\r\n\r\nSaid the Sahiba cheerily from an upper window, after compliments: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis the good of an old woman\xe2\x80\x99s advice to an old man? I told thee\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n_told_ thee, Holy One, to keep an eye upon the _chela_. How didst thou\r\ndo it? Never answer me! _I_ know. He has been running among the women.\r\nLook at his eyes\xe2\x80\x94hollow and sunk\xe2\x80\x94and the Betraying Line from the nose\r\ndown! He has been sifted out! Fie! Fie! And a priest, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim looked up, over-weary to smile, shaking his head in denial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not jest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama. \xe2\x80\x9cThat time is done. We are here upon\r\ngreat matters. A sickness of soul took me in the Hills, and him a\r\nsickness of the body. Since then I have lived upon his strength\xe2\x80\x94eating\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren together\xe2\x80\x94young and old,\xe2\x80\x9d she sniffed, but forbore to make any\r\nnew jokes. \xe2\x80\x9cMay this present hospitality restore ye! Hold awhile and I\r\nwill come to gossip of the high good Hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt evening time\xe2\x80\x94her son-in-law was returned, so she did not need to go\r\non inspection round the farm\xe2\x80\x94she won to the meat of the matter,\r\nexplained low-voicedly by the lama. The two old heads nodded wisely\r\ntogether. Kim had reeled to a room with a cot in it, and was dozing\r\nsoddenly. The lama had forbidden him to set blankets or get food.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know. Who but I?\xe2\x80\x9d she cackled. \xe2\x80\x9cWe who go down to the\r\nburning-ghats clutch at the hands of those coming up from the River of\r\nLife with full water-jars\xe2\x80\x94yes, brimming water-jars. I did the boy\r\nwrong. He lent thee his strength? It is true that the old eat the young\r\ndaily. Stands now we must restore him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast many times acquired merit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ merit. What is it? Old bag of bones making curries for men who do\r\nnot ask \xe2\x80\x98Who cooked this?\xe2\x80\x99 Now if it were stored up for my grandson\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe that had the belly-pain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think the Holy One remembers _that!_ I must tell his mother. It is\r\nmost singular honour! \xe2\x80\x98He that had the belly-pain\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94straightway the Holy\r\nOne remembered. She will be proud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy _chela_ is to me as is a son to the unenlightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay grandson, rather. Mothers have not the wisdom of our years. If a\r\nchild cries they say the heavens are falling. Now a grandmother is far\r\nenough separated from the pain of bearing and the pleasure of giving\r\nthe breast to consider whether a cry is wickedness pure or the wind.\r\nAnd since thou speakest once again of wind, when last the Holy One was\r\nhere, maybe I offended in pressing for charms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, using that form of address a Buddhist monk may\r\nsometimes employ towards a nun, \xe2\x80\x9cif charms comfort thee\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are better than ten thousand doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, if they comfort thee, I who was Abbot of Such-zen, will make as\r\nmany as thou mayest desire. I have never seen thy face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ even the monkeys who steal our loquats count for again. Hee!\r\nhee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as he who sleeps there said,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he nodded at the shut door of the\r\nguest-chamber across the forecourt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthou hast a heart of gold... And he\r\nis in the spirit my very \xe2\x80\x98grandson\xe2\x80\x99 to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! I am the Holy One\xe2\x80\x99s cow.\xe2\x80\x9d This was pure Hinduism, but the lama\r\nnever heeded. \xe2\x80\x9cI am old. I have borne sons in the body. Oh, once I\r\ncould please men! Now I can cure them.\xe2\x80\x9d He heard her armlets tinkle as\r\nthough she bared arms for action. \xe2\x80\x9cI will take over the boy and dose\r\nhim, and stuff him, and make him all whole. Hai! hai! We old people\r\nknow something yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWherefore when Kim, aching in every bone, opened his eyes, and would go\r\nto the cook-house to get his master\xe2\x80\x99s food, he found strong coercion\r\nabout him, and a veiled old figure at the door, flanked by the grizzled\r\nmanservant, who told him very precisely the things that he was on no\r\naccount to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou must have? Thou shalt have nothing. What? A locked box in which\r\nto keep holy books? Oh, that is another matter. Heavens forbid I should\r\ncome between a priest and his prayers! It shall be brought, and thou\r\nshalt keep the key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey pushed the coffer under his cot, and Kim shut away Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npistol, the oilskin packet of letters, and the locked books and\r\ndiaries, with a groan of relief. For some absurd reason their weight on\r\nhis shoulders was nothing to their weight on his poor mind. His neck\r\nached under it of nights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThine is a sickness uncommon in youth these days: since young folk\r\nhave given up tending their betters. The remedy is sleep, and certain\r\ndrugs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sahiba; and he was glad to give himself up to the\r\nblankness that half menaced and half soothed him.\r\n\r\nShe brewed drinks, in some mysterious Asiatic equivalent to the\r\nstill-room\xe2\x80\x94drenches that smelt pestilently and tasted worse. She stood\r\nover Kim till they went down, and inquired exhaustively after they had\r\ncome up. She laid a taboo upon the forecourt, and enforced it by means\r\nof an armed man. It is true he was seventy odd, that his scabbarded\r\nsword ceased at the hilt; but he represented the authority of the\r\nSahiba, and loaded wains, chattering servants, calves, dogs, hens, and\r\nthe like, fetched a wide compass by those parts. Best of all, when the\r\nbody was cleared, she cut out from the mass of poor relations that\r\ncrowded the back of the buildings\xe2\x80\x94house-hold dogs, we name them\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s widow, skilled in what Europeans, who know nothing about it,\r\ncall massage. And the two of them, laying him east and west, that the\r\nmysterious earth-currents which thrill the clay of our bodies might\r\nhelp and not hinder, took him to pieces all one long afternoon\xe2\x80\x94bone by\r\nbone, muscle by muscle, ligament by ligament, and lastly, nerve by\r\nnerve. Kneaded to irresponsible pulp, half hypnotized by the perpetual\r\nflick and readjustment of the uneasy _chudders_ that veiled their eyes,\r\nKim slid ten thousand miles into slumber\xe2\x80\x94thirty-six hours of it\xe2\x80\x94sleep\r\nthat soaked like rain after drought.\r\n\r\nThen she fed him, and the house spun to her clamour. She caused fowls\r\nto be slain; she sent for vegetables, and the sober, slow-thinking\r\ngardener, nigh as old as she, sweated for it; she took spices, and\r\nmilk, and onion, with little fish from the brooks\xe2\x80\x94anon limes for\r\nsherbets, fat quails from the pits, then chicken-livers upon a skewer,\r\nwith sliced ginger between.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen something of this world,\xe2\x80\x9d she said over the crowded trays,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand there are but two sorts of women in it\xe2\x80\x94those who take the strength\r\nout of a man and those who put it back. Once I was that one, and now I\r\nam this. Nay\xe2\x80\x94do not play the priestling with me. Mine was but a jest.\r\nIf it does not hold good now, it will when thou takest the road again.\r\nCousin,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this to the poor relation, never wearied of extolling her\r\npatroness\xe2\x80\x99s charity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che is getting a bloom on the skin of a new-curried\r\nhorse. Our work is like polishing jewels to be thrown to a\r\ndance-girl\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim sat up and smiled. The terrible weakness had dropped from him like\r\nan old shoe. His tongue itched for free speech again, and but a week\r\nback the lightest word clogged it like ashes. The pain in his neck (he\r\nmust have caught it from the lama) had gone with the heavy dengue-aches\r\nand the evil taste in the mouth. The two old women, a little, but not\r\nmuch, more careful about their veils now, clucked as merrily as the\r\nhens that had entered pecking through the open door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my Holy One?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him! Thy Holy One is well,\xe2\x80\x9d she snapped viciously. \xe2\x80\x9cThough that\r\nis none of _his_ merit. Knew I a charm to make him wise, I\xe2\x80\x99d sell my\r\njewels and buy it. To refuse good food that I cooked myself\xe2\x80\x94and go\r\nroving into the fields for two nights on an empty belly\xe2\x80\x94and to tumble\r\ninto a brook at the end of it\xe2\x80\x94call you _that_ holiness? Then, when he\r\nhas nearly broken what thou hast left of my heart with anxiety, he\r\ntells me that he has acquired merit. Oh, how like are all men! No, that\r\nwas not it\xe2\x80\x94he tells me that he is freed from all sin. _I_ could have\r\ntold him that before he wetted himself all over. He is well now\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nhappened a week ago\xe2\x80\x94but burn me such holiness! A babe of three would do\r\nbetter. Do not fret thyself for the Holy One. He keeps both eyes on\r\nthee when he is not wading our brooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not remember to have seen him. I remember that the days and\r\nnights passed like bars of white and black, opening and shutting. I was\r\nnot sick: I was but tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lethargy that comes by right some few score years later. But it is\r\ndone now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaharanee,\xe2\x80\x9d Kim began, but led by the look in her eye, changed it to\r\nthe title of plain love\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMother, I owe my life to thee. How shall I\r\nmake thanks? Ten thousand blessings upon thy house and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house be unblessed!\xe2\x80\x9d (It is impossible to give exactly the old\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s word.) \xe2\x80\x9cThank the Gods as a priest if thou wilt, but thank me,\r\nif thou carest, as a son. Heavens above! Have I shifted thee and lifted\r\nthee and slapped and twisted thy ten toes to find texts flung at my\r\nhead? Somewhere a mother must have borne thee to break her heart. What\r\nused thou to her\xe2\x80\x94son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no mother, my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cShe died, they tell me, when I\r\nwas young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hai mai!_ Then none can say I have robbed her of any right if\xe2\x80\x94when\r\nthou takest the road again and this house is but one of a thousand used\r\nfor shelter and forgotten, after an easy-flung blessing. No matter. I\r\nneed no blessings, but\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stamped her foot at the poor relation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake up the trays to the house. What is the good of stale food in the\r\nroom, O woman of ill-omen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ha\xe2\x80\x94have borne a son in my time too, but he died,\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered the\r\nbowed sister-figure behind the _chudder_. \xe2\x80\x9cThou knowest he died! I only\r\nwaited for the order to take away the tray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I that am the woman of ill-omen,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old lady penitently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe that go down to the _chattris_ (the big umbrellas above the\r\nburning-ghats where the priests take their last dues) clutch hard at\r\nthe bearers of the _chattis_ (water-jars\xe2\x80\x94young folk full of the pride\r\nof life, she meant; but the pun is clumsy). When one cannot dance in\r\nthe festival one must e\xe2\x80\x99en look out of the window, and grandmothering\r\ntakes all a woman\xe2\x80\x99s time. Thy master gives me all the charms I now\r\ndesire for my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s eldest, by reason\xe2\x80\x94is it?\xe2\x80\x94that he is wholly\r\nfree from sin. The _hakim_ is brought very low these days. He goes\r\nabout poisoning my servants for lack of their betters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _hakim_, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat very Dacca man who gave me the pill which rent me in three\r\npieces. He cast up like a strayed camel a week ago, vowing that he and\r\nthou had been blood-brothers together up Kulu-way, and feigning great\r\nanxiety for thy health. He was very thin and hungry, so I gave orders\r\nto have him stuffed too\xe2\x80\x94him and his anxiety!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would see him if he is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe eats five times a day, and lances boils for my hinds to save\r\nhimself from an apoplexy. He is so full of anxiety for thy health that\r\nhe sticks to the cook-house door and stays himself with scraps. He will\r\nkeep. We shall never get rid of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend him here, mother\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the twinkle returned to Kim\xe2\x80\x99s eye for a\r\nflash\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I will try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send him, but to chase him off is an ill turn. At least he had\r\nthe sense to fish the Holy One out of the brook; thus, as the Holy One\r\ndid _not_ say, acquiring merit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very wise _hakim_. Send him, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPriest praising priest? A miracle! If he is any friend of thine (ye\r\nsquabbled at your last meeting) I\xe2\x80\x99ll hale him here with horse-ropes\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and give him a caste-dinner afterwards, my son ... Get up and see\r\nthe world! This lying abed is the mother of seventy devils ... my son!\r\nmy son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe trotted forth to raise a typhoon off the cook-house, and almost on\r\nher shadow rolled in the Babu, robed as to the shoulders like a Roman\r\nemperor, jowled like Titus, bare-headed, with new patent-leather shoes,\r\nin highest condition of fat, exuding joy and salutations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, but I _am_ jolly glad to see you. I will\r\nkindly shut the door. It is a pity you are sick. Are you very sick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe papers\xe2\x80\x94the papers from the _kilta_. The maps and the _murasla!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe held out the key impatiently; for the present need on his soul was\r\nto get rid of the loot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right. That is correct Departmental view to take. You\r\nhave got everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that was handwritten in the _kilta_ I took. The rest I threw down\r\nthe hill.\xe2\x80\x9d He could hear the key\xe2\x80\x99s grate in the lock, the sticky pull\r\nof the slow-rending oilskin, and a quick shuffling of papers. He had\r\nbeen annoyed out of all reason by the knowledge that they lay below him\r\nthrough the sick idle days\xe2\x80\x94a burden incommunicable. For that reason the\r\nblood tingled through his body, when Hurree, skipping elephantinely,\r\nshook hands again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is fine! This is finest! Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara! you have\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha! swiped\r\nthe whole bag of tricks\xe2\x80\x94locks, stocks, and barrels. They told me it was\r\neight months\xe2\x80\x99 work gone up the spouts! By Jove, how they beat me! ...\r\nLook, here is the letter from Hil\xc3\xa1s!\xe2\x80\x9d He intoned a line or two of Court\r\nPersian, which is the language of authorized and unauthorized\r\ndiplomacy. \xe2\x80\x9cMister Rajah Sahib has just about put his foot in the\r\nholes. He will have to explain offeecially how the deuce-an\xe2\x80\x99-all he is\r\nwriting love-letters to the Czar. And they are very clever maps ... and\r\nthere is three or four Prime Ministers of these parts implicated by the\r\ncorrespondence. By Gad, sar! The British Government will change the\r\nsuccession in Hil\xc3\xa1s and Bun\xc3\xa1r, and nominate new heirs to the throne.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Trea-son most base\xe2\x80\x99 ... but you do not understand? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they in thy hands?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. It was all he cared for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust you jolly-well bet yourself they are.\xe2\x80\x9d He stowed the entire trove\r\nabout his body, as only Orientals can. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are going up to the\r\noffice, too. The old lady thinks I am permanent fixture here, but I\r\nshall go away with these straight off\xe2\x80\x94immediately. Mr Lurgan will be\r\nproud man. You are offeecially subordinate to me, but I shall embody\r\nyour name in my verbal report. It is a pity we are not allowed written\r\nreports. We Bengalis excel in thee exact science.\xe2\x80\x9d He tossed back the\r\nkey and showed the box empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. That is good. I was very tired. My Holy One was sick, too. And\r\ndid he fall into\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah yess. I am his good friend, I tell you. He was behaving very\r\nstrange when I came down after you, and I thought perhaps he might have\r\nthe papers. I followed him on his meditations, and to discuss\r\nethnological points also. You see, I am verree small person here\r\nnowadays, in comparison with all his charms. By Jove, O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, do you\r\nknow, he is afflicted with infirmity of fits. Yess, I tell you.\r\nCataleptic, too, if not also epileptic. I found him in such a state\r\nunder a tree _in articulo mortem_, and he jumped up and walked into a\r\nbrook and he was nearly drowned but for me. I pulled him out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was not there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim. \xe2\x80\x9cHe might have died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he might have died, but he is dry now, and asserts he has\r\nundergone transfiguration.\xe2\x80\x9d The Babu tapped his forehead knowingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntook notes of his statements for Royal Society\xe2\x80\x94_in posse_. You must\r\nmake haste and be quite well and come back to Simla, and I will tell\r\nyou all my tale at Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s. It was splendid. The bottoms of their\r\ntrousers were _quite_ torn, and old Nahan Rajah, he thought they were\r\nEuropean soldiers deserting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the Russians? How long were they with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne was a Frenchman. Oh, days and days and days! Now all the\r\nhill-people believe all Russians are all beggars. By Jove! they had not\r\none dam\xe2\x80\x99-thing that I did not get them. And I told the common\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94oah, _such_ tales and anecdotes!\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you at old Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhen you come up. We will have\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94a night out! It is feather in both\r\nour caps! Yess, and they gave me a certificate. That is creaming joke.\r\nYou should have seen them at the Alliance Bank identifying themselves!\r\nAnd thank Almighty God you got their papers so well! You do not laugh\r\nverree much, but you shall laugh when you are well. Now I will go\r\nstraight to the railway and get out. You shall have all sorts of\r\ncredits for your game. When do you come along? We are very proud of you\r\nthough you gave us great frights. And especially Mahbub.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Mahbub. And where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSelling horses in this vi-cinity, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Why? Speak slowly. There is a thickness in my head still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Babu looked shyly down his nose. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, I am fearful man,\r\nand I do not like responsibility. You were sick, you see, and I did not\r\nknow where deuce-an\xe2\x80\x99-all the papers were, and if so, how many. So when\r\nI had come down here I slipped in private wire to Mahbub\xe2\x80\x94he was at\r\nMeerut for races\xe2\x80\x94and I tell him how case stands. He comes up with his\r\nmen and he consorts with the lama, and then he calls me a fool, and is\r\nvery rude\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wherefore\xe2\x80\x94wherefore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what _I_ ask. I only suggest that if anyone steals the papers\r\nI should like some good strong, brave men to rob them back again. You\r\nsee, they are vitally important, and Mahbub Ali he did not know where\r\nyou were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMahbub Ali to rob the Sahiba\xe2\x80\x99s house? Thou art mad, Babu,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim\r\nwith indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted the papers. Suppose she had stole them? It was only practical\r\nsuggestion, I think. You are not pleased, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA native proverb\xe2\x80\x94unquotable\xe2\x80\x94showed the blackness of Kim\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Hurree shrugged his shoulders\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere is no accounting for thee\r\ntaste. Mahbub was angry too. He has sold horses all about here, and he\r\nsays old lady is _pukka_ (thorough) old lady and would not condescend\r\nto such ungentlemanly things. _I_ do not care. I have got the papers,\r\nand I was very glad of moral support from Mahbub. I tell you, I am\r\nfearful man, but, somehow or other, the more fearful I am the more\r\ndam\xe2\x80\x99-tight places I get into. So I was glad you came with me to Chini,\r\nand I am glad Mahbub was close by. The old lady she is sometimes very\r\nrude to me and my beautiful pills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah be merciful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim on his elbow, rejoicing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beast of\r\nwonder is a Babu! And that man walked alone\xe2\x80\x94if he did walk\xe2\x80\x94with robbed\r\nand angry foreigners!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOah, thatt was nothing, after they had done beating me; but if I lost\r\nthe papers it was pretty-jolly serious. Mahbub he nearly beat me too,\r\nand he went and consorted with the lama no end. I shall stick to\r\nethnological investigations henceforwards. Now good-bye, Mister O\xe2\x80\x99Hara.\r\nI can catch 4.25 p.m. to Umballa if I am quick. It will be good times\r\nwhen we all tell thee tale up at Mr Lurgan\xe2\x80\x99s. I shall report you\r\noffeecially better. Good-bye, my dear fallow, and when next you are\r\nunder thee emotions please do not use the Mohammedan terms with the\r\nTibetan dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands twice\xe2\x80\x94a Babu to his boot-heels\xe2\x80\x94and opened the door. With\r\nthe fall of the sunlight upon his still triumphant face he returned to\r\nthe humble Dacca quack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe robbed them,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kim, forgetting his own share in the game.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe tricked them. He lied to them like a Bengali. They give him a\r\n_chit_ (a testimonial). He makes them a mock at the risk of his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94_I_ never would have gone down to them after the pistol-shots\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen he says he is a fearful man ... And he _is_ a fearful man. I must\r\nget into the world again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first his legs bent like bad pipe-stems, and the flood and rush of\r\nthe sunlit air dazzled him. He squatted by the white wall, the mind\r\nrummaging among the incidents of the long _dooli_ journey, the lama\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweaknesses, and, now that the stimulus of talk was removed, his own\r\nself-pity, of which, like the sick, he had great store. The unnerved\r\nbrain edged away from all the outside, as a raw horse, once rowelled,\r\nsidles from the spur. It was enough, amply enough, that the spoil of\r\nthe _kilta_ was away\xe2\x80\x94off his hands\xe2\x80\x94out of his possession. He tried to\r\nthink of the lama\xe2\x80\x94to wonder why he had tumbled into a brook\xe2\x80\x94but the\r\nbigness of the world, seen between the forecourt gates, swept linked\r\nthought aside. Then he looked upon the trees and the broad fields, with\r\nthe thatched huts hidden among crops\xe2\x80\x94looked with strange eyes unable to\r\ntake up the size and proportion and use of things\xe2\x80\x94stared for a still\r\nhalf-hour. All that while he felt, though he could not put it into\r\nwords, that his soul was out of gear with its surroundings\xe2\x80\x94a cog-wheel\r\nunconnected with any machinery, just like the idle cog-wheel of a cheap\r\nBeheea sugar-crusher laid by in a corner. The breezes fanned over him,\r\nthe parrots shrieked at him, the noises of the populated house\r\nbehind\xe2\x80\x94squabbles, orders, and reproofs\xe2\x80\x94hit on dead ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Kim. I am Kim. And what is Kim?\xe2\x80\x9d His soul repeated it again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHe did not want to cry\xe2\x80\x94had never felt less like crying in his life\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nof a sudden easy, stupid tears trickled down his nose, and with an\r\nalmost audible click he felt the wheels of his being lock up anew on\r\nthe world without. Things that rode meaningless on the eyeball an\r\ninstant before slid into proper proportion. Roads were meant to be\r\nwalked upon, houses to be lived in, cattle to be driven, fields to be\r\ntilled, and men and women to be talked to. They were all real and\r\ntrue\xe2\x80\x94solidly planted upon the feet\xe2\x80\x94perfectly comprehensible\xe2\x80\x94clay of his\r\nclay, neither more nor less. He shook himself like a dog with a flea in\r\nhis ear, and rambled out of the gate. Said the Sahiba, to whom watchful\r\neyes reported this move: \xe2\x80\x9cLet him go. I have done my share. Mother\r\nEarth must do the rest. When the Holy One comes back from meditation,\r\ntell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere stood an empty bullock-cart on a little knoll half a mile away,\r\nwith a young banyan tree behind\xe2\x80\x94a look-out, as it were, above some\r\nnew-ploughed levels; and his eyelids, bathed in soft air, grew heavy as\r\nhe neared it. The ground was good clean dust\xe2\x80\x94no new herbage that,\r\nliving, is half-way to death already, but the hopeful dust that holds\r\nthe seeds of all life. He felt it between his toes, patted it with his\r\npalms, and joint by joint, sighing luxuriously, laid him down full\r\nlength along in the shadow of the wooden-pinned cart. And Mother Earth\r\nwas as faithful as the Sahiba. She breathed through him to restore the\r\npoise he had lost lying so long on a cot cut off from her good\r\ncurrents. His head lay powerless upon her breast, and his opened hands\r\nsurrendered to her strength. The many-rooted tree above him, and even\r\nthe dead manhandled wood beside, knew what he sought, as he himself did\r\nnot know. Hour upon hour he lay deeper than sleep.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, when the dust of returning kine made all the horizons\r\nsmoke, came the lama and Mahbub Ali, both afoot, walking cautiously,\r\nfor the house had told them where he had gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah! What a fool\xe2\x80\x99s trick to play in open country!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the\r\nhorse-dealer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could be shot a hundred times\xe2\x80\x94but this is not the\r\nBorder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, repeating a many-times-told tale, \xe2\x80\x9cnever was such\r\na _chela_. Temperate, kindly, wise, of ungrudging disposition, a merry\r\nheart upon the road, never forgetting, learned, truthful, courteous.\r\nGreat is his reward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the boy\xe2\x80\x94as I have said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was all those things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them\xe2\x80\x94but I have not yet found a Red Hat\xe2\x80\x99s charm for making him\r\noverly truthful. He has certainly been well nursed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahiba is a heart of gold,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe looks\r\nupon him as her son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHmph! Half Hind seems that way disposed. I only wished to see that the\r\nboy had come to no harm and was a free agent. As thou knowest, he and I\r\nwere old friends in the first days of your pilgrimage together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a bond between us.\xe2\x80\x9d The lama sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are at the end of\r\nthe pilgrimage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thanks to thee thine was not cut off for good and all a week back.\r\nI heard what the Sahiba said to thee when we bore thee up on the cot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMahbub laughed, and tugged his newly dyed beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was meditating upon other matters that tide. It was the _hakim_ from\r\nDacca broke my meditations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this was in Pushtu for decency\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthou wouldst have\r\nended thy meditations upon the sultry side of Hell\xe2\x80\x94being an unbeliever\r\nand an idolater for all thy child\xe2\x80\x99s simplicity. But now, Red Hat, what\r\nis to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis very night,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the words came slowly, vibrating with triumph\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nvery night he will be as free as I am from all taint of sin\xe2\x80\x94assured as\r\nI am, when he quits this body, of Freedom from the Wheel of Things. I\r\nhave a sign\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he laid his hand above the torn chart in his bosom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nmy time is short; but I shall have safeguarded him throughout the\r\nyears. Remember, I have reached Knowledge, as I told thee only three\r\nnights back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be true, as the Tirah priest said when I stole his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, that I am a _sufi_ (a free-thinker); for here I sit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mahbub\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cdrinking in blasphemy unthinkable ... I remember the tale.\r\nOn that, then, he goes to _Jannatu l\xe2\x80\x99Adn_ (the Gardens of Eden). But\r\nhow? Wilt thou slay him or drown him in that wonderful river from which\r\nthe Babu dragged thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was dragged from no river,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama simply. \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast\r\nforgotten what befell. I found it by Knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ay. True,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Mahbub, divided between high indignation and\r\nenormous mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the exact run of what happened. Thou\r\ndidst find it knowingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to say that I would take life is\xe2\x80\x94not a sin, but a madness simple.\r\nMy _chela_ aided me to the River. It is his right to be cleansed from\r\nsin\xe2\x80\x94with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, he needs cleansing. But afterwards, old man\xe2\x80\x94afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matter under all the Heavens? He is sure of Nibban\xe2\x80\x94enlightened\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said. I had a fear he might mount Mohammed\xe2\x80\x99s Horse and fly away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay\xe2\x80\x94he must go forth as a teacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! Now I see! That is the right gait for the colt. Certainly he must\r\ngo forth as a teacher. He is somewhat urgently needed as a scribe by\r\nthe State, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo that end he was prepared. I acquired merit in that I gave alms for\r\nhis sake. A good deed does not die. He aided me in my Search. I aided\r\nhim in his. Just is the Wheel, O horse-seller from the North. Let him\r\nbe a teacher; let him be a scribe\xe2\x80\x94what matter? He will have attained\r\nFreedom at the end. The rest is illusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matter? When I must have him with me beyond Balkh in six months!\r\nI come up with ten lame horses and three strong-backed men\xe2\x80\x94thanks to\r\nthat chicken of a Babu\xe2\x80\x94to break a sick boy by force out of an old\r\ntrot\xe2\x80\x99s house. It seems that I stand by while a young Sahib is hoisted\r\ninto Allah knows what of an idolater\xe2\x80\x99s Heaven by means of old Red Hat.\r\nAnd I am reckoned something of a player of the Game myself! But the\r\nmadman is fond of the boy; and I must be very reasonably mad too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the prayer?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama, as the rough Pushtu rumbled into\r\nthe red beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter at all; but now I understand that the boy, sure of Paradise,\r\ncan yet enter Government service, my mind is easier. I must get to my\r\nhorses. It grows dark. Do not wake him. I have no wish to hear him call\r\nthee master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he _is_ my disciple. What else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has told me.\xe2\x80\x9d Mahbub choked down his touch of spleen and rose\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not altogether of thy faith, Red Hat\xe2\x80\x94if so small a\r\nmatter concern thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought not. Therefore it will not move thee, sinless, new-washed\r\nand three parts drowned to boot, when I call thee a good man\xe2\x80\x94a very\r\ngood man. We have talked together some four or five evenings now, and\r\nfor all I am a horse-coper I can still, as the saying is, see holiness\r\nbeyond the legs of a horse. Yea, can see, too, how our Friend of all\r\nthe World put his hand in thine at the first. Use him well, and suffer\r\nhim to return to the world as a teacher, when thou hast\xe2\x80\x94bathed his\r\nlegs, if that be the proper medicine for the colt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not follow the Way thyself, and so accompany the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMahbub stared stupefied at the magnificent insolence of the demand,\r\nwhich across the Border he would have paid with more than a blow. Then\r\nthe humour of it touched his worldly soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly\xe2\x80\x94softly\xe2\x80\x94one foot at a time, as the lame gelding went over the\r\nUmballa jumps. I may come to Paradise later\xe2\x80\x94I have workings that\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94great motions\xe2\x80\x94and I owe them to thy simplicity. Thou hast never\r\nlied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat need?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Allah, hear him! \xe2\x80\x98What need\xe2\x80\x99 in this Thy world! Nor ever harmed a\r\nman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce\xe2\x80\x94with a pencase\xe2\x80\x94before I was wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo? I think the better of thee. Thy teachings are good. Thou hast\r\nturned one man that I know from the path of strife.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed\r\nimmensely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe came here open-minded to commit a _dacoity_ (a\r\nhouse-robbery with violence). Yes, to cut, rob, kill, and carry off\r\nwhat he desired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great foolishness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! black shame too. So he thought after he had seen thee\xe2\x80\x94and a few\r\nothers, male and female. So he abandoned it; and now he goes to beat a\r\nbig fat Babu man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah forbid it! Some men are strong in knowledge, Red Hat. Thy\r\nstrength is stronger still. Keep it\xe2\x80\x94I think thou wilt. If the boy be\r\nnot a good servant, pull his ears off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a hitch of his broad Bokhariot belt the Pathan swaggered off into\r\nthe gloaming, and the lama came down from his clouds so far as to look\r\nat the broad back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat person lacks courtesy, and is deceived by the shadow of\r\nappearances. But he spoke well of my _chela_, who now enters upon his\r\nreward. Let me make the prayer! ... Wake, O fortunate above all born of\r\nwomen. Wake! It is found!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKim came up from those deep wells, and the lama attended his yawning\r\npleasure; duly snapping fingers to head off evil spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have slept a hundred years. Where\xe2\x80\x94? Holy One, hast _thou_ been here\r\nlong? I went out to look for thee, but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he laughed drowsily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI slept by\r\nthe way. I am all well now. Hast thou eaten? Let us go to the house. It\r\nis many days since I tended thee. And the Sahiba fed thee well? Who\r\nshampooed thy legs? What of the weaknesses\xe2\x80\x94the belly and the neck, and\r\nthe beating in the ears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone\xe2\x80\x94all gone. Dost thou not know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing, but that I have not seen thee in a monkey\xe2\x80\x99s age. Know\r\nwhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange the knowledge did not reach out to thee, when all my thoughts\r\nwere theeward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see the face, but the voice is like a gong. Has the Sahiba\r\nmade a young man of thee by her cookery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe peered at the cross-legged figure, outlined jet-black against the\r\nlemon-coloured drift of light. So does the stone Bodhisat sit who looks\r\ndown upon the patent self-registering turnstiles of the Lahore Museum.\r\n\r\nThe lama held his peace. Except for the click of the rosary and a faint\r\n_clop-clop_ of Mahbub\xe2\x80\x99s retreating feet, the soft, smoky silence of\r\nevening in India wrapped them close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me! I bring news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut shot the long yellow hand compelling silence. Kim tucked his feet\r\nunder his robe-edge obediently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me! I bring news! The Search is finished. Comes now the Reward...\r\nThus. When we were among the Hills, I lived on thy strength till the\r\nyoung branch bowed and nigh broke. When we came out of the Hills, I was\r\ntroubled for thee and for other matters which I held in my heart. The\r\nboat of my soul lacked direction; I could not see into the Cause of\r\nThings. So I gave thee over to the virtuous woman altogether. I took no\r\nfood. I drank no water. Still I saw not the Way. They pressed food upon\r\nme and cried at my shut door. So I removed myself to a hollow under a\r\ntree. I took no food. I took no water. I sat in meditation two days and\r\ntwo nights, abstracting my mind; inbreathing and outbreathing in the\r\nrequired manner ... Upon the second night\xe2\x80\x94so great was my reward\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nwise Soul loosed itself from the silly Body and went free. This I have\r\nnever before attained, though I have stood on the threshold of it.\r\nConsider, for it is a marvel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA marvel indeed. Two days and two nights without food! Where was the\r\nSahiba?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kim under his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, my Soul went free, and, wheeling like an eagle, saw indeed that\r\nthere was no Teshoo Lama nor any other soul. As a drop draws to water,\r\nso my Soul drew near to the Great Soul which is beyond all things. At\r\nthat point, exalted in contemplation, I saw all Hind, from Ceylon in\r\nthe sea to the Hills, and my own Painted Rocks at Such-zen; I saw every\r\ncamp and village, to the least, where we have ever rested. I saw them\r\nat one time and in one place; for they were within the Soul. By this I\r\nknew the Soul had passed beyond the illusion of Time and Space and of\r\nThings. By this I knew that I was free. I saw thee lying in thy cot,\r\nand I saw thee falling downhill under the idolater\xe2\x80\x94at one time, in one\r\nplace, in my Soul, which, as I say, had touched the Great Soul. Also I\r\nsaw the stupid body of Teshoo Lama lying down, and the _hakim_ from\r\nDacca kneeled beside, shouting in its ear. Then my Soul was all alone,\r\nand I saw nothing, for I was all things, having reached the Great Soul.\r\nAnd I meditated a thousand thousand years, passionless, well aware of\r\nthe Causes of all Things. Then a voice cried: \xe2\x80\x98What shall come to the\r\nboy if thou art dead?\xe2\x80\x99 and I was shaken back and forth in myself with\r\npity for thee; and I said: \xe2\x80\x98I will return to my _chela_, lest he miss\r\nthe Way.\xe2\x80\x99 Upon this my Soul, which is the Soul of Teshoo Lama, withdrew\r\nitself from the Great Soul with strivings and yearnings and retchings\r\nand agonies not to be told. As the egg from the fish, as the fish from\r\nthe water, as the water from the cloud, as the cloud from the thick\r\nair, so put forth, so leaped out, so drew away, so fumed up the Soul of\r\nTeshoo Lama from the Great Soul. Then a voice cried: \xe2\x80\x98The River! Take\r\nheed to the River!\xe2\x80\x99 and I looked down upon all the world, which was as\r\nI had seen it before\xe2\x80\x94one in time, one in place\xe2\x80\x94and I saw plainly the\r\nRiver of the Arrow at my feet. At that hour my Soul was hampered by\r\nsome evil or other whereof I was not wholly cleansed, and it lay upon\r\nmy arms and coiled round my waist; but I put it aside, and I cast forth\r\nas an eagle in my flight for the very place of the River. I pushed\r\naside world upon world for thy sake. I saw the River below me\xe2\x80\x94the River\r\nof the Arrow\xe2\x80\x94and, descending, the waters of it closed over me; and\r\nbehold I was again in the body of Teshoo Lama, but free from sin, and\r\nthe _hakim_ from Decca bore up my head in the waters of the River. It\r\nis here! It is behind the mango-tope here\xe2\x80\x94even here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah kerim! Oh, well that the Babu was by! Wast thou very wet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I regard? I remember the _hakim_ was concerned for the body\r\nof Teshoo Lama. He haled it out of the holy water in his hands, and\r\nthere came afterwards thy horse-seller from the North with a cot and\r\nmen, and they put the body on the cot and bore it up to the Sahiba\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat said the Sahiba?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was meditating in that body, and did not hear. So thus the Search is\r\nended. For the merit that I have acquired, the River of the Arrow is\r\nhere. It broke forth at our feet, as I have said. I have found it. Son\r\nof my Soul, I have wrenched my Soul back from the Threshold of Freedom\r\nto free thee from all sin\xe2\x80\x94as I am free, and sinless! Just is the Wheel!\r\nCertain is our deliverance! Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe crossed his hands on his lap and smiled, as a man may who has won\r\nsalvation for himself and his beloved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK KIM ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2226-0.txt or 2226-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/2/2226/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
