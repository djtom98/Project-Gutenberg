Brant was\r\na senior and a "Bones" man, and so had a leading part to play in\r\nthe afternoon\'s drama.  He must get the girl and the chaperon\r\noff his hands, and be at his business.  This was "Tap Day."  It is\r\nperhaps well to explain what "Tap Day" means; there are people\r\nwho have not been at Yale or had sons or sweethearts there.\r\n\r\nIn New Haven, on the last Thursday of May, toward five in the\r\nafternoon, one becomes aware that the sea of boys which ripples\r\nalways over the little city has condensed into a river flowing\r\ninto the campus.  There the flood divides and re-divides; the\r\njunior class is separating and gathering from all directions\r\ninto a solid mass about the nucleus of a large, low-hanging oak\r\ntree inside the college fence in front of Durfee Hall.  The three\r\nsenior societies of Yale, Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and\r\nWolf\'s Head, choose to-day fifteen members each from the junior\r\nclass, the fifteen members of the outgoing senior class making\r\nthe choice.  Each senior is allotted his man of the juniors, and\r\nmust find him in the crowd at the tree and tap him on the shoulder\r\nand give him the order to go to his room.  Followed by his sponsor\r\nhe obeys and what happens at the room no one but the men of the\r\nsociety know.  With shining face the lad comes back later and is\r\nslapped on the shoulder and told, "good work, old man," cordially\r\nand whole-heartedly by every friend and acquaintance--by lads who\r\nhave "made" every honor possible, by lads who have "made" nothing,\r\njust as heartily.  For that is the spirit of Yale.\r\n\r\nOnly juniors room in Durfee Hall.  On Tap Day an outsider is lucky\r\nwho has a friend there, for a window is a proscenium box for\r\nthe play--the play which is a tragedy to all but forty-five of the\r\nthree hundred and odd juniors.  The windows of every story of the\r\ngray stone facade are crowded with a deeply interested audience;\r\ngrizzled heads of old graduates mix with flowery hats of women;\r\nevery one is watching every detail, every arrival.  In front of\r\nthe Hall is a drive, and room for perhaps a dozen carriages next\r\nthe fence--the famous fence of Yale--which rails the campus round.\r\nJust inside it, at the north-east corner, rises the tree.  People\r\nstand up in the carriages, women and men; the fence is loaded with\r\npeople, often standing, too, to see that tree.\r\n\r\nAll over the campus surges a crowd; students of the other classes,\r\nseniors who last year stood in the compact gathering at the tree\r\nand left it sore-hearted, not having been "taken"; sophomores\r\nwho will stand there next year, who already are hoping for and\r\ndreading their Tap Day; little freshmen, each one sure that he,\r\nat least, will be of the elect; and again the iron-gray heads,\r\nthe interested faces of old Yale men, and the gay spring hats\r\nlike bouquets of flowers.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, the most critical single day of the four years\'\r\ncourse at the University.  It shows to the world whether or no a boy,\r\nafter three years of college life, has in the eyes of the student\r\nbody "made good."  It is a crucial test, a heart-rending test\r\nfor a boy of twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe girl sitting in the window of Durfee understood thoroughly\r\nthe character and the chances of the day.  The seniors at the tree\r\nwear derby hats; the juniors none at all; it is easier by this sign\r\nto distinguish the classmen, and to keep track of the tapping.\r\nThe girl knew of what society was each black-hatted man who twisted\r\nthrough the bareheaded throng; in that sea of tense faces she\r\nrecognized many; she could find a familiar head almost anywhere\r\nin the mass and tell as much as an outsider might what hope was\r\nhovering over it.  She came of Yale people; Brant, her brother,\r\nwould graduate this year; she was staying at the house of a Yale\r\nprofessor; she was in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere, near the edge of the pack, was Bob Floyd, captain of\r\nthe crew, a fair, square face with quiet blue eyes, whose\r\ntranquil gaze was characteristic.  To-day it was not tranquil;\r\nit flashed anxiously here and there, and the girl smiled.  She knew\r\nas certainly as if the fifteen seniors had told her that Floyd\r\nwould be "tapped for Bones."  The crew captain and the foot-ball\r\ncaptain are almost inevitably taken for Skull and Bones.  Yet\r\nfive years before Jack Emmett, captain of the crew, had not\r\nbeen taken; only two years back Bert Connolly, captain of the\r\nfoot-ball team, had not been taken.  The girl, watching the big\r\nchap\'s unconscious face, knew well what was in his mind.  "What\r\nchance have I against all these bully fellows," he was saying\r\nto himself in his soul, "even if I do happen to be crew captain?\r\nConnolly was a mutt--couldn\'t take him--but Jack Emmett--there\r\nwasn\'t any reason to be seen for that.  And it\'s just muscles\r\nI\'ve got--I\'m not clever--I don\'t hit it off with the crowd--I\'ve\r\ndone nothing for Yale, but just for the crew.  Why the dickens\r\nshould they take me?"  But the girl knew.\r\n\r\nThe great height and refined, supercilious face of another boy\r\ntowered near--Lionel Arnold, a born litterateur, and an artist--he\r\nlooked more confident than most.  It seemed to the girl he felt\r\nsure of being taken; sure that his name and position and, more\r\nthan all, his developed, finished personality must count as much\r\n as that.  And the girl knew that in the direct, unsophisticated\r\njudgments of the judges these things did not count at all.\r\n\r\nSo she gunned over the swarm which gathered to the oak tree as\r\nbees to a hive, able to tell often what was to happen.  Even to\r\nher young eyes all these anxious, upturned faces, watching\r\nsilently with throbbing pulses for this first vital decision\r\nof their lives, was a stirring sight.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear it for the ones who aren\'t taken," she cried out,\r\nand the chaperon did not smile.\r\n\r\n"I know," she said.  "Each year I think I\'ll never come again--it\'s\r\ntoo heart-rending.  It means so much to them, and only\r\nforty-five can go away happy.  Numbers are just broken-hearted.\r\nI don\'t like it--it\'s brutal."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it\'s an incentive to the under-classmen--it holds them\r\nto the mark and gives them ambition, doesn\'t it?"  the girl\r\nargued doubtfully.\r\n\r\nThe older woman agreed.  "I suppose on the whole it\'s a good\r\ninstitution.  And it\'s wonderful what wisdom the boys show.\r\nOf course, they make mistakes, but on the whole they pick the\r\nbest men astonishingly.  So many times they hit the ones who\r\ncome to be distinguished."\r\n\r\n"But so many times they don\'t," the girl followed her words.\r\nHer father and Brant were Bones men--why was the girl arguing\r\nagainst senior societies?  "So many, Mrs.  Anderson.  Uncle Ted\'s\r\nfriend, the President of Hardrington College, was in Yale in\r\nthe \'80\'s and made no senior society; Judge Marston of the\r\nSupreme Court dined with us the other night--he didn\'t make\r\nanything; Dr.  Hamlin, who is certainly one of the great physicians\r\nof the country, wasn\'t taken.  I know a lot more.  And look at\r\nsome who\'ve made things.  Look at my cousin, Gus Vanderpool--he\r\nmade Keys twenty years ago and has never done a thing since.\r\nAnd that fat Mr.  Hough, who\'s so rich and dull--he\'s Bones."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got statistics at your fingers\' ends, haven\'t you?"  said\r\nMrs.  Anderson.  "Anybody might think you had a brother among the\r\njuniors who you weren\'t hopeful about."  She looked at the girl\r\ncuriously.  Then: "They must be about all there," she spoke,\r\nleaning out.  "A full fifty feet square of dear frightened laddies.\r\nThere\'s Brant, coming across the campus.  He looks as if he was\r\ngoing to make some one president.  I suppose he feels so.  There\'s\r\nJohnny McLean.  I hope he\'ll be taken--he\'s the nicest boy in the\r\nwhole junior class--but I\'m afraid.  He hasn\'t done anything\r\nin particular."\r\n\r\nWith that, a thrill caught the most callous of the hundreds of\r\nspectators; a stillness fixed the shifting crowd; from the tower\r\nof Battell chapel, close by, the college bell clanged the stroke\r\nof five; before it stopped striking the first two juniors\r\nwould be tapped.\r\n\r\nThe dominating, unhurried note rang, echoed, and began to\r\ndie away as they saw Brant\'s hand fall on Bob Floyd\'s shoulder.\r\nThe crew captain whirled and leaped, unseeing, through the crowd.\r\nA great shout rose; all over the campus the people surged like\r\na wind-driven wave toward the two rushing figures, and everywhere\r\nsome one cried, "Floyd has gone Bones!"  and the exciting business\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nOne looks at the smooth faces of boys of twenty and wonders what\r\nthe sculptor Life is going to make of them.  Those who have known\r\nhis work know what sharp tools are in his kit; they know the tragic\r\npossibilities as well as the happy ones of those inevitable strokes;\r\nthey shrink a bit as they look at the smooth faces of the boys\r\nand realize how that clay must be moulded in the workshop--how\r\nthe strong lines which ought to be there some day must come from\r\nthe cutting of pain and the grinding of care and the push and\r\nweight of responsibility.  Yet there is service and love, too,\r\nand happiness and the slippery bright blade of success in the\r\nkit of Life the sculptor; so they stand and watch, a bit pitifully\r\nbut hopefully, as the work begins, and cannot guide the chisel\r\nbut a little way, yet would not, if they could, stop it, for the\r\nfinished job is going to be, they trust, a man, and only the\r\nsculptor Life can make such.\r\n\r\nThe boy called Johnny McLean glanced up at the window in Durfee;\r\nhe met the girl\'s eyes, and the girl smiled back and made a gay\r\nmotion with her hand as if to say, "Keep up your pluck; you\'ll\r\nbe taken."  And wished she felt sure of it.  For, as Mrs.  Anderson\r\nhad said, he had done nothing in particular.  His marks were good,\r\nhe was a fair athlete; good at rowing, good at track work; he had\r\n"heeled" the News for a year, but had not made the board.  A gift of\r\nmusic, which bubbled without effort, had put him on the Glee Club.\r\nYet that had come to him; it was not a thing he had done; boys\r\nare critical of such distinctions.  It is said that Skull and Bones\r\naims at setting its seal above all else on character.  This boy had\r\nsailed buoyantly from term to term delighted with the honors which\r\ncame to his friends, friends with the men who carried off honors,\r\nwith the best and strongest men in his class, yet never quite\r\narriving for himself.  As the bright, anxious young face looked up\r\nat the window where the women sat, the older one thought she could\r\nread the future in it, and she sighed.  It was a face which\r\nattracted, broad-browed, clear-eyed, and honest, but not a strong\r\nface--yet.  John McLean had only made beginnings; he had accomplished\r\nnothing.  Mrs.  Anderson, out of an older experience, sighed, because\r\nshe had seen just such winning, lovable boys before, and had seen\r\nthem grow into saddened, unsuccessful men.  Yet he was full of\r\npossibility; the girl was hoping against hope that Brant and the\r\nfourteen other seniors of Skull and Bones would see it so and take\r\nhim on that promise.  She was not pretending to herself that anything\r\nbut Johnny McLean\'s fate in it was the point of this Tap Day to her.\r\nShe was very young, only twenty also, but there was a maturity in\r\nher to which the boy made an appeal.  She felt a strength which\r\nothers missed; she wanted him to find it; she wanted passionately\r\nto see him take his place where she felt he belonged, with the men\r\nwho counted.\r\n\r\nThe play was in full action.  Grave and responsible seniors worked\r\nswiftly here and there through the tight mass, searching each one\r\nhis man; every two or three minutes a man was found and felt that\r\nthrilling touch and heard the order, "Go to your room."  Each time\r\nthere was a shout of applause; each time the campus rushed in\r\na wave.  And still the three hundred stood packed, waiting--thinning\r\na little, but so little.  About thirty had been taken now,\r\nand the black senior hats were visibly fewer, but the upturned boy\r\nfaces seemed exactly the same.  Only they grew more anxious minute\r\nby minute; minute by minute they turned more nervously this way\r\nand that as the seniors worked through the mass.  And as another\r\nand another crashed from among them blind and solemn and happy\r\nwith his guardian senior close after, the ones who were left seemed\r\nto drop into deeper quiet.  And now there were only two black hats\r\nin the throng; the girl looking down saw John McLean standing\r\nstiffly, his gray eyes fixed, his face pale and set; at that\r\nmoment the two seniors found their men together.  It was all over.\r\nHe had not been taken.\r\n\r\nSlowly the two hundred and fifty odd men who had not been good\r\nenough dispersed, pluckily laughing and talking together--all\r\nof them, it is safe to say, with heavy hearts; for Tap Day\r\ncounts as much as that at Yale.\r\n\r\nJohn McLean swung across the diagonal of the campus toward\r\nWelch Hall where he lived.  He saw the girl and her chaperon\r\ncome out of Durfee; and he lingered to meet them.  Two days ago\r\nhe had met the girl here with Brant, and she had stopped and\r\nshaken hands.  It seemed to him it would help if that should\r\nhappen today.  She might say a word; anything at all to show that\r\nshe was friends all the same with a fellow who wasn\'t good enough.\r\nHe longed for that.  With a sick chaos of pain pounding at what\r\nseemed to be his lungs he met her.  Mrs.  Anderson was between\r\nthem, putting out a quick hand; the boy hardly saw her as he\r\ntook it.  He saw the girl, and the girl did not look at him.\r\nWith her head up and her brown eyes fixed on Phelps gate-way she\r\nhurried along--and did not look at him.  He could not believe\r\nit--that girl--the girl.  But she was gone; she had not looked at him.\r\nLike a shot animal he suddenly began to run.  He got to his rooms;\r\nthey were empty; Baby Thomas, his "wife," known as Archibald\r\nBabington Thomas on the catalogue, but not elsewhere, had been\r\ntaken for Scroll and Key; he was off with the others who were\r\nworth while.  This boy went into his tiny bedroom and threw\r\nhimself down with his face in his pillow and lay still.  Men\r\nand women learn--sometimes--as they grow older, how to shut\r\nthe doors against disappointments so that only the vital ones\r\ncut through, but at twenty all doors are open; the iron had come\r\ninto his soul, and the girl had given it a twist which had taken\r\nhis last ounce of courage.  He lay still a long time, enduring--all\r\nhe could manage at first.  It might have been an hour later\r\nthat he got up and went to his desk and sat down in the fading\r\nlight, his hands deep in his trousers pockets; his athletic young\r\nfigure dropped together listlessly; his eyes staring at the desk\r\nwhere had worked away so many cheerful hours.  Pictures hung\r\naround it; there was a group taken last summer of girls and boys\r\nat his home in the country, the girl was in it--he did not look\r\nat her.  His father\'s portrait stood on the desk, and a painting\r\nof his long-dead mother.  He thought to himself hotly that it was\r\ngood she was dead rather than see him shamed.  For the wound was\r\nthrobbing with a fever, and the boy had not got to a sense of\r\nproportion; his future seemed blackened.  His father\'s picture\r\nstabbed him; he was a "Bones" man--all of his family--his\r\ngrandfather, and the older brothers who had graduated four and\r\nsix years ago--all of them.  Except himself.  The girl had thought\r\nit such a disgrace that she would not look at him!  Then he grew\r\nangry.  It wasn\'t decent, to hit a man when he was down.  A woman\r\nought to be gentle--if his mother had been alive--but then he\r\nwas glad she wasn\'t.  With that a sob shook him--startled him.\r\nAngrily he stood up and glared about the place.  This wouldn\'t do;\r\nhe must pull himself together.  He walked up and down the little\r\nliving room, bright with boys\' belongings, with fraternity shields\r\nand flags and fencing foils and paddles and pictures; he walked\r\nup and down and he whistled "Dunderbeck," which somehow was in\r\nhis head.  Then he was singing it:\r\n\r\n"Oh Dunderbeck, Oh Dunderbeck, how could you be so mean\r\nAs even to have thought of such a terrible machine!\r\nFor bob-tailed rats and pussy-cats shall never more be seen;\r\nThey\'ll all be ground to sausage-meat in Dunderbeck\'s machine."\r\n\r\nThere are times when Camembert cheese is a steadying thing to\r\nthink of--or golf balls.  "Dunderbeck" answered for John McLean.\r\nIt appeared difficult to sing, however--he harked back to\r\nwhistling.  Then the clear piping broke suddenly.  He bit his\r\nlower lip and went and sat down before the desk again and turned\r\non the electric reading-lamp.  Now he had given in long enough;\r\nnow he must face the situation; now was the time to find if\r\nthere was any backbone in him to "buck up."  To fool those chaps\r\nby amounting to something.  There was good stuff in this boy that\r\nhe applied this caustic and not a salve.  His buoyant\r\nlightheartedness whispered that the fellows made mistakes;\r\nthat he was only one of many good chaps left; that Dick Harding\r\nhad a pull and Jim Stanton had an older brother--excuses came.\r\nBut the boy checked them.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the point; I didn\'t make it; I didn\'t deserve it;\r\nI\'ve been easy on myself; I\'ve got to change; so some day my\r\npeople won\'t be ashamed of me--maybe."  Slowly, painfully,\r\nhe fought his way to a tentative self-respect.  He might not\r\never be anything big, a power as his father was, but he could\r\nbe a hard worker, he could make a place.  A few days before a\r\nfamous speaker had given an address on an ethical subject at\r\nYale.  A sentence of it came to the boy\'s struggling mind.\r\n"The courage of the commonplace is greater than the courage\r\nof the crisis," the orator had said.  That was his chance--"the\r\ncourage of the commonplace."  No fireworks for him, perhaps,\r\never, but, by Jove, work and will could do a lot, and he could\r\nprove himself worthy.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not through yet, but ginger," he said out loud.  "I can do\r\nmy best anyhow and I\'ll show if I\'m not fit"--the energetic tone\r\ntrailed off--he was only a boy of twenty--"not fit to be looked\r\nat," he finished brokenly.\r\n\r\nIt came to him in a vague, comforting way that probably the best\r\ngame a man could play with his life would be to use it as a tool\r\nto do work with; to keep it at its brightest, cleanest, most\r\nefficient for the sake of the work.  This boy, of no phenomenal\r\nsort, had one marked quality--when he had made a decision he\r\nacted on it.  Tonight through the soreness of a bitter\r\ndisappointment he put his finger on the highest note of his\r\ncharacter and resolved.  All unknown to himself it was a crisis.\r\n\r\nIt was long past dinner-time, but he dashed out now and got food,\r\nand when Baby Thomas came in he found his room-mate sleepy, but\r\nquite himself; quite steady in his congratulations as well as\r\nnormal in his abuse for "keeping a decent white man awake to\r\nthis hour."\r\n\r\nThree years later the boy graduated from the Boston "Tech."\r\nAs his class poured from Huntington Hall, he saw his father\r\nwaiting for him.  He noted with pride, as he always did, the tall\r\nfigure, topped with a wonderful head--a mane of gray hair,\r\na face carved in iron, squared and cut down to the marrow of\r\nbrains and force--a man to be seen in any crowd.  With that,\r\nas his own met the keen eyes behind the spectacles, he was aware\r\nof a look which startled him.  The boy had graduated at the very\r\nhead of his class; that light in his father\'s eyes all at once\r\nmade two years of work a small thing.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you were coming, sir.  That\'s mighty nice of you,"\r\nhe said, as they walked down Boylston Street together, and his\r\nfather waited a moment and then spoke in his usual incisive tone.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have liked to miss it, Johnny," he said.  "I don\'t\r\nremember that anything in my life has ever made me as satisfied\r\nas you have to-day."\r\n\r\nWith a gasp of astonishment the young man looked at him, looked\r\naway, looked at the tops of the houses, and did not find a word\r\nanywhere.  His father had never spoken to him so; never before,\r\nperhaps, had he said anything as intimate to any of his sons.\r\nThey knew that the cold manner of the great engineer covered\r\ndepths, but they never expected to see the depths uncovered.\r\nBut here he was, talking of what he felt, of character, and\r\nhonor and effort.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve appreciated what you\'ve been doing," the even voice went on.\r\n"I talk little about personal affairs.  But I\'m not uninterested;\r\nI watch.  I was anxious about you.  You were a more uncertain\r\nquantity than Ted and Harry.  Your first three years at Yale\r\nwere not satisfactory.  I was afraid you lacked manliness.\r\nThen came--a disappointment.  It was a blow to us--to family\r\npride.  I watched you more closely, and I saw before that year\r\nended that you were taking your medicine rightly.  I wanted to\r\ntell you of my contentment, but being slow of speech I--couldn\'t.\r\nSo"--the iron face broke for a second into a whimsical grin--"so\r\nI offered you a motor.  And you wouldn\'t take it.  I knew,\r\nthough you didn\'t explain, that you feared it would interfere\r\nwith your studies.  I was right?"  Johnny nodded.  "Yes.  And your\r\nlast year at college was--was all I could wish.  I see now that\r\nyou needed a blow in the face to wake you up--and you got it.\r\nAnd you waked."  The great engineer smiled with clean pleasure.\r\n"I have had"--he hesitated--"I have had always a feeling of\r\nresponsibility to your mother for you--more than for the others.\r\nYou were so young when she died that you seem more her child.\r\nI was afraid I had not treated you well--that it was my fault\r\nif you failed."  The boy made a gesture--he could not very well\r\nspeak.  His father went on: "So when you refused the motor, when\r\nyou went into engineer\'s camp that first summer instead of going\r\nabroad, I was pleased.  Your course here has been a satisfaction,\r\nwithout a drawback--keener, certainly, because I am an engineer,\r\nand could appreciate, step by step, how well you were doing, how\r\nmuch you were giving up to do it, how much power you were gaining\r\nby that long sacrifice.  I\'ve respected you through these years of\r\ncommonplace, and I\'ve known how much more courage it meant in a\r\npleasure-loving lad such as you than it would have meant in a\r\nserious person such as I am--such as Ted and Harry are, to an\r\nextent, also."  The older man, proud and strong and reserved,\r\nturned on his son such a shining face as the boy had never seen.\r\n"That boyish failure isn\'t wiped out, Johnny, for I shall remember\r\nit as the corner-stone of your career, already built over with\r\nan honorable record.  You\'ve made good.  I congratulate you and\r\nI honor you."\r\n\r\nThe boy never knew how he got home.  He knocked his shins badly\r\non a quite visible railing and it was out of the question to\r\nsay a single word.  But if he staggered it was with an overload\r\nof happiness, and if he was speechless and blind the stricken\r\nfaculties were paralyzed with joy.  His father walked beside\r\nhim and they understood each other.  He reeled up the streets\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\nThat night there was a family dinner, and with the coffee his\r\nfather turned and ordered fresh champagne opened.\r\n\r\n"We must have a new explosion to drink to the new superintendent\r\nof the Oriel mine," he said.  Johnny looked at him surprised,\r\nand then at the others, and the faces were bright with the same\r\nlook of something which they knew and he did not.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up?"  asked Johnny.  "Who\'s the superintendent of the\r\nOriel mine?  Why do we drink to him?  What are you all grinning\r\nabout, anyway?"  The cork flew up to the ceiling, and the butler\r\npoured gold bubbles into the glasses, all but his own.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I drink to the beggar, too, whoever he is?"  asked Johnny,\r\nand moved his glass and glanced up at Mullins.  But his father was\r\nbeaming at Mullins in a most unusual way and Johnny got no wine.\r\nWith that Ted, the oldest brother, pushed back his chair and\r\nstood and lifted his glass.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll drink," he said, and bowed formally to Johnny, "to the\r\ngentleman who is covering us all with glory, to the new\r\nsuperintendent of the Oriel mine, Mr.  John Archer McLean,"\r\nand they stood and drank the toast.  Johnny, more or less dizzy,\r\nmore or less scarlet, crammed his hands in his pockets and\r\nstarted and turned redder, and brought out interrogations in\r\nthe nervous English which is acquired at our great institutions\r\nof learning.\r\n\r\n"Gosh!  are you all gone dotty?"  he asked.  And "Is this a merry\r\njape?"  And "Why, for cat\'s sake, can\'t you tell a fellow what\'s\r\nup your sleeve?"  While the family sipped champagne and regarded him.\r\n\r\n"Now, if I\'ve squirmed for you enough, I wish you\'d explain--father,\r\ntell me!" the boy begged.\r\n\r\nAnd the tale was told by the family, in chorus, without politeness,\r\ninterrupting freely.  It seemed that the president of the big mine\r\nneeded a superintendent, and wishing young blood and the latest\r\nideas had written to the head of the Mining Department in the\r\nSchool of Technology to ask if he would give him the name of the\r\nablest man in the graduating class--a man to be relied on for\r\ncharacter as much as brains, he specified, for the rough army of\r\nminers needed a general at their head almost more than a scientist.\r\nWas there such a combination to be found, he asked, in a youngster\r\nof twenty-three or twenty-four, such as would be graduating from\r\nthe "Tech"?  If possible, he wanted a very young man--he wanted the\r\nenthusiasm, he wanted the athletic tendency, he wanted the\r\nplus-strength, he wanted the unmade reputation which would look\r\nfor its making to hard work in the mine.  The letter was produced\r\nand read to the shamefaced Johnny.  "Gosh!"  he remarked at intervals\r\nand remarked practically nothing else.  There was no need.  They were\r\nso proud and so glad that it was almost too much for the boy who\r\nhad been a failure three years ago.\r\n\r\nOn the urgent insistence of every one he made a speech.  He got\r\nto his six-feet-two slowly, and his hands went into his trousers\r\npockets as usual.  "Holy mackerel," he began--"I don\'t call it\r\ndecent to knock the wind out of a man and then hold him up for\r\nremarks.  They all said in college that I talked the darnedest\r\nhash in the class, anyway.  But you will have it, will you?  I\r\nhaven\'t got anything to say, so\'s you\'d notice it, except that\r\nI\'ll be blamed if I see how this is true.  Of course I\'m keen\r\nfor it--Keen!  I should say I was!  And what makes me keenest,\r\nI believe, is that I know it\'s satisfactory to Henry McLean."\r\nHe turned his bright face to his father.  "Any little plugging\r\nI\'ve done seems like thirty cents compared to that.  You\'re all\r\npeaches to take such an interest, and I thank you a lot.  Me,\r\nthe superintendent of the Oriel mine!  Holy mackerel!"  gasped\r\nJohnny, and sat down.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of fighting in the battle of life outweighs the\r\n"beer and skittles"; as does the interest.  Johnny McLean found\r\ninterest in masses, in the drab-and-dun village on the prairie.\r\nHe found pleasure, too, and as far as he could reach he tried to\r\nshare it; buoyancy and generosity were born in him; strenuousness\r\nhe had painfully acquired, and like most converts was a fanatic\r\nabout it.  He was splendidly fit; he was the best and last output\r\n of the best institution in the country; he went at his work\r\nlike a joyful locomotive.  Yet more goes to explain what he was\r\nand what he did.  He developed a faculty for leading men.  The\r\ncold bath of failure, the fire of success had tempered the young\r\nsteel of him to an excellent quality; bright and sharp, it cut\r\ncobwebs in the Oriel mine where cobwebs had been thickening for\r\nmonths.  The boy, normal enough, quite unphenomenal, was growing\r\nstrong by virtue of his one strong quality: he did what he\r\nresolved to do.  For such a character to make a vital decision\r\nrightly is a career.  On the night of the Tap Day which had so\r\nshaken him, he had struck the key-note.  He had resolved to use\r\nhis life as if it were a tool in his hand to do work, and he\r\nhad so used it.  The habit of bigness, once caught, possesses one\r\nas quickly as the habit of drink; Johnny McLean was as unhampered\r\nby the net of smallnesses which tangle most of us as a hermit;\r\nthe freedom gave him a power which was fast making a marked man\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nThere was dissatisfaction among the miners; a strike was probable;\r\nthe popularity of the new superintendent warded it off from month\r\nto month, which counted unto him for righteousness in the mind\r\nof the president, of which Johnny himself was unaware.  Yet the\r\ncobwebs grew; there was an element not reached by, resentful of,\r\nthe atmosphere of Johnny\'s friendliness--"Terence O\'Hara\'s gang."\r\nBy the old road of music he had found his way to the hearts of\r\nmany.  There were good voices among the thousand odd workmen,\r\nand Johnny McLean could not well live without music.  He heard\r\nDennis Mulligan\'s lovely baritone and Jack Dennison\'s rolling\r\nbass, as they sang at work in the dim tunnels of the coal-mine,\r\nand it seemed quite simple to him that they and he and others\r\nshould meet when work hours were over and do some singing.\r\nSoon it was a club--then a big club; it kept men out of saloons,\r\nwhich Johnny was glad of, but had not planned.  A small kindliness\r\nseems often to be watered and fertilized by magic.  Johnny\'s\r\nmusic-club grew to be a spell to quiet wild beasts.  Yet Terence\r\nO\'Hara and his gang had a strong hold; there was storm in the air\r\nand the distant thunder was heard almost continually.\r\n\r\nJohnny, as he swung up the main street of the flat little town,\r\nthe brick school-house and the two churches at one end, many\r\nsaloons en route, and the gray rock dump and the chimneys and\r\nshaft-towers of the mine at the other, carried a ribbon of\r\nbrightness through the sordid place.  Women came to the doors to\r\nsmile at the handsome young gentleman who took his hat off as if\r\nthey were ladies; children ran by his side, and he knocked their\r\ncaps over their eyes and talked nonsense to them, and swung on\r\nwhistling.  But at night, alone in his room, he was serious.\r\nHow to keep the men patient; how to use his influence with them;\r\nhow to advise the president--for young as he was he had to do\r\nthis because of the hold he had gained on the situation; what\r\nconcessions were wise--the young face fell into grave lines as\r\nhe sat, hands deep in his pockets as usual, and considered these\r\nquestions.  Already the sculptor Life was chiselling away the\r\neasy curves with the tool of responsibility.\r\n\r\nHe thought of other things sometimes as he sat before the wood fire\r\nin his old Morris chair.  His college desk was in the corner by the\r\nwindow, and around it hung photographs ordered much as they had\r\nbeen in New Haven.  The portrait of his father on the desk, the\r\npainting of his mother, and above them, among the boys\' faces,\r\nthe group of boys and girls of whom she was one, the girl whom\r\nhe had not forgotten.  He had not seen her since that Tap Day.\r\nShe had written him soon after--an invitation for a week-end at\r\nher mother\'s camp in the woods.  But he would not go.  He sat\r\nin the big chair staring at the fire, this small room in the West,\r\nand thought about it.  No, he could not have gone to her house\r\nparty--how could he?  He had thought, poor lunatic, that there\r\nwas an unspoken word between them; that she was different to him\r\nfrom what she was to the others.  Then she had failed him at the\r\nmoment of need.  He would not be taken back half-way, with the\r\ncrowd.  He could not.  So he had civilly ignored the hand which\r\nhad held out several times, in several ways.  Hurt and proud,\r\nyet without conceit, he believed that she kept him at a distance,\r\nand would not risk coming too near, and so stayed altogether away.\r\nIt happens at times that a big, attractive, self-possessed man\r\nis secretly as shy, as fanciful, as the shyest girl--if he cares.\r\nOnce and again indeed the idea flashed into the mind of Johnny\r\nMcLean--that perhaps she had been so sorry that she did not dare\r\nlook at him.  But he flung that aside with a savage half-thought.\r\n\r\n"What rot!  It\'s probable that I was important enough for that,\r\nisn\'t it?  You fool!"  And about then he was likely to get up with\r\na spring and attack a new book on pillar and shaft versus the block\r\nsystem of mining coal.\r\n\r\nThe busy days went on, and the work grew more absorbing, the\r\natmosphere more charged with an electricity which foretold\r\ntempest.  The president knew that the personality of the young\r\nsuperintendent almost alone held the electricity in solution\r\nthat for months he and his little musical club and his large\r\npopularity had kept off the strike.  Till at last a day came\r\nin early May.\r\n\r\nWe sit at the ends of the earth and sew on buttons and play cards\r\nwhile fate wipes from existence the thing dearest to us.  Johnny\'s\r\nfather that afternoon mounted his new saddle-horse and rode\r\nthrough the afternoon lights and shadows of spring.  The girl,\r\nwho had not forgotten, either, went to a luncheon and the theatre\r\nafter.  And it was not till next morning that Brant, her brother,\r\ncalled to her, as she went upstairs after breakfast, in a voice\r\nwhich brought her running back.  He had a paper in his hand,\r\nand he held it to her.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Brant?  Something bad?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, breathing fast.  "Awful.  It\'s going to make\r\nyou feel badly, for you liked him--poor old Johnny McLean."\r\n\r\n"Johnny McLean?"  she repeated.  Brant went on.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday--a mine accident.  He went down after the entombed men.\r\nNot a chance."  Brant\'s mouth worked.  "He died--like a hero--you\r\nknow."  The girl stared.\r\n\r\n"Died?  Is Johnny McLean dead?"\r\n\r\nShe did fall down, or cry out, but then Brant knew.  Swiftly he\r\ncame up and put his big, brotherly arm around her.\r\n\r\n"Wait, my dear," he said.  "There\'s a ray of hope.  Not really\r\nhope, you know--it was certain death he went to--but yet they\r\nhaven\'t found--they don\'t know, absolutely, that he\'s dead."\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the girl was locked in her room with the paper.\r\nHis name was in large letters in the head-lines.  She read the\r\naccount over many times, with painstaking effort to understand\r\nthat this meant Johnny McLean.  That he was down there now, while\r\nshe breathed pure air.  Many times she read it, dazed.  Suddenly\r\nshe flashed to the window and threw it open and beat on the stone\r\nsill and dragged her hands across it.  Then in a turn she felt\r\nthis to be worse than useless and dropped on her knees and found\r\nout what prayer is.  She read the paper again, then, and faced\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIt was the oft-repeated, incredible story of men so accustomed to\r\ndanger that they throw away their lives in sheer carelessness.\r\nA fire down in the third level, five hundred feet underground;\r\ndelay in putting it out; shifting of responsibility of one to\r\nanother, mistakes and stupidity; then the sudden discovering\r\nthat they were all but cut off; the panic and the crowding for\r\nthe shaft, and scenes of terror and selfishness and heroism\r\ndown in the darkness and smothering smoke.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper story told how McLean, the young superintendent,\r\nhad come running down the street, bare-headed, with his light,\r\ngreat pace of an athlete.  How, just as he got there, the cage\r\nof six men, which had gone to the third level, had been drawn\r\nup after vague, wild signalling, filled with six corpses.\r\nHow, when the crowd had seen that he meant to go down, a storm\r\nof appeal had broken that he should not throw his life away;\r\nhow the very women whose husbands and sons were below had clung\r\nto him.  Then the paper told of how he had turned at the mouth\r\nof the shaft--the girl could see him standing there tall and broad,\r\nwith the light on his boyish blond head.  He had snatched a\r\npaper from his pocket and waved it at arm\'s-length so that everyone\r\ncould see.  The map of the mine.  Gallery 57, on the second level,\r\nwhere the men now below had been working, was close to gallery 9,\r\nentered from the other shaft a quarter of a mile away.  The two\r\ngalleries did not communicate, but only six feet of earth divided\r\nthem.  The men might chop through to 9 and reach the other shaft\r\nand be saved.  But the men did not know it.  He explained shortly\r\nthat he must get to them and tell them.  He would go to the second\r\nlevel and with an oxygen helmet would reach possible air before\r\nhe was caught.  Quickly, with an unhesitating decision, he talked,\r\nand his buoyancy put courage in to the stricken crowd.  With that\r\na woman\'s voice lifted.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go--don\'t ye go, darlin\'," it screamed.  "\'Tis no frinds\r\ndown there.  \'Tis Terence O\'Hara and his gang--\'tis the\r\nstrike-makers.  Don\'t be throwin\' away your sweet young life\r\nfor thim."\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed.  "That\'s all right.  Terence has a right to\r\nhis chance."  He went on rapidly.  "I want five volunteers--quick.\r\nA one-man chance isn\'t enough to take help.  Quick--five."\r\n\r\nAnd twenty men pushed to the boy to follow him into hell.\r\nSwiftly he picked five; they put on the heavy oxygen helmets;\r\nthere was a deep silence as the six stepped into the cage and\r\nMcLean rang the bell that signaled the engineer to let them down.\r\nThat was all.  They were the last rescuers to go down, and the\r\ncage had been drawn up empty.  That was all, the newspaper said.\r\nThe girl read it.  All!  And his father racing across the\r\ncontinent, to stand with the shawled women at the head of the\r\nshaft.  And she, in the far-off city, going though the motions\r\nof living.\r\n\r\nThe papers told of the crowds gathering, of the Red Cross,\r\nof the experts come to consider the situation, of the line\r\nof patient women, with shawls over their heads, waiting always,\r\nthere at the first gray light, there when night fell; the girl,\r\ngasping at her window, would have given years of her life to\r\nhave stood with those women.  The second day she read that\r\nthey had closed the mouth of the shaft; it was considered that\r\nthe one chance for life below lay in smothering the flames.\r\nWhen the girl read that, a madness came on her.  The shawled\r\nwomen felt that same madness; if the inspectors and the company\r\nofficials had insisted they could not have kept the mine closed\r\nlong--the people would have opened it by force; it was felt\r\nunendurable to seal their men below; the shaft was unsealed in\r\ntwenty-four hours.  But the smoke came out, and then the watchers\r\nrealized that a wall of flame was worse than a wall of planks\r\nand sand, and the shaft was closed again.\r\n\r\nFor days there was no news; then the first fruitless descent;\r\nthen men went down and brought up heavy shapes rolled in canvas\r\nand bore them to the women; and "each morning the Red Cross\r\npresident, lifting the curtain of the car where he slept, would\r\nsee at first light the still rows of those muffled figures\r\nwaiting in the hopeless daybreak."  Not yet had the body of the\r\nyoung superintendent been found; yet one might not hope because\r\nof that.  But when one afternoon the head-lines of the papers\r\nblazed with a huge "Rescued," she could not read it, and she knew\r\nthat she had hoped.\r\n\r\nIt was true.  Eighteen men had been brought up alive, and Johnny\r\nMcLean was one.  Johnny McLean carried out senseless, with an\r\narm broken, with a gash in his forehead done by a falling beam\r\nas he crawled to hail the rescuers--but Johnny McLean alive.\r\nHe was very ill, yet the girl had not a minute\'s doubt that\r\nhe would get well.\r\n\r\nAnd while he lay unconscious, the papers of the country rang\r\nwith the story of what he had done, and his father sitting\r\nby his bed read it, through unashamed tears, but Johnny took\r\nno interest.  Breathing satisfied him pretty well for a while.\r\nThere is no need to tell over what the papers told--how he had\r\ntaken the leadership of the demoralized band; how when he found\r\nthem cut off from the escape which he had planned he had set\r\nthem to work building a barrier across a passage where the air\r\nwas fresher; how behind this barrier they had lived for six days,\r\nby the faith and courage of Johnny McLean.  How he had kept them\r\nbusy playing games, telling stories; had taught them music and\r\nput heart into them to sing glees, down in their tomb; how he had\r\n stood guard over the pitiful supply of water which dripped from\r\nthe rock walls, and found ways of saving every drop and made\r\neach man take his turn; how when Tom Steele went mad and tried\r\nto break out of the barrier on the fifth day, it was McLean who\r\nfought him and kept him from the act which would have let in the\r\nblack damp to kill all of them; how it was the fall in the\r\nslippery darkness of that struggle which had broken his arm.\r\nThe eighteen told the story, but by bit, as the men grew strong\r\nenough to talk, and the record rounded out, of life and reason\r\nsaved by a boy who had risen out of the gray of commonplace\r\ninto the red light of heroism.  The men who came out of that\r\nburial spoke afterward of McLean as of an inspired being.\r\n\r\nAt all events the strike question was settled in that week below,\r\nand Johnny McLean held the ringleaders now in the hollow of his\r\nhand.  Terence O\'Hara opened his eyes and delivered a dictum two\r\nhours after he was carried home.  "Tell thim byes," he growled\r\nin weak jerks, "that if any wan of thim says shtrike till that\r\nMcLean child drops the hat, they\'ll fight--O\'Hara."\r\n\r\nDay after day, while the country was in an uproar of enthusiasm,\r\nJohnny lay unconscious, breathing, and doing no more.  And large\r\nengineering affairs were allowed to go and rack and ruin while\r\nHenry McLean watched his son.\r\n\r\nOn a hot morning such as comes in May, a veteran fly of the year\r\nbefore buzzed about the dim window of the sick-room and banged\r\nagainst the half-closed shutters.  Half-conscious of the sound\r\nthe boy\'s father read near it, when another sound made his pulse\r\njump.\r\n\r\n"Chase him out," came from the bed in a weak, cheerful voice.\r\n"Don\'t want any more things shut up for a spell."\r\n\r\nAn hour later the older man stood over the boy.  "Do you know\r\nyour next job, Johnny?"  he said.  "You\'ve got to get well in\r\nthree weeks.  Your triennial in New Haven is then."\r\n\r\n"Holy--mackerel!"  exploded the feeble tones.  "All right, Henry,\r\nI\'ll do it."\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the last days of June, New England is at its\r\nloveliest and it is commencement time at Yale.  Under the tall\r\nelms stretch the shady streets, alive eternally with the\r\never-new youth of ever-coming hundreds of boys.  But at\r\ncommencement the pleasant, drowsy ways take on an astonishing\r\ncharacter; it is as if the little city had gone joyfully mad.\r\nHordes of men of all ages, in startling clothes, appear in all\r\nquarters.  Under Phelps Gate-way one meets pirates with long hair,\r\nwith ear-rings, with red sashes; crossing the campus comes a band\r\nof Highlanders, in front of the New Haven House are stray\r\nDutchmen and Japanese and Punchinellos and other flotsam not\r\nexpected in a decorous town; down College Street a group of\r\nmen in gowns of white swing away through the dappled shadows.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is enchanted; it is full of greetings and reunions\r\nand new beginnings and of old friendship; with the every-day\r\nclothes the boys of old have shed responsibilities and dignities\r\nand are once more irresponsibly the boys of old.  From California\r\nand Florida, even from China and France, they come swarming into\r\nthe Puritan place, while in and out through the light-hearted\r\nkaleidoscopic crowd hurry slim youngsters in floating black gown\r\nand scholar\'s cap--the text of all this celebration, the\r\ngraduating class.  Because of them it is commencement, it is\r\nthey who step now over the threshold and carry Yale\'s honor in\r\ntheir young hands into the world.  But small attention do they get,\r\nthe graduating class, at commencement.  The classic note of their\r\ngrave youthfulness is drowned in the joyful uproar; in the clamor\r\nof a thousand greetings one does not listen to these voices which\r\nsay farewell.  From the nucleus of these busy, black-clad young\r\nfellows, the folds of their gowns billowing about light, strong\r\nfigures, the stern lines of the Oxford cap graciously at odds\r\nwith the fresh modelling of their faces--down from these lads\r\nin black, the largest class of all, taper the classes,--fewer,\r\ngrayer, as the date is older, till a placard on a tree in the\r\ncampus tells that the class of \'51, it may be, has its\r\nhead-quarters at such a place; a handful of men with white hair\r\nare lunching together--and that is a reunion.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of commencement day there is a base-ball game at\r\nYale Field.  To that the returning classes go in costume, mostly\r\nmarching out afoot, each with its band of music, through the gay,\r\ndusty street, by the side of the gay, dusty street, by the side\r\nof the gay, crowded trolley-cars loaded to the last inch of the\r\nlast step with a holiday crowd, good-natured, sympathetic, full\r\nof humor as an American crowd is always.  The men march laughing,\r\ntalking, nodding to friends in the cars, in the motors, in the\r\ncarriages which fly past them; the bands play; the houses are\r\nfaced with people come to see the show.\r\n\r\nThe amphitheatre of Yale Field is packed with more than ten\r\nthousand.  The seniors are there with their mothers and fathers,\r\ntheir pretty little sisters and their proud little brothers--the\r\nflower of the country.  One looks about and sees everywhere\r\nhigh-bred faces, strong faces, open-eyed, drinking in this\r\nextraordinary scene.  For there is nothing just like it elsewhere.\r\nAcross the field where hundreds of automobiles and carriages are\r\ndrawn close--beyond that is a gate-way, and through this, at\r\nthree o\'clock or so, comes pouring a rainbow.  A gigantic,\r\nlight-filled, motion-swept rainbow of men.  The first rays\r\nof vivid color resolve into a hundred Japanese geishas; they\r\ncome dancing, waving paper umbrellas down Yale Field; on their\r\nheels press Dutch kiddie, wooden-shod, in scarlet and white,\r\nwith wigs of peroxide hair.  Then sailors, some of them twirling\r\noars--the famous victorious crew of fifteen years back; with\r\nthese march a dozen lads from fourteen to eight, the sons of\r\nthe class, sailor-clad too; up from their midst as they reach\r\nthe centre of the field drifts a flight of blue balloons of all\r\nsizes.  Then come the men of twenty years ago stately in white\r\ngowns and mortar-boards; then the Triennials, with a class boy\r\nof two years, costumed in miniature and trundled in a go-cart\r\nby a nervous father.  The Highlanders stalk by to the skirl of\r\nbagpipes with their contingent of tall boys, the coming sons\r\nof Alma Mater.  The thirty-five-year graduates, eighty strong,\r\nthe men who are handling the nation, wear a unanimous sudden\r\ngrowth of rolling gray beard.  Class after class they come,\r\ntill over a thousand men have marched out to the music of bands,\r\ndown Yale Field and past the great circle of the seats, and\r\nhave settled in brilliant masses of color on the "bleachers."\r\nThen from across the field rise men\'s voices singing.  They\r\nsing the college songs which their fathers sang, which their\r\nsons and great-grandsons will sing.  The rhythm rolls forward\r\nsteadily in all those deep voices:\r\n\r\n"Nor time nor change can aught avail," the words come,\r\n\r\n"To break the friendships formed at Yale."\r\n\r\nThere is many a breath caught in the crowded multitude to hear\r\nthe men sing that.\r\n\r\nThen the game--and Yale wins.  The classes pour on the field in\r\na stormy sea of color, and dance quadrilles, and form long lines\r\nhand in hand which sway and cross and play fantastically in a\r\ndizzying, tremendous jubilation which fills all of Yale Field.\r\nThe people standing up to go cannot go, but stay and watch them,\r\nthese thousand children of many ages, this marvellous show of\r\nlight-heartedness and loyalty.  Till at last the costumes drift\r\ntogether in platoons and disappear slowly; and the crowd thins\r\nand the last and most stirring act of the commencement-day drama\r\nis at hand.\r\n\r\nIt has come to be an institution that after the game the old\r\ngraduates should go, class by class, to the house of the president\r\nof Yale, to renew allegiance.  It has come to be an institution\r\nthat he, standing on the steps of his house, should make a short\r\nspeech to each class.  The rainbow of men, sweeping gloriously\r\ndown the city streets with their bands, dissolves into a whirlwind\r\nat the sight of that well-known, slight, dignified figure on the\r\ndoorstep of the modest house--this is a thing which one who has\r\nseen it does not forget; the three-minute speeches, each apt to\r\nits audience, each pointed with a dart straight to the heart of\r\nclass pride and sentiment, these are a marvel.  Few men living\r\ncould come out of a such a test creditably; only this master of\r\nmen and of boys could do it as he does.  For each class goes away\r\nconfident that the president at least shares its conviction that\r\nit is the best class ever graduated.  Life might well be worth\r\nliving, it would seem, to a man who should hear every year hundreds\r\nof men\'s voices thundering his name as these men behind the class\r\nbanners.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after the disaster of the Oriel mine it was commencement\r\nday in New Haven and Johnny McLean, his broken arm in a sling,\r\na square of adhesive plaster on his forehead, was back for his\r\nTriennial.  He was mightily astonished at the greeting he got.\r\nClassmates came up to him and shook his hand and said half a\r\nsentence and stopped, with an arm around his shoulder; people\r\ntreated him in a remarkable way, as if he had done something\r\nunheard of.\r\n\r\nIt gratified him, after a fashion, yet it more than half annoyed\r\nhim.  He mentioned over and over again in protest that he had done\r\nnothing which "every one of you fellows wouldn\'t have done just\r\nthe same," but they laughed at that and stood staring in a most\r\nembarrassing way.\r\n\r\n"Gosh, Johnny McLean," Tim Erwin remarked finally, "wake up and\r\nhear the birdies sing.  Do you mean to tell me you don\'t know\r\nyou\'re the hero of the whole blamed nation?"\r\n\r\nAnd Johnny McLean turned scarlet and replied that he didn\'t think\r\nit so particularly funny to guy a man who had attended strictly\r\nto his business, and walked off.  While Erwin and the others\r\nregarded him astounded.\r\n\r\n"Well, if that isn\'t too much!"  gasped Tim.  "He actually doesn\'t know!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s likely to find out before we get through," Neddy Haines,\r\nof Denver, jerked out nasally and they laughed as if at a secret\r\nknown together.\r\n\r\nSo Johnny pursued his way through the two or three days before\r\ncommencement, absorbed in meeting friends, embarrassed at times\r\nby their manner, but taking obstinately the modest place in the\r\nclass which he had filled in college.  It did not enter his mind\r\nthat anything he had done could alter his standing with the\r\n"fellows."  Moreover, he did not spend time considering that.\r\nSo he was one of two hundred Buster Browns who marched to Yale Field\r\nin white Russian blouses with shiny blue belts, in sailor hats\r\nwith blue ribbons, and when the Triennials rushed tempestuously\r\ndown Trumbull Street in the tracks of the gray-beards of thirty-five\r\nyears before, Johnny found himself carried forward so that he\r\nstood close to the iron fence which guards the little yard from\r\nthe street.  There is always an afternoon tea at the president\'s\r\nhouse after the game, to let people see the classes make their\r\ncall on the head of the University.  The house was full of people;\r\nthe yard was filled with gay dresses and men gathered to see the\r\nparade.\r\n\r\nOn the high stone steps under the arch of the doorway stood the\r\npresident and close by him the white, light figure of a little\r\ngirl, her black hair tied with a big blue bow.  Clustered in the\r\nshadow behind them were other figures.  Johnny McLean saw the\r\nlittle maid and then his gaze was riveted on the president.\r\nIt surely was good to see him again; this man who knew how to\r\nmake them all swear by him.\r\n\r\n"What will he have to say to us," Johnny wondered.  "Something\r\nthat will please the whole bunch, I\'ll bet.  He always hits it."\r\n\r\n"Men of the class of --," the president began, in his deep,\r\ncharacteristic intonations, "I know that there is only one name\r\nyou want to hear me speak; only one thought in all the minds\r\nof your class."\r\n\r\nA hoarse murmur which a second\'s growth would have made into a\r\nwild shout started in the throats of the massed men behind the\r\nclass banner.  The president held up his hand.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute.  We want that cheer; we\'ll have it; but I\'ve got\r\na word first.  A great speaker who talked to you boys in your\r\ncollege course said a thing that came to my mind to-day.\r\n\'The courage of the commonplace,\' he said, \'is greater than the\r\ncourage of the crisis.\'"\r\n\r\nAgain that throaty, threatening growl, and again the president\'s\r\nhand went up--the boys were hard to hold.\r\n\r\n"I see a man among you whose life has added a line to that saying,\r\nwho has shown to the world that it is the courage of the commonplace\r\nwhich trains for the courage of the crisis.  And that\'s all I\'ve got\r\nto say, for the nation is saying the rest--except three times three\r\nfor the glory of the class of --, the newest name on the honor roll\r\nof Yale, McLean of the Oriel mine."\r\n\r\nIt is probably a dizzying thing to be snatched into the seventh\r\nheaven.  Johnny McLean standing, scarlet, stunned, his eyes glued\r\non the iron fence between him and the president, knew nothing\r\nexcept a whirling of his brain and an earnest prayer that he might\r\nnot make a fool of himself.  With that, even as the thunder of\r\nvoices began, he felt himself lifted, swung to men\'s shoulders,\r\ncarried forward.  And there he sat in his foolish Buster Brown\r\ncostume, with his broken arm in its sling, with the white patch\r\non his forehead, above his roaring classmates.  There he sat\r\nperspiring and ashamed, and faced the head of the University, who,\r\nit must be said, appeared not to miss the humor of the situation,\r\nfor he laughed consumedly.  And still they cheered and still his\r\nname rang again and again.  Johnny, hot and squirming under the\r\nmerry presidential eye, wondered if they were going to cheer\r\nall night.  And suddenly everything--class-mates, president,\r\nroaring voices--died away.  There was just one thing on earth.\r\nIn the doorway, in the group behind the president, a girl stood\r\nwith her head against the wall and cried as if her heart would\r\nbreak.  Cried frankly, openly, mopping away tears with a\r\nwhole-hearted pocket-handkerchief, and cried more to mop away.\r\nAs if there were no afternoon tea, no mob of Yale men in the streets,\r\nno world full of people who might, if they pleased, see those tears and\r\nunderstand.  The girl.  Herself.  Crying.  In a flash, by the\r\nlight of the happiness that was overwhelming, he found this other\r\nhappiness.  He understood.  The mad idea which had come back and back\r\nto him out there in the West, which he had put down firmly, the idea\r\nthat she had cared too much and not too little on that Tap Day four\r\nyears ago--that idea was true.  She did care.  She cared still.\r\nHe knew it without a doubt.  He sat on the men\'s shoulders in his\r\nridiculous clothes, and the heavens opened.  Then the tumult and the\r\nshouting died and they let the hero down, and to the rapid succession\r\nof strong emotions came as a relief another emotion--enthusiasm.\r\nThey were cheering the president, on the point of bursting\r\nthemselves into fragments to do it, it seemed.  There were two\r\nhundred men behind the class banner, and each one was converting\r\nwhat was convertible of his being into noise.  Johnny McLean\r\nturned to with a will and thundered into the volume of tone\r\nwhich sounded over and over the two short syllables of a name\r\nwhich to a Yale man\'s idea fits a cheer better than most.\r\nThe president stood quiet, under the heaped-up honors of a\r\nbrilliant career, smiling and steady under that delirious music\r\nof his own name rising, winged with men\'s hearts, to the skies.\r\nThen the band was playing again and they were marching off down the\r\nstreet together, this wonderful class that knew how to turn earth\r\ninto heaven for a fellow who hadn\'t done much of a stunt anyhow,\r\nthis grand, glorious, big-hearted lot of chaps who would have done\r\nmuch more in his place, every soul of them--so Johnny McLean\'s\r\nthoughts leaped in time with his steps as they marched away.\r\nAnd once or twice a terror seized him--for he was weak yet from\r\nhis illness--that he was going to make "a fool of himself."\r\nHe remembered how the girl had cried; he thought of the way the\r\nboys had loaded him with honor and affection; he heard the\r\npresident\'s voice speaking those impossible words about him--about\r\nhim--and he would have given a large sum of money at one or two\r\njunctures to bolt and get behind a locked door alone where he might\r\ncry as the girl had.  But the unsentimental hilarity all around saved\r\nhim and brought him through without a stain on his behavior.  Only he\r\ncould not bolt--he could not get a moment to himself for love or money.\r\nIt was for love he wanted it.  He must find her--he could not wait now.\r\nBut he had to wait.  He had to go into the country to dinner with\r\nthem all and be lionized and made speeches at, and made fun of, and\r\ntreated as the darling child and the pride and joy and--what was harder\r\nto bear--as the hero and the great man of the class.  All the time\r\ngrowing madder with restlessness, for who could tell if she might\r\nnot be leaving town!  A remnant of the class ahead crossed them--and\r\nthere was Brant, her brother.  Diplomacy was not for Johnny\r\nMcLean--he was much too anxious.\r\n\r\n"Brant, look here," and he drew him into a comparative corner.\r\n\r\n"Where is she?"  Brant did not pretend not to understand,\r\nbut he grinned.\r\n\r\n"At the Andersons\', of course."\r\n\r\n"Now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so."\r\n\r\n"Fellows," said Johnny McLean, "I\'m sorry, but I\'ve got to sneak.\r\nI\'m going back to town."\r\n\r\nSentences and scraps of sentences came flying at him from all over.\r\n"Hold him down"--"Chain him up"--"Going--tommy-rot--can\'t go!"\r\n"You\'ll be game for the roundup at eleven--you\'ve got to be."\r\n"Our darling boy--he\'s got to be," and more language.\r\n\r\n"All right for eleven," Johnny agreed.  "I\'ll be at head-quarters\r\nthen--but I\'m going now," and he went.\r\n\r\nHe found her in a garden, which is the best place to make love.\r\nEach place is the best.  And in some mystical manner all the doubt\r\nand unhappiness which had been gone over in labored volumes of\r\nthoughts by each alone, melted to nothing, at two or three broken\r\nsentences.  There seemed to be nothing to say, for everything was\r\nsaid in a wordless, clear mode of understanding, which lovers and\r\nsaints know.  There was little plot to it, yet there was no lack\r\nof interest.  In fact so light-footed were the swift moments in the\r\nrose-scented dark garden that Johnny McLean forgot, as others have\r\nforgotten before him, that time was.  He forgot that magnificent\r\nlot of fellows, his classmates; there was not a circumstance\r\noutside of the shadowy garden which he did not whole-heartedly\r\nforget.  Till a shock brought him to.\r\n\r\nThe town was alive with bands and cheers and shouts and marching;\r\nthe distinct noises rose and fell and fused and separated, but kept\r\ntheir distance.  When one body of sound, which unnoticed by the\r\nlovers had been growing less vague, more compact, broke all at\r\nonce into loud proximity--men marching, men shouting, men singing.\r\nThe two, hand tight in hand, started, looked at each other,\r\nlistened--and then a name came in a dozen sonorous voices,\r\nas they used to shout it in college days, across the Berkeley Oval.\r\n\r\n"McLean!  McLean!"  they called.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Johnny McLean!"  and "Come out there, oh, Johnny McLean!"\r\nThat was Baby Thomas.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, they\'ve trapped me," he said, smiling in the dark and\r\nholding the hand tighter as the swinging steps stopped in front\r\nof the house of the garden.  "Brant must have told."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve certainly found you," the girl said.  Her arms,\r\nlifted slowly, went about his neck swiftly.  "You\'re mine--but\r\nyou\'re theirs to-night.  I haven\'t a right to so much of\r\nyou even.  You\'re theirs.  Go."  And she held him.  But in a\r\nsecond she had pushed him away.  "Go," she said.  "You\'re\r\ntheirs, bless every one of them."\r\n\r\nShe was standing alone in the dark, sweet garden and there was\r\na roar in the street which meant that he had opened the door\r\nand they had seen him.  And with that there were shouts of\r\n"Put him up"--"Carry him"--"Carry the boy," and laughter and\r\nshouting and then again the measured tread of many men retreating\r\ndown the street, and men\'s voices singing together.  The girl\r\nin the dark garden stood laughing, crying, and listened.\r\n\r\n  "Mother of men!"--\r\n\r\nthe deep voices sang--\r\n\r\n  "Mother of men grown strong in giving--\r\n  Honor to him thy light have led;\r\n  Rich in the toil of thousands living,\r\n  Proud of the deeds of thousands dead!\r\n  We who have felt thy power, and known thee,\r\n  We in whose lives thy lights avail,\r\n  High, in our hearts enshrined, enthrone thee,\r\n  Mother of men, old Yale!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Courage of the Commonplace, by \r\nMary Raymond Shipman Andrews\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COURAGE OF THE COMMONPLACE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 5825.txt or 5825.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/8/2/5825/\r\n\r\nProduced by the Literary Preservation Society of Lake Mary\r\nHigh School, Lake Mary, FL.

U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
