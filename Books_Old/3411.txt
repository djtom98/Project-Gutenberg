I call it bread and scrape!\xe2\x80\x9d solemnly said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt only has butter in the little holes of it, not at the top, Miss\r\nFosbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d said, in an odd pleading kind of tone, a stout good-humoured\r\ngirl of thirteen, with face, hair, and all, a good deal like a nice\r\ncomfortable apricot in a sunny place, or a good respectable Alderney cow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be better not to grumble, Susan, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied, in\r\na low voice, a pleasant dark-eyed young lady who was making tea; but the\r\nboys at the bottom of the table neither heard nor heeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, Mary, quite contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d was Sam\xe2\x80\x99s cry, in so funny a voice, that\r\nMiss Fosbrook could only laugh; \xe2\x80\x9cis this bread and scrape the fare for a\r\nrising young family of genteel birth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d with a pathetic grimace, cried the pretty-faced though sandy-haired\r\nHenry, the next to him in age, \xe2\x80\x9cif our beloved parents knew how their\r\npoor deserted infants are treated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine large infant you are, Hal!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an infant, you\xe2\x80\x99re an infant, Miss Fosbrook is an infant\xe2\x80\x94a babby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Hal!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the more civilized Sam, clenching his fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Miss Fosbrook, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cyour brother is quite\r\nright; I am as much an infant in the eye of the law as little George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, I said I would!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Henry; \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t I, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Susan, not in the most elegant English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Martin Greville twitted us with having a girl for a governess,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Henry; \xe2\x80\x9che said it was a shame we should be taken in to think her\r\ngrown up, when she was not twenty; and I said I would find out, and now I\r\nhave done it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is quite welcome to know my age,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, the\r\ncolour rising in her cheek.  \xe2\x80\x9cI was nineteen on the last of April; but I\r\nhad rather you had asked me point blank, Henry, than tried to find out in\r\na sidelong way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry looked a little surly; and Elizabeth, a nice-looking girl, who sat\r\nnext to him and was nearest in age, said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! but that would have been\r\nso rude, Miss Fosbrook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRude, but honest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; and Susan\xe2\x80\x99s honest eyes twinkled,\r\nas much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI like that;\xe2\x80\x9d but she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe Hal\r\nmeant it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Mary, this plate is done\xe2\x80\x94more bread and\r\nbutter; d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear? not bread and gammon!\xe2\x80\x9d and he began the chant, in\r\nwhich six voices joined till it became a roar, pursuing Mary down to the\r\nlower regions:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThick butter and thin bread,\r\n    Or it shall be thrown at Mary\xe2\x80\x99s head;\r\n    Thick bread and thin butter,\r\n    Is only fit for the ducks in the gutter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth looked appealingly at Miss Fosbrook; but Miss Fosbrook was\r\nleaning back in her chair, her handkerchief up to her mouth, in fits of\r\nlaughing, seeing which, the children bawled louder and louder; and\r\nElizabeth only abstained from stopping her ears because she knew that was\r\nthe sure way to be held fast, and have it bellowed into them.\r\n\r\nLittle Annie blundered in her eagerness upon\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cThick bread and thin butter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nwhereupon there was a general outcry.  \xe2\x80\x9cNanny likes thick bread and thin\r\nbutter, let her have it!\xe2\x80\x9d and Sam, Henry, and Johnnie directed a whole\r\nbattery of their remaining crusts towards her cup, which would presently\r\nhave been upset into her lap but for Miss Fosbrook, who recovered\r\nherself, and said gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cThis must not be, Sam; I shall send you away\r\nfrom the table if you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam wanted to see whether she would, and threw the crust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam,\xe2\x80\x9d she said very decidedly, though there was a quiver in her voice,\r\nas if she were frightened.\r\n\r\nSam looked up, and did not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Fosbrook!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe were all just as bad.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t punish\r\nSam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time that Sam should show that he has the feelings of a manly\r\nboy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, looking full at him.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows that I must\r\nkeep my word, and that I have no strength to fight with him.\xe2\x80\x94Sam, go and\r\nfinish your tea on the window-seat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer clear brown eyes looked full at him as she spoke, and all the young\r\npopulation watched to see what he would do.  He hesitated a moment, then\r\ntook up his cup and plate, and sat down in the window-seat.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook breathed freely, and she had almost said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut she did not think this was the time; and collecting herself, she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cFun is all very well, and I hope we shall have plenty, but we\r\nought not to let it grow riotous; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was of a good sort\r\nwhen it was complaining of the food provided for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children were all rather subdued by what she said; some felt a little\r\ncross, and some rather ashamed; and when Mary brought back the dish\r\nreplenished with slices, no one said a word as to whether the butter were\r\nthick or thin.  The silence seemed to David a favourable occasion for\r\nrenewing the great question, \xe2\x80\x9cHow does a pig pay the rent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general giggle, and again Miss Fosbrook was as bad as any:\r\nwhile David, looking affronted, tapped the table with the handle of his\r\nspoon, and repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Davy man,\xe2\x80\x9d began Henry, first recovering.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe pig is a\r\nvery sagacious animal, especially in Hampshire, and so he smells out\r\nwherever the bags of money are sown underground, and digs them up with\r\nhis nose.  Then he swings them on his back, and gives a curl of his tail\r\nand a wink of his eye, and lays them down just before the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet; and he\xe2\x80\x99s so cunning, that not an inch will he budge till he\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nthe receipt, with a stamp upon it, on his snout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; now is that a true story?\xe2\x80\x9d cried little Annie, who was the only\r\nperson except David grave enough to speak; while Sam, exploding in the\r\nwindow, called out, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that\xe2\x80\x99s why pigs have rings in\r\ntheir noses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a lady loved a swine;\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Honey,\xe2\x80\x99 says she,\r\n    I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a silver trough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Hunks!\xe2\x80\x99 says he,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\ncontinued Hal; \xe2\x80\x9cthat shows his disinterestedness.  Oh, werry sagacious\r\nhaminals is pigs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Elizabeth, \xe2\x80\x9cto confuse the children with such\r\nnonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I know how the rent is paid?  I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Papa on\r\nrent-day hundreds of times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the pigs, Hal; did you ever see the pigs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThousands of times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBringing bags of gold?  O Hal!  Hal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d continued David, who had been digesting the startling\r\nfact, \xe2\x80\x9chow the pig swings the bag on his back? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think ours could\r\ndo it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sort made on purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMade on purpose by Mr. Henry Merrifield,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, at last able to\r\nspeak.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t believe one word, David dear; Hal is laughing at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how does a pig do it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked David, returning to the charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to know, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xe2\x80\x99s sister said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cDavy went out with the nursery children\r\nto-day, and they went to see Mary\xe2\x80\x99s sister.  Her husband is drowned\r\nbecause he was a sailor; and the _Mermaid_ went to South America; and\r\nthere are five little tiny children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the mermaid\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; the _Mermaid_ was the ship, and it was wrecked, and they have\r\nnoticing to live upon; and she takes in washing, and is such a nice\r\nwoman.  Mamma said we might take them our old winter frocks, and so David\r\nwent there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she said if she had a pig to pay the rent she should be quite\r\nhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d said David.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow could he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pig would live on her garden-stuff,\r\nher cabbage-leaves and potato-skins; and that when he was fat she would\r\nsell him, and pay the rent with the money.  Am I right, Sam? you know I\r\nam a Cockney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could not be more right if you were a Hampshire beg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack Higgins was her husband\xe2\x80\x99s name, and a famous fellow he was; he once\r\nrigged a little boat for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he sailed with Papa once, long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d added Susan; to which Sam\r\nrejoined,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore fool he to go into the merchant service and get drowned, with\r\nnothing for his widow to live upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hal, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we give her a pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do!\xe2\x80\x9d earnestly exclaimed David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll catch one,\xe2\x80\x9d broke from John and Annie at once; \xe2\x80\x9csuch lots as there\r\nare in the yard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would catch it, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam disdainfully; while Susan\r\nexplained,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; those are Papa\xe2\x80\x99s pigs.  Purday would not let you give them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was only those little geese.  I meant to\r\nmake a subscription among ourselves, and give her the pig; and won\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\nbe surprised!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the children; \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s do it all ourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got one-and-threepence, and sixpence next Saturday,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve eightpence,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve a whole shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d said David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve fourpence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnnie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not much, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, feeling in her pocket, with\r\nrather black looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody knows simple Sukey never has a farthing in her\r\npocket by any chance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I have, Sam;\xe2\x80\x9d and with an air of great triumph, Susan held up\r\nthree-halfpence, whereat all the party screamed with laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but Bessie always has lots!  She\xe2\x80\x99s as rich as a little Jew.  Come,\r\nBet, Elizabeth, Elspeth, Betsy, and Bess, what will you give?\xe2\x80\x94what have\r\nyou got?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and one hand came on her shoulder, and another on her arm but\r\nshe shook herself free, and answered rather crossly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got something else to do with my money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you little stingy avaricious crab!\xe2\x80\x9d was the outcry beginning; but\r\nMiss Fosbrook stopped it before Elizabeth had time to make the angry\r\nanswer that was rising on her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dears, you must not tease her.  Each of you has a full right to\r\nuse your own money as you may think best; and it is not right to force\r\ngifts in this manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a little affected pussy-cat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal, much annoyed; \xe2\x80\x9cI know what\r\nshe wants it for\xe2\x80\x94to buy herself a ridiculous parasol like Ida Greville,\r\nwhen she would see poor Hannah Higgins starving at her feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth bit her lip, and tossed up her head; the tears were in her\r\neyes, but she made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s as obstinate as a male when she gets\r\na thing into her head.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got without her.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve only\r\nsevenpence: worse luck that I bought ball of string yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe addition amounted to three shillings and elevenpence halfpenny: a sum\r\nwhich looked so mighty when spread out, chiefly in coppers, on the\r\nwindow-seat, that Annie and David looked on it as capable of buying any\r\namount of swine; but Sam looked rather blank at it, and gazing up and\r\ndown, said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut what does a pig cost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook, what does a pig cost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook shook her head and laughed, saying that she knew much less\r\nof pigs than they did; and Susan exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Purday in the\r\ncourt,\xe2\x80\x9d they all tumbled to the window, one upon the top of the other.\r\n\r\nThe window was a large heavily-framed sash, with a deep window-seat, and\r\na narrow ledge within the sill\xe2\x80\x94as if made on purpose, the first for the\r\nknees the second for the elbows of the gazers therefrom.\r\n\r\nAs to the view, it was into a walled kitchen court, some high chestnut\r\nand lime trees just looking over the grey roofs of the offices.  On the\r\nground lay a big black Newfoundland dog, and a couple of graceful\r\ngreyhounds, one of them gnawing a bone, cunningly watched by a\r\nkeen-looking raven, with his head on one side; while peeping out from the\r\nbars of the bottle-rack was the demure face of the sandy cat, on the\r\nwatch for either bones or sparrows.\r\n\r\nA stout, stumpy, shrewd-looking labourer, in a short round frock, high\r\nbuskins, an old wide-awake, short curly hair, and a very large nose,\r\nstood in front of the dairy door, mixing a mess of warm milk for the\r\nyoung calves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPurday!  Master Purday!\xe2\x80\x9d roared nearly the whole young population above;\r\nbut he was so intent on his mixture, that he went on as if he were deaf,\r\ntill a second explosion of \xe2\x80\x9cPurday!  Purday!  I say!\xe2\x80\x9d made him turn up\r\nhis face in an odd half-awake kind of manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPurday, what\xe2\x80\x99s the price of a pig?\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does a pig cost, Purday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99ye all holler at once for?  A body can\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word,\xe2\x80\x9d was all\r\nthe answer they got; whereupon they all started together again, and\r\nPurday went on with his mixture as if they had been so many hens\r\ncackling.\r\n\r\nThen Sam got up his breath again and called alone, \xe2\x80\x9cPurday!\xe2\x80\x9d and Hal and\r\nSusan by pats and pinches strangled the like outcry from Annie and John,\r\nso as to leave the field clear for the great question, \xe2\x80\x9cPurday, what does\r\na pig cost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than your voices up there, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Purday, making some laugh;\r\nbut Henry cried impatiently,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Purday, we really do want to know what is the price of pigs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey was high last market,\xe2\x80\x9d began Purday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care if they were high or low,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what\r\nmoney they cost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifferent pigs cost different prices,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the oracle, so\r\nsententiously, that Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders shook with laughing as she\r\nstood a little in the background of the eager heap in the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice little pig, such as you\xe2\x80\x99d give\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush, Hal, it\xe2\x80\x99s a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty sort of secret\xe2\x80\x94known to eight already, and bawled out all over\r\nthe yard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him what it\xe2\x80\x99s for; you can ask him without that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice little young pig,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9csuch as you\xe2\x80\x99d keep all the summer,\r\nand fat in the winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t for you, Purday,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear my being disappointed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the free-spoken Purday,\r\nwith a twinkle of his eye, which Hal understood so well that he burst\r\nout,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you think I can never do what I say I will; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, Purday,\r\nif we don\xe2\x80\x99t give a pig to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was screamed at, and pulled into order and silence, ere the words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHannah Higgins\xe2\x80\x9d had quite come out; and Sam repeated his question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Purday at last, \xe2\x80\x9cif pigs was reasonable, you might get a\r\nnice little one to fat, at Kattern Hill fair, somewhere about ten\r\nshillings, or maybe twelve\xe2\x80\x94sometimes more, sometimes less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen shillings!\xe2\x80\x9d  The community stood round and looked at one another at\r\nthe notion of such an awful sum; but Hal was the first to cast a ray of\r\nhope on the gloom.  \xe2\x80\x9cKattern Hill fair ain\xe2\x80\x99t till Midsummer, and perhaps\r\nGrandmamma will send us some money before that.  If anybody\xe2\x80\x99s birthday\r\nwas but coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter save it out of our allowance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it to the\r\nfair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s pocket-book declared it to be four weeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal, \xe2\x80\x9cwe three big ones have sixpence a week each,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s six shillings, leaving out stingy Bess, and the little ones\r\nthreepence, that\xe2\x80\x99s three times three is nine, and three times nine is\r\nthirty-six, that\xe2\x80\x99s three shillings, and six is nine, and very near four\r\nis fourteen.  We shall do the pig yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Hal; but if pigs are reasonable, I am afraid three times nine never\r\nyet were so much so as to make thirty-six,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\nSam whistled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-seven\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s three and twopence\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal;\r\nthen at the scream of the rest, \xe2\x80\x9cat least two and threepence.  Well, any\r\nway there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty for piggy-wiggy, and it shall be a jolly secret to\r\ndelight Hannah Higgins, and surprise Papa and Mamma: hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cbut then nobody must have any fines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and Sue must keep her money.  That will be a wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try not to have a single fine, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll not buy a single lump of sugar-candy, for I do want poor Hannah to\r\nhave her pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so will we!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the younger ones with one voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\xe2\x80\x9d added Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cI must buy Dicky\xe2\x80\x99s canary seed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I must have a queen\xe2\x80\x99s head to write to Mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! never mind that, such trumpery as your letters are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma could say them by heart before she gets them.  What does she care\r\nfor them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Annie looked very deplorable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cmammas always care for little\r\ngirls\xe2\x80\x99 letters, and you are quite right to keep a penny for your stamp\r\nfor her.\xe2\x80\x94You see, Hal, this scheme will never come to good if you\r\nsacrifice other duties to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry twirled round impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we set up a treasury, and put\r\nall in that we can properly afford, and then break it open on the day\r\nbefore the fair, and see how much we have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the children in raptures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you help, Miss Fosbrook?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to do a very little, if you will take this silver\r\nthreepenny; but I do not think it would be right for me to spare one\r\npenny more, for all I can afford is very much wanted at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we have for treasury?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal, looking round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere, in the baby-house; here\xe2\x80\x99s the Toby, let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nput it inside him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe so-called baby-house was an old-fashioned cupboard with glass doors,\r\nwhere certain tender dolls, and other curiosities, playthings too frail\r\nto be played with and the like, were ranged in good order, and never\r\ntaken out except when some one child was unwell, and had to stay in-doors\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nToby Fillpot was a present from Nurse Freeman.  It was a large mug,\r\nrepresenting a man with a red coat, black hat, and white waistcoat, very\r\nshort legs, and top-boots.  The opening of the cup was at the top of his\r\nhead, and into this was dropped all the silver and pence at present\r\nmustered, and computed to be about four shillings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Miss Fosbrook, you\xe2\x80\x99ll not be cross about fines?\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnnie,\r\nlooking coaxing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall not be cross,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not engage to let\r\nyou off any.  I think having so good a use to put your money to should\r\nmake you more careful against forfeiting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnnie disconsolately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never get fined,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hal joyfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept for running up stairs in dirty shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! there\xe2\x80\x99s no dirt now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see, what are the fines?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the list,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; and sighing, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I shall\r\nnever do it!  If Bessie only would help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fines of the Stokesley schoolroom were these for delinquencies\xe2\x80\x94each\r\nvalue a farthing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  For being dressed later than eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n  For hair not properly brushed.\r\n\r\n  For coming to lessons later than five minutes after ten.\r\n\r\n  For dirty hands.\r\n\r\n  For being turned back twice with any lesson.\r\n\r\n  For elbows on the table.\r\n\r\n  For foolish crying.\r\n\r\n  For unnecessary words in lesson-time.\r\n\r\n  For running up stairs in wet shoes.\r\n\r\n  For leaving things about.\r\n\r\nEach of these bits of misbehaviour caused the forfeit of a farthing out\r\nof the weekly allowance.  Susan looked very gloomy over them; but Hal\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Susie; we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it all without you, never fear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cI vote we have some fun in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome readers may be disposed to doubt, after this specimen, whether the\r\nyoung Merrifields could be really young ladies and gentlemen; but indeed\r\ntheir birth might make them so; for there had been Squire Merrifields at\r\nStokesley as long as Stokesley had been a parish, and those qualities of\r\nhonour and good breeding that mark the gentleman had not been wanting to\r\nthe elder members of the family.  The father of these children was a\r\ncaptain in the navy, and till within the last six years the children had\r\nlived near Plymouth; but when he inherited the estate they came thither,\r\nand David and the two little ones had been born at Stokesley.  The\r\nproperty was not large; and as Captain Merrifield was far from rich, it\r\ntook much management to give all this tribe of boys and girls a good\r\neducation, as well as plenty of bread and butter, mutton, and\r\napple-pudding.  There was very little money left to be spent upon\r\nornament, or upon pleasuring; so they were brought up to the most homely\r\ndress suited to their station, and were left entirely to the country\r\nenjoyments that spring up of themselves.  Company was seldom seen, for\r\nPapa and Mamma had little time or means for visiting; and a few morning\r\ncalls and a little dining out was all they did; which tended to make the\r\nyoung ones more shy and homely, more free and rude, more inclined to love\r\ntheir own ways and despise those of other people, than if they had seen\r\nmore of the world.  They were a happy, healthy set of children, not\r\nfaulty in essentials, but, it must be confessed, a little wild, rough and\r\nuncivil, in spite of the code of fines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. MERRIFIELD had taught her children herself, till Samuel and Henry\r\nbegan going to the Curate for a couple of hours every day, to be prepared\r\nfor school.  Lessons were always rather a scramble; so many people coming\r\nto speak to her, and so many interruptions from the nursery; and then\r\ncame a time when Mamma always was tired, and Papa used to come out and\r\nscold if the noises grew very loud indeed, and was vexed if the children\r\ngave Mamma any trouble of any kind.  Next they were told they were to\r\nhave a governess\xe2\x80\x94a sort of piece of finery which the little savages had\r\nalways despised\xe2\x80\x94and thereupon came Miss Fosbrook; but before she had been\r\na week in the house Mamma was quite ill and in her bed-room, and Papa\r\nlooked graver than he had ever done before; and Mr. Braddon, the doctor,\r\ncame very often: and at last Susan was called into Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s room, and it\r\nwas explained to her that Mamma was thought so ill, that she must go to\r\nbe under a London doctor, and would be away, she could not tell how long;\r\nso that meantime the children must all be left to Miss Fosbrook, with\r\nmany many injunctions to be good and obedient, for hearing that they were\r\ngoing on well would be poor Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s only comfort.\r\n\r\nIt was three days since Captain and Mrs. Merrifield had gone; and Miss\r\nFosbrook stood at the window, gazing at the bright young green of the\r\nhorse-chestnut trees, and thinking many various thoughts in the lull that\r\nthe children had left when they rushed out of doors.\r\n\r\nShe thought herself quite alone, and stood, sometimes smiling over the\r\nodd ways of her charges, and at what they put her in mind of, sometimes\r\ngravely thinking whether she had said or done the wisest things for them,\r\nor what their mother would have most approved.  She was just going to\r\nmove away from the window, when she saw a little figure curled up on the\r\nfloor, with her head on the window-seat.  \xe2\x80\x9cBessie, my dear, what are you\r\ndoing here?  Why are not you gone out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought they were to have a great game at whoop-hide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like whoop-hide.  Johnnie pulls the clothes off my back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I hope you are not staying in because they called you those\r\nfoolish names.  It was all in good humour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, her throat swelling.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not\r\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not; but you did not speak to give your reasons; and who could\r\ntell how good they might be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to my secrets as well as they have,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little\r\nmaiden.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook looked kindly at her, and she turned wistful eyes on the\r\nyoung governess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook, will you keep a secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want my money to buy some card-board\xe2\x80\x94and some ribbon\xe2\x80\x94and some real\r\ntrue paints.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some vermilion, but I want some real good blue.\r\nAnd then I want to make some beautiful bands with ties\xe2\x80\x94like what Papa has\r\nfor his letters\xe2\x80\x94for all Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s letters in her desk.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a bundle of\r\nPapa\xe2\x80\x99s when he was gone out to the Crimean War, and that\xe2\x80\x99s to have a\r\nfrigate on it, because of the _Calliope_\xe2\x80\x94his ship, you know; and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none bundle of dear Aunt Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s to have a rose, because I always\r\nthink her memory is like the rose in my hymn, you know; and Grandmamma,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s to have\xe2\x80\x94I think perhaps I could copy a bit of the tower of\r\nWestminster Abbey out of the print, because one sees it out of her\r\nwindow; and, oh! I thought of so many more, but you see I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it\r\nwithout a real good paint-box, and that costs three and sixpence.  Now,\r\nMiss Fosbrook, is it stingy to wish to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my dear; but you could not expect the others to understand\r\nwhat they never were told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have said something if they had not called me stingy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly was rude and hasty; but if we bear such things\r\ngood-naturedly, they become better; and they were very eager about their\r\nown plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a disagreeable thing as a pig!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Bessie.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf it had been\r\nanything nice, I should not have minded so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but, my dear, you must remember that the pig will be a more useful\r\npresent than even your pretty contrivances.  You cannot call them doing\r\ngood, as the other will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are like them!  You think I ought to spend all my money on a\r\ngreat horrid pig, when Mamma\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and the tears were in the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, my dear.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone is called on to give their\r\nall, and it is very nice and quite right for a little girl to try to make\r\na pretty present to please her mamma.  There is plenty of time before\r\nyou, and I think you will manage to have some share in the very kind\r\naction your brothers and sisters are contriving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth had not forgiven, as she should have done, the being called\r\nstingy; it rankled on her feelings far more than those who said the word\r\nunderstood; and she presently went on, \xe2\x80\x9cIf they knew ever so much, they\r\nwould only laugh at me, and call it all Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense.  Miss\r\nFosbrook, please, what is affectation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it is pretending to seem what we are not by nature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nFosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cputting on manners or feelings that do not come to us of\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall tell them they make me affected,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nlike to be quiet and do things prettily, they teaze me for being\r\naffected, and I\xe2\x80\x99m forced to be as plain and blunt as their are, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like it!  I wish I was grown up.  I wish I was Ida Greville!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause then things might be pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.  \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is so\r\nplain and ugly, and one gets so tired of it!  Is it silly to like things\r\nto be pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, far from it; that is, if we do not sacrifice better things to\r\nprettiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth looked up with a light in her dark eyes, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nFosbrook, I like you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook was very much pleased, and kissed her.\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook, may I ask one\r\nquestion?  What is your name?  Mamma said it must be Charlotte, because\r\nyou signed your letter Ch. A. Fosbrook, but your little sister\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nthat you showed us began \xe2\x80\x98My dear Bell.\xe2\x80\x99  If it is a secret, indeed I\r\nwill keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no secret at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, laughing.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is\r\nChristabel Angela.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth opened her eyes, and said it by syllables.  \xe2\x80\x9cChristabel Angela!\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a prettier name than Ida.  Does it make you very glad to have it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it for some reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bessie.  \xe2\x80\x9cMamma always says we should not be a bit\r\nhappier if our names were pretty ones; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I feel as if one\r\nwould; only the others like to make things plainer and uglier than they\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never could call your name ugly; it is such a dignified, old,\r\nrespectable name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but they call me Betty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they call me Bell, and sometimes Jelly-bag and Currant-jelly,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Fosbrook, laughing and sighing, for she would have liked to have\r\nheard those funny names again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is no good to you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we talk of good in such a matter.  I like my name\r\nbecause of the reason it was given to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why?\xe2\x80\x9d eagerly asked the little girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was born, my papa was a very young man, and he was very fond of\r\nreading poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought your papa was a doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought only ladies, and poets, and idle silly people, cared for\r\npoetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can hardly be silly if they care rightly for real poetry, Bessie,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cat least, so my papa would say.  It has been one of\r\nhis great helps.  Well, in those days he was very fond of a poem about a\r\nlady called Christabel, who was so good and sweet, that when evil came\r\nnear, it could not touch her so as to do her any harm; and so he gave his\r\nlittle daughter her name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very nice!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not envy me, my dear, for I have been a good deal laughed at\r\nfor my pretty name, and so has Papa; and I do not think he would have\r\nchosen anything so fanciful if he had been a little older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen isn\xe2\x80\x99t he\xe2\x80\x94what is it you call it\xe2\x80\x94poetical now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed he is, in a good way;\xe2\x80\x9d and as the earnest eyes looked so warmly\r\nat her, Christabel Fosbrook could not help making a friend of the little\r\nmaiden.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe has very little time to read it; for you know he is a parish\r\nsurgeon in a great parish in London, full of poor people, worse off than\r\nyou can imagine, and often very ill.  He is obliged to be always hard at\r\nwork in the narrow close streets there, and to see everything sad, and\r\ndismal, and disagreeable, that can be found; but, do you know, Bessie, he\r\nalways looks for the good and beautiful side; he looks at one person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npatience, and another person\xe2\x80\x99s kindness, and at some little child\xe2\x80\x99s love\r\nfor its mother or sister, that hinders it from being too painful for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is that poetry?  I thought poetry meant verses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerses are generally the best and most suitable way of expressing our\r\nfeelings about what is good and beautiful; but they are not always\r\npoetry, any more than the verses they sang to-night about the bread and\r\nbutter, because, you know, wanting thick butter was not exactly a\r\nbeautiful feeling.  I think the denying themselves their little\r\nindulgences for the sake of giving the poor woman a pig, is much more\r\npoetical, though nobody said a word in verse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both laughed; and Elizabeth said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what you meant about\r\nyour papa.  Susy cares for goodness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was not all I meant; but it was seeing high and noble thoughts\r\nexpressed in beautiful verses that gives him pleasure; and when he has a\r\nlittle bit of leisure, it is his great treat to open a book of that sort,\r\nand read a little bit to us, and tell us why we like it.  He says it\r\nmakes him young again, and takes him out of the dingy streets, and from\r\nall his cares as to how the bills are to be paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you like coming here?\xe2\x80\x9d was Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s home question; and Miss Fosbrook\r\nwinked away a little moisture, as she said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was glad to be growing a woman, and to be able to help about some of\r\nthose bills; and then I was glad to come into the beautiful country that\r\nPapa has so often told us about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know there was anything beautiful here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Bessie, you never lived in London!  You can\xe2\x80\x99t think how many things\r\nare beautiful to me here!  I want to be writing about them to Papa and\r\nKate all day long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie.  \xe2\x80\x9cMamma has pretty things in the drawing-room,\r\nbut she keeps them out of the way; and everything here is so dull and\r\nstupid!\xe2\x80\x9d and the little girl gave a yawn.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook understood her.  The wainscoted room in which they were\r\nsitting had been painted of a uniform creamy brown; the chairs were worn;\r\nthe table was blistered and cracked; the carpet only covered the middle\r\nof the room, and was so threadbare, that only a little red showed here\r\nand there.  All that was needful was there, but of the plainest kind; and\r\nwhere the other children only felt ease and freedom, and were the more\r\ncontented and happy for the homely good sense of all around them, this\r\nlittle girl felt a want that she scarcely understood, but which made her\r\nuncomfortable and discontented, even when she had so much to be thankful\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook moved nearer to the window.  Down below there was certainly\r\nnot much to be seen; only Pierce cleaning the knives in the knife-house,\r\nand Martha washing out her pans before the dairy-door; but that was not\r\nwhere she looked.  She turned the little half-fretful face upwards.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook there!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand talk of seeing nothing pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see nothing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not see the pale clear green of those noble horse-chestnut leaves\r\njust sprung into their full summer dress\xe2\x80\x94not in the least worn nor\r\nstained yet?  And those fine spikes of white blossom, all tending\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94up\xe2\x80\x94while the masses of those leaves fall so gracefully down, as if\r\nlifting them up, and then falling back to do them honour.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bessie\r\nsmiled, and her eye lighted up.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd see the colour against the sky\xe2\x80\x94look\r\nat the contrast of that bright light green with the blue, so very deep,\r\nof the sky\xe2\x80\x94and oh! see that train of little clouds, red with soft sunny\r\nlight, like a little soft flock of rosy lambs, if there were such things,\r\nlying across the sky. O Bessie! you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk of wanting the sight of\r\npretty things while you have that sky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie was coming closer to her, when in burst Sam and Johnnie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Bess! moping here, I declare!  I suppose you and Miss Fosbrook\r\nare telling each other all your secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just coming out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.  \xe2\x80\x9cI want to make out\r\nsomething about those noble flowers of the horse-chestnut, and why they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look whiter.  Could you gather one for me, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam was only too glad of an excuse for climbing a tree, however cheaply\r\nhe might hold one who cared for flowers; and by the time Bessie had put\r\non her lilac-spotted sun-bonnet\xe2\x80\x94a shapeless article it must be confessed,\r\nwith a huge curtain serving for a tippet, very comfortable, and no\r\ntrouble at all\xe2\x80\x94he had scrambled into the fork, and brought down a\r\nbeautiful spire of blossoms, with all the grand leaves hanging round in\r\ntheir magnificent fans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the children, standing round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you could ask Mary to spare us a jug, Susan?  If I might\r\nput it in water in the schoolroom fireplace, it would look fresh and\r\ncheerful for Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, pleased with the commission, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I will;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\naway she ran, while Miss Fosbrook examined the spike to her own great\r\nenjoyment.  \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe flowers are not really white, they\r\neach have a patch of pink or yellow on them, which gives them their\r\nsoftness.  Yes; and do you see, Bessie, they are in clusters of three,\r\nand each three has one flower with a pink spot, and two with a yellow\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very curious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie: the fretfulness was very much gone\r\nout of her tone, and she stood looking at the beautiful flower, without a\r\nword, till Susan came back, when she began to show her what Miss Fosbrook\r\nhad pointed out.  Susan smiled with her really good nature, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow funny!\xe2\x80\x9d but was more intent on telling Miss Fosbrook that she had\r\nbrought the jug, and then on hauling Elizabeth away to a game at Tom\r\nTittler\xe2\x80\x99s ground.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook said she would put away the flower and come back again; and\r\nshe settled the branch in the chimney, where it looked very graceful, and\r\nreally did enliven the room, and then walked out towards the lawn.\r\n\r\nThere was a lawn in front of the house, part of which had been formerly\r\nlevelled for a bowling-green, and was kept clear of shrubs or\r\nflower-beds.  Beyond was a smooth, rather rapid slope towards a quiet\r\nriver, beyond which there rose again a beautiful green field, crowned\r\nabove by a thick wood, ending at the top in some scraggy pine-trees, with\r\nscanty dark foliage at the top of their rude russet arms.  Fine trees\r\nstood out here and there upon the slope of the field; and Captain\r\nMerrifield\xe2\x80\x99s fine sleeked cows were licking each other, or chewing the\r\ncud, under them.\r\n\r\nThere was a white Chinese bridge, the rails all zigzags, and patterns\r\nrunning this way and that, so that it must have been very ugly and\r\nglaring before the white paint had faded so much.\r\n\r\nThe house was a respectable old stone building, rather brown and grey,\r\nand the stone somewhat disposed to peel off in flakes; the windows large\r\nsashes, set in great projecting squared stones, the tallest and biggest\r\nat the top.  It was a house of a very sober pleasant countenance, that\r\nlooked as if it had always been used to have a large family in it; and\r\nthere was a vine, with all its beauteous leaves, trained all across the\r\ngarden front, making a pleasant green summer-blind over the higher half\r\nof the drawing-room windows, that now stood open, telling of the\r\nemptiness within.\r\n\r\nChristabel stood for a few moments looking round, and thinking what a\r\nparadise of green rest this would be to her hard-worked father and\r\nanxious mother; and how she should like to see her little brothers and\r\nsisters have one free run and roll on that delicious greensward, instead\r\nof now and then walking to one of the parks as a great holiday.  Yet hers\r\nwas a very happy home, and, except her being absent from it, nothing had\r\nbefallen her to sadden her merry young spirits; so when she heard the\r\njoyous cry behind her\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on Tommy Tittler\xe2\x80\x99s ground,\r\n    Picking up gold and silver,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nshe turned about, and laughed as she saw the gold-finders stooping and\r\nclawing at the grass, with eyes cast round about them for Hal, who was\r\npursuing Susan in and out, up and down till, with screams of exultation,\r\nshe was safely across the ridge of the bowling-green, that served as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Hal turned back, Miss Fosbrook was as heedfully and warily picking\r\nup gold and silver as any of the rest of them.  He was resolved on\r\ncapturing her; but first David was such a tempting prize, with his back\r\nso very near, and so unconscious, that he must be made prisoner.  A catch\r\nat the brown-holland blouse\xe2\x80\x94a cry\xe2\x80\x94a shout of laughter, and Davy is led up\r\nbehind the standard maiden-blush rose, always serving as the prison.  And\r\nnow the tug of war rages round it, he darts here and there within his\r\nbounds, holding out his hand to any kind deliverer whose touch may set\r\nhim free; and all the others run backwards and forwards, trying to\r\ncircumvent the watchful jailor, Tom Tittler, who, in front of the\r\nrose-bush, flies instantly at whoever is only coming near his captive.\r\n\r\nHa!  Susan had nearly\xe2\x80\x94all but done it, while Hal was chasing away Annie.\r\nNo, not she; Hal is back again, and with a shriek away she scours.  Sam!\r\noh, he is very near; if that stupid little Davy would only look round, he\r\nwould be free in another moment; but he only gapes at the pursuit of\r\nSusan, and Sam will touch him without his being aware!  No\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s Hal\r\nback again.  Sam\xe2\x80\x99s off.  What a scamper!  Now\xe2\x80\x99s the time\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s Miss\r\nFosbrook, lighter-footed than any of the children, softly stealing on\r\ntip-toe, while Hal is scaring Johnnie.  Her fingers just touch Davy\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreed!  Freed!\xe2\x80\x9d is the cry; and off goes he, pounding for home! but Hal\r\nrushes across the path, he intercepts Miss Fosbrook, and, with a shout of\r\ntriumph\xe2\x80\x94There is the sound of a rent.  Everybody stands a little aghast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only the gathers,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Fosbrook good-humouredly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tuck\r\nthem up and sew them in by and by; but really, Hal, you need not pull so\r\nfuriously; I would have yielded to something short of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGowns are such stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal, really meaning it for an apology,\r\nthough it did not sound like one, for her good-natured face abashed him a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouch and take used to be our rule,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\nBessie eagerly said that would be the best way, the boys were so rude;\r\nbut all the rest with one voice cried out that it would be very stupid;\r\nand Miss Fosbrook did not press it, but only begged in a droll way that\r\nsome one would take pity on her; and come to release her; and so alert\r\nwas she in skipping towards her allies from behind the rose-bush, that\r\nBessie presently succeeded in giving the rescuing touch, and she flew\r\nback quick as a bird to the safe territory, dragging Bessie with her, who\r\notherwise would have assuredly been caught; and who, warm with the spirit\r\nof the game, felt as if she should have been quite glad to be made\r\nprisoner for her dear Christabel\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nAn hour after, and all the children were in bed.  Susan and Annie\r\nagreeing that a governess was no such great bother after all; and\r\nElizabeth lying awake to whisper over to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cChristabel Angela,\r\nChristabel Angela!  That\xe2\x80\x99s my secret!\xe2\x80\x9d in a sort of dream of pleasure\r\nthat will make most people decide on her being a very silly little girl.\r\n\r\nAnd Christabel Angela herself sat mending her gathers, and thinking over\r\nher first week of far greater difficulties than she had contemplated when\r\nshe had left home with the understanding that she was to be entirely\r\nunder Mrs. Merrifield\xe2\x80\x99s direction.  Poor Mrs. Merrifield had said much of\r\nregret at leaving her to such a crew of little savages, and she had only\r\ntried to set the mother\xe2\x80\x99s mind at rest by being cheerful; and though she\r\nfelt that it was a great undertaking to manage those great boys out of\r\nlesson-hours, she knew that when a thing cannot be helped, strength and\r\naid is given to those who seek for it sincerely.\r\n\r\nAnd on the whole, she felt thankful to the children for having behaved\r\neven as well as they had done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGRANT to us, Thy humble servants, that by Thy holy inspiration we may\r\nthink those things that be good, and by Thy merciful guiding may perform\r\nthe same,\xe2\x80\x9d spelt out David with some trouble and difficulty, as he stood\r\nby Miss Fosbrook on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother \xe2\x80\x9cWell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs wanting to buy a pig one of the \xe2\x80\x98things that be good\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything kind and right is good, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, a little\r\nvexed at a sort of snorting she heard from the other end of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavy thinks the pig is in his Collect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those who were especially proud of being downright, and in\r\nhim it often amounted to utter regardlessness of people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, yet\r\nnot out of ill-nature; and when Susan responded, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t teaze Davy\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear it,\xe2\x80\x9d he was silent; but the mischief was done; and when Miss\r\nFosbrook went on saying that the wish to help the poor woman was\r\nassuredly a good thought, which the little boy might well ask to be aided\r\nin fulfilling, David had grown ashamed, and would not listen.  But the\r\nmention of the pig had set off Master Henry, who was sitting up in the\r\nwindow-seat with Annie, also learning the Collect, and he burst out into\r\ndescriptions of the weight of money that would be found in Toby, and how\r\nhe meant to go to the fair with Purday, and help him to choose the pig,\r\nand drive it home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore likely to hinder,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, Papa wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let you,\xe2\x80\x9d added Bessie; but Hal did not choose to\r\nhear, and went on as to how the pig should ran away with Purday, and jump\r\ninto a stall full of parliament gingerbread (whereat Annie fell into\r\nconvulsions of laughing), and Hal should be the first to stop it, and\r\njump on its back, and ride out of the fair holding it by the ears; and\r\nthen they should pop it into the sty unknown to Hannah Higgins, and all\r\nlie in wait to hear what would happen; and when it squealed, she would\r\nthink it the baby crying; but there Susan burst out at the notion of any\r\none thinking a child could scream like a pig, taking it as an affront to\r\nall babyhood; and Miss Fosbrook took the opportunity of saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better hatch your chickens before you count them, Henry? If\r\nyou prevent everyone from learning the Collect, I fear there will be the\r\nless hope of Mr. Piggy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! we don\xe2\x80\x99t have fines on Sundays,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma says that on Sundays naughtiness is not such a trifle that we can\r\nbe fined for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not naughtiness we are ever fined for,\xe2\x80\x9d added Elizabeth: \xe2\x80\x9c_that_\r\nwe are punished and talked to for: but the fines are only for bad\r\nhabits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  I hope I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t have any this week,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure of them for everything possible\r\nexcept crying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Bessie gets all the crying fines,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal; \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave lots, because she won\xe2\x80\x99t help the pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie started up from her place and rushed out of the room; while Miss\r\nFosbrook indignantly exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, boys, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how you can be so ill-natured!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked up as though it were quite a new light to them; and Susan\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Fosbrook! they don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it: Sam and Hal never were\r\nill-natured in their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you call ill-natured,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cunless it\r\nis saying the very things most likely to vex another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to vex anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, \xe2\x80\x9conly we always go on so, and\r\nnobody is such a baby as to mind, except Bessie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Sam muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t be always picking one\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to argue about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is time\r\nto get ready for church.  Only I thought manliness was shown in kindness\r\nto the weak, and avoiding what can pain them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went away; and Susan was the first to exclaim,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99d have been so cross!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff, Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not being cross.  I like her for having a\r\nspirit; but one can\xe2\x80\x99t be finikin and mealy-mouthed to suit her London\r\nmanners.  I like the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would have been well if any one had been by to tell Mr. Samuel that\r\ntruth of character does not consist in disagreeable and uncalled-for\r\npersonalities.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook did not wonder at little Elizabeth for her discomfort under\r\nthe rude homeliness of Stokesley, where the children made a bad copy of\r\ntheir father\xe2\x80\x99s sailor bluntness, and the difficulties of money matters\r\nkept down all indulgences.  She knew that Captain Merrifield was as poor\r\na man for an esquire as her father was for a surgeon, and that if he were\r\nto give his sons an education fit for their station, he must make his\r\nhousehold live plainly in every way; but without thinking them right\r\nfeelings, she had some pity for little Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s weariness and discontent\r\nin never seeing anything pretty.  The three girls came in dressed for\r\nchurch, in the plainest brown hats, black capes, and drab alpaca frocks,\r\nrather long and not very full; not a coloured bow nor handkerchief, not a\r\nflounce nor fringe, to relieve them; even their books plain brown.\r\nBessie looked wistfully at Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s pretty Church-service, and\r\nsaid she and Susan both had beautiful Prayer-Books, but Mamma said they\r\ncould not be trusted with them yet\xe2\x80\x94Ida Greville had such a beauty.\r\n\r\nWas it the effect of Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s words, that Sam forbore to teaze\r\nBessie about Ida Greville?\xe2\x80\x94whose name was a very dangerous subject in the\r\nschoolroom.  Also, he let Bessie take hold of Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s hand in\r\npeace, though in general the least token of affection was scouted by the\r\nwhole party.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty walk to church, over a paddock, where the cows were\r\nturned out, and then along a green lane; and the boys had been trained\r\nenough in Sunday habits to make them steady and quiet on the way,\r\nespecially as Henry was romancing about the pig.\r\n\r\nBy and by Elizabeth gave Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s hand a sudden pull; and she\r\nperceived, in the village street into which they were emerging, a party\r\non the way to church.  There were two ladies, one in stately handsome\r\nslight mourning, the other more quietly dressed, and two or three boys;\r\nbut what Elizabeth wanted her to look at was a little girl of nine years\r\nold, who was walking beside the lady.  Her hat was black chip, edged and\r\ntied with rose-coloured ribbon, and adorned with a real bird, with glass\r\neyes, black plumage, except the red crest and wings.  She wore a\r\nneatly-fitting little fringed black polka, beneath which spread out in\r\nfan-like folds her flounced pink muslin, coming a little below her knees,\r\nand showing her worked drawers, which soon gave place to her neat\r\nstockings and dainty little boots.  She held a small white parasol,\r\nbordered with pink, and deeply fringed, over her head, and held a\r\ngold-clasped Prayer-Book in her hand; and Miss Fosbrook heard a little\r\nsigh, which told her that this was the being whom Elizabeth Merrifield\r\nthought the happiest in the world.  She hoped it was not all for the fine\r\nclothes; and Sam muttered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a little figure of fun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin and Osmond Greville went daily to Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s, like Sam and Hal,\r\nso the boys ran on to them; and Mrs. Greville, turning round, showed a\r\nvery pleasant face as she bowed to Miss Fosbrook, and shaking hands with\r\nSusan and Elizabeth, asked with much solicitude after their mamma, and\r\nhow lately they had heard of her.\r\n\r\nSusan was too simple and straightforward to be shy, and answered readily,\r\nthat they had had letters, and Mamma had been sadly tired by the journey,\r\nbut was better the next day.  The little girls shook hands; and Mrs.\r\nGreville made a kind of introduction by nodding towards her companion,\r\nand murmuring something about \xe2\x80\x9cFr\xc3\xa4ulein Munsterthal;\xe2\x80\x9d and Miss Fosbrook\r\nfound herself walking beside a lady with the least of all bonnets, a\r\nprofusion of fair hair, and a good-humoured, one-coloured face, no doubt\r\nMiss Ida\xe2\x80\x99s German governess.  She said something about the fine day, and\r\nreceived an answer, but what it was she could not guess, whether German,\r\nFrench, or English, and her own knowledge of the two first languages was\r\nbetter for reading than for speaking; so after an awkward attempt or two,\r\nshe held her peace and looked at her companions.\r\n\r\nSusan and Mrs. Greville seemed to be getting on very well together; but\r\nElizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s admiration of Ida seemed to be speechless, for they were\r\nwalking side by side without a word, perhaps too close to their elders to\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\nAnnie and David were going on steadily hand in hand a little way off; and\r\nMiss Fosbrook chiefly heard the talk of the boys, who had fallen behind;\r\nperhaps her ears were quickened by its personality, for though Sam was\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, she\xe2\x80\x99s a famous fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d the rejoinder was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! do you mean to say that you mind her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal\xe2\x80\x99s voice; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, she sent him away from tea last\r\nnight, just for shying crusts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he go?\xe2\x80\x9d and there was a disagreeable sounding laugh, in which\r\nshe was sorry that Hal joined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch the Fr\xc3\xa4ulein serving me so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never tries!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knows better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Sam, I thought you had more spirit.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll be sitting up\r\npricking holes in a frill by the time the Captain comes back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Hal will be mincing along with his toes turned out like a\r\ndancing-master!\xe2\x80\x9d continued an affected voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such thing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hal angrily: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a fellow to be ordered\r\nabout!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Grevilles laughed; and one of them said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nshow it?  I\xe2\x80\x99d soon send her to the right-about if she tried to interfere\r\nwith me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook could bear it no longer; and facing suddenly round, looked\r\nthe speaker full in the face, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94but you should not speak quite so loud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys shrank back out of countenance; and Sam, who alone had not\r\nspoken, looked up into her face with a merry air, as if he were gratified\r\nby her spirited way of discomfiting them.\r\n\r\nOsmond tried to recover, and muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a sell!\xe2\x80\x9d rather impudently;\r\nbut they were now near the churchyard, and Mrs. Greville turning round,\r\nall was hushed.\r\n\r\nChristabel felt much vexed that all this should have happened just before\r\ngoing into church; she felt a good deal ruffled herself, and feared that\r\nBessie\xe2\x80\x99s head was filled with nonsense, if Hal\xe2\x80\x99s were not with something\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nThe church looked pretty outside, with the old weather-boarded wooden\r\nbelfry rising above the tiled roof and western gable; and it was neatly\r\nkept but not pretty within, the walls all done over with pale buff wash,\r\nand the wood-work very clumsy.  Sam and Susan behaved well and\r\nattentively; but Bessie fidgeted into her mamma\xe2\x80\x99s place, and would stand\r\nupon a hassock.  Miss Fosbrook was much afraid it was to keep in sight of\r\nthe beautiful bird.  Hal yawned; and Johnnie not only fidgeted unbearably\r\nhimself, but made his sister Annie do the same, till Miss Fosbrook\r\nscarcely felt as if she was at church, and made up her mind to tell\r\nJohnnie that she should leave him at home with the babies unless he\r\nchanged his ways.  Little David went on most steadily with his\r\nPrayer-Book, and scarcely looked off it till the sermon, when he fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook had one pleasure as she was going home.  The children had\r\nall gone on some steps before her, chattering eagerly among themselves,\r\nwhen Sam turned back and said abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\n_that_, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat those boys were saying? It depends on you whether you make me mind\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to make any rows if I can help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I hope you will be able to help it!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\r\nshould do if you did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam gave an odd smile with his honest face.  \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good\r\nspirit of your own.  It would take something to cow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t try!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam laughed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did promise Papa to be conformable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was very much obliged to you yesterday evening.  The behaviour of\r\nthe other boys depends so much on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it so much now I see you can\r\nstand up for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, what would it be if I had to write to your father that I could\r\nnot manage such a bear-garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take care that sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt would hinder\r\nall the good to Mamma!  I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, after a\r\nconfidential pause, \xe2\x80\x9cif we get beyond you, there\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Carey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you did not mean to get beyond me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam looked a little disconcerted, and it struck her that, though he would\r\nnot say so, he was doubtful whether the Greville influence might not\r\nrender Henry unmanageable; but he quickly gave it another turn.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\nyou must not plague us about London manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by London manners.  Do you mean not bawling\r\nat tea? for I mean to insist upon that, I assure you, and I want you to\r\nhelp me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! not being finikin, and mincing, and nonsensical!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I\xe2\x80\x99m not so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, laughing heartily; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you one thing, Sam, that I do wish you would leave off\xe2\x80\x94and that is\r\nteazing.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether that is country manners, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto see a sensible kind fellow like you just go out of your way to say\r\nsomething mortifying to a younger one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is fun.  They like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they really like it, there is no objection.  I know I should like\r\nvery much to have my brother here quizzing me; but you know very well\r\nthere are two sorts of such fun, and one that is only sport to the\r\nstronger side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBessie is so ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the very one I want to protect.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that teazing her\r\ndoes any good; it only gives her cross feelings.  And she really has more\r\nright on her side than you think.  You might be just as honest and bold\r\nif you were less rude and bearish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see her so affected and perked up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not affectation.  She is really more gentle and quiet than you\r\nare; you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it so in your Mamma, and she is like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma is not like Bessie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then about Davy.  How could you go and stop the poor little boy when\r\nhe was trying to think and feel rightly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was so funny,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will think another time whether your fun is safe and kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t be so particular,\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear it.  I thought the only way to do right was to be\r\nparticular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grunted, and flung away from her.  She was vexed to have sent him off\r\nin such a mood; but, unmannerly as he was, she saw so much good in him,\r\nthat she could not but hope he would be her friend and ally.\r\n\r\nDinner went off very peaceably, and then Susan fetched her two darlings\r\nfrom the nursery, George and Sarah, of three years and eighteen months\r\nold.  Her great perfection was as a motherly elder sister; and even Sam\r\nwas gentle to these little things, and played with them very nicely.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook reminded Hal of his Collect; but he observed that there was\r\nplenty of time, and continued to stand by the window, pursuing the flies\r\nwith his finger, not killing them, but tormenting them and David very\r\nseriously, by making them think he would\xe2\x80\x94not a very pretty business for\r\nthe day when all things should be happy, more like that which is always\r\nfound \xe2\x80\x9cfor idle hands to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvening service-time put an end to this sport; but Miss Fosbrook could\r\nnot set off till after a severe conflict with Johnnie.  She had decreed\r\nthat he should not go again that day, after his behaviour in the morning;\r\nand perhaps he would not have minded this punishment much if David had\r\nnot been going, which made him think it a disgrace.  So, in the most\r\nindependent manner be put on his hat, and was marching off, when Miss\r\nFosbrook stood in front of him, and ordered him back.\r\n\r\nHe repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to church.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was plain enough that he had\r\nheard what those boys had said about not submitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChurch is not the place to go to in a fit of wilfulness, Johnnie,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; and his sisters broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cO Johnnie!\xe2\x80\x9d but the naughty boy,\r\nfancying, perhaps, that want of time would lead to his getting his own\r\nway, marched on, sticking up his toes very high in the air.\r\n\r\nHal laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnnie, Johnnie dear,\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would Mamma say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn would not hear, and walked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cif you do not come back directly, I must\r\ncarry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had measured her strength with his: he was only eight years old, and\r\nshe believed that she could carry him; but he heard the church-bells\r\nringing, and thought he should have his way.\r\n\r\nShe laid hold of him, and he began fighting and kicking, in stout shoes,\r\nwhose thumps were no joke.  She held fast, but she felt frightened, and\r\ndoubtful of the issue of the struggle; and again there was Hal laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor-shame, Henry!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Sam; and the same moment those two feet\r\nwere secured, and John was a prisoner.  Miss Fosbrook called out to the\r\nrest to go on to church, and she and Sam dragged the boy up to the\r\nnursery, and shut him in there, roaring passionately.\r\n\r\nNurse Freeman, knowing nothing about it, could not believe but that the\r\nstranger lady had made her child naughty, and said something about their\r\nMamma letting him go to church; and \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the child wished to go to\r\nchurch, it seemed strange he should not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook would not defend herself, for she was in great haste; but\r\nSam exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cStuff! he was as naughty as could be all this morning,\r\nand only wanted to go now because he was told not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohnnie bellowed out something else, but Miss Fosbrook would not let Sam\r\ngo on; she touched his arm, and drew him off with her, he exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish old Freeman! she will pet and spoil him all church-time, till he\r\nis worse than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was lucky for her that she was too much hurried to dwell on this\r\nvexation; she almost ran to save herself from being late, and scarcely\r\nheard Sam\xe2\x80\x99s mutterings about wishing to break Martin Greville\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not hurry so much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a shorter cut, only I\r\nsuppose you can\xe2\x80\x99t get through a gap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed; and he led her on straight through the\r\nShort-horns.  Some of them looked at her more than she fancied, but she\r\nknew she might give up all hopes of Sam if he detected her fears.  Then\r\ncame the gap, where a tree had been cut down in the hedge, and such a\r\njump down from it!  But she gathered up her muslin, and made her leap so\r\ngallantly, that the boy cried,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! well done!\xe2\x80\x9d and came and walked close to her, saying\r\nconfidentially, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, do you think we shall ever do the pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure it might be done.  If you are likely to do it you must know\r\nbetter than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I much care about it.  It will be rather a bother;\r\nonly now we have said it, I shall hate it if we don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the pleasure of giving it will be a delightful reward for a\r\nlittle self-command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly Hal and the girls will make such a work about it.  I\xe2\x80\x99m glad, after\r\nall, that Bessie has nothing to do with it, or she would want to dress it\r\nup in flowers and ribbons.  Ha-ha!  But what a little crab it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure of that.  People may have other designs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBessie\xe2\x80\x99s can\xe2\x80\x99t be anything but trumpery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes present trumpery is a step to something better.  \xe2\x80\x98A was an\r\nArcher\xe2\x80\x99 is not very wise, but it is the road to reading\xe2\x80\x94and even if it\r\nwere not so, Sam, it is not right to shame people into giving; for what\r\nis not bestowed for the true reasons, does no good to giver nor to\r\nreceiver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam looked up with a frown of attention, as if he were trying to take in\r\nthe new light; but he did take it in, and smacking his hands together\r\nwith a noise like a pistol-shot, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAy, that\xe2\x80\x99s it!  We don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nwhat is grudged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook thought of words that would another time be more familiar\r\nto Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cNot grudgingly, nor of necessity, for God loveth a cheerful\r\ngiver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat she said was, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, if you plague Bessie too much, to make her\r\nlike ourselves, when she is really so different, you are driving her to\r\nthe shamming you despise so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ought not she to be cured of being silly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we have quite made up our minds upon what silliness is.  There, the\r\nbell has stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE most part of church-time Johnnie was eating Nurse Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplum-cake.  Perhaps this did not make him any easier in the conscience,\r\nbut he had a very unlucky sentiment, that as he was already naughty and\r\nin disgrace, it was of no use to take the trouble of being good till he\r\ncould make a fresh beginning; and after what the Grevilles had said, he\r\ndid not think that would be till Papa and Mamma came home; he did not at\r\nall mean to give in to a girl that was not even twenty.  So he would not\r\nturn to the only wise thing he could have done, the learning of his\r\nCollect, but he teased Nurse out of more cake and more, and got what play\r\nhe could out of little George, and that was not much, for Johnnie was not\r\nin a temper to be pleasant with a little one.\r\n\r\nComing home from church, Collects were to be learnt and said before tea:\r\nbut Hal, after glancing over his own, took up his cap and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nalong, Sam, Purday will be feeding the pigs; I want to choose the size of\r\nours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa never said we were to say them to Miss Fosbrook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe meant it though,\xe2\x80\x9d was all Sam\xe2\x80\x99s answer.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hinder me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no notion of being bound by what people mean,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hal;\r\nand no one could imagine the torment he made himself, neither going nor\r\nstaying, arguing the matter with his elder brother, as if Sam\xe2\x80\x99s coming\r\nwould justify him, and interrupting everyone; till at last Miss Fosbrook\r\ngathered all her spirit, and ordered him either to sit down and learn\r\nproperly at once, or to go quite away.  She was very much vexed, for\r\nHenry had been the most obliging and good-natured of all at first, and\r\nlikely to be fond of her; but such a great talker could not fail to be\r\nweak, and his vanity had been set against her.  He looked saucy at first,\r\nand much inclined to resist; if he had seen any sympathy for him in Sam\r\nhe might have done so, but Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s steady eye was too much for\r\nhim, so he saved his dignity, as he thought, by exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay in this stuffy hole with such a set of owls; I shall\r\ngo to Purday.\xe2\x80\x9d  And off he marched.\r\n\r\nThe others stayed, and said their Collects and Catechism very\r\nrespectably, all but John, who had not learned the Collect at all, and\r\nwas sent into another room to finish it, to which he made no resistance;\r\nhe had had enough of actual fighting with Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\nThen she offered to read a story to the others, but she found that this\r\nwas distasteful even to her friend Sam; he thought it stupid to be read\r\nto, and said he should see after Hal; David trotted after him, and Susan\r\nand Anne repaired to the nursery to play with the little ones and the\r\nbaby.  She minded it the less, as they all had some purpose; but she had\r\nalready been vexed to find that all but Davy preferred the most arrant\r\nvacant idleness to anything rational.  To be sure, Susan sometimes,\r\nBessie and Hal always, would read any book that made no pretensions to be\r\ninstructive, but even a fact about a lion or an elephant made them detect\r\nwisdom in disguise, and throw it aside.  She thought, however, she would\r\nmake the most of Bessie, and asked whether she would like to hear\r\nreading, or read to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie; and there was a silence, while Miss Fosbrook,\r\nglad of the quiet, began reading her _Christian Year_.  Presently she\r\nheard a voice so low that it seemed at a distance and it made her start,\r\nfor it was saying \xe2\x80\x9cChristabel!\xe2\x80\x9d then she almost laughed, for it seemed to\r\nhave been an audacious experiment, to judge by little Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s scared\r\nlooks and the glow on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I say it sometimes when we are alone together?\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do like it so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is such a pleasure to you, I would not deprive you of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Fosbrook, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t do so, except when we are alone, for\r\nyour Mamma would not like me to seem younger still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you!  Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a nice secret?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bessie, clinging to her\r\nhand: \xe2\x80\x9cand will you let me hug you sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little love was pleasant to Miss Fosbrook, when she was feeling lonely,\r\nand she took Bessie in her lap, and they exchanged caresses, to the\r\ndamage of the collar that Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s sister had worked for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t call me silly?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bessie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, with some arch fun; but Bessie had not\r\nmuch turn for fun, and presently went on\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you saw Ida Greville?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not much opportunity of learning what to think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut her parasol, and her bird!  Did you think her mama very silly to\r\ngive her pretty things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly not, unless she wore them at unsuitable times, or thought\r\ntoo much about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIda has so many, she does not think of them at all.  And she has shells,\r\nand such a lovely work-box, and picture-books; she has all she wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, quite sure! and they don\xe2\x80\x99t tease her for liking pretty things;\r\nher brothers keep quite away, and never bother about the schoolroom; but\r\nshe learns Italian and German, and drawing and singing.  Mr. Greville\r\nsaid something about our spending the day there.  Oh! if we do but go!\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t you, Miss Fosbrook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am asked, and if your Mamma would wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mamma always lets us go, except once\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I cried,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, hanging down her head; \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit.  It did seem so tiresome here, and she said I was learning to be\r\ndiscontented; but nobody can help wishing, can they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a way of not breaking the Tenth Commandment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t covet; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take things away from Ida, only to have\r\nthe same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but what does the explanation at the end of the Duty to our\r\nNeighbour say, filling out that Commandment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see what Susie is doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nChristabel sighed as the little girl walked off, displeased at having her\r\nrepinings set before her in a graver light than that in which she had\r\nhitherto chosen to regard them.\r\n\r\nShe saw no more of her charges till tea-time, when the bell brought them\r\nfrom different quarters, Johnnie with such a grimy collar and dirty\r\nhands, that he was a very un-Sunday-like figure, and she would have sent\r\nhim away to make himself decent, but that she was desirous of not\r\nover-tormenting him.\r\n\r\nSunday was always celebrated by having treacle with the bread, so the\r\nbutter riot was happily escaped; and Bessie was not in a gracious mood,\r\nand the corners of her mouth provoked the boys to begin on what they knew\r\nwould make her afford them sport.  Hal first: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Bet, didn\xe2\x80\x99t Purday\r\nwant his gun to-day at church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth put out her lip in expectation that something unpleasant was\r\nintended, and other voices were not slow to ask an explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShooting the cocky-olly birds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA general explosion of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say (always the preface to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s wit), shall I get a jay down off\r\nthe barn to stick into your hat, Betty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d said such a deplorable offended voice, that Sam, who had\r\nreally held his tongue at first, could not help chiming in,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; a cock-sparrow, for her London manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s for me, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel good-humouredly.  \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nLondon-bred sparrow; a pert forward chit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe really had found a safety-valve; the boys were entertained, and\r\ndiverted from their attack on their favourite victim, by finding everyone\r\nan appropriate bird; and when they came to \xe2\x80\x9cTomtits\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDishwashers,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwere so astonished at Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s never having seen either, that they\r\ninstantly fell into the greatest haste to finish their tea, and conduct\r\nher into the garden, and through a course of birds, eggs, and nests,\r\nabout which, as soon as she was assured that there was to be no\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s-nesting, she was very eager.\r\n\r\nBessie ought to have been thankful that her persecutors were called off,\r\nbut she was in a dismal mood, and was taken with a fit of displeasure\r\nthat her own Christabel Angela was following the rabble rout into the\r\ngarden, instead of staying in the school-room at her service.\r\n\r\nThe reason of her gloom was, that Miss Fosbrook had spoken a word that\r\nshe did not choose to take home, and yet which she could not shake off.\r\nSo she would neither stay in nor go out cheerfully, and sauntered along\r\nlooking so piteous, that Johnnie could not help making her worse by\r\nplucking at her dress, by suddenly twisting her cape round till the back\r\nwas in front, and pushing her hat over her eyes, till \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Johnnie,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\na dismal whine, alternated with \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Miss Fosbrook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristabel did not see nor hear.  She had gone forward with a boy on\r\neither side of her, and Susan walking backwards in front, all telling the\r\nstory of a cuckoo,\xe2\x80\x94or gowk, as Sara called it in Purday\xe2\x80\x99s language,\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nthey had found in a water-wagtail\xe2\x80\x99s nest in a heap of stones; how it sat\r\nup, constantly gaping with its huge mouth, while the poor little\r\nfoster-parents toiled to their utmost to keep it supplied with\r\ncaterpillars, and the last time it was seen, when full-fledged, were\r\ntrying to lure it to come out of the nest by holding up green palmers at\r\nsome little distance before it.  This was in the evening; by morning it\r\nwas gone, having probably taken flight at sunrise.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook listened with all the pleasure the boys could desire.  She\r\nhad read natural history, and looked at birds stuffed in the British\r\nMuseum, or alive at the Zoological Gardens, on the rare days when her\r\nfather had time to give himself and his children a treat; and her fresh\r\nvalue and interest in all these country things were delightful to the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely summer evening.  The sun was low enough to make the\r\nshadows long and refreshing, as they lay upon the blooming grass of the\r\nwilderness, softly swaying in the breeze, all pale with its numerous\r\nchaffy blossoms, and varied by the tall buttercups that raised up their\r\nshining yellow heads, or by white clouds of bold-faced ox-eye daisies.\r\n\r\nThe pear-trees were like white garlands; the apple-trees covered with\r\nwhite blossoms and rosy buds; the climbing roses on the wall were\r\nbursting into blossom; the sky was one blue vault without a cloud.\r\n\r\nSurely Elizabeth had no lack here of what was pretty.  Then why did she\r\nlag behind, unseeing, unheeding of all, but peevishly pushing off John\r\nand Anne, thinking that they always teased her worst on Sundays, and very\r\nmuch discomfited that Miss Fosbrook was not attending to her?  Surely the\r\nfault was not altogether in what was outside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d cry the boys.  Miss Fosbrook must first look up there, high upon\r\nthe side of the house, niched behind that thick stem of the vine.  What,\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t she see those round black eyes and little beak? They see her plain\r\nenough.  Ah! now she has them.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a fly-catcher.  By and by they\r\nshall be able to show her the old birds flying round, catching flies on\r\nthe wing, and feeding the young ones, all perched in a row.\r\n\r\nNow, can she scramble up the laurels?  Yes, she hopes so; though she\r\nwished she had known what was coming, for she would have changed her\r\nSunday muslin.  But a look of anxiety came on Sam\xe2\x80\x99s face as he peeped\r\ninto the clump of laurels; he signed back the others, sprang upon the\r\ndark scraggy bough of the tree, and Hal called out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone! has Ralph been there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, the black rascal; at least, I suppose so.  Not an egg left, and they\r\nwould have hatched this week!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Purday calls him his best friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe says we should\r\nnot get a currant or a gooseberry if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for that there raven, as\r\nPapa won\xe2\x80\x99t have the small birds shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring down the nest, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cGeorgy will like to have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children behind, who never could hear of anything to be had without\r\nlaying a claim to it, shouted that they wanted the nest; but Sam said Sue\r\nhad spoken first, and they fell back discontented, and more bent on their\r\nunkind sport.  Miss Fosbrook was rather shocked at the tearing out the\r\nnest, and asked if the old bird would not have another brood there; but\r\nit was explained that a thrush would never return to a forsaken nest; and\r\nwhen Sam came down with it in his hand, she was delighted with the\r\nwonderful cup that formed the lining, so smooth and firm a bason formed\r\nof dried mud set within the grassy wall.  She had thought that swallows\r\nalone built with mud, and had to learn that the swallows used their clay\r\nfor their outer walls, and down for their lining, whereas the thrush is a\r\nregular plasterer.\r\n\r\nSam promised her another thrush to make up for her disappointment, and\r\nmeantime conducted her to a very untidy old summer-house, the moss of\r\nwhose roof hung down loose and rough over a wild collection of headless\r\nwooden horses, little ships with torn sails, long sticks, battered\r\nwatering-pots, and old garden tools.  She was desired to look up to one\r\nof the openings in the ragged moss, and believe that it housed a kitty\r\nwren\xe2\x80\x99s family of sixteen or eighteen; but she had to take this on trust,\r\nfor to lay a finger near would lead to desertion; in fact, Sam was rather\r\nsorry to be able to point out to her, on coming out, the tiny, dark,\r\nnutmeg, cock-tailed father kitty, popping in and out of the thorn hedge,\r\nspying at the party.\r\n\r\nNow then for a wonder as they came out.  Sam waved everybody away\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nwaved is a small word for what he did\xe2\x80\x94shouted, pushed, ordered, would be\r\nmore like it.  He was going to give Miss Fosbrook such a proof of his\r\nesteem as hardly any one enjoyed, not even Hal, twice in the summer.\r\n\r\nEverybody submitted to his violent demonstrations, and Christabel\r\nfollowed him to the back of the summer-house.  There stood a large red\r\nflower-pot upside down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Fosbrook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s finger hooked into the hole at the top.  Off came the flower-pot,\r\nand disclosed something flying off with rushing wings, and something\r\nconfused remaining,\xe2\x80\x94a cluster of grey wings all quill, with gaping yellow\r\nmouths here and there opening, a huddling movement always going on in the\r\nforlorn heap, as if each were cold, and wanted to be undermost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTits, my tits!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam triumphantly; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ve built their nest here\r\nthree years following.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do they get in and out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the hole.  Take care, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you frighten away the bird?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no!  Ox-eyes aren\xe2\x80\x99t like wrens; I go to them every day.  See!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he took up in his hand a creature that could just be seen to be\r\nintended for a bird, though the long skinny neck was bare, and the tiny\r\nquills of the young wings only showed a little grey sprouting feather, as\r\ndid the breast some primrose-coloured down.  Miss Fosbrook had to part\r\nwith some favourite cockney notions of the beauty of infant birds, and on\r\nthe other hand to gain a vivid idea of what is meant by \xe2\x80\x9ccallow young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam quickly put his nestling back, and showed her the parent.  She could\r\nhardly believe that the handsome bird in the smooth grey coat and bright\r\nstraw-coloured waistcoat, with the broad jet-black line down the centre,\r\nthe great white cheeks edged with black, and the bold knowing look, could\r\nbe like what the little bits of deformity in the nest would soon become.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that\xe2\x80\x99s an ox-eye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll hear them going on\r\npeter\xe2\x80\x94peter\xe2\x80\x94peter\xe2\x80\x94all the spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sam was cut short by a loud and lamentable burst of roaring where\r\nthey had left the party.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook hurried back, hearing Hal\xe2\x80\x99s rude laugh as she came nearer,\r\nit was Elizabeth, sobbing in the passionate way in which it is not good\r\nto see a child cry, and violently shaking off Susan, who was begging her\r\nto stop herself before Miss Fosbrook should come.\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ the matter?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  Betty\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnnie _did_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnnie only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Hal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell-tale!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cCry-baby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe only cried that Miss Fosbrook might hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo shouted the little Babel, Bessie sobbing resentfully between her\r\nwords, till Miss Fosbrook, insisting that everybody should be quiet,\r\ndesired her to tell what had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnnie\xe2\x80\x94Johnnie called me a toad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others all burst out laughing, and Miss Fosbrook, trying to silence\r\nthem with a frown, said it was very rude of John, but she saw no reason\r\nwhy a girl of Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s age should act so childish a part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been teasing me, and so has Anne, all this time!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bessie.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been at me ever since I came out, pulling me and plaguing me,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you to walk in front of Miss Fosbrook, where\r\nthey could not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Johnnie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only pulled her frock and poked her ankles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne pleadingly\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly\xe2\x80\x94and why did you do what she did not like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohnnie looked sturdy and cross.  Anne hung her head; and Elizabeth burst\r\nout again,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey always do\xe2\x80\x94they always are cross to me!  I said I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you, and\r\nnow they said Ida was a conceited little toad, and stingy Bet was\r\nanother;\xe2\x80\x9d and out burst her howls again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very sad and improper way of spending a Sunday evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nFosbrook, who had really grown quite angry.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnne and John, I _will_ put\r\nan end to this teasing.  Go to bed this instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not dare to disobey, but went off slowly with sulky footsteps,\r\nmuttering to one another that Miss Fosbrook always took pipy Betty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart; Nurse said so, and they wished Mamma was at home.  And when they\r\ncame up to the nursery, Nurse pitied them.  She had never heard of a\r\nyoung lady doing such a thing as ordering off two poor dear children to\r\nbed for only just saying a word; but it seemed there were to be\r\nfavourites now.  No, she could not put them to bed; they must wait till\r\nMary came in from her walk; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to put herself out of the\r\nway for any fine London governess.\r\n\r\nSo Johnnie had another conquest over Miss Fosbrook; but Anne was\r\nuncomfortable, and went and sat in a corner, wishing she had had her\r\npunishment properly over, and kicking her brother away when he wanted to\r\nplay with her.\r\n\r\nAs for Bessie, she only cried the more for Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s trying to talk\r\nto her.  It was a way of hers, perhaps from being less strong than the\r\nothers, if once she started in a cry she could not leave off.\r\n\r\nSusan told Miss Fosbrook so; and the boys tried to drag her on with a\r\npromise of a blackbird\xe2\x80\x99s nest; but she thought them unfeeling to such\r\nwoeful distress, and first tried to reason with Bessie, then to soothe\r\nher, till at last, finding all in vain, she thought bed the only place\r\nfor the child, and led her into the house, helped her, still shaking with\r\nsobs, to undress, and was going to see her lie down in the bed which she\r\nshared with Susan.  Elizabeth was still young enough to say her prayers\r\naloud.  The words came out in the middle of choking sobs, not as if she\r\nwere much attending to them.  Miss Fosbrook knelt down by her as she was\r\ngoing to rise, and said in her own words,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost merciful God, give unto this Thy child the spirit of content, and\r\nthe spirit of love, that she may bear patiently all the little trials\r\nthat hurt and vex her, and win her way as Thy good soldier and servant.\r\nAmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth held her breath to listen.  It was new and odd.  She did not\r\nlike to say Amen; she did not know if the governess were not taking a\r\nliberty.  Perhaps it was a new way of telling her she was\r\nwrong\xe2\x80\x94Christabel, whom she had thought on her side.\r\n\r\nThe bad temper woke up, and would not let her offer a friendly kiss.  She\r\nhid her face in the pillow, and as soon as Miss Fosbrook had shut the\r\ndoor, went off into a fresh gust of piteous sobs, because Miss Elizabeth\r\nMerrifield was the most miserable ill-used child in all the world.\r\n\r\nShe might be one of the most miserable, but it was not because of her\r\nill-usage, but because she had no spirit to be cheerful, and had turned\r\naway from comfort of the right kind.  She was in such a frame as to\r\nprefer thinking everyone against her, to supposing that anything she\r\ncould do would mend matters.\r\n\r\nChristabel was much grieved at this unfortunate end to the Sunday\r\nevening.  She looked over all the boys\xe2\x80\x99 birds\xe2\x80\x99 eggs\xe2\x80\x94they were allowed to\r\nkeep two of every sort as curiosities\xe2\x80\x94and listened to some wonderful\r\nstories of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s about climbing trees, and shooting partridges, and she\r\nkept the remaining children quiet and amused; but she was not happy in\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\nShe thought she must have been wrong in not watching them more closely,\r\nand she felt more dislike and indignation against Johnnie than she feared\r\nwas altogether right in his governess.  Also, she feared to make too much\r\nof Elizabeth, and was almost afraid that notice taught her to be still\r\nmore fretful.  And yet there was a sense of being drawn to her by their\r\ntwo minds understanding each other, by likeness of tastes, by pity, and\r\nby a wish to protect one whom her little world oppressed.\r\n\r\nNurse Freeman could not be more afraid of Miss Fosbrook making favourites\r\nthan she was herself.\r\n\r\nAll she could do in the matter was that which she had already done at\r\nBessie\xe2\x80\x99s bedside, and much more fully than when the little girl was\r\nlistening to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH Monday morning began the earning of the pig.  Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nbusiness after prayers was to deal out the week\xe2\x80\x99s allowance\xe2\x80\x94sixpence to\r\neach of the four elders, threepence apiece to the three younger ones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay there be no fines,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not have the hundredth part of a fine!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Henry, tossing his\r\nmoney into the air.\r\n\r\nLittle David\xe2\x80\x99s set lips expressed the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease let me have a whole sixpence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nchange, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t spend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Sukey! you\xe2\x80\x99d better have the four farthings,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe the first to want them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan laughed; and Miss Fosbrook, partly as an example to the plaintive\r\nElizabeth, said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are so good-humoured, Susie, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it\r\nin my heart to demand a fine\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94your hair; and there,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to the\r\nstout red fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you ever behold such a black little row?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, in her good-humoured hearty voice, \xe2\x80\x9chow tiresome,\r\nwhen they were _so_ clean this morning, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve only just been feeding\r\nthe chicken, and up in the hay-loft for the eggs, and pulling the\r\nradishes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go and wash and brush, and to-morrow remember the pig,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nFosbrook, unable to help comparing the radishes and the fingers for\r\nredness and for earthiness.\r\n\r\nIt was a more difficult matter when, as Elizabeth put her silver coin\r\ninto her purse, John must needs repeat the stupid old joke, \xe2\x80\x9cThere goes\r\nstingy Bet!\xe2\x80\x9d and Bessie put on her woeful appealing face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn, I shall punish you if I hear those words again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.  Nurse says you have no business to punish me!  She did\r\nnot put me to bed; and I had such fun!  Oh, such fun!\xe2\x80\x9d and the boy looked\r\nup with a grin that set all the others laughing.\r\n\r\nChristabel resolutely kept silence, and hoped her looks did not show her\r\nannoyance, as the boy went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI got lots of goodies, for Nurse said she\r\nhad no notion of no stranger punishing her children.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d  For\r\nSamuel had hold of his ear, and was tweaking it sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!  Go and tell Nurse, if you like, baby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam, indeed I can\xe2\x80\x99t have my battles fought in that way!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\ngoverness, much distressed, as Johnnie roared, perhaps that old Nurse\r\nmight hear, and, to all attempts to find out whether he were hurt,\r\noffered only heels and fists, till Susan came back and hugged him into\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow Johnnie has cried before breakfast on a Monday morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9call the rest of the week will go wrong with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope no such thing.\xe2\x80\x94Suppose we try and\r\nshow Annie she is wrong, Johnnie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Johnnie was sulky, and even Susan looked as if she thought this a new\r\nand dangerous notion.  Sam laughed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you joy, Miss\r\nFosbrook.  Now he\xe2\x80\x99ll think he must be naughty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnnie,\xe2\x80\x9d said David solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pig was a very good master of the ceremonies, and kept all elbows off\r\nthe table at breakfast-time; and Bessie, who was apt to stick fast in the\r\nmidst of her bread and milk, and fall into disgrace for daintiness and\r\ndawdling, finished off quietly and prosperously.\r\n\r\nThen every one was turned loose till nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.  Susan had charge of\r\nMamma\xe2\x80\x99s keys, and had to go down to the kitchen, see what the cook\r\nwanted, and put it out, but only on condition that no brother or sister\r\never went with her to the store-closet.  Susan was highly trustworthy,\r\nbut Mamma was too wise to let her be tempted by voices begging for one\r\nplum, one almond, or the last spoonful of Jam.  It took away a great deal\r\nof the pleasure of jingling the keys, and having a voice in choosing the\r\npudding.\r\n\r\nThe two elder boys went to their tutor, the other children to the\r\nnursery, except Elizabeth, who was rummaging in her little box, and\r\nDavid, whom Miss Fosbrook found perched on the ledge of the window,\r\nreading a book that did not look as if it were meant for men of his size.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Fosbrook thought David like the oldest person in the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94infinitely older than John, who could do nothing better than he\r\nexcept running and bawling, and a good deal older than even Hal and Sam.\r\nNay, there were times when he raised his steady eyes and slowly spoke out\r\nhis thoughts, when she felt as if he were much more wise and serious than\r\nher twenty-years old self.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Davy,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as at the sound of the lesson-bell the little\r\nold man uncrossed his sturdy legs, closed his book, and arose with a\r\nsigh, \xe2\x80\x9chave you found out all about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found out why a pig is a profitable investment,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he will feed upon refuse, and fatten upon cheap food,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDavid, in the words of his book; \xe2\x80\x9conly I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out why.  Do you\r\nknow, Miss Fosbrook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see what you want to know, Davy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know why a pig gets fat on barley-meal, when an ox wants\r\nmange, and oil-cake and hay.  I asked Nurse, and she said little boys\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions; and I asked Purday, and he said it was because\r\npigs is pigs, and oxen is oxen.  Why do you think it is, Miss Fosbrook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think; I know it is because the great God has made one sort of\r\ncreature to be easily fed, and made good for poor people to live upon,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed on her as if he still had questions to ask, and\r\nshe was quite afraid of her powers of answering them, for he was new in\r\nthe world, and saw the strangeness of many things to which older people\r\nbecome used by living with them, but which are not the less strange for\r\nall that.\r\n\r\nHowever, the trampling of many feet put an end to question and answer,\r\nand the day\xe2\x80\x99s work had to begin with the Psalms, and reading the Morning\r\nLessons.  Bessie was by far the best reader; and David did very well,\r\nthough he made very long stops to look deliberately at any long new word,\r\nand could not bear to be told before he had mastered it for himself.\r\nEven Susan was sadly given to gabbling and missing the little words that\r\nshe thought beneath her attention; and the other two stumbled so\r\nhorribly, that it was pain to hear them.\r\n\r\nThis beginning might be taken as the sign of how all would do their\r\nlessons.  It is only a child here and there, generally a lonely one, to\r\nwhom lessons can be anything but a toil and an obligation.  Even with\r\nclever ones, who may be interested in some part of their study, some\r\nother branch will be disagreeable; and there is nothing in the whole\r\nworld to be learnt without drudgery, so it would be unreasonable to\r\nexpect lessons to be regarded as delightful; but there is one thing that\r\nis to be expected of any good child\xe2\x80\x94not to enjoy lessons; not to surpass\r\nothers; not to do anything surprising; only to make a conscience of doing\r\nwhat is required as well as possible.\r\n\r\nNow do not many children seem to think that they are to receive as little\r\nas they can possibly take in without being punished; or that, if they\r\nmake any exertion, their teachers ought to be so much obliged to them,\r\nthat some great praise or reward is due to them?\r\n\r\nLet us see whether anyone in Stokesley school-room was making a\r\nconscience of the day\xe2\x80\x99s tasks.  It is not of much use to ask for any at\r\npresent in Johnnie\xe2\x80\x94not for a whole week, as Annie would declare; he does\r\nnot know his single Latin declension; his spelling, is all abroad; his\r\ngeography wild; yet though turned back once, he misses the fine by just\r\nsaying his lessons passably the last time.  They perhaps ought, in strict\r\njustice, to have been sent back; but Miss Fosbrook was very glad to be\r\nsaved the uproar that would have ensued, and almost wondered whether she\r\nwere not timidly merciful to the horrible copy and the greasy slate.  But\r\nJohnnie had no fine, and was as proud of it as if he had been a good boy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t caught him out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if his kind governess had been\r\nhis enemy.\r\n\r\nAs to Annie, her French verbs were always dreadful things to hear, and\r\nthe little merry face, usually so bright, used to grow quite deplorable\r\nwith the trouble she took not to use her mind.  Using her memory was bad\r\nenough, but saying things by heart was an affliction she was used to, and\r\nit was very shocking of Miss Fosbrook to require her to find out _how_\r\nmany years Richard II. had reigned, if he began in 1377 and ended in\r\n1399.  Susan prompted her, however; so she really got a triumph over Miss\r\nFosbrook, and was quite saved from thinking.  Oh, but the teasing woman!\r\nshe silenced Susan, and would have this poor injured Annie tell how old\r\nthe tiresome man was.  \xe2\x80\x9cBegan to reign at eleven years old, dethroned\r\nafter twenty-two years; how old was he?\xe2\x80\x9d  Annie found bursting out crying\r\neasier than thinking, and then they all cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cO Nanny, the pig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand Miss Fosbrook had the barbarity to call that _foolish_ crying!  What\r\nmight one cry for, if not at being asked how old Richard II. was?  If the\r\nfine must be paid, there was no use in stopping; so Annie howled till\r\nMiss Fosbrook turned her out to finish on the stairs; and as Nurse\r\nFreeman was out with the little ones, there was no one to comfort her; so\r\nshe cried till she was tired, and when the noise ceased, Susan was\r\nallowed to come and coax her, and fetch her back to go on with her copy,\r\nas soon as her hand was steady enough.  She felt very foolish by this\r\ntime, and thought David eyed her rather angrily and contemptuously; so\r\nshe crept quietly to her corner, and felt sad and low-spirited all the\r\nrest of the morning.  Now that thirty-three had come into her head, it\r\nseemed so stupid not to have thought of it in time; and then she would\r\nhave saved her farthing, and her eyes would not have been so hot.\r\n\r\nMaybe, too, Susan\xe2\x80\x99s French phrases would not have been turned back.  Miss\r\nFosbrook would have given a great deal not to have been obliged to do it,\r\nbut she had prompted flagrantly already, and a teacher is obliged to have\r\na conscience quite as much as a scholar; so the book was given back, and\r\nSusan spent twelve minutes in see-sawing herself, and going over the\r\nsentences in a rapid whispering gabble, a serious worry to the governess\r\nin listening to Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s practising and David\xe2\x80\x99s reading, but she thought\r\nit would be a hardship to be forbidden to learn in her own way at that\r\nmoment, and forbore.  David was interrupted in his \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHistory,\xe2\x80\x9d and looked rather cross about it, for Susan to try again.  She\r\nmade all the same blunders\xe2\x80\x94and more too!  Back again!  Poor Susie!  Once,\r\ntwice, thrice, has she read those stupid words over, and knows less of\r\nthem than before.  Davy\xe2\x80\x99s loud voice will go into her understanding\r\ninstead of those French phrases.  She looks up in dull stupefaction.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rufus is disposed of, and David, as grave as a judge, is taking\r\nup his slate, looking a little fussed because there is a scratch in the\r\ncorner.  \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\nSusan jumps up in desperation, and puts her hands behind her.  Oh dear!\r\noh dear! all that the gentlemen on a journey were saying to one another\r\nhas gone clean out of her head!\r\n\r\nShe cannot recollect the three first words.  She only remembers that this\r\nis the third time, and another farthing is gone!  She stands and stares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Fosbrook severely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou never tried to learn this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan gives a little gasp; and Elizabeth, who has said her French without\r\na blunder, puts in an unnecessary and not very sisterly word: \xe2\x80\x9cSusan\r\nnever will learn her French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan\xe2\x80\x99s honest eyes fill with tears, but she gulps them back.  She will\r\nnot cry away another farthing, but she does feel it very cross in Bessie,\r\nand she is universally miserable.\r\n\r\nChristabel feels heated, wearied, and provoked, and as if she were fast\r\nlosing her own temper; and that made her resolve on mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with an effort, \xe2\x80\x9crun twice to the great lime-tree and\r\nback.  Then take the book into my room, read this over three times, and\r\nwe will try again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan looked surprised, but she obeyed, came back, and repeated the\r\nphrases better than she had ever said French before.  She was absolutely\r\nsurprised and highly pleased, and she finished off her other lessons\r\nswimmingly; but oh, she was glad to be rid of them!  Yes, they were off\r\nher mind, and so she deserved that they should be!  She flew away to the\r\nnursery, and little Sarah was soon crowing in her arms.\r\n\r\nElizabeth?  Not a blunder in French verbs or geography\xe2\x80\x94very tidy copy.\r\nFrench reading good; English equally so, only it ended in a pout, because\r\nthere was not time for her to go on to see what became of Carthage; and\r\nshe was a most intolerable time in learning her poetry out of the book of\r\nReadings, or rather she much preferred reading the verses in other parts\r\nof the book to getting perfect in her lesson, and then being obliged to\r\nturn her mind to arithmetic.  Miss Fosbrook called her three times; and\r\nat last she turned round peevishly at being interrupted in the middle of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cFriar of Orders Gray,\xe2\x80\x9d and repeated her twenty lines of Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWinter\xe2\x80\x99s Walk\xe2\x80\x9d in a doleful whine, though without a blunder.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the horrible novelties that Miss Fosbrook was bringing in,\r\nthat she expected people to understand their sums as well as work them.\r\nShe gave much shorter ones, to be sure, than Mamma, who did sometimes set\r\na long multiplication sum of such a huge size, that it looked as if it\r\nwere meant to keep the victim out of the way; but who would not prefer\r\ncasting up any length of figures, to being required to explain the\r\nmeaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nReally, if it had not been for the pig, that shocking question might have\r\nled to a mutiny in the school-room.  When it was bad enough to do the\r\nthing, how could anyone ask what was meant by the operation, and why it\r\nwas performed?\r\n\r\nWhat did Bessie do when her sum was being overlooked?  Miss Fosbrook read\r\non: \xe2\x80\x9c4 from 8, 4; 7 from 1\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99s this, Bessie?  7 from 10 are\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c3, and 1 are 4,\xe2\x80\x9d dolorously, as her 3 was changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, what next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you was meant by carry one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, not in the least thinking \xe2\x80\x9cthe tens\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\nanything to do with the matter, but only that she had heard something\r\nabout them, and could thus get rid of the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Bessie, what tens can you possibly mean?  Think a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you said tens once,\xe2\x80\x9d said injured innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was in an addition sum.  See, here it is quite different.  I told\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie put on a vacant stare.  She was not going to attend to what she\r\ndid not like.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook saw the face.  She absolutely shrank from provoking another\r\nfit of crying, and went quickly through the explanation.  She saw that\r\nher words might as well have been spoken to the slate.  Bessie neither\r\nlistened nor took them in.  Not all her love for her dear Christabel\r\nAngela could stir her up to make one effort contrary to her inclinations.\r\nThe slate was given back to her, she wiped out the sum in a pet, and ran\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook turned round, David, whose lessons had been perfectly\r\nrepeated an hour ago, was sitting cross-legged in the window, with his\r\nslate and pencil, and a basket of bricks, his great delight, which he was\r\nplacing in rows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t this it?  Twelve bricks; take away those\r\nseven, then\xe2\x80\x941, 2, 3, 4, 5\xe2\x80\x94the twelve is only 5: the 10 is gone, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nso you must leave one out of the next figure in the upper line of the\r\nsum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Davy had only begun arithmetic on the governess\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, but he had\r\nlearnt numeration and addition in her way.  She was so delighted, that\r\nshe stooped down and kissed him, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, my little man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavy rather disapproved of the kiss, and rubbed his brown-holland elbow\r\nover his face, as if to clear it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Christabel, as she hurried away for five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 peace\r\nin her own room before the dinner-bell, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a comfort to have one\r\npupil whose whole endeavour is not to frustrate one\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to educate\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor young thing! that one little bit of sense had quite cheered her up.\r\nOtherwise she was not one whit less weary than the children.  She had\r\nbeen learning a very tough lesson too\xe2\x80\x94much harder than any of theirs; and\r\nshe was not at all certain that she had learnt it right.\r\n\r\nNow, readers, of all the children, who do you think had used the most\r\nconscience at the lessons?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT an entirely different set of beings were those Stokesley children in\r\nlesson-time and out of it!  Talk of the change of an old thorn in winter\r\nto a May-bush in spring! that was nothing to it!\r\n\r\nPoor, listless, stolid, deplorable logs, with bowed backs and crossed\r\nankles, pipy voices and heavy eyes!  Who would believe that these were\r\nthe merry, capering, noisy creatures, full of fun and riot, clattering\r\nand screeching, and dancing about with ecstasy at Sam\xe2\x80\x99s information that\r\nthere was a bonfire by the potato-house!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bonfire!\xe2\x80\x9d said the London governess, thinking of illuminations; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ncan that be for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is not _for_ anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cit is Purday burning weeds.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you smell them?  How nice they are!  I was afraid it was only\r\nFarmer Smith burning couch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the noses were elevated to scent from afar a certain smoky odour,\r\nusually to be detected in July breezes, and which reminded Miss Fosbrook\r\nof a brick-field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPotatoes!  Potatoes!  We\xe2\x80\x99ll roast some potatoes, and have them for tea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbellowed all the voices; so that Miss Fosbrook could hardly find a space\r\nfor very unwillingly saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dears, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I ought to let you play with fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we always do,\xe2\x80\x9d roared the children; and Susan added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe always roast potatoes when there\xe2\x80\x99s a bonfire.  Mamma always lets us;\r\nit is only Purday that is cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; Mamma lets us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if Sam and Susan say it is right, I trust to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nFosbrook gladly; \xe2\x80\x9conly you must let me come out and see what it is.  I am\r\ntoo much of a Londoner to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll roast you some potatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the uproarious population tumbled upstairs, there to be invested with\r\nrougher brown-holland garments than those that already concealed the\r\nsprigged cottons of the girls; and when the five came down again, they\r\nwere so much alike in dress, that it was not easy to tell girls from\r\nboys.  Susan brought little George down with her, and off the party set.\r\nSam and Hal, who had been waiting in the hall, took Miss Fosbrook between\r\nthem, as if they thought it their duty to do the honours of the bonfire,\r\nand conducted her across the garden, through the kitchen-garden, across\r\nwhich lay a long sluggish bar of heavy and very odorous smoke, to a gate\r\nin a quickset hedge.  Here were some sheds and cart-houses, a fagot pile,\r\nvarious logs of timber, a grindstone, and\xe2\x80\x94that towards which all the\r\neight children rushed with whoops of ecstasy\xe2\x80\x94a heap of smoking rubbish,\r\nchiefly dry leaves, and peas and potato haulm, with a large allowance of\r\ncabbage stumps\xe2\x80\x94all extremely earthy, and looking as if the smouldering\r\nsmoke were a wonder from so mere a heap of dirt.\r\n\r\nNo matter!  There were all the children round it, some on their knees,\r\nsome jumping; and voices were crying on all sides,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO jolly, jolly!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get some potatoes!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you must have some\r\nsticks first, and make some ashes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no flame\xe2\x80\x94not a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cGet\r\nout of the way, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?  I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a hot place.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll each have our\r\nown oven, and roast our own potatoes!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Sam; you\xe2\x80\x99re pushing me\r\ninto the smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis of course was from Elizabeth; and there followed, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Bessie,\r\nyou will tread upon Georgie.\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Georgie, you _shall_ have a place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSticks, sticks!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Henry; while Sam was on his knees, poking out a\r\nspecies of cavern in the fire, where some symptoms of red embers\r\nappeared, which he diligently puffed with his mouth, feeding it with\r\nleaves and smaller chips in a very well practised way.  \xe2\x80\x9cSticks, Annie!\r\nJohnnie!  Davy! get sticks, I say, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make an oven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnnie obeyed; but the two little boys were intent on imitating Sam on\r\nanother side of the fire, and Johnnie uttered a gruff \xe2\x80\x9cGet \xe2\x80\x99em yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhile David took no notice at all.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Hal would have betaken himself to no gentle means if Susan had\r\nnot hastily put in his way a plentiful supply of dead wood, which she had\r\nbeen letting little George think he picked up all himself; and there was\r\nkeen excitement, which Christabel could not help sharing, while under\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s breath the red edges of the half-burnt chip glowed, flushed,\r\nwidened, then went sparkling doubtfully, slowly, to the light bit of\r\npotato-stalk that he held to it, glowing as he blew\xe2\x80\x94fading, smoking, when\r\nhe took breath.  Try again\xe2\x80\x94puff, puff, puff diligently; the fire\r\nevidently has a taste for the delicate little shaving that Annie has\r\nfound for it; it seizes on it; another\xe2\x80\x94another; a flame at last.  Hurrah!\r\npile on more; not too much.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it out!\xe2\x80\x9d  Oh, there! strong\r\nflame\xe2\x80\x94coming crackling up through those smothering heaps of stick and\r\nhaulm; it won\xe2\x80\x99t be kept down; it rises in the wind; it is a red flaring\r\nbanner.  The children shriek in transports of admiration, little George\r\nloudest of all, because Susan is holding him tight, lest he should run\r\ninto the brilliant flame.  Miss Fosbrook is rather appalled, but the\r\nchildren are all safe on the windward side, and seem used to it; so she\r\nsupposes it is all right, and the flame dies down faster than it rose.\r\nIt is again an innocent smouldering heap, like a volcano after an\r\neruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must not let it blaze again just yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep it down well\r\nwith sticks, to make some nice white ashes for the potatoes.  See, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake an oven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were all stooping round this precious hot corner, some kneeling,\r\nsome sitting on the ground, David with hands on his sturdy knees\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nintent on nursing that creeping red spark, as it smouldered from chip to\r\nchip, leaving a black trace wherever it went, when through the thick\r\nsmoke, that was like an absolute curtain hiding everything on the farther\r\nside, came headlong a huge bundle of weeds launched overwhelmingly on the\r\nfire, and falling on the children\xe2\x80\x99s heads in an absolute shower, knocking\r\nJohnnie down, but on a soft and innocent side of the fire among the\r\ncabbage-stumps, and seeming likely to bury Sam, who leant over to shelter\r\nhis precious oven, and puffed away as if nothing was happening, amid the\r\nvarious shouts around him, in which \xe2\x80\x9cPurday\xe2\x80\x9d was the most audible word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got at he, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Purday, leaning on the fork\r\nwith which he had thrown on the weeds.  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is safe from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you thought you had a new place, Purday, and circumvented us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Hal; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we smelt you out, you old rogue; we weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be\r\nbaulked of our bonfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook here ventured on asking if they were doing mischief; and\r\nPurday answered with an odd gruff noise, \xe2\x80\x9cMischief enough\xe2\x80\x94ay, to be\r\nsure\xe2\x80\x94hucking the fire all abroad.  It\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re always after.  I did\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99d got it safe out of their way this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d in rather a frightened voice, for she felt that it would be a\r\ntremendous trial of her powers, \xe2\x80\x9cshould I make them come away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch her!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Hal.\r\n\r\nThere was horror and disapprobation on Susan\xe2\x80\x99s face.  Annie stood with\r\nher mouth open; while John, throwing himself on the ground with fury,\r\nrolled over, crying out something about, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvery cross;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nDavid lay flat on his face, puffing at his own particular oven, like a\r\nlittle Wind in an old picture.  Sam waited, leaning on the ashen stick\r\nthat served him as a poker.  It was the most audacious thing he had ever\r\nheard.  Rob them of their bonfire!  Would that old traitor of a Purday\r\nabet her?\r\n\r\nPerhaps Purday was as much astonished as the rest; but, after all, much\r\nas the children tormented his bonfires, overset his haycocks, and\r\ndisturbed his wood-pile, he did not like anyone to scold them but\r\nhimself, much less the new London Lady; so he made up an odd sort of\r\ngrin, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t that they do so much harm; let\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em bide;\xe2\x80\x9d and he proceeded to shake on the rest of his barrowful,\r\ntumbling the weeds down over David\xe2\x80\x99s cherished oven in utter disregard;\r\nbut the children cried with one voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah!  Purday, we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo any harm, so don\xe2\x80\x99t ever grumble again.  Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for _her_, the crosspatch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnnie to Annie,\r\nnever hearing or heeding Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s fervent \xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as long as the foolish boy remembered it, he always did believe that\r\nMiss Fosbrook was so cross as to want to hinder them from their bonfire,\r\nonly Purday would not let her.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook did not trouble herself to be understood; she was relieved\r\nto have done her duty, and be free to rejoice in and share the pleasure.\r\nShe ran about and collected materials for Sam till she was out of breath,\r\nand joined in all the excitement as the fire showed symptoms of reviving,\r\nafter being apparently crushed out by Purday.  Sam and Susan, at least,\r\nbelieved that she had only spoken to Purday because she thought it right;\r\nbut even for them to forgive interference with their bonfire privileges\r\nwas a great stretch.\r\n\r\nAt last she thought it time to leave them to their own devices, and seize\r\nthe moment for some quiet reading; but she had not reached the house\r\nbefore little steps came after her, and she saw Elizabeth running fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are so tiresome,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cSam won\xe2\x80\x99t let me stand anywhere but\r\nwhere the smoke gets into my eyes, and George plagues so!  May I come in\r\nwith you, dear Christabel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am sorry to hear so\r\nmany complaints.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are so cross to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie; \xe2\x80\x9cthey always are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must try to be cheerful and good-humoured with them, and they will\r\nleave off vexing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut may I come in?  It will be a nice time for my secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristabel saw little hope for her intended reading, but she was always\r\nglad of a space for making Bessie happy, so she kindly consented to the\r\nbringing out of the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s treasury, and the dismal face grew\r\nhappy and eager.  The subjects of the drawings were all clear in her\r\nhead; that was not the difficulty, but the cardboard, the ribbon, the\r\nreal good paints.  One little slip of card Miss Fosbrook hunted out of\r\nher portfolio; she cut a pencil of her own, and advised the first attempt\r\nto be made upon a piece of paper.  The little bird that Bessie produced\r\nwas really not at all bad, and her performance was quite fair enough to\r\nmake it worth while to go on, since Miss Fosbrook well knew that mammas\r\nare pleased with works of their children, showing more good-will than\r\nskill.  For why?  Their value is in the love and thought they show.\r\n\r\nThe little bird was made into a robin with the colours in a paint-box\r\nthat Bessie had long ago bought; but they were so weak and muddy, that\r\nthe result was far from good enough for a present, and it was agreed that\r\nreal paints must be procured as well as ribbon.  Miss Fosbrook offered to\r\ncommission her sisters to buy the Prussian blue, lake, and gamboge in\r\nLondon, and send them in a letter.  This was a new idea to Bessie, and\r\nshe was only not quite decided between the certainty that London paints\r\nmust be better than country ones, and the desire of the walk to Bonchamp\r\nto buy some; but the thought that the ribbon, after all, might be\r\nprocured there, satisfied her.  The little doleful maid was changed into\r\nan eager, happy, chattering child, full of intelligence and contrivance,\r\nand showing many pretty fancies, since there was no one to tease her and\r\nlaugh at her; and her governess listened kindly and helpfully.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook could not help thinking how much happier her little\r\ncompanion would have been as an only child, or with one sister, and\r\nparents who would have made the most of her love of taste and refinement,\r\ninstead of the hearty busy parents, and the rude brothers and sisters,\r\nwho held her cheap for being unlike themselves.  But then she bethought\r\nher, that perhaps Bessie might have grown up vain and affected, had all\r\nthese tastes been petted and fostered, and that perhaps her little\r\nhardships might make her the stronger, steadier, more useful woman,\r\ninstead of living in fancies.  It was the unkindness on one side, and the\r\ntemper on the other, that made Miss Fosbrook uneasy.\r\n\r\nThe work had gone on happily for nearly an hour, and Bessie was copying a\r\nforget-me-not off a little painted card-board pincushion of her own, when\r\nsteps were heard, little trotting steps, and Susan came in with little\r\nGeorge.  He had been pushed down by Johnnie, and was rather in a fretful\r\nmood; and Susan had left all her happy play to bring him in to rest and\r\ncomfort him, coming to the school-room because Nurse Freeman was out.\r\nBefore Elizabeth had time to hide away her doings, George had seen the\r\nbright pincushion, and was holding out his hands for it.  Bessie hastily\r\npocketed it.  George burst out crying; and Susan, without more ado, threw\r\nherself on her sister, and, pinioning Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s slight arm by the greater\r\nstrength of her firm one, was diving into her pocket in spite of her\r\nstruggles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan, leave off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9clet your sister alone.  She has\r\na right to do what she likes with her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so cross in her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, obeying however, but only to snatch\r\nup little George, and hug and kiss him.  \xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear little man! is Betty\r\ncross to him?  There! there! come with Sue, and _she\xe2\x80\x99ll_ get him\r\nsomething pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusie, Susie, indeed it\xe2\x80\x99s only that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to spoil it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nElizabeth, distressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA foolish thing like that!  Why, the only use of it is to please the\r\nchildren; but you are just such a baby as he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, still\r\npitying George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better put your things away, Bessie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook,\r\ninterfering to stop the dispute; and as soon as Elizabeth was gone, and\r\nGeorge a little pacified by an ivory ribbon-measure out of Miss\r\nFosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s work-box, she observed to Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you must not let\r\nyour love for the little ones make you unjust and unkind to Bessie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe always is so unkind to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan resentfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think she feels unkindly; but if you tyrannize over her, and\r\nforce her to give way to them, you cannot expect her to like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma says the elder must give way to the younger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not try whether she would give way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because I knew she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; and I could not have my little Georgie\r\nvexed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I could not see my little Susie violent and unjust,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nFosbrook cheerfully.  \xe2\x80\x9cJustice first, Susan; you had no right to rob\r\nBessie for George, any more than I should have to give away a dinner of\r\nyour papa\xe2\x80\x99s because he had refused a beggar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa never would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, rather going off from the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely; but do you understand me, Susan?  I will not have Bessie\r\n_forced_ out of her rights for the little ones.  Not Bessie only, but\r\nnobody is to be tyrannized over; it is not right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBessie is so nonsensical,\xe2\x80\x9d was all Susan said, looking glum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely she may seem so to you; but if you knew more, you would see\r\nthat all is not nonsense that seems so to you.  Some people would admire\r\nher ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Greville told Mrs. Brownlow that Bessie\r\nwas the only one among us that was capable of civilisation; but Mrs.\r\nGreville is a fine lady, and we always laugh at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d as Bessie returned, \xe2\x80\x9cyou want to go out to your play again, my\r\ndear.  Will you leave Georgie with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan was a little doubtful about trusting her darling with anyone,\r\nespecially one who could take Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s part against him; but she wished\r\nexceedingly to be present at the interesting moment of seeing whether the\r\npotatoes were done enough, and George was perfectly contented with\r\nmeasuring everything on the ribbon, so she ran quickly off, without the\r\nmanners to thank Miss Fosbrook, but to assure the rest of the party that\r\nthe governess really was very good-natured, and that she would save her\r\nbiggest and best potato for Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s tea.\r\n\r\nChristabel managed very happily with little George, though not quite\r\nwithout offending Elizabeth, who thought it very hard to be desired to\r\nput away her painting instead of tantalizing her little brother with the\r\nsight of what he must not have.  Miss Fosbrook could not draw her into\r\nthe merry game with little George, which made his shouts of glee ring out\r\nthrough the house, and meet Nurse Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s ear as she came in-doors with\r\nthe baby, and calling at the school-room door, summoned him off to his\r\ntea, as if she were in a pet with Miss Fosbrook for daring to meddle with\r\none of _her_ own nursery children.\r\n\r\nNothing more was heard of the others, and Christabel and Elizabeth both\r\nread in peace till the tea-bell rang, and they went down and waited and\r\nwaited, till Miss Fosbrook accepted Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s offer of going out to call\r\nthe rest.  But Bessie returned no more than the rest; and the governess\r\nset forth herself, but had not made many steps before the voices of the\r\nrabble rout were heard, and they all were dancing and clattering about\r\nher, while Susan and Hal each carried aloft a plate containing articles\r\nonce brown, now black, and thickly powdered with white ashes, as were the\r\nchildren themselves up to their very hair.\r\n\r\nAs a slight concession to grown-up people\xe2\x80\x99s prejudices, they did, at the\r\nrisk of their dear potatoes getting cold, scamper up to perform a species\r\nof toilette, and then sat down round the tea-table, Susie, David, and Sam\r\neach vociferous that Miss Fosbrook should eat \xe2\x80\x9cmy potato that I did on\r\npurpose for her.\xe2\x80\x9d  Poor Miss Fosbrook! she would nearly as soon have\r\neaten the bonfire itself as those cinder-coated things, tough as leather\r\noutside, and within like solid smoke.  Indeed the children, who had been\r\nbathing in smoke all day, had brought in the air of it with them; but\r\ntheir tongues ran fast on their adventures, and their taste had no doubt\r\nthat their own bonfire potatoes were the most perfect cookery in art!\r\nMiss Fosbrook picked out the most eatable bits of each of the three, and\r\nmanaged to satisfy the three cooks, all zealous for their own.  Other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s potatoes might be smoky, but each one\xe2\x80\x99s own was delicious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cquite\r\nworthy of the pig when he was bought,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Miss Fosbrook; but she\r\nmade her real pleasure at the kind feeling to cover her dislike of the\r\nblack potatoes, and thus pleased the children without being untrue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLine upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is the way habits are formed and characters made; not all\r\nat once.  So there had been an opportunity for Susan to grow confirmed in\r\nher kindness and unselfishness, as well as to learn that tyranny is\r\nwrong, even on behalf of the weak; and Bessie, if she would take home the\r\nlesson, had received one in readiness to be cheerful, and to turn from\r\nher own pursuits to oblige others.  Something had been attempted toward\r\nbreaking her habit of being fretful, and thinking herself injured.  It\r\nremained to be seen whether the many little things that were yet to\r\nhappen to the two girls would be so used as to strengthen their good\r\nhabits or their bad ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is not worth while to go on describing every day at Stokesley, since\r\nlessons were far too much alike; and play-times, though varied enough for\r\nthe house of Merrifield, might be less entertaining to the readers.\r\n\r\nEnough to say, that by Saturday afternoon John had not only forfeited his\r\nlast farthing, but was charged with another into next week, for the poor\r\npleasure of leaving his hat on the school-room floor because Elizabeth\r\nhad told him of it.  At about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock it set in for rain, catching\r\nthe party at some distance from home, so that, though they made good\r\nspeed, the dust turned into mud, and clung fast to their shoes.\r\n\r\nDavid, never the best runner, was only in time to catch Johnnie by the\r\nskirt upon the third step of the staircase, crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cThe pig!\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nJohnnie, tired of the subject, and in a provoking mood, twitched away his\r\npinafore, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cBother the pig!\xe2\x80\x9d and rushed up after the four who had\r\npreceded him, leaving such lumps of dirt on the edge of every step, that\r\nwhen Miss Fosbrook came after with Elizabeth she could not but declare\r\nthat a shower was a costly article.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s such fine weather it puts one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet out of one\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Sam, Henry, and Bessie were laughing at Susan for this speech,\r\nlittle George trotted in, crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cHalty man come, Halty man come;\r\nGeorgie want sweetie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gibraltar man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John and Annie with one voice, and they were\r\nat the bottom of the stairs with a bound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, send him away, send him away.  They\xe2\x80\x99ll spend all their money, and\r\nthere will be none left!\xe2\x80\x9d was David\xe2\x80\x99s cry; while George kept dragging his\r\neldest sister\xe2\x80\x99s frock, with entreaties of \xe2\x80\x9cSusie, Susie, come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey call him the Gibraltar man, because he sells Gibraltar rock, and\r\ngingerbread, and all those things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry in explanation.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\nalways dealt with him; and he is very deserving; and his wife makes it\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94at least I know she makes ginger-beer\xe2\x80\x94so we must encourage him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Henry hastened downstairs to encourage the Gibraltar man; and Susan,\r\nsaying soothingly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Georgie;\xe2\x80\x94never mind Davie, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make up\r\nfor it; I can\xe2\x80\x99t vex him,\xe2\x80\x9d had taken the little fellow in her arms and\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPigs enough here, without sending to the fair,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Sam, please, Miss Fosbrook, send the Gibraltar man away, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t let him come,\xe2\x80\x9d cried David quite passionately.  \xe2\x80\x9cNasty man! he will\r\ncome every Saturday, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll always spend all their money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook good-humouredly, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose we have no\r\nright to banish the Gibraltar man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t wan\xe2\x80\x99t him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie; \xe2\x80\x9cit makes my fingers sticky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re no good,\xe2\x80\x9d said David vehemently.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like you, and I hate\r\nthe Gibraltar man, taking away all our money from poor Hannah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, gently, Davie; nobody makes you spend your money; and perhaps\r\nthe poor man has children of his own who want food as much as Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen can\xe2\x80\x99t they eat the Gibraltar rock and bulls\xe2\x80\x99 eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam suggested that this diet would make them sick; to which poor little\r\nearnest David answered, that when once the pig was bought, he would give\r\nall his money for a whole month to the Gibraltar man, if he would not\r\ncome for the next four weeks.\r\n\r\nAnd Christabel thought of what she had once read, that people would often\r\ngladly put away from their children friends the very trials that are sent\r\nby Heaven to prove and strengthen their will and power of resisting\r\nself-indulgence.  Before she had quite thought it out, the quick steps\r\nwere back again, and Sam greeted the entrance of John thus: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if\r\nthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t a shame!  Have you been and done Sukey out of all that, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only three bulls\xe2\x80\x99 eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, following.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou know he had\r\nnothing of his own, and it was so hard, and Annie gave him some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Nurse some,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hal.  \xe2\x80\x9cTrust Jackie for taking care of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWell he might say so, considering how full were John\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, hands, and\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Davie has had nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d said kind Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Davie!\xe2\x80\x9d holding out\r\nto him an amber-like piece of barley-sugar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want your stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d said David roughly.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve spent all away\r\nfrom the pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Davie, indeed, only twopence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cpray have a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might at least say thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\nBut how difficult is that middle road which is the only right one!\r\nDavid, being too much set on one single purpose, good though it was,\r\ncould see nothing else.  It was right and generous to abstain from sweets\r\nwith this end in view; but it was wrong to be rude and unthankful to the\r\nsister who meant all so kindly, and was the most unselfish of all.  She\r\nturned round to Elizabeth with the kind offer of the dainty she had not\r\neven tasted herself, but was not more graciously treated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you, Susie? it is all pulled about with your fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a matter on which the Misses and Masters Merrifield were not\r\nwont to be particular; and with one of the teasing laughs that Bessie\r\nhated, Sam exclaimed as Susan turned to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank you, Sukey, _I_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind finger sauce,\xe2\x80\x9d but not before John was stretching out a hand\r\nglazed with sugar, and calling out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, give it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d and as it\r\ndisappeared in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, he burst out angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cHow cross,\r\nSam!  You did that on purpose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cI did; for though pigs on four legs are all very well,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t like pigs on two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Jackie, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, seeing him about to begin to cry,\r\nand offering him her last sugar-plum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want sugar-plums, I want barley-sugar,\xe2\x80\x9d said John devouring it\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t one bit more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan regretfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had any yourself, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh then, here Susie, I always keep a reserve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not\r\nyou, Jack; I don\xe2\x80\x99t feed little pigs, whatever Susie does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of Susan, both the elder brothers set on John, teasing him\r\nabout his greediness, till he burst out crying, and ran away to the\r\nnursery.  Miss Fosbrook hated the teasing, but she thought it served John\r\nso rightly, that she would not save him from it; and she only interfered\r\nto remind the others that their fingers would bring them in for fines\r\nunless they were washed before tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much have you spent?\xe2\x80\x9d reproachfully asked that rigid young\r\njudge, David; but all the answer he got was a pull by the hair from Hal,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cHollo, young one! am I to give my accounts to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid gravely put up his hand and smoothed his ruffled locks, repeating,\r\nin his manful way, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what you have left for the pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon Hal laid hold of him, pulled him off the locker, and rolled him\r\nabout on the floor like a puppy dog, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, if you\r\nmake such a work about it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll spend all my allowance, and not subscribe\r\nat all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the tormented David, and \xe2\x80\x9cSam!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the governess, really\r\nafraid the little boy would be hurt; but Sam only stood laughing with his\r\nback to the shutter, and Christabel herself hurried to the rescue, to\r\npick Henry off his victim, holding an arm tight, while the child got up,\r\nand ran away to get his hair re-brushed for tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Hal, you might have hurt him,\xe2\x80\x9d argued the governess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good thing for him too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brothers with one voice.\r\n\r\nShe was very much shocked; but when she thought it over she perceived\r\nthat though Hal might be to blame, yet in the long run even this rough\r\ndiscipline might be more useful to her dear little David than being\r\nallowed to take upon him with his elder brothers, and grow conceited and\r\ninterfering.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook was not surprised when, next morning, a frightful bellowing\r\nwas heard instead of Johnnie being seen, and she learnt that Master John\r\nwas in the hands of Nurse Freeman, who was administering to him a dose in\r\nconsequence of his having been greatly indisposed all night.  It must be\r\nconfessed that Christabel was not very sorry to hear it, nor that Nurse\r\nwould keep him to herself all day; for bad company as Johnnie had been on\r\nthe week-days, he had been worse on the Sunday.\r\n\r\nAnd when John came out on Monday, he looked like a different boy; he had\r\nlost his fractious, rebellious look; he spoke as civilly as could be\r\nexpected of a small Merrifield, and showed no signs of being set against\r\nhis lessons.  To be sure it was a bad way of spending a Sunday, to be\r\nlaid up with ailments brought on by over-eating; but even this was better\r\nthan spending it, like the former one, in wilful misbehaviour; and John,\r\nwho knew that Papa, Mamma, brothers, and sisters all alike detested and\r\ndespised real greediness, had been heartily ashamed of himself, both for\r\nthis and his forfeits.  A new week was a new starting-point, and he meant\r\nto spend this one well.  For indeed it is one of the blessings of our\r\nlives that we have so many stages\xe2\x80\x94days, weeks, years, and the like\xe2\x80\x94from\r\neach of which we may make fresh starts, feel old things left behind, and\r\ngo on to lead a new life.\r\n\r\nBesides, Johnnie was quite well now; and perhaps no child, so well\r\nbrought up, could have been so constantly naughty the whole week without\r\nsome degree of ailment, suspected neither by himself nor others.  For\r\nthis is one of our real troubles, when either young or old, that\r\nsometimes there is a feeling of discomfort and vexation about us that,\r\nwithout knowing why, makes everything go amiss, causes everybody else to\r\nappear cross, and all tasks, all orders, all misadventures, to become\r\ngreat grievances.  Grown-up people feel this as well as children; but\r\nthey have gone through it often enough to know what is the matter, and\r\nthey have, or ought to have, more self-command.  But children have yet to\r\nlearn by experience that the outer things are not harder and more\r\nuntoward, so much as that they themselves are out of sorts.  This is poor\r\ncomfort; and certainly it is dangerous to say to ourselves that being\r\npoorly is any excuse for letting ourselves be cross, or for not doing our\r\nbest.  If Mrs. Merrifield had thought so, what miserable lives her\r\nhusband and children would have led!  No, the way to use the certain fact\r\nthat the state of our bodies affects our tempers and spirits, is to say\r\nto ourselves, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if this person or this thing do seem disagreeable,\r\nor if this work, or even this little bit of obedience, be very tiresome,\r\nperhaps it may really be only a fancy of mine, and if I go to it with a\r\ngood will, I may work off the notion;\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am cross to-day,\r\nlet me take good care how I answer.\xe2\x80\x9d  And a little prayer in our hearts\r\nwill be the best help of all.  Self-command and goodness will not come by\r\nnature as we grow up, but we must work for them in childhood.\r\n\r\nWhen the Monday allowances were brought out, and the pig\xe2\x80\x99s chance\r\ninquired into, David alone produced his whole sum, untouched by\r\nforfeiture or waste, and dropped it into \xe2\x80\x9cToby Fillpot.\xe2\x80\x9d  Elizabeth had\r\nher entire sixpence; but a penny had been spent on a letter to Mamma, and\r\nshe gave but one to the fund, in spite of the black looks she met from\r\nDavid.  Sam had lost a farthing by the shower, and had likewise bought a\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s head, to write to his father.  The rest, fourpence-three\r\nfarthings, he paid over.  Poor Johnnie! his last week\xe2\x80\x99s naughtiness had\r\nexceeded his power of paying fines, and a halfpenny was subtracted from\r\nthis week\xe2\x80\x99s threepence; while the Gibraltar man had consumed all that\r\nfines had spared to little Annie, had left Susan only threepence, and\r\nHenry but twopence-halfpenny.  This, with twopence that Miss Fosbrook had\r\nfound in her travelling-bag, made one shilling and fourpence-farthing\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nvery poor collection for one week.  David was quite melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry; \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the Colonel, is coming to\r\nstay here the last week in July, and he gives us boys half-a-sovereign\r\neach, so that we might buy a stunning pig all ourselves twice over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways?  He never did so but once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the only time he saw us, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal; \xe2\x80\x9cand we were quite\r\nlittle boys then.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Sam, he\xe2\x80\x99ll give us each a\r\nsovereign this time, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy a bow and arrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cI hope he won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate it!  I hate saying thank you; I shall get out of the way, if I\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam has no manners!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal, turning round to Miss Fosbrook.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nthink that he had rather go without a sovereign or two than say thank\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ too much of a gentleman to lay myself out for presents!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted\r\nSamuel; and the two boys fell on each other, buffeting one another, all\r\nin good part on Sam\xe2\x80\x99s side, though there was some temper and annoyance on\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nWhen Sam was out of hearing, Hal discoursed very grandly on the sovereign\r\nhe intended Colonel Carey to give him, and the prodigious things he meant\r\nto do with it.  A gentleman once gave Osmond Greville two sovereigns; why\r\nshould not Colonel Carey be equally liberal?  And to hear the boy, those\r\ntwo sovereigns would buy everything in the world, from the pig to a\r\ndouble-barrelled gun.  David began to grow hurt, and to fear the Toby\r\nfund would be lost in this magnificence; but Hal assured him that it\r\nwould be a help, and they should all have a share in the pig, promising\r\npresents to everybody, which Susan and Annie expected with the more\r\ncertainty that Sam was never present to laugh down these fine projects.\r\n\r\nIndeed Miss Fosbrook had laughed at them once or twice, and observed that\r\nshe thought money earned or spared a better thing than money given; and\r\nthis caused Hal to cease to try to dazzle her, though he could not give\r\nup the pleasure of regaling his sisters in private with the wonders to be\r\ndone with Colonel Carey\xe2\x80\x99s possible sovereigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE second week was prosperous: the treasury made progress; and\r\nChristabel began to feel as if her pupils were not beyond her management,\r\nas at first she had feared.  Collectively they were less uncouth and\r\nbearish, not so noisy at their meals, nor so needlessly rude to one\r\nanother; and the habit of teasing Elizabeth whenever there was nothing\r\nelse to do was greatly lessened.  Indeed Sam did not plague her himself,\r\nnor let his brothers do so, unless she tempted him by some very foolish\r\nwhine or bit of finery; and in such eases a little friendly merriment is\r\na sound cure, very unlike the hateful fault of tormenting for\r\ntormenting\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nNor did Elizabeth give nearly so much cause for their rough laughter,\r\nsince Miss Fosbrook had given wholesome food to her tastes and likings,\r\npartly satisfying the longing for variety, beauty, or interest which had\r\nmade her discontented and restless.  Her head was full of _her_ secret,\r\nand her pretty plans for her gift.  Such lovely drawings she saw in her\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x99s eye, such fairies, such delightful ships, kittens, babies in the\r\ncradle!  But when the pencil was in her hand, the lines went all ways but\r\nthe right; her fairy was a grimy little object, whose second wing could\r\nnever be put on; the ships were saucers; the kitten might have been the\r\npig; the baby was an owl in an ivy-bush; and to look at the live baby in\r\nthe cradle only puzzled her the more.  Miss Fosbrook gave her real\r\ndrawing lessons; but boxes, palings, and tumble-down sheds, done with a\r\nbroad black pencil, did not seem to help her to what she wished.  Yet\r\nsometimes her fingers produced what surprised and pleased herself and\r\nChristabel; and she never was happier than when safely shut into Miss\r\nFosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s bed-room with her card and her paints.  She used to bolt\r\nherself in, with a little parade of mystery that made Annie exceedingly\r\ncurious, though the others generally let it alone as \xe2\x80\x9cBetty\xe2\x80\x99s fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristabel wanted to learn botany for her own pleasure.  She found a book\r\nwhich Susan and Bessie pronounced to be horridly stupid (indeed Annie\r\ncalled it nasty, and was reproved for using such a word), but when the\r\ninformation in it was minced up small, and brought out in a new form,\r\nBessie enjoyed it extremely.  The whole party were delighted to gather\r\nflowers for Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x94the wetter or the steeper places they grew in\r\nthe better; but the boys thought it girlish to know the names; and Susan,\r\nthough liking gardening, did not in the least care for the inside of a\r\nflower.  Elizabeth, however, was charmed at the loveliness that was\r\npointed out to her; and even Annie, when the boys were not at hand,\r\nthought it very entertaining to look at petals, stamens, and pistils, and\r\nto see that a daisy is made up of a host of tiny flowers.  Both little\r\nsisters were having their eyes opened to see some of the wonder and some\r\nof the glory of this earth of ours.  It made Bessie much less often tired\r\nof everything and everybody; though after all there is but one spirit\r\nthat is certain never to be weary or dissatisfied, and into that she had\r\nyet to grow.\r\n\r\nFines were much less frequent: there were no foolish tears; only one\r\nlesson of John\xe2\x80\x99s turned back, two of Annie\xe2\x80\x99s, one of Susan\xe2\x80\x99s; some\r\nunbrushed hair of Susan\xe2\x80\x99s too\xe2\x80\x94an unlucky mention of the raven by Annie in\r\nlesson-time\xe2\x80\x94and some books left about by Sam.  Henry\xe2\x80\x99s fines were the\r\nserious ones: he had two for incorrect sums, one for elbows on the table,\r\nthree for talking, one for not putting his things away; and besides, he\r\n_could not_ go without a pennyworth of string; and the Grevilles would\r\nhave laughed at him if he had not bought some more marbles.\r\n\r\nBut what did that signify when Colonel Carey was coming? and a sovereign\r\nwould buy a pig three times over\xe2\x80\x94at least, if it was quite a little one.\r\nChristabel wished the hope of that sovereign had never occurred to him,\r\nfor he seemed to think it quite set him free from the little\r\nself-restraints by which the others were earning the pleasure of making\r\nthe gift; and though he still talked the most about the pig, he denied\r\nhimself the least for it.\r\n\r\nOne evening the boys came in with a great piece of news.  Their tutor had\r\nread in the paper that Admiral Penrose was appointed to the _Ramilies_,\r\nto take command in the Mediterranean.  He was a great friend of their\r\nfather, and, said the boys, was most likely to make him his flag-captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me a naval cadet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he would, when he was here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of you, he said,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it will be me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe looked at the rigging of my\r\nfrigate, and said I knew all the ropes quite well; and he told Papa he\r\nmight be proud of such a son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the aggrieved multitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94such a family; but he was looking at me; and I know he will give me\r\nthe appointment; and I shall sail in his ship\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.  And when I get\r\nto the Mediterranean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\xe2\x80\x94I shall kill a shark all\r\nmy own self!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA shark in the Mediterranean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they get in by the Straits of Magellan?  Oh! is that\r\nthe other place?  Well, never mind\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot the shark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff, Hal!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam rather gruffly.\r\n\r\nHal went off on another tack.  \xe2\x80\x9cWell, at least he has set me down by this\r\ntime; and Papa will have me up to London for my outfit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will have leave, and come and see us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try; but, you see, I shall be an officer on duty, and I dare say\r\nAdmiral Penrose will hardly be able to spare me; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you all\r\npresents out of my pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll spend all your pay on yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of my prize-money then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t get prize-money without a war,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t let there be a war!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but there is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry in a tremendous tone; and as Miss\r\nFosbrook held up her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cat least there was one in the Black Sea; and\r\nI know there was a battle in the newspaper\xe2\x80\x94at least, Mr. Carey read about\r\nPalermo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Garibaldi in Sicily will put much prize-money into your\r\npocket, Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but there\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be a war! and I shall get promoted, and be a man\r\nbefore any of you.  I shall go about, and see condors, and lions, and\r\nelephants, and wear a sword\xe2\x80\x94at least, a dirk\xe2\x80\x94while you are learning Latin\r\nand Greek at Uncle John\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make such a noise about it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam crossly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you should be the one to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.  \xe2\x80\x9cSam is\r\nthe eldest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but Sam is such a slow-coach.  Papa said I was the only one fit to\r\nmake a sailor of\xe2\x80\x94at least, he said I was smart, and\xe2\x80\x94Hollo!  Sam, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave you kicking my legs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t keep up such a row then!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sam; but Hal was in too full\r\nswing to be reached by slight measures.  He pushed his chair back, tucked\r\nup his feet like a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s, out of reach, and went on: \xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall\r\ncome home in my cocked hat, like Papa\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94at least, my cap\xe2\x80\x94and come and ask\r\nfor a holiday for you all at Uncle John\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncle John was an under-master at one of the great public schools, and\r\nthe children were all a good deal in awe of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle John won\xe2\x80\x99t give one for _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, boys, I can\xe2\x80\x99t have this bickering,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.  \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee you trying which can be most provoking.  Stand up.  Now, David, say\r\ngrace.  There, Annie, finish that bit of bread out of doors.  Go out, and\r\nlet us have no more of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke now with much less fear of not being minded; and having seen\r\none of the quarrelsome parties safe out of the school-room, she went to\r\nfetch from her own room a glove that wanted mending; and on her return\r\nfound Sam alone there, curled up over his lesson-books on the locker,\r\nlooking so gloomy, that she was afraid she had made him sulky, for which\r\nshe would have been very sorry, since she had a respect for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked; and his \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x9d did not at all assure\r\nher that he was in a right mood.  She doubted whether to leave him alone;\r\nbut presently thought he looked more unhappy than ill-tempered, and\r\nventured to speak.  \xe2\x80\x9cHave you a hard piece to learn?  Perhaps I could\r\nhelp you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe let her come and look at his book; but, to her surprise, he had before\r\nhim a very easy problem in Euclid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, if you only gave your mind to this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would soon\r\nmake it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all along of that, and the rest of\r\nit, that I have got to be a land-lubber!\xe2\x80\x9d and he threw the book to the\r\nother end of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no chance?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, without taking notice of this\r\nrudeness, for she saw that the boy could hardly contain himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!  The Admiral did take notice of Hal; and one day when I was slow at\r\na proposition, my father said I was too block-headed to beat navigation\r\ninto, and that Hal is a smart fellow, worth two of me.  I know he is!  I\r\nknow that; only if he would not make such an intolerable crowing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you wish it very much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish it!  Of course I do.  Why, my father is a sailor; and I remember\r\nthe _Fury_, and I saw the _Calliope_\xe2\x80\x94his ship that he had in the war\r\ntime.  Before I was as big as little George I always thought I should be\r\na sailor.  And now if Papa goes out with Admiral Penrose, and Hal too\xe2\x80\x94oh!\r\nit will be so horrid home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can\xe2\x80\x99t you both go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; my father said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask to have two of us put down, unless\r\nperhaps some younger one had a chance by and by.  And Hal is the\r\nsharpest, and does everything better than I can when he has a mind.  My\r\nfather says, among so many all can\xe2\x80\x99t choose; and if this place is to be\r\nmine, Hal may want to be in the navy more than I.  Yes, it is all right,\r\nand Hal must go.  But\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94when my father is gone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and Sam fairly burst\r\nout crying.  \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly know how different it is with him away till\r\nthis month.  I was such a little fellow when he went to the Black Sea;\r\nbut now\xe2\x80\x94never mind, though!\xe2\x80\x9d and he stamped his foot on the floor.  \xe2\x80\x9cPapa\r\nsaid it, and it must be.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell the others, Miss Fosbrook;\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nresolutely went and picked up his Euclid, and began finding the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do your duty like a man, wherever you are, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChristabel heartily.\r\n\r\nSam looked as if he had rather that she had not said it, but it was\r\ncomfortable to him for all that; and though she kept further compliments\r\nto herself, she could not but think that there was no fear but that he\r\nwould be a man, in the best sense of the word, before Hal, when she saw\r\nhim so manfully put his sore grievance out of his head, and turn to the\r\npresent business of conquering his lesson.  Nor did she hear another word\r\nfrom him about his disappointment.\r\n\r\nIt made her dislike Henry\xe2\x80\x99s boasts more than ever; and she used to cut\r\nthem short as fast as she could, till the young chatterer decided that\r\nshe was \xe2\x80\x9ccross,\xe2\x80\x9d and reserved all his wonderful \xe2\x80\x9cat leasts\xe2\x80\x9d for his\r\nsisters, and his proofs of manliness for the Grevilles.\r\n\r\nThe Gibraltar man did not come on Saturday; and Miss Fosbrook had been\r\nthe saving of several stamps by sending some queer little letters in her\r\nown to Mrs. Merrifield, so that on Monday morning the hoard was increased\r\nto seven-and-sixpence; although between fines and \xe2\x80\x9c_couldn\xe2\x80\x99t helps_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s sixpence had melted down to a halfpenny, which \xe2\x80\x9cwas not worth\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this day arrived a servant from the Park, bringing a delicate little\r\nlilac envelope, stamped with a tiny rose, and directed to Miss\r\nMerrifield.  There was another rose on the top of the lilac paper; and\r\nthe writing was in a very neat hand.\r\n\r\n    My dear Susan,\r\n\r\n    Mamma desires me to say that she hopes you and Bessie and Annie will\r\n    come to dine early to-morrow, and play with me, and that Miss Fosbury\r\n    will come with you.  She hopes your Mamma is better, and would be\r\n    glad to have her address in London.\r\n\r\n                                                    I am your affectionate\r\n                                                    IDA ARABELLA GREVILLE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  Miss Fosbrook, may we go?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girls with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrifield had written that one or two such invitations might be\r\naccepted, but she had rather it did not happen too often, as visits at\r\nthe Park were unsettling to some of the children.  So as this was the\r\nfirst, Christabel gladly consented, rather curious and rather shy on her\r\nown account.\r\n\r\nElizabeth begged for the rose, to copy it, and as there were no little\r\nones present to seize it, she was allowed to have it; while Susan groaned\r\nand sighed over the misfortune of having to write a \xe2\x80\x9chorrible note\xe2\x80\x9d just\r\nat play-time; and the boys treated it as a sort of insult to the whole\r\nfamily that Ida should have mistaken their governess\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her you won\xe2\x80\x99t go till she has it right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; at which Annie\r\nmade a vehement outcry of \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d such as made them all laugh at her\r\nthinking him in earnest.\r\n\r\nSusan\xe2\x80\x99s note began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    My dear Ida,\r\n\r\n    We shuold\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBut then perceiving that something was the matter with her word, Susan\r\nsat and looked at it, till at last, perceiving that her _u_ and _o_ had\r\nchanged places, she tried putting a top to the _u_, and made it like an\r\n_a_; while the filling up the _o_ made it become a blot, such as caught\r\nBessie\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Susie, you won\xe2\x80\x99t send such a thing as that up to Ida?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94that _would_ be a \xe2\x80\x98horrible note,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said her governess; and she ruled\r\nthe lines again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t one send a message up by the\r\nman that we\xe2\x80\x99ll all come, without this fuss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Miss Fosbrook said that would be very uncivil; and Susan, groaning,\r\nstretched every finger till the lines were finished, and began again, in\r\nher scraggy round-hand\xe2\x80\x94getting safely through the \xe2\x80\x9cshould,\xe2\x80\x9d and also\r\nthrough \xe2\x80\x9clike to come very much;\xe2\x80\x9d but when Miss Fosbrook looked up next,\r\nshe saw that the rest of the note consisted of\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    Mamma is at Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s, No. 12,\xe2\x80\x94St., Grovensor Place.\r\n\r\n                                                    I am your affectionate\r\n                                                       SUSANNA MERRIFIELD.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I am very sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! won\xe2\x80\x99t that do?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Susan, beginning to get into despair.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook pointed to the word \xe2\x80\x9cGrovensor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! oh dear!  I thought I had got that tiresome word this time.\r\nWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t it put its _ss_ and _ns_ into their proper sensible places?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried poor Susan, to whom it was a terrible enemy.  She used to try them\r\nin different places all the way round, in hopes that one might at last be\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you remember what I told you, that the first Grosvenor was the\r\ngrand huntsman?  _Grosveneur_ in French; that would show you where to put\r\nthe _s\xe2\x80\x94gros_, great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Susan never wished to remember anything French; and Sam observed that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe man deserved to be spelt wrong if he called himself by a French\r\nname.  Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he be content to be Mr. Grandhunter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as he is not, we must spell his name right, or Mrs. Greville will be\r\nshocked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease can\xe2\x80\x99t you scratch it out?\xe2\x80\x9d said the disconsolate Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ should not like to send a note with a scratch in it.  Besides, yours\r\nis hardly civil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you know how people answer\r\ninvitations, Susie?  I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you.  \xe2\x80\x98Miss Susanna, and Miss Elizabeth,\r\nand Miss Annie Merrifield will be very happy to do the honour of dining\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 Sam, why do you laugh at me always?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are telling Ida you will do her honour by dining with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople always do honour when they dine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know they\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey profess to receive the honour, not confer it, Bessie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nFosbrook, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is the model for Susie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnote.  It would be as much too formal as hers was too blunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I do it again?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cI had rather not go, if it is to be\r\nsuch a plague.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I fear you must, Susie.  It is quite needful to learn how to\r\nwrite a respectable note; really a more difficult thing than writing a\r\nlong letter.  I am sorry for you; but if you were not so careless in your\r\nletters to Mamma this would come more easily to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this time Miss Fosbrook not only ruled another sheet, but wrote, in\r\nfair large-hand on a slate, the words, that Susan might copy them without\r\nfresh troubles:\r\n\r\n    We are much obliged to your Mamma for her kind invitation, and shall\r\n    have much pleasure in coming with Miss Fosbrook to dine with you and\r\n    spend the day.  I am sorry to say that Mamma was not quite so well\r\n    when last we heard.  Her address is\xe2\x80\x94No. 12,\xe2\x80\x94St., Grosvenor-place.\r\n\r\nSusan thought that here were a very serious number of words, and begged\r\nhard for leave to leave out her sorrow.  Of course she was sorry, but\r\nwhat was the use of telling Ida so?\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook thought it looked better, but Susan might do as she\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it only to look\r\nbetter to Ida.\xe2\x80\x9d  With which words he and Hal walked off to the garden.\r\n\r\nWould it be believed?  Susan, in her delight at being near the end,\r\nforgot the grand huntsman, and made the unlucky Place \xe2\x80\x9cGrovesnor,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen, in her haste to mend it, put her finger into the wet ink, and\r\nsmeared not only that word, but all the line above!\r\n\r\nIt was a shame and a wonder that a girl of her age should be so incapable\r\nof producing a creditable note; and Miss Fosbrook was very near scolding\r\nher but she had pity on the tearful eyes and weary fingers, and spoke\r\ncheerfully: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, that was almost the thing.  One more trial, Susan,\r\nand you need never be afraid of Ida\xe2\x80\x99s notes again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Susan could not write notes, at least she was not cross; and it would\r\nbe well if many who could send off a much better performance with far\r\nless difficulty could go to work as patiently as she did, without one\r\npettish word to Miss Fosbrook, though that lady seemed to poor Susie as\r\nhard a task mistress as if she could have helped it.  This time Miss\r\nFosbrook authorized the leaving out of the spending the day, and\r\nsuggested that S. would be enough without the whole Susanna, and she\r\nmercifully directed the cover to Miss Greville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, my dear, you have worked hard for your pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as\r\nSusan extended each hand to its broadest stretch to uncramp them, and\r\nstretched herself backwards as if she wanted to double her head down to\r\nher heels.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall give you a good mark, Susie, as if it had been a\r\nlesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan deserved it, for her patient perseverance had been all out of\r\nobedience, not in the mere desire of having her note admired.  Indeed,\r\ngood child, at the best it was a very poor affair for a girl of twelve,\r\nand Miss Fosbrook was ashamed of it when she looked at Ida\xe2\x80\x99s lady-like\r\nlittle billet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I shall feel as if I would\r\nchange my dear stupid Susan for Miss Ida?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Susan flew screaming and leaping out into the garden in a mad\r\ntom-boy fashion; but that could well be pardoned, as there were only her\r\nsisters to see her; and the pleasure of having persevered and done her\r\nbest was enough to make her heart and her limbs dance for merriment.\r\n\r\nDepend upon it, however wretched and miserable hard application to what\r\nwe do not like may seem at the moment, it is the only way to make\r\nplay-times really delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS FOSBROOK soon knew what Mrs. Merrifield meant by saying that visits\r\nat the Park unsettled the children.  Susan indeed, though liking anything\r\nthat shortened lessons by an hour, and made a change, was not so fond of\r\nbeing on her good behaviour at the Park as to be greatly exalted at the\r\nprospect; but Elizabeth and Annie were changed beings.  They were\r\nconstantly breaking out with some new variety of wonder.  They wondered\r\nwhether they should dine in the school-room, or at Mrs. Greville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nluncheon; they wondered if Mr. Greville would speak to them; they\r\nwondered whether Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Munsterthal would be cross; they wondered if\r\nIda still played with dolls; and they looked as if they thought\r\nthemselves wonderful, too, for going out for a day!\r\n\r\nNay, the wonders were at their tongues\xe2\x80\x99 end even when lessons began, and\r\nput their farthings in great peril; and when they had nothing else to\r\nwonder at, they wondered when it would be twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and took no\r\npains to swallow enormous yawns.  Once, over her copy, Elizabeth\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cNow! yes, this is necessary, Miss Fosbrook!  May not we wear\r\nour white frocks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not ironed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do let me go and tell Mary!  There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, who\r\nhad lately thought it cruel of the clock to point only to half-past ten,\r\nand never bethought herself how Mary would like to be called off from her\r\nscrubbing to iron three white frocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould your Mamma wish it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Christabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no,\xe2\x80\x9d was Susan\xe2\x80\x99s answer; \xe2\x80\x9cwe always wear clean ones of our\r\nevery-day frocks.  Our white ones are only for dinner-parties and\r\nChristmas-trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie grumbled.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow cross!  I hate those nasty old spotty cottons;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand Johnnie returned to the old story\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLittle vain pussy-cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp went Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s warning pencil, she shook her head, and held out\r\nher hand for two fines.  Elizabeth began to gulp and sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t, Betty!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cStop while you can.  You won\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\ngoing up with red eyes.  There, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay your fine; and there\xe2\x80\x99s another\r\nfor my speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Susie; that was not foolish speaking, but kind words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nFosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cbut no more now; go on, Annie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Annie, who was reading a little history of St. Paul, would call\r\nCilicia, Cicilia, and when told to spell it she began to cry too\r\ndecidedly for Susan\xe2\x80\x99s good-nature to check her tears.  And not only did\r\nElizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s copy look as if she had written it with claws instead of\r\nfingers, but she was grieving over her spotted cotton instead of really\r\nseeking for places in her map.  Thus the Moselle obstinately hid itself;\r\nand she absolutely shed tears because Miss Fosbrook declared that\r\nFrankfort _was_ on the Maine.  For the first time she had her grammar\r\nturned back upon her hands.  How many mistakes Annie made would be really\r\npast telling; for these two little girls had their whole minds quite\r\nupset by the thought of a day\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure; and as they never tried to\r\nrestrain themselves, and to \xe2\x80\x9cbe sober, be vigilant,\xe2\x80\x9d they gave way before\r\nall the little trials in their paths\xe2\x80\x94were first careless, and then\r\nfractious.  Perhaps when they were older they would find out that this\r\nuplifted sense of excited expectation is the very warning to be heedful.\r\n\r\nIf Miss Fosbrook had been a strict governess, she would have told them\r\nthey did not deserve to go at all; or at any rate, that Bessie must\r\nrepeat her grammar better, and re-write her copy, and that Annie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunlucky addition sum must be made to prove; but she had seen her little\r\nsisters nearly as bad in prospect of a pantomime, so she was merciful,\r\nand sent them in good time to brush their hair, put on their spotted\r\ncottons, and wash off as much as possible of the red mottling left by\r\nthose foolish tears.\r\n\r\nTheir spirits rose again as fast as they had sunk; and it was a lively\r\nwalk through the park to the great house, with a good deal of skipping\r\nand jumping at first, and then, near the door, a little awe and gravity.\r\n\r\nThey were taken through a side-door of the hall to the school-room, where\r\nIda and her governess received them.  It was the first time that\r\nChristabel had seen her out of her beplumed hat, and she thought her a\r\npleasant, bright-looking little girl, not at all set up or conceited.\r\nHer mauve muslin, flounced though it was up to her waist, showed that it\r\nhad been wise to withstand Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s desire for the white muslins; but\r\nMiss Fosbrook had enough to do on her own account with the endeavour to\r\nunderstand the German governess\xe2\x80\x99s foreign accent, without attending to\r\nthe children more than was necessary.\r\n\r\nIt was not a very remarkable day, and the pleasures of it seemed hardly\r\nenough to justify the little girls\xe2\x80\x99 great excitement.  There was first\r\nthe dinner at the luncheon of the parents, where the children sat up\r\nrather formal and subdued, and not quite certain what all the dishes\r\nmight contain, a little afraid of getting what they _could_ not eat,\r\nthough desirous of making experiments in this land of wonders.  None of\r\nthem had forgotten, and they thought no one else had, how Bessie had once\r\ncome to disgrace by bursting out crying over the impossibility of\r\nfinishing some terrible rice-bordered greenish yellow stuff that burnt\r\nher mouth beyond bearing, and which Ida called curry, and said people in\r\nthe East Indies liked.  However, that was when Bessie had been a very\r\nlittle girl; and she still continued adventurous, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you\r\nplease,\xe2\x80\x9d to cutlets set round in a wreath, with all their bones sticking\r\nup, and covered with a reddish incrustation that Susan and Annie thought\r\nso unnatural, that they preferred the boiled chicken that at least they\r\ncould understand, though it had funny-hooking accompaniments in the\r\nsauce.  And Hal\xe2\x80\x99s report of some savoury jelly which he had once\r\nencountered would have deterred them from the pink transparency in the\r\nshape of a shell, if they had not seen Bessie getting on very well with\r\nit, Miss Fosbrook happily perceiving and cutting short Annie\xe2\x80\x99s intended\r\ninquiry whether it were nice.  To her great relief, this was the only\r\nwant of manners betrayed by her little savages, and she was able to keep\r\nher attention tolerably free from them, so as to look at the pictures on\r\nthe walls, observe the two boys, Hal\xe2\x80\x99s friends, and talk to Mrs.\r\nGreville, who made conversation with her very pleasantly.\r\n\r\nShe was much grieved to perceive, from what that lady said, that Mrs.\r\nMerrifield was thought to be much more ill, and in a far more alarming\r\nstate, than she had at all understood.  The girls were too young to enter\r\ninto the tone of sad sympathy with which Mrs. Greville spoke, and the\r\nmanner in which a doubt was expressed whether the Captain would be able\r\nto sail with Admiral Penrose if he should have the offer; and as soon as\r\nshe saw that they and their governess were in ignorance, she turned it\r\noff; but she had said enough to fill Christabel with anxiety and desire\r\nto know more; and as soon as the dinner was over, and the little girls\r\nhad run off together to visit Ida\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful cockatoo in the\r\nconservatory, she turned to Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Munsterthal, and begged to hear\r\nwhether she knew more than had been said.\r\n\r\nFr\xc3\xa4ulein Munsterthal did not quite know that such a person as Mrs.\r\nMerrifield was in existence; but she was very amiable and warm-hearted,\r\nand said how sad it was to think of the trouble that hung over \xe2\x80\x9cthese so\r\ncareless children,\xe2\x80\x9d and was doubly kind to the girls when they came back\r\nfrom their conversation with pretty \xe2\x80\x9cCocky,\xe2\x80\x9d who set up his\r\nlemon-coloured crest, coughed, sneezed, and said \xe2\x80\x9cCocky want a biscuit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto admiration, till the boys were seen approaching; when Ida, knowing\r\nthat some torment would follow, took herself and her visitors back to the\r\nprotection of the governesses in time to prevent the cockatoo from being\r\nmade to fly at the girls, and powder them with the white dust under his\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was spent in the garden, the little girls betaking\r\nthemselves to a pretty moss-covered arbour, where there was a grand\r\ndoll\xe2\x80\x99s feast.  Ida had no less than twenty-three dolls, ranging from the\r\nmagnificent Rosalind, who had real hair that could be brushed, and was as\r\nlarge as little Sally at home, down to poor little china Mildred, whose\r\nproper dwelling-place was a bath, and who had with great difficulty been\r\nput into petticoats enough to make her fit to be seen out of it.  Now\r\nnobody at home could have saved the life of a doll for a single day, and\r\nSusan and Elizabeth were both thought far above them; but these\r\nbeautifully arrayed young ladies had always been the admiration of the\r\nheart of Bessie as well as of Annie, and they were not too old for\r\nextreme satisfaction in handling their elegant ladyships, and still more\r\ntheir beautiful dinner and tea-service of pink and white ware.\r\n\r\nSusan, though she could not write a note, or do lessons like Ida, was\r\nolder in the ways of life, and played rather as she did with the little\r\nones at home than for her own amusement.  She would much rather have had\r\nthe fun of \xe2\x80\x9ccats and mice\xe2\x80\x9d with her brothers; and but for the honour of\r\nthe thing, so perhaps would Annie.  However, they were all very happy,\r\ngetting the dolls up in the morning, giving Mildred washing enough for\r\nall the twenty-three, making them breakfast, hearing lessons, in which\r\nIda was governess, and made them talk so many languages that Annie was\r\nalarmed.  Of course one of the young ladies was very naughty, and was\r\ntreated with extreme severity; then there was dinner, a walk, an illness,\r\nand a dinner-party.  While all the time the two real governesses sat in\r\nthe shade outside, and talked in English or German as best they might,\r\nthe Fr\xc3\xa4ulein understanding Christabel\xe2\x80\x99s English the best, as did\r\nChristabel the Fr\xc3\xa4ulein\xe2\x80\x99s German.  They began to make friends, and to\r\nwish to see more of one another.\r\n\r\nThere was a walk round the garden, and admiration of the beautiful\r\nflowers, and the fountain and pond of gold-fish, till the boys came home,\r\nand got hold of the garden-engine for watering, crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cFire! fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand squirting out the showers of water very much in the direction of the\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nIda became quite crimson red, and got hold of Susan\xe2\x80\x99s hand to drag her\r\naway; then, as the foremost drops of another shower touched her, she\r\nfaced about, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOsmond! don\xe2\x80\x99t, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d  There was a\r\ngreat rude laugh, as of boys who well knew the threat was never put in\r\nexecution; and poor Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Munsterthal only shook her head at Miss\r\nFosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s look of amaze, and said in German that \xe2\x80\x9c_die Knaben_\xe2\x80\x9d were far\r\ntoo _unartig_ for her to keep in order.  She pitied Miss Fosbrook for\r\nhaving so many in charge as to destroy all peace.  And if Sam and Hal had\r\nbeen like these two, Christabel felt that she could have done nothing\r\nwith them.  To her dismay, Osmond and Martin came in to the school-room\r\ntea; and she never had thought to feel so thankful for poor dear Susan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslowness of comprehension, for, from their whispers among themselves, and\r\nfrom their poor tormented sister\xe2\x80\x99s blushes, she was clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cfire\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas a piece of bad wit on Susan\xe2\x80\x99s red hair.  Boys who could so basely\r\ninsult a guest, and that a girl, she was sure must be bad companions for\r\nSam and Henry.  Such little gentlemen as they had been at dinner too, so\r\npolite and well-behaved before their father and mother!  There could be\r\nno doubt that something must be very wrong about them, or they would not\r\nchange so entirely when out of sight.  It is not always true that a child\r\nmust be deceitful who is less good in the absence of the authorities;\r\nbecause their presence is a help and a restraint, checking the beginning\r\nof mischief, and removing temptation; but one who does not fall by\r\nweakness, but intentionally alters his conduct the instant the elder is\r\ngone, shows that his will has been disobedient all along.\r\n\r\nBy and by Mr. Greville\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard calling, \xe2\x80\x9cMartin!  Osmond!\xe2\x80\x9d As\r\nthey went out to meet him in the passage, Miss Fosbrook clearly\r\noverheard, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the spring of the garden-engine spoilt.  Do you know\r\nanything about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not been meddling with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d  And they ran downstairs.\r\n\r\nThe colour flushed into Christabel\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks with horror.  She was glad\r\nthat her little girls were all in Ida\xe2\x80\x99s room, listening to a musical-box,\r\nand well out of hearing of such fearfully direct falsehoods, as it seemed\r\nto her, not knowing that the boys excused it to their own minds by the\r\nnotion that it was not the _spring_ of the engine that they had been\r\nmeddling with, and that so they did not know how the harm had been\r\ndone\xe2\x80\x94as if it made it any better that they lied to themselves as well as\r\ntheir father!  The German saw her dismay, and began to say how unlike her\r\nIda was to her brothers\xe2\x80\x94so truthful, so gentle, and courteous; but poor\r\nChristabel could not get over the thought of the ease and readiness with\r\nwhich deceit came to these boys.  Could their daily companions, Samuel\r\nand Henry, have learnt the same effrontery, and be deceiving her all this\r\ntime?  No, no, she could not, would not think it!  Assuredly not of Sam!\r\nShe was very glad not to see the boys again, and went home with her\r\npupils, rather heavy-hearted, at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, just as Ida was to put on\r\nher white muslin and pink ribbons, and go down after dinner for half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThere were many kisses at parting, and a whole box of sweets, done up in\r\nbeautifully coloured and gold and silver paper, presented to the little\r\nvisitors; but it might be supposed that the girls were tired, for there\r\nwas a fretful snarling all the way across the park, because Elizabeth\r\ninsisted that the gifts should be called _bon-bons_, and the others would\r\nhear of nothing but goodies.  Nobody looked at the beautiful evening sky,\r\nnor at the round red moon coming up like a lamp behind the trees, nor at\r\nthe first stars peeping out, nor even at the green light of the\r\nglow-worm\xe2\x80\x94all which were more beautiful than anything Ida had shown them,\r\nexcept perhaps the hothouse flowers; and at last two such cross\r\nill-tempered voices sounded from Bessie and Annie, that Christabel turned\r\nround and declared that she should not let the sugar-plums be touched for\r\na week if another word were said about them.\r\n\r\nShe hoped that when the visit was over it would be done with; but no such\r\nthing.  Though Susan was her own good hearty self, Elizabeth had not\r\nrecovered either on that day of the next from the effects of the\r\npleasuring.  On each she cried over her lessons, and was cross at\r\nwhatever the boys said to her, made a fuss about keeping the ornamental\r\ncases of the _bon-bons_, and went about round-backed, peevish, and\r\ndiscontented, finding everything flat and ugly after her one peep at the\r\nluxuries of the Park.  Her farthings melted away fast; but she seemed to\r\nthink this her misfortune, not her fault.  She did not try to talk to\r\nMiss Fosbrook, feeling perhaps that she was in a naughty mood, which she\r\nwould not try to shake off; and she made no attempt to go on with her\r\npresent for her Mamma, it looked so poor and trumpery after the beautiful\r\nthings she had seen.\r\n\r\nNor did Christabel like to remind her of it, fearing that the occasion\r\nfor giving it might never come; but she did feel that it was a mournful\r\nthing to see the child, who was in danger of so fearful a sorrow, wasting\r\nher grief in pining after foolish fancies, and turning what should have\r\nbeen a refreshing holiday into an occasion of longing after what she thus\r\nmade into pomps and vanities of this wicked world.  Christabel had heard\r\nthat people who murmur among blessings often have those blessings\r\nsnatched away, and this made her tremble for poor little discontented\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHERE!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cI really have got a letter from Papa himself.\r\nWhat a prize!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to mind your Grosvenor when you answer _him_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut hollo, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Susan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had grown large, and her whole face scarlet, and she\r\ngave a little cry as she read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Mamma, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mamma\xe2\x80\x94Mamma is so very ill!\xe2\x80\x9d and Susan throw the letter down, and\r\nbroke into a fit of sobbing.\r\n\r\nSam caught it up, and Elizabeth came to read it with him, both standing\r\nstill and not speaking a word, but staring at the letter with their eyes\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, tenderly putting her arm round\r\nSusan; but she sobbed too much to make a word distinct, and Bessie held\r\nout the letter to her governess, looking white, and too much awed to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nCaptain Merrifield wrote in short, plain, sad words, that he thought it\r\nright that his children should know how matters stood.  The doctors\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntreatment, for which their mother had been taken to London, had not\r\nsucceeded, but had occasioned such terrible illness, that unless by the\r\nmercy of God she became much better in the course of a day or two, she\r\ncould not live.  If she should be worse, he would either write or\r\ntelegraph, and Susan and Sam must be ready to set out at once on the\r\nreceipt of such a message, and come up by the next train to London, where\r\nthey should be met at the station.  He had promised their mother that in\r\ncase of need he would send for them.\r\n\r\n    God bless you, my poor children, and have mercy on us all!\r\n\r\n                                                       Your loving father,\r\n                                                            H. MERRIFIELD.\r\n\r\nThat was all; and Christabel felt, more than even the children did, from\r\nhow full and heavy a heart those words had been written.\r\n\r\nThough she hardly knew how to speak, she tried to comfort Susan by\r\nshowing her that her father had evidently not given up all hope; but\r\nSusan was crying more at the thought of her Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s present illness and\r\npain than with fear of the future; and Sam said sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cHe would not have\r\nwritten at all unless it had been very bad indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I believe, in cases like this, there is\r\noften great fear, and then very speedy improvement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, speaking for the first time, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it will be.\r\nLittle girls in story-books always do have their mammas\xe2\x80\x94die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStory-books are all nonsense, so it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; and really\r\nit seemed as if the habit of contradicting Bessie had suggested to him\r\nthe greatest consolation that had yet occurred.\r\n\r\nJust then Henry and the younger ones came in, and learnt the tidings.\r\nHenry wept as bitterly as his elder sister, and John and Annie both did\r\nthe same; but David did not speak one word, as if he hardly took in what\r\nwas the matter, and, going to the window, took up his lesson-books as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we can\xe2\x80\x99t go to Mr. Carey to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we shall,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose a telegraph should come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then you can send for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Hal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry crossly; \xe2\x80\x9cI know Mr. Carey will give us\r\nleave when he knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to kick up a row, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo if you stay at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, if the message comes, I shall take Susie to London instead of\r\nyou.  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they want me most!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, go down to Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s with your brother, if you please, Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiss Fosbrook decidedly.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf he should tell you not to stay, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it; but you will none of you do any good by hanging about without\r\ndoing your daily duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHal saw he had no chance, and marched off, muttering about its being very\r\nhard.  Sam picked up his books, and turned to go, with a grave steady\r\nlook that was quite manly in its sadness, only stopping to say, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nJackie, you be good!\xe2\x80\x94Please Miss Fosbrook, let him run down after me if\r\nthe message comes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back before the horse is out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook promised, and could not help shaking hands with the brave\r\nboy, if only to show that she felt with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen must we all do our lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Annie disconsolately, when he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear; I think we shall all be the better for not neglecting what\r\nwe ought to do.  But there is one thing that we can do for your dear\r\nMamma; you know what I mean.  Suppose you each went away alone for five\r\nminutes, and were to come back when I ring the little bell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first to come back was Annie, with the question in a low whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook, will God make Mamma better if we are very good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook kissed her, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear little girl, I cannot tell.\r\nAll I can certainly tell you is, that He hears the prayers of good\r\nchildren, and if it be better for her and for you He will give her back\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnnie did not quite understand, but she entered into what Miss Fosbrook\r\nsaid enough to wish to be good; so she took up her book, and began to\r\nlearn with all her might.\r\n\r\nElizabeth would have thought it much more like a little girl in a book to\r\nhave done no lessons, but have sat thinking, and perhaps reading the\r\nBible all day; but on the whole Elizabeth had hardly thoughts enough to\r\nlast her so long; nor was she deep or serious enough to have done herself\r\nmuch good by keeping the Bible open before her.  In fact she did lose her\r\nverse in merely reading the chapter for the day!  So it was just as well\r\nthat she had something to do that was not play, and that was a duty, and\r\nthus might give the desire to be good something to bear upon.\r\n\r\nBut Christabel saw by Susan\xe2\x80\x99s face, and heard in the shaken voice with\r\nwhich she took her turn in the reading, that she could not have given her\r\nmind to her tasks, and did not need them to keep her out of mischief.  It\r\nwould have been cruel to have required her to sit down to them just then,\r\nand her governess was glad to be able to excuse her on account of the\r\npacking-up.  All her things and Sam\xe2\x80\x99s must be got ready in case of an\r\nimmediate start, and she was sent up to the nursery to take care of the\r\nlittle ones, while Nurse and Mary mended, ironed, and packed.\r\n\r\nTo be sure Nurse Freeman made poor Susan unnecessarily unhappy by being\r\nsure that it was all the fault of the London doctors; but she was a kind,\r\ntender old woman, and her petting was a great comfort to the poor girl.\r\nWhat did her most good, however, was sitting quite quiet with the little\r\nones while they were asleep, and all alone; it seemed to rest and compose\r\nher, and she always loved to be in charge of them.  Poor child! she might\r\nsoon have to be their little mother!  She was able to play with them when\r\nthey awoke, and cheered herself up with their pretty ways, and by finding\r\nhow quickly Baby was learning to walk.  Ah! but would Mamma ever see her\r\nwalk?\r\n\r\nIf any of the children thought it unjust that Susan\xe2\x80\x99s lessons should be\r\nlet off, they were wrong.  Parents and teachers must have the power of\r\ndoing such things without being judged.  Sometimes they see that a child\r\nis really unable to learn, when the others perceive no difference; and it\r\nwould be very harsh and cruel to oppress one who is out of order for fear\r\nlittle silly, idle, healthy things should think themselves hardly used.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the lessons were capitally done; and when the children met\r\nagain, they were all so much brighter and more hopeful, that they quite\r\nbelieved that their Mamma was going to get better very fast.  Bessie\r\nespecially was so resolved that thus it should be, that she shut herself\r\ninto Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s room, and drew and painted with all her might, as if\r\npreparing for Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s birthday made it certain that it would be kept.\r\n\r\nThe boys brought word that they would have a holiday the next day, as it\r\nwas the Feast of St. Barnabas, and after morning service Mr. Carey was\r\ngoing to meet his brother and bring him home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be all the more certain to get the sovereign, or two\r\nsovereigns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry to David, the only person whom he could find to\r\nlisten to him, \xe2\x80\x9cif Sam is gone; and everyone will be caring about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to the pig,\xe2\x80\x9d said David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, to be sure.  You will grow into a pig yourself if you go on that\r\nway, David.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, David, partaking the family distrust of Hal\xe2\x80\x99s birds-in-the-bush,\r\nand being started on the subject of the hoard, ran up to Sam, who was\r\nlearning his lessons by way of something to do, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go to\r\nLondon, Sam, may I have your sixpence on Monday for the pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I am going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you do\xe2\x80\x94or we sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t get the pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you care if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get the pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  Be off with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid next betook himself to his eldest sister, who was trying to write\r\nto her father, and finding such a letter harder and sadder work than that\r\nto Ida Greville, though no one teased her about writing, blots, or\r\nspelling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you go to London, Susie,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in the very same words, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I\r\nhave your sixpence on Monday for the pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Davie, don\xe2\x80\x99t be tiresome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid only said it over again in the same words, and put his hand down on\r\nher letter in his earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away, Davie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t tease your sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want her to say I may have her sixpence on Monday for the pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan angrily; \xe2\x80\x9cyou care for the nasty pig\r\nmore than for poor Mamma or anyone else, and you sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo seldom did Susan say anything cross, that everyone looked up\r\nsurprised.  Miss Fosbrook saw that it was sheer unhappiness that made her\r\nspeak sharply, and would not take any notice, except by gently taking\r\naway the pertinacious David.\r\n\r\nHe was very much distressed at the refusal; and when Miss Fosbrook told\r\nhim that his brother and sister could not think of such things when they\r\nwere in such trouble, he only answered, \xe2\x80\x9cBut Hannah Higgins won\xe2\x80\x99t get her\r\npig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook was vexed herself that her friend David should seem\r\npossessed with this single idea, as if it shut out all others from his\r\nmind.  He was consoled fast enough; for Susan, with another great sob,\r\nthrew down her pen, and coming up to stroke him down with her inky\r\nfingers, cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cO Davie, Davie, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I\r\nsaid it.  You shall have my sixpence, or anything!  But, oh dear, I wish\r\nthe message was come, and we were going to dear Mamma, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t write,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she went back to her place, and tried to write, and sat with her\r\nhead on her hand, and dawdled and cried and blotted till it grew so near\r\npost-time that at last Miss Fosbrook took the longest of her scrawls, and\r\nwriting three lines at the bottom to say how it was with them all,\r\ndirected it to Captain Merrifield, thinking that he would like it better\r\nthan nothing from home, sent it off, and made Susan come out to refresh\r\nher hot eyes and burning head in the garden.\r\n\r\nSam presently came and walked on her other side, gravely and in silence,\r\nglad to be away from the chatter and disputes of the younger ones.  That\r\nsummons had made them both feel older, and less like children, than ever\r\nbefore; but they did not speak much, only, when they sat down on a garden\r\nbench, as Miss Fosbrook held Susan\xe2\x80\x99s hand, she presently found some rough\r\nhard young fingers stealing into her own on the other side, and saw Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes glistening with unshed tears.  She stroked his hand, and they\r\ndropped fast: but he was ashamed to cry, and quickly dried them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will be a man, Sam; take care of Susan,\r\nand be a comfort to your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody can tell how beforehand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnly watch to see what he\r\nmay seem to want to have done for him.  Sit quietly by, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get in\r\nthe way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you ever so unhappy, Miss Fosbrook?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, once I was, when my father was knocked down by an omnibus, and was\r\nvery ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\nShe did tell them of her week of sorrow and anxious care of the younger\r\nchildren, and the brightening ray of hope at last.  It seemed to freshen\r\nboth up, and give them hopes, for each drew a long sigh of relief; and\r\nthen Sam said, \xe2\x80\x9cPapa wrote to Mr. Carey.  She is to be prayed for in\r\nchurch to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, with a sound as of dismay, which made Christabel ask in\r\nwonder why she was sorry, when, from Susan\xe2\x80\x99s half-uttered words, she\r\nfound that the little girl fancied that a \xe2\x80\x9chappy issue out of all her\r\nafflictions\xe2\x80\x9d meant death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat it means is, that the afflictions may\r\nend happily in whatever way God may see to be best; it may be in getting\r\nwell; it may be the other way: at any rate, it is asking that the\r\ndistress may be over, not saying how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there some other prayer in the Prayer-book about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam,\r\nlooking straight before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show you where to find it, in the Visitation of the Sick.  I dare\r\nsay it has often been read to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy and girl came in with her, and brought their Prayer-books to her\r\nroom, that she might mark them.\r\n\r\nThis had been a strange, long, sad day of waiting and watching for the\r\ntelegram, and the children even fancied it might come in the middle of\r\nthe night; but Miss Fosbrook thought this unlikely, and looked for the\r\nmorrow\xe2\x80\x99s post.  There was no letter.  It was very disappointing, but Miss\r\nFosbrook thought it a good sign, since at least the danger could not be\r\nmore pressing, and delay always left room for hope.\r\n\r\nThe children readily believed her; they were too young to go on dwelling\r\nlong on what was not in sight; and even Susan was cheerful, and able to\r\nthink about other things after her night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, and the relief of not\r\nhearing a worse account.\r\n\r\nThe children might do as they pleased about going to church on saints\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndays, and on this day all the three girls wished to go, as soon as it had\r\nbeen made clear that even if the message should come before the short\r\nservice would be over, there would be ample time to reach the station\r\nbefore the next train.  Miss Fosbrook was glad to prove this, for not\r\nonly did she wish to have them in church, but she thought the weary\r\nwatching for the telegram was the worst thing possible for Susan.  Sam\r\nwas also going to church, but Henry hung back, after accompanying them to\r\nthe end of the kitchen-garden.  \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go, Sam; just suppose if the\r\nmessage came without anyone at home, and you had to set out at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but they always put on a special train whenever anyone is ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there would be plenty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least they did when Mr. Greville\xe2\x80\x99s mother was ill, so they will now;\r\nand then you may ride upon the engine, for there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any carriages,\r\nyou know.  I say, Sam, if you go to church, and the telegraph comes, I\r\nshall set off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll do no such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou had much better come to\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t.  It is like a girl to go to church on a week-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is much more like a girl to mind what a couple of asses, like the\r\nGrevilles, say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sam, taking up his cap and running after his\r\nsisters and their governess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Henry to John and David, who alone remained\r\nto listen to him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one of us should stay in case the telegraph comes\r\nin, and there are any orders to give.  I can catch the pony, you know,\r\nand ride off to Bonchamp, and if the special train is there, I shall get\r\nupon the engine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is Sam and Susan who are going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s only because Sam is eldest.  I know Mamma would like to have\r\nme much better, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t walk hard like Sam; and when I get there,\r\nshe will be so much better already, and we shall be all right; and\r\nAdmiral Penrose will be so delighted at my courage in riding on the\r\nengine and putting out the explosion, or something, that he will give me\r\nmy appointment as naval cadet at once, and I shall have a dirk and a\r\nuniform, and a chest of my own, and be an officer, and get promoted for\r\nfiring red-hot shot out of the batteries at Gibraltar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Hal!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Purday, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t throw them little apples about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are red-hot shot, Purday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll red-hot shot you if you break my cucumber frames, young gentleman!\r\nCome, get out with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProbably anxiety made Purday cross as well as everyone else, or else he\r\ndistrusted Henry\xe2\x80\x99s discretion without Sam, for he hunted the little boys\r\naway wherever they went.  Now they would break the cucumber frames; now\r\nthey would meddle with the gooseberries, or trample on the beds; and at\r\nlast he only relented so far as to let David stay with him on condition\r\nof being very good, and holding the little cabbages as he planted them\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Davie was a solemn one,\xe2\x80\x9d Purday said, and they were great\r\nfriends; but Hal and Johnnie were fairly turned out, as their idle hands\r\nwere continually finding fresh mischief to do in their sauntering\r\ndesultory mood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal, \xe2\x80\x9csince Purday is so savage, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go and look out at\r\nthe gate, and then we shall see if the telegraph comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohnnie had no clear idea what a telegraph was, and was curious to know\r\nhow it would come, rather expecting it to be a man in a red coat on\r\nhorseback, blowing a horn\xe2\x80\x94a sight that certainly was not to be missed; so\r\nhe willingly strolled down after Henry to the gate leading to the lane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see any way at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, looking out into the lane.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall get up, and so see over into the bend of the road;\xe2\x80\x9d and Hal mounted\r\nto the topmost bar of the gate, and sat astride there, John scrambling\r\nafter him not quite so easily, his legs being less long, and his dress\r\nless convenient.  Both knew that their Papa strongly objected to their\r\nclimbing on this iron gate, the newest and handsomest thing about the\r\nplace; but thought Hal, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course no one will care what I do when I am\r\nso anxious about poor Mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d and thought Johnnie, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Hal does, of\r\ncourse I may do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo there the two young gentlemen sat perched, each with one leg on either\r\nside of the new iron gate.  It was rather like sitting on the edge of a\r\nknife; and John could scarcely reach his toes down to rest them on the\r\nbar below, but he held on by the spikes, and it was so new and glorious a\r\nposition, that it made up for a good deal to be five feet above the road;\r\nmoreover, Hal said it was just like the mast-head of a man-of-war\xe2\x80\x94at\r\n_least_, when the waves didn\xe2\x80\x99t dash right overhead, like the picture of\r\nthe Eddystone Lighthouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHollo! what, a couple of cherubs aloft!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice from the road;\r\nand looking round, Henry beheld the two Grevilles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s very jolly up here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! is it?  Riding on a razor, to my mind.  Come down, and have a lark,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Osmond; while Martin, undoing the gate, proceeded to swing it\r\nbackwards and forwards, to John\xe2\x80\x99s extreme terror; but the more he clung\r\nto the spikes, and cried for mercy, the quicker Martin swung it, shouting\r\nwith laughter at his fright.  Henry meanwhile scrambled and tumbled to\r\nthe ground, and caught the gate and held it fast, while he asked what his\r\nfriends had been about.  One held up a scarlet flask of powder, the other\r\na bag of shot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a gun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but we know where gardener keeps his; and the governor\xe2\x80\x99s out for the\r\nday.  Come along, Hal: you shall have your turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go far from home to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stuff!  What was it Mamma heard, Osmond?  That your mother was ever\r\nso much better, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Osmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind: your hanging about here won\xe2\x80\x99t do her any good, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99ll catch it from the governess!\xe2\x80\x94I say, how many seams shall you\r\nhave to sew to-day, Hal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t sew seams: I do as I please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!  Is that them coming out of church!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is! it is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John from his elevation.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, help me down,\r\nHal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Henry did not want Miss Fosbrook to find him partaking in\r\ngate-climbing; and either that desire, or the general terror a bad\r\nconscience, made him and the Grevilles run helter-skelter the opposite\r\nway, leaving poor little John stuck on the top of the gate, quite giddy\r\nat the thought of coming down alone, and almost as much afraid of being\r\nthere caught by Miss Fosbrook coming home from church.\r\n\r\nIt was a false alarm after all, that the congregation were coming out.\r\nJohn would have been glad if they had; for nothing could be more\r\nmiserable than sitting up there, his fingers tired of clutching the\r\nspikes, his feet strained with reaching down to the bar, his legs chilled\r\nwith the wind, his head almost giddy when he thought of climbing down.\r\nHe would have cried, could he have spared a hand to rub his eyes with; he\r\nhad a great mind to have roared for help, especially when he heard feet\r\nupon the road; but these turned out to belong to five little village\r\nboys, still smaller than himself, who, when they saw the young gentleman\r\non his perch, all stood still in a row, with their mouths wide open,\r\nstaring at him.  Johnnie scorned to let them think he was not riding\r\nthere for his own pleasure; so he tried to put a bold face of the matter,\r\nand look as much at ease and indifferent as he could, under great bodily\r\nfear and discomfort, the injury of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s desertion, the\r\nexpectation of disgrace, and the reflection that he was being disobedient\r\nto his parents in the height of their trouble!\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in grief that of necessity makes children or grown\r\npeople good.  Sometimes, especially when there is suspense, it fills them\r\nwith excitement, as well as putting them out of their usual habits; and\r\nthus it often happens that there are tremendous explosions of naughtiness\r\njust when some one is ill in a house, and the children ought to be most\r\ngood.  But it is certain that unless trouble be taken in the right way,\r\nit makes people worse instead of better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAL had got into a mood in which he was tired of fears and of waiting for\r\ntidings, and was glad to shake off the thought, and be carried along to\r\nsomething new, he and the Grevilles were rather fond of one another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany, in an idle sort of way.  They \xe2\x80\x9cput him up to things,\xe2\x80\x9d as he\r\nsaid; they made a variety; and he was always glad of listeners to his\r\nwonderful stories, which rather diverted the other boys, who, though they\r\nsometimes made game of them, were much less apt to pick them to pieces\r\nthan was Sam.\r\n\r\nPoor Captain Merrifield! what had not befallen him, according to his son?\r\nHe had been stuck on to a rock of loadstone; he had been bitten by\r\nmosquitos as big as jackdaws\xe2\x80\x94at least as jack-snipes; he had sat down to\r\nrest on the trunk of a fallen tree, and it whisked him over on his face,\r\nand turned out to be a rattle-snake\xe2\x80\x94at least, a boa-constrictor!  Nay,\r\nHenry discoursed on the ponies he had himself tamed, the rabbits he had\r\nshot, the trees he had climbed, the nests he had found, the rats he had\r\nkilled, in terms he durst not use when his brother was by; or if he did,\r\nand Sam brought him to book, he always said \xe2\x80\x9cit was all fun.\xe2\x80\x9d  It often\r\nseemed as if he did not himself know whether he meant to be believed or\r\notherwise; and as to his intentions for his sailor life, they were, as\r\nhas been already seen, of the most splendid character!  Sometimes he shot\r\nthe French admiral dead from the mast-head; sometimes he sailed into\r\nPlymouth with the whole enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fleet behind him; sometimes he, the\r\nyoungest midshipman, rescued the whole crew in a wreck where all the\r\nother officers were drowned; sometimes he shot a shark through the head,\r\njust as it was about to make a meal of Prince Alfred!\r\n\r\nHe certainly was thus an entertaining companion to those who did not pay\r\nheed to truth, and liked to hear or laugh at great swelling words; and\r\nthe Grevilles, on their idle day, were glad to have him with them, and\r\nwere rather curious to prove how much fact there was in his boast of\r\nbeing a most admirable shot.\r\n\r\nMeddling with guns was absolutely forbidden to all the three, except by\r\nspecial permission and with an elder looking on; but the Grevilles were\r\nnot in the habit of obeying, except when they were forced to do so; and\r\nHenry, having once begun to think no one would heed his present doings,\r\nwas ready to go on rather than be accused of minding his governess.\r\n\r\nSo the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s gun was taken from the hiding-place, whither it had\r\nbeen conveyed from the tool-house; and the three boys ran off together,\r\ntheir first object being to get out of the Greville grounds, where they\r\ncould be met by any of the men.  They got quite out into the fields,\r\nbefore they ventured to stop that Osmond might load the gun.  Each was to\r\ntake a shot in turn; Osmond tried first, at a poor innocent young thrush,\r\nnewly come out for his earliest flight.  Happily he missed it; Martin\r\nclaimed the next, and for want of anything better to shoot, took aim at\r\nthe scare-crow in the middle of Farmer Grice\xe2\x80\x99s beans.  He was sure that\r\nhe had hit it, and showed triumphantly the great holes in its hat; but\r\nthe other boys were strongly persuaded that they had been there before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Osmond; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a great deal too near old\r\nGrice\xe2\x80\x99s farm-yard.  If we go popping about here, we shall have him out\r\nupon us, for an old tiger as he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin.\r\n\r\nBut Hal had just got the gun, and saw something so black and shiny\r\nthrough the hedge, that he was persuaded that a flock of rooks were\r\nfeeding in the next field, and he fired!\r\n\r\nSuch a cackling and screeching as arose! and with it one dying gobble,\r\nand a very loud \xe2\x80\x9cHollo! you rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes! you\xe2\x80\x99ve been and gone and done it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Osmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut! cut!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Martin; and Hal, not exactly knowing what he had\r\ndone, but sure that it was something dreadful, and hearing voices in\r\npursuit, threw down the gun, and took to his heels; but the others had\r\nthe start of him, and were over the gap long before he could get to it.\r\nAnd even as he did reach it, a hand was on his throat, almost choking\r\nhim, and a tremendous voice cried, \xe2\x80\x9cYou young poacher, you sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\noff that way!  I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you up to the Bench, that I will, for shooting\r\nthe poor old turkey-cock before my very eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hal, turning in the terrible\r\ngrip; \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was only a rook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rook, I dare say!  And what business had you to think, coming\r\ntrespassing here on my ground, and breaking the hedges!  I\xe2\x80\x99d have you up\r\nfor that, if for nothing else, you young vagabond!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!  I\xe2\x80\x99m Henry Merrifield!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you\xe2\x80\x99re Henry Merry Andrew!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farmer Grice, who was a\r\nsurly man, and had a grudge of long standing against the Captain, for\r\nwithstanding him at the Board of Guardians.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have the law out of\r\nyou, whoever you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94Mamma is so very ill!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hal, bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more shame for you to be rampaging about the country this fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the farmer, giving him a shake that seemed to make all his bones\r\nrattle in his skin.  \xe2\x80\x9cServe you right if I flogged you within an inch of\r\nyour life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I mean please do\xe2\x80\x94anything but have me up to the\r\nmagistrates!  I\xe2\x80\x99ll never do it again, never!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Henry in his terror.\r\n\r\nMr. Grice had some pity, and also knew that his wife and all the\r\nneighbours would be shocked at his prosecuting so young a boy, whose\r\nparents were in such distress.  So he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll overlook\r\nit this time, sir, so as I have the value of the bird.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the value\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d asked Henry, trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cValue!  Why, the breed came from Norfolk; he was three years old; and my\r\nmissus set great store on him, he was as good as a house-dog, to keep\r\nidle children out of the yard; and it was quite a picture to see him\r\nposturing about, and setting up his tail!  Value! not less than\r\nfive-and-twenty shillings, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have not five-and-twenty shillings.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t get them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal,\r\nfalling back into misery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have thought of that before you shot poor old Tom Turkey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nquoth Farmer Grice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what in the world shall I ever do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for you to settle, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer, taking up the unlucky\r\ngun.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall take this, and keep it out of further harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh pray, pray!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Henry.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my gun; it is Mr. Greville\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nplease let me have it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! was it those young dogs, the Master Grevilles, that were with\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mr. Grice.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d known that, I\xe2\x80\x99d not have let you off so\r\neasy.  Those boys are the plague of the place; I wish it had been one of\r\nthem as I\xe2\x80\x99d caught, I\xe2\x80\x99d have had some satisfaction out of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry entreated again for the gun, explaining that they had not leave to\r\ntake it; but the farmer was unrelenting.  He might go to them, he said,\r\nto make up the price of the poor turkey-cock; how they could have got the\r\ngun was no affair of his; have it they should not, till the money was\r\nbrought to him; and if it did not come before night, he should carry the\r\ngun up to the Park, and complain to Mr. Greville.\r\n\r\nWith this answer the unhappy Hal was released, and ran after his friends\r\nto tell them of the terms.  He found them sitting on a low wall, just\r\nwithin their own grounds, waiting to hear what had become of him.  When\r\nhe had told his story, they both set upon him for betraying them, and\r\ndeclared that they should send him to Coventry ever after, and never do\r\nanything with him again; but as it was plain that the gun must be\r\nredeemed, if they wished to avoid severe punishment, there was a\r\nconsultation.  Nobody had much money; but Osmond consolingly suspected\r\nthat the farmer would take less; five-and-twenty shillings was an\r\nexorbitant price to set on a turkey-cock\xe2\x80\x99s head, and perhaps half would\r\ncontent him.\r\n\r\nThe half, however, seemed as impossible as the whole.  Osmond had three\r\nshillings, Martin two, Hal fourpence!  What was to be done?  And the boys\r\ndeclared that if it should come to their father\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, Hal, who had\r\ngiven up their names, should certainly not be shielded by them.  In fact,\r\nhe, who had done the deed, was the only one who ought to pay.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the servants\xe2\x80\x99 dinner-bell at the Park broke up the\r\nconsultation; the boys must not be missed at luncheon; and they therefore\r\nseparated, agreeing to meet at that same place at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, to hear\r\nthe result of Hal\xe2\x80\x99s negotiation with the farmer; for neither of the\r\nGrevilles would hear of helping him to face the enemy.\r\n\r\nPoor Hal plodded home disconsolately.  Once he thought of telling Sam,\r\nand asking his help; but Sam would be so much shocked at such a scrape at\r\nsuch a time, as possibly to lick him for it before helping him.  Indeed\r\nHal did not see much chance of Sam being able to do anything for them;\r\nand he had too often boasted over his elder brother to like to abase\r\nhimself by such a confession\xe2\x80\x94when, too, it would almost be owning how\r\nmuch better it would have been to have followed Sam\xe2\x80\x99s advice and have\r\ngone safely to church.\r\n\r\nCould he borrow of any one?  Had he nothing of his own to sell or\r\nexchange?  Ah! if it had not been for that stupid hoard of little\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s, he might have had even so much!  By-the-bye, some of that\r\ncollection was his own.  He might quite lawfully take that back again.\r\nHow much could it be?  How much did he put in last week? the week before?\r\nOh, never mind; some of it was his at all events; there was no harm in\r\ntaking that.  Most likely he should be able to restore it four-fold when\r\nColonel Carey made his present; or, if not, nobody knew exactly what was\r\nin Toby Fillpot; and after all very likely they would forget all about\r\nit; people could not think about pigs when Mamma was ill; or, maybe, he\r\nshould go to join his ship, and hear no more of it.  So he came home, and\r\ncrossed the paddock just as the dinner-bell was ringing, opening the\r\nhall-door as the children were running across it to the dining-room.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook, who was walking behind them, turned as he came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have sent Johnnie to dine in the nursery, for his\r\ndisobedience in climbing the gate.  I certainly shall not give you a less\r\npunishment.  You must have led him into it; and how could you be so cruel\r\nas to leave the poor little fellow alone in such a dangerous place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid little coward! it was not a bit of danger!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo young a child\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all your London notions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I climbed up our\r\ngate at Stonehouse, which was twice as high, when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t near as old as\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to argue with you, Henry; but after such an act of\r\ndisobedience, I cannot allow you to sit down to dinner with us.  Go up to\r\nthe school-room, and Mary shall bring you your dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to dine with a lot of babies and governesses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Henry, and bounced up-stairs, leaving Miss Fosbrook quite\r\nconfounded at such an outbreak of naughtiness.\r\n\r\nShe intended, as soon as dinner should be over, to go up to him, and try\r\nto lead him to be sorry for his conduct, and to think what a wretched\r\nmoment this was for such audacity; and then she feared that she ought to\r\npunish him farther, by keeping him in all the afternoon.  He was so soft\r\nand easily impressed, that she almost trusted to make him feel that it\r\nwould be right that he should suffer for his misconduct.\r\n\r\nWhen she went up-stairs, almost as soon as grace had been said, he was\r\ngone.  Nobody could find him, and calling produced no answer.  She became\r\nquite distressed and anxious, but could not go far from the house\r\nherself, nor send Sam, in case the message should arrive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt he\xe2\x80\x99s after something with the Grevilles, and\r\nwas afraid you would stop him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to believe this, but still felt far from satisfied all the\r\nafternoon, and was glad to see the boy come back in time for tea.\r\n\r\nHe said he had been with the Grevilles; he did not see why anybody need\r\nask him questions; he should do what he pleased without being called to\r\naccount.  Nobody told him not to run away after dinner; he was not going\r\nto stay to be ordered about for nothing.\r\n\r\nThis was so bad a temper, that Christabel could not bear to try to touch\r\nhim with the thought of his sick mother.  She knew that softening must\r\ncome in time, and believed the best thing to do at the moment would be to\r\nput a stop to his disrespectful speeches to her, and his cross ones to\r\nhis brothers and sisters, by sending him to bed as soon as tea was over,\r\nas the completion of his punishment.  He did not struggle, for she had\r\ntaught him to mind her; but he went up-stairs with a gloomy brow, and\r\nangry murmurs that it was very hard to be put under a stupid woman, who\r\nknew nothing about anything, and was always cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURDAY\xe2\x80\x99S post brought a letter, and a comfortable one.  All Thursday\r\nMrs. Merrifield had been in so doubtful a state, that her husband could\r\nnot bear to write, lest he should fill the children with false hopes, or\r\nalarm them still more; but she had had a good night, was stronger on\r\nFriday, and when the post went out, the doctors had just ventured to say\r\nthey believed she would recover favourably.  The letter was finished off\r\nin a great hurry; but Captain Merrifield did not forget to thank his\r\nlittle Susan warmly for her poor scrambling letter, and say he knew all\r\nshe meant by it, bidding her give Miss Fosbrook his hearty thanks for\r\nforwarding it, and for telling him the children were all behaving well,\r\nand feeling properly.  His love to them all; they must try to deserve the\r\ngreat mercy that had been granted to them.\r\n\r\nTo the children, this was almost as good as saying that their mother was\r\nwell again; but there was too much awe about them for their joy to show\r\nitself noisily.  Susan ran away to her own room, and Bessie followed her;\r\nand Sam said no word, only Miss Fosbrook remarked that he did not eat two\r\nmouthfuls of breakfast.  She would not take any notice; she knew his\r\nheart was full; and when she looked round on that little flock, and\r\nthought of the grievous sorrow scarcely yet averted from them, she could\r\nhardly keep the tears from blinding her.  They were all somewhat still\r\nand grave, and it was too happy a morning to be broken into by the\r\nreproofs that Henry deserved, even more richly than Christabel knew.  She\r\nhad almost forgotten his bad behaviour; and when she remembered something\r\nof it, she could not but hope that silence, on such a day as this, might\r\nbring it home to him more than rebuke.  Yet when breakfast was ever, he\r\nwas among the loudest of those who, shaking off the strange, awed gravity\r\nof deep gladness, went rushing together into the garden, feeling that\r\nthey might give way to their spirits again.\r\n\r\nSam shouted and whooped as if he were casting off a burthen, and picking\r\nlittle George up in his arms, tossed him and swung him round in the air\r\nin an ecstasy; while John and Annie and David went down on the grass\r\ntogether, and tumbled and rolled one over the other like three kittens,\r\ntheir legs and arms kicking about, so that it was hard to tell whose\r\nproperty were the black shoes that came wriggling into view.\r\n\r\nSusan was quieter.  She told Nurse the good news, and then laid hold upon\r\nBaby, and carried her off into the passage to hug all to herself.  She\r\ncould tell no one but Baby how very happy she was, and how her heart had\r\ntrembled at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s suffering, her father\xe2\x80\x99s grief, and at the\r\ndesolateness that had so nearly come on them.  Oh, she was very happy,\r\nvery thankful; but she could not scream it out like the others, Baby must\r\nhave it all in kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristabel,\xe2\x80\x9d said a little voice, when all the others were gone, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall never be pipy again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must try to fight against it, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, coming close up to her, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen dear Mamma was\r\nso ill, it did seem so silly to mind about not having pretty things like\r\nIda, and the boys plaguing, and so on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear; a real trouble makes us ashamed of our little\r\ndiscontents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said so many times yesterday, and the day before, that I would never\r\nmind things again, if only Mamma would get well and come home,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlittle girl; \xe2\x80\x9cand I never shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not always find it easy not to mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if\r\nyou try hard, you will learn how to keep from showing that you mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, (and a great mouthful of an oh! it was,) \xe2\x80\x9cthose\r\nthings are grown so silly and little now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen them in their true light for once, my dear.  And now that\r\nyou have so great cause of thankfulness to God, you feel that your\r\nfoolish frets and discontents were unthankful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, her eyes cast down, as they always were when anything\r\nof this kind was said to her, as if she did not like to meet the look\r\nfixed on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, Bessie, try to make the giving up of these murmurs your\r\nthank-offering to God.  Suppose every day when you say your prayers, you\r\nwere to add something like this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and she wrote down on a little bit of\r\npaper, \xe2\x80\x9cO Thou, who hast raised up my mother from her sickness, teach me\r\nto be a thankful and contented child, and to guard my words and thoughts\r\nfrom peevishness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it too small to pray about?\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is too small to pray about, my dear.  Do you think this little\r\nmidge is too small for God to have made it, and given it life, and spread\r\nthat mother-of-pearl light on its wings?  Do you think yourself too small\r\nto pray? or your fault too small to pray about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth cast down her eyes.  She did not quite think it was a fault,\r\nbut she did not say so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBessie, what was the great sin of the Israelites in the wilderness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colour on her cheek showed that she knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey tempted God by murmurs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey tried His patience\r\nby grumbling, when His care and blessings were all round them, and by\r\ncrying out because all was not just as they liked.  Now, dear Bessie, God\r\nhas shown you what a real sorrow might be; will it not be tempting Him to\r\ngo back to complaints over what He has ordained for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall net complain now; I shall not care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.  But she\r\ntook the little bit of paper, and Christabel trusted that she would make\r\nuse of it, knowing that in this lay her hope of cure; for whatever she\r\nmight think in this first joy of relief, her little troubles were sure to\r\nseem quite as unbearable while they were upon her as if she had never\r\nfeared a great one.\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing remarkable happened; everyone was bright and happy; but\r\nstill the influence of their past alarm subdued them enough to make them\r\nquiet and well-behaved, both on Saturday and Sunday; and Miss Fosbrook\r\nhad never had so little trouble with them.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this, and of the agitation and unsettled state that\r\nhad put the last week out of all common rules, she announced on Monday\r\nmorning that she would excuse all the fines, and that all the children\r\nshould have their allowance unbroken.  Maybe she was moved to this by the\r\nsuspicion that these four sixpences and three threepennies would make up\r\nthe fund to the price of a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable pig;\xe2\x80\x9d and she thought it time that\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s perseverance should be rewarded, and room made in his mind for\r\nsomething beyond swine and halfpence.\r\n\r\nHer announcement was greeted by the girls with eager thanks, by the boys\r\nwith a tremendous \xe2\x80\x9cThree times three for Miss Fosbrook!\xe2\x80\x9d and Bessie was\r\nso joyous, that instead of crying out against the noise, she joined in\r\nwith Susan and Annie; but they made such a ridiculous little squeaking,\r\nthat Sam laughed at them, and took to mocking their queer thin hurrahs.\r\nYet even this Elizabeth could bear!\r\n\r\nDavid was meanwhile standing by the locker, his fingers at work as if he\r\nwere playing a tune, his lips counting away, \xe2\x80\x9cNinety-two, ninety-three,\r\nninety-four\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s me; ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nJack,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on; till having plodded up diligently, he turned round with\r\na little scream, \xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred and twenty!  That\xe2\x80\x99s the pig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred and twenty pence.  Sukey said one hundred and twenty pence\r\nwere ten shillings.  That will do it!  That\xe2\x80\x99s the pig!  Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nit!  May I take it to Purday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was to be let alone till fair-day, you little bother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d cried many voices; \xe2\x80\x9conly till we had enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am sure nobody knows if we have,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hal hotly.  \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of\r\nhalfpence, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know, Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted David.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere are eighty-nine pence and one\r\nfarthing in Toby Fillpot, and this makes one hundred and twenty-two pence\r\nand one farthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d no business to peep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t peep,\xe2\x80\x9d said David indignantly.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere were forty-eight pence\r\nat first, and then Susie had three, that was fifty-one\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  And he would\r\nhave gone on like a little calculating machine, with the entire reckoning\r\nin his head, if the others had had patience to hear; but Annie and\r\nJohnnie were urgent to have the sum counted out before their eyes.  Hal\r\nroughly declared it was against the rules, and little inquisitives must\r\nnot have their way.  But others were also inquisitive; and Sam said it\r\nwould be best to know how much they had, that Purday might be told to\r\nlook out for a pig at the price; besides, he wanted to have it over; it\r\nwas such a bore not to have any money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not fair!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Henry passionately.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t keep the rules!\r\nYou sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t have my sixpence, I can tell you; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t stay\r\nand see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody wants you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there were any rules,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girls; but Hal was already\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHal has only put in fivepence-halfpenny,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, \xe2\x80\x9cso no wonder he\r\nis ashamed.  Such a big boy, with sixpence a week!  But if he won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nus have his sixpence now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, we will make it up next week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, who will take Toby down?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, unbuttoning one\r\nglass door, and undoing the two bolts of the second, behind which the cup\r\nof money stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusie ought, because she is the eldest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavie ought, because he is the youngest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid stood on a chair to take Toby off his shelf.  Solemn was the face\r\nwith which the little boy lifted the mug by the handle, putting his other\r\nhand to steady the expected weight of coppers; but there was at once a\r\nfrown, a little cry of horror.  Toby came up so light in his hand, that\r\nall his great effort was thrown away, and only made him stagger back in\r\ndismay, falling backward from the chair, and poor Toby crashing to pieces\r\non the floor as he fell, while out rolled\xe2\x80\x94one solitary farthing!\r\n\r\nNobody spoke for some moments; but all stood perfectly still, staring as\r\nhard as if they hoped the pence would be brought out by force of looking\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nThen David\xe2\x80\x99s knuckles went up into his eyes, and he burst forth in a loud\r\nbellow.  It was the first time Miss Fosbrook had heard him cry, and she\r\nfeared that he had been hurt by the fall, or cut by the broken crockery;\r\nbut he struck out with foot and fist, as if his tears were as much anger\r\nas grief, and roared out, \xe2\x80\x9cI want the halfpence for my pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cif you have hid them for a trick, let him have\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I play tricks _now_?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sam in indignation.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps Hal has,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Bessie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, half in self-defence, half in fright,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat one of you must have been at the baby-house, for I found the doors\r\nopen, and shut them up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why should it be one of us?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Sam; while David stopped\r\ncrying, and listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause none of the younger ones can reach to undo the doors,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nElizabeth.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was as much as I could do to reach the upper bolt, though\r\nI stood upon a chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was evident; for the baby-house was really an old-fashioned bureau,\r\nand below the glass doors there was a projecting slope of polished\r\nwalnut, upon which only a fly could stand, and which was always locked.\r\nNo one whose years were less than half a score was tall enough to get a\r\ngood hold of the button, even from the highest chair, far less to jerk\r\ndown the rather stiff upper bolt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot have been a little one, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nyou should not be so ready to accuse your brothers, Bessie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid, however, had laid hold of a hope, and getting up from the floor,\r\nhastened out of the room, followed by John; and they were presently heard\r\nshouting \xe2\x80\x9cHal!\xe2\x80\x9d all over the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat day was it that you found the door open, Bessie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss\r\nFosbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just after dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, recollecting herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on Friday.  Yes, I remember it was Friday, because I went into\r\nthe school-room to get my pencil, and I was afraid Hal would jump out\r\nupon me, and looked in first to see whether he was going to be tiresome;\r\nbut he was gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cit was the day we found poor Jack stuck up on the\r\ngate, when he and Hal were in disgrace.  Oh, he never would have played\r\ntricks then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you go up before me, Bessie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I went up\r\ndirectly after dinner to speak to Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.  \xe2\x80\x9cI thought if you got in first, you would be\r\nscolding him ever so long, and would let nobody in, so I would get my\r\npencil first; and I slipped up before you had left the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then the two boys were heard stumping up the stairs, and ran in,\r\npanting with haste and excitement, David with a fiery red ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; Hal didn\xe2\x80\x99t hide it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he boxed Davie\xe2\x80\x99s ear for thinking he did,\xe2\x80\x9d added John; \xe2\x80\x9cand said\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d do the same for spiteful Bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he never played tricks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated David; \xe2\x80\x9cand he said I\xe2\x80\x99d no business to ask; and if Bet\r\nwent prying about everywhere, I\xe2\x80\x99d better ask her.  Have you got it,\r\nBetty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Elizabeth.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you, Davie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have got a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed David; \xe2\x80\x9cand you always were cross\r\nabout Hannah Higgins\xe2\x80\x99s pig.  You have got it to tease me!  Miss Fosbrook,\r\nmake her give it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, David,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cBessie is quite to be trusted;\r\nand it is wrong to make unfounded accusations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Betty,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sam kindly; \xe2\x80\x9cif Davie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a little donkey,\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the governess.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he not come himself?\r\nCall him; I want to know if he observed this door being open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is gone down to Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is high time you were there too, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook,\r\nstarting.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are late, beg Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s pardon from me, and tell him\r\nthat I kept you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam was obliged to run off at full speed; and the other children stood\r\nabout, still aghast and excited.  Miss Fosbrook, however, told them to\r\ntake out their books.  She would not do anything more till she had had\r\ntime to think, and had composed their minds and her own; for she was\r\nexceedingly shocked, and felt herself partly in fault, for having left\r\nthe hoard in an unlocked cupboard.  She feared to do anything hastily,\r\nlest she should bring suspicion on the innocent; and she thought all\r\nwould do better if time were given for settling down.  All were\r\ndisappointed at thus losing the excitement, fancying perhaps that instant\r\nsearch and inquiry would hunt up the money; and David put himself quite\r\ninto a sullen fit.  No, he would not turn round, nor read, nor do\r\nanything, unless Miss Fosbrook would make stingy Bet give up the pence.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook and Susan both tried to argue with him; but he had set his\r\nmind upon one point so vehemently, that it was making him absolutely\r\nstupid to everything else; and he was such a little boy (only five years\r\nold), that his mind could hardly grasp the exceeding unlikelihood of a\r\ngirl like Elizabeth committing such a theft, either in sport or earnest,\r\nnor understand the injury of such a suspicion.  He only knew that she had\r\na secret\xe2\x80\x94a counter secret to his pig; and when she hotly assured him that\r\nshe had never touched the money, and Susan backed her up with, \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\r\nshe says she did not,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cShe once told a story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth coloured deep red, and Susan cried out loudly that it was a\r\nshame in David; then explained that it was a long long time ago, that Hal\r\nand Bessie broke the drawing-room window by playing at ball with little\r\nhard apples, and had not told, but when questioned had said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo;\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nindeed they had been so sorry then that she knew they would never do so\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAgain David showed that he could not enter into this, and sulkily\r\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cShe told a story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will have no more of this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel resolutely.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou are all\r\nworking yourselves up into a bad spirit: and not another word will I hear\r\non this matter till lessons are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat tone was always obeyed; but lessons did not prosper; the children\r\nwere all restless and unsettled; and David, hitherto for his age her best\r\nscholar, took no pains, and seemed absolutely stupefied.  What did he\r\ncare for fines, if the chance of the pig was gone?  And he was sullenly\r\nangry with Miss Fosbrook for using no measures to recover the money,\r\nfancied she did not care, and remembered the foolish nursery talk about\r\nher favouring Bessie.\r\n\r\nOnce Miss Fosbrook heard a little gasping from the corner, and looking\r\nround, saw poor Bessie crying quietly over her slate, and trying hard to\r\ncheck herself.  She would not have noticed her, though longing to comfort\r\nher, if David had not cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cBet is crying!  A fine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a fine for an ill-natured speech that has\r\nmade her cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has got the pig\xe2\x80\x99s money,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that again, and I shall punish you, David.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked her full in the face, and said it again.\r\n\r\nShe was thoroughly roused to anger, and kept her word by opening the door\r\nof a small dark closet, and putting David in till dinner-time.\r\n\r\nThen she and Susan both tried to soothe Bessie, by reminding her how\r\nchildish David was, how he had caught up some word that probably Hal had\r\nflung out without meaning it, and how no one of any sense suspected her\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so ill-natured and hard,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Bessie.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo think I could steal!\r\nI think they hate me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cif you only would never be cross to the boys, Bessie,\r\nand not keep out of what they care for, they would never think it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Susie is right there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you try to be one with\r\nthe others, and make common cause with them, giving up and forbearing,\r\nthey never will take such things into their heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _we_ don\xe2\x80\x99t now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan cheerily.  \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear Sam say\r\nnobody but a donkey could think it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Bessie has a secret!\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie.\r\n\r\nAgain stout Susan said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor shame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what my secret is,\xe2\x80\x9d began Bessie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t tell it, dear!  We\xe2\x80\x99ll trust you without; and Sam\r\nwill say the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie flung her arms round Susan\xe2\x80\x99s neck, as if she only now knew the\r\ncomfort of her dear good sister.\r\n\r\nLessons were resumed; and as soon as these were done, Miss Fosbrook\r\nresolved on a thorough search.  Some strange fit of mischief or curiosity\r\nmight have actuated some one, and the money be hidden away; so she\r\nbrought David out of his cupboard, and with Susan\xe2\x80\x99s help turned out every\r\ndrawer and locker in the school-room, forbidding the others to touch or\r\nassist.  They routed out queer nests of broken curiosities, disturbed old\r\ndusty dens of rubbish, peeped behind every row of books; but made no\r\ndiscovery worth mentioning, except the left leg of Annie\xe2\x80\x99s last doll, the\r\nstuffing of Johnnie\xe2\x80\x99s ball, the tiger out of George\xe2\x80\x99s Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark, and the\r\nfirst sheet of Sam\xe2\x80\x99s Latin Grammar, all stuffed together into a\r\nmouse-hole in the skirting.\r\n\r\nAt dinner Christabel forbade the subject to be mentioned, not only to\r\nhinder quarrelsome speeches, but to prevent the loss being talked of\r\namong the servants; since she feared that one of them must have committed\r\nthe theft, and though anxious not to put it into the children\xe2\x80\x99s heads,\r\nsuspected Rhoda, the little nursery-girl, who was quite a child, and had\r\nnot long been in the house.\r\n\r\nHenry ate his dinner in haste, but could not get away till Miss Fosbrook\r\nhad called him away from the rest, and told him that if he had been\r\nplaying a trick on his little brother, it was time to put an end to it,\r\nbefore any innocent person fell under suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing no tricks\xe2\x80\x94at least\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout any _at least_, Henry, have you hidden the money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dined in the school-room on Friday.  Were the baby-house doors open\r\nthen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t open them to take anything out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I want with the things in the baby-house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you, or did you not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94at least\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn one word, did you open them? yes or no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time did you go out after eating your dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother! how is one to remember!  It\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense making such a fuss.\r\nThe children fancied they put in ever so much more than they did, and\r\nvery likely took out some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; David\xe2\x80\x99s reckoning was accurate.  I wrote down all I knew of; and I\r\nam sure none was taken out, for early that very morning I had put in a\r\nsixpence myself, and the cup was then full of coppers, with that little\r\nsilver threepenny of David\xe2\x80\x99s with the edge turned up upon the top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must have left the door undone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare not be positive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I believe I remember\r\nbolting it; and if I had not done so, it would have flown open sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but the wind, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the doors did open, it would not account for the loss of the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry ungraciously, trying to move off: but\r\nshe first required him to tell her what he had said to the younger boys\r\nto make them suspect Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t; at least, if I did, I only said\r\nBess peeped everywhere, and was very close.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suspect her, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook indignantly.  \xe2\x80\x9cNow please to\r\ncome up with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry.\r\n\r\nNo, she would not let him go.  She thought Elizabeth ought to clear\r\nherself, so far as it could be done, by making her secret known, since\r\nthat had drawn suspicion on her; and when all the children were together,\r\nshe called the little girl and told her so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very unkind of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, with trembling lip; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\r\nshall see, if they want _that_ to show I am not a thief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou knows Bessie, I trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for people\xe2\x80\x99s secrets.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\npry into Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one followed their example; all either really suspected, or else were\r\nfull of curiosity, and delighted to gratify it.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen slips of card, with poor little coloured drawings on them,\r\nand as many lengths of penny ribbon!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie, much disappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what Bet made such a fuss about,\xe2\x80\x9d said John; and David\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nfell, as if he had really expected to see the lost pence.\r\n\r\nThe next thing, after the search had been made through all the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed-rooms, was to go to the nursery: and thither Miss Fosbrook allowed\r\nonly Susan and Sam to follow her.  Nurse Freeman was very stiff and\r\nstately, but she had no objection to searching; and the boy and girl\r\nbegan the hunt, while Miss Fosbrook meantime cautiously asked whether\r\nNurse were sure of Rhoda, and if she were trustworthy.\r\n\r\nThis made Mrs. Freeman very angry; and though her words were respectful,\r\nshe showed that she was much offended at the strange lady presuming to\r\nsuspect anyone, especially one under her charge.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook wanted to have asked Rhoda whether the doors were open or\r\nshut when she carried Henry his dinner, but Nurse would not consent to\r\ncall her.  \xe2\x80\x9cI understood the nursery and the girl were to be my\r\nprovince,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss Merrifield heard her mamma say otherwise,\r\nthen it is a different thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan cowered into the dark cupboard.  Nurse must be in a dreadful way to\r\ncall her Miss Merrifield, instead of Missy!\r\n\r\nNothing more could be done.  The pence could not be found.  Nurse would\r\nnot let Rhoda be examined; and all that could be found out from the\r\nchildren had been already elicited.\r\n\r\nChristabel could only beg that no more should be said, and, her head\r\naching with perplexity, hope that some light might yet be thrown on the\r\nmatter.  There must be pain and grief whenever it should be explained;\r\nbut this would be far better, even for the offender, than the present\r\ndeception: and the whole family were in a state of irritation and\r\ndistrust, that hurt their tempers, and made her bitterly reproach herself\r\nwith not having prevented temptation by putting the hoard under lock and\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nShe ordered that no more should be said about it that evening, and made\r\nherself obeyed; but play was dull, and everything went off heavily.  The\r\nnext morning, Susan came back early from her housekeeping business, with\r\nher honest face grave and unhappy, and finding Miss Fosbrook alone, told\r\nher she had something _really_ to say to her if she might; and this being\r\ngranted began, with the bright look of having found a capital notion:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I wish you would do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would call every one in all the house, and ask them on their word\r\nand honour if they took the pence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I am not the head of the house, and I have no right to do that;\r\nbesides, I do not believe it would discover it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! could a thief get in from out of doors!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan looking at the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly that, my dear; but I am afraid a person who could steal would not\r\nscruple to tell a falsehood, and I do not wish to cause this additional\r\nsin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very horrid; I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, puckering up her face\r\nfor tears.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Miss Fosbrook, the maids are all so angry that\r\nyou said anything about Rhoda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not mention it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; nor Sam.  It was Nurse herself!  But they all say that you want\r\nto take away her character; and they won\xe2\x80\x99t have strangers put over them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, Susie; don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me this.  It can do no good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but _please_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then Mary\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how she\r\ncould\xe2\x80\x94but she said that poor dear Bessie was always sly, and that she had\r\nbeen at the cupboard, and had got the pence; but she was your favourite,\r\nand so you vindicated her.  And Nurse began teasing her to confess, and\r\ntell the truth, and told her she was a wicked child because she would\r\nnot; but it was all because we were put under strangers!  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\r\ndo set on Johnnie and Davie to be cross to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was this, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast night, when we went to the nursery to be washed.  It was our night,\r\nyou know.  Oh!  I wish Mamma was well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do my dear.  And how did poor Bessie bear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe got quite white, and never said a word, even when they told her she\r\nwas sulky.  But when we got into bed, and I kissed her and cuddled her\r\nup, oh! she did cry so; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.  So, do you know, I got\r\nmy shawl on, and went and called Sam; and he was not gone to sleep, and\r\nhe came and sat by her, and told her that he believed her, and knew she\r\nwas as sound a heart of oak as any of us; and we both petted her, and Sam\r\nwas so nice and kind, till she went to sleep.  Then he went to the\r\nnursery, and told Nurse how horrid it was in her; but Cook said it only\r\nmade her worse, because she is jealous of our taking part with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I _do_ like to hear of your kindness to Bessie; but I wish you\r\nwould not mind what any of the maids say, nor talk to them about it.  It\r\nonly distresses you for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could not help this attack in the nursery, but you need not talk to\r\nCook or Mary about it.  It is of no use to vex ourselves with what people\r\nsay who don\xe2\x80\x99t know half a story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you tell them not?\xe2\x80\x9d said simple Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I cannot interfere.  They would only do it the more.  We can only\r\nkeep Bessie as much out of the way of the maids as we can, and show our\r\nconfidence in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertainly Elizabeth had been known to look infinitely more glum when\r\nnothing was the matter than under all this vexation, even though the\r\nservants were really very unkind to her; and her two little brothers both\r\nbehaved as ill as possible to her whenever they had the opportunity\xe2\x80\x94David\r\nreally believing that she had made away with the money, and ought to be\r\ntortured for it; and Johnnie taking it on his word, and being one of\r\nthose little boys who have a positive taste for ill-nature, and think it\r\nfun.  They pinched her, they bit her, they rubbed out her sums, they shut\r\nup her lesson-books and lost her place, they put bitten crusts into her\r\nplate, and did whatever they knew she most disliked, whenever Miss\r\nFosbrook or Sam was not in the way; but she never told.  She did not\r\nchoose to be called a tell-tale; and besides, they really did not succeed\r\nin making her life miserable, so much was she pleased with the real\r\nkindness her trouble had brought out from Susan and Sam.  Susan could not\r\nprevent the persecution of the two naughty little boys, but she defended\r\nher sister to her utmost; and Sam cuffed them if they said a word or\r\nlifted a finger against Bessie before him; and he gave her such notice\r\nand kindness as she never had received from him before.  One afternoon,\r\nwhen he was going to walk to Bonchamp, he asked leave for her to come\r\nwith him, and would take nobody else; and hot day as it was, Bessie had\r\nnever had such a charming walk.  She kept herself from making one single\r\nfuss; and in return, he gathered wild strawberries for her, showed her a\r\nkingfisher, and took her to look in at a very grand aquarium in the\r\nfishing-tackle maker\xe2\x80\x99s window, where she saw some gold-fish, and a most\r\ncomical little newt.  And going home, they had a real good talk about\r\ntheir father\xe2\x80\x99s voyage, and how they should get on without him; and Bessie\r\nfound to her great pleasure, that Sam hoped Miss Fosbrook would stay when\r\nMamma Came home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor I do think she has put some sense into you, Bessie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\nShe was so delighted, that instead of preparing to fret if Sam did but\r\nhold up a finger at her, she looked up with a smile when he came in her\r\nway, sure of protection, and expecting something pleasant, as well as\r\nthinking it an honour to be asked to help him in anything.  The next day,\r\nwhen Mr. Carey had insisted on his verifying by the map all the towns\r\nwhich he had been contented to say were in Asia Minor (where every place\r\nin ancient history is always put if its whereabouts be doubtful), she\r\nsaved him so much time and trouble, that he got out into the garden full\r\nhalf an hour earlier than he would otherwise have done.  Thereupon he\r\ntold her she was a jolly good fellow, and gave her such a thump on the\r\nback, as a few weeks ago would have made her scream and whine; but this\r\ntime she took it as a new form of thanks, and felt highly honoured by\r\nbeing invited to help him to fish for minnows, though it almost made her\r\nsick to stick the raw meat upon his hooks.\r\n\r\nThe threatening of a true sorrow, the bearing a real trouble, and the\r\nopening to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s kindness, had done far more to make her a happy\r\nlittle girl than all Miss Fosbrook\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to satisfy her cravings or\r\nplease her tastes.  These had indeed done her some good, and taught her\r\nto find means of enjoyment for those likings that no one else cared for;\r\nbut it had been the _spirit_ of delight that had been chiefly wanting;\r\nand when thankfulness and love were leading her to that, it was much\r\neasier to see that the evening clouds or the rising moon were lovely,\r\nthan when she was looking out for affronts.\r\n\r\nNothing was said in public about the loss; and Christabel hoped that the\r\nbad impression as to Elizabeth would wear out in the young minds of the\r\nlesser children; but David\xe2\x80\x99s whole nature seemed to have been\r\ndisorganized by the disappointment.  Instead of being a pattern child for\r\ndiligence and good behaviour, very fond of Miss Fosbrook, and not only\r\ninoffensive, but often keeping John and Anne in order, he seemed\r\nabsolutely stupid and senseless at lessons, became stubborn at reproof,\r\nseemed to take pleasure in running counter to his governess, and rendered\r\nthe other two, who, though his elders, were both of weak natures compared\r\nwith his own, more openly naughty than himself.  Sometimes it seemed to\r\nChristabel that the habit of spiting Bessie was getting so confirmed,\r\nthat it would last even when the cause was forgotten; and yet the more\r\nshe strove to put it down in sight, the more it throve out of sight; and\r\nwhen she looked at David, and thought how she had once admired him, she\r\ncould not but remember the text that says, \xe2\x80\x9cThy goodness is as the\r\nmorning cloud, and as the dew shall it vanish away.\xe2\x80\x9d  She had thought it\r\ngoodness based upon religious feeling, as well as on natural gravity and\r\norderliness; and so perhaps it had once been, but the little fellow had\r\nfixed his whole soul on one purpose, and though that was a good one, it\r\nhad grown into an idol, and swallowed up all his other motives, till of\r\nlate he had only been good for the sake of the pig, not because it was\r\nright.  Being disappointed of the pig, he had nothing to fall back upon,\r\nbut felt himself so ill-used, that it seemed to him that it was no use to\r\nbe good; and he revenged himself by naughtiness.\r\n\r\nSuch sturdy strong characters as little David\xe2\x80\x99s, when they are once set\r\non the right object, come to the very best kind of goodness; but when\r\nthey take a wrong turn, they are the very worst, both for themselves and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Monday after the loss of the pence was a pouring wet day.  The whole\r\ncourt was like a flood, and the drops went splashing up again as if in\r\nplay; Purday wore his master\xe2\x80\x99s old southwester coat, and looked shiny all\r\nover; and when the maids had to cross the court, they went click, click,\r\nin their pattens under their umbrellas.\r\n\r\nBut it was baking day, and Susan and Annie had been down to coax the cook\r\ninto making them a present of a handsome allowance of dough, and Miss\r\nFosbrook into letting them manipulate it in the school-room.  Probably\r\nthis was the only way of preventing the dough from being turned into\r\nbullets, and sent flying at each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, or possibly plastered on\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and the cook and kitchenmaid from being nearly driven\r\ncrazy.\r\n\r\nThe dough was justly divided, and an establishment set up in each locker.\r\nBessie declined altogether; Sam had lent her his beautiful book of _The\r\nBritish Songsters_, and she was hard at work at the table copying a\r\ntom-tit, since she no longer carried on the work in secret; but at one\r\nlocker were the other three elders, at the other the three lesser ones,\r\nand little George in a corner by Susan, pegging away at his own private\r\nlump, and constantly begging for more.  Susan\xe2\x80\x99s ambition was to make a\r\nset of real twists, just like Cook\xe2\x80\x99s; and she pulled out and twisted and\r\nplaited, though often robbed of her dough by the two boys, whose united\r\nefforts were endeavouring to produce a likeness of Purday, with his hat\r\non his head, plums for eyes, a pipe in his mouth, and driving a cow; but\r\nunluckily his neck always got pinched off, and his arms would not stay\r\non!  No matter; the more moulding of that soft dough the better!  Johnnie\r\nand Annie had a whole party of white clammy serpents, always being set to\r\nbite one another, and to melt into each other; and David was hard at work\r\non a brood of rabbits with currant eyes, and would let no one interfere\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I hear something!\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bessie, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s only the roller,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cPurday always rolls on a wet day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething, however, made the whole party of little bakers hold up their\r\nheads to listen.  There was a gleam on their faces, as a quick alert step\r\nsounded on the stairs, and Bessie, the nearest to the door, and not\r\ncramped like the rest, who were sitting on their heels, sprang forward\r\nand opened it with a scream of joy.\r\n\r\nThere he was\xe2\x80\x94the light, alert, weather-beaten man, with his loose wavy\r\nhair, and bright sailor face!  There was Papa!  Oh, the hurly-burly of\r\nchildren, tumbling up as well as they could on legs crooked under them,\r\nand holding out great fans of floury doughy paws, all coming to be hugged\r\nin his arms in turn, so that before he had come to the end of the eight\r\nin presence, Bessie had had time to whisk off to the nursery, snatch Baby\r\nup from before Nurse\xe2\x80\x99s astonished eyes, rush down with her, and put her\r\ninto his arms.  Baby had forgotten him, and was taken with such a fit of\r\nscreaming shyness, that Susan had to take her, and Annie to play bo-peep\r\nwith her, before she would let anyone\xe2\x80\x99s voice be heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve taken you by surprise, Miss Fosbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, shaking\r\nhands with her in the midst of the clatter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is such a pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d she began.  \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you left Mrs. Merrifield\r\nmuch better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better, much better, thank you.  I hope to find her on the sofa\r\nwhen I go back on Thursday.  I could only run down for a few days, just\r\nto settle things, and see the children, before I join the _Ramilies_.\r\nAdmiral Penrose very good-naturedly kept it open for me, till we could\r\ntell how _she_ was,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, with rather a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are going!  O Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, looking up at him; \xe2\x80\x9cand Baby\r\nwill not know you till\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, Miss Croaker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, roughly but kindly;\r\nand Miss Fosbrook could see that he was as much afraid of crying himself\r\nas of letting Susan cry; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no time for that.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a gentleman on\r\nbusiness down stairs, and your Uncle John and I must go down to them\r\nagain.  We sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t want dinner; only, Sue, tell them to send in some eggs\r\nand bacon, or cold meat, or whatever there may be, for tea; and get a\r\nroom ready for your uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would have gone, but Susan called out, \xe2\x80\x9cO Papa, may we drink tea with\r\nyou, Georgy and all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t make a bear-fight, any of you, for your\r\nuncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayn\xe2\x80\x99t I come down with you?\xe2\x80\x9d added Sam, looking at him as if he wanted\r\nto make the most of every moment of that presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter not, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got law business to settle,\r\nand we don\xe2\x80\x99t want you.  Better stay and make yourselves decent for\r\ntea-time.  Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s love, and she hopes you\xe2\x80\x99ll not drive Uncle John\r\ndistracted.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother Uncle John!\xe2\x80\x9d first muttered Sam (I am sorry to say).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think what he\xe2\x80\x99s come for,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo spoil our fun,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Johnnie disconsolately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take Sam to school,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hal, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile I go to sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you are going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.  \xe2\x80\x9cPapa said nothing\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but I know I shall.  Admiral Penrose promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know a great many things that don\xe2\x80\x99t happen.  You knew Colonel Carey\r\nwould give you two sovereigns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry looked as if he could bite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall finish Purday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, turning away with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthey shall have him for tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTea will be no fun!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Annie.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! what does Uncle John\r\ncome here for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay not he come to be with his brother?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Christabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but they are grown up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t he have him in London, without coming here to worry us in our\r\nlittle time!\xe2\x80\x9d added Johnnie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he will not worry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d they all cried, and stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe plagues about manners,\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted Susie and me to be sent to school!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said it was like dining with young Hottentots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told Papa it was disgraceful, when we had all been sliding on the\r\ngreat pond in the village,\xe2\x80\x9d added Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he gave Sam a box on the ear, for only just taking a dear little\r\nriver cray-fish in his fishing-net to show Aunt Alice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe net was dripping wet,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Bessie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Aunt Alice is so finikin and fidgety; she never\r\nwets her feet, and can\xe2\x80\x99t get over a stile, and is afraid of a cow; and he\r\nwants us all to be like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he makes Papa and Mamma mind things that they don\xe2\x80\x99t mind by nature,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma always tells us to be good, and never play at hockey in the house\r\nwhen he\xe2\x80\x99s there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has not told us so this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said John triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but we must mind all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; and Sam silenced some\r\nindependent murmurs, about not minding Uncle John, by saying it was\r\nminding Mamma.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook herself was a little alarmed, for she gathered that Mamma\r\nwas in some fear of this terrible uncle, that he had much influence with\r\nhis brother, and was rather a severe judge of the young family.  She\r\nsincerely hoped that he would not find things much amiss, for the honest\r\ngoodness of the two eldest had won so much regard from her, that she\r\ncould not bear them to be under any cloud; and indeed she felt as if the\r\nwhole flock were her own property, as well as her charge, and that she,\r\nas well as they, were about to be tried.  She would have felt it all fair\r\nand just before their kindly father, but it seemed hard that all should\r\nbe brought before the school-master uncle; and she was disposed to be\r\ntender for her children, and exceedingly anxious as to the effect they\r\nmight produce.  She was resolved that the Captain should hear of the\r\naffair of the pence; but the presence of his brother would make the\r\nspeaking a much greater effort.  Meantime, she saw that all the fingers\r\nwere clean, and all the hair brushed.  She flattered herself that Susan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyellow locks had learnt that it was the business of hair to keep tidy,\r\nand had been much less unmanageable of late; but she had her fears that\r\nthey would ruffle up again when their owner, at the head of a large\r\ndetachment, rushed out to take the \xe2\x80\x9cfancy bread\xe2\x80\x9d out of the oven, and she\r\ncame half-way down stairs, in case it should be necessary to capture\r\nthem, and brush them over again.\r\n\r\nWhile thus watching, the door of the dining-room (the only down stairs\r\nroom in order) opened suddenly, and the Captain came forth.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss\r\nFosbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cplease come in here: I was just coming to look for\r\nyou.  My brother\xe2\x80\x94Miss Fosbrook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, Miss Fosbrook received a very pleasant civil greeting\r\nfrom a much younger man than she had expected to see, looking perhaps\r\nmore stern about the mouth and sharp about the eye than his elder\r\nbrother, and his clerical dress very precise; but somehow he was so\r\ncuriously like his niece, Elizabeth, that she thought that his\r\nparticularity might spring from the same love of refinement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll going on well?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairly well,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.  \xe2\x80\x9cSam and Susan are most excellent children.\r\nThere is only one matter on which I should like to speak to you, at some\r\ntime when it might suit you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it about this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting into her hand a sheet written in\r\nhuge round-hand in pencil, no words misspelt, but the breaks in them at\r\nthe end of the lines perfectly regardless of syllables:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    My dear Papa,\r\n\r\n    Please let me\r\n    have a poli\r\n    ceman.  Bet h\r\n    as got at Toby\r\n    and stole our\r\n    pence which was\r\n    for a secret.  Nu\r\n    rse says she is a\r\n    favourite and Miss\r\n    Fosbrook will not\r\n    find them.\r\n\r\n                                                     Your affectionate son\r\n                                                 DAVID DOUGLAS MERRIFIELD.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! this was the letter David insisted on sealing before I put it into\r\nmine!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Fosbrook, as soon as she had made out the words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been in great trouble at the loss; but we agreed not to write to\r\nyou, because you had so much on your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Bessie in fault?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; none of us believe it; but I am very anxious that you should\r\nmake an investigation, for the maids suspect her, and have made the\r\nyounger children do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is Toby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToby is only a jug\xe2\x80\x94called Toby Fillpot, I believe\xe2\x80\x94shaped like a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know!\xe2\x80\x9d put in Mr. John Merrifield, laughing.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember him,\r\nHarry?  We had the like in our time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d interrogated the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust after you left home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel, as shortly and clearly as\r\nshe could, \xe2\x80\x9cthe children agreed to save their allowance to buy a pig for\r\nHannah Higgins.  They showed great perseverance in their object; and by\r\nthe third week they had about seven shillings in this jug, which, to my\r\ngrief and shame, I let them keep in the glass cupboard, not locked, but\r\none door bolted, the other buttoned.  On Friday morning, the 11th, I know\r\nthe cup was full of coppers and silver, for I took it down to add\r\nsomething to it.  On the next Monday morning the money was gone, all but\r\none farthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you guess who took it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should prefer saying nothing till you have examined the children and\r\nservants for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.  \xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x94I am sorry to treat you to a\r\ncourt-martial, John, but I must hold one after tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristabel pitied the children for having to speak before this formidable\r\nuncle; but there could be no help for it, since no other sitting-room was\r\nhabitable, and there were torrents of rain out-of-doors.\r\n\r\nThere was just time to show the glass cupboard, and the shelf where Toby\r\nhad stood, and to return to the dining-room, before the children began to\r\nstream in and make their greetings to their uncle, Susan with George in\r\none hand, and her plate of bakings in the other.  Very fancy bread indeed\r\nit was! as Uncle John said.  The edge of Purday\xe2\x80\x99s hat had been quite\r\nbaked off, and one of his arms was gone; he was black in the wrong\r\nplaces, and was altogether rather an uncomfortable-looking object.\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s brood of rabbits were much more successful, though the ears of\r\nmany had fallen off.  Uncle John was very much diverted, and took his\r\nfull share of admiring and tasting the various performances.  On the\r\nwhole, the meal went off much better than Christabel had feared it would.\r\nShe had really broken the children of many of the habits with which they\r\nused to make themselves disagreeable; there was no putting of spoons into\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s cups, nor reaching out with buttery fingers; lips were\r\nwiped, and people sat still upon their chairs, even if they fidgeted and\r\nsighed; and there was only one slop made all tea-time, and that was by\r\nJohnnie, and not a very bad one.  Indeed, it might be hoped that Mr.\r\nMerrifield did not see it, for he was talking to Sam about the change of\r\nfootpath that Mr. Greville was making.  There was indeed no fun, but it\r\nmight be doubted whether Papa would have been in a mood for fun even had\r\nhis brother not been there; and Miss Fosbrook was rather glad there was\r\nnothing to make the children forgetful of propriety.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mary had carried off the tea-things and wiped the table, Uncle\r\nJohn put himself as much out of the way as he could behind the newspaper\r\nin the recess of the window; and Miss Fosbrook would have gone to the\r\nschool-room, but Captain Merrifield begged her to stay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a very unpleasant thing has taken place in my\r\nabsence, and I wish to learn all that I can about it, that the guilty\r\nperson may be brought to light, and the innocent cleared from any\r\nsuspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children looked at one another, wondering how he had heard, or\r\nwhether Miss Fosbrook had told him; but this was soon answered by his\r\ncalling out, \xe2\x80\x9cDavid! come here, and tell me what you meant by this\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid walked stoutly to his father\xe2\x80\x99s knee, nothing daunted, though his\r\nbrothers muttered behind him, \xe2\x80\x9cSo he wrote!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLittle sneak!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHe knew\r\nno better!\xe2\x80\x9d  Not that it was wrong to lay the case before his father; but\r\nboys had usually rather suffer injustice than make an accusation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you write this letter, David?\xe2\x80\x9d said his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I want my pence for the pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me how you lost them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBess took them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth sprung up, crimson, and with tears in her eyes, and Sam and\r\nSusan were both bursting out into an angry \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d but their father\r\nmade a sign to all to keep still; and they obeyed, though each of the\r\nelder ones took hold of a hand of their sister and squeezed it hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see her take them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you say she did?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to frighten you, David; I\r\nonly want to hear why you think she did so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid was getting alarmed now, and his childish memory better retained\r\nthe impression than what had produced it.  He hung down his head, scraped\r\none foot, and finding that he must answer, mumbled out at last, \xe2\x80\x9cNurse\r\nsaid it, and Hal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry, come here.  Did you accuse your sister to David?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Henry at once; but there was a rounding of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth to cry out Oh! and he quickly added, in a hasty scared way, \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nleast, when Davie came bothering me, I said he had better ask Betty,\r\nbecause she had been prying about, and meddling with the baby-house.  I\r\nnever meant that she had done it; but Davie is such a little jack-ass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see her meddle with the baby-house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said that herself,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, starting forward, \xe2\x80\x9cI did find the doors of\r\nthe baby-house open, and shut them up, but I never touched anything in\r\nit!  Sam and Susie know I would not, and that I would not tell a story\r\nnow, though I once did, you know, Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Merrifield still kept his grave set face, and only asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\ndid you find the doors open?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Friday, Papa\xe2\x80\x94Friday week\xe2\x80\x94St. Barnabas\xe2\x80\x99 Day\xe2\x80\x94just after dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas no one with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came up-stairs first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I wanted my pencil before\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and she stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore Miss Fosbrook went in to speak to Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, getting\r\nred all over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHal had been dining in the school-room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9con account\r\nof a little bit of disobedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Merrifield looked keenly at Henry, who tried to return the look,\r\nbut shuffled uncomfortably under it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Hal had been dining in the school-room?  Was he there when you came\r\nin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere the doors open when you were dining there, Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x94no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure that you did not meddle with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know why I should,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, hastily and confusedly.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nonly the girls and the babies that have things there\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and Miss\r\nFosbrook herself had been at the cupboard in the morning; why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe have left it undone herself, and the doors got open?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cif they aren\xe2\x80\x99t fastened they always burst open\r\ndirectly; and we never could have been in the room half the morning\r\nwithout noticing them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are certain that they were closed when you went down to\r\ndinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone was positive that the great glass doors flying out must have\r\nmade themselves observed in that room full of children, especially as\r\nSusan remembered that she had been making a desk of the sloping part\r\nunder them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes anyone remember how long it was between Hal\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the room and\r\nBessie\xe2\x80\x99s coming up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know when he went out,\xe2\x80\x9d said all those who had been in the\r\ndining-room; but there spoke up a voice, quite proud of having something\r\nto tell among the others\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI saw Hal go out, and Bessie come up directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Johnnie!  How was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook made me dine in the nursery, Papa, because Hal and I had\r\nbeen riding on the new iron gate, to see if the telegraph would come in\r\nwhile the others were at church; and then Hal ran away with the\r\nGrevilles, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get down till Sam came and helped me; and so\r\nMiss Fosbrook made me dine in the nursery; and when I had done, I went\r\nand sat upon the top of the garret stairs, to watch when they came out\r\nfrom dinner, and ask if I might come down again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you see, Johnnie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, I saw a wasp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnnie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the wasp.  Did you see when Henry went out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him come in first,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, \xe2\x80\x9cand Miss Fosbrook order him up and\r\nsay she would send him his dinner, and come and speak to him presently.\r\nSo I watched to catch her when she was coming up to him, and I saw Mary\r\nbring him up some mince veal, and the last bit of the gooseberry pie; and\r\nthen, very soon, he bolted right downstairs.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he could\r\nhave had time to eat the pie; and I was going to see if there was a bit\r\nleft, when I saw Bessie coming up, and I whipped up again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen nobody went into the room between Henry and Bessie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole room was quite silent.  There was no sound but a quick short\r\nbreathing from the Captain: but he had rested his brow upon his hand, and\r\nhis face could not be seen.  It was as if something terrible had flashed\r\nupon him, and he was struggling with the first shock, and striving to\r\ndeal with it.  If they had seen him in a tempest, with his ship driving\r\nto pieces on a rock, he would not have been thus shaken and dismayed.\r\nHowever, by the time he looked up again, he had brought his face back to\r\nits resolute firmness, and he spoke in a clear, stern, startling voice,\r\nthat made all the children quake, and some catch hold of each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands: \xe2\x80\x9cHenry! tell me what you have done with your theft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiserable Henry!  He did not try to deny it any longer; but burst out\r\ninto a loud sobbing cry, \xe2\x80\x9cO Papa!  Papa!  I meant to have put it back\r\nagain!  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what you have done with it!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I paid it to Farmer Grice; I was obliged; and I thought I could have\r\nput it back again; and some of it was my own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFivepence-farthing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried David.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou thief, you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child\xe2\x80\x99s fists were clenched, and his young face all one scowl of\r\npassion, quite shocking to see.  His father put him aside, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, David! no names.\xe2\x80\x94Now, Henry, what do you say to your sister for\r\nyour false accusation, which has thrown your own shame on her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no, Papa; he never did accuse me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bessie, for the first\r\ntime bursting into tears.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe never said I did it; that was only Davie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfancy; and it has made Susie and Sam so kind, I have not minded it at\r\nall.  Please don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away, Henry!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cnow that your sister has been\r\ncleared, we had better have the rest out of the sight of these\r\ntender-hearted little girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood up, and without a word, stroked down Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s smooth brown\r\nhair, raised her face up by the chin, and kissed her forehead, the only\r\nplace free from tears; then he took Henry by the shoulder, and marched\r\nhim out of the room.  Bessie could not stop herself from crying, and was\r\nafraid of letting Uncle John see her; so she flew out after them, and\r\nstraight up-stairs to her own room.  Miss Fosbrook and Susan both longed\r\nto follow her, but they had missed this opportunity; and the sound of\r\nvoices outside showed so plainly that the Captain and Henry were in the\r\nhall that they durst not open the door.\r\n\r\nEveryone was appalled, and nothing was said for a few seconds.  The first\r\nto speak was Annie, in a low, terror-stricken whisper, yet with some\r\ncuriosity in it: \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what Papa will do to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him nine dozen, I hope!\xe2\x80\x9d answered David through his small white\r\nteeth, all clenched together with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Davie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou should not wish anything so dreadful\r\nfor your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been so wicked!  I wish it!  I _will_ wish it!\xe2\x80\x9d said David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, David!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9csuch things must not be said.  I will\r\ntalk to you by and by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad poor Bessie is cleared!\xe2\x80\x9d added Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cthough I always knew\r\nshe could not have done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure\xe2\x80\x94I knew it was Hal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam! you did?\xe2\x80\x94why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94to say\xe2\x80\x94sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cand I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go and get him into a\r\nscrape.  I thought he might tell himself, if he could ever make up the\r\nmoney again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; \xe2\x80\x9che would have done that.  He always fancied he should\r\nget a sovereign from Colonel Carey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe talked till he thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what made you guess he had done so, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndid suspect him myself, but I never felt justified in accusing him of\r\nsuch a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!  I saw he had been getting into a fix with those\r\nGrevilles, and had been sold somehow.  They said something, and got out\r\nof my way directly, and I was sure they had done some mischief, and left\r\nhim to pay the cost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ask him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the use?  One never knows where to have him.  He will eat up\r\nhis words as fast as he says them, with his _at least_, till he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what he means.  Nor I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know much of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how you could let poor Bessie live under such a\r\ncloud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cnor anyone worth a snap of my finger.\r\nBesides, if I had known, and had to tell, what a horrid shame it would\r\nhave been if the naval cadetship had been to be had for him!  I knew\r\nBessie would have thought so too, and then he would have been out of the\r\nway of the Grevilles, and would have got some money to make it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen is there no chance of the cadetship now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we should have heard of it long ago if there had been!  So I mind\r\nthe coming out the less; but it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly abominable to have had all\r\nthis row, and for Papa to be so cut up in this little short time at\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw him more grieved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Merrifield.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe was hardly more\r\novercome when your mother was at the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey started, for they had forgotten Uncle John, or they would never have\r\nspoken so freely; but he now put down his newspaper, and looked as if he\r\nmeant to talk.\r\n\r\nSusan ventured to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd indeed they had all been so very good before.\r\nThe pig made them so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA learned pig, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d said her uncle, laughing good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were obliged to take care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cor we got so many fines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristabel, finding that Mr. Merrifield looked at her, helped out Susan\r\nby explaining that various small delinquencies were visited with fines,\r\nand that the desire to save for the pig had rendered the children very\r\ncareful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was thankful for the incentive, but I am afraid\r\nthat it was over-worked, and did harm in the end:\xe2\x80\x9d and she glanced\r\ntowards David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the way with secondary motives,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\nHere Captain Merrifield came back alone; and his brother was the only\r\nperson who ventured to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have sent him to his room,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very bad\r\nbusiness, though of course he made excuses to himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain then told them Henry\xe2\x80\x99s confession.  He had been too much\r\nhurried by the fear of being caught, to take out his own share of the\r\nhoard, and had therefore emptied the whole cupful into his\r\npocket-handkerchief, tied it up, and run off with it, intending to\r\nseparate what was honestly his own.  What that was he did not know, but\r\nhis boastful habits and want of accuracy had made his memory so careless,\r\nthat he fancied that a far larger proportion was his than really was, and\r\nhis purposes were in the strange medley that falls to the lot of all\r\nself-deceivers, sometimes fancying he would only take what he had a right\r\nto (whatever that might be), sometimes that he would borrow what he\r\nwanted, and replace it when the sovereign should be given to him, or that\r\nthe Grevilles would make it up when they had their month\xe2\x80\x99s allowance.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the farm Mr. Grice was resolved to take nothing less than\r\nthe whole sum that he had with him.  Perhaps this was less for the value\r\nof the turkey-cock than for the sake of giving the boys such a lesson as\r\nto prevent them from ever molesting his poultry again.  At any rate, he\r\nwas inexorable till the frightened Henry had delivered up every farthing\r\nin his possession; and then, convinced that no more was forthcoming, he\r\nrelented so far as to restore the gun, and promise to make no complaint\r\nto either of the fathers.\r\n\r\nAt first Henry lived on hopes of being able to restore the money before\r\nthe hoard should be examined, but Colonel Carey went away, and, as might\r\nhave been expected, left no present to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s pupils.  Still Henry\r\nhad hopes of the Grevilles, and even when the loss was discovered, hoped\r\nto restore it secretly, and make the whole pass off as a joke; but the\r\n1st of August came, Martin and Osmond received their pocket-money, but\r\nlaughed his entreaty to scorn, telling him that he had shot the\r\nturkey-cock, not they.  Since that time, his only hope had been in the\r\naffair blowing over\xe2\x80\x94as if a sin ever _did_ blow over!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne question I must ask, Miss Fosbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthough after\r\nsuch a course of deceit it hardly makes it worse.  Has he told any direct\r\nfalsehood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, and recollected.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid he did;\r\nhe flatly told me that he had not touched the baby-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain gravely.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of\r\nBessie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ran up-stairs.  May I go and call her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father.\r\n\r\nHe found Elizabeth in the school-room, all flushed and tear-stained in\r\nthe face; and he told her affectionately how much pleased he was with her\r\npatience under this false accusation.  Delight very nearly set her off\r\ncrying again, but she managed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was Miss Fosbrook and Sam and\r\nSusie that made me patient, Papa; they were so kind.  And nobody would\r\nhave believed it, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always cross, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot cross now, my little woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  I said I never could be cross again, now Mamma is better; but Miss\r\nFosbrook says I shall sometimes feel so, and I do believe she is right,\r\nfor I was almost cross to Georgie to-day.  But she says one may _feel_\r\ncross, and not _be_ cross!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not quite know all that his little girl was thinking of; but he\r\npatted her fondly, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is a great deal to be thankful\r\nfor, my dear; and I shall trust to you elder ones to give your Mamma no\r\ntrouble while I am afloat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd please, Papa, would you tell Nurse about\r\nit?  She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t half believe us, and she is so tiresome about Miss\r\nFosbrook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTiresome! what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe always thinks what she does is wrong, and she puts nonsense into\r\nJohnnie\xe2\x80\x99s head, and talks about favourites.  Mary told Susan it was\r\njealousy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain spoke pretty strongly to Nurse Freeman that evening, but it\r\nis doubtful if she were the better for it.  She was a very good woman in\r\nmost things, but she could not bear that the children should be under\r\nanyone but herself; and just as Henry lost the truth by inaccuracy, she\r\nlost it by prejudice.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook was glad to get away from the dining-room, where it was\r\nrather awful to sit without her work and be talked to by Mr. Merrifield,\r\neven though she liked him much better than she had expected.\r\n\r\nWhen David came to bed, she sat by him and talked to him about his angry\r\nunforgiving spirit.  She could not but think he was in a fearful temper,\r\nand she tried hard to make him sorry for his brother, instead of\r\nthirsting to see the disappointment visited on him; but David could not\r\nsee what she meant.  Wicked people ought to be punished; it was wicked to\r\nsteal and tell stories, and he hoped Henry would be punished, so as he\r\nwould never forget it, for hindering poor Hannah from getting her pig.\r\n\r\nHe would not understand Henry\xe2\x80\x99s predicament; he was only angry, bitterly\r\nangry, and watching for vengeance.  Miss Fosbrook could not reason or\r\npersuade him out of it, nor make him see that he could hardly say his\r\nprayers in such a mood.  Indeed, he would rather have gone without his\r\nprayers than have ceased to hope for Henry\xe2\x80\x99s punishment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in this there was sense of justice and indignation against wrong\r\ndoing, as well as personal resentment.  Miss Fosbrook tried to think so,\r\nand left him, but not without praying for him, that a Christian temper of\r\nforgiveness might be sent upon him.\r\n\r\nAll the others were subdued and awe-struck.  It was not yet known what\r\nwas to happen to Henry; but there was a notion that it would be very\r\nterrible indeed, and that Uncle John would be sure to make it worse; and\r\nthey wished Miss Fosbrook good-night with very sad faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTHING had as yet befallen Henry, for he came down to breakfast in the\r\nmorning; but his father did not greet him, and spoke no word to him all\r\nthe time they were in the room together.  The children felt that this was\r\nindeed terrific.  Such a thing had never befallen any of them before.\r\nThey would much rather have been whipped; and even David\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank.\r\n\r\nSomething, however, was soon said that put all else out of his sisters\xe2\x80\x99\r\nminds.  The Captain turned to them with his merry smile, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPray\r\nwhat would Miss Susie and Miss Bessie say to coming up to London with me\r\nto see Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two girls bounded upon their chairs; Susan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes grew round, and\r\nBessie\xe2\x80\x99s long; the one said, \xe2\x80\x9cO Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d and the other, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand they looked so overwhelmed with ecstasy, and all the three elders\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will behave discreetly, young women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan; \xe2\x80\x9cand Bessie always does.  Oh, thank you, Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandmamma should be thanked; she asked me to bring a child or two, to\r\nbe with Mamma when I go down to Portsmouth.  We had thought of Susan; but\r\nI think Betty deserves some amends for what she has undergone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, Papa! thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Susan, Sam, and David, from their\r\nhearts; John and Annie because the others did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t kick her out if she shares your berth, Sue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am so glad, Papa!  It is so nice to go together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Miss Fosbrook, will you be kind enough to rig them out?  I must\r\ndrive into Southminster at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and if you would be so good as to\r\nsee them smartened up for London there, I should be much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mere drive to the country town was a great event in itself, even\r\nwithout the almost incredible wonder that it was to lead to; and the\r\ndelights of which Ida and Miss Fosbrook had told them in London went so\r\nwildly careering through the little girls\xe2\x80\x99 brains, that they hardly knew\r\nwhat they said or did, as they danced about the house, and ran up-stairs\r\nto get ready, long before ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey had been informed that his pupils would not come to him during\r\nthe few days of their father\xe2\x80\x99s stay; and Sam begged to ride in on his\r\npony by the side of the carriage; but he was desired to fetch his books,\r\nand call Henry, as his uncle wished to give them both an examination.\r\nWas this the beginning of captivity to Uncle John?  David and Johnnie\r\nwere quite angry.  They considered it highly proper that Hal should be\r\nshut up with Uncle John, but they thought it very hard that Sam should be\r\nso used too; and Sam himself looked very round-backed, reluctant, and\r\nmiserable, partly at the task, partly at being deprived of the sight of\r\nhis father for several hours of one of those few precious days.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook wished Susan to have sat on the front seat of the old\r\nphaeton with her father; but he would not consent to this, and putting\r\nthe two little girls together behind, handed the governess to the place\r\nof honour beside him, where she felt rather shy, in spite of his bright\r\neasy manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after having flourished his whip merrily at\r\nJohnnie, Annie, and Davie, who were holding open the iron gate, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nhave had a tough job with those youngsters!  We never meant you to have\r\nbeen left so long to their mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know; I only wish I could have done better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done wonders.  My brother hardly knows where he is\xe2\x80\x94never saw\r\nthose children so mannerly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook could not show how delighted she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could hardly have ventured on taking those two girls to town unless\r\nyou had broken them in a little.  I would say nothing last night till I\r\nhad watched Susan; for my mother is particular, and if my wife was to be\r\nalways worrying herself about their manners, they had better be at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I think you may quite trust to their behaving well.  Those two\r\nand Sam are so thoroughly trustworthy, that I had no real difficulty till\r\nthis unhappy business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain wanted to talk this over with her, and hear her account of it\r\nonce more.  She gave it fully, thinking he ought to know exactly how his\r\nchildren had acted in the matter, and wishing to explain where she\r\nthought she had made mistakes.  When she had finished, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d and considered a little while; then said, \xe2\x80\x9cA thing like this brings\r\nout a great deal of character; and a new eye sometimes sees more what is\r\nin a child than those that bred him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a touchstone, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Hal!\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly; then resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve said nothing of it yet to\r\nthe boys\xe2\x80\x94but Admiral Penrose has promised to let me take out one with me.\r\nI had thought most of Hal; he seemed to me a smarter fellow, more likely\r\nto make his way than his brother; but this makes me doubt whether there\r\ncan be stuff enough in him.  I might not be able to look after him, nor\r\ndo I know what his messmates may be; and I should not choose to risk it,\r\nexcept with a boy I could thoroughly trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose young Grevilles seem to me Hal\xe2\x80\x99s bane and temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay; but if a boy is of the sort, he\xe2\x80\x99ll find someone to be his bane,\r\nwherever he goes.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no more of the Grevilles though.  If he\r\nshould not go with me, my brother John would take him into his house, and\r\nkeep a sharp look out after him.  Just tell me, if you have no objection,\r\nhow the boy strikes you.  Most people think him the most taking of the\r\nlot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9che has more ease and\r\nreadiness, and he is affectionate and warm-hearted; but then he is a\r\ngreat talker, and fond of boasting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.  I told him that was the very way he learnt falsehood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she was obliged to add, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his resolutions run\r\naway in talk.  He has not much perseverance; and he is easily led.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I believe you are right; but then what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?  I can hardly\r\nafford to lose this chance; but Sam was always backward; and I doubt his\r\neven caring to go to sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  Captain Merrifield!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! has he given you reason to think that he does?\xe2\x80\x9d  She told him how\r\nshe had found Sam struggling with his longing for the sea and his father;\r\nand how patiently the boy had resigned himself to see his brother put\r\nbefore him, and himself condemned for being too dull and slow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I say so?  I suppose he had put me past my patience with blundering\r\nover his lessons.  I never meant to make any decision; but I did not\r\nthink he wished it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said it had been his desire from the time he could remember,\r\nespecially when he felt the want of you during your last voyage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery odd; how reserved some boys are!  I declare I was vexed that it had\r\ngone out of his head; though I thought it might be for the best.  You\r\nknow I was not born to this place.  I never dreamt of it till my poor\r\nbrother Sam\xe2\x80\x99s little boy went off in a fever six years ago, and we had to\r\nsettle down here.  Before that, we meant my eldest to follow my own\r\nprofession; but when he seemed to take to the soil so kindly, I thought,\r\nafter all, he might make the happier squire for never having learnt the\r\nsmell of salt water, nor the spirit of enterprise; but if it were done\r\nalready, the first choice is due to him.  You are sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leant back and shouted out the question, \xe2\x80\x9cSue! do you know whether Sam\r\nwishes to go to sea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing he ever wished so much,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he thought it would be no use,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Susan back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use! why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Hal says Admiral Penrose promised him.  O Papa! are you going to\r\ntake Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! we can\xe2\x80\x99t get on without him!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure he would like it?\xe2\x80\x9d said her father.  \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he never\r\ncared to hear of the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to talk of it, because it makes him so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bessie, \xe2\x80\x9che burnt his dear little ship, the _Victory_,\r\nbecause he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to look at it after you said _that_, Papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter I said what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he was not smart enough to learn the ropes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery silly of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cto take in despair what was only\r\nmeant to spur him on.  I suppose now I shall find he has dawdled so much\r\nthat he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get through an examination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis shut up the mouths of both the girls, who were afraid that he might\r\nnot, since they saw a good deal of his droning habits over his lessons,\r\nand heard more of Hal\xe2\x80\x99s superior cleverness.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook ventured to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may expect a great deal of a boy who\r\nworks on a pure principle of obedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think a great deal of that youngster,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, highly\r\ngratified.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the first time I ever knew a stranger take to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not take to him as a stranger.  I thought him uncouth and dull.  I\r\nonly learnt to love and respect him, as I felt how perfectly I might rely\r\non him, and how deep and true his principles are.  If the children have\r\ngone on tolerably well in your absence, it is because he has always stood\r\nby me, and his weight of character has told on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Merrifield did not answer at once; he bit his lip, then blew his\r\nnose, and cleared his throat, before he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook, you have\r\nmade me very happy; it will make his mother so.  She always rated him so\r\nhigh, that I half thought it was a weakness for her eldest son; but\r\nthere!  I suppose he was down-hearted about this fancy of his, poor boy;\r\nand that hindered him from making the most of himself.  I wonder what\r\nsort of a figure he is cutting before his uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe town was at length reached; and the shopping was quite wonderful to\r\nthe sisters.  Miss Fosbrook found a shop where the marvellous woman\r\nundertook to send home two grey frocks trimmed with pink, by the next\r\nevening; and found two such fashionable black silk jackets, that Susie\r\nfelt quite ashamed of herself, though rather pleased; and Bessie only\r\nwished she could see her own back, it must look so like Ida\xe2\x80\x99s.  Then\r\nthere were white sleeves, and white collars, that made them feel like\r\nyoung women; and little pink silk handkerchiefs for their necks; and two\r\nstraw hats, which Miss Fosbrook undertook to trim with puffs of white\r\nribbon, and a pink rosette at each ear.  Bessie thought they would be the\r\nmost beautiful things that had ever been in her possession, and was only\r\ndreading that Sam would say they were like those on Ida Greville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndonkey\xe2\x80\x99s best harness; while Susan looked quite frightened at them,\r\nwhispered a hope that Mamma would not think them too fine, and that Miss\r\nFosbrook would not let them cost too much money; and when assured that\r\nall fell within what Papa had given to be laid out, she begged that Annie\r\nand little Sally might have the like.\r\n\r\nBut as they were not going to London, Miss Fosbrook could not venture on\r\nthis; and as Bessie had set her affections upon a certain white chip hat,\r\nwith a pink border and a white feather, both sisters remained wishing for\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x94as is sure to happen on such occasions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Elizabeth recovered from the hat when she was out of sight of\r\nit; and they went and saw the cathedral, where the painted windows and\r\ngrave grand arches filled her with a truer and wiser sense of what was\r\nbeautiful; and then they walked a long time up and down under its\r\nbuttressed wall, waiting for Papa, till they grew tired and hungry; but\r\nat last he came in a great hurry, and sorry to have been hindered.  With\r\nnaval politeness, he gave his arm to Miss Fosbrook, and carried them off\r\nto a pastry-cook\xe2\x80\x99s, where he bade them eat what they pleased, and spend\r\nthe rest of the florin he threw them on buns for the little ones, while\r\nhe fetched the carriage; and so they all drove home again, and found the\r\nrest of the party ravenous, having waited dinner for three-quarters of an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nWonderful to relate, Uncle John had not eaten anybody up! not even Baby;\r\nthough Papa advised Susan to make sure that she was safe, and then sent\r\nSam to ask Purday for a salad.  Perhaps this was by way of getting rid of\r\nthis constant follower while he asked his brother what he thought of the\r\nboys\xe2\x80\x99 attainments.\r\n\r\nUncle John could not speak very highly of the learning of either; but he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cSam knows thoroughly what he does know.  As to the other, he\r\nthinks he knows everything, and makes most awful shots.  When I asked\r\nthem who Dido\xe2\x80\x99s husband was, Sam told me he did not know, and Hal, that\r\nhe was Diodorus Siculus\xe2\x80\x94_at least_, Scipio\xe2\x80\x94no, he meant Sicyon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you think neither could stand an examination for the cadetship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not be sure of Sam; but I am quite sure that Hal could not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the dinner-bell rang; the hungry populace rushed to the dining-room,\r\nand the meal was gone through as merrily as could be, while still the\r\nfather never spoke to Henry.  Uncle John was as pleasant and good-natured\r\nas possible.  Who would have thought of the marked difference he made\r\nbetween dining with barbarians, or young gentlefolks!\r\n\r\nDinner over, Captain Merrifield called Sam,\xe2\x80\x94or rather, since that was not\r\nnecessary, as Sam was never willingly a yard from his elbow, he ordered\r\nthe others not to follow as they went into the garden together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAdmiral Penrose is kind enough to offer me a berth in\r\nthe _Ramilies_ for one of you.  If you can pass the examination, should\r\nyou wish to avail yourself of the offer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam grew very red in the face, looked down, and twirled the button of his\r\nsleeve.  He certainly was not a gracious boy, for all he said was in a\r\ngruff hoarse voice, without even thanks, \xe2\x80\x9cNot if it is for this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor this!  What do you mean, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Merrifield, thinking\r\neither that the boy was faint-hearted, or that his wish had been the mere\r\nfancy of the girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if it is to punish Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, with another effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the question.  Do you wish it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam hung his head, and made his eyebrows come down, as if they were to\r\nserve as a veil to those horrid tears in his eyes; and after all, his\r\nvoice sounded sulky, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, angry and disappointed.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the\r\nway you take such an offer?  If you had rather stay here, and be bred up\r\nto be a country squire, say so at once; don\xe2\x80\x99t mince the matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sam indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you think that?  Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nalways want to be like you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why can\xe2\x80\x99t you say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to cut Hal out!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, putting his arm over his\r\neyes, as a way he considered secret of disposing of his tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut that out of your head, Sam; or if you don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy the sea, have it\r\nout at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Papa! please listen.  You know, though Miss Fosbrook is very jolly, we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help getting nohow when you were away, _us_ two particularly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no mischief to confess, surely, Sam?\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, really\r\nimagining that this preference to Hal was acting on him so as to make him\r\nmention some concealed misdemeanour; \xe2\x80\x9cif you have, you know truth is the\r\nbest line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, looking up, quite surprised.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nI am a year older, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help caring more; and Miss Fosbrook is so\r\nnice, one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother her; but you see the Grevilles _would_ put it\r\ninto Hal\xe2\x80\x99s head that it was stupid and like a girl to mind her.  It is\r\nall their fault; and they were sneaks about the turkey-cock, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npay\xe2\x80\x94and I know he would have ended by putting the money back when he\r\ncould, only Davie made such a row before he could; and he did so reckon\r\non the navy\xe2\x80\x94he would pay it back the first thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  The last sentences\r\ncame between gasps, very like sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done with Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Merrifield, still with displeasure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take him now on any account.  If the Grevilles lead him\r\nwrong, what would he do among the mids?  If he acts dishonourably here,\r\nwe should have him disgracing himself and his profession.  Since he can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake it, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t, I shall try to make some exchange of the chance\r\ntill John or David will be old enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Papa, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want to force you to it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Captain Merrifield, in his\r\nvexed voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cI never mean to force my sons to any profession if I can\r\nhelp it; and you have a right to be considered.  It has always been a\r\ndisadvantage to me, and to this place, that I was bred to the sea instead\r\nof to farming; and though you can\xe2\x80\x99t live on the property without some\r\nprofession, it may be quite as well that you should turn your mind to\r\nsomething else\xe2\x80\x94only if it be the army, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you on in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather go to sea, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say so to please me,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father.  \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, the\r\nexaminations are a pretty deal harder than they were in my time.  It is\r\nnot a trade for a youngster to be idle in; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you, just\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve knocked about a few years, and are getting fit to be of use\r\non board and nowhere else, calling yourself heartily sick of it, and\r\nturning round to say it was my doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never do that, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Sam, unable to understand why his\r\nfather should speak as though scolding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?  And mind, you must take the rough with the smooth, if you sail with\r\nme, and not be always running after me, Papa-ing me.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t see after\r\nyou, and should only get you ill will if I tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, looking at\r\nhim in a puzzle.  \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, if you do mean to go, you may tell Freeman to\r\nget your things ready to come up with me on Thursday; only if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally like the notion, find out your own mind, and let me know in time,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain turned away, and gave a long whistle\xe2\x80\x94an accustomed\r\nsignal\xe2\x80\x94that brought children and dogs all rushing and tumbling about him\r\ntogether, to walk with him about the farm, and his brother among them;\r\nbut Sam hung back.  He had not the heart to go with that merry throng;\r\nfor he did not know whether his father were not displeased with him, and\r\nhe therefore thought he must be to blame.\r\n\r\nPeople who, like Sam, rather cultivate the habit of gruffness and\r\nreserve, and prefer to be short and rude, become so utterly unable to\r\nexpress what they mean, that on great occasions they are misunderstood,\r\nand give pain by supposed ingratitude and dislike, even when they feel\r\nmost warmly.  Captain Merrifield could only judge from looks and words;\r\nand even when Sam had been satisfied about Henry, he had shown so little\r\nalacrity or satisfaction, as really to leave a doubt whether he were not\r\nunwillingly yielding to his father\xe2\x80\x99s wishes; which would have been a\r\nmistaken act, as the Captain thought no one ought to be a sailor unless\r\nwith a very strong desire that way.  Thus Sam really perplexed and\r\ndistressed his father, when he least intended it; and unable to\r\nunderstand what was the matter, yet feeling heavy and sad, he turned\r\naside from the rest, and, by way of the quietest place he could find,\r\nclimbed up a tall pear-tree, to the very highest branch he could reach.\r\nHe put himself astride on one bough, his feet upon another below, and his\r\nback leaning against the main stem.  No one could see him up so high\r\namong the thick leaves; but he could see all around the village, and over\r\nthe house; he could look down into the farm-court at the pigs burying\r\nthemselves in the straw; and out beyond at the geese and ducks in the\r\nmeadow, and the broods of chickens pecking and scratching about, or the\r\nolder poultry rolling in the dust-holes they had scraped for themselves.\r\nHe could see Purday among his cabbages in the garden; and further off,\r\ncould watch the walking-party through the fields, his father with little\r\nGeorge in his arms, and Uncle John as often as possible by his side;\r\nwhile the others frisked about, sometimes spreading out like a flock of\r\nsheep in the pasture land, or when they came to the narrow paths in the\r\ncornfields, all getting into single file, and being lost sight of all but\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nSam recollected how, the day when he had heard that he was not likely to\r\nbe a sailor, he had felt as if he hated Stokesley, and as if it would be\r\na prison to him, and how everything reminding him of the sea had been a\r\nmisery to him.  He would not then have believed anyone who had told him\r\nthat he would really hear of his appointment and be so little glad.  Yet\r\nfor two whole years the loss of the hope had weighed on him, and made him\r\ndull whenever he thought of grown-up life, heard of the sea, or was asked\r\nwhat he was to be: and almost always, at his prayers, he had that meaning\r\nin his mind, when he said \xe2\x80\x9cThy Will be done;\xe2\x80\x9d he had really submitted\r\npatiently, and tried to put away the longing from his mind, and would,\r\nthere can be no doubt, have been happy and dutiful at home; but at length\r\nthe wish of his heart was suddenly granted.\r\n\r\nAnd then, wish though it still were, there came all this grief and\r\ndiscomfort.  The gladness was in him somewhere, but he could not get at\r\nit, either for his own comfort, or that of his father.  He missed his\r\nmother exceedingly.  _She_ would know what he meant, and tell Papa that\r\nhe did care to go.  Yet, did he care so very much?  Only think of\r\nbeginning to be a stranger at this dear old home! and seeing no mother,\r\nno Susie, nor any of them, for years together\xe2\x80\x94probably not his father\r\nafter the first voyage!  However, the sailor was too strong in Sam for\r\nthat grief not to pass off; and his chief trouble was the sense of\r\nsupplanting Henry.  He knew the disappointment would be most bitter; and\r\nhe could not get rid of the sense of having taken an unfair advantage of\r\nthe disgrace of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s adventure.  As to his father\xe2\x80\x99s manner, he got\r\nover that more easily, for his conscience was free; he knew that the tone\r\nof displeasure would be gone at the next meeting, and he was too sure of\r\nhis own love of the sea to fear that he should not show it enough.  After\r\nall, he was to be a naval cadet!  He could not be sorry.  Nay, he felt he\r\nhad his wish; the very wish he had thought it wrong to put into a prayer.\r\nHe thought he ought to be thankful that it was granted, in the same way\r\nas he had been when his mother began to recover.  So he put his hands\r\ntogether, and looked up into the summer blue sky through the leaves, and\r\nhis lips moved, as he whispered his thanks, and asked to be helped in\r\nbeing a good brave sailor, and that something as good might happen to\r\npoor Henry.\r\n\r\nAfter this, somehow, the weight was gone, he knew not where.  All he\r\nrecollected was, that he should see Mamma in two days, and that he was to\r\nsail with Papa if he could get through his examination.  There was a sort\r\nof necessity of doing something comical; and just then spying Miss\r\nFosbrook with a book walking slowly below, he could not resist the\r\ntemptation of sending down on her a shower of little hard pears and\r\ntwigs.\r\n\r\nBob came one down on her book, and another on her bonnet.  She looked up,\r\nand saw a leg stretching out for a branch, apparently in such a dangerous\r\nmanner, that she did not know whether she should not have Sam himself on\r\nher head next, and started back, watching as he swung himself from branch\r\nto branch, and then slid down, embracing the trunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I hit you!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.  \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help trying it; it was such fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a great liberty; but she was so good-humoured as to laugh, and\r\nsaid he had taken good aim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Miss Fosbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d next said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you hear how many\r\npropositions I can say!\xe2\x80\x9d  And as she opened her eyes at this holiday\r\namusement, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cPapa has got the appointment after all, and means\r\nme to have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad, Sam!  I give you joy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and took his hand to\r\nshake it heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Hal could go too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d she said kindly, and guessing his feelings, as having gone\r\nalong with them, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder you are sorry for him; but indeed I\r\nthink it is better for him to be sheltered from beginning real life just\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa said he would not have taken him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems so hard\r\nto have all his life changed for a thing that sounds worse than he meant\r\nit to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cI once read a sermon, that said that our\r\nconduct in little things does decide the tenor of our lives.  You know\r\none moment of hastiness cost Moses the Promised Land; and only a little\r\nwhile ago, we heard how Joash had but few victories allowed to him,\r\nbecause he did not think it worth while to strike the ground as often as\r\nElisha told him.  It is the little things that show whether we are to be\r\ntrusted with great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is such a tremendous punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he would have put\r\nit back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother knew a banker\xe2\x80\x99s clerk who was transported for borrowing what\r\nhe meant to put back again.  No, Sam; people must bear the result of\r\ntheir doings; and your father judges for Hal as much in kindness as in\r\nanger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he knows best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may see it as well as trust.  With all his grand talk, do you really\r\nthink that Hal would not be upset at the first hardship, or that he could\r\nface bullying or danger?  Remember the bull, that was at least a vicious\r\ncow, and turned out to be a calf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSam could not help laughing, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that would never do at\r\nsea; and he would be done for if he were cowardly there.  But I wish I\r\ncould get out of sight of him till I am gone.  And please hear my Euclid;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll get the book, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay out here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, if the two sides of two triangles be equal to one another,\r\nand the adjacent angles be equal each to each,\xe2\x80\x9d resounded through the\r\nlaurels, as the walking party returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo! _al fresco_ Euclid!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Uncle John, as Sam with a blush\r\nran after his blotted diagrams, as a sudden gust of wind blew them\r\ndancing over the garden.  Captain Merrifield caught one, and restored it\r\nto Sam, with a pat on the back that made his teeth rattle in his head,\r\nbut which made him as happy as a young sea-king, showing that they\r\nperfectly understood each other.\r\n\r\nBut to be ever so good a boy does not carry one through the examinations\r\nthat stand at the door of every road of life for those who are not\r\nwealthy.  Sam knew he was the dull boy of Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s four pupils; and\r\nthough from sheer diligence he was less often turned back than the rest,\r\nyet they could all excel him whenever they chose: his lessons all went\r\nagainst the grain, and were a sore trouble to him; and his uncle had\r\nshown much wrath to-day at his ignorance and backwardness.  He was\r\ntherefore in a great fright, and gave himself and Miss Fosbrook no peace,\r\nrunning after her every moment with his Euclid, his Colenso, or his\r\nslate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat boy will stupefy himself and his admirable cramming machine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Uncle John, when coming out into the court after tea to talk to\r\nPurday, the two brothers heard, \xe2\x80\x9cThe complement A E is equal to the\r\ncomplement D E,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding out of the school-room window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA truce with your complements to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9ccome\r\ndown, Sam; I must have a game at hide-and-seek!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough hide-and-seek on the lawn with Papa was the supremest bliss that\r\nlife had yet offered to the young Merrifields, and though Susan, Bessie,\r\nAnnie, and Johnnie, had all severally burst into the room to proclaim it\r\nand summon Sam, he had refused them all; but this call settled it; he\r\nbroke off in the middle of his rectangle, and dashed down stairs, to the\r\ngreat relief of kind Miss Fosbrook, who, with all her good-will, found\r\nher head beginning to grow weary of angles and right-angles on a hot\r\nevening in the height of summer.\r\n\r\nThe summer-house was to be _home_, and there the party were\r\nassembled\xe2\x80\x94nine in number, for not only Papa, but Uncle John, was going to\r\nplay; and Henry, though forlorn and unnoticed, had wandered about with\r\nthe rest all day, trying to do as usual, to forget the heavy load that\r\npressed on him, and to believe that he was not going to be punished for\r\nmere unluckiness in borrowing, and for not answering impertinent\r\nquestions.  The world was very unlike itself to him; and he saw the\r\nenjoyment without being able to enter into it, just as a sick person sees\r\nthe sunshine without feeling the warmth; but instead of penitence, he\r\nmerely tried to shake off his compunction.\r\n\r\nSo there he stood in the ring, as Susan was finding out who was to be the\r\nfirst to hide, by pointing to each, at each word of the formula,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cEggs, butter, cheese, bread,\r\n    Sticks, stocks, stones, dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead\xe2\x80\x9d came to Uncle John, as perhaps Susan had contrived; and shrugging\r\nup his shoulders, he went off to hide, and his whoop was presently heard.\r\nHe was not _very_ good game; maybe he did not wish to be very long\r\nsought, for he was no further than in the tall French beans, generally\r\nconsidered as a stupid place to hide in.  The children had been in hopes\r\nthat he would catch Papa, which was always a very difficult matter, for\r\nthe sailor was lighter of foot, as well as, of course, longer in limb,\r\nthan any of the children; but they saw that Uncle John had not the\r\nslightest chance with him, and it was Bessie who was caught in her\r\nhomeward race.\r\n\r\nBessie was rather a good hider, and was searched for far and wide before\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI spy!  I spy!\xe2\x80\x9d gave the signal that a bit of the spotty cotton\r\nhad been seen peeping out from under Purday\xe2\x80\x99s big potato-basket in the\r\ntool-house, and the whole party flew towards home.  Bessie would not aim\r\nat Papa, for if so, she would certainly catch no one; but she hunted down\r\nDavid, who was too sturdy to be a quick runner, and who was very well\r\npleased to be caught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as she captured him.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know of such a\r\ncunning place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s place proved to be in among his likenesses, the cabbages,\r\nimmediately in front of the summer-house.  There he lay flat on the very\r\nwet mould, among the stout cabbages, all of which had a bead of wet in\r\nevery wrinkle of their great leaves, so that when Susan had at length\r\nspied him, and he came plunging out, his brown-holland\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of\r\nhis knees\xe2\x80\x94was in a state that would have caused most mammas to send him\r\nto be instantly undressed; but nobody even saw it, and he charged\r\ninstantly towards the door of the summer-house, not pursuing anyone in\r\nparticular, but cutting all off from their retreat.  He slipped aside,\r\nhowever, and let all the lesser game pass by uncaught; his soul soared\r\nhigher than even Uncle John, who looked on exceedingly amused at the\r\nsmall man\xe2\x80\x99s stratagem, and at the long dodging that took place between\r\nhim and his father, the quick lithe Captain skipping hither and thither,\r\nand trying to pop in one side while his enemy was on the other; and the\r\nsquare, determined, little, puffing, panting boy, guarding his door,\r\nhands on knees, ever ready for a dart wherever the attempt was made.  The\r\nwhole party in the home nearly went into fits at the fun, and at the\r\ndroll remarks Uncle John made at this hare and tortoise spectacle; till\r\nat last either the Captain gave in, or Davie made a cleverer attack than\r\never, for with a great shout he flew upon Papa, and held him fast by the\r\nlegs.  Everyone shrieked with delight; Papa hid in such clever places,\r\nand when found, he roared so splendidly, that it struck the little ones\r\nwith terror, and did the hearts of the elders good, to hear him; indeed,\r\nthe greatest ambition Johnnie entertained was to roar like Papa.  Then he\r\ncould make his voice sound as if out of any place he chose, so that no\r\none could guess by his \xe2\x80\x9cwhoop\xe2\x80\x9d where to look for him; and this time it\r\nseemed to be quite out at the other end of the kitchen-garden, where they\r\nwere all looking, when another \xe2\x80\x9cwhoop\xe2\x80\x9d came apparently down from Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npear-tree on the lawn; and while they were peeping up into it, \xe2\x80\x9cwhoop\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nre-echoed from the stables!  At last, as Annie was gazing up and round as\r\nif she even thought it as well to look right into the sky for Papa, she\r\nsuddenly beheld the two merriest eyes in the world, on the roof of the\r\nsummer-house itself.  He had been lying there on the thatch, watching at\r\nhis ease all the wanderings of the seekers, and uttering those wonderful\r\nwhoops to bewilder them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spy!  I spy!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Annie, flying in, even while her father sprang\r\nto the ground, and with Davie\xe2\x80\x99s man\xc5\x93uvre on a larger scale, seemed to be\r\ntaking his choice of all the fugitives rushing up from all parts.\r\n\r\nOne elder boy, and one younger, he was hunting down the gooseberry-path,\r\nwhen just as he was about to pounce on the former, he said that it was\r\nnot Sam, stood still, and folded his arms.  A shriek made him look round;\r\nlittle David stood sobbing and crying piteously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavie! what, Davie!  What is it, my man?  Where are you hurt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!  I\xe2\x80\x99m not hurt!  Catch Hal, Papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, David.  I do not play with boys that act like Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to him, Papa; oh, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall, before I go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now!  Papa.  Oh, do!  I did want him to be punished, but not like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, David.  If he can expect to play with me, and be treated like the\r\nothers, he is not in the state to receive forgiveness.  There, have done\r\ncrying; let us go on with the game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut David could not go on playing; he was too unhappy.  Not to be\r\nforgiven, even if punished, seemed to him too dreadful to happen to\r\nanyone; and he thought that he had brought it all on Henry by his letter\r\nof accusation.  Tardily and dolefully he crept into the house; and Miss\r\nFosbrook met him, looking so woe-begone, that she too thought he had hurt\r\nhimself.  She took him, dirt and all, on her lap; and there he sobbed out\r\nthat Papa wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to Hal, and it was very dreadful; and he wished\r\nthere were no such things as pigs, or money, or secrets; they only made\r\npeople miserable!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Davie, they only make people miserable when they care too much\r\nabout them.  Papa will forgive Hal before he goes away, I am sure; only\r\nhe is making him sorry first, that he may never do such a thing again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d  And David cried sadly, perhaps because partly he was\r\ntired with having been on his legs more than usual that day; but his good\r\nand loving little self was come home again.  He at least had forgiven his\r\nbrother the wrong done to himself; and there was no hanging back that\r\nnight from the fulness of prayer; no, he rather felt that he had been\r\nunkind; and the last thing heard of him that night was, that as Sam and\r\nHal were coming up-stairs to bed, a little white figure stood on the top\r\nof the stairs, and a small voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cHal, please kiss me!  I am so\r\nsorry I told Papa about\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal, cutting him short with the desired\r\nkiss, \xe2\x80\x9cif you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told, someone else would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut long after Sam was asleep, Hal was wetting his pillow through with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILL the silence lasted.  Henry had tried at first to persuade himself\r\nthat it was only by chance that he never heard his own name from lips\r\nthat used to call it more often than any other.  Indeed, he was so much\r\nused to favour, that it needed all the awe-struck pity of the rest to\r\nprove to him its withdrawal; and he was so much in the habit of thrusting\r\nhimself before Samuel, that even the sight and sound of the First Book of\r\nEuclid, all day long, failed to convince him that his brother could be\r\npreferred; above all, as Nurse Freeman had been collecting his clean\r\nshirts as well as Sam\xe2\x80\x99s, and all the portmanteaus and trunks in the house\r\nhad been hunted out of the roof.  Once, either the spirit of imitation,\r\nor his usual desire of showing himself off, made him break in when Sam\r\nwas knitting his brows frightfully over a sum in proportion.  Hal could\r\ndo it in no time!\r\n\r\nSo he did; but he put the third term first, and multiplied the hours into\r\nthe minutes, instead of reducing them to the same denomination; so that\r\nhe made out that twenty-five men would take longer to cut a field of\r\ngrass than three, and then could not see that he was wrong; but Miss\r\nFosbrook and Sam both looked so much grieved for him, that a start of\r\nfright went through him.\r\n\r\nSome minds really do not understand a fault till they see it severely\r\nvisited; and \xe2\x80\x9c_at least_\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help_\xe2\x80\x9d had so blinded Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes that he had thought himself more unlucky than to blame, till his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s manner forced it on him that he had done something dreadful.\r\nVaguely afraid, he hung about, looking so wretched that he was a piteous\r\nsight; and it cut his father to the heart to spend such a last day\r\ntogether.  Mayhap the Captain could hardly have held out all that second\r\nday, if he had not passed his word to his brother.\r\n\r\nThe travellers were to set off at six in the morning, to meet the\r\nearliest train: and it was not till nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, when the four\r\nelder ones said good-night, that the Captain, following them out of the\r\nroom, laid his hand on Henry as the others went up-stairs, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry, have you nothing to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry leant against the baluster and sobbed, not knowing what else to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be more grieved than I am to have such a last day together,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid his father, laying his hand on the yellow head; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit, you see.  If you will do such things, it is my duty to make you\r\nrepent of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHal threw himself almost double over the rail, and something was heard\r\nabout \xe2\x80\x9csorry,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said his father aloud to himself; \xe2\x80\x9che is cut up enough\r\nnow; but how am I to know if his sorrow is good for anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Papa!  I\xe2\x80\x99ll never do such a thing again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I knew that, Hal,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, sitting down on the stairs,\r\nand taking him between his knees.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere, let us talk it over together.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you expected to steal and deceive when you got up in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to the beginning.  See how you came to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he waited for an answer, Hal mumbled out after some time, \xe2\x80\x9cYou said we\r\nneed not go to church on a week-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t go in case the telegraph should come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are different ways of thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father.  \xe2\x80\x9cChurch was the\r\nonly place where I _could_ have gone that St. Barnabas\xe2\x80\x99 Day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the self-contradictory Henry, \xe2\x80\x9conly the\r\nGrevilles are always at one for being like a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! now we see daylight!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Grevilles are at one,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s more like getting to the bottom of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal, glad to make himself out a victim to circumstance;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t think what a pair of fellows those are for not letting one\r\nalone; Purday says they haven\xe2\x80\x99t as much conscience between them as a\r\npigeon\xe2\x80\x99s egg has meat; and going down to Mr. Carey\xe2\x80\x99s with them every day,\r\nthey let one have no peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find people everywhere who will let you have no peace, unless\r\nyou do not care for them; though you will not be left to the Grevilles\r\nany longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Papa; when I am away from them, you will see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Hal, I shall not see, I shall hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall not I sail with you, then, Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not sail at all: I thought you knew that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought the Admiral must have given you two appointments,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hal\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me _one_, for one of my sons.  The first choice is Sam\xe2\x80\x99s right,\r\neven if he had not deserved it by his brave patient obedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHal hung his head; then said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Papa, if Sam broke down in his\r\nexamination, please mightn\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Henry.  Not only does your uncle say that though Sam\xe2\x80\x99s success is\r\nvery doubtful, your inaccuracy would make your failure certain; but if\r\nyour knowledge were ever so well up to the mark, I could not put you into\r\nthe navy.  Left to yourself here, you have been insubordinate, vain,\r\nweak, shuffling: can I let you go into greater temptation, where disgrace\r\nwould be public and without remedy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but, Papa!  Papa!  Away from the Grevilles, and not under only a\r\ngoverness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be away from the Grevilles, and not under a governess.  Your\r\nuncle is kind enough to take you with him to his house, and will\r\nendeavour to make you fit to try to get upon the foundation by the time\r\nthere is a vacancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Papa! don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, Hal!  You have shown yourself unfit either for the sea\r\nor for home.  What can I do with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry me\xe2\x80\x94only try me, Papa.  I would\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot go by what you say you would be, but what you are.  Deeds, not\r\nwords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you won\xe2\x80\x99t let me go into the navy, only let me be in real\r\nschool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Henry; I have not the means of sending you there: excepting on the\r\nfoundation; and if you get admittance there at all, it will only be by\r\ngreat diligence, and your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s kindness in preparing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry cried bitterly.  It was a dreadful prospect to do his lessons alone\r\nwith Uncle John in the boys\xe2\x80\x99 play-hours, and be kept in order by Aunt\r\nAlice when his uncle was in school.  Perhaps his father would not have\r\nliked it himself, for his voice was very pitying, though cheering, as he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cOne half year, Hal, very likely no more if you take pains, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get into school, and be very happy, so long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t make a\r\nGreville of every idle chap you meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry cried as though beyond consolation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate leaving you this way,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his father; \xe2\x80\x9cbut by the time I\r\ncome home you will see it was the best thing for you; and look up to\r\nUncle John as your best friend.  Why, Hal, boy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a tall fellow\r\nof fourteen!  Let me find you godly and manly: you can\xe2\x80\x99t be one without\r\nthe other.  There now, good night, God bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore might have been said to Henry on his fault and what had led to it;\r\nbut what his father did say was likely to sink deeper as he grew older,\r\nand had more sense and feeling.\r\n\r\nFrom him Captain Merrifield went to the school-room, where Miss Fosbrook\r\nwas packing up for the little girls, and putting last stitches to their\r\nequipments, with hearty good-will and kindness, as if she had been their\r\nelder sister.\r\n\r\nHe thanked her most warmly; and without sending away the girls, who were\r\nboth busy tacking in little white tuckers to the evening frocks, he began\r\nto settle about the terms on which she was to remain at Stokesley.  He\r\nsaid that he could not possibly have left his wife without a person on\r\nwhose friendly help and good management of the children he could depend.\r\nImportant as it was to him to be employed, he must have refused the\r\nappointment if Miss Fosbrook had been discontented, or had not had the\r\nchildren so well in hand.  He explained that he had reason to think that\r\nMrs. Merrifield\xe2\x80\x99s present illness had been the effect of all she had gone\r\nthrough while he was in the Black Sea during the Crimean War.  She had\r\nbeen a very strong person, and had never thought of sparing herself; but\r\nshe and all her little children had had to get into Stokesley in his\r\nabsence; she had to manage the estate and farm, teach the elder children,\r\nand take care of the babies, with no help but Nurse Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s: and though\r\nhe had been wounded when with the Naval Brigade, and had been at death\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor with cholera, the effects had done him no lasting harm at all; while\r\nthe over-strain of the anxiety and exertion that she had undergone all\r\nalone had so told upon her, that she had never been well since, and he\r\nmuch feared, would never be in perfect health again.  He must depend upon\r\nMiss Fosbrook for watching over her and saving her, as his little Susie\r\ncould not yet do; and for letting him know from time to time how she was\r\ngoing on, and whether he ought to give up everything and come home.\r\n\r\nHe had tears in his eyes as he thanked Christabel for her earnest promise\r\nto watch and tend Mrs. Merrifield with a daughter\xe2\x80\x99s care; and her heart\r\nswelled with strong deep feeling of sorrow and sympathy with these two\r\nbrave-hearted loving people, doing their duty at all costs so steadily;\r\nand she was full of gladness and thankfulness that they could treat her\r\nas a true and trusty friend.  He walked away, feeling far too much to\r\nbear any eye upon him; and Susan was found to be crying quietly, making\r\nher thread wet through, and her needle squeak at every stitch, at the sad\r\nnews that Mamma never was to be quite well, even though assured that she\r\nwas likely to be much better than she had been for months past.\r\n\r\nBessie shed no tears; but Miss Fosbrook, who had been hindered all day by\r\nSam\xe2\x80\x99s Euclid and Colenso, and had sat up till half-past eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock to\r\nmake the two Sunday frocks nice enough for the journey, on going into the\r\nbed-room to lay them out for the morning, saw a little face raised from\r\nthe pillow of one of the small white beds, and found her broad awake.\r\nBessie never could go to sleep properly when anything out of the common\r\nway was coming to pass, so that was the less wonder; but she had a great\r\ndeal in her head, and she was glad to get Christabel to kneel down by\r\nher, to listen to her whispers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Christabel, I am so sorry.  I never cared about it before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout what, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Papa said about when he was in the Black Sea.  I never knew Mamma\r\ncared so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say not, my dear; you were much younger then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie, \xe2\x80\x9cor else I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten.\r\nI have been trying to remember whether we ever thought about Mamma; and\r\noh, Christabel! do you know\xe2\x80\x94I believe we only thought she was cross!  Oh\r\ndear! it was so naughty and bad of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can guess how it happened, my dear.  You were not old enough to be\r\nmade her friends, and you could not understand quiet sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think we should have said she was cross!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was wrong, because it was disrespectful.  You see, my dear, when\r\ngrown people are in trouble, you young ones can\xe2\x80\x99t enter into their\r\nfeelings, nor always even find out that anything is amiss; and you get\r\nvexed at there being a cloud over the house, and call it crossness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrown-up people are sometimes cross, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie.  \xe2\x80\x9cNurse\r\nis; and I heard Papa say Aunt Alice was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have tempers, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook; \xe2\x80\x9cand unless we have\r\nconquered them as children, there will be signs of them afterwards; but\r\nvery few people, and certainly no children, can tell when grave looks, or\r\nwords sharper than usual, come from illness or anxiety or sorrow; and it\r\nis the only way to save great grief and self-reproach to give one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nfaults the blame, and try to be as unobtrusive and obliging as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am older now, and can understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bessie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut then, it is\r\nSusie that is right hand, and does everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty in your own line, Bessie\xe2\x80\x94plenty of little kindly services\r\nthat are very cheering; and above all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttending to your Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s troubles will drive away your own grievances.\r\nOnly I will not talk to you any more now, for I want you to go to sleep;\r\nif you lie awake, you will be tired to-morrow, and that will incline you\r\nto be fretful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFretful to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBessie could not believe it possible; and indeed Miss Fosbrook did not\r\nthink the chance great, as long as there was amusement and excitement.\r\nThe danger would be in the waitings and disappointments that will often\r\noccur, even in the height of enjoyable schemes.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to tell of all the good-byes.  The children old\r\nenough to enter into the parting were setting off too; and Miss Fosbrook\r\nfelt more for the little ones than they did for themselves, as they\r\nwatched their father and uncle and two sisters into the gig, and the boys\r\ninto the cart, with Purday to drive them and the boxes, Sam sitting on\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s old midshipman\xe2\x80\x99s chest, trying, as well as the jolting would\r\nlet him, to con over that troublesome Thirty-fifth Proposition, which\r\nnine times repetition to Miss Fosbrook had failed to put into his head.\r\n\r\nJohnnie and Annie wished themselves going to sea, or to London, or\r\nanywhere, rather than having the full force of Miss Fosbrook on their\r\nlessons!  She did not make them do more, but she took the opportunity of\r\nmaking everything be done thoroughly, and, as they thought, bothered them\r\nfrightfully about pronouncing their words in reading, and holding their\r\npens when they wrote.  After a little while, however, they found that\r\nreally their hands were much less tired, and their lines much smoother\r\nand more slanting, than when they crooked their fingers close down over\r\nthe ink.  Absolutely they began to know the pleasure of doing something\r\nwell, and they felt so comfortable, that they were wonderfully good; and\r\nthe pig fund might have had a chance, but David did not seem to think of\r\nreviving it.  Perhaps his great vehemence had tired itself out; and maybe\r\nhe was ashamed of the great disturbance he had made and all that had come\r\nupon Henry, and did not wish to think of it again, for St. Katherine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfair-day passed over without a word of the pig.\r\n\r\nThe young ladies were not great letter-writers; and all that was known of\r\nthem was that Mamma was better, they had been to the Zoological Gardens\r\nand the hyena was so funny, and Mrs. Penrose was so nice.  Then that Papa\r\nand Sam were gone to Portsmouth, and that they had telegraphed that Sam\r\nhad succeeded.\r\n\r\nIf it had been her own brother, Miss Fosbrook could not have been much\r\nhappier; and in honour of it she and the three children all went to drink\r\ntea in the wilderness, walking in procession, each with a flag in hand,\r\npainted by her for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThree days after, when the post came in, there was a letter directed to\r\nMaster David Douglas Merrifield, Stokesley House, Bonchamp.  It was a\r\ngreat wonder; for David was not baby enough, nor near enough to the\r\nyoungest, to get letters as a pet, nor was he old enough to be written to\r\nlike an elder one.  He spelt the address all over before he made up his\r\nmind to open it, and then exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not a letter!  It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a post-office order, Davie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook.  \xe2\x80\x9cLet me look.\r\nYes, for ten shillings.  Write your name there; and if we take it to the\r\npost-office at Bonchamp, they will give you ten shillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen shillings!  Oh, Davie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Johnnie, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish it was to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just makes up for what Hal took, and more too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\ncan it come from, Davie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the Queen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davie composedly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Queen always does justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook was quite sorry to confess, for truth\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that she did\r\nnot think the Queen could have heard of the loss of the pig fund, and\r\nthat it was more likely to be from someone who wished to make up for the\r\ndisaster\xe2\x80\x94who could it be?  She looked at the round stamp upon the\r\ngreen-lettered paper, and read \xe2\x80\x9cPortsmouth.\xe2\x80\x9d  Could it be from Papa?\r\nThen she looked at the cover; but it was not a bit like the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwriting; it was pretty, lady-like, clear-looking hand-writing, and\r\npuzzled her a great deal more.  If the children had once had a secret of\r\ntheir own, there was a very considerable one to puzzle them now; and they\r\ncould hardly believe that Miss Fosbrook knew nothing about it, any more\r\nthan themselves.\r\n\r\nSo restless and puzzled were they, that she thought they would never be\r\nable to settle quietly to their lessons, and that it would save idleness\r\nif she walked with them at once to Bonchamp to get the money.  It was two\r\nmiles; but all three were stout walkers, and they were delighted to go;\r\nindeed, they would have fancied that someone else might run away with the\r\nten shillings if they had not made haste to secure it.  So \xe2\x80\x9cDavid Douglas\r\nMerrifield\xe2\x80\x9d was written, with much difficulty to make it small enough, in\r\nthe very best and roundest hand.  The boys were put into clean blouses,\r\nAnnie\xe2\x80\x99s striped cotton came to light; and off set the party through the\r\nlanes, each with sixpence in their hand, for it was poor fun to go to\r\nBonchamp, unless one had something to spend there.  David wanted a knife,\r\nJohnnie wanted a whip, Annie nothing in particular, only to go into a\r\nshop, and buy\xe2\x80\x94she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\r\n\r\nBut the wonderful affair at the post-office must have the first turn; and\r\nvery grand did David feel as the clerk peeped out from his little hole,\r\nand looked amused and gracious as the little boy stood on tiptoe to give\r\nin his green paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have it in gold or silver, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn gold, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said David.\r\n\r\nIt was something to have a bit of gold in one\xe2\x80\x99s possession for the first\r\ntime in one\xe2\x80\x99s life; and David felt as if he had grown an inch taller, and\r\nwere as good as six years old, as he walked away with the half sovereign\r\nsqueezed into his hot little palm.\r\n\r\nThe toy-shop was at the end of the street, and in they went; Johnnie to\r\ntry all the whistles in the handles of the whips, and be much disgusted\r\nthat all that had a real sound lash cost a shilling; David to open and\r\nshut the sixpenny knives with the gravity of a judge examining their\r\nblades; and Annie to gape about, and ask the price of everything, after\r\nthe tiresome fashion of people, old or young, when they come out bent on\r\nspending, but without any aim or object.  However, Annie was kind, if she\r\nwere silly, and she was very fond of Johnnie; so it ended, after a little\r\nwhispering, in her sixpence being added to his, to buy a real good whip,\r\nsuch as would crack, and not come to pieces.\r\n\r\nJust then, what should the children espy, but a nice firm deal box,\r\ncontaining a little saw, a little plane, a hammer, a gimlet, a chisel,\r\nand sundry different sizes of nails.  Was there ever anything so\r\ndelightful, especially to David, who loved nothing so well as running\r\nafter George Bowles the carpenter, and handling his tools.  What was the\r\nprice of them?\r\n\r\nJust ten shillings and sixpence.  They were very cheap, the woman of the\r\ntoy-shop said.  They had been ordered by an old lady at her grandson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentreaty; but afterwards a misgiving had seized her that the young\r\ngentleman would cut his fingers, and she would not take them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fosbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered David, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I give back the knife? then I\r\ncould buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have bought and paid for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody else will buy the box,\xe2\x80\x9d said David wistfully.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook, within herself, thought this unlikely, for nobody went to\r\nBonchamp for costly shopping; and she saw that the woman would gladly\r\nhave had the knife back, if she could have sold the tool-box, which, even\r\nat this reduced price, was much too dear for the little boys who\r\nfrequented the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away now, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said decidedly.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, another time, thank\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid was as nearly crying as ever he was, as he was forced to follow her\r\nout of the shop.  Those tools were so charming; his fingers tingled to be\r\nhammering, sawing, boring holes.  Had he lost the chance for that poor\r\nblunt knife?  Must he wait a whole fortnight for another sixpence, and\r\nfind the delicious tool-chest gone?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Davie, I am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christabel when they were in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat nasty knife!\xe2\x80\x9d cried David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the knife, Davie,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that I want to think\xe2\x80\x94I want\r\nyou to think\xe2\x80\x94why these ten shillings must have been sent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we lost the money for the pig,\xe2\x80\x9d said David.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut Kattern Hill\r\nfair is over, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a pig now; I do want the gimlet to make\r\nholes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, David; but you know what was saved for the pig came from all of\r\nyou; you would have had no right to spend it on anything else, unless\r\nthey all had consented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my very own,\xe2\x80\x9d said David; \xe2\x80\x9cit was sent to me\xe2\x80\x94myself\xe2\x80\x94me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it seems now; but just suppose you were to have a letter to say that\r\nsomeone\xe2\x80\x94poor Hal himself, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94or Papa\xe2\x80\x94had sent ten shillings to make\r\nup the money for the pig, and directed it to you because you cared so\r\nmuch, would it not be a shame to have spent the money upon yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they should not have sent it without saying,\xe2\x80\x9d said David.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook thought the same, when she saw how hard the trial was to\r\nthe little boy; but she hoped she was taking the kindest course, as she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, David, in nine days time, if you are good, you will have had\r\nanother sixpence.  I see no chance of the tools being sold; or if they\r\nare, I could send for such a box from London.  By that time, perhaps,\r\nsomething will have happened to show who sent the money, and why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it is all for myself, I may have the tools!\xe2\x80\x9d cried David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have them, if you really think it is right, when Monday week\r\ncomes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEAS were slow in both entering or dying out of David\xe2\x80\x99s mind; but while\r\nthere they reigned supreme.  Carpentry had come in as the pig had gone\r\nout, and with the more force, because a new window was being put into\r\nMamma\xe2\x80\x99s room; and George Bowles was there, with all his delightful tools,\r\nletting the little boys amuse themselves therewith, till they had hardly\r\nthree sound fingers between them; and Nurse Freeman, when she dressed\r\ntheir wounds, could not think what was the use of a lady if she could not\r\nkeep the children from hurting themselves; but Miss Fosbrook thought that\r\nit was better that boys should get a few cuts and bruises than that they\r\nshould be timid and unhandy.\r\n\r\nOne evening, all the party walked to carry to Hannah Higgins\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\ngirl a pinafore that Annie had been making.  She was a nice, tidy woman,\r\nbut there was little furniture in her house, and she looked very poor.\r\nThe garden was large, and in pretty good order; and there was an empty\r\npig-sty, into which Annie peeped significantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss Annie, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t no pig,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Higgins.  \xe2\x80\x9cBen says, says\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x98Mother, when I\xe2\x80\x99m taken on for carter boy, see if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get you a\r\nnice little pig, as will eat the garden stuff, and pay the rent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Annie, and there she came to a sudden stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he likely soon to be a carter boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Fosbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am; he is but ten years old, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t often take them on\r\nunder twelve; but he is a good boy to his mother, and a terrible one for\r\nleasing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook was obliged to have it explained to her that \xe2\x80\x9cleasing\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmeant gleaning; and she saw the grand pile of small neat bundles of wheat\r\nput out to dry on the sunny side of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Davie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Annie, as soon as they were outside the gate, \xe2\x80\x9csha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe get the pig for Hannah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my money, not yours; I shall do what I please with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDavid, rather crossly.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook pulled Annie back, and desired her to let David alone;\r\nherself wondering what would be the effect of what he had seen.\r\n\r\nHe had been eager to do good to Hannah when no desire of his own stood in\r\nthe way; but a formed wish had arisen in his mind, and he loved himself\r\nbetter than Hannah.  Christabel dreaded the clearing-up of the secret of\r\nthe post-office order, lest he should be proved to love himself more than\r\nright and justice.\r\n\r\nThere were not many letters from the absent pair of sisters; they seemed\r\nto be much too busy and happy to write, and appeared to be \xe2\x80\x9cseeing\r\neverything,\xe2\x80\x9d and to be only just able to put down the names of the\r\nwonders.  The chief of all, however, was that kind Mrs. Penrose had\r\nactually taken them to Portsmouth for a couple of nights, to see the\r\n_Ramilies_, in which she was going to remain till it sailed.  They had\r\nsat in the Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s cabin, and had slept upon \xe2\x80\x9cdear little sofas,\xe2\x80\x9d where\r\nthey wished they always slept; they had been in Papa\xe2\x80\x99s cabin, which was\r\nhalf filled up with a great gun, that can only be fired out at the window\r\n(scratched out, and \xe2\x80\x9cport-hole\xe2\x80\x9d put in.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how delightful!  I wish I had a big gun in my room!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Johnnie.\r\n\r\nAnd they had seen Sam\xe2\x80\x99s chest; and Sam did look so nice in his uniform;\r\nand he had dined with them every day.  They had dined late, with the\r\ngrown-up people; and the Admiral was so kind, only rather funny.\r\n\r\nAnnie wished she were as old as Bessie, as much as John wished to have a\r\ngun filling up his whole bed-room.\r\n\r\nThe next day, their Papa had taken them into the country to see Lady\r\nSeabury, Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s godmother, a very old lady indeed, older than\r\nGrandmamma, and who could not move out of her chair.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe gave me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwrote Bessie.  There again something had been scratched out, and \xe2\x80\x9ca kiss\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwritten overhead.\r\n\r\nThat something was quite a long word, but it had been very completely\r\nblotted out; not like the \xe2\x80\x9cwindow,\xe2\x80\x9d which had only a couple of cross\r\nbars, through which it could be plainly read; but there had plainly been\r\nfirst an attempt at smearing it out with the finger, and that not\r\nsucceeding, an immense shiny black mess, like the black shade of a chafer\r\ngrub, had been put down on it, and had come off on the opposite side of\r\nthe sheet.\r\n\r\nWhat could the word be?  Annie and David were both sure they could read\r\nthe lines through all the blot.  The first letter was certainly S.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Fosbrook, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think it is quite honourable to try to\r\nread what Bessie did not mean us to see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not quite enter into this, but they left off trying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma had been out in the carriage several times; and they were all\r\ncoming home on Saturday week\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was the best news of all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand then we\r\nhave a secret too for Miss Fosbrook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid said he was tired of secrets, and would not guess.  Annie guessed a\r\ngreat deal; but Miss Fosbrook thought more about the word she would not\r\ntry to read.  She began to have a strong suspicion from whom the\r\npost-office order had come, and was the more uneasy about the spending of\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s half sovereign; but she durst say nothing, for she knew it could\r\ndo no good if he felt himself compelled against his own will; and she saw\r\nthat he was full of thought.\r\n\r\nOne day the lawn had been mown, and the children where all very busy\r\nwheeling their little barrows, and loading them with the short grass;\r\nDavid was with them at first, but when Purday left off work, he marched\r\nafter the old man in his grave deliberate way, and was seen no more till\r\nnearly tea-time, when he walked into the school-room with a very set look\r\nupon his solemn face, and sat himself down cross-legged on the locker,\r\nwith a sigh that seemed to come out of the very depths of his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, David?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, and Miss Fosbrook let him alone; but Annie presently\r\nbounced in, crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cDavie, Davie! where were you? we have been\r\nhunting for you everywhere!  Where did you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went with Purday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, to milk the cows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went with him to Farmer Long\xe2\x80\x99s, to see his little Chinese pigs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have bought one!  O Davie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPurday is to ask the farmer about the price to-morrow morning, because\r\nhe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t get the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s tools?\xe2\x80\x9d said Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said David; \xe2\x80\x9cPurday said tools that they make for little boys never\r\nwill cut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you told Purday all about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do tell me what Purday said!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Annie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said David bluntly.  But by and by, when John came\r\nin, and a few more questions were asked, David let out that Purday had\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he thought sure enough if the money was sent to Master David\r\nfor that intent, he did not ought to spend it no other ways; and whether\r\nor not, Hannah Higgins was a deserving woman; and Master Davie didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what it was like never to have a bit of bacon ne\xe2\x80\x99er a Sunday in the\r\nwinter.  He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say but it was hard that those poor folks should get\r\nnothing but bread and cabbages from week\xe2\x80\x99s end to week\xe2\x80\x99s end, just that\r\nMaster Davie might spoil bits of deal board with making chips of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when David was sure he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil his wood, Purday had told him\r\nthat them toy-shop young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s tools were made to sell, and not\r\nmade to cut.  Best save up his money, and buy one real man\xe2\x80\x99s tool after\r\nanother; and then he\xe2\x80\x99d get a set equal to George Bowles\xe2\x80\x99s in time!\r\n\r\nThough so young, David was long-sighted and patient enough to see the\r\nsense of this, and had already made up his mind that he would begin with\r\na gimlet.  And though he did not say so, and the first resolution had\r\ncost a very tough struggle, his heart seemed to have freed itself in that\r\none great sigh, and he was at peace with himself.\r\n\r\nMiss Fosbrook was very glad he had gone to so wise and good an adviser as\r\nPurday, and was almost as happy as David himself.  She gave him and John\r\nleave to go with Purday the next day to bargain for the pig, as David was\r\nvery anxious for one in especial, whose face he said was so jolly fat;\r\nand it was grand to see the two little boys consequentially walking on\r\neither aide of Purday, who had put on his whitest round frock for the\r\ngreat occasion.\r\n\r\nFarmer Long was at home; he came out and did the honours of his ten\r\nlittle pigs; and when he found which was David\xe2\x80\x99s favourite, he declared\r\nthat it was the best of the lot, and laughed till David blushed, at the\r\nyoung gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s having got such an eye for a pig.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a regular\r\nlittle Trudgeon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Purday, (meaning perhaps a Trojan;) and it was\r\nworth at least twelve shillings, but the farmer in his good-nature\r\ndeclared that little Master should have it for the ten, as it was for a\r\npresent.  Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s boy was working for him, and was a right good lad, and\r\nhe would give him some straw for the pig\xe2\x80\x99s bed when he went home at\r\nnight.  Then he took the two boys into the parlour, and while Purday had\r\na glass of beer in the kitchen, Mrs. Long gave each of them a big slice\r\nof plum-cake, and wanted very much to have given them some wine, but that\r\nthey knew they must not have; and she inquired after their Mamma and\r\nPapa, and made them so much of visitors, that David was terribly shy, and\r\nvery glad when it was over, though John liked it, and talked fast.\r\n\r\nAs to the giving the pig, that was a serious business; and David felt hot\r\nand shy, and wanted to get it over as soon as possible without a fuss.\r\n\r\nSo he bolted into Mrs. Higgins\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, put his hands behind his back,\r\nand spoke thus:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Mrs. Higgins, put your pig-sty in order!  We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nall done it\xe2\x80\x94at least they all wanted to\xe2\x80\x94and a green order came down in a\r\nletter\xe2\x80\x94and we\xe2\x80\x99ve bought the pig, and Ben will drive it home when he comes\r\nfrom work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, as if he had been in a great fright, he ran away; while Johnnie\r\nstayed, and, when Hannah understood, received so many curtsies, and\r\nlistened to so much pleasure, that he could hardly think of anything\r\nelse, and felt very glad that _some_ pence of his had been in Toby\r\nFillpot.\r\n\r\nAnnie said that it was not fair that she had not been at the giving the\r\npig; and Miss Fosbrook was a little disappointed too; but then it was\r\nmuch better that David should not want to make a display, so she would\r\nnot complain, and comforted Annie by putting her in mind that they could\r\ngo and see the little pig in his new quarters.\r\n\r\nA few days more, and the carriage was driving up to the door with dear\r\nMamma in it, and\xe2\x80\x94why, there were three little girls, not two!  One look,\r\nand the colour came into Christabel\xe2\x80\x99s face.  It was her youngest little\r\nsister, Dora, who sat beside Bessie!  Mrs. Merrifield had gone to see\r\nMrs. Fosbrook, and ask if she could take anything for her to her\r\ndaughter; and she had been so much shocked at the sight of the little\r\npale London faces, that she had begged leave to take home one of the\r\nchildren to spend a month with her sister at Stokesley, since Miss\r\nFosbrook could not be spared to go home at present.  Was not that a\r\nsecret for Christabel?  How these two sisters did hug each other!\r\n\r\nBut the Stokesley secrets have lasted long enough; and there is no time\r\nto tell of the happy days of Dora\xe2\x80\x99s visit, and the good care that Johnnie\r\ntook of her whenever she went out, and of her pretty quiet ways that made\r\nBessie take her for her dearest of friends.  And still less can be told\r\nof the smooth, peaceful, free spirit that seemed to have come home with\r\nMamma, even though she was still able to do little among the children,\r\nfor the very having her in the house appeared to keep things from going\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nOne thing must be told, however, and that is, that when Annie told all\r\nthe wonderful story of the post-office order and the Chinese pig, Bessie\r\ngrew redder and redder in the face, and Susan squeezed both her hands\r\ntight together, and said \xe2\x80\x9cMay I tell, Bessie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STOKESLEY SECRET***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 3411-0.txt or 3411-0.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/3/4/1/3411\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org \r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
