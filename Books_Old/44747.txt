DUTTON AND CO.\r\n\r\n1916\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nSome slight sketch of the life and character of Stendhal is\r\nparticularly necessary to an understanding of _Le Rouge et Le Noir_\r\n(_The Red and the Black_) not so much as being the formal stuffing of\r\nwhich introductions are made, but because the book as a book stands\r\nin the most intimate relation to the author\'s life and character. The\r\nhero, Julien, is no doubt, viewed superficially, a cad, a scoundrel,\r\nan assassin, albeit a person who will alternate the moist eye of the\r\nsentimentalist with the ferocious grin of the beast of prey. But\r\nStendhal so far from putting forward any excuses makes a specific point\r\nof wallowing defiantly in his own alleged wickedness. "Even assuming\r\nthat Julien is a villain and that it is my portrait," he wrote shortly\r\nafter the publication of the book, "why quarrel with me. In the time of\r\nthe Emperor, Julien would have passed for a very honest man. I lived in\r\nthe time of the Emperor. So--but what does it matter?"\r\n\r\nHenri Beyle was born in 1783 in Grenoble in Dauphiny, the son of a\r\nroyalist lawyer, situated on the borderland between the gentry and\r\nthat bourgeoisie which our author was subsequently to chastise with\r\nthat malice peculiar to those who spring themselves from the class\r\nwhich they despise. The boy\'s character was a compound of sensibility\r\nand hard rebelliousness, virility and introspection. Orphaned of his\r\nmother at the age of seven, hated by his father and unpopular with his\r\nschoolmates, he spent the orthodox unhappy childhood of the artistic\r\ntemperament. Winning a scholarship at the Ecole Polytechnique at\r\nthe age of sixteen he proceeded to Paris, where with characteristic\r\nindependence he refused to attend the college classes and set himself\r\nto study privately in his solitary rooms.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 the influence of his relative M. Daru procured him a commission\r\nin the French Army, and the Marengo campaign gave him an opportunity\r\nof practising that Napoleonic worship to which throughout his life he\r\nremained consistently faithful, for the operation of the philosophical\r\nmaterialism of the French sceptics on an essentially logical and\r\nmathematical mind soon swept away all competing claimants for his\r\nreligious adoration. Almost from his childhood, moreover, he had\r\nabominated the Jesuits, and "Papism is the source of all crimes," was\r\nthroughout his life one of his favourite maxims.\r\n\r\nAfter the army\'s triumphant entry into Milan, Beyle returned to\r\nGrenoble on furlough, whence he dashed off to Paris in pursuit of\r\na young woman to whom he was paying some attention, resigned his\r\ncommission in the army and set himself to study "with the view of\r\nbecoming a great man." It is in this period that we find the most\r\nmarked development in Beyle\'s enthusiasm of psychology. This tendency\r\nsprang primarily no doubt from his own introspection. For throughout\r\nhis life Beyle enjoyed the indisputable and at times dubious luxury\r\nof a double consciousness. He invariably carried inside his brain\r\na psychological mirror which reflected every phrase of his emotion\r\nwith scientific accuracy. And simultaneously, the critical spirit,\r\nhalf-genie, half-demon inside his brain, would survey in the\r\nsemi-detached mood of a keenly interested spectator, the actual emotion\r\nitself, applaud or condemn it as the case might be, and ticket the\r\nverdict with ample commentations in the psychological register of its\r\nown analysis.\r\n\r\nBut this trend to psychology, while as we have seen, to some extent,\r\nthe natural development of mere self-analysis was also tinged with the\r\nspirit of self-preservation. With a mind, which in spite of its natural\r\nphysical courage was morbidly susceptible to ridicule and was only too\r\nfrequently the dupe of the fear of being duped, Stendhal would scent\r\nan enemy in every friend, and as a mere matter of self-protection set\r\nhimself to penetrate the secret of every character with which he came\r\ninto contact. One is also justified in taking into account an honest\r\nintellectual enthusiasm which found its vent in deciphering the rarer\r\nand more precious manuscripts of the "human document."\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a stay in Marseilles, with his first mistress\r\nM\xc3\xa9lanie Guilhert ("a charming actress who had the most refined\r\nsentiments and to whom I never gave a sou,") and a subsequent sojourn\r\nin Grenoble, Stendhal remained in Paris till 1806, living so far as was\r\npermitted by the modest allowance of his niggard father the full life\r\nof the literary temperament. The essence, however, of his character was\r\nthat he was at the same time a man of imagination and a man of action.\r\nWe consequently find him serving in the Napoleonic campaigns of 1806,\r\n1809 and 1812. He was present at the Battle of Jena, came several\r\ntimes into personal contact with Napoleon, discharged with singular\r\nefficiency the administration of the State of Brunswick, and retained\r\nhis sangfroid and his bravery during the whole of the panic-stricken\r\nretreat of the Moscow campaign.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, to this period that we date Stendhal\'s liaison with\r\nMme. Daru the wife of his aged relative, M. Daru. This particular\r\nintrigue has, moreover, a certain psychological importance in that\r\nMme. Daru constituted the model on whom Mathilde de la Mole was drawn\r\nin _The Red and the Black_. The student and historian consequently who\r\nis anxious to check how far the novelist is drawing on his experience\r\nand how far on his imagination can compare with profit the description\r\nof the Mathilde episode in _The Red and the Black_ with those sections\r\nin Stendhal\'s Journal entitled the _Life and Sentiments of Silencious\r\nHarry_, _Memoirs of my Life during my Amour with Countess Palfy_,\r\nand also with the posthumous fragment, _Le Consultation de Banti_, a\r\npiece of methodical deliberation on the pressing question. "Dois-je ou\r\nne dois-je pas avoir la duchesse?" written with all the documentary\r\ncoldness of a Government report. It is characteristic that both Bansi\r\nand Julien decide in the affirmative as a matter of abstract principle.\r\nFor they both feel that they must necessarily reproach themselves in\r\nafter life if they miss so signal an opportunity.\r\n\r\nDisgusted by the Restoration, Stendhal migrated in 1814 to Milan, his\r\nfavourite town in Europe, whose rich and varied life he savoured to\r\nthe full from the celebrated ices in the entreates of the opera, to\r\nthe reciprocated interest of Mme. Angelina Pietragrua (the Duchesse\r\nde Sansererina of the Chartreuse of Parma), "a sublime wanton \xc3\xa0 la\r\nLucrezia Borgia" who would appear to have deceived him systematically.\r\nIt was in Milan that Stendhal first began to write for publication,\r\nproducing in 1814 _The Lives of Haydn and Mozart_, and in 1817 a series\r\nof travel sketches, _Rome, Naples, Florence_, which was published in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIt was in Milan also than Stendhal first nursed the abstract thrills\r\nof his grand passion for M\xc3\xa9tilde Countess Dunbowska, whose angelic\r\nsweetness would seem to have served at any rate to some extent as a\r\nprototype to the character of Mme. de R\xc3\xaanal. In 1821 the novelist was\r\nexpelled from Milan on the apparently unfounded accusation of being\r\na French spy. It is typical of that mixture of brutal sensuality and\r\nrarefied sentimentalism which is one of the most fascinating features\r\nof Stendhal\'s character, that even though he had never loved more than\r\nthe lady\'s heart, he should have remained for three years faithful to\r\nthis mistress of his ideal.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 Stendhal published his treatise, _De l\'Amour_, a practical\r\nscientific treatise on the erotic emotion by an author who possessed\r\nthe unusual advantage of being at the same time an acute psychologist\r\nand a brilliant man of the world, who could test abstract theories by\r\nconcrete practice and could co-ordinate what he had felt in himself and\r\nobserve in others into broad general principles.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Stendhal plunging vigorously into the controversy between the\r\nClassicists and the Romanticists, published his celebrated pamphlet,\r\n_Racine and Shakespeare_, in which he vindicated with successful\r\ncrispness the claims of live verse against stereotyped couplets and\r\nof modern analysis against historical tradition. His next work was\r\nthe _Life of Rossini_, whom he had known personally in Milan, while\r\nin 1827 he published his first novel _Armance_, which, while not\r\nequal to the author\'s greatest work, give none the less good promise\r\nof that analytical dash which he was subsequently to manifest. After\r\n_Armance_ come the well-known _Promenades Rome_, while the Stendhalian\r\nmasterpiece _Le Rouge et Le Noir_ was presented in 1830 to an\r\nunappreciative public.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm for this book is the infallible test of your true\r\nStendhalian. Some critics may prefer, possibly, the more Jamesian\r\ndelicacy of _Armance_, and others fortified by the example of Goethe\r\nmay avow their predilection for _The Chartreuse de Parme_ with all the\r\n_jeune premier_ charm of its amiable hero. But in our view no book by\r\nStendhal is capable of giving the reader such intellectual thrills as\r\nthat work which has been adjudged to be his greatest by Balzac, by\r\nTaine, by Bourget. Certainly no other book by Stendhal than that which\r\nhas conjured up _Rougistes_ in all countries in Europe has been the\r\nobject of a cult in itself. We doubt, moreover, if there is any other\r\nmodern book whether by Stendhal or any one else, which has actually\r\nbeen learnt by heart by its devotees, who, if we may borrow the story\r\ntold by M. Paul Bourget, are accustomed to challenge the authenticity\r\nof each other\'s knowledge by starting off with some random passage only\r\nto find it immediately taken up, as though the book had been the very\r\nBible itself.\r\n\r\nThe more personal appeal of what is perhaps the greatest romance\r\nof the intellect ever written lies in the character of Julien, its\r\nvillain-hero. In view of the identification of Julien with Stendhal\r\nhimself to which we have already alluded, it is only fair to state\r\nthat Stendhal does not appear to have ever been a tutor in a bourgeois\r\nfamily, nor does history relate his ever having made any attempt at the\r\nhomicide of a woman. So far, in fact, as what we may call the external\r\nphysical basis of the story is concerned, the material is supplied\r\nnot by the life of the author, but by the life of a young student of\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on, of the name of Berthet, who duly expiated on the threshold\r\nthat crime which supplied the plot of this immortal novel. But the\r\nsoul, the brain of Julien is not Berthet but Beyle. And what indeed is\r\nthe whole book if not a vindication of _beylisme_, if we may use the\r\nword, coined by the man himself for his own outlook on life? For the\r\nprocedure of Stendhal would seem to have placed his own self in his\r\nhero\'s shoes, to have lived in imagination his whole life, and to have\r\nrecorded his experience with a wealth of analytic detail, which in\r\nspite of some arrogance, is yet both honest and scientific.\r\n\r\nAnd the life of this scoundrel, this ingrate, this assassin, certainly\r\nseems to have been eminently worth living. In its line, indeed, it\r\nconstitutes a veritable triumph of idealism, a positive monument of\r\n"self-help." For judged by the code of the Revolution, when the career\r\nwas open to talents, the goodness or badness of a man was determined by\r\nthe use he made of his opportunities. Efficiency was the supreme test\r\nof virtue, as was failure the one brand of unworthiness. And measured\r\nby these values Julien ranks high as an ethical saint. For does he\r\nnot sacrifice everything to the forgiving of his character and the\r\nhammering out of his career? He is by nature nervous, he forces himself\r\nto be courageous, fighting a duel or capturing a woman, less out of\r\nthirst for blood or hunger for flesh, than because he thinks it due\r\nto his own _parvenu_ self-respect to give himself some concrete proof\r\non his own moral force. "Pose and affection" will sneer those enemies\r\nwhom he will have to-day as assuredly as he had them in his lifetime,\r\nthe smug bourgeois and Valenods of our present age. But the spirit\r\nof Julien will retort, "I made myself master of my affectation and I\r\nsucceeded in my pose." And will he not have logic on his side? For what\r\nafter all is pose but the pursuit of a subjective ideal, grotesque no\r\ndoubt in failure, but dignified by its success. And as M. Gaultier has\r\nshown in his book on _Bovarysme_, is not all human progress simply the\r\ndeliberate change from what one is, into what one is not yet, but what\r\nnevertheless one has a tendency to be? Viewed from this standpoint\r\nJulien\'s character is what one feels justified in calling a _bon\xc3\xa2 fide_\r\npose. For speaking broadly his character is two-fold, half-sensitive\r\ntenderness, half ferocious ambition, and his pose simply consists\r\nin the subordination of his softer qualities for the more effective\r\nrealization of his harder. Considered on these lines _Le Rouge et Le\r\nNoir_ stands pre-eminent in European literature as the tragedy of\r\nenergy and ambition, the epic of the struggle for existence, the modern\r\nBible of Nietzschean self-discipline. And from the sheer romantic\r\naspect also the book has its own peculiar charm. How truly poetic, for\r\ninstance, are the passages where Julien takes his own mind alone into\r\nthe mountains, plots out his own fate, and symbolizes his own solitary\r\nlife in the lonely circlings of a predatory hawk.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s enemies will no doubt taunt him with his introspection, while\r\nthey point to a character distorted, so they say, by the eternal mirror\r\nof its own consciousness. Yet it should be remembered that Julien lived\r\nin an age when introspection had, so to speak, been only recently\r\ninvented, and Byronism and Wertherism were the stock food of artistic\r\ntemperaments. In the case of Julien, moreover, even though his own\r\ncriticisms on his own acts were to some extent as important to him as\r\nthe actual acts themselves, his introspection was more a strength than\r\na weakness and never blunted the edge of his drastic action. Compare,\r\nfor instance, the character of Julien with the character of Robert\r\nGreslou, the hero of Bourget\'s _Le Disciple_, and the nearest analogue\r\nto Julien in _fin de si\xc3\xa8cle_ literature, and one will appreciate at\r\nonce the difference between health and decadence, virility and hysteria.\r\n\r\nOne of the most essential features of the book, however, is the swing\r\nof the pendulum between Julien\'s ambition and Julien\'s tenderness. For\r\nour hunter is quite frequently caught in his own traps, so that he\r\nfalls genuinely in love with the woman whom, as a matter of abstract\r\nprinciple, he had specifically set himself to conquer. The book\r\nconsequently as a romance of love, ranks almost as high as it does as a\r\nromance of ambition. The final idyll in prison with Mme. de R\xc3\xaanal, in\r\nparticular, is one of the sweetest and purest in literature, painted\r\nin colours too true ever to be florid, steeped in a sentiment too deep\r\never to be mawkish. As moreover, orthodox and suburban minds tend to\r\nregard all French novels as specifically devoted to obscene wallowings,\r\nit seems only relevant to mention that Stendhal at any rate never finds\r\nin sensualism any inspiration for ecstatic rhapsodies, and that he\r\nnarrates the most specific episodes in the chastest style imaginable.\r\n\r\nThough too the sinister figure of the carpenter\'s son looms large\r\nover the book, the characterization of all the other personages is\r\nportrayed with consummate brilliancy. For Stendhal standing first\r\noutside his characters with all the sceptical scrutiny of a detached\r\nobserver, then goes deep inside them so that he describes not merely\r\nwhat they do, but why they do it, not merely what they think, but\r\nwhy they think it, while he assigns their respective share to innate\r\ndisposition, accident, and environment, and criticizes his creations\r\nwith an irony that is only occasionally benevolent. For it must be\r\nconfessed that Stendhal approves of extremely few people. True scion\r\nof the middle-classes he hates the bourgeois because he is bourgeois,\r\nand the aristocrat because he is aristocrat. Nevertheless, as a gallery\r\nof the most varied characters, patricians and plebeians, prudes and\r\nprofligates, Jesuits and Jansenists, Kings and coachmen, bishops and\r\nbourgeois, whose mutual difference acts as a most effective foil to\r\neach other\'s reality, _Le Rouge et Le Noir_ will beat any novel outside\r\nBalzac.\r\n\r\nWe would mention in particular those two contrasted figures, Mme. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal the _bourgeoise passion\xc3\xa9e_, and Matilde de la Mole the noble\r\ndamozel who enters into her intrigue out of a deliberate wish to\r\nemulate the exploits of a romantic ancestress. But after all these\r\nindividuals stand out not so much because their characterization is\r\nbetter than that of their fellow-personages, but because it is more\r\nelaborate. Even such minor characters, for instance, as de Frilair, the\r\nlascivious Jesuit, Noiraud, the avaricious gaoler, Mme. de Fervaques,\r\nthe amoristic prude, are all in their respective ways real, vivid,\r\nconvincing, no mere padded figures of the imagination, but observed\r\nactualities swung from the lived life on the written page.\r\n\r\nThe style of Stendhal is noticeable from its simplicity, clear and\r\ncold, devoid of all literary artifice, characteristic of his analytic\r\npurpose. He is strenuous in his avoidance of affection. Though,\r\nhowever, he never holds out his style as an aesthetic delight in\r\nitself, he reaches occasionally passages of a rare and simple beauty.\r\nWe would refer in particular to the description of Julien in the\r\nmountains, which we have already mentioned, and to the short but\r\nimpressive death scene. His habit, however, of using language as a\r\nmeans and never as an end, occasionally revenges itself upon him in\r\nplaces where the style, though intelligible, is none the less slovenly,\r\nanacoluthic, almost Thucydidean.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of _Le Rouge et Le Noir_ Stendhal was forced\r\nby his financial embarrassment to leave Paris and take up the post\r\nof consul at Trieste. Driven from this position by the intrigues of\r\na vindictive Church he was transferred to Civita Vecchia where he\r\nremained till 1835, solacing his ennui by the compilation of his\r\nautobiography and thinking seriously of marriage with the rich and\r\nhighly respectable daughter of his laundress. He then returned to Paris\r\nwhere he remained till 1842, where he died suddenly at the age of\r\nfifty-nine in the full swing of all his mental and physical activities.\r\n\r\nHis later works included, _La Chartreuse de Parme_, _Lucien, Leuwen_\r\nand _Lamiel_, of which the _Chartreuse_ is the most celebrated, but\r\n_Lamiel_ certainly the most sprightly. But it is on _Le Rouge et Le\r\nNoir_ that his fame as a novelist is the most firmly based. It is\r\nwith this most personal document, this record of his experiences\r\nand emotions that he lives identified, just as D\'Annunzio will live\r\nidentified with _Il Fuoco_ or Mr. Wells with the _New Machiavelli_.\r\n_Le Rouge et Le Noir_ is the greatest novel of its age and one of the\r\ngreatest novels of the whole nineteenth century. It is full to the brim\r\nof intellect and adventure, introspection and action, youth, romance,\r\ntenderness, cynicism and rebellion. It is in a word the intellectual\r\nquintessence of the Napoleonic era.\r\n\r\nHORACE B. SAMUEL, TEMPLE, Oct., 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED AND THE BLACK\r\n\r\nA CHRONICLE OF 1830\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nA SMALL TOWN\r\n\r\n\r\n    Put thousands together less bad,\r\n    But the cage less gay.--_Hobbes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little town of Verri\xc3\xa8res can pass for one of the prettiest in\r\nFranche-Comt\xc3\xa9. Its white houses with their pointed red-tiled roofs\r\nstretch along the slope of a hill, whose slightest undulations are\r\nmarked by groups of vigorous chestnuts. The Doubs flows to within some\r\nhundred feet above its fortifications, which were built long ago by the\r\nSpaniards, and are now in ruins.\r\n\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res is sheltered on the north by a high mountain which is one of\r\nthe branches of the Jura. The jagged peaks of the Verra are covered\r\nwith snow from the beginning of the October frosts. A torrent which\r\nrushes down from the mountains traverses Verri\xc3\xa8res before throwing\r\nitself into the Doubs, and supplies the motive power for a great number\r\nof saw mills. The industry is very simple, and secures a certain\r\nprosperity to the majority of the inhabitants who are more peasant than\r\nbourgeois. It is not, however, the wood saws which have enriched this\r\nlittle town. It is the manufacture of painted tiles, called Mulhouse\r\ntiles, that is responsible for that general affluence which has caused\r\nthe fa\xc3\xa7ades of nearly all the houses in Verri\xc3\xa8res to be rebuilt since\r\nthe fall of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nOne has scarcely entered the town, before one is stunned by the din of\r\na strident machine of terrifying aspect. Twenty heavy hammers which\r\nfall with a noise that makes the paved floor tremble, are lifted\r\nup by a wheel set in motion by the torrent. Each of these hammers\r\nmanufactures every day I don\'t know how many thousands of nails. The\r\nlittle pieces of iron which are rapidly transformed into nails by these\r\nenormous hammers, are put in position by fresh pretty young girls. This\r\nlabour so rough at first sight is one of the industries which most\r\nsurprises the traveller who penetrates for the first time the mountains\r\nwhich separate France and Helvetia. If when he enters Verri\xc3\xa8res, the\r\ntraveller asks who owns this fine nail factory which deafens everybody\r\nwho goes up the Grande-Rue, he is answered in a drawling tone "Eh!\r\nit belongs to M. the Mayor."\r\n\r\nAnd if the traveller stops a few minutes in that Grande-Rue of\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res which goes on an upward incline from the bank of the Doubs to\r\nnearly as far as the summit of the hill, it is a hundred to one that he\r\nwill see a big man with a busy and important air.\r\n\r\nWhen he comes in sight all hats are quickly taken off. His hair is\r\ngrizzled and he is dressed in grey. He is a Knight of several Orders,\r\nhas a large forehead and an aquiline nose, and if you take him all\r\nround, his features are not devoid of certain regularity. One might\r\neven think on the first inspection that it combines with the dignity\r\nof the village mayor that particular kind of comfortableness which is\r\nappropriate to the age of forty-eight or fifty. But soon the traveller\r\nfrom Paris will be shocked by a certain air of self-satisfaction and\r\nself-complacency mingled with an almost indefinable narrowness and lack\r\nof inspiration. One realises at last that this man\'s talent is limited\r\nto seeing that he is paid exactly what he is owed, and in paying his\r\nown debts at the latest possible moment.\r\n\r\nSuch is M. de R\xc3\xaanal, the mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res. After having crossed the\r\nroad with a solemn step, he enters the mayoral residence and disappears\r\nfrom the eye of the traveller. But if the latter continues to walk\r\na hundred steps further up, he will perceive a house with a fairly\r\nfine appearance, with some magnificent gardens behind an iron grill\r\nbelonging to the house. Beyond that is an horizon line formed by the\r\nhills of Burgundy, which seem ideally made to delight the eyes. This\r\nview causes the traveller to forget that pestilential atmosphere of\r\npetty money-grubbing by which he is beginning to be suffocated.\r\n\r\nHe is told that this house belongs to M. de R\xc3\xaanal. It is to the\r\nprofits which he has made out of his big nail factory that the mayor\r\nof Verri\xc3\xa8res owes this fine residence of hewn stone which he is just\r\nfinishing. His family is said to be Spanish and ancient, and is alleged\r\nto have been established in the country well before the conquest of\r\nLouis XIV.\r\n\r\nSince 1815, he blushes at being a manufacturer: 1815 made him mayor\r\nof Verri\xc3\xa8res. The terraced walls of this magnificent garden which\r\ndescends to the Doubs, plateau by plateau, also represent the reward\r\nof M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s proficiency in the iron-trade. Do not expect to find\r\nin France those picturesque gardens which surround the manufacturing\r\ntowns of Germany, like Leipsic, Frankfurt and Nurenburgh, etc. The\r\nmore walls you build in Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9 and the more you fortify your\r\nestate with piles of stone, the more claim you will acquire on the\r\nrespect of your neighbours. Another reason for the admiration due to\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s gardens and their numerous walls, is the fact that he\r\nhas purchased, through sheer power of the purse, certain small parcels\r\nof the ground on which they stand. That saw-mill, for instance, whose\r\nsingular position on the banks of the Doubs struck you when you entered\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res, and where you notice the name of SOREL written in gigantic\r\ncharacters on the chief beam of the roof, used to occupy six years\r\nago that precise space on which is now reared the wall of the fourth\r\nterrace in M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s gardens.\r\n\r\nProud man that he was, the mayor had none the less to negotiate with\r\nthat tough, stubborn peasant, old Sorel. He had to pay him in good\r\nsolid golden louis before he could induce him to transfer his workshop\r\nelsewhere. As to the _public_ stream which supplied the motive power\r\nfor the saw-mill, M. de R\xc3\xaanal obtained its diversion, thanks to the\r\ninfluence which he enjoyed at Paris. This favour was accorded him after\r\nthe election of 182-.\r\n\r\nHe gave Sorel four acres for every one he had previously held, five\r\nhundred yards lower down on the banks of the Doubs. Although this\r\nposition was much more advantageous for his pine-plank trade, father\r\nSorel (as he is called since he has become rich) knew how to exploit\r\nthe impatience and _mania for landed ownership_ which animated his\r\nneighbour to the tune of six thousand francs.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this arrangement was criticised by the wiseacres of the\r\nlocality. One day, it was on a Sunday four years later, as M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nwas coming back from church in his mayor\'s uniform, he saw old Sorel\r\nsmiling at him, as he stared at him some distance away surrounded by\r\nhis three sons. That smile threw a fatal flood of light into the soul\r\nof the mayor. From that time on, he is of opinion that he could have\r\nobtained the exchange at a cheaper rate.\r\n\r\nIn order to win the public esteem of Verri\xc3\xa8res it is essential that,\r\nthough you should build as many walls as you can, you should not adopt\r\nsome plan imported from Italy by those masons who cross the passes\r\nof the Jura in the spring on their way to Paris. Such an innovation\r\nwould bring down upon the head of the imprudent builder an eternal\r\nreputation for _wrongheadedness_, and he will be lost for ever in the\r\nsight of those wise, well-balanced people who dispense public esteem in\r\nFranche-Comt\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, these prudent people exercise in the place the\r\nmost offensive despotism. It is by reason of this awful word, that\r\nanyone who has lived in that great republic which is called Paris,\r\nfinds living in little towns quite intolerable. The tyranny of public\r\nopinion (and what public opinion!) is as _stupid_ in the little towns\r\nof France as in the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA MAYOR\r\n\r\n\r\n        Importance! What is it, sir after all? The respect of\r\n        fools, the wonder of children, the envy of the rich, the\r\n        contempt of the wise man.--_Barnave_\r\n\r\n\r\nHappily for the reputation of M. de R\xc3\xaanal as an administrator an\r\nimmense wall of support was necessary for the public promenade which\r\ngoes along the hill, a hundred steps above the course of the Doubs.\r\nThis admirable position secures for the promenade one of the most\r\npicturesque views in the whole of France. But the rain water used to\r\nmake furrows in the walk every spring, caused ditches to appear, and\r\nrendered it generally impracticable. This nuisance, which was felt\r\nby the whole town, put M. de R\xc3\xaanal in the happy position of being\r\ncompelled to immortalise his administration by building a wall twenty\r\nfeet high and thirty to forty yards long.\r\n\r\nThe parapet of this wall, which occasioned M. de R\xc3\xaanal three journeys\r\nto Paris (for the last Minister of the Interior but one had declared\r\nhimself the mortal enemy of the promenade of Verri\xc3\xa8res), is now raised\r\nto a height of four feet above the ground, and as though to defy all\r\nministers whether past or present, it is at present adorned with tiles\r\nof hewn stone.\r\n\r\nHow many times have my looks plunged into the valley of the Doubs, as I\r\nthought of the Paris balls which I had abandoned on the previous night,\r\nand leant my breast against the great blocks of stone, whose beautiful\r\ngrey almost verged on blue. Beyond the left bank, there wind five\r\nor six valleys, at the bottom of which I could see quite distinctly\r\nseveral small streams. There is a view of them falling into the Doubs,\r\nafter a series of cascades. The sun is very warm in these mountains.\r\nWhen it beats straight down, the pensive traveller on the terrace\r\nfinds shelter under some magnificent plane trees. They owe their rapid\r\ngrowth and their fine verdure with its almost bluish shade to the new\r\nsoil, which M. the mayor has had placed behind his immense wall of\r\nsupport for (in spite of the opposition of the Municipal Council) he\r\nhas enlarged the promenade by more than six feet (and although he is an\r\nUltra and I am a Liberal, I praise him for it), and that is why both in\r\nhis opinion and in that of M. Valenod, the fortunate Director of the\r\nworkhouse of Verri\xc3\xa8res, this terrace can brook comparison with that of\r\nSaint-Germain en Laye.\r\n\r\nI find personally only one thing at which to cavil in the COURS DE LA\r\nFIDELITE, (this official name is to be read in fifteen to twenty places\r\non those immortal tiles which earned M. de R\xc3\xaanal an extra cross.) The\r\ngrievance I find in the Cours de la Fid\xc3\xa9lit\xc3\xa9 is the barbarous manner in\r\nwhich the authorities have cut these vigorous plane trees and clipped\r\nthem to the quick. In fact they really resemble with their dwarfed,\r\nrounded and flattened heads the most vulgar plants of the vegetable\r\ngarden, while they are really capable of attaining the magnificent\r\ndevelopment of the English plane trees. But the wish of M. the mayor\r\nis despotic, and all the trees belonging to the municipality are\r\nruthlessly pruned twice a year. The local Liberals suggest, but they\r\nare probably exaggerating, that the hand of the official gardener\r\nhas become much more severe, since M. the Vicar Maslon started\r\nappropriating the clippings. This young ecclesiastic was sent to\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on some years ago to keep watch on the abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan and some cures\r\nin the neighbouring districts. An old Surgeon-Major of Napoleon\'s\r\nItalian Army, who was living in retirement at Verri\xc3\xa8res, and who had\r\nbeen in his time described by M. the mayor as both a Jacobin and a\r\nBonapartiste, dared to complain to the mayor one day of the periodical\r\nmutilation of these fine trees.\r\n\r\n"I like the shade," answered M. de R\xc3\xaanal, with just a tinge of that\r\nhauteur which becomes a mayor when he is talking to a surgeon, who is\r\na member of the Legion of Honour. "I like the shade, I have _my_ trees\r\nclipped in order to give shade, and I cannot conceive that a tree can\r\nhave any other purpose, provided of course _it is not bringing in any\r\nprofit_, like the useful walnut tree."\r\n\r\nThis is the great word which is all decisive at Verri\xc3\xa8res. "BRINGING IN\r\nPROFIT," this word alone sums up the habitual trend of thought of more\r\nthan three-quarters of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n_Bringing in profit_ is the consideration which decides everything in\r\nthis little town which you thought so pretty. The stranger who arrives\r\nin the town is fascinated by the beauty of the fresh deep valleys which\r\nsurround it, and he imagines at first that the inhabitants have an\r\nappreciation of the beautiful. They talk only too frequently of the\r\nbeauty of their country, and it cannot be denied that they lay great\r\nstress on it, but the reason is that it attracts a number of strangers,\r\nwhose money enriches the inn-keepers, a process which _brings in\r\nprofit_ to the town, owing to the machinery of the octroi.\r\n\r\nIt was on a fine, autumn day that M. de R\xc3\xaanal was taking a promenade\r\non the Cours de la Fid\xc3\xa9lit\xc3\xa9 with his wife on his arm. While listening\r\nto her husband (who was talking in a somewhat solemn manner) Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal followed anxiously with her eyes the movements of three little\r\nboys. The eldest, who might have been eleven years old, went too\r\nfrequently near the parapet and looked as though he was going to climb\r\nup it. A sweet voice then pronounced the name of Adolphe and the child\r\ngave up his ambitious project. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal seemed a woman of thirty\r\nyears of age but still fairly pretty.\r\n\r\n"He may be sorry for it, may this fine gentleman from Paris," said\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal, with an offended air and a face even paler than usual.\r\n"I am not without a few friends at court!" But though I want to\r\ntalk to you about the provinces for two hundred pages, I lack the\r\nrequisite barbarity to make you undergo all the long-windedness and\r\ncircumlocutions of a provincial dialogue.\r\n\r\nThis fine gentleman from Paris, who was so odious to the mayor of\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res, was no other than the M. Appert, who had two days previously\r\nmanaged to find his way not only into the prison and workhouse of\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res, but also into the hospital, which was gratuitously conducted\r\nby the mayor and the principal proprietors of the district.\r\n\r\n"But," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal timidly, "what harm can this Paris\r\ngentleman do you, since you administer the poor fund with the utmost\r\nscrupulous honesty?"\r\n\r\n"He only comes to _throw_ blame and afterwards he will get some\r\narticles into the Liberal press."\r\n\r\n"You never read them, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But they always talk to us about those Jacobin articles, all that\r\ndistracts us and prevents us from doing good.[1] Personally, I shall\r\nnever forgive the cur\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\n[1] Historically true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE POOR FUND\r\n\r\n\r\n        A virtuous cur\xc3\xa9 who does not intrigue is a providence\r\n        for the village.--_Fleury_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that the cur\xc3\xa9 of Verri\xc3\xa8res, an old man of\r\nninety, who owed to the bracing mountain air an iron constitution and\r\nan iron character, had the right to visit the prison, the hospital and\r\nthe workhouse at any hour. It had been at precisely six o\'clock in the\r\nmorning that M. Appert, who had a Paris recommendation to the cur\xc3\xa9,\r\nhad been shrewd enough to arrive at a little inquisitive town. He had\r\nimmediately gone on to the cur\xc3\xa9\'s house.\r\n\r\nThe cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan became pensive as he read the letter written to him by\r\nthe M. le Marquis de La Mole, Peer of France, and the richest landed\r\nproprietor of the province.\r\n\r\n"I am old and beloved here," he said to himself in a whisper, "they\r\nwould not dare!" Then he suddenly turned to the gentleman from Paris,\r\nwith eyes, which in spite of his great age, shone with that sacred fire\r\nwhich betokens the delight of doing a fine but slightly dangerous act.\r\n\r\n"Come with me, sir," he said, "but please do not express any opinion of\r\nthe things which we shall see, in the presence of the jailer, and above\r\nall not in the presence of the superintendents of the workhouse."\r\n\r\nM. Appert realised that he had to do with a man of spirit. He followed\r\nthe venerable cur\xc3\xa9, visited the hospital and workhouse, put a lot of\r\nquestions, but in spite of somewhat extraordinary answers, did not\r\nindulge in the slightest expression of censure.\r\n\r\nThis visit lasted several hours; the cur\xc3\xa9 invited M. Appert to dine,\r\nbut the latter made the excuse of having some letters to write; as a\r\nmatter of fact, he did not wish to compromise his generous companion to\r\nany further extent. About three o\'clock these gentlemen went to finish\r\ntheir inspection of the workhouse and then returned to the prison.\r\nThere they found the jailer by the gate, a kind of giant, six feet\r\nhigh, with bow legs. His ignoble face had become hideous by reason of\r\nhis terror.\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur," he said to the cur\xc3\xa9 as soon as he saw him, "is not the\r\ngentleman whom I see there, M. Appert?"\r\n\r\n"What does that matter?" said the cur\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n"The reason is that I received yesterday the most specific orders, and\r\nM. the Prefect sent a message by a gendarme who must have galloped\r\nduring the whole of the night, that M. Appert was not to be allowed in\r\nthe prisons."\r\n\r\n"I can tell you, M. Noiroud," said the cur\xc3\xa9, "that the traveller who is\r\nwith me is M. Appert, but do you or do you not admit that I have the\r\nright to enter the prison at any hour of the day or night accompanied\r\nby anybody I choose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, M. the cur\xc3\xa9," said the jailer in a low voice, lowering his head\r\nlike a bull-dog, induced to a grudging obedience by fear of the stick,\r\n"only, M. the cur\xc3\xa9, I have a wife and children, and shall be turned out\r\nif they inform against me. I only have my place to live on."\r\n\r\n"I, too, should be sorry enough to lose mine," answered the good cur\xc3\xa9,\r\nwith increasing emotion in his voice.\r\n\r\n"What a difference!" answered the jailer keenly. "As for you, M. le\r\ncur\xc3\xa9, we all know that you have eight hundred francs a year, good solid\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\nSuch were the facts which, commented upon and exaggerated in twenty\r\ndifferent ways, had been agitating for the last two days all the odious\r\npassions of the little town of Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\nAt the present time they served as the text for the little discussion\r\nwhich M. de R\xc3\xaanal was having with his wife. He had visited the cur\xc3\xa9\r\nearlier in the morning accompanied by M. Valenod, the director of the\r\nworkhouse, in order to convey their most emphatic displeasure. M.\r\nCh\xc3\xa9lan had no protector, and felt all the weight of their words.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen, I shall be the third cur\xc3\xa9 of eighty years of age who\r\nhas been turned out in this district. I have been here for fifty-six\r\nyears. I have baptized nearly all the inhabitants of the town, which\r\nwas only a hamlet when I came to it. Every day I marry young people\r\nwhose grandparents I have married in days gone by. Verri\xc3\xa8res is my\r\nfamily, but I said to myself when I saw the stranger, \'This man from\r\nParis may as a matter of fact be a Liberal, there are only too many of\r\nthem about, but what harm can he do to our poor and to our prisoners?\'"\r\n\r\nThe reproaches of M. de R\xc3\xaanal, and above all, those of M. Valenod, the\r\ndirector of the workhouse, became more and more animated.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen, turn me out then," the old cur\xc3\xa9 exclaimed in a\r\ntrembling voice; "I shall still continue to live in the district. As\r\nyou know, I inherited forty-eight years ago a piece of land that brings\r\nin eight hundred francs a year; I shall live on that income. I do not\r\nsave anything out of my living, gentlemen; and that is perhaps why,\r\nwhen you talk to me about it, I am not particularly frightened."\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal always got on very well with his wife, but he did not know\r\nwhat to answer when she timidly repeated the phrase of M. le cur\xc3\xa9,\r\n"What harm can this Paris gentleman do the prisoners?" He was on the\r\npoint of quite losing his temper when she gave a cry. Her second son\r\nhad mounted the parapet of the terrace wall and was running along it,\r\nalthough the wall was raised to a height of more than twenty feet above\r\nthe vineyard on the other side. The fear of frightening her son and\r\nmaking him fall prevented Madame de R\xc3\xaanal speaking to him. But at last\r\nthe child, who was smiling at his own pluck, looked at his mother, saw\r\nher pallor, jumped down on to the walk and ran to her. He was well\r\nscolded.\r\n\r\nThis little event changed the course of the conversation.\r\n\r\n"I really mean to take Sorel, the son of the sawyer, into the house,"\r\nsaid M. de R\xc3\xaanal; "he will look after the children, who are getting too\r\nnaughty for us to manage. He is a young priest, or as good as one, a\r\ngood Latin scholar, and will make the children get on. According to the\r\ncur\xc3\xa9, he has a steady character. I will give him three hundred francs a\r\nyear and his board. I have some doubts as to his morality, for he used\r\nto be the favourite of that old Surgeon-Major, Member of the Legion of\r\nHonour, who went to board with the Sorels, on the pretext that he was\r\ntheir cousin. It is quite possible that that man was really simply a\r\nsecret agent of the Liberals. He said that the mountain air did his\r\nasthma good, but that is something which has never been proved. He\r\nhas gone through all _Buonaparte\'s_ campaigns in Italy, and had even,\r\nit was said, voted against the Empire in the plebiscite. This Liberal\r\ntaught the Sorel boy Latin, and left him a number of books which he had\r\nbrought with him. Of course, in the ordinary way, I should have never\r\nthought of allowing a carpenter\'s son to come into contact with our\r\nchildren, but the cur\xc3\xa9 told me, the very day before the scene which\r\nhas just estranged us for ever, that Sorel has been studying theology\r\nfor three years with the intention of entering a seminary. He is,\r\nconsequently, not a Liberal, and he certainly is a good Latin scholar.\r\n\r\n"This arrangement will be convenient in more than one way," continued\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal, looking at his wife with a diplomatic air. "That Valenod\r\nis proud enough of his two fine Norman horses which he has just bought\r\nfor his carriage, but he hasn\'t a tutor for his children."\r\n\r\n"He might take this one away from us."\r\n\r\n"You approve of my plan, then?" said M. de R\xc3\xaanal, thanking his wife\r\nwith a smile for the excellent idea which she had just had. "Well,\r\nthat\'s settled."\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, my dear, how quickly you make up your mind!"\r\n\r\n"It is because I\'m a man of character, as the cur\xc3\xa9 found out right\r\nenough. Don\'t let us deceive ourselves; we are surrounded by Liberals\r\nin this place. All those cloth merchants are jealous of me, I am\r\ncertain of it; two or three are becoming rich men. Well, I should\r\nrather fancy it for them to see M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s children pass along the\r\nstreet as they go out for their walk, escorted by _their tutor_. It\r\nwill impress people. My grandfather often used to tell us that he had\r\na tutor when he was young. It may run me into a hundred crowns, but\r\nthat ought to be looked upon as an expense necessary for keeping up our\r\nposition."\r\n\r\nThis sudden resolution left Madame de R\xc3\xaanal quite pensive. She was\r\na big, well-made woman, who had been the beauty of the country, to\r\nuse the local expression. She had a certain air of simplicity and\r\nyouthfulness in her deportment. This na\xc3\xafve grace, with its innocence\r\nand its vivacity, might even have recalled to a Parisian some\r\nsuggestion of the sweets he had left behind him. If she had realised\r\nthis particular phase of her success, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal would have been\r\nquite ashamed of it. All coquetry, all affectation, were absolutely\r\nalien to her temperament. M. Valenod, the rich director of the\r\nworkhouse, had the reputation of having paid her court, a fact which\r\nhad cast a singular glamour over her virtue; for this M. Valenod, a\r\nbig young man with a square, sturdy frame, florid face, and big, black\r\nwhiskers, was one of those coarse, blustering, and noisy people who\r\npass in the provinces for a "fine man."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal, who had a very shy, and apparently a very uneven\r\ntemperament, was particularly shocked by M. Valenod\'s lack of repose,\r\nand by his boisterous loudness. Her aloofness from what, in the\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res\' jargon, was called "having a good time," had earned her the\r\nreputation of being very proud of her birth. In fact, she never thought\r\nabout it, but she had been extremely glad to find the inhabitants of\r\nthe town visit her less frequently. We shall not deny that she passed\r\nfor a fool in the eyes of _their_ good ladies because she did not\r\nwheedle her husband, and allowed herself to miss the most splendid\r\nopportunities of getting fine hats from Paris or Besan\xc3\xa7on. Provided she\r\nwas allowed to wander in her beautiful garden, she never complained.\r\nShe was a na\xc3\xafve soul, who had never educated herself up to the point\r\nof judging her husband and confessing to herself that he bored her.\r\nShe supposed, without actually formulating the thought, that there was\r\nno greater sweetness in the relationship between husband and wife than\r\nshe herself had experienced. She loved M. de R\xc3\xaanal most when he talked\r\nabout his projects for their children. The elder he had destined for\r\nthe army, the second for the law, and the third for the Church. To sum\r\nup, she found M. de R\xc3\xaanal much less boring than all the other men of\r\nher acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThis conjugal opinion was quite sound. The Mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res had a\r\nreputation for wit, and above all, a reputation for good form, on\r\nthe strength of half-a-dozen "chestnuts" which he had inherited from\r\nan uncle. Old Captain de R\xc3\xaanal had served, before the Revolution, in\r\nthe infantry regiment of M. the Duke of Orleans, and was admitted\r\nto the Prince\'s salons when he went to Paris. He had seen Madame de\r\nMontesson, the famous Madame de Genlis, M. Ducret, the inventor, of the\r\nPalais-Royal. These personages would crop up only too frequently in M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal\'s anecdotes. He found it, however, more and more of a strain\r\nto remember stories which required such delicacy in the telling, and\r\nfor some time past it had only been on great occasions that he would\r\ntrot out his anecdotes concerning the House of Orleans. As, moreover,\r\nhe was extremely polite, except on money matters, he passed, and justly\r\nso, for the most aristocratic personage in Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA FATHER AND A SON\r\n\r\n\r\n    E sara mia colpa\r\n    Se cosi \xc3\xa8?\r\n                  --_Machiavelli_.\r\n\r\n\r\n"My wife really has a head on her shoulders," said the mayor of\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res at six o\'clock the following morning, as he went down to the\r\nsaw-mill of Father Sorel. "It had never occurred to me that if I do not\r\ntake little Abb\xc3\xa9 Sorel, who, they say, knows Latin like an angel, that\r\nrestless spirit, the director of the workhouse, might have the same\r\nidea and snatch him away from me, though of course I told her that it\r\nhad, in order to preserve my proper superiority. And how smugly, to be\r\nsure, would he talk about his children\'s tutor!... The question is,\r\nonce the tutor\'s mine, shall he wear the cassock?"\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal was absorbed in this problem when he saw a peasant in the\r\ndistance, a man nearly six feet tall, who since dawn had apparently\r\nbeen occupied in measuring some pieces of wood which had been put\r\ndown alongside the Doubs on the towing-path. The peasant did not look\r\nparticularly pleased when he saw M. the Mayor approach, as these pieces\r\nof wood obstructed the road, and had been placed there in breach of the\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nFather Sorel (for it was he) was very surprised, and even more pleased\r\nat the singular offer which M. de R\xc3\xaanal made him for his son Julien.\r\nNone the less, he listened to it with that air of sulky discontent and\r\napathy which the subtle inhabitants of these mountains know so well\r\nhow to assume. Slaves as they have been since the time of the Spanish\r\nConquest, they still preserve this feature, which is also found in the\r\ncharacter of the Egyptian fellah.\r\n\r\nSorel\'s answer was at first simply a long-winded recitation of\r\nall the formulas of respect which he knew by heart. While he was\r\nrepeating these empty words with an uneasy smile, which accentuated\r\nall the natural disingenuousness, if not, indeed, knavishness of his\r\nphysiognomy, the active mind of the old peasant tried to discover what\r\nreason could induce so important a man to take into his house his\r\ngood-for-nothing of a son. He was very dissatisfied with Julien, and\r\nit was for Julien that M. de R\xc3\xaanal offered the undreamt-of salary of\r\n300 fcs. a year, with board and even clothing. This latter claim, which\r\nFather Sorel had had the genius to spring upon the mayor, had been\r\ngranted with equal suddenness by M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nThis demand made an impression on the mayor. It is clear, he said to\r\nhimself, that since Sorel is not beside himself with delight over my\r\nproposal, as in the ordinary way he ought to be, he must have had\r\noffers made to him elsewhere, and whom could they have come from, if\r\nnot from Valenod. It was in vain that M. de R\xc3\xaanal pressed Sorel to\r\nclinch the matter then and there. The old peasant, astute man that\r\nhe was, stubbornly refused to do so. He wanted, he said, to consult\r\nhis son, as if in the provinces, forsooth, a rich father consulted a\r\npenniless son for any other reason than as a mere matter of form.\r\n\r\nA water saw-mill consists of a shed by the side of a stream. The roof\r\nis supported by a framework resting on four large timber pillars. A\r\nsaw can be seen going up and down at a height of eight to ten feet in\r\nthe middle of the shed, while a piece of wood is propelled against\r\nthis saw by a very simple mechanism. It is a wheel whose motive-power\r\nis supplied by the stream, which sets in motion this double piece of\r\nmechanism, the mechanism of the saw which goes up and down, and the\r\nmechanism which gently pushes the piece of wood towards the saw, which\r\ncuts it up into planks.\r\n\r\nApproaching his workshop, Father Sorel called Julien in his stentorian\r\nvoice; nobody answered. He only saw his giant elder sons, who, armed\r\nwith heavy axes, were cutting up the pine planks which they had to\r\ncarry to the saw. They were engrossed in following exactly the black\r\nmark traced on each piece of wood, from which every blow of their axes\r\nthrew off enormous shavings. They did not hear their father\'s voice.\r\nThe latter made his way towards the shed. He entered it and looked in\r\nvain for Julien in the place where he ought to have been by the side of\r\nthe saw. He saw him five or six feet higher up, sitting astride one of\r\nthe rafters of the roof. Instead of watching attentively the action of\r\nthe machinery, Julien was reading. Nothing was more anti-pathetic to\r\nold Sorel. He might possibly have forgiven Julien his puny physique,\r\nill adapted as it was to manual labour, and different as it was from\r\nthat of his elder brothers; but he hated this reading mania. He could\r\nnot read himself.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that he called Julien two or three times. It was the\r\nyoung man\'s concentration on his book, rather than the din made by the\r\nsaw, which prevented him from hearing his father\'s terrible voice. At\r\nlast the latter, in spite of his age, jumped nimbly on to the tree\r\nthat was undergoing the action of the saw, and from there on to the\r\ncross-bar that supported the roof. A violent blow made the book which\r\nJulien held, go flying into the stream; a second blow on the head,\r\nequally violent, which took the form of a box on the ears, made him\r\nlose his balance. He was on the point of falling twelve or fifteen feet\r\nlower down into the middle of the levers of the running machinery which\r\nwould have cut him to pieces, but his father caught him as he fell, in\r\nhis left hand.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s it, is it, lazy bones! always going to read your damned\r\nbooks are you, when you\'re keeping watch on the saw? You read them in\r\nthe evening if you want to, when you go to play the fool at the cur\xc3\xa9\'s,\r\nthat\'s the proper time."\r\n\r\nAlthough stunned by the force of the blow and bleeding profusely,\r\nJulien went back to his official post by the side of the saw. He had\r\ntears in his eyes, less by reason of the physical pain than on account\r\nof the loss of his beloved book.\r\n\r\n"Get down, you beast, when I am talking to you," the noise of the\r\nmachinery prevented Julien from hearing this order. His father, who had\r\ngone down did not wish to give himself the trouble of climbing up on to\r\nthe machinery again, and went to fetch a long fork used for bringing\r\ndown nuts, with which he struck him on the shoulder. Julien had\r\nscarcely reached the ground, when old Sorel chased him roughly in front\r\nof him and pushed him roughly towards the house. "God knows what he is\r\ngoing to do with me," said the young man to himself. As he passed, he\r\nlooked sorrowfully into the stream into which his book had fallen, it\r\nwas the one that he held dearest of all, the _Memorial of St. Helena_.\r\n\r\nHe had purple cheeks and downcast eyes. He was a young man of eighteen\r\nto nineteen years old, and of puny appearance, with irregular but\r\ndelicate features, and an aquiline nose. The big black eyes which\r\nbetokened in their tranquil moments a temperament at once fiery and\r\nreflective were at the present moment animated by an expression of\r\nthe most ferocious hate. Dark chestnut hair, which came low down over\r\nhis brow, made his forehead appear small and gave him a sinister look\r\nduring his angry moods. It is doubtful if any face out of all the\r\ninnumerable varieties of the human physiognomy was ever distinguished\r\nby a more arresting individuality.\r\n\r\nA supple well-knit figure, indicated agility rather than strength. His\r\nair of extreme pensiveness and his great pallor had given his father\r\nthe idea that he would not live, or that if he did, it would only be to\r\nbe a burden to his family. The butt of the whole house, he hated his\r\nbrothers and his father. He was regularly beaten in the Sunday sports\r\nin the public square.\r\n\r\nA little less than a year ago his pretty face had begun to win him some\r\nsympathy among the young girls. Universally despised as a weakling,\r\nJulien had adored that old Surgeon-Major, who had one day dared to talk\r\nto the mayor on the subject of the plane trees.\r\n\r\nThis Surgeon had sometimes paid Father Sorel for taking his son for\r\na day, and had taught him Latin and History, that is to say the 1796\r\nCampaign in Italy which was all the history he knew. When he died, he\r\nhad bequeathed his Cross of the Legion of Honour, his arrears of half\r\npay, and thirty or forty volumes, of which the most precious had just\r\nfallen into the public stream, which had been diverted owing to the\r\ninfluence of M. the Mayor.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he entered the house, when Julien felt his shoulder\r\ngripped by his father\'s powerful hand; he trembled, expecting some\r\nblows.\r\n\r\n"Answer me without lying," cried the harsh voice of the old peasant in\r\nhis ears, while his hand turned him round and round, like a child\'s\r\nhand turns round a lead soldier. The big black eyes of Julien filled\r\nwith tears, and were confronted by the small grey eyes of the old\r\ncarpenter, who looked as if he meant to read to the very bottom of his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA NEGOTIATION\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cunctando restituit rem.--_Ennius_.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Answer me without lies, if you can, you damned dog, how did you get to\r\nknow Madame de R\xc3\xaanal? When did you speak to her?"\r\n\r\n"I have never spoken to her," answered Julien, "I have only seen that\r\nlady in church."\r\n\r\n"You must have looked at her, you impudent rascal."\r\n\r\n"Not once! you know, I only see God in church," answered Julien, with\r\na little hypocritical air, well suited, so he thought, to keep off the\r\nparental claws.\r\n\r\n"None the less there\'s something that does not meet the eye," answered\r\nthe cunning peasant. He was then silent for a moment. "But I shall\r\nnever get anything out of you, you damned hypocrite," he went on. "As a\r\nmatter of fact, I am going to get rid of you, and my saw-mill will go\r\nall the better for it. You have nobbled the curate, or somebody else,\r\nwho has got you a good place. Run along and pack your traps, and I\r\nwill take you to M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s, where you are going to be tutor to his\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\n"What shall I get for that?"\r\n\r\n"Board, clothing, and three hundred francs salary."\r\n\r\n"I do not want to be a servant."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s talking of being a servant, you brute, do you think I want my\r\nson to be a servant?"\r\n\r\n"But with whom shall I have my meals?"\r\n\r\nThis question discomforted old Sorel, who felt he might possibly commit\r\nsome imprudence if he went on talking. He burst out against Julien,\r\nflung insult after insult at him, accused him of gluttony, and left him\r\nto go and consult his other sons.\r\n\r\nJulien saw them afterwards, each one leaning on his axe and holding\r\ncounsel. Having looked at them for a long time, Julien saw that he\r\ncould find out nothing, and went and stationed himself on the other\r\nside of the saw in order to avoid being surprised. He wanted to think\r\nover this unexpected piece of news, which changed his whole life,\r\nbut he felt himself unable to consider the matter prudently, his\r\nimagination being concentrated in wondering what he would see in M. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal\'s fine mansion.\r\n\r\n"I must give all that up," he said to himself, "rather than let myself\r\nbe reduced to eating with the servants. My father would like to force\r\nme to it. I would rather die. I have fifteen francs and eight sous of\r\nsavings. I will run away to-night; I will go across country by paths\r\nwhere there are no gendarmes to be feared, and in two days I shall be\r\nat Besan\xc3\xa7on. I will enlist as a soldier there, and, if necessary, I\r\nwill cross into Switzerland. But in that case, no more advancement, it\r\nwill be all up with my being a priest, that fine career which may lead\r\nto anything."\r\n\r\nThis abhorrence of eating with the servants was not really natural to\r\nJulien; he would have done things quite, if not more, disagreeable in\r\norder to get on. He derived this repugnance from the _Confessions_\r\nof Rousseau. It was the only book by whose help his imagination\r\nendeavoured to construct the world. The collection of the Bulletins of\r\nthe Grand Army, and the _Memorial of St. Helena_ completed his Koran.\r\nHe would have died for these three works. He never believed in any\r\nother. To use a phrase of the old Surgeon-Major, he regarded all the\r\nother books in the world as packs of lies, written by rogues in order\r\nto get on.\r\n\r\nJulien possessed both a fiery soul and one of those astonishing\r\nmemories which are so often combined with stupidity.\r\n\r\nIn order to win over the old cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan, on whose good grace he\r\nrealized that his future prospects depended, he had learnt by heart the\r\nNew Testament in Latin. He also knew M. de Maistre\'s book on The Pope,\r\nand believed in one as little as he did in the other.\r\n\r\nSorel and his son avoided talking to each other to-day as though by\r\nmutual consent. In the evening Julien went to take his theology lesson\r\nat the cur\xc3\xa9\'s, but he did not consider that it was prudent to say\r\nanything to him about the strange proposal which had been made to his\r\nfather. "It is possibly a trap," he said to himself, "I must pretend\r\nthat I have forgotten all about it."\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, M. de R\xc3\xaanal had old Sorel summoned to him.\r\nHe eventually arrived, after keeping M. de R\xc3\xaanal waiting for an\r\nhour-and-a-half, and made, as he entered the room, a hundred apologies\r\ninterspersed with as many bows. After having run the gauntlet of all\r\nkinds of objections, Sorel was given to understand that his son would\r\nhave his meals with the master and mistress of the house, and that\r\nhe would eat alone in a room with the children on the days when they\r\nhad company. The more clearly Sorel realized the genuine eagerness of\r\nM. the Mayor, the more difficulties he felt inclined to raise. Being\r\nmoreover full of mistrust and astonishment, he asked to see the room\r\nwhere his son would sleep. It was a big room, quite decently furnished,\r\ninto which the servants were already engaged in carrying the beds of\r\nthe three children.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance explained a lot to the old peasant. He asked\r\nimmediately, with quite an air of assurance, to see the suit which\r\nwould be given to his son. M. de R\xc3\xaanal opened his desk and took out one\r\nhundred francs.\r\n\r\n"Your son will go to M. Durand, the draper, with this money and will\r\nget a complete black suit."\r\n\r\n"And even supposing I take him away from you," said the peasant, who\r\nhad suddenly forgotten all his respectful formalities, "will he still\r\nkeep this black suit?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Sorel, in a drawling voice, "all that remains to do is to\r\nagree on just one thing, the money which you will give him."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed M. de R\xc3\xaanal, indignantly, "we agreed on that\r\nyesterday. I shall give him three hundred francs, I think that is a\r\nlot, and probably too much."\r\n\r\n"That is your offer and I do not deny it," said old Sorel, speaking\r\nstill very slowly; and by a stroke of genius which will only astonish\r\nthose who do not know the Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9 peasants, he fixed his eyes on\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal and added, "We shall get better terms elsewhere."\r\n\r\nThe Mayor\'s face exhibited the utmost consternation at these words. He\r\npulled himself together however and after a cunning conversation of\r\ntwo hours\' length, where every single word on both sides was carefully\r\nweighed, the subtlety of the peasant scored a victory over the subtlety\r\nof the rich man, whose livelihood was not so dependent on his faculty\r\nof cunning. All the numerous stipulations which were to regulate\r\nJulien\'s new existence were duly formulated. Not only was his salary\r\nfixed at four hundred francs, but they were to be paid in advance on\r\nthe first of each month.\r\n\r\n"Very well, I will give him thirty-five francs," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure," said the peasant, in a fawning voice, "that a rich,\r\ngenerous man like the M. mayor would go as far as thirty-six francs, to\r\nmake up a good round sum."\r\n\r\n"Agreed!" said M. de R\xc3\xaanal, "but let this be final." For the moment his\r\ntemper gave him a tone of genuine firmness. The peasant saw that it\r\nwould not do to go any further.\r\n\r\nThen, on his side, M. de R\xc3\xaanal managed to score. He absolutely refused\r\nto give old Sorel, who was very anxious to receive it on behalf of his\r\nson, the thirty-six francs for the first month. It had occurred to M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal that he would have to tell his wife the figure which he had\r\ncut throughout these negotiations.\r\n\r\n"Hand me back the hundred francs which I gave you," he said sharply.\r\n"M. Durand owes me something, I will go with your son to see about a\r\nblack cloth suit."\r\n\r\nAfter this manifestation of firmness, Sorel had the prudence to return\r\nto his respectful formulas; they took a good quarter of an hour.\r\nFinally, seeing that there was nothing more to be gained, he took his\r\nleave. He finished his last bow with these words:\r\n\r\n"I will send my son to the Ch\xc3\xa2teau." The Mayor\'s officials called his\r\nhouse by this designation when they wanted to humour him.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to his workshop, it was in vain that Sorel sought his\r\nson. Suspicious of what might happen, Julien had gone out in the middle\r\nof the night. He wished to place his Cross of the Legion of Honour and\r\nhis books in a place of safety. He had taken everything to a young\r\nwood-merchant named Fouqu\xc3\xa9, who was a friend of his, and who lived in\r\nthe high mountain which commands Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\n"God knows, you damned lazy bones," said his father to him when he\r\nre-appeared, "if you will ever be sufficiently honourable to pay me\r\nback the price of your board which I have been advancing to you for so\r\nmany years. Take your rags and clear out to M. the Mayor\'s."\r\n\r\nJulien was astonished at not being beaten and hastened to leave. He\r\nhad scarcely got out of sight of his terrible father when he slackened\r\nhis pace. He considered that it would assist the r\xc3\xb4le played by his\r\nhypocrisy to go and say a prayer in the church.\r\n\r\nThe word hypocrisy surprises you? The soul of the peasant had had to go\r\nthrough a great deal before arriving at this horrible word.\r\n\r\nJulien had seen in the days of his early childhood certain Dragoons\r\nof the 6th[1] with long white cloaks and hats covered with long black\r\nplumed helmets who were returning from Italy, and tied up their horses\r\nto the grilled window of his father\'s house. The sight had made him mad\r\non the military profession. Later on he had listened with ecstasy to\r\nthe narrations of the battles of Lodi, Arcola and Rivoli with which the\r\nold surgeon-major had regaled him. He observed the ardent gaze which\r\nthe old man used to direct towards his cross.\r\n\r\nBut when Julien was fourteen years of age they commenced to build a\r\nchurch at Verri\xc3\xa8res which, in view of the smallness of the town, has\r\nsome claim to be called magnificent. There were four marble columns in\r\nparticular, the sight of which impressed Julien. They became celebrated\r\nin the district owing to the mortal hate which they raised between\r\nthe Justice of the Peace and the young vicar who had been sent from\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on and who passed for a spy of the congregation. The Justice of\r\nthe Peace was on the point of losing his place, so said the public\r\nopinion at any rate. Had he not dared to have a difference with the\r\npriest who went every fortnight to Besan\xc3\xa7on; where he saw, so they\r\nsaid, my Lord the Bishop.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Justice of the Peace, who was the father of a\r\nnumerous family, gave several sentences which seemed unjust: all these\r\nsentences were inflicted on those of the inhabitants who read the\r\n"_Constitutionnel_." The right party triumphed. It is true it was only a\r\nquestion of sums of three or five francs, but one of these little fines\r\nhad to be paid by a nail-maker, who was god-father to Julien. This man\r\nexclaimed in his anger "What a change! and to think that for more than\r\ntwenty years the Justice of the Peace has passed for an honest man."\r\n\r\nThe Surgeon-Major, Julien\'s friend, died. Suddenly Julien left off\r\ntalking about Napoleon. He announced his intention of becoming a\r\npriest, and was always to be seen in his father\'s workshop occupied\r\nin learning by heart the Latin Bible which the cur\xc3\xa9 had lent him. The\r\ngood old man was astonished at his progress, and passed whole evenings\r\nin teaching him theology. In his society Julien did not manifest other\r\nthan pious sentiments. Who could not possibly guess that beneath this\r\ngirlish face, so pale and so sweet, lurked the unbreakable resolution\r\nto risk a thousand deaths rather than fail to make his fortune. Making\r\nhis fortune primarily meant to Julien getting out of Verri\xc3\xa8res: he\r\nabhorred his native country; everything that he saw there froze his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nHe had had moments of exultation since his earliest childhood. He would\r\nthen dream with gusto of being presented one day to the pretty women\r\nof Paris. He would manage to attract their attention by some dazzling\r\nfeat: why should he not be loved by one of them just as Buonaparte,\r\nwhen still poor, had been loved by the brilliant Madame de Beauharnais.\r\nFor many years past Julien had scarcely passed a single year of his\r\nlife without reminding himself that Buonaparte, the obscure and\r\npenniless lieutenant, had made himself master of the whole world by the\r\npower of his sword. This idea consoled him for his misfortune, which\r\nhe considered to be great, and rendered such joyful moments as he had\r\ndoubly intense.\r\n\r\nThe building of the church and the sentences pronounced by the Justice\r\nof the Peace suddenly enlightened him. An idea came to him which made\r\nhim almost mad for some weeks, and finally took complete possession of\r\nhim with all the magic that a first idea possesses for a passionate\r\nsoul which believes that it is original.\r\n\r\n"At the time when Buonaparte got himself talked about, France was\r\nfrightened of being invaded; military distinction was necessary and\r\nfashionable. Nowadays, one sees priests of forty with salaries of\r\n100,000 francs, that is to say, three times as much as Napoleon\'s\r\nfamous generals of a division. They need persons to assist them. Look\r\nat that Justice of the Peace, such a good sort and such an honest man\r\nup to the present and so old too; he sacrifices his honour through the\r\nfear of incurring the displeasure of a young vicar of thirty. I must be\r\na priest."\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, in the middle of his new-found piety (he had already\r\nbeen studying theology for two years), he was betrayed by a sudden\r\nburst of fire which consumed his soul. It was at M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan\'s. The\r\ngood cur\xc3\xa9 had invited him to a dinner of priests, and he actually let\r\nhimself praise Napoleon with enthusiasm. He bound his right arm over\r\nhis breast, pretending that he had dislocated it in moving a trunk of a\r\npine-tree and carried it for two months in that painful position. After\r\nthis painful penance, he forgave himself. This is the young man of\r\neighteen with a puny physique, and scarcely looking more than seventeen\r\nat the outside, who entered the magnificent church of Verri\xc3\xa8res\r\ncarrying a little parcel under his arm.\r\n\r\nHe found it gloomy and deserted. All the transepts in the building had\r\nbeen covered with crimson cloth in celebration of a feast. The result\r\nwas that the sun\'s rays produced an effect of dazzling light of the\r\nmost impressive and religious character. Julien shuddered. Finding\r\nhimself alone in the church, he established himself in the pew which\r\nhad the most magnificent appearance. It bore the arms of M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nJulien noticed a piece of printed paper spread out on the stool, which\r\nwas apparently intended to be read, he cast his eyes over it and\r\nsaw:--"_Details of the execution and the last moments of Louis Jenrel,\r\nexecuted at Besan\xc3\xa7on the...._" The paper was torn. The two first words\r\nof a line were legible on the back, they were, "_The First Step_."\r\n\r\n"Who could have put this paper there?" said Julien. "Poor fellow!" he\r\nadded with a sigh, "the last syllable of his name is the same as mine,"\r\nand he crumpled up the paper. As he left, Julien thought he saw blood\r\nnear the Host, it was holy water which the priests had been sprinkling\r\non it, the reflection of the red curtains which covered the windows\r\nmade it look like blood.\r\n\r\nFinally, Julien felt ashamed of his secret terror. "Am I going to play\r\nthe coward," he said to himself: "_To Arms!_" This phrase, repeated so\r\noften in the old Surgeon-Major\'s battle stories, symbolized heroism to\r\nJulien. He got up rapidly and walked to M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s house. As soon\r\nas he saw it twenty yards in front of him he was seized, in spite of\r\nhis fine resolution, with an overwhelming timidity. The iron grill was\r\nopen. He thought it was magnificent. He had to go inside.\r\n\r\nJulien was not the only person whose heart was troubled by his arrival\r\nin the house. The extreme timidity of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was fluttered\r\nwhen she thought of this stranger whose functions would necessitate\r\nhis coming between her and her children. She was accustomed to seeing\r\nher sons sleep in her own room. She had shed many tears that morning,\r\nwhen she had seen their beds carried into the apartment intended for\r\nthe tutor. It was in vain that she asked her husband to have the bed of\r\nStanislas-Xavier, the youngest, carried back into her room.\r\n\r\nWomanly delicacy was carried in Madame de R\xc3\xaanal to the point of excess.\r\nShe conjured up in her imagination the most disagreeable personage, who\r\nwas coarse, badly groomed and encharged with the duty of scolding her\r\nchildren simply because he happened to know Latin, and only too ready\r\nto flog her sons for their ignorance of that barbarous language.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The author was sub-lieutenant in the 6th Dragoons in 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nENNUI\r\n\r\n\r\n    Non so pi\xc3\xba cosa son\r\n    Cosa facio.\r\n                     MOZART (_Figaro_).\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was going out of the salon by the folding window which\r\nopened on to the garden with that vivacity and grace which was natural\r\nto her when she was free from human observation, when she noticed a\r\nyoung peasant near the entrance gate. He was still almost a child,\r\nextremely pale, and looked as though he had been crying. He was in a\r\nwhite shirt and had under his arm a perfectly new suit of violet frieze.\r\n\r\nThe little peasant\'s complexion was so white and his eyes were so soft,\r\nthat Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s somewhat romantic spirit thought at first that\r\nit might be a young girl in disguise, who had come to ask some favour\r\nof the M. the Mayor. She took pity on this poor creature, who had\r\nstopped at the entrance of the door, and who apparently did not dare\r\nto raise its hand to the bell. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal approached, forgetting\r\nfor the moment the bitter chagrin occasioned by the tutor\'s arrival.\r\nJulien, who was turned towards the gate, did not see her advance. He\r\ntrembled when a soft voice said quite close to his ear:\r\n\r\n"What do you want here, my child."\r\n\r\nJulien turned round sharply and was so struck by Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s\r\nlook, full of graciousness as it was, that up to a certain point he\r\nforgot to be nervous. Overcome by her beauty he soon forgot everything,\r\neven what he had come for. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal repeated her question.\r\n\r\n"I have come here to be tutor, Madame," he said at last, quite ashamed\r\nof his tears which he was drying as best as he could.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal remained silent. They had a view of each other at close\r\nrange. Julien had never seen a human being so well-dressed, and above\r\nall he had never seen a woman with so dazzling a complexion speak to\r\nhim at all softly. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal observed the big tears which had\r\nlingered on the cheeks of the young peasant, those cheeks which had\r\nbeen so pale and were now so pink. Soon she began to laugh with all the\r\nmad gaiety of a young girl, she made fun of herself, and was unable to\r\nrealise the extent of her happiness. So this was that tutor whom she\r\nhad imagined a dirty, badly dressed priest, who was coming to scold and\r\nflog her children.\r\n\r\n"What! Monsieur," she said to him at last, "you know Latin?"\r\n\r\nThe word "Monsieur" astonished Julien so much that he reflected for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Madame," he said timidly.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was so happy that she plucked up the courage to say to\r\nJulien, "You will not scold the poor children too much?"\r\n\r\n"I scold them!" said Julien in astonishment; "why should I?"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t, will you, Monsieur," she added after a little silence, in\r\na soft voice whose emotion became more and more intense. "You will be\r\nnice to them, you promise me?"\r\n\r\nTo hear himself called "Monsieur" again in all seriousness by so well\r\ndressed a lady was beyond all Julien\'s expectations. He had always said\r\nto himself in all the castles of Spain that he had built in his youth,\r\nthat no real lady would ever condescend to talk to him except when he\r\nhad a fine uniform. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, on her side, was completely taken\r\nin by Julien\'s beautiful complexion, his big black eyes, and his pretty\r\nhair, which was more than usually curly, because he had just plunged\r\nhis head into the basin of the public fountain in order to refresh\r\nhimself. She was over-joyed to find that this sinister tutor, whom\r\nshe had feared to find so harsh and severe to her children, had, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the timid manner of a girl. The contrast between her\r\nfears and what she now saw, proved a great event for Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s\r\npeaceful temperament. Finally, she recovered from her surprise. She\r\nwas astonished to find herself at the gate of her own house talking in\r\nthis way and at such close quarters to this young and somewhat scantily\r\ndressed man.\r\n\r\n"Let us go in, Monsieur," she said to him with a certain air of\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nDuring Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s whole life she had never been so deeply moved\r\nby such a sense of pure pleasure. Never had so gracious a vision\r\nfollowed in the wake of her disconcerting fears. So these pretty\r\nchildren of whom she took such care were not after all to fall into\r\nthe hands of a dirty grumbling priest. She had scarcely entered the\r\nvestibule when she turned round towards Julien, who was following her\r\ntrembling. His astonishment at the sight of so fine a house proved but\r\nan additional charm in Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s eyes. She could not believe\r\nher own eyes. It seemed to her, above all, that the tutor ought to have\r\na black suit.\r\n\r\n"But is it true, Monsieur," she said to him, stopping once again, and\r\nin mortal fear that she had made a mistake, so happy had her discovery\r\nmade her. "Is it true that you know Latin?" These words offended\r\nJulien\'s pride, and dissipated the charming atmosphere which he had\r\nbeen enjoying for the last quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Madame," he said, trying to assume an air of coldness, "I know\r\nLatin as well as the cur\xc3\xa9, who has been good enough to say sometimes\r\nthat I know it even better."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal thought that Julien looked extremely wicked. He had\r\nstopped two paces from her. She approached and said to him in a whisper:\r\n\r\n"You won\'t beat my children the first few days, will you, even if they\r\ndo not know their lessons?"\r\n\r\nThe softness and almost supplication of so beautiful a lady made Julien\r\nsuddenly forget what he owed to his reputation as a Latinist. Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal\'s face was close to his own. He smelt the perfume of a woman\'s\r\nsummer clothing, a quite astonishing experience for a poor peasant.\r\nJulien blushed extremely, and said with a sigh in a faltering voice:\r\n\r\n"Fear nothing, Madame, I will obey you in everything."\r\n\r\nIt was only now, when her anxiety about her children had been relieved\r\nonce and for all, that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was struck by Julien\'s extreme\r\nbeauty. The comparative effeminancy of his features and his air of\r\nextreme embarrassment did not seem in any way ridiculous to a woman who\r\nwas herself extremely timid. The male air, which is usually considered\r\nessential to a man\'s beauty, would have terrified her.\r\n\r\n"How old are you, sir," she said to Julien.\r\n\r\n"Nearly nineteen."\r\n\r\n"My elder son is eleven," went on Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, who had completely\r\nrecovered her confidence. "He will be almost a chum for you. You will\r\ntalk sensibly to him. His father started beating him once. The child\r\nwas ill for a whole week, and yet it was only a little tap."\r\n\r\nWhat a difference between him and me, thought Julien. Why, it was only\r\nyesterday that my father beat me. How happy these rich people are.\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal, who had already begun to observe the fine nuances of\r\nthe workings in the tutor\'s mind, took this fit of sadness for timidity\r\nand tried to encourage him.\r\n\r\n"What is your name, Monsieur?" she said to him, with an accent and\r\na graciousness whose charm Julien appreciated without being able to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n"I am called Julien Sorel, Madame. I feel nervous of entering a strange\r\nhouse for the first time in my life. I have need of your protection\r\nand I want you to make many allowances for me during the first few\r\ndays. I have never been to the college, I was too poor. I have never\r\nspoken to anyone else except my cousin who was Surgeon-Major, Member\r\nof the Legion of Honour, and M. the cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan. He will give you a\r\ngood account of me. My brothers always used to beat me, and you must\r\nnot believe them if they speak badly of me to you. You must forgive my\r\nfaults, Madame. I shall always mean everything for the best."\r\n\r\nJulien had regained his confidence during this long speech. He was\r\nexamining Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. Perfect grace works wonders when it is\r\nnatural to the character, and above all, when the person whom it\r\nadorns never thinks of trying to affect it. Julien, who was quite a\r\nconnoisseur in feminine beauty, would have sworn at this particular\r\nmoment that she was not more than twenty. The rash idea of kissing her\r\nhand immediately occurred to him. He soon became frightened of his\r\nidea. A minute later he said to himself, it will be an act of cowardice\r\nif I do not carry out an action which may be useful to me, and lessen\r\nthe contempt which this fine lady probably has for a poor workman just\r\ntaken away from the saw-mill. Possibly Julien was a little encouraged\r\nthrough having heard some young girls repeat on Sundays during the last\r\nsix months the words "pretty boy."\r\n\r\nDuring this internal debate, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was giving him two or\r\nthree hints on the way to commence handling the children. The strain\r\nJulien was putting on himself made him once more very pale. He said\r\nwith an air of constraint.\r\n\r\n"I will never beat your children, Madame. I swear it before God." In\r\nsaying this, he dared to take Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s hand and carry it\r\nto his lips. She was astonished at this act, and after reflecting,\r\nbecame shocked. As the weather was very warm, her arm was quite bare\r\nunderneath the shawl, and Julien\'s movement in carrying her hand to his\r\nlips entirely uncovered it. After a few moments she scolded herself. It\r\nseemed to her that her anger had not been quick enough.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal, who had heard voices, came out of his study, and assuming\r\nthe same air of paternal majesty with which he celebrated marriages at\r\nthe mayoral office, said to Julien:\r\n\r\n"It is essential for me to have a few words with you before my children\r\nsee you." He made Julien enter a room and insisted on his wife being\r\npresent, although she wished to leave them alone. Having closed the\r\ndoor M. R\xc3\xaanal sat down.\r\n\r\n"M. the cur\xc3\xa9 has told me that you are a worthy person, and everybody\r\nhere will treat you with respect. If I am satisfied with you I will\r\nlater on help you in having a little establishment of your own. I do\r\nnot wish you to see either anything more of your relatives or your\r\nfriends. Their tone is bound to be prejudicial to my children. Here are\r\nthirty-six francs for the first month, but I insist on your word not to\r\ngive a sou of this money to your father."\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal was piqued against the old man for having proved the\r\nshrewder bargainer.\r\n\r\n"Now, Monsieur, for I have given orders for everybody here to call you\r\nMonsieur, and you will appreciate the advantage of having entered the\r\nhouse of real gentle folk, now, Monsieur, it is not becoming for the\r\nchildren to see you in a jacket." "Have the servants seen him?" said M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal to his wife.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear," she answered, with an air of deep pensiveness.\r\n\r\n"All the better. Put this on," he said to the surprised young man,\r\ngiving him a frock-coat of his own. "Let us now go to M. Durand\'s the\r\ndraper."\r\n\r\nWhen M. de R\xc3\xaanal came back with the new tutor in his black suit more\r\nthan an hour later, he found his wife still seated in the same place.\r\nShe felt calmed by Julien\'s presence. When she examined him she forgot\r\nto be frightened of him. Julien was not thinking about her at all. In\r\nspite of all his distrust of destiny and mankind, his soul at this\r\nmoment was as simple as that of a child. It seemed as though he had\r\nlived through years since the moment, three hours ago, when he had been\r\nall atremble in the church. He noticed Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s frigid manner\r\nand realised that she was very angry, because he had dared to kiss her\r\nhand. But the proud consciousness which was given to him by the feel\r\nof clothes so different from those which he usually wore, transported\r\nhim so violently and he had so great a desire to conceal his\r\nexultation, that all his movements were marked by a certain spasmodic\r\nirresponsibility. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal looked at him with astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal to him, "dignity above all is necessary if\r\nyou wish to be respected by my children."\r\n\r\n"Sir," answered Julien, "I feel awkward in my new clothes. I am a poor\r\npeasant and have never wore anything but jackets. If you allow it, I\r\nwill retire to my room."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of this \'acquisition?\'" said M. de R\xc3\xaanal to his wife.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal concealed the truth from her husband, obeying an almost\r\ninstinctive impulse which she certainly did not own to herself.\r\n\r\n"I am not as fascinated as you are by this little peasant. Your favours\r\nwill result in his not being able to keep his place, and you will have\r\nto send him back before the month is out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well! we\'ll send him back then, he cannot run me into more than\r\na hundred francs, and Verri\xc3\xa8res will have got used to seeing M. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal\'s children with a tutor. That result would not have been achieved\r\nif I had allowed Julien to wear a workman\'s clothes. If I do send him\r\nback, I shall of course keep the complete black suit which I have just\r\nordered at the draper\'s. All he will keep is the ready-made suit which\r\nI have just put him into at the the tailor\'s."\r\n\r\nThe hour that Julien spent in his room seemed only a minute to Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal. The children who had been told about their new tutor began\r\nto overwhelm their mother with questions. Eventually Julien appeared.\r\nHe was quite another man. It would be incorrect to say that he was\r\ngrave--he was the very incarnation of gravity. He was introduced to\r\nthe children and spoke to them in a manner that astonished M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"I am here, gentlemen, he said, as he finished his speech, to teach\r\nyou Latin. You know what it means to recite a lesson. Here is the Holy\r\nBible, he said, showing them a small volume in thirty-two mo., bound in\r\nblack. It deals especially with the history of our Lord Jesus Christ\r\nand is the part which is called the New Testament. I shall often make\r\nyou recite your lesson, but do you make me now recite mine."\r\n\r\nAdolphe, the eldest of the children, had taken up the book. "Open it\r\nanywhere you like," went on Julien and tell me the first word of any\r\nverse, "I will then recite by heart that sacred book which governs our\r\nconduct towards the whole world, until you stop me."\r\n\r\nAdolphe opened the book and read a word, and Julien recited the whole\r\nof the page as easily as though he had been talking French. M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nlooked at his wife with an air of triumph The children, seeing the\r\nastonishment of their parents, opened their eyes wide. A servant came\r\nto the door of the drawing-room; Julien went on talking Latin. The\r\nservant first remained motionless, and then disappeared. Soon Madame\'s\r\nhouse-maid, together with the cook, arrived at the door. Adolphe had\r\nalready opened the book at eight different places, while Julien went\r\non reciting all the time with the same facility. "Great heavens!" said\r\nthe cook, a good and devout girl, quite aloud, "what a pretty little\r\npriest!" M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s self-esteem became uneasy. Instead of thinking\r\nof examining the tutor, his mind was concentrated in racking his memory\r\nfor some other Latin words. Eventually he managed to spout a phrase of\r\nHorace. Julien knew no other Latin except his Bible. He answered with a\r\nfrown. "The holy ministry to which I destine myself has forbidden me to\r\nread so profane a poet."\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal quoted quite a large number of alleged verses from Horace.\r\nHe explained to his children who Horace was, but the admiring children,\r\nscarcely attended to what he was saying: they were looking at Julien.\r\n\r\nThe servants were still at the door. Julien thought that he ought to\r\nprolong the test--"M. Stanislas-Xavier also," he said to the youngest\r\nof the children, "must give me a passage from the holy book."\r\n\r\nLittle Stanislas, who was quite flattered, read indifferently the first\r\nword of a verse, and Julien said the whole page.\r\n\r\nTo put the finishing touch on M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s triumph, M. Valenod, the\r\nowner of the fine Norman horses, and M. Charcot de Maugiron, the\r\nsub-prefect of the district came in when Julien was reciting. This\r\nscene earned for Julien the title of Monsieur; even the servants did\r\nnot dare to refuse it to him.\r\n\r\nThat evening all Verri\xc3\xa8res flocked to M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s to see the prodigy.\r\nJulien answered everybody in a gloomy manner and kept his own distance.\r\nHis fame spread so rapidly in the town that a few hours afterwards\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal, fearing that he would be taken away by somebody else,\r\nproposed to that he should sign an engagement for two years.\r\n\r\n"No, Monsieur," Julien answered coldly, "if you wished to dismiss me, I\r\nshould have to go. An engagement which binds me without involving you\r\nin any obligation is not an equal one and I refuse it."\r\n\r\nJulien played his cards so well, that in less than a month of his\r\narrival at the house, M. de R\xc3\xaanal himself respected him. As the cur\xc3\xa9\r\nhad quarrelled with both M. de R\xc3\xaanal and M. Valenod, there was no one\r\nwho could betray Julien\'s old passion for Napoleon. He always spoke of\r\nNapoleon with abhorrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTIVE AFFINITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n        They only manage to touch the heart by wounding it.--_A\r\n        Modern_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children adored him, but he did not like them in the least. His\r\nthoughts were elsewhere. But nothing which the little brats ever did\r\nmade him lose his patience. Cold, just and impassive, and none the less\r\nliked, inasmuch his arrival had more or less driven ennui out of the\r\nhouse, he was a good tutor. As for himself, he felt nothing but hate\r\nand abhorrence for that good society into which he had been admitted;\r\nadmitted, it is true at the bottom of the table, a circumstance which\r\nperhaps explained his hate and his abhorrence. There were certain\r\n\'full-dress\' dinners at which he was scarcely able to control his\r\nhate for everything that surrounded him. One St. Louis feast day in\r\nparticular, when M. Valenod was monopolizing the conversation of M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal, Julien was on the point of betraying himself. He escaped\r\ninto the garden on the pretext of finding the children. "What praise\r\nof honesty," he exclaimed. "One would say that was the only virtue,\r\nand yet think how they respect and grovel before a man who has almost\r\ndoubled and trebled his fortune since he has administered the poor\r\nfund. I would bet anything that he makes a profit even out of the\r\nmonies which are intended for the foundlings of these poor creatures\r\nwhose misery is even more sacred than that of others. Oh, Monsters!\r\nMonsters! And I too, am a kind of foundling, hated as I am by my\r\nfather, my brothers, and all my family."\r\n\r\nSome days before the feast of St. Louis, when Julien was taking a\r\nsolitary walk and reciting his breviary in the little wood called\r\nthe Belvedere, which dominates the _Cours de la Fid\xc3\xa9lit\xc3\xa9_, he had\r\nendeavoured in vain to avoid his two brothers whom he saw coming along\r\nin the distance by a lonely path. The jealousy of these coarse workmen\r\nhad been provoked to such a pitch by their brother\'s fine black suit,\r\nby his air of extreme respectability, and by the sincere contempt which\r\nhe had for them, that they had beaten him until he had fainted and was\r\nbleeding all over.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal, who was taking a walk with M. de R\xc3\xaanal and the\r\nsub-prefect, happened to arrive in the little wood. She saw Julien\r\nlying on the ground and thought that he was dead. She was so overcome\r\nthat she made M. Valenod jealous.\r\n\r\nHis alarm was premature. Julien found Madame de R\xc3\xaanal very pretty, but\r\nhe hated her on account of her beauty, for that had been the first\r\ndanger which had almost stopped his career.\r\n\r\nHe talked to her as little as possible, in order to make her forget the\r\ntransport which had induced him to kiss her hand on the first day.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s housemaid, Elisa, had lost no time in falling\r\nin love with the young tutor. She often talked about him to her\r\nmistress. Elisa\'s love had earned for Julien the hatred of one of the\r\nmen-servants. One day he heard the man saying to Elisa, "You haven\'t\r\na word for me now that this dirty tutor has entered the household."\r\nThe insult was undeserved, but Julien with the instinctive vanity of a\r\npretty boy redoubled his care of his personal appearance. M. Valenod\'s\r\nhate also increased. He said publicly, that it was not becoming for a\r\nyoung abb\xc3\xa9 to be such a fop.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal observed that Julien talked more frequently than usual\r\nto Mademoiselle Elisa. She learnt that the reason of these interviews\r\nwas the poverty of Julien\'s extremely small wardrobe. He had so little\r\nlinen that he was obliged to have it very frequently washed outside the\r\nhouse, and it was in these little matters that Elisa was useful to him.\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was touched by this extreme poverty which she had never\r\nsuspected before. She was anxious to make him presents, but she did not\r\ndare to do so. This inner conflict was the first painful emotion that\r\nJulien had caused her. Till then Julien\'s name had been synonymous with\r\na pure and quite intellectual joy. Tormented by the idea of Julien\'s\r\npoverty, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal spoke to her husband about giving him some\r\nlinen for a present.\r\n\r\n"What nonsense," he answered, "the very idea of giving presents to a\r\nman with whom we are perfectly satisfied and who is a good servant. It\r\nwill only be if he is remiss that we shall have to stimulate his zeal."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal felt humiliated by this way of looking at things,\r\nthough she would never have noticed it in the days before Julien\'s\r\narrival. She never looked at the young abb\xc3\xa9\'s attire, with its\r\ncombination of simplicity and absolute cleanliness, without saying to\r\nherself, "The poor boy, how can he manage?"\r\n\r\nLittle by little, instead of being shocked by all Julien\'s\r\ndeficiencies, she pitied him for them.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was one of those provincial women whom one is apt\r\nto take for fools during the first fortnight of acquaintanceship.\r\nShe had no experience of the world and never bothered to keep up the\r\nconversation. Nature had given her a refined and fastidious soul,\r\nwhile that instinct for happiness which is innate in all human beings\r\ncaused her, as a rule, to pay no attention to the acts of the coarse\r\npersons in whose midst chance had thrown her. If she had received the\r\nslightest education, she would have been noticeable for the spontaneity\r\nand vivacity of her mind, but being an heiress, she had been brought\r\nup in a Convent of Nuns, who were passionate devotees of the _Sacred\r\nHeart of Jesus_ and animated by a violent hate for the French as being\r\nthe enemies of the Jesuits. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had had enough sense to\r\nforget quickly all the nonsense which she had learned at the convent,\r\nbut had substituted nothing for it, and in the long run knew nothing.\r\nThe flatteries which had been lavished on her when still a child, by\r\nreason of the great fortune of which she was the heiress, and a decided\r\ntendency to passionate devotion, had given her quite an inner life of\r\nher own. In spite of her pose of perfect affability and her elimination\r\nof her individual will which was cited as a model example by all the\r\nhusbands in Verri\xc3\xa8res and which made M. de R\xc3\xaanal feel very proud, the\r\nmoods of her mind were usually dictated by a spirit of the most haughty\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nMany a princess who has become a bye-word for pride has given\r\ninfinitely more attention to what her courtiers have been doing around\r\nher than did this apparently gentle and demure woman to anything which\r\nher husband either said or did. Up to the time of Julien\'s arrival she\r\nhad never really troubled about anything except her children. Their\r\nlittle maladies, their troubles, their little joys, occupied all the\r\nsensibility of that soul, who, during her whole life, had adored no one\r\nbut God, when she had been at the Sacred Heart of Besan\xc3\xa7on.\r\n\r\nA feverish attack of one of her sons would affect her almost as deeply\r\nas if the child had died, though she would not deign to confide\r\nin anyone. A burst of coarse laughter, a shrug of the shoulders,\r\naccompanied by some platitude on the folly of women, had been the only\r\nwelcome her husband had vouchsafed to those confidences about her\r\ntroubles, which the need of unburdening herself had induced her to make\r\nduring the first years of their marriage. Jokes of this kind, and above\r\nall, when they were directed at her children\'s ailments, were exquisite\r\ntorture to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. And these jokes were all she found to take\r\nthe place of those exaggerated sugary flatteries with which she had\r\nbeen regaled at the Jesuit Convent where she had passed her youth. Her\r\neducation had been given her by suffering. Too proud even to talk to\r\nher friend, Madame Derville, about troubles of this kind, she imagined\r\nthat all men were like her husband, M. Valenod, and the sub-prefect,\r\nM. Charcot de Maugiron. Coarseness, and the most brutal callousness to\r\neverything except financial gain, precedence, or orders, together with\r\nblind hate of every argument to which they objected, seemed to her as\r\nnatural to the male sex as wearing boots and felt hats.\r\n\r\nAfter many years, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had still failed to acclimatize\r\nherself to those monied people in whose society she had to live.\r\n\r\nHence the success of the little peasant Julien. She found in the\r\nsympathy of this proud and noble soul a sweet enjoyment which had all\r\nthe glamour and fascination of novelty.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal soon forgave him that extreme ignorance, which\r\nconstituted but an additional charm, and the roughness of his manner\r\nwhich she succeeded in correcting. She thought that he was worth\r\nlistening to, even when the conversation turned on the most ordinary\r\nevents, even in fact when it was only a question of a poor dog which\r\nhad been crushed as he crossed the street by a peasant\'s cart going\r\nat a trot. The sight of the dog\'s pain made her husband indulge in\r\nhis coarse laugh, while she noticed Julien frown, with his fine black\r\neyebrows which were so beautifully arched.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, it seemed to her that generosity, nobility of soul\r\nand humanity were to be found in nobody else except this young abb\xc3\xa9.\r\nShe felt for him all the sympathy and even all the admiration which\r\nthose virtues excite in well-born souls.\r\n\r\nIf the scene had been Paris, Julien\'s position towards Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nwould have been soon simplified. But at Paris, love is a creature of\r\nnovels. The young tutor and his timid mistress would soon have found\r\nthe elucidation of their position in three or four novels, and even\r\nin the couplets of the Gymnase Theatre. The novels which have traced\r\nout for them the part they would play, and showed them the model which\r\nthey were to imitate, and Julien would sooner or later have been forced\r\nby his vanity to follow that model, even though it had given him no\r\npleasure and had perhaps actually gone against the grain.\r\n\r\nIf the scene had been laid in a small town in Aveyron or the Pyrenees,\r\nthe slightest episode would have been rendered crucial by the fiery\r\ncondition of the atmosphere. But under our more gloomy skies, a poor\r\nyoung man who is only ambitious because his natural refinement makes\r\nhim feel the necessity of some of those joys which only money can give,\r\ncan see every day a woman of thirty who is sincerely virtuous, is\r\nabsorbed in her children, and never goes to novels for her examples of\r\nconduct. Everything goes slowly, everything happens gradually, in the\r\nprovinces where there is far more naturalness.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was often overcome to the point of tears when she\r\nthought of the young tutor\'s poverty. Julien surprised her one day\r\nactually crying.\r\n\r\n"Oh Madame! has any misfortune happened to you?"\r\n\r\n"No, my friend," she answered, "call the children, let us go for a\r\nwalk."\r\n\r\nShe took his arm and leant on it in a manner that struck Julien as\r\nsingular. It was the first time she had called Julien "My friend."\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the walk, Julien noticed that she was blushing\r\nviolently. She slackened her pace.\r\n\r\n"You have no doubt heard," she said, without looking at him, "that I\r\nam the only heiress of a very rich aunt who lives at Besan\xc3\xa7on. She\r\nloads me with presents.... My sons are getting on so wonderfully that\r\nI should like to ask you to accept a small present as a token of my\r\ngratitude. It is only a matter of a few louis to enable you to get\r\nsome linen. But--" she added, blushing still more, and she left off\r\nspeaking--\r\n\r\n"But what, Madame?" said Julien.\r\n\r\n"It is unnecessary," she went on lowering her head, "to mention this to\r\nmy husband."\r\n\r\n"I may not be big, Madame, but I am not mean," answered Julien,\r\nstopping, and drawing himself up to his full height, with his\r\neyes shining with rage, "and this is what you have not realised\r\nsufficiently. I should be lower than a menial if I were to put myself\r\nin the position of concealing from M de. R\xc3\xaanal anything at all having\r\nto do with my money."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was thunderstruck.\r\n\r\n"The Mayor," went on Julien, "has given me on five occasions sums of\r\nthirty-six francs since I have been living in his house. I am ready\r\nto show any account-book to M. de R\xc3\xaanal and anyone else, even to M.\r\nValenod who hates me."\r\n\r\nAs the result of this outburst, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal remained pale and\r\nnervous, and the walk ended without either one or the other finding any\r\npretext for renewing the conversation. Julien\'s proud heart had found\r\nit more and more impossible to love Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nAs for her, she respected him, she admired him, and she had been\r\nscolded by him. Under the pretext of making up for the involuntary\r\nhumiliation which she had caused him, she indulged in acts of the most\r\ntender solicitude. The novelty of these attentions made Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal happy for eight days. Their effect was to appease to some extent\r\nJulien\'s anger. He was far from seeing anything in them in the nature\r\nof a fancy for himself personally.\r\n\r\n"That is just what rich people are," he said to himself--"they snub you\r\nand then they think they can make up for everything by a few monkey\r\ntricks."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s heart was too full, and at the same time too\r\ninnocent, for her not too tell her husband, in spite of her resolutions\r\nnot to do so, about the offer she had made to Julien, and the manner in\r\nwhich she had been rebuffed.\r\n\r\n"How on earth," answered M. de R\xc3\xaanal, keenly piqued, "could you put\r\nup with a refusal on the part of a servant,"--and, when Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal protested against the word "Servant," "I am using, madam, the\r\nwords of the late Prince of Cond\xc3\xa9, when he presented his Chamberlains\r\nto his new wife. \'All these people\' he said \'are servants.\' I have\r\nalso read you this passage from the Memoirs of Besenval, a book which\r\nis indispensable on all questions of etiquette. \'Every person, not\r\na gentleman, who lives in your house and receives a salary is your\r\nservant.\' I\'ll go and say a few words to M. Julien and give him a\r\nhundred francs."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear," said Madame De R\xc3\xaanal trembling, "I hope you won\'t do it\r\nbefore the servants!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, they might be jealous and rightly so," said her husband as he\r\ntook his leave, thinking of the greatness of the sum.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal fell on a chair almost fainting in her anguish. He is\r\ngoing to humiliate Julien, and it is my fault! She felt an abhorrence\r\nfor her husband and hid her face in her hands. She resolved that\r\nhenceforth she would never make any more confidences.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw Julien again she was trembling all over. Her chest was so\r\ncramped that she could not succeed in pronouncing a single word. In her\r\nembarrassment she took his hands and pressed them.\r\n\r\n"Well, my friend," she said to him at last, "are you satisfied with my\r\nhusband?"\r\n\r\n"How could I be otherwise," answered Julien, with a bitter smile, "he\r\nhas given me a hundred francs."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal looked at him doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"Give me your arm," she said at last, with a courageous intonation that\r\nJulien had not heard before.\r\n\r\nShe dared to go as far as the shop of the bookseller of Verri\xc3\xa8res, in\r\nspite of his awful reputation for Liberalism. In the shop she chose\r\nten louis worth of books for a present for her sons. But these books\r\nwere those which she knew Julien was wanting. She insisted on each\r\nchild writing his name then and there in the bookseller\'s shop in\r\nthose books which fell to his lot. While Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was rejoicing\r\nover the kind reparation which she had had the courage to make to\r\nJulien, the latter was overwhelmed with astonishment at the quantity\r\nof books which he saw at the bookseller\'s. He had never dared to enter\r\nso profane a place. His heart was palpitating. Instead of trying to\r\nguess what was passing in Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s heart he pondered deeply\r\nover the means by which a young theological student could procure\r\nsome of those books. Eventually it occurred to him that it would be\r\npossible, with tact, to persuade M. de R\xc3\xaanal that one of the proper\r\nsubjects of his sons\' curriculum would be the history of the celebrated\r\ngentlemen who had been born in the province. After a month of careful\r\npreparation Julien witnessed the success of this idea. The success was\r\nso great that he actually dared to risk mentioning to M. de R\xc3\xaanal in\r\nconversation, a matter which the noble mayor found disagreeable from\r\nquite another point of view. The suggestion was to contribute to the\r\nfortune of a Liberal by taking a subscription at the bookseller\'s. M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal agreed that it would be wise to give his elder son a first\r\nhand acquaintance with many works which he would hear mentioned in\r\nconversation when he went to the Military School.\r\n\r\nBut Julien saw that the mayor had determined to go no further. He\r\nsuspected some secret reason but could not guess it.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking, sir," he said to him one day, "that it would be highly\r\nundesirable for the name of so good a gentleman as a R\xc3\xaanal to appear on\r\na bookseller\'s dirty ledger." M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s face cleared.\r\n\r\n"It would also be a black mark," continued Julien in a more humble\r\ntone, "against a poor theology student if it ever leaked out that his\r\nname had been on the ledger of a bookseller who let out books. The\r\nLiberals might go so far as to accuse me of having asked for the most\r\ninfamous books. Who knows if they will not even go so far as to write\r\nthe titles of those perverse volumes after my name?" But Julien was\r\ngetting off the track. He noticed that the Mayor\'s physiognomy was\r\nre-assuming its expression of embarrassment and displeasure. Julien was\r\nsilent. "I have caught my man," he said to himself.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that a few days afterwards the elder of the children\r\nasked Julien, in M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s presence, about a book which had been\r\nadvertised in the _Quotidienne_.\r\n\r\n"In order to prevent the Jacobin Party having the slightest pretext for\r\na score," said the young tutor, "and yet give me the means of answering\r\nM. de Adolphe\'s question, you can make your most menial servant take\r\nout a subscription at the booksellers."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not a bad idea," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal, who was obviously very\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n"You will have to stipulate all the same," said Julien in that solemn\r\nand almost melancholy manner which suits some people so well when they\r\nsee the realization of matters which they have desired for a long time\r\npast, "you will have to stipulate that the servant should not take out\r\nany novels. Those dangerous books, once they got into the house, might\r\ncorrupt Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s maids, and even the servant himself."\r\n\r\n"You are forgetting the political pamphlets," went on M. de R\xc3\xaanal with\r\nan important air. He was anxious to conceal the admiration with which\r\nthe cunning "middle course" devised by his children\'s tutor had filled\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn this way Julien\'s life was made up of a series of little acts of\r\ndiplomacy, and their success gave him far more food for thought than\r\nthe marked manifestation of favouritism which he could have read at any\r\ntime in Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s heart, had he so wished.\r\n\r\nThe psychological position in which he had found himself all his\r\nlife was renewed again in the mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res\' house. Here in the\r\nsame way as at his father\'s saw-mill, he deeply despised the people\r\nwith whom he lived, and was hated by them. He saw every day in the\r\nconversation of the sub-perfect, M. Valenod and the other friends of\r\nthe family, about things which had just taken place under their very\r\neyes, how little ideas corresponded to reality. If an action seemed to\r\nJulien worthy of admiration, it was precisely that very action which\r\nwould bring down upon itself the censure of the people with whom he\r\nlived. His inner mental reply always was, "What beasts or what fools!"\r\nThe joke was that, in spite of all his pride, he often understood\r\nabsolutely nothing what they were talking about.\r\n\r\nThroughout his whole life he had only spoken sincerely to the old\r\nSurgeon-Major.\r\n\r\nThe few ideas he had were about Buonaparte\'s Italian Campaigns or else\r\nsurgery. His youthful courage revelled in the circumstantial details of\r\nthe most terrible operations. He said to himself.\r\n\r\n"I should not have flinched."\r\n\r\nThe first time that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal tried to enter into conversation\r\nindependently of the children\'s education, he began to talk of surgical\r\noperations. She grew pale and asked him to leave off. Julien knew\r\nnothing beyond that.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that, though he passed his life in Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s\r\ncompany, the most singular silence would reign between them as soon as\r\nthey were alone.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in the salon, she noticed in his eyes, in spite of all the\r\nhumbleness of his demeanour, an air of intellectual superiority towards\r\neveryone who came to visit her. If she found herself alone with him for\r\na single moment, she saw that he was palpably embarrassed. This made\r\nher feel uneasy, for her woman\'s instinct caused her to realise that\r\nthis embarrassment was not inspired by any tenderness.\r\n\r\nOwing to some mysterious idea, derived from some tale of good society,\r\nsuch as the old Surgeon-Major had seen it, Julien felt humiliated\r\nwhenever the conversation languished on any occasion when he found\r\nhimself in a woman\'s society, as though the particular pause were his\r\nown special fault. This sensation was a hundred times more painful in\r\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_. His imagination, full as it was of the most extravagant\r\nand most Spanish ideas of what a man ought to say when he is alone\r\nwith a woman, only suggested to the troubled youth things which were\r\nabsolutely impossible. His soul was in the clouds. Nevertheless he was\r\nunable to emerge from this most humiliating silence. Consequently,\r\nduring his long walks with Madame de R\xc3\xaanal and the children, the\r\nseverity of his manner was accentuated by the poignancy of his\r\nsufferings. He despised himself terribly. If, by any luck, he made\r\nhimself speak, he came out with the most absurd things. To put the\r\nfinishing touch on his misery, he saw his own absurdity and exaggerated\r\nits extent, but what he did not see was the expression in his eyes,\r\nwhich were so beautiful and betokened so ardent a soul, that like good\r\nactors, they sometimes gave charm to something which is really devoid\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal noticed that when he was alone with her he never\r\nchanced to say a good thing except when he was taken out of himself\r\nby some unexpected event, and consequently forgot to try and turn a\r\ncompliment. As the friends of the house did not spoil her by regaling\r\nher with new and brilliant ideas, she enjoyed with delight all the\r\nflashes of Julien\'s intellect.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, every appearance of gallantry has been\r\nseverely exiled from provincial etiquette. People are frightened of\r\nlosing their jobs. All rascals look to the religious order for support,\r\nand hypocrisy has made firm progress even among the Liberal classes.\r\nOne\'s ennui is doubled. The only pleasures left are reading and\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal, the rich heiress of a devout aunt, and married at\r\nsixteen to a respectable gentleman, had never felt or seen in her whole\r\nlife anything that had the slightest resemblance in the whole world\r\nto love. Her confessor, the good cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan, had once mentioned love\r\nto her, in discussing the advances of M. de Valenod, and had drawn so\r\nloathsome a picture of the passion that the word now stood to her for\r\nnothing but the most abject debauchery. She had regarded love, such\r\nas she had come across it, in the very small number of novels with\r\nwhich chance had made her acquainted, as an exception if not indeed as\r\nsomething absolutely abnormal. It was, thanks to this ignorance, that\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal, although incessantly absorbed in Julien, was perfectly\r\nhappy, and never thought of reproaching herself in the slightest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLITTLE EPISODES\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,\r\n    And stolen glances sweeter for the theft,\r\n    And burning blushes, though for no transgression."\r\n                                 _Don Juan_, c. I, st. 74.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only when Madame de R\xc3\xaanal began to think of her maid Elisa\r\nthat there was some slight change in that angelic sweetness which she\r\nowed both to her natural character and her actual happiness. The girl\r\nhad come into a fortune, went to confess herself to the cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan\r\nand confessed to him her plan of marrying Julien. The cur\xc3\xa9 was truly\r\nrejoiced at his friend\'s good fortune, but he was extremely surprised\r\nwhen Julien resolutely informed him that Mademoiselle Elisa\'s offer\r\ncould not suit him.\r\n\r\n"Beware, my friend, of what is passing within your heart," said the\r\ncur\xc3\xa9 with a frown, "I congratulate you on your mission, if that is the\r\nonly reason why you despise a more than ample fortune. It is fifty-six\r\nyears since I was first cur\xc3\xa9 of Verri\xc3\xa8res, and yet I shall be turned\r\nout, according to all appearances. I am distressed by it, and yet my\r\nincome amounts to eight hundred francs. I inform you of this detail so\r\nthat you may not be under any illusions as to what awaits you in your\r\ncareer as a priest. If you think of paying court to the men who enjoy\r\npower, your eternal damnation is assured. You may make your fortune,\r\nbut you will have to do harm to the poor, flatter the sub-prefect,\r\nthe mayor, the man who enjoys prestige, and pander to his passion;\r\nthis conduct, which in the world is called knowledge of life, is not\r\nabsolutely incompatible with salvation so far as a layman is concerned;\r\nbut in our career we have to make a choice; it is a question of making\r\none\'s fortune either in this world or the next; there is no middle\r\ncourse. Come, my dear friend, reflect, and come back in three days with\r\na definite answer. I am pained to detect that there is at the bottom\r\nof your character a sombre passion which is far from indicating to me\r\nthat moderation and that perfect renunciation of earthly advantages so\r\nnecessary for a priest; I augur well of your intellect, but allow me to\r\ntell you," added the good cur\xc3\xa9 with tears in his eyes, "I tremble for\r\nyour salvation in your career as a priest."\r\n\r\nJulien was ashamed of his emotion; he found himself loved for the first\r\ntime in his life; he wept with delight; and went to hide his tears in\r\nthe great woods behind Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\n"Why am I in this position?" he said to himself at last, "I feel that\r\nI would give my life a hundred times over for this good cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan,\r\nand he has just proved to me that I am nothing more than a fool. It\r\nis especially necessary for me to deceive him, and he manages to find\r\nme out. The secret ardour which he refers to is my plan of making my\r\nfortune. He thinks I am unworthy of being a priest, that too, just when\r\nI was imagining that my sacrifice of fifty louis would give him the\r\nvery highest idea of my piety and devotion to my mission."\r\n\r\n"In future," continued Julien, "I will only reckon on those elements in\r\nmy character which I have tested. Who could have told me that I should\r\nfind any pleasure in shedding tears? How I should like some one to\r\nconvince me that I am simply a fool!"\r\n\r\nThree days later, Julien found the excuse with which he ought to have\r\nbeen prepared on the first day; the excuse was a piece of calumny, but\r\nwhat did it matter? He confessed to the cur\xc3\xa9, with a great deal of\r\nhesitation, that he had been persuaded from the suggested union by a\r\nreason he could not explain, inasmuch as it tended to damage a third\r\nparty. This was equivalent to impeaching Elisa\'s conduct. M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan\r\nfound that his manner betrayed a certain worldly fire which was very\r\ndifferent from that which ought to have animated a young acolyte.\r\n\r\n"My friend," he said to him again, "be a good country citizen,\r\nrespected and educated, rather than a priest without a true mission."\r\n\r\nSo far as words were concerned, Julien answered these new remonstrances\r\nvery well. He managed to find the words which a young and ardent\r\nseminarist would have employed, but the tone in which he pronounced\r\nthem, together with the thinly concealed fire which blazed in his eye,\r\nalarmed M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan.\r\n\r\nYou must not have too bad an opinion of Julien\'s prospects. He\r\ninvented with correctness all the words suitable to a prudent and\r\ncunning hypocrisy. It was not bad for his age. As for his tone and his\r\ngestures, he had spent his life with country people; he had never been\r\ngiven an opportunity of seeing great models. Consequently, as soon as\r\nhe was given a chance of getting near such gentlemen, his gestures\r\nbecame as admirable as his words.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was astonished that her maid\'s new fortune did not\r\nmake her more happy. She saw her repeatedly going to the cur\xc3\xa9 and\r\ncoming back with tears in her eyes. At last Elisa talked to her of her\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal thought she was ill. A kind of fever prevented her from\r\nsleeping. She only lived when either her maid or Julien were in sight.\r\nShe was unable to think of anything except them and the happiness\r\nwhich they would find in their home. Her imagination depicted in the\r\nmost fascinating colours the poverty of the little house, where they\r\nwere to live on their income of fifty louis a year. Julien could quite\r\nwell become an advocate at Bray, the sub-prefecture, two leagues from\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res. In that case she would see him sometimes. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nsincerely believed she would go mad. She said so to her husband and\r\nfinally fell ill. That very evening when her maid was attending her,\r\nshe noticed that the girl was crying. She abhorred Elisa at that\r\nmoment, and started to scold her; she then begged her pardon. Elisa\'s\r\ntears redoubled. She said if her mistress would allow her, she would\r\ntell her all her unhappiness.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," answered Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"Well, Madame, he refuses me, some wicked people must have spoken badly\r\nabout me. He believes them."\r\n\r\n"Who refuses you?" said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, scarcely breathing.\r\n\r\n"Who else, Madame, but M. Julien," answered the maid sobbing. "M. the\r\ncur\xc3\xa9 had been unable to overcome his resistance, for M. the cur\xc3\xa9 thinks\r\nthat he ought not to refuse an honest girl on the pretext that she\r\nhas been a maid. After all, M. Julien\'s father is nothing more than\r\na carpenter, and how did he himself earn his living before he was at\r\nMadame\'s?"\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal stopped listening; her excessive happiness had almost\r\ndeprived her of her reason. She made the girl repeat several times\r\nthe assurance that Julien had refused her, with a positiveness which\r\nshut the door on the possibility of his coming round to a more prudent\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n"I will make a last attempt," she said to her maid. "I will speak to M.\r\nJulien."\r\n\r\nThe following day, after breakfast, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal indulged in the\r\ndelightful luxury of pleading her rival\'s cause, and of seeing Elisa\'s\r\nhand and fortune stubbornly refused for a whole hour.\r\n\r\nJulien gradually emerged from his cautiously worded answers, and\r\nfinished by answering with spirit Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s good advice. She\r\ncould not help being overcome by the torrent of happiness which, after\r\nso many days of despair, now inundated her soul. She felt quite ill.\r\nWhen she had recovered and was comfortably in her own room she sent\r\neveryone away. She was profoundly astonished.\r\n\r\n"Can I be in love with Julien?" she finally said to herself. This\r\ndiscovery, which at any other time would have plunged her into remorse\r\nand the deepest agitation, now only produced the effect of a singular,\r\nbut as it were, indifferent spectacle. Her soul was exhausted by all\r\nthat she had just gone through, and had no more sensibility to passion\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal tried to work, and fell into a deep sleep; when she\r\nwoke up she did not frighten herself so much as she ought to have. She\r\nwas too happy to be able to see anything wrong in anything. Na\xc3\xafve and\r\ninnocent as she was, this worthy provincial woman had never tortured\r\nher soul in her endeavours to extract from it a little sensibility to\r\nsome new shade of sentiment or unhappiness. Entirely absorbed as she\r\nhad been before Julien\'s arrival with that mass of work which falls\r\nto the lot of a good mistress of a household away from Paris, Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal thought of passion in the same way in which we think of a\r\nlottery: a certain deception, a happiness sought after by fools.\r\n\r\nThe dinner bell rang. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal blushed violently. She heard the\r\nvoice of Julien who was bringing in the children. Having grown somewhat\r\nadroit since her falling in love, she complained of an awful headache\r\nin order to explain her redness.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just like what all women are," answered M. de R\xc3\xaanal with a\r\ncoarse laugh. "Those machines have always got something or other to be\r\nput right."\r\n\r\nAlthough she was accustomed to this type of wit, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was\r\nshocked by the tone of voice. In order to distract herself, she looked\r\nat Julien\'s physiognomy; he would have pleased her at this particular\r\nmoment, even if he had been the ugliest man imaginable.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal, who always made a point of copying the habits of the\r\ngentry of the court, established himself at Vergy in the first fine\r\ndays of the spring; this is the village rendered celebrated by the\r\ntragic adventure of Gabrielle. A hundred paces from the picturesque\r\nruin of the old Gothic church, M. de R\xc3\xaanal owns an old ch\xc3\xa2teau with its\r\nfour towers and a garden designed like the one in the Tuileries with\r\na great many edging verges of box and avenues of chestnut trees which\r\nare cut twice in the year. An adjacent field, crowded with apple trees,\r\nserved for a promenade. Eight or ten magnificent walnut trees were at\r\nthe end of the orchard. Their immense foliage went as high as perhaps\r\neighty feet.\r\n\r\n"Each of these cursed walnut trees," M. de R\xc3\xaanal was in the habit of\r\nsaying, whenever his wife admired them, "costs me the harvest of at\r\nleast half an acre; corn cannot grow under their shade."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal found the sight of the country novel: her admiration\r\nreached the point of enthusiasm. The sentiment by which she was\r\nanimated gave her both ideas and resolution. M. de R\xc3\xaanal had returned\r\nto the town, for mayoral business, two days after their arrival in\r\nVergy. But Madame de R\xc3\xaanal engaged workmen at her own expense. Julien\r\nhad given her the idea of a little sanded path which was to go round\r\nthe orchard and under the big walnut trees, and render it possible\r\nfor the children to take their walk in the very earliest hours of the\r\nmorning without getting their feet wet from the dew. This idea was put\r\ninto execution within twenty-four hours of its being conceived. Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal gaily spent the whole day with Julien in supervising the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res came back from the town he was very\r\nsurprised to find the avenue completed. His arrival surprised Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal as well. She had forgotten his existence. For two months\r\nhe talked with irritation about the boldness involved in making so\r\nimportant a repair without consulting him, but Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had had\r\nit executed at her own expense, a fact which somewhat consoled him.\r\n\r\nShe spent her days in running about the orchard with her children,\r\nand in catching butterflies. They had made big hoods of clear gauze\r\nwith which they caught the poor _lepidoptera_. This is the barbarous\r\nname which Julien taught Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. For she had had M. Godart\'s\r\nfine work ordered from Besan\xc3\xa7on, and Julien used to tell her about the\r\nstrange habits of the creatures.\r\n\r\nThey ruthlessly transfixed them by means of pins in a great cardboard\r\nbox which Julien had prepared.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal and Julien had at last a topic of conversation; he was\r\nno longer exposed to the awful torture that had been occasioned by\r\ntheir moments of silence.\r\n\r\nThey talked incessantly and with extreme interest, though always about\r\nvery innocent matters. This gay, full, active life, pleased the fancy\r\nof everyone, except Mademoiselle Elisa who found herself overworked.\r\nMadame had never taken so much trouble with her dress, even at carnival\r\ntime, when there is a ball at Verri\xc3\xa8res, she would say; she changes her\r\ngowns two or three times a day.\r\n\r\nAs it is not our intention to flatter anyone, we do not propose to\r\ndeny that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, who had a superb skin, arranged her gowns\r\nin such a way as to leave her arms and her bosom very exposed. She was\r\nextremely well made, and this style of dress suited her delightfully.\r\n\r\n"You have never been _so young_, Madame," her Verri\xc3\xa8res friends would\r\nsay to her, when they came to dinner at Vergy (this is one of the local\r\nexpressions).\r\n\r\nIt is a singular thing, and one which few amongst us will believe, but\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal had no specific object in taking so much trouble. She\r\nfound pleasure in it and spent all the time which she did not pass in\r\nhunting butterflies with the children and Julien, in working with Elisa\r\nat making gowns, without giving the matter a further thought. Her only\r\nexpedition to Verri\xc3\xa8res was caused by her desire to buy some new summer\r\ngowns which had just come from Mulhouse.\r\n\r\nShe brought back to Vergy a young woman who was a relative of hers.\r\nSince her marriage, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had gradually become attached to\r\nMadame Derville, who had once been her school mate at the _Sacr\xc3\xa9 C\xc5\x93ur_.\r\n\r\nMadame Derville laughed a great deal at what she called her cousin\'s\r\nmad ideas: "I would never have thought of them alone," she said. When\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was with her husband, she was ashamed of those sudden\r\nideas, which, are called sallies in Paris, and thought them quite\r\nsilly: but Madame Derville\'s presence gave her courage. She would start\r\nto telling her her thoughts in a timid voice, but after the ladies\r\nhad been alone for a long time, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s brain became more\r\nanimated, and a long morning spent together by the two friends passed\r\nlike a second, and left them in the best of spirits. On this particular\r\njourney, however, the acute Madame Derville thought her cousin much\r\nless merry, but much more happy than usual.\r\n\r\nJulien, on his side, had since coming to the country lived like an\r\nabsolute child, and been as happy as his pupils in running after\r\nthe butterflies. After so long a period of constraint and wary\r\ndiplomacy, he was at last alone and far from human observation; he\r\nwas instinctively free from any apprehension on the score of Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal, and abandoned himself to the sheer pleasure of being alive,\r\nwhich is so keen at so young an age, especially among the most\r\nbeautiful mountains in the world.\r\n\r\nEver since Madame Derville\'s arrival, Julien thought that she was his\r\nfriend; he took the first opportunity of showing her the view from the\r\nend of the new avenue, under the walnut tree; as a matter of fact it is\r\nequal, if not superior, to the most wonderful views that Switzerland\r\nand the Italian lakes can offer. If you ascend the steep slope which\r\ncommences some paces from there, you soon arrive at great precipices\r\nfringed by oak forests, which almost jut on to the river. It was to the\r\npeaked summits of these rocks that Julien, who was now happy, free, and\r\nking of the household into the bargain, would take the two friends, and\r\nenjoy their admiration these sublime views.\r\n\r\n"To me it\'s like Mozart\'s music," Madame Derville would say.\r\n\r\nThe country around Verri\xc3\xa8res had been spoilt for Julien by the jealousy\r\nof his brothers and the presence of a tyranous and angry father. He\r\nwas free from these bitter memories at Vergy; for the first time in\r\nhis life, he failed to see an enemy. When, as frequently happened, M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal was in town, he ventured to read; soon, instead of reading at\r\nnight time, a procedure, moreover, which involved carefully hiding his\r\nlamp at the bottom of a flower-pot turned upside down, he was able to\r\nindulge in sleep; in the day, however, in the intervals between the\r\nchildren\'s lessons, he would come among these rocks with that book\r\nwhich was the one guide of his conduct and object of his enthusiasm. He\r\nfound in it simultaneously happiness, ecstasy and consolation for his\r\nmoments of discouragement.\r\n\r\nCertain remarks of Napoleon about women, several discussions about the\r\nmerits of the novels which were fashionable in his reign, furnished him\r\nnow for the first time with some ideas which any other young man of his\r\nage would have had for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe dog days arrived. They started the habit of spending the evenings\r\nunder an immense pine tree some yards from the house. The darkness was\r\nprofound. One evening, Julien was speaking and gesticulating, enjoying\r\nto the full the pleasure of being at his best when talking to young\r\nwomen; in one of his gestures, he touched the hand of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nwhich was leaning on the back of one of those chairs of painted wood,\r\nwhich are so frequently to be seen in gardens.\r\n\r\nThe hand was quickly removed, but Julien thought it a point of duty\r\nto secure that that hand should not be removed when he touched it.\r\nThe idea of a duty to be performed and the consciousness of his\r\nstultification, or rather of his social inferiority, if he should fail\r\nin achieving it, immediately banished all pleasure from his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nAN EVENING IN THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n        M. Gu\xc3\xa9rin\'s Dido, a charming sketch!--_Strombeck_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis expression was singular when he saw Madame de R\xc3\xaanal the next\r\nday; he watched her like an enemy with whom he would have to fight a\r\nduel. These looks, which were so different from those of the previous\r\nevening, made Madame de R\xc3\xaanal lose her head; she had been kind to him\r\nand he appeared angry. She could not take her eyes off his.\r\n\r\nMadame Derville\'s presence allowed Julien to devote less time to\r\nconversation, and more time to thinking about what he had in his mind.\r\nHis one object all this day was to fortify himself by reading the\r\ninspired book that gave strength to his soul.\r\n\r\nHe considerably curtailed the children\'s lessons, and when Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal\'s presence had effectually brought him back to the pursuit of his\r\nambition, he decided that she absolutely must allow her hand to rest in\r\nhis that evening.\r\n\r\nThe setting of the sun which brought the crucial moment nearer and\r\nnearer made Julien\'s heart beat in a strange way. Night came. He\r\nnoticed with a joy, which took an immense weight off his heart, that\r\nit was going to be very dark. The sky, which was laden with big clouds\r\nthat had been brought along by a sultry wind, seemed to herald a storm.\r\nThe two friends went for their walk very late. All they did that night\r\nstruck Julien as strange. They were enjoying that hour which seems to\r\ngive certain refined souls an increased pleasure in loving.\r\n\r\nAt last they sat down, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal beside Julien, and Madame\r\nDerville near her friend. Engrossed as he was by the attempt which\r\nhe was going to make, Julien could think of nothing to say. The\r\nconversation languished.\r\n\r\n"Shall I be as nervous and miserable over my first duel?" said Julien\r\nto himself; for he was too suspicious both of himself and of others,\r\nnot to realise his own mental state.\r\n\r\nIn his mortal anguish, he would have preferred any danger whatsoever.\r\nHow many times did he not wish some matter to crop up which would\r\nnecessitate Madame de R\xc3\xaanal going into the house and leaving the\r\ngarden! The violent strain on Julien\'s nerves was too great for his\r\nvoice not to be considerably changed; soon Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s voice\r\nbecame nervous as well, but Julien did not notice it. The awful battle\r\nraging between duty and timidity was too painful, for him to be in a\r\nposition to observe anything outside himself. A quarter to ten had\r\njust struck on the ch\xc3\xa2teau clock without his having ventured anything.\r\nJulien was indignant at his own cowardice, and said to himself, "at\r\nthe exact moment when ten o\'clock strikes, I will perform what I have\r\nresolved to do all through the day, or I will go up to my room and blow\r\nout my brains."\r\n\r\nAfter a final moment of expectation and anxiety, during which Julien\r\nwas rendered almost beside himself by his excessive emotion, ten\r\no\'clock struck from the clock over his head. Each stroke of the fatal\r\nclock reverberated in his bosom, and caused an almost physical pang.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the last stroke of ten was still reverberating, he\r\nstretched out his hand and took Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s, who immediately\r\nwithdrew it. Julien, scarcely knowing what he was doing, seized it\r\nagain. In spite of his own excitement, he could not help being struck\r\nby the icy coldness of the hand which he was taking; he pressed it\r\nconvulsively; a last effort was made to take it away, but in the end\r\nthe hand remained in his.\r\n\r\nHis soul was inundated with happiness, not that he loved Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal, but an awful torture had just ended. He thought it necessary\r\nto say something, to avoid Madame Derville noticing anything. His\r\nvoice was now strong and ringing. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s, on the contrary,\r\nbetrayed so much emotion that her friend thought she was ill, and\r\nsuggested her going in. Julien scented danger, "if Madame de R\xc3\xaanal goes\r\nback to the salon, I shall relapse into the awful state in which I have\r\nbeen all day. I have held the hand far too short a time for it really\r\nto count as the scoring of an actual advantage."\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Madame Derville was repeating her suggestion to\r\ngo back to the salon, Julien squeezed vigorously the hand that was\r\nabandoned to him.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal, who had started to get up, sat down again and said in\r\na faint voice,\r\n\r\n"I feel a little ill, as a matter of fact, but the open air is doing me\r\ngood."\r\n\r\nThese words confirmed Julien\'s happiness, which at the present moment\r\nwas extreme; he spoke, he forgot to pose, and appeared the most\r\ncharming man in the world to the two friends who were listening to him.\r\nNevertheless, there was a slight lack of courage in all this eloquence\r\nwhich had suddenly come upon him. He was mortally afraid that Madame\r\nDerville would get tired of the wind before the storm, which was\r\nbeginning to rise, and want to go back alone into the salon. He would\r\nthen have remained _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. He had had,\r\nalmost by accident that blind courage which is sufficient for action;\r\nbut he felt that it was out of his power to speak the simplest word to\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal. He was certain that, however slight her reproaches\r\nmight be, he would nevertheless be worsted, and that the advantage he\r\nhad just won would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nLuckily for him on this evening, his moving and emphatic speeches found\r\nfavour with Madame Derville, who very often found him as clumsy as a\r\nchild and not at all amusing. As for Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, with her hand in\r\nJulien\'s, she did not have a thought; she simply allowed herself to go\r\non living.\r\n\r\nThe hours spent under this great pine tree, planted by by Charles the\r\nBold according to the local tradition, were a real period of happiness.\r\nShe listened with delight to the soughing of the wind in the thick\r\nfoliage of the pine tree and to the noise of some stray drops which\r\nwere beginning to fall upon the leaves which were lowest down. Julien\r\nfailed to notice one circumstance which, if he had, would have quickly\r\nreassured him; Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, who had been obliged to take away her\r\nhand, because she had got up to help her cousin to pick up a flower-pot\r\nwhich the wind had knocked over at her feet, had scarcely sat down\r\nagain before she gave him her hand with scarcely any difficulty and as\r\nthough it had already been a pre-arranged thing between them.\r\n\r\nMidnight had struck a long time ago; it was at last necessary to leave\r\nthe garden; they separated. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal swept away as she was, by\r\nthe happiness of loving, was so completely ignorant of the world that\r\nshe scarcely reproached herself at all. Her happiness deprived her of\r\nher sleep. A leaden sleep overwhelmed Julien who was mortally fatigued\r\nby the battle which timidity and pride had waged in his heart all\r\nthrough the day.\r\n\r\nHe was called at five o\'clock on the following day and scarcely gave\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal a single thought.\r\n\r\nHe had accomplished his duty, and a heroic duty too. The consciousness\r\nof this filled him with happiness; he locked himself in his room, and\r\nabandoned himself with quite a new pleasure to reading exploits of his\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nWhen the breakfast bell sounded, the reading of the Bulletins of the\r\nGreat Army had made him forget all his advantages of the previous day.\r\nHe said to himself flippantly, as he went down to the salon, "I must\r\ntell that woman that I am in love with her." Instead of those looks\r\nbrimful of pleasure which he was expecting to meet, he found the stern\r\nvisage of M. de R\xc3\xaanal, who had arrived from Verri\xc3\xa8res two hours ago,\r\nand did not conceal his dissatisfaction at Julien\'s having passed the\r\nwhole morning without attending to the children. Nothing could have\r\nbeen more sordid than this self-important man when he was in a bad\r\ntemper and thought that he could safely show it.\r\n\r\nEach harsh word of her husband pierced Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s heart.\r\n\r\nAs for Julien, he was so plunged in his ecstasy, and still so engrossed\r\nby the great events which had been passing before his eyes for several\r\nhours, that he had some difficulty at first in bringing his attention\r\nsufficiently down to listen to the harsh remarks which M. de R\xc3\xaanal was\r\naddressing to him. He said to him at last, rather abruptly,\r\n\r\n"I was ill."\r\n\r\nThe tone of this answer would have stung a much less sensitive man than\r\nthe mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res. He half thought of answering Julien by turning\r\nhim out of the house straight away. He was only restrained by the\r\nmaxim which he had prescribed for himself, of never hurrying unduly in\r\nbusiness matters.\r\n\r\n"The young fool," he said to himself shortly afterwards, "has won a\r\nkind of reputation in my house. That man Valenod may take him into his\r\nfamily, or he may quite well marry Elisa, and in either case, he will\r\nbe able to have the laugh of me in his heart."\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wisdom of these reflections, M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s\r\ndissatisfaction did not fail to vent itself any the less by a string\r\nof coarse insults which gradually irritated Julien. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nwas on the point of bursting into tears. Breakfast was scarcely over,\r\nwhen she asked Julien to give her his arm for a walk. She leaned on him\r\naffectionately. Julien could only answer all that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal said\r\nto him by whispering.\r\n\r\n"_That\'s what rich people are like!_"\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal was walking quite close to them; his presence increased\r\nJulien\'s anger. He suddenly noticed that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was leaning on\r\nhis arm in a manner which was somewhat marked. This horrified him, and\r\nhe pushed her violently away and disengaged his arm.\r\n\r\nLuckily, M. de R\xc3\xaanal did not see this new piece of impertinence; it was\r\nonly noticed by Madame Derville. Her friend burst into tears. M. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal now started to chase away by a shower of stones a little peasant\r\ngirl who had taken a private path crossing a corner of the orchard.\r\n"Monsieur Julien, restrain yourself, I pray you. Remember that we all\r\nhave our moments of temper," said madame Derville rapidly.\r\n\r\nJulien looked at her coldly with eyes in which the most supreme\r\ncontempt was depicted.\r\n\r\nThis look astonished Madame Derville, and it would have surprised\r\nher even more if she had appreciated its real expression; she would\r\nhave read in it something like a vague hope of the most atrocious\r\nvengeance. It is, no doubt, such moments of humiliation which have made\r\nRobespierres.\r\n\r\n"Your Julien is very violent; he frightens me," said Madame Derville to\r\nher friend, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"He is right to be angry," she answered. "What does it matter if\r\nhe does pass a morning without speaking to the children, after the\r\nastonishing progress which he has made them make. One must admit that\r\nmen are very hard."\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life Madame de R\xc3\xaanal experienced a kind\r\nof desire for vengeance against her husband. The extreme hatred of\r\nthe rich by which Julien was animated was on the point of exploding.\r\nLuckily, M. de R\xc3\xaanal called his gardener, and remained occupied\r\nwith him in barring by faggots of thorns the private road through\r\nthe orchard. Julien did not vouchsafe any answer to the kindly\r\nconsideration of which he was the object during all the rest of the\r\nwalk. M. de R\xc3\xaanal had scarcely gone away before the two friends made\r\nthe excuse of being fatigued, and each asked him for an arm.\r\n\r\nWalking as he did between these two women whose extreme nervousness\r\nfilled their cheeks with a blushing embarrassment, the haughty pallor\r\nand sombre, resolute air of Julien formed a strange contrast. He\r\ndespised these women and all tender sentiments.\r\n\r\n"What!" he said to himself, "not even an income of five hundred francs\r\nto finish my studies! Ah! how I should like to send them packing."\r\n\r\nAnd absorbed as he was by these stern ideas, such few courteous words\r\nof his two friends as he deigned to take the trouble to understand,\r\ndispleased him as devoid of sense, silly, feeble, in a word--feminine.\r\n\r\nAs the result of speaking for the sake of speaking and of endeavouring\r\nto keep the conversation alive, it came about that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nmentioned that her husband had come from Verri\xc3\xa8res because he had made\r\na bargain for the May straw with one of his farmers. (In this district\r\nit is the May straw with which the bed mattresses are filled).\r\n\r\n"My husband will not rejoin us," added Madame de R\xc3\xaanal; "he will occupy\r\nhimself with finishing the re-stuffing of the house mattresses with\r\nthe help of the gardener and his valet. He has put the May straw this\r\nmorning in all the beds on the first storey; he is now at the second."\r\n\r\nJulien changed colour. He looked at Madame de R\xc3\xaanal in a singular way,\r\nand soon managed somehow to take her on one side, doubling his pace.\r\nMadame Derville allowed them to get ahead.\r\n\r\n"Save my life," said Julien to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal; "only you can do it,\r\nfor you know that the valet hates me desperately. I must confess to\r\nyou, madame, that I have a portrait. I have hidden it in the mattress\r\nof my bed."\r\n\r\nAt these words Madame de R\xc3\xaanal in her turn became pale.\r\n\r\n"Only you, Madame, are able at this moment to go into my room, feel\r\nabout without their noticing in the corner of the mattress; it\r\nis nearest the window. You will find a small, round box of black\r\ncardboard, very glossy."\r\n\r\n"Does it contain a portrait?" said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, scarcely able to\r\nhold herself upright.\r\n\r\nJulien noticed her air of discouragement, and at once proceeded to\r\nexploit it.\r\n\r\n"I have a second favour to ask you, madame. I entreat you not to look\r\nat that portrait; it is my secret."\r\n\r\n"It is a secret," repeated Madame de R\xc3\xaanal in a faint voice.\r\n\r\nBut though she had been brought up among people who are proud of their\r\nfortune and appreciative of nothing except money, love had already\r\ninstilled generosity into her soul. Truly wounded as she was, it was\r\nwith an air of the most simple devotion that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal asked\r\nJulien the questions necessary to enable her to fulfil her commission.\r\n\r\n"So" she said to him as she went away, "it is a little round box of\r\nblack cardboard, very glossy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Madame," answered Julien, with that hardness which danger gives\r\nto men.\r\n\r\nShe ascended the second storey of the ch\xc3\xa2teau as pale as though she had\r\nbeen going to her death. Her misery was completed by the sensation that\r\nshe was on the verge of falling ill, but the necessity of doing Julien\r\na service restored her strength.\r\n\r\n"I must have that box," she said to herself, as she doubled her pace.\r\n\r\nShe heard her husband speaking to the valet in Julien\'s very room.\r\nHappily, they passed into the children\'s room. She lifted up the\r\nmattress, and plunged her hand into the stuffing so violently that she\r\nbruised her fingers. But, though she was very sensitive to slight pain\r\nof this kind, she was not conscious of it now, for she felt almost\r\nsimultaneously the smooth surface of the cardboard box. She seized it\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely recovered from the fear of being surprised by her\r\nhusband than the horror with which this box inspired her came within an\r\nace of positively making her feel ill.\r\n\r\n"So Julien is in love, and I hold here the portrait of the woman whom\r\nhe loves!"\r\n\r\nSeated on the chair in the ante-chamber of his apartment, Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal fell a prey to all the horrors of jealousy. Her extreme\r\nignorance, moreover, was useful to her at this juncture; her\r\nastonishment mitigated her grief. Julien seized the box without\r\nthanking her or saying a single word, and ran into his room, where\r\nhe lit a fire and immediately burnt it. He was pale and in a state\r\nof collapse. He exaggerated the extent of the danger which he had\r\nundergone.\r\n\r\n"Finding Napoleon\'s portrait," he said to himself, "in the possession\r\nof a man who professes so great a hate for the usurper! Found, too,\r\nby M. de R\xc3\xaanal, who is so great an _ultra_, and is now in a state of\r\nirritation, and, to complete my imprudence, lines written in my own\r\nhandwriting on the white cardboard behind the portrait, lines, too,\r\nwhich can leave no doubt on the score of my excessive admiration. And\r\neach of these transports of love is dated. There was one the day before\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"All my reputation collapsed and shattered in a moment," said Julien\r\nto himself as he watched the box burn, "and my reputation is my only\r\nasset. It is all I have to live by--and what a life to, by heaven!"\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards, this fatigue, together with the pity which he felt\r\nfor himself made him inclined to be more tender. He met Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nand took her hand, which he kissed with more sincerity than he had\r\never done before. She blushed with happiness and almost simultaneously\r\nrebuffed Julien with all the anger of jealousy. Julien\'s pride which\r\nhad been so recently wounded made him act foolishly at this juncture.\r\nHe saw in Madame de R\xc3\xaanal nothing but a rich woman, he disdainfully let\r\nher hand fall and went away. He went and walked about meditatively in\r\nthe garden. Soon a bitter smile appeared on his lips.\r\n\r\n"Here I am walking about as serenely as a man who is master of his own\r\ntime. I am not bothering about the children! I am exposing myself to M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal\'s humiliating remarks, and he will be quite right." He ran to\r\nthe children\'s room. The caresses of the youngest child, whom he loved\r\nvery much, somewhat calmed his agony.\r\n\r\n"He does not despise me yet," thought Julien. But he soon reproached\r\nhimself for this alleviation of his agony as though it were a new\r\nweakness. The children caress me just in the same way in which they\r\nwould caress the young hunting-hound which was bought yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA GREAT HEART AND A SMALL FORTUNE\r\n\r\n\r\n    But passion most disembles, yet betrays,\r\n    Even by its darkness, as the blackest sky\r\n    Foretells the heaviest tempest.\r\n                           _Don Juan_, c. 4, st. 75.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. De R\xc3\xaanal was going through all the rooms in the ch\xc3\xa2teau, and he came\r\nback into the children\'s room with the servants who were bringing back\r\nthe stuffings of the mattresses. The sudden entry of this man had the\r\neffect on Julien of the drop of water which makes the pot overflow.\r\n\r\nLooking paler and more sinister than usual, he rushed towards him. M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal stopped and looked at his servants.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said Julien to him, "Do you think your children would have\r\nmade the progress they have made with me with any other tutor? If you\r\nanswer \'No,\'" continued Julien so quickly that M. de R\xc3\xaanal did not have\r\ntime to speak, "how dare you reproach me with neglecting them?"\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal, who had scarcely recovered from his fright, concluded from\r\nthe strange tone he saw this little peasant assume, that he had some\r\nadvantageous offer in his pocket, and that he was going to leave him.\r\n\r\nThe more he spoke the more Julien\'s anger increased, "I can live\r\nwithout you, Monsieur," he added.\r\n\r\n"I am really sorry to see you so upset," answered M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nshuddering a little. The servants were ten yards off engaged in making\r\nthe beds.\r\n\r\n"That is not what I mean, Monsieur," replied Julien quite beside\r\nhimself. "Think of the infamous words that you have addressed to me,\r\nand before women too."\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal understood only too well what Julien was asking, and a\r\npainful conflict tore his soul. It happened that Julien, who was really\r\nmad with rage, cried out,\r\n\r\n"I know where to go, Monsieur, when I leave your house."\r\n\r\nAt these words M. de R\xc3\xaanal saw Julien installed with M. Valenod. "Well,\r\nsir," he said at last with a sigh, just as though he had called in\r\na surgeon to perform the most painful operation, "I accede to your\r\nrequest. I will give you fifty francs a month. Starting from the day\r\nafter to-morrow which is the first of the month."\r\n\r\nJulien wanted to laugh, and stood there dumbfounded. All his anger had\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n"I do not despise the brute enough," he said to himself. "I have no\r\ndoubt that that is the greatest apology that so base a soul can make."\r\n\r\nThe children who had listened to this scene with gaping mouths, ran\r\ninto the garden to tell their mother that M. Julien was very angry, but\r\nthat he was going to have fifty francs a month.\r\n\r\nJulien followed them as a matter of habit without even looking at M. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal whom he left in a considerable state of irritation.\r\n\r\n"That makes one hundred and sixty-eight francs," said the mayor to\r\nhimself, "that M. Valenod has cost me. I must absolutely speak a few\r\nstrong words to him about his contract to provide for the foundlings."\r\n\r\nA minute afterwards Julien found himself opposite M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"I want to speak to M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan on a matter of conscience. I have the\r\nhonour to inform you that I shall be absent some hours."\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear Julien," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal smiling with the falsest\r\nexpression possible, "take the whole day, and to-morrow too if you\r\nlike, my good friend. Take the gardener\'s horse to go to Verri\xc3\xa8res."\r\n\r\n"He is on the very point," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal to himself, "of giving an\r\nanswer to Valenod. He has promised me nothing, but I must let this\r\nhot-headed young man have time to cool down."\r\n\r\nJulien quickly went away, and went up into the great forest, through\r\nwhich one can manage to get from Vergy to Verri\xc3\xa8res. He did not wish\r\nto arrive at M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan\'s at once. Far from wishing to cramp himself in\r\na new pose of hypocrisy he needed to see clear in his own soul, and to\r\ngive audience to the crowd of sentiments which were agitating him.\r\n\r\n"I have won a battle," he said to himself, as soon as he saw that he\r\nwas well in the forest, and far from all human gaze. "So I have won a\r\nbattle."\r\n\r\nThis expression shed a rosy light on his situation, and restored him to\r\nsome serenity.\r\n\r\n"Here I am with a salary of fifty francs a month, M. de R\xc3\xaanal must be\r\nprecious afraid, but what of?"\r\n\r\nThis meditation about what could have put fear into the heart of that\r\nhappy, powerful man against whom he had been boiling with rage only\r\nan hour back, completed the restoration to serenity of Julien\'s soul.\r\nHe was almost able to enjoy for a moment the delightful beauty of the\r\nwoods amidst which he was walking. Enormous blocks of bare rocks had\r\nfallen down long ago in the middle of the forest by the mountain side.\r\nGreat cedars towered almost as high as these rocks whose shade caused a\r\ndelicious freshness within three yards of places where the heat of the\r\nsun\'s rays would have made it impossible to rest.\r\n\r\nJulien took breath for a moment in the shade of these great rocks,\r\nand then he began again to climb. Traversing a narrow path that was\r\nscarcely marked, and was only used by the goat herds, he soon found\r\nhimself standing upon an immense rock with the complete certainty of\r\nbeing far away from all mankind. This physical position made him smile.\r\nIt symbolised to him the position he was burning to attain in the moral\r\nsphere. The pure air of these lovely mountains filled his soul with\r\nserenity and even with joy. The mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res still continued to\r\ntypify in his eyes all the wealth and all the arrogance of the earth;\r\nbut Julien felt that the hatred that had just thrilled him had nothing\r\npersonal about it in spite of all the violence which he had manifested.\r\nIf he had left off seeing M. de R\xc3\xaanal he would in eight days have\r\nforgotten him, his castle, his dogs, his children and all his family.\r\n"I forced him, I don\'t know how, to make the greatest sacrifice. What?\r\nmore than fifty crowns a year, and only a minute before I managed to\r\nextricate myself from the greatest danger; so there are two victories\r\nin one day. The second one is devoid of merit, I must find out the why\r\nand the wherefore. But these laborious researches are for to-morrow."\r\n\r\nStanding up on his great rock, Julien looked at the sky which was all\r\nafire with an August sun. The grasshoppers sang in the field about the\r\nrock; when they held their peace there was universal silence around\r\nhim. He saw twenty leagues of country at his feet. He noticed from\r\ntime to time some hawk, which launching off from the great rocks over\r\nhis head was describing in silence its immense circles. Julien\'s eye\r\nfollowed the bird of prey mechanically. Its tranquil powerful movements\r\nstruck him. He envied that strength, that isolation.\r\n\r\n"Would Napoleon\'s destiny be one day his?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAN EVENING\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yet Julia\'s very coldness still was kind,\r\n    And tremulously gently her small hand\r\n    Withdrew itself from his, but left behind\r\n    A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland,\r\n    And slight, so very slight that to the mind,\r\n    \'Twas but a doubt.\r\n                        _Don Juan_, c. I. st, 71.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, however, to put in an appearance at Verri\xc3\xa8res. As\r\nJulien left the cur\xc3\xa9 house he was fortunate enough to meet M. Valenod,\r\nwhom he hastened to tell of the increase in his salary.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Vergy, Julien waited till night had fallen before going\r\ndown into the garden. His soul was fatigued by the great number of\r\nviolent emotions which had agitated him during the day. "What shall I\r\nsay to them?" he reflected anxiously, as he thought about the ladies.\r\nHe was far from realising that his soul was just in a mood to discuss\r\nthose trivial circumstances which usually monopolise all feminine\r\ninterests. Julien was often unintelligible to Madame Derville, and even\r\nto her friend, and he in his turn only half understood all that they\r\nsaid to him. Such was the effect of the force and, if I may venture to\r\nuse such language, the greatness of the transports of passion which\r\noverwhelmed the soul of this ambitious youth. In this singular being it\r\nwas storm nearly every day.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the garden this evening, Julien was inclined to take an\r\ninterest in what the pretty cousins were thinking. They were waiting\r\nfor him impatiently. He took his accustomed seat next to Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal. The darkness soon became profound. He attempted to take hold of\r\na white hand which he had seen some time near him, as it leant on the\r\nback of a chair. Some hesitation was shewn, but eventually the hand was\r\nwithdrawn in a manner which indicated displeasure. Julien was inclined\r\nto give up the attempt as a bad job, and to continue his conversation\r\nquite gaily, when he heard M. de R\xc3\xaanal approaching.\r\n\r\nThe coarse words he had uttered in the morning were still ringing in\r\nJulien\'s ears. "Would not taking possession of his wife\'s hand in his\r\nvery presence," he said to himself, "be a good way of scoring off that\r\ncreature who has all that life can give him. Yes! I will do it. I, the\r\nvery man for whom he has evidenced so great a contempt."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the tranquillity which was so alien to Julien\'s real\r\ncharacter quickly disappeared. He was obsessed by an anxious desire\r\nthat Madame de R\xc3\xaanal should abandon her hand to him.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal was talking politics with vehemence; two or three\r\ncommercial men in Verri\xc3\xa8res had been growing distinctly richer than he\r\nwas, and were going to annoy him over the elections. Madame Derville\r\nwas listening to him. Irritated by these tirades, Julien brought his\r\nchair nearer Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. All his movements were concealed by the\r\ndarkness. He dared to put his hand very near to the pretty arm which\r\nwas left uncovered by the dress. He was troubled and had lost control\r\nof his mind. He brought his face near to that pretty arm and dared to\r\nput his lips on it.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal shuddered. Her husband was four paces away. She\r\nhastened to give her hand to Julien, and at the same time to push him\r\nback a little. As M. de R\xc3\xaanal was continuing his insults against those\r\nne\'er-do-wells and Jacobins who were growing so rich, Julien covered\r\nthe hand which had been abandoned to him with kisses, which were either\r\nreally passionate or at any rate seemed so to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. But\r\nthe poor woman had already had the proofs on that same fatal day that\r\nthe man whom she adored, without owning it to herself, loved another!\r\nDuring the whole time Julien had been absent she had been the prey to\r\nan extreme unhappiness which had made her reflect.\r\n\r\n"What," she said to herself, "Am I going to love, am I going to be in\r\nlove? Am I, a married woman, going to fall in love? But," she said to\r\nherself, "I have never felt for my husband this dark madness, which\r\nnever permits of my keeping Julien out of my thoughts. After all, he\r\nis only a child who is full of respect for me. This madness will be\r\nfleeting. In what way do the sentiments which I may have for this young\r\nman concern my husband? M. de R\xc3\xaanal would be bored by the conversations\r\nwhich I have with Julien on imaginative subjects. As for him, he simply\r\nthinks of his business. I am not taking anything away from him to give\r\nto Julien."\r\n\r\nNo hypocrisy had sullied the purity of that na\xc3\xafve soul, now swept away\r\nby a passion such as it had never felt before. She deceived herself,\r\nbut without knowing it. But none the less, a certain instinct of virtue\r\nwas alarmed. Such were the combats which were agitating her when\r\nJulien appeared in the garden. She heard him speak and almost at the\r\nsame moment she saw him sit down by her side. Her soul was as it were\r\ntransported by this charming happiness which had for the last fortnight\r\nsurprised her even more than it had allured. Everything was novel for\r\nher. None the less, she said to herself after some moments, "the mere\r\npresence of Julien is quite enough to blot out all his wrongs." She was\r\nfrightened; it was then that she took away her hand.\r\n\r\nHis passionate kisses, the like of which she had never received before,\r\nmade her forget that perhaps he loved another woman. Soon he was no\r\nlonger guilty in her eyes. The cessation of that poignant pain which\r\nsuspicion had engendered and the presence of a happiness that she had\r\nnever even dreamt of, gave her ecstasies of love and of mad gaiety.\r\nThe evening was charming for everyone, except the mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res,\r\nwho was unable to forget his _parvenu_ manufacturers. Julien left off\r\nthinking about his black ambition, or about those plans of his which\r\nwere so difficult to accomplish. For the first time in his life he was\r\nled away by the power of beauty. Lost in a sweetly vague reverie, quite\r\nalien to his character, and softly pressing that hand, which he thought\r\nideally pretty, he half listened to the rustle of the leaves of the\r\npine trees, swept by the light night breeze, and to the dogs of the\r\nmill on the Doubs, who barked in the distance.\r\n\r\nBut this emotion was one of pleasure and not passion. As he entered his\r\nroom, he only thought of one happiness, that of taking up again his\r\nfavourite book. When one is twenty the idea of the world and the figure\r\nto be cut in it dominate everything.\r\n\r\nHe soon, however, laid down the book. As the result of thinking of the\r\nvictories of Napoleon, he had seen a new element in his own victory.\r\n"Yes," he said to himself, "I have won a battle. I must exploit it. I\r\nmust crush the pride of that proud gentleman while he is in retreat.\r\nThat would be real Napoleon. I must ask him for three days\' holiday to\r\ngo and see my friend Fouqu\xc3\xa9. If he refuses me I will threaten to give\r\nhim notice, but he will yield the point."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal could not sleep a wink. It seemed as though, until this\r\nmoment, she had never lived. She was unable to distract her thoughts\r\nfrom the happiness of feeling Julian cover her hand with his burning\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the awful word adultery came into her mind. All the\r\nloathesomeness with which the vilest debauchery can invest sensual love\r\npresented itself to her imagination. These ideas essayed to pollute the\r\ndivinely tender image which she was fashioning of Julien, and of the\r\nhappiness of loving him. The future began to be painted in terrible\r\ncolours. She began to regard herself as contemptible.\r\n\r\nThat moment was awful. Her soul was arriving in unknown countries.\r\nDuring the evening she had tasted a novel happiness. Now she found\r\nherself suddenly plunged in an atrocious unhappiness. She had never\r\nhad any idea of such sufferings; they troubled her reason. She thought\r\nfor a moment of confessing to her husband that she was apprehensive\r\nof loving Julien. It would be an opportunity of speaking of him.\r\nFortunately her memory threw up a maxim which her aunt had once given\r\nher on the eve of her marriage. The maxim dealt with the danger of\r\nmaking confidences to a husband, for a husband is after all a master.\r\nShe wrung her hands in the excess of her grief. She was driven this way\r\nand that by clashing and painful ideas. At one moment she feared that\r\nshe was not loved. The next the awful idea of crime tortured her, as\r\nmuch as if she had to be exposed in the pillory on the following day in\r\nthe public square of Verri\xc3\xa8res, with a placard to explain her adultery\r\nto the populace.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal had no experience of life. Even in the full possession\r\nof her faculties, and when fully exercising her reason, she would never\r\nhave appreciated any distinction between being guilty in the eyes of\r\nGod, and finding herself publicly overwhelmed with the crudest marks of\r\nuniversal contempt.\r\n\r\nWhen the awful idea of adultery, and of all the disgrace which in her\r\nview that crime brought in its train, left her some rest, she began to\r\ndream of the sweetness of living innocently with Julien as in the days\r\nthat had gone by.\r\n\r\nShe found herself confronted with the horrible idea that Julien loved\r\nanother woman. She still saw his pallor when he had feared to lose\r\nher portrait, or to compromise her by exposing it to view. For the\r\nfirst time she had caught fear on that tranquil and noble visage. He\r\nhad never shewn such emotion to her or her children. This additional\r\nanguish reached the maximum of unhappiness which the human soul is\r\ncapable of enduring. Unconsciously, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal uttered cries which\r\nwoke up her maid. Suddenly she saw the brightness of a light appear\r\nnear her bed, and recognized Elisa. "Is it you he loves?" she exclaimed\r\nin her delirium.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the maid was so astonished by the terrible trouble in\r\nwhich she found her mistress that she paid no attention to this\r\nsingular expression. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal appreciated her imprudence.\r\n"I have the fever," she said to her, "and I think I am a little\r\ndelirious." Completely woken up by the necessity of controlling\r\nherself, she became less unhappy. Reason regained that supreme control\r\nwhich the semi-somnolent state had taken away. To free herself from her\r\nmaid\'s continual stare, she ordered her maid to read the paper, and\r\nit was as she listened to the monotonous voice of this girl, reading\r\na long article from the _Quotidienne_ that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal made the\r\nvirtuous resolution to treat Julien with absolute coldness when she saw\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\n        Elegant people are to be found in Paris. People of\r\n        character may exist in the provinces.--Si\xc3\xa8yes\r\n\r\n\r\nAt five o\'clock the following day, before Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was visible,\r\nJulien obtained a three days\' holiday from her husband. Contrary to his\r\nexpectation Julien found himself desirous of seeing her again. He kept\r\nthinking of that pretty hand of hers. He went down into the garden, but\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal kept him waiting for a long time. But if Julien had\r\nloved her, he would have seen her forehead glued to the pane behind the\r\nhalf-closed blinds on the first floor. She was looking at him. Finally,\r\nin spite of her resolutions, she decided to go into the garden. Her\r\nhabitual pallor had been succeeded by more lively hues. This woman,\r\nsimple as she was, was manifestly agitated; a sentiment of constraint,\r\nand even of anger, altered that expression of profound serenity which\r\nseemed, as it were, to be above all the vulgar interests of life and\r\ngave so much charm to that divine face.\r\n\r\nJulien approached her with eagerness, admiring those beautiful arms\r\nwhich were just visible through a hastily donned shawl. The freshness\r\nof the morning air seemed to accentuate still more the brilliance of\r\nher complexion which the agitation of the past night rendered all the\r\nmore susceptible to all impressions. This demure and pathetic beauty,\r\nwhich was, at the same time, full of thoughts which are never found in\r\nthe inferior classes, seemed to reveal to Julien a faculty in his own\r\nsoul which he had never before realised. Engrossed in his admiration of\r\nthe charms on which his his greedy gaze was riveted, Julien took for\r\ngranted the friendly welcome which he was expecting to receive. He was\r\nall the more astonished at the icy coldness which she endeavoured to\r\nmanifest to him, and through which he thought he could even distinguish\r\nthe intention of putting him in his place.\r\n\r\nThe smile of pleasure died away from his lips as he remembered his\r\nrank in society, especially from the point of view of a rich and noble\r\nheiress. In a single moment his face exhibited nothing but haughtiness\r\nand anger against himself. He felt violently disgusted that he could\r\nhave put off his departure for more than an hour, simply to receive so\r\nhumiliating a welcome.\r\n\r\n"It is only a fool," he said to himself, "who is angry with others; a\r\nstone falls because it is heavy. Am I going to be a child all my life?\r\nHow on earth is it that I manage to contract the charming habit of\r\nshowing my real self to those people simply in return for their money?\r\nIf I want to win their respect and that of my own self, I must shew\r\nthem that it is simply a business transaction between my poverty and\r\ntheir wealth, but that my heart is a thousand leagues away from their\r\ninsolence, and is situated in too high a sphere to be affected by their\r\npetty marks of favour or disdain."\r\n\r\nWhile these feelings were crowding the soul of the young tutor, his\r\nmobile features assumed an expression of ferocity and injured pride.\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was extremely troubled. The virtuous coldness that she\r\nhad meant to put into her welcome was succeeded by an expression of\r\ninterest--an interest animated by all the surprise brought about by\r\nthe sudden change which she had just seen. The empty morning platitudes\r\nabout their health and the fineness of the day suddenly dried up.\r\nJulien\'s judgment was disturbed by no passion, and he soon found a\r\nmeans of manifesting to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal how light was the friendly\r\nrelationship that he considered existed between them. He said nothing\r\nto her about the little journey that he was going to make; saluted her,\r\nand went away.\r\n\r\nAs she watched him go, she was overwhelmed by the sombre haughtiness\r\nwhich she read in that look which had been so gracious the previous\r\nevening. Her eldest son ran up from the bottom of the garden, and said\r\nas he kissed her,\r\n\r\n"We have a holiday, M. Julien is going on a journey."\r\n\r\nAt these words, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal felt seized by a deadly coldness. She\r\nwas unhappy by reason of her virtue, and even more unhappy by reason of\r\nher weakness.\r\n\r\nThis new event engrossed her imagination, and she was transported far\r\nbeyond the good resolutions which she owed to the awful night she had\r\njust passed. It was not now a question of resisting that charming\r\nlover, but of losing him for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to appear at breakfast. To complete her anguish, M. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal and Madame Derville talked of nothing but Julien\'s departure. The\r\nmayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res had noticed something unusual in the firm tone in\r\nwhich he had asked for a holiday.\r\n\r\n"That little peasant has no doubt got somebody else\'s offer up his\r\nsleeve, but that somebody else, even though it\'s M. Valenod, is bound\r\nto be a little discouraged by the sum of six hundred francs, which the\r\nannual salary now tots up to. He must have asked yesterday at Verri\xc3\xa8res\r\nfor a period of three days to think it over, and our little gentleman\r\nruns off to the mountains this morning so as not to be obliged to give\r\nme an answer. Think of having to reckon with a wretched workman who\r\nputs on airs, but that\'s what we\'ve come to."\r\n\r\n"If my husband, who does not know how deeply he has wounded Julien,\r\nthinks that he will leave us, what can I think myself?" said Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal to herself. "Yes, that is all decided." In order to be able at\r\nany rate to be free to cry, and to avoid answering Madame Derville\'s\r\nquestions, she pleaded an awful headache, and went to bed.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what women are," repeated M. de R\xc3\xaanal, "there is always\r\nsomething out of order in those complicated machines," and he went off\r\njeering.\r\n\r\nWhile Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was a prey to all the poignancy of the terrible\r\npassion in which chance had involved her, Julien went merrily on his\r\nway, surrounded by the most beautiful views that mountain scenery\r\ncan offer. He had to cross the great chain north of Vergy. The path\r\nwhich he followed rose gradually among the big beech woods, and ran\r\ninto infinite spirals on the slope of the high mountain which forms\r\nthe northern boundary of the Doubs valley. Soon the traveller\'s view,\r\nas he passed over the lower slopes bounding the course of the Doubs\r\ntowards the south, extends as far as the fertile plains of Burgundy and\r\nBeaujolais. However insensible was the soul of this ambitious youth to\r\nthis kind of beauty, he could not help stopping from time to time to\r\nlook at a spectacle at once so vast and so impressive.\r\n\r\nFinally, he reached the summit of the great mountain, near which\r\nhe had to pass in order to arrive by this cross-country route at\r\nthe solitary valley where lived his friend Fouqu\xc3\xa9, the young wood\r\nmerchant. Julien was in no hurry to see him; either him, or any other\r\nhuman being. Hidden like a bird of prey amid the bare rocks which\r\ncrowned the great mountain, he could see a long way off anyone coming\r\nnear him. He discovered a little grotto in the middle of the almost\r\nvertical slope of one of the rocks. He found a way to it, and was soon\r\nensconced in this retreat. "Here," he said, "with eyes brilliant with\r\njoy, men cannot hurt me." It occurred to him to indulge in the pleasure\r\nof writing down those thoughts of his which were so dangerous to him\r\neverywhere else. A square stone served him for a desk; his pen flew. He\r\nsaw nothing of what was around him. He noticed at last that the sun was\r\nsetting behind the distant mountains of Beaujolais.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I pass the night here?" he said to himself. "I have\r\nbread, and I am free." He felt a spiritual exultation at the sound of\r\nthat great word. The necessity of playing the hypocrite resulted in his\r\nnot being free, even at Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s. Leaning his head on his two hands,\r\nJulien stayed in the grotto, more happy than he had ever been in his\r\nlife, thrilled by his dreams, and by the bliss of his freedom. Without\r\nrealising it, he saw all the rays of the twilight become successively\r\nextinguished. Surrounded by this immense obscurity, his soul wandered\r\ninto the contemplation of what he imagined that he would one day meet\r\nin Paris. First it was a woman, much more beautiful and possessed of a\r\nmuch more refined temperament than anything he could have found in the\r\nprovinces. He loved with passion, and was loved. If he separated from\r\nher for some instants, it was only to cover himself with glory, and to\r\ndeserve to be loved still more.\r\n\r\nA young man brought up in the environment of the sad truths of Paris\r\nsociety, would, on reaching this point in his romance, even if we\r\nassume him possessed of Julien\'s imagination, have been brought back\r\nto himself by the cold irony of the situation. Great deeds would have\r\ndisappeared from out his ken together with hope of achieving them and\r\nhave been succeeded by the platitude. "If one leave one\'s mistress\r\none runs alas! the risk of being deceived two or three times a day."\r\nBut the young peasant saw nothing but the lack of opportunity between\r\nhimself and the most heroic feats.\r\n\r\nBut a deep night had succeeded the day, and there were still two\r\nleagues to walk before he could descend to the cabin in which Fouqu\xc3\xa9\r\nlived. Before leaving the little cave, Julien made a light and\r\ncarefully burnt all that he had written. He quite astonished his friend\r\nwhen he knocked at his door at one o\'clock in the morning. He found\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 engaged in making up his accounts. He was a young man of high\r\nstature, rather badly made, with big, hard features, a never-ending\r\nnose, and a large fund of good nature concealed beneath this repulsive\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n"Have you quarelled with M. de R\xc3\xaanal then that you turn up unexpectedly\r\nlike this?" Julien told him, but in a suitable way, the events of the\r\nprevious day.\r\n\r\n"Stay with me," said Fouqu\xc3\xa9 to him. "I see that you know M. de R\xc3\xaanal,\r\nM. Valenod, the sub-prefect Maugron, the cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan. You have\r\nunderstood the subtleties of the character of those people. So there\r\nyou are then, quite qualified to attend auctions. You know arithmetic\r\nbetter than I do; you will keep my accounts; I make a lot in my\r\nbusiness. The impossibility of doing everything myself, and the fear\r\nof taking a rascal for my partner prevents me daily from undertaking\r\nexcellent business. It\'s scarcely a month since I put Michaud de\r\nSaint-Amand, whom I haven\'t seen for six years, and whom I ran across\r\nat the sale at Pontarlier in the way of making six thousand francs. Why\r\nshouldn\'t it have been you who made those six thousand francs, or at\r\nany rate three thousand. For if I had had you with me that day, I would\r\nhave raised the bidding for that lot of timber and everybody else would\r\nsoon have run away. Be my partner."\r\n\r\nThis offer upset Julien. It spoilt the train of his mad dreams. Fouqu\xc3\xa9\r\nshowed his accounts to Julien during the whole of the supper--which the\r\ntwo friends prepared themselves like the Homeric heroes (for Fouqu\xc3\xa9\r\nlived alone) and proved to him all the advantages offered by his timber\r\nbusiness. Fouqu\xc3\xa9 had the highest opinion of the gifts and character of\r\nJulien.\r\n\r\nWhen, finally, the latter was alone in his little room of pinewood, he\r\nsaid to himself: "It is true I can make some thousands of francs here\r\nand then take up with advantage the profession of a soldier, or of a\r\npriest, according to the fashion then prevalent in France. The little\r\nhoard that I shall have amassed will remove all petty difficulties. In\r\nthe solitude of this mountain I shall have dissipated to some extent my\r\nawful ignorance of so many of the things which make up the life of all\r\nthose men of fashion. But Fouqu\xc3\xa9 has given up all thoughts of marriage,\r\nand at the same time keeps telling me that solitude makes him unhappy.\r\nIt is clear that if he takes a partner who has no capital to put into\r\nhis business, he does so in the hopes of getting a companion who will\r\nnever leave him."\r\n\r\n"Shall I deceive my friend," exclaimed Julien petulantly. This being\r\nwho found hypocrisy and complete callousness his ordinary means of\r\nself-preservation could not, on this occasion, endure the idea of the\r\nslightest lack of delicate feeling towards a man whom he loved.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly Julien was happy. He had a reason for a refusal. What!\r\nShall I be coward enough to waste seven or eight years. I shall get to\r\ntwenty-eight in that way! But at that age Bonaparte had achieved his\r\ngreatest feats. When I shall have made in obscurity a little money by\r\nfrequenting timber sales, and earning the good graces of some rascally\r\nunder-strappers who will guarantee that I shall still have the sacred\r\nfire with which one makes a name for oneself?\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Julien with considerable sangfroid, said in\r\nanswer to the good Fouqu\xc3\xa9, who regarded the matter of the partnership\r\nas settled, that his vocation for the holy ministry of the altars would\r\nnot permit him to accept it. Fouqu\xc3\xa9 did not return to the subject.\r\n\r\n"But just think," he repeated to him, "I\'ll make you my partner, or if\r\nyou prefer it, I\'ll give you four thousand francs a year, and you want\r\nto return to that M. de R\xc3\xaanal of yours, who despises you like the mud\r\non his shoes. When you have got two hundred louis in front of you, what\r\nis to prevent you from entering the seminary? I\'ll go further: I will\r\nundertake to procure for you the best living in the district, for,"\r\nadded Fouqu\xc3\xa9, lowering his voice, I supply firewood to M. le ----, M.\r\nle ----, M. ----. I provide them with first quality oak, but they only\r\npay me for plain wood, but never was money better invested.\r\n\r\nNothing could conquer Julien\'s vocation. Fouqu\xc3\xa9 finished by thinking\r\nhim a little mad. The third day, in the early morning, Julien left his\r\nfriend, and passed the day amongst the rocks of the great mountain. He\r\nfound his little cave again, but he had no longer peace of mind. His\r\nfriend\'s offers had robbed him of it. He found himself, not between\r\nvice and virtue, like Hercules, but between mediocrity coupled with\r\nan assured prosperity, and all the heroic dreams of his youth. "So I\r\nhave not got real determination after all," he said to himself, and it\r\nwas his doubt on this score which pained him the most. "I am not of\r\nthe stuff of which great men are made, because I fear that eight years\r\nspent in earning a livelihood will deprive me of that sublime energy\r\nwhich inspires the accomplishment of extraordinary feats."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE OPEN WORK STOCKINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n        A novel: a mirror which one takes out on one\'s walk\r\n        along the high road.--_Saint-R\xc3\xa9al_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Julien perceived the picturesque ruins of the old church at Vergy,\r\nhe noticed that he had not given a single thought to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nsince the day before yesterday. The other day, when I took my leave,\r\nthat woman made me realise the infinite distance which separated us;\r\nshe treated me like a labourer\'s son. No doubt she wished to signify\r\nher repentance for having allowed me to hold her hand the evening\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n... It is, however very pretty, is that hand. What a charm, what a\r\nnobility is there in that woman\'s expression!\r\n\r\nThe possibility of making a fortune with Fouqu\xc3\xa9 gave a certain facility\r\nto Julien\'s logic. It was not spoilt quite so frequently by the\r\nirritation and the keen consciousness of his poverty and low estate in\r\nthe eyes of the world. Placed as it were on a high promontory, he was\r\nable to exercise his judgment, and had a commanding view, so to speak,\r\nof both extreme poverty and that competence which he still called\r\nwealth. He was far from judging his position really philosophically,\r\nbut he had enough penetration to feel different after this little\r\njourney into the mountain.\r\n\r\nHe was struck with the extreme uneasiness with which Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nlistened to the brief account which she had asked for of his journey.\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 had had plans of marriage, and unhappy love affairs, and long\r\nconfidences on this subject had formed the staple of the two friends\'\r\nconversation. Having found happiness too soon, Fouqu\xc3\xa9 had realised\r\nthat he was not the only one who was loved. All these accounts had\r\nastonished Julien. He had learnt many new things. His solitary life of\r\nimagination and suspicion had kept him remote from anything which could\r\nenlighten him.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence, life had been nothing for Madame de R\xc3\xaanal but a\r\nseries of tortures, which, though different, were all unbearable. She\r\nwas really ill.\r\n\r\n"Now mind," said Madame Derville to her when she saw Julien arrive,\r\n"you don\'t go into the garden this evening in your weak state; the damp\r\nair will make your complaint twice as bad."\r\n\r\nMadame Derville was surprised to see that her friend, who was always\r\nscolded by M. de R\xc3\xaanal by reason of the excessive simplicity of her\r\ndress, had just got some open-work stockings and some charming little\r\nshoes which had come from Paris. For three days Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s only\r\ndistraction had been to cut out a summer dress of a pretty little\r\nmaterial which was very fashionable, and get it made with express speed\r\nby Elisa. This dress could scarcely have been finished a few moments\r\nbefore Julien\'s arrival, but Madame de R\xc3\xaanal put it on immediately. Her\r\nfriend had no longer any doubt. "She loves," unhappy woman, said Madame\r\nDerville to herself. She understood all the strange symptoms of the\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nShe saw her speak to Julien. The most violent blush was succeeded by\r\npallor. Anxiety was depicted in her eyes, which were riveted on those\r\nof the young tutor. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal expected every minute that he would\r\ngive an explanation of his conduct, and announce that he was either\r\ngoing to leave the house or stay there. Julien carefully avoided that\r\nsubject, and did not even think of it. After terrible struggles, Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal eventually dared to say to him in a trembling voice that\r\nmirrored all her passion:\r\n\r\n"Are you going to leave your pupils to take another place?"\r\n\r\nJulien was struck by Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s hesitating voice and look.\r\n"That woman loves me," he said to himself! "But after this temporary\r\nmoment of weakness, for which her pride is no doubt reproaching her,\r\nand as soon as she has ceased fearing that I shall leave, she will be\r\nas haughty as ever." This view of their mutual position passed through\r\nJulien\'s mind as rapidly as a flash of lightning. He answered with some\r\nhesitation,\r\n\r\n"I shall be extremely distressed to leave children who are so nice\r\nand so well-born, but perhaps it will be necessary. One has duties to\r\noneself as well."\r\n\r\nAs he pronounced the expression, "well-born" (it was one of those\r\naristocratic phrases which Julien had recently learnt), he became\r\nanimated by a profound feeling of antipathy.\r\n\r\n"I am not well-born," he said to himself, "in that woman\'s eyes."\r\n\r\nAs Madame de R\xc3\xaanal listened to him, she admired his genius and his\r\nbeauty, and the hinted possibility of his departure pierced her\r\nheart. All her friends at Verri\xc3\xa8res who had come to dine at Vergy\r\nduring Julien\'s absence had complimented her almost jealously on the\r\nastonishing man whom her husband had had the good fortune to unearth.\r\nIt was not that they understood anything about the progress of\r\nchildren. The feat of knowing his Bible by heart, and what is more, of\r\nknowing it in Latin, had struck the inhabitants of Verri\xc3\xa8res with an\r\nadmiration which will last perhaps a century.\r\n\r\nJulien, who never spoke to anyone, was ignorant of all this. If Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal had possessed the slightest presence of mind, she would have\r\ncomplimented him on the reputation which he had won, and Julien\'s\r\npride, once satisfied, he would have been sweet and amiable towards\r\nher, especially as he thought her new dress charming. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nwas also pleased with her pretty dress, and with what Julien had\r\nsaid to her about it, and wanted to walk round the garden. But she\r\nsoon confessed that she was incapable of walking. She had taken the\r\ntraveller\'s arm, and the contact of that arm, far from increasing her\r\nstrength, deprived her of it completely.\r\n\r\nIt was night. They had scarcely sat down before Julien, availing\r\nhimself of his old privilege, dared to bring his lips near his pretty\r\nneighbour\'s arm, and to take her hand. He kept thinking of the boldness\r\nwhich Fouqu\xc3\xa9 had exhibited with his mistresses and not of Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal; the word "well-born" was still heavy on his heart. He felt his\r\nhand pressed, but experienced no pleasure. So far from his being proud,\r\nor even grateful for the sentiment that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was betraying\r\nthat evening by only too evident signs, he was almost insensible to\r\nher beauty, her elegance, and her freshness. Purity of soul, and the\r\nabsence of all hateful emotion, doubtless prolong the duration of\r\nyouth. It is the face which ages first with the majority of women.\r\n\r\nJulien sulked all the evening. Up to the present he had only been angry\r\nwith the social order, but from that time that Fouqu\xc3\xa9 had offered him\r\nan ignoble means of obtaining a competency, he was irritated with\r\nhimself. Julien was so engrossed in his thoughts, that, although from\r\ntime to time he said a few words to the ladies, he eventually let go\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s hand without noticing it. This action overwhelmed the\r\nsoul of the poor woman. She saw in it her whole fate.\r\n\r\nIf she had been certain of Julien\'s affection, her virtue would\r\npossibly have found strength to resist him. But trembling lest she\r\nshould lose him for ever, she was distracted by her passion to\r\nthe point of taking again Julien\'s hand, which he had left in his\r\nabsent-mindedness leaning on the back of the chair. This action woke up\r\nthis ambitious youth; he would have liked to have had for witnesses all\r\nthose proud nobles who had regarded him at meals, when he was at the\r\nbottom of the table with the children, with so condescending a smile.\r\n"That woman cannot despise me; in that case," he said to himself. "I\r\nought to shew my appreciation of her beauty. I owe it to myself to be\r\nher lover." That idea would not have occurred to him before the na\xc3\xafve\r\nconfidences which his friend had made.\r\n\r\nThe sudden resolution which he had just made formed an agreeable\r\ndistraction. He kept saying to himself, "I must have one of those two\r\nwomen;" he realised that he would have very much preferred to have\r\npaid court to Madame Derville. It was not that she was more agreeable,\r\nbut that she had always seen him as the tutor distinguished by his\r\nknowledge, and not as the journeyman carpenter with his cloth jacket\r\nfolded under his arm as he had first appeared to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely as a young workman, blushing up to the whites of his\r\neyes, standing by the door of the house and not daring to ring, that he\r\nmade the most alluring appeal to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s imagination.\r\n\r\nAs he went on reviewing his position, Julien saw that the conquest of\r\nMadame Derville, who had probably noticed the taste which Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal was manifesting for him, was out of the question. He was thus\r\nbrought back to the latter lady. "What do I know of the character of\r\nthat woman?" said Julien to himself. "Only this: before my journey, I\r\nused to take her hand, and she used to take it away. To-day, I take my\r\nhand away, and she seizes and presses it. A fine opportunity to pay her\r\nback all the contempt she had had for me. God knows how many lovers she\r\nhas had, probably she is only deciding in my favour by reason of the\r\neasiness of assignations."\r\n\r\nSuch, alas, is the misfortune of an excessive civilisation. The soul\r\nof a young man of twenty, possessed of any education, is a thousand\r\nleagues away from that _abandon_ without which love is frequently but\r\nthe most tedious of duties.\r\n\r\n"I owe it all the more to myself," went on the petty vanity of Julien,\r\n"to succeed with that woman, by reason of the fact that if I ever make\r\na fortune, and I am reproached by anyone with my menial position as a\r\ntutor, I shall then be able to give out that it was love which got me\r\nthe post."\r\n\r\nJulien again took his hand away from Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, and then took her\r\nhand again and pressed it. As they went back to the drawing-room about\r\nmidnight, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal said to him in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"You are leaving us, you are going?"\r\n\r\nJulien answered with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"I absolutely must leave, for I love you passionately. It is wrong\r\n... how wrong indeed for a young priest?" Madame de R\xc3\xaanal leant upon\r\nhis arm, and with so much abandon that her cheek felt the warmth of\r\nJulien\'s.\r\n\r\nThe nights of these two persons were quite different. Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal was exalted by the ecstacies of the highest moral pleasure. A\r\ncoquettish young girl, who loves early in life, gets habituated to\r\nthe trouble of love, and when she reaches the age of real passion,\r\nfinds the charm of novelty lacking. As Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had never read\r\nany novels, all the refinements of her happiness were new to her. No\r\nmournful truth came to chill her, not even the spectre of the future.\r\nShe imagined herself as happy in ten years\' time as she was at the\r\npresent moment. Even the idea of virtue and of her sworn fidelity to M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal, which had agitated her some days past, now presented itself\r\nin vain, and was sent about its business like an importunate visitor.\r\n"I will never grant anything to Julien," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal; "we will\r\nlive in the future like we have been living for the last month. He\r\nshall be a friend."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH SCISSORS\r\n\r\n\r\n        A young girl of sixteen had a pink complexion, and yet\r\n        used red rouge.--_Polidori_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9\'s offer had, as a matter of fact, taken away all Julien\'s\r\nhappiness; he could not make up his mind to any definite course. "Alas!\r\nperhaps I am lacking in character. I should have been a bad soldier of\r\nNapoleon. At least," he added, "my little intrigue with the mistress of\r\nthe house will distract me a little."\r\n\r\nHappily for him, even in this little subordinate incident, his inner\r\nemotions quite failed to correspond with his flippant words. He was\r\nfrightened of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal because of her pretty dress. In his\r\neyes, that dress was a vanguard of Paris. His pride refused to leave\r\nanything to chance and the inspiration of the moment. He made himself\r\na very minute plan of campaign, moulded on the confidences of Fouqu\xc3\xa9,\r\nand a little that he had read about love in the Bible. As he was very\r\nnervous, though he did not admit it to himself, he wrote down this plan.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was alone with him for a moment in the drawing-room on\r\nthe following morning.\r\n\r\n"Have you no other name except Julien," she said.\r\n\r\nOur hero was at a loss to answer so nattering a question. This\r\ncircumstance had not been anticipated in his plan. If he had not been\r\nstupid enough to have made a plan, Julien\'s quick wit would have served\r\nhim well, and the surprise would only have intensified the quickness of\r\nhis perception.\r\n\r\nHe was clumsy, and exaggerated his clumsiness, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal quickly\r\nforgave him. She attributed it to a charming frankness. And an air of\r\nfrankness was the very thing which in her view was just lacking in this\r\nman who was acknowledged to have so much genius.\r\n\r\n"That little tutor of yours inspires me with a great deal of\r\nsuspicion," said Madame Derville to her sometimes. "I think he looks as\r\nif he were always thinking, and he never acts without calculation. He\r\nis a sly fox."\r\n\r\nJulien remained profoundly humiliated by the misfortune of not having\r\nknown what answer to make to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"A man like I am ought to make up for this check!" and seizing the\r\nmoment when they were passing from one room to another, he thought it\r\nwas his duty to give Madame de R\xc3\xaanal a kiss.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been less tactful, nothing less agreeable, and\r\nnothing more imprudent both for him and for her. They were within\r\nan inch of being noticed. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal thought him mad. She was\r\nfrightened, and above all, shocked. This stupidity reminded her of M.\r\nValenod.\r\n\r\n"What would happen to me," she said to herself, "if I were alone with\r\nhim?" All her virtue returned, because her love was waning.\r\n\r\nShe so arranged it that one of her children always remained with her.\r\nJulien found the day very tedious, and passed it entirely in clumsily\r\nputting into operation his plan of seduction. He did not look at Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal on a single occasion without that look having a reason, but\r\nnevertheless he was not sufficiently stupid to fail to see that he was\r\nnot succeeding at all in being amiable, and was succeeding even less in\r\nbeing fascinating.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal did not recover from her astonishment at finding him\r\nso awkward and at the same time so bold. "It is the timidity of love\r\nin men of intellect," she said to herself with an inexpressible joy.\r\n"Could it be possible that he had never been loved by my rival?"\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Madame de R\xc3\xaanal went back to the drawing-room to\r\nreceive the visit of M. Charcot de Maugiron, the sub-prefect of Bray.\r\nShe was working at a little frame of fancy-work some distance from the\r\nground. Madame Derville was at her side; that was how she was placed\r\nwhen our hero thought it suitable to advance his boot in the full\r\nlight and press the pretty foot of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, whose open-work\r\nstockings, and pretty Paris shoe were evidently attracting the looks of\r\nthe gallant sub-prefect.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was very much afraid, and let fall her scissors, her\r\nball of wool and her needles, so that Julien\'s movement could be passed\r\nfor a clumsy effort, intended to prevent the fall of the scissors,\r\nwhich presumably he had seen slide. Fortunately, these little scissors\r\nof English steel were broken, and Madame de R\xc3\xaanal did not spare her\r\nregrets that Julien had not succeeded in getting nearer to her. "You\r\nnoticed them falling before I did--you could have prevented it,\r\ninstead, all your zealousness only succeeding in giving me a very big\r\nkick." All this took in the sub-perfect, but not Madame Derville. "That\r\npretty boy has very silly manners," she thought. The social code of a\r\nprovincial capital never forgives this kind of lapse.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal found an opportunity of saying to Julien, "Be prudent,\r\nI order you."\r\n\r\nJulien appreciated his own clumsiness. He was upset. He deliberated\r\nwith himself for a long time, in order to ascertain whether or not he\r\nought to be angry at the expression "I order you." He was silly enough\r\nto think she might have said "I order you," if it were some question\r\nconcerning the children\'s education, but in answering my love she puts\r\nme on an equality. It is impossible to love without equality ... and\r\nall his mind ran riot in making common-places on equality. He angrily\r\nrepeated to himself that verse of Corneille which Madame Derville had\r\ntaught him some days before.\r\n\r\n                                      "L\'amour\r\n        les \xc3\xa9galit\xc3\xa9s, et ne les cherche pas."\r\n\r\nJulien who had never had a mistress in his whole life, but yet insisted\r\non playing the r\xc3\xb4le of a Don Juan, made a shocking fool of himself all\r\nday. He had only one sensible idea. Bored with himself and Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal, he viewed with apprehension the advance of the evening when he\r\nwould have to sit by her side in the darkness of the garden. He told M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal that he was going to Verri\xc3\xa8res to see the cur\xc3\xa9. He left after\r\ndinner, and only came back in the night.\r\n\r\nAt Verri\xc3\xa8res Julien found M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan occupied in moving. He had just\r\nbeen deprived of his living; the curate Maslon was replacing him.\r\nJulien helped the good cur\xc3\xa9, and it occurred to him to write to Fouqu\xc3\xa9\r\nthat the irresistible mission which he felt for the holy ministry had\r\npreviously prevented him from accepting his kind offer, but that he had\r\njust seen an instance of injustice, and that perhaps it would be safer\r\nnot to enter into Holy Orders.\r\n\r\nJulien congratulated himself on his subtlety in exploiting the\r\ndismissal of the cur\xc3\xa9 of Verri\xc3\xa8res so as to leave himself a loop-hole\r\nfor returning to commerce in the event of a gloomy prudence routing the\r\nspirit of heroism from his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE COCK\'S SONG\r\n\r\n    Amour en latin faict amour;\r\n    Or done provient d\'amour la mart,\r\n    Et, par avant, souley qui moreq,\r\n    Deuil, plours, pieges, forfailz, remord.\r\n                                     BLASON D\'AMOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Julien had possessed a little of that adroitness on which he so\r\ngratuitously plumed himself, he could have congratulated himself the\r\nfollowing day on the effect produced by his journey to Verri\xc3\xa8res. His\r\nabsence had caused his clumsiness to be forgotten. But on that day\r\nalso he was rather sulky. He had a ludicrous idea in the evening, and\r\nwith singular courage he communicated it to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. They had\r\nscarcely sat down in the garden before Julien brought his mouth near\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s ear without waiting till it was sufficiently dark and\r\nat the risk of compromising her terribly, said to her,\r\n\r\n"Madame, to-night, at two o\'clock, I shall go into your room, I must\r\ntell you something."\r\n\r\nJulien trembled lest his request should be granted. His rakish pose\r\nweighed him down so terribly that if he could have followed his own\r\ninclination he would have returned to his room for several days and\r\nrefrained from seeing the ladies any more. He realised that he had\r\nspoiled by his clever conduct of last evening all the bright prospects\r\nof the day that had just passed, and was at his wits\' end what to do.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal answered the impertinent declaration which Julien had\r\ndared to make to her with indignation which was real and in no way\r\nexaggerated. He thought he could see contempt in her curt reply. The\r\nexpression "for shame," had certainly occurred in that whispered answer.\r\n\r\nJulien went to the children\'s room under the pretext of having\r\nsomething to say to them, and on his return he placed himself beside\r\nMadame Derville and very far from Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. He thus deprived\r\nhimself of all possibility of taking her hand. The conversation was\r\nserious, and Julien acquitted himself very well, apart from a few\r\nmoments of silence during which he was cudgelling his brains.\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t I invent some pretty man\xc5\x93uvre," he said to himself which\r\nwill force Madame de R\xc3\xaanal to vouchsafe to me those unambiguous signs\r\nof tenderness which a few days ago made me think that she was mine.\r\n\r\nJulien was extremely disconcerted by the almost desperate plight\r\nto which he had brought his affairs. Nothing, however, would have\r\nembarrassed him more than success.\r\n\r\nWhen they separated at midnight, his pessimism made him think that\r\nhe enjoyed Madame Derville\'s contempt, and that probably he stood no\r\nbetter with Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nFeeling in a very bad temper and very humiliated, Julien did not sleep.\r\nHe was leagues away from the idea of giving up all intriguing and\r\nplanning, and of living from day to day with Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, and of\r\nbeing contented like a child with the happiness brought by every day.\r\n\r\nHe racked his brains inventing clever man\xc5\x93uvres, which an instant\r\nafterwards he found absurd, and, to put it shortly, was very unhappy\r\nwhen two o\'clock rang from the castle clock.\r\n\r\nThe noise woke him up like the cock\'s crow woke up St. Peter. The most\r\npainful episode was now timed to begin--he had not given a thought to\r\nhis impertinent proposition, since the moment when he had made it and\r\nit had been so badly received.\r\n\r\n"I have told her that I will go to her at two o\'clock," he said to\r\nhimself as he got up, "I may be inexperienced and coarse, as the son\r\nof a peasant naturally would be. Madame Derville has given me to\r\nunderstand as much, but at any rate, I will not be weak."\r\n\r\nJulien had reason to congratulate himself on his courage, for he had\r\nnever put his self-control to so painful a test. As he opened his door,\r\nhe was trembling to such an extent that his knees gave way under him,\r\nand he was forced to lean against the wall.\r\n\r\nHe was without shoes; he went and listened at M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s door, and\r\ncould hear his snoring. He was disconsolate, he had no longer any\r\nexcuse for not going to her room. But, Great Heaven! What was he to do\r\nthere? He had no plan, and even if he had had one, he felt himself so\r\nnervous that he would have been incapable of carrying it out.\r\n\r\nEventually, suffering a thousand times more than if he had been walking\r\nto his death, he entered the little corridor that led to Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal\'s room. He opened the door with a trembling hand and made a\r\nfrightful noise.\r\n\r\nThere was light; a night light was burning on the mantelpiece. He\r\nhad not expected this new misfortune. As she saw him enter, Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal got quickly out of bed. "Wretch," she cried. There was a\r\nlittle confusion. Julien forgot his useless plans, and turned to his\r\nnatural r\xc3\xb4le. To fail to please so charming a woman appeared to him the\r\ngreatest of misfortunes. His only answer to her reproaches was to throw\r\nhimself at her feet while he kissed her knees. As she was speaking to\r\nhim with extreme harshness, he burst into tears.\r\n\r\nWhen Julien came out of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s room some hours afterwards,\r\none could have said, adopting the conventional language of the novel,\r\nthat there was nothing left to be desired. In fact, he owed to the love\r\nhe had inspired, and to the unexpected impression which her alluring\r\ncharms had produced upon him, a victory to which his own clumsy tactics\r\nwould never have led him.\r\n\r\nBut victim that he was of a distorted pride, he pretended even in\r\nthe sweetest moments to play the r\xc3\xb4le of a man accustomed to the\r\nsubjugation of women: he made incredible but deliberate efforts to\r\nspoil his natural charm. Instead of watching the transports which he\r\nwas bringing into existence, and those pangs of remorse which only set\r\ntheir keenness into fuller relief, the idea of duty was continually\r\nbefore his eyes. He feared a frightful remorse, and eternal ridicule,\r\nif he departed from the ideal model he proposed to follow. In a word,\r\nthe very quality which made Julien into a superior being was precisely\r\nthat which prevented him from savouring the happiness which was placed\r\nwithin his grasp. It\'s like the case of a young girl of sixteen with a\r\ncharming complexion who is mad enough to put on rouge before going to a\r\nball.\r\n\r\nMortally terrified by the apparition of Julien, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was\r\nsoon a prey to the most cruel alarm. The prayers and despair of Julien\r\ntroubled her keenly.\r\n\r\nEven when there was nothing left for her to refuse him she pushed\r\nJulien away from her with a genuine indignation, and straightway threw\r\nherself into his arms. There was no plan apparent in all this conduct.\r\nShe thought herself eternally damned, and tried to hide from herself\r\nthe sight of hell by loading Julien with the wildest caresses. In a\r\nword, nothing would have been lacking in our hero\'s happiness, not even\r\nan ardent sensibility in the woman whom he had just captured, if he had\r\nonly known how to enjoy it. Julien\'s departure did not in any way bring\r\nto an end those ecstacies which thrilled her in spite of herself, and\r\nthose troubles of remorse which lacerated her.\r\n\r\n"My God! being happy--being loved, is that all it comes to?" This was\r\nJulien\'s first thought as he entered his room. He was a prey to the\r\nastonishment and nervous anxiety of the man who has just obtained\r\nwhat he has long desired. He has been accustomed to desire, and has\r\nno longer anything to desire, and nevertheless has no memories. Like\r\na soldier coming back from parade. Julien was absorbed in rehearsing\r\nthe details of his conduct. "Have I failed in nothing which I owe to\r\nmyself? Have I played my part well?"\r\n\r\nAnd what a part! the part of a man accustomed to be brilliant with\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE DAY AFTER\r\n\r\n\r\n    He turned his lips to hers and with his hand\r\n    Called back the tangles of her wandering hair.\r\n                               _Don Juan,_ c. I, st. 170.\r\n\r\n\r\nHappily for Julien\'s fame, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had been too agitated and\r\ntoo astonished to appreciate the stupidity of the man who had in a\r\nsingle moment become the whole to world her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God!" she said to herself, as she pressed him to retire when\r\nshe saw the dawn break, "if my husband has heard the noise, I am lost."\r\nJulien, who had had the time to make up some phrases, remembered this\r\none,\r\n\r\n"Would you regret your life?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, very much at a moment like this, but I should not regret having\r\nknown you."\r\n\r\nJulien thought it incumbent on his dignity to go back to his room in\r\nbroad daylight and with deliberate imprudence.\r\n\r\nThe continuous attention with which he kept on studying his slightest\r\nactions with the absurd idea of appearing a man of experience had only\r\none advantage. When he saw Madame de R\xc3\xaanal again at breakfast his\r\nconduct was a masterpiece of prudence.\r\n\r\nAs for her, she could not look at him without blushing up to the eyes,\r\nand could not live a moment without looking at him. She realised her\r\nown nervousness, and her efforts to hide it redoubled. Julien only\r\nlifted his eyes towards her once. At first Madame de R\xc3\xaanal admired\r\nhis prudence: soon seeing that this single look was not repealed, she\r\nbecame alarmed. "Could it be that he does not love me?" she said to\r\nherself. "Alas! I am quite old for him. I am ten years older than he\r\nis."\r\n\r\nAs she passed from the dining-room to the garden, she pressed Julien\'s\r\nhand. In the surprise caused by so singular a mark of love, he regarded\r\nher with passion, for he had thought her very pretty over breakfast,\r\nand while keeping his eyes downcast he had passed his time in thinking\r\nof the details of her charms. This look consoled Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. It\r\ndid not take away all her anxiety, but her anxiety tended to take away\r\nnearly completely all her remorse towards her husband.\r\n\r\nThe husband had noticed nothing at breakfast. It was not so with\r\nMadame Derville. She thought she saw Madame de R\xc3\xaanal on the point of\r\nsuccumbing. During the whole day her bold and incisive friendship\r\nregaled her cousin with those innuendoes which were intended to paint\r\nin hideous colours the dangers she was running.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was burning to find herself alone with Julien. She\r\nwished to ask him if he still loved her. In spite of the unalterable\r\nsweetness of her character, she was several times on the point of\r\nnotifying her friend how officious she was.\r\n\r\nMadame Derville arranged things so adroitly that evening in the garden,\r\nthat she found herself placed between Madame de R\xc3\xaanal and Julien.\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal, who had thought in her imagination how delicious it\r\nwould be to press Julien\'s hand and carry it to her lips, was not able\r\nto address a single word to him.\r\n\r\nThis hitch increased her agitation. She was devoured by one pang of\r\nremorse. She had so scolded Julien for his imprudence in coming to her\r\nroom on the preceding night, that she trembled lest he should not come\r\nto-night. She left the garden early and went and ensconced herself in\r\nher room, but not being able to control her impatience, she went and\r\nglued her ear to Julien\'s door. In spite of the uncertainty and passion\r\nwhich devoured her, she did not dare to enter. This action seemed\r\nto her the greatest possible meanness, for it forms the basis of a\r\nprovincial proverb.\r\n\r\nThe servants had not yet all gone to bed. Prudence at last compelled\r\nher to return to her room. Two hours of waiting were two centuries of\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nJulien was too faithful to what he called his duty to fail to\r\naccomplish stage by stage what he had mapped out for himself.\r\n\r\nAs one o\'clock struck, he escaped softly from his room, assured himself\r\nthat the master of the house was soundly asleep, and appeared in Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal\'s room. To-night he experienced more happiness by the side of\r\nhis love, for he thought less constantly about the part he had to play.\r\nHe had eyes to see, and ears to hear. What Madame de R\xc3\xaanal said to him\r\nabout his age contributed to give him some assurance.\r\n\r\n"Alas! I am ten years older than you. How can you love me?" she\r\nrepeated vaguely, because the idea oppressed her.\r\n\r\nJulien could not realise her happiness, but he saw that it was genuine\r\nand he forgot almost entirely his own fear of being ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe foolish thought that he was regarded as an inferior, by reason of\r\nhis obscure birth, disappeared also. As Julien\'s transports reassured\r\nhis timid mistress, she regained a little of her happiness, and of her\r\npower to judge her lover. Happily, he had not, on this occasion, that\r\nartificial air which had made the assignation of the previous night a\r\ntriumph rather than a pleasure. If she had realised his concentration\r\non playing a part that melancholy discovery would have taken away all\r\nher happiness for ever. She could only have seen in it the result of\r\nthe difference in their ages.\r\n\r\nAlthough Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had never thought of the theories of love,\r\ndifference in age is next to difference in fortune, one of the great\r\ncommonplaces of provincial witticisms, whenever love is the topic of\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nIn a few days Julien surrendered himself with all the ardour of his\r\nage, and was desperately in love.\r\n\r\n"One must own," he said to himself, "that she has an angelic kindness\r\nof soul, and no one in the world is prettier."\r\n\r\nHe had almost completely given up playing a part. In a moment of\r\nabandon, he even confessed to her all his nervousness. This confidence\r\nraised the passion which he was inspiring to its zenith. "And I have no\r\nlucky rival after all," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal to herself with delight.\r\nShe ventured to question him on the portrait in which he used to be so\r\ninterested. Julien swore to her that it was that of a man.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had enough presence of mind left to reflect, she\r\ndid not recover from her astonishment that so great a happiness could\r\nexist; and that she had never had anything of.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said to herself, "if I had only known Julien ten years ago\r\nwhen I was still considered pretty."\r\n\r\nJulien was far from having thoughts like these. His love was still\r\nakin to ambition. It was the joy of possessing, poor, unfortunate and\r\ndespised as he was, so beautiful a woman. His acts of devotion, and his\r\necstacies at the sight of his mistress\'s charms finished by reassuring\r\nher a little with regard to the difference of age. If she had possessed\r\na little of that knowledge of life which the woman of thirty has\r\nenjoyed in the more civilised of countries for quite a long time, she\r\nwould have trembled for the duration of a love, which only seemed to\r\nthrive on novelty and the intoxication of a young man\'s vanity. In\r\nthose moments when he forgot his ambition, Julien admired ecstatically\r\neven the hats and even the dresses of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. He could not\r\nsate himself with the pleasure of smelling their perfume. He would open\r\nher mirrored cupboard, and remain hours on end admiring the beauty and\r\nthe order of everything that he found there. His love leaned on him and\r\nlooked at him. He was looking at those jewels and those dresses which\r\nhad had been her wedding presents.\r\n\r\n"I might have married a man like that," thought Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nsometimes. "What a fiery soul! What a delightful life one would have\r\nwith him?"\r\n\r\nAs for Julien, he had never been so near to those terrible instruments\r\nof feminine artillery. "It is impossible," he said to himself "for\r\nthere to be anything more beautiful in Paris." He could find no flaw\r\nin his happiness. The sincere admiration and ecstacies of his mistress\r\nwould frequently make him forget that silly pose which had rendered\r\nhim so stiff and almost ridiculous during the first moments of the\r\nintrigue. There were moments where, in spite of his habitual hypocrisy,\r\nhe found an extreme delight in confessing to this great lady who\r\nadmired him, his ignorance of a crowd of little usages. His mistress\'s\r\nrank seemed to lift him above himself. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, on her side,\r\nwould find the sweetest thrill of intellectual voluptuousness in thus\r\ninstructing in a number of little things this young man who was so full\r\nof genius, and who was looked upon by everyone as destined one day to\r\ngo so far. Even the sub-prefect and M. Valenod could not help admiring\r\nhim. She thought it made them less foolish. As for Madame Derville, she\r\nwas very far from being in a position to express the same sentiments.\r\nRendered desperate by what she thought she divined, and seeing that\r\nher good advice was becoming offensive to a woman who had literally\r\nlost her head, she left Vergy without giving the explanation, which\r\nher friend carefully refrained from asking. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal shed a few\r\ntears for her, and soon found her happiness greater than ever. As a\r\nresult of her departure, she found herself alone with her lover nearly\r\nthe whole day.\r\n\r\nJulien abandoned himself all the more to the delightful society of his\r\nsweetheart, since, whenever he was alone, Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s fatal proposition\r\nstill continued to agitate him. During the first days of his novel life\r\nthere were moments when the man who had never loved, who had never been\r\nloved by anyone, would find so delicious a pleasure in being sincere,\r\nthat he was on the point of confessing to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal that ambition\r\nwhich up to then had been the very essence of his existence. He would\r\nhave liked to have been able to consult her on the strange temptation\r\nwhich Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s offer held out to him, but a little episode rendered any\r\nfrankness impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DEPUTY\r\n\r\n    Oh, how this spring of love resembleth\r\n    The uncertain glory of an April day,\r\n    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,\r\n    And by and by a cloud takes all away.\r\n                   _Two Gentlemen of Verona._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening when the sun was setting, and he was sitting near his love,\r\nat the bottom of the orchard, far from all intruders, he meditated\r\ndeeply. "Will such sweet moments" he said to himself "last for ever?"\r\nHis soul was engrossed in the difficulty of deciding on a calling. He\r\nlamented that great attack of unhappiness which comes at the end of\r\nchildhood and spoils the first years of youth in those who are not rich.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he exclaimed, "was not Napoleon the heaven-sent saviour for young\r\nFrenchmen? Who is to replace him? What will those unfortunate youths\r\ndo without him, who, even though they are richer than I am, have only\r\njust the few crowns necessary to procure an education for themselves,\r\nbut have not at the age of twenty enough money to buy a man and advance\r\nthemselves in their career." "Whatever one does," he added, with a deep\r\nsigh, "this fatal memory will always prevent our being happy."\r\n\r\nHe suddenly saw Madame de R\xc3\xaanal frown. She assumed a cold and\r\ndisdainful air. She thought his way of looking at things typical of a\r\nservant. Brought up as she was with the idea that she was very rich,\r\nshe took it for granted that Julien was so also. She loved him a\r\nthousand times more than life and set no store by money.\r\n\r\nJulien was far from guessing these ideas, but that frown brought him\r\nback to earth. He had sufficient presence of mind to manipulate his\r\nphrases, and to give the noble lady who was sitting so near him on the\r\ngrass seat to understand that the words he had just repeated had been\r\nheard by him during his journey to his friend the wood merchant. It was\r\nthe logic of infidels.\r\n\r\n"Well, have nothing to do with those people," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal,\r\nstill keeping a little of that icy air which had suddenly succeeded an\r\nexpression of the warmest tenderness.\r\n\r\nThis frown, or rather his remorse for his own imprudence, was the\r\nfirst check to the illusion which was transporting Julien. He said to\r\nhimself, "She is good and sweet, she has a great fancy for me, but she\r\nhas been brought up in the enemy\'s camp. They must be particularly\r\nafraid of that class of men of spirit who, after a good education, have\r\nnot enough money to take up a career. What would become of those nobles\r\nif we had an opportunity of fighting them with equal arms. Suppose me,\r\nfor example, mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res, and as well meaning and honest as M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal is at bottom. What short shrift I should make of the vicaire,\r\nM. Valenod and all their jobberies! How justice would triumph in\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res. It is not their talents which would stop me. They are always\r\nfumbling about."\r\n\r\nThat day Julien\'s happiness almost became permanent. Our hero lacked\r\nthe power of daring to be sincere. He ought to have had the courage to\r\nhave given battle, and on the spot; Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had been astonished\r\nby Julien\'s phrase, because the men in her circle kept on repeating\r\nthat the return of Robespierre was essentially possible by reason of\r\nthose over-educated young persons of the lower classes. Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal\'s coldness lasted a longish time, and struck Julien as marked.\r\nThe reason was that the fear that she had said something in some way or\r\nother disagreeable to him, succeeded her annoyance for his own breach\r\nof taste. This unhappiness was vividly reflected in those features\r\nwhich looked so pure and so na\xc3\xafve when she was happy and away from\r\nintruders.\r\n\r\nJulien no longer dared to surrender himself to his dreams. Growing\r\ncalmer and less infatuated, he considered that it was imprudent to go\r\nand see Madame de R\xc3\xaanal in her room. It was better for her to come to\r\nhim. If a servant noticed her going about the house, a dozen different\r\nexcuses could explain it.\r\n\r\nBut this arrangement had also its inconveniences. Julien had received\r\nfrom Fouqu\xc3\xa9 some books, which he, as a theology student would never\r\nhave dared to ask for in a bookshop. He only dared to open them at\r\nnight. He would often have found it much more convenient not to be\r\ninterrupted by a visit, the very waiting for which had even on the\r\nevening before the little scene in the orchard completely destroyed his\r\nmood for reading.\r\n\r\nHe had Madame de R\xc3\xaanal to thank for understanding books in quite a new\r\nway. He had dared to question her on a number of little things, the\r\nignorance of which cuts quite short the intellectual progress of any\r\nyoung man born out of society, however much natural genius one may\r\nchoose to ascribe to him.\r\n\r\nThis education given through sheer love by a woman who was extremely\r\nignorant, was a piece of luck. Julien managed to get a clear insight\r\ninto society such as it is to-day. His mind was not bewildered by the\r\nnarration of what it had been once, two thousand years ago, or even\r\nsixty years ago, in the time of Voltaire and Louis XV. The scales fell\r\nfrom his eyes to his inexpressible joy, and he understood at last what\r\nwas going on in Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\nIn the first place there were the very complicated intrigues which\r\nhad been woven for the last two years around the prefect of Besan\xc3\xa7on.\r\nThey were backed up by letters from Paris, written by the cream of\r\nthe aristocracy. The scheme was to make M. de Moirod (he was the most\r\ndevout man in the district) the first and not the second deputy of the\r\nmayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\nHe had for a competitor a very rich manufacturer whom it was essential\r\nto push back into the place of second deputy.\r\n\r\nJulien understood at last the innuendoes which he had surprised,\r\nwhen the high society of the locality used to come and dine at M. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal\'s. This privileged society was deeply concerned with the choice\r\nof a first deputy, while the rest of the town, and above all, the\r\nLiberals, did not even suspect its possibility. The factor which made\r\nthe matter important was that, as everybody knows, the east side of the\r\nmain street of Verri\xc3\xa8res has to be put more than nine feet back since\r\nthat street has become a royal route.\r\n\r\nNow if M. de Moirod, who had three houses liable to have their frontage\r\nput back, succeeded in becoming first deputy and consequently mayor in\r\nthe event of M. de R\xc3\xaanal being elected to the chamber, he would shut\r\nhis eyes, and it would be possible to make little imperceptible repairs\r\nin the houses projecting on to the public road, as the result of which\r\nthey would last a hundred years. In spite of the great piety and proved\r\nintegrity of M. de Moirod, everyone was certain that he would prove\r\namenable, because he had a great many children. Among the houses liable\r\nto have their frontage put back nine belonged to the cream of Verri\xc3\xa8res\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIn Julien\'s eyes this intrigue was much more important than the history\r\nof the battle of Fontenoy, whose name he now came across for the first\r\ntime in one of the books which Fouqu\xc3\xa9 had sent him. There had been\r\nmany things which had astonished Julien since the time five years ago\r\nwhen he had started going to the cur\xc3\xa9\'s in the evening. But discretion\r\nand humility of spirit being the primary qualities of a theological\r\nstudent, it had always been impossible for him to put questions.\r\n\r\nOne day Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was giving an order to her husband\'s valet who\r\nwas Julien\'s enemy.\r\n\r\n"But, Madame, to-day is the last Friday in the month," the man answered\r\nin a rather strange manner.\r\n\r\n"Go," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Julien, "I suppose he\'s going to go to that corn shop\r\nwhich was once a church, and has recently been restored to religion,\r\nbut what is he going to do there? That\'s one of the mysteries which I\r\nhave never been able to fathom."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very literary institution, but a very curious one," answered\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal. "Women are not admitted to it. All I know is, that\r\neverybody uses the second person singular. This servant, for instance,\r\nwill go and meet M. Valenod there, and the haughty prig will not be\r\na bit offended at hearing himself addressed by Saint-Jean in that\r\nfamiliar way, and will answer him in the same way. If you are keen on\r\nknowing what takes place, I will ask M. de Maugiron and M. Valenod\r\nfor details. We pay twenty francs for each servant, to prevent their\r\ncutting our throats one fine day."\r\n\r\nTime flew. The memory of his mistress\'s charms distracted Julien from\r\nhis black ambition. The necessity of refraining from mentioning gloomy\r\nor intellectual topics since they both belonged to opposing parties,\r\nadded, without his suspecting it, to the happiness which he owed her,\r\nand to the dominion which she acquired over him.\r\n\r\nOn the occasions when the presence of the precocious children reduced\r\nthem to speaking the language of cold reason, Julien looking at her\r\nwith eyes sparkling with love, would listen with complete docility to\r\nher explanations of the world as it is. Frequently, in the middle of an\r\naccount of some cunning piece of jobbery, with reference to a road or\r\na contract, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s mind would suddenly wander to the very\r\npoint of delirium. Julien found it necessary to scold her. She indulged\r\nwhen with him in the same intimate gestures which she used with her\r\nown children. The fact was that there were days when she deceived\r\nherself that she loved him like her own child. Had she not repeatedly\r\nto answer his na\xc3\xafve questions about a thousand simple things that a\r\nwell-born child of fifteen knows quite well? An instant afterwards\r\nshe would admire him like her master. His genius would even go so far\r\nas to frighten her. She thought she should see more clearly every day\r\nthe future great man in this young abb\xc3\xa9. She saw him Pope; she saw him\r\nfirst minister like Richelieu. "Shall I live long enough to see you in\r\nyour glory?" she said to Julien. "There is room for a great man; church\r\nand state have need of one."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA KING AT VERRI\xc3\x88RES\r\n\r\n\r\n    Do you not deserve to be thrown aside like a plebeian\r\n    corpse which has no soul and whose blood flows no\r\n    longer in its veins.\r\n                   _Sermon of the Bishop at the Chapel of Saint Clement_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of September at ten o\'clock in the evening, a gendarme woke\r\nup the whole of Verri\xc3\xa8res by galloping up the main street. He brought\r\nthe news that His Majesty the King of ---- would arrive the following\r\nSunday, and it was already Tuesday. The prefect authorised, that is to\r\nsay, demanded the forming of a guard of honour. They were to exhibit\r\nall possible pomp. An express messenger was sent to Vergy. M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\narrived during the night and found the town in a commotion. Each\r\nindividual had his own pretensions; those who were less busy hired\r\nbalconies to see the King.\r\n\r\nWho was to command the Guard of Honour? M. de R\xc3\xaanal at once realised\r\nhow essential it was in the interests of the houses liable to have\r\ntheir frontage put back that M. de Moirod should have the command.\r\nThat might entitle him to the post of first deputy-mayor. There was\r\nnothing to say against the devoutness of M. de Moirod. It brooked\r\nno comparison, but he had never sat on a horse. He was a man of\r\nthirty-six, timid in every way, and equally frightened of falling and\r\nof looking ridiculous. The mayor had summoned him as early as five\r\no\'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n"You see, monsieur, I ask your advice, as though you already occupy\r\nthat post to which all the people on the right side want to carry you.\r\nIn this unhappy town, manufacturers are prospering, the Liberal party\r\nis becoming possessed of millions, it aspires to power; it will manage\r\nto exploit everything to its own ends. Let us consult the interests of\r\nthe king, the interest of the monarchy, and above all, the interest of\r\nour holy religion. Who do you think, monsieur, could be entrusted with\r\nthe command of the guard of honour?"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the terrible fear with which horses inspired him, M. de\r\nMoirod finished by accepting this honour like a martyr. "I shall know\r\nhow to take the right tone," he said to the mayor. There was scarcely\r\ntime enough to get ready the uniforms which had served seven years ago\r\non the occasion of the passage of a prince of the blood.\r\n\r\nAt seven o\'clock, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal arrived at Vergy with Julien and\r\nthe children. She found her drawing room filled with Liberal ladies\r\nwho preached the union of all parties and had come to beg her to urge\r\nher husband to grant a place to theirs in the guard of honour. One of\r\nthem actually asserted that if her husband was not chosen he would go\r\nbankrupt out of chagrin. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal quickly got rid of all these\r\npeople. She seemed very engrossed.\r\n\r\nJulien was astonished, and what was more, angry that she should make\r\na mystery of what was disturbing her, "I had anticipated it," he said\r\nbitterly to himself. "Her love is being over-shadowed by the happiness\r\nof receiving a King in her house. All this hubbub overcomes her. She\r\nwill love me once more when the ideas of her caste no longer trouble\r\nher brain."\r\n\r\nAn astonishing fact, he only loved her the more.\r\n\r\nThe decorators began to fill the house. He watched a long time for the\r\nopportunity to exchange a few words. He eventually found her as she was\r\ncoming out of his own room, carrying one of his suits. They were alone.\r\nHe tried to speak to her. She ran away, refusing to listen to him. "I\r\nam an absolute fool to love a woman like that, whose ambition renders\r\nher as mad as her husband."\r\n\r\nShe was madder. One of her great wishes which she had never confessed\r\nto Julien for fear of shocking him, was to see him leave off, if only\r\nfor one day, his gloomy black suit. With an adroitness which was truly\r\nadmirable in so ingenuous a woman, she secured first from M. de Moirod,\r\nand subsequently, from M. the sub-perfect de Maugiron, an assurance\r\nthat Julien should be nominated a guard of honour in preference to five\r\nor six young people, the sons of very well-off manufacturers, of whom\r\ntwo at least, were models of piety. M. de Valenod, who reckoned on\r\nlending his carriage to the prettiest women in the town, and on showing\r\noff his fine Norman steeds, consented to let Julien (the being he hated\r\nmost in the whole world) have one of his horses. But all the guards of\r\nhonour, either possessed or had borrowed, one of those pretty sky-blue\r\nuniforms, with two silver colonel epaulettes, which had shone seven\r\nyears ago. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal wanted a new uniform, and she only had four\r\ndays in which to send to Besan\xc3\xa7on and get from there the uniform, the\r\narms, the hat, etc., everything necessary for a Guard of Honour. The\r\nmost delightful part of it was that she thought it imprudent to get\r\nJulien\'s uniform made at Verri\xc3\xa8res. She wanted to surprise both him and\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nHaving settled the questions of the guards of honour, and of the public\r\nwelcome finished, the mayor had now to organise a great religious\r\nceremony. The King of ---- did not wish to pass through Verri\xc3\xa8res\r\nwithout visiting the famous relic of St. Clement, which is kept at\r\nBray-le-Haut barely a league from the town. The authorities wanted\r\nto have a numerous attendance of the clergy, but this matter was the\r\nmost difficult to arrange. M. Maslon, the new cur\xc3\xa9, wanted to avoid at\r\nany price the presence of M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan. It was in vain that M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\ntried to represent to him that it would be imprudent to do so. M. the\r\nMarquis de La Mole whose ancestors had been governors of the province\r\nfor so many generations, had been chosen to accompany the King of ----.\r\nHe had known the abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan for thirty years. He would certainly ask\r\nnews of him when he arrived at Verri\xc3\xa8res, and if he found him disgraced\r\nhe was the very man to go and route him out in the little house to\r\nwhich he had retired, accompanied by all the escort that he had at his\r\ndisposition. What a rebuff that would be?\r\n\r\n"I shall be disgraced both here and at Besan\xc3\xa7on," answered the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nMaslon, "if he appears among my clergy. A Jansenist, by the Lord."\r\n\r\n"Whatever you can say, my dear abb\xc3\xa9," replied M. de R\xc3\xaanal, "I\'ll never\r\nexpose the administration of Verri\xc3\xa8res to receiving such an affront\r\nfrom M. de la Mole. You do not know him. He is orthodox enough at\r\nCourt, but here in the provinces, he is a satirical wit and cynic,\r\nwhose only object is to make people uncomfortable. He is capable of\r\ncovering us with ridicule in the eyes of the Liberals, simply in order\r\nto amuse himself."\r\n\r\nIt was only on the night between the Saturday and the Sunday, after\r\nthree whole days of negotiations that the pride of the abb\xc3\xa9 Maslon bent\r\nbefore the fear of the mayor, which was now changing into courage. It\r\nwas necessary to write a honeyed letter to the abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan, begging\r\nhim to be present at the ceremony in connection with the relic of\r\nBray-le-Haut, if of course, his great age and his infirmity allowed him\r\nto do so. M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan asked for and obtained a letter of invitation for\r\nJulien, who was to accompany him as his sub-deacon.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the Sunday morning, thousands of peasants began\r\nto arrive from the neighbouring mountains, and to inundate the streets\r\nof Verri\xc3\xa8res. It was the finest sunshine. Finally, about three o\'clock,\r\na thrill swept through all this crowd. A great fire had been perceived\r\non a rock two leagues from Verri\xc3\xa8res. This signal announced that the\r\nking had just entered the territory of the department. At the same\r\ntime, the sound of all the bells and the repeated volleys from an old\r\nSpanish cannon which belonged to the town, testified to its joy at\r\nthis great event. Half the population climbed on to the roofs. All the\r\nwomen were on the balconies. The guard of honour started to march, The\r\nbrilliant uniforms were universally admired; everybody recognised a\r\nrelative or a friend. They made fun of the timidity of M. de Moirod,\r\nwhose prudent hand was ready every single minute to catch hold of his\r\nsaddle-bow. But one remark resulted in all the others being forgotten;\r\nthe first cavalier in the ninth line was a very pretty, slim boy, who\r\nwas not recognised at first. He soon created a general sensation, as\r\nsome uttered a cry of indignation, and others were dumbfounded with\r\nastonishment. They recognised in this young man, who was sitting one\r\nof the Norman horses of M. Valenod, little Sorel, the carpenter\'s son.\r\nThere was a unanimous out-cry against the mayor, above all on the part\r\nof the Liberals. What, because this little labourer, who masqueraded as\r\nan abb\xc3\xa9, was tutor to his brats, he had the audacity to nominate him\r\nguard of honour to the prejudice of rich manufacturers like so-and-so\r\nand so-and-so! "Those gentlemen," said a banker\'s wife, "ought to put\r\nthat insolent gutter-boy in his proper place."\r\n\r\n"He is cunning and carries a sabre," answered her neighbour. "He would\r\nbe dastardly enough to slash them in the face."\r\n\r\nThe conversation of aristocratic society was more dangerous. The ladies\r\nbegan to ask each other if the mayor alone was responsible for this\r\ngrave impropriety. Speaking generally, they did justice to his contempt\r\nfor lack of birth.\r\n\r\nJulien was the happiest of men, while he was the subject of so much\r\nconversation. Bold by nature, he sat a horse better than the majority\r\nof the young men of this mountain town. He saw that, in the eyes of the\r\nwomen, he was the topic of interest.\r\n\r\nHis epaulettes were more brilliant than those of the others, because\r\nthey were new. His horse pranced at every moment. He reached the zenith\r\nof joy.\r\n\r\nHis happiness was unbounded when, as they passed by the old rampart,\r\nthe noise of the little cannon made his horse prance outside the line.\r\nBy a great piece of luck he did not fall; from that moment he felt\r\nhimself a hero. He was one of Napoleon\'s officers of artillery, and was\r\ncharging a battery.\r\n\r\nOne person was happier than he. She had first seen him pass from one\r\nof the folding windows in the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville. Then taking her carriage\r\nand rapidly making a long detour, she arrived in time to shudder when\r\nhis horse took him outside the line. Finally she put her carriage to\r\nthe gallop, left by another gate of the town, succeeded in rejoining\r\nthe route by which the King was to pass, and was able to follow the\r\nGuard of Honour at twenty paces distance in the midst of a noble dust.\r\nSix thousand peasants cried "Long live the King," when the mayor had\r\nthe honour to harangue his Majesty. An hour afterwards, when all the\r\nspeeches had been listened to, and the King was going to enter the\r\ntown, the little cannon began again to discharge its spasmodic volleys.\r\nBut an accident ensued, the victim being, not one of the cannoneers who\r\nhad proved their mettle at Leipsic and at Montreuil, but the future\r\ndeputy-mayor, M. de Moirod. His horse gently laid him in the one heap\r\nof mud on the high road, a somewhat scandalous circumstance, inasmuch\r\nas it was necessary to extricate him to allow the King to pass. His\r\nMajesty alighted at the fine new church, which was decked out to-day\r\nwith all its crimson curtains. The King was due to dine, and then\r\nafterwards take his carriage again and go and pay his respects to the\r\ncelebrated relic of Saint Clement. Scarcely was the King in the church\r\nthan Julien galloped towards the house of M. de R\xc3\xaanal. Once there\r\nhe doffed with a sigh his fine sky-blue uniform, his sabre and his\r\nepaulettes, to put on again his shabby little black suit. He mounted\r\nhis horse again, and in a few moments was at Bray-le-Haut, which was\r\non the summit of a very pretty hill. "Enthusiasm is responsible for\r\nthese numbers of peasants," thought Julien. It was impossible to move\r\na step at Verri\xc3\xa8res, and here there were more than ten thousand round\r\nthis ancient abbey. Half ruined by the vandalism of the Revolution,\r\nit had been magnificently restored since the Restoration, and people\r\nwere already beginning to talk of miracles. Julien rejoined the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nCh\xc3\xa9lan, who scolded him roundly and gave him a cassock and a surplice.\r\nHe dressed quickly and followed M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan, who was going to pay a call\r\non the young bishop of Agde. He was a nephew of M. de la Mole, who had\r\nbeen recently nominated, and had been charged with the duty of showing\r\nthe relic to the King. But the bishop was not to be found.\r\n\r\nThe clergy began to get impatient. It was awaiting its chief in the\r\nsombre Gothic cloister of the ancient abbey. Twenty-four cur\xc3\xa9s had\r\nbeen brought together so as to represent the ancient chapter of\r\nBray-le-Haut, which before 1789 consisted of twenty-four canons. The\r\ncur\xc3\xa9s, having deplored the bishop\'s youth for three-quarters of an\r\nhour, thought it fitting for their senior to visit Monseigneur to\r\napprise him that the King was on the point of arriving, and that it was\r\ntime to betake himself to the choir. The great age of M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan gave\r\nhim the seniority. In spite of the bad temper which he was manifesting\r\nto Julien, he signed him to follow. Julien was wearing his surplice\r\nwith distinction. By means of some trick or other of ecclesiastical\r\ndress, he had made his fine curling hair very flat, but by a\r\nforgetfulness, which redoubled the anger of M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan, the spurs of the\r\nGuard of Honour could be seen below the long folds of his cassock.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the bishop\'s apartment, the tall lackeys with\r\ntheir lace-frills scarcely deigned to answer the old cur\xc3\xa9 to the effect\r\nthat Monseigneur was not receiving. They made fun of him when he tried\r\nto explain that in his capacity of senior member of the chapter of\r\nBray-le-Haut, he had the privilege of being admitted at any time to the\r\nofficiating bishop.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s haughty temper was shocked by the lackeys\' insolence. He\r\nstarted to traverse the corridors of the ancient abbey, and to shake\r\nall the doors which he found. A very small one yielded to his efforts,\r\nand he found himself in a cell in the midst of Monseigneur\'s valets,\r\nwho were dressed in black suits with chains on their necks. His hurried\r\nmanner made these gentlemen think that he had been sent by the bishop,\r\nand they let him pass. He went some steps further on, and found himself\r\nin an immense Gothic hall, which was extremely dark, and completely\r\nwainscotted in black oak. The ogive windows had all been walled in\r\nwith brick except one. There was nothing to disguise the coarseness\r\nof this masonry, which offered a melancholy contrast to the ancient\r\nmagnificence of the woodwork. The two great sides of this hall, so\r\ncelebrated among Burgundian antiquaries, and built by the Duke, Charles\r\nthe Bold, about 1470 in expiation of some sin, were adorned with richly\r\nsculptured wooden stalls. All the mysteries of the Apocalypse were to\r\nbe seen portrayed in wood of different colours.\r\n\r\nThis melancholy magnificence, debased as it was by the sight of the\r\nbare bricks and the plaster (which was still quite white) affected\r\nJulien. He stopped in silence. He saw at the other extremity of the\r\nhall, near the one window which let in the daylight, a movable mahogany\r\nmirror. A young man in a violet robe and a lace surplice, but with his\r\nhead bare, was standing still three paces from the glass. This piece\r\nof furniture seemed strange in a place like this, and had doubtless\r\nbeen only brought there on the previous day. Julien thought that the\r\nyoung man had the appearance of being irritated. He was solemnly giving\r\nbenedictions with his right hand close to the mirror.\r\n\r\n"What can this mean," he thought. "Is this young priest performing some\r\npreliminary ceremony? Perhaps he is the bishop\'s secretary. He will be\r\nas insolent as the lackeys. Never mind though! Let us try." He advanced\r\nand traversed somewhat slowly the length of the hall, with his gaze\r\nfixed all the time on the one window, and looking at the young man who\r\ncontinued without any intermission bestowing slowly an infinite number\r\nof blessings.\r\n\r\nThe nearer he approached the better he could distinguish his angry\r\nmanner. The richness of the lace surplice stopped Julien in spite of\r\nhimself some paces in front of the mirror. "It is my duty to speak," he\r\nsaid to himself at last. But the beauty of the hall had moved him, and\r\nhe was already upset by the harsh words he anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe young man saw him in the mirror, turned round, and suddenly\r\ndiscarding his angry manner, said to him in the gentlest tone,\r\n\r\n"Well, Monsieur, has it been arranged at last?"\r\n\r\nJulien was dumbfounded. As the young man began to turn towards him,\r\nJulien saw the pectoral cross on his breast. It was the bishop of Agde.\r\n"As young as that," thought Julien. "At most six or eight years older\r\nthan I am!"\r\n\r\nHe was ashamed of his spurs.\r\n\r\n"Monseigneur," he said at last, "I am sent by M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan, the senior of\r\nthe chapter."\r\n\r\n"Ah, he has been well recommended to me," said the bishop in a polished\r\ntone which doubled Julien\'s delight, "But I beg your pardon, Monsieur,\r\nI mistook you for the person who was to bring me my mitre. It was badly\r\npacked at Paris. The silver cloth towards the top has been terribly\r\nspoiled. It will look awful," ended the young bishop sadly, "And\r\nbesides, I am being kept waiting."\r\n\r\n"Monseigneur, I will go and fetch the mitre if your grace will let me."\r\n\r\nJulien\'s fine eyes did their work.\r\n\r\n"Go, Monsieur," answered the bishop, with charming politeness. "I need\r\nit immediately. I am grieved to keep the gentlemen of the chapter\r\nwaiting."\r\n\r\nWhen Julien reached the centre of the hall, he turned round towards the\r\nbishop, and saw that he had again commenced giving benedictions.\r\n\r\n"What can it be?" Julien asked himself. "No doubt it is a necessary\r\necclesiastical preliminary for the ceremony which is to take place."\r\nWhen he reached the cell in which the valets were congregated, he\r\nsaw the mitre in their hands. These gentlemen succumbed in spite of\r\nthemselves to his imperious look, and gave him Monseigneur\'s mitre.\r\n\r\nHe felt proud to carry it. As he crossed the hall he walked slowly. He\r\nheld it with reverence. He found the bishop seated before the glass,\r\nbut from time to time, his right hand, although fatigued, still gave a\r\nblessing. Julien helped him to adjust his mitre. The bishop shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it will keep on," he said to Julien with an air of satisfaction.\r\n"Do you mind going a little way off?"\r\n\r\nThen the bishop went very quickly to the centre of the room, then\r\napproached the mirror, again resumed his angry manner, and gravely\r\nbegan to give blessings.\r\n\r\nJulien was motionless with astonishment. He was tempted to understand,\r\nbut did not dare. The bishop stopped, and suddenly abandoning his grave\r\nmanner looked at him and said:\r\n\r\n"What do you think of my mitre, monsieur, is it on right?"\r\n\r\n"Quite right, Monseigneur."\r\n\r\n"It is not too far back? That would look a little silly, but I mustn\'t\r\non the other hand wear it down over the eyes like an officer\'s shako."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me to be on quite right."\r\n\r\n"The King of ---- is accustomed to a venerable clergy who are doubtless\r\nvery solemn. I should not like to appear lacking in dignity, especially\r\nby reason of my youth."\r\n\r\nAnd the bishop started again to walk about and give benedictions.\r\n\r\n"It is quite clear," said Julien, daring to understand at last, "He is\r\npractising giving his benediction."\r\n\r\n"I am ready," the bishop said after a few moments. "Go, Monsieur, and\r\nadvise the senior and the gentlemen of the chapter."\r\n\r\nSoon M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan, followed by the two oldest cur\xc3\xa9s, entered by a big\r\nmagnificently sculptured door, which Julien had not previously noticed.\r\nBut this time he remained in his place quite at the back, and was only\r\nable to see the bishop over the shoulders of ecclesiastics who were\r\npressing at the door in crowds.\r\n\r\nThe bishop began slowly to traverse the hall. When he reached the\r\nthreshold, the cur\xc3\xa9s formed themselves into a procession. After a short\r\nmoment of confusion, the procession began to march intoning the psalm.\r\nThe bishop, who was between M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan and a very old cur\xc3\xa9, was the last\r\nto advance. Julien being in attendance on the abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan managed to\r\nget quite near Monseigneur. They followed the long corridors of the\r\nabbey of Bray-le-Haut. In spite of the brilliant sun they were dark and\r\ndamp. They arrived finally at the portico of the cloister. Julien was\r\ndumbfounded with admiration for so fine a ceremony. His emotions were\r\ndivided between thoughts of his own ambition which had been reawakened\r\nby the bishop\'s youth and thoughts of the latter\'s refinement and\r\nexquisite politeness. This politeness was quite different to that of M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal, even on his good days. "The higher you lift yourself towards\r\nthe first rank of society," said Julien to himself, "the more charming\r\nmanners you find."\r\n\r\nThey entered the church by a side door; suddenly an awful noise made\r\nthe ancient walls echo. Julien thought they were going to crumble. It\r\nwas the little piece of artillery again. It had been drawn at a gallop\r\nby eight horses and had just arrived. Immediately on its arrival it had\r\nbeen run out by the Leipsic cannoneers and fired five shots a minute as\r\nthough the Prussians had been the target.\r\n\r\nBut this admirable noise no longer produced any effect on Julien. He no\r\nlonger thought of Napoleon and military glory. "To be bishop of Agde so\r\nyoung," he thought. "But where is Agde? How much does it bring in? Two\r\nor three hundred thousand francs, perhaps."\r\n\r\nMonseigneur\'s lackeys appeared with a magnificent canopy. M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan\r\ntook one of the poles, but as a matter of fact it was Julien who\r\ncarried it. The bishop took his place underneath. He had really\r\nsucceeded in looking old; and our hero\'s admiration was now quite\r\nunbounded. "What can\'t one accomplish with skill," he thought.\r\n\r\nThe king entered. Julien had the good fortune to see him at close\r\nquarters. The bishop began to harangue him with unction, without\r\nforgetting a little nuance of very polite anxiety for his Majesty.\r\nWe will not repeat a description of the ceremony of Bray-le-Haut.\r\nThey filled all the columns of the journals of the department for a\r\nfortnight on end. Julien learnt from the bishop that the king was\r\ndescended from Charles the Bold.\r\n\r\nAt a later date, it was one of Julien\'s duties to check the accounts\r\nof the cost of this ceremony. M. de la Mole, who had succeeded in\r\nprocuring a bishopric for his nephew, had wished to do him the favour\r\nof being himself responsible for all the expenses. The ceremony alone\r\nof Bray-le-Haute cost three thousand eight hundred francs.\r\n\r\nAfter the speech of the bishop, and the answer of the king, his\r\nMajesty took up a position underneath the canopy, and then knelt very\r\ndevoutly on a cushion near the altar. The choir was surrounded by\r\nstalls, and the stalls were raised two steps from the pavement. It\r\nwas at the bottom of these steps that Julien sat at the feet of M.\r\nde Ch\xc3\xa9lan almost like a train-bearer sitting next to his cardinal in\r\nthe Sixtine chapel at Rome. There was a _Te Deum_, floods of incense,\r\ninnumerable volleys of musketry and artillery; the peasants were drunk\r\nwith happiness and piety. A day like this undoes the work of a hundred\r\nnumbers of the Jacobin papers.\r\n\r\nJulien was six paces from the king, who was really praying with\r\ndevotion. He noticed for the first time a little man with a witty\r\nexpression, who wore an almost plain suit. But he had a sky-blue ribbon\r\nover this very simple suit. He was nearer the king than many other\r\nlords, whose clothes were embroidered with gold to such an extent that,\r\nto use Julien\'s expression, it was impossible to see the cloth. He\r\nlearnt some minutes later that it was Monsieur de la Mole. He thought\r\nhe looked haughty, and even insolent.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure this marquis is not so polite as my pretty bishop," he\r\nthought. "Ah, the ecclesiastical calling makes men mild and good. But\r\nthe king has come to venerate the relic, and I don\'t see a trace of the\r\nrelic. Where has Saint Clement got to?"\r\n\r\nA little priest who sat next to him informed him that the venerable\r\nrelic was at the top of the building in a _chapelle ardente_.\r\n\r\n"What is a _chapelle ardente_," said Julien to himself.\r\n\r\nBut he was reluctant to ask the meaning of this word. He redoubled his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe etiquette on the occasion of a visit of a sovereign prince is\r\nthat the canons do not accompany the bishop. But, as he started on\r\nhis march to the _chapelle ardente_, my lord bishop of Agde called\r\nthe abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan. Julien dared to follow him. Having climbed up a long\r\nstaircase, they reached an extremely small door whose Gothic frame\r\nwas magnificently gilded. This work looked as though it had been\r\nconstructed the day before.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four young girls belonging to the most distinguished families in\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res were assembled in front of the door. The bishop knelt down\r\nin the midst of these pretty maidens before he opened the door. While\r\nhe was praying aloud, they seemed unable to exhaust their admiration\r\nfor his fine lace, his gracious mien, and his young and gentle face.\r\nThis spectacle deprived our hero of his last remnants of reason. At\r\nthis moment he would have fought for the Inquisition, and with a good\r\nconscience. The door suddenly opened. The little chapel was blazing\r\nwith light. More than a thousand candles could be seen before the\r\naltar, divided into eight lines and separated from each other by\r\nbouquets of flowers. The suave odour of the purest incense eddied\r\nout from the door of the sanctuary. The chapel, which had been newly\r\ngilded, was extremely small but very high. Julien noticed that there\r\nwere candles more than fifteen feet high upon the altar. The young\r\ngirls could not restrain a cry of admiration. Only the twenty-four\r\nyoung girls, the two cur\xc3\xa9s and Julien had been admitted into the little\r\nvestibule of the chapel. Soon the king arrived, followed by Monsieur\r\nde la Mole and his great Chamberlain. The guards themselves remained\r\noutside kneeling and presenting arms.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty precipitated, rather than threw himself, on to the stool.\r\nIt was only then that Julien, who was keeping close to the gilded\r\ndoor, perceived over the bare arm of a young girl, the charming statue\r\nof St. Clement. It was hidden under the altar, and bore the dress of\r\na young Roman soldier. It had a large wound on its neck, from which\r\nthe blood seemed to flow. The artist had surpassed himself. The eyes,\r\nwhich though dying were full of grace, were half closed. A budding\r\nmoustache adored that charming mouth which, though half closed, seemed\r\nnotwithstanding to be praying. The young girl next to Julien wept warm\r\ntears at the sight. One of her tears fell on Julien\'s hand.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of prayer in the profoundest silence, that was only\r\nbroken by the distant sound of the bells of all the villages within a\r\nradius of ten leagues, the bishop of Agde asked the king\'s permission\r\nto speak. He finished a short but very touching speech with a passage,\r\nthe very simplicity of which assured its effectiveness:\r\n\r\n"Never forget, young Christian women, that you have seen one of the\r\ngreatest kings of the world on his knees before the servants of\r\nthis Almighty and terrible God. These servants, feeble, persecuted,\r\nassassinated as they were on earth, as you can see by the still\r\nbleeding wounds of Saint Clement, will triumph in Heaven. You will\r\nremember them, my young Christian women, will you not, this day for\r\never, and will detest the infidel. You will be for ever faithful to\r\nthis God who is so great, so terrible, but so good?"\r\n\r\nWith these words the bishop rose authoritatively.\r\n\r\n"You promise me?" he said, lifting up his arm with an inspired air.\r\n\r\n"We promise," said the young girls melting into tears.\r\n\r\n"I accept your promise in the name of the terrible God," added the\r\nbishop in a thunderous voice, and the ceremony was at an end.\r\n\r\nThe king himself was crying. It was only a long time afterwards that\r\nJulien had sufficient self-possession to enquire "where were the bones\r\nof the Saint that had been sent from Rome to Philip the Good, Duke of\r\nBurgundy?" He was told that they were hidden in the charming waxen\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty deigned to allow the young ladies who had accompanied him\r\ninto the chapel to wear a red ribbon on which were embroidered these\r\nwords, "HATE OF THE INFIDEL. PERPETUAL ADORATION."\r\n\r\nMonsieur de la Mole had ten thousand bottles of wine distributed among\r\nthe peasants. In the evening at Verri\xc3\xa8res, the Liberals made a point of\r\nhaving illuminations which were a hundred times better than those of\r\nthe Royalists. Before leaving, the king paid a visit to M. de Moirod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHINKING PRODUCES SUFFERING\r\n\r\n\r\n    The grotesqueness of every-day events conceals the real\r\n           unhappiness of the passions.--_Barnave_.\r\n\r\nAs he was replacing the usual furniture in the room which M. de la\r\nMole had occupied, Julien found a piece of very strong paper folded in\r\nfour. He read at the bottom of the first page "To His Excellency M.\r\nle Marquis de la Mole, peer of France, Chevalier of the Orders of the\r\nKing, etc. etc." It was a petition in the rough hand-writing of a cook.\r\n\r\n        "Monsieur le Marquis, I have had religious principles\r\n        all my life. I was in Lyons exposed to the bombs at\r\n        the time of the siege, in \'93 of execrable memory. I\r\n        communicate, I go to Mass every Sunday in the parochial\r\n        church. I have never missed the paschal duty, even in\r\n        \'93 of execrable memory. My cook used to keep servants\r\n        before the revolution, my cook fasts on Fridays. I am\r\n        universally respected in Verri\xc3\xa8res, and I venture to\r\n        say I deserve to be so. I walk under the canopy in the\r\n        processions at the side of the cur\xc3\xa9 and of the mayor. On\r\n        great occasions I carry a big candle, bought at my own\r\n        expense.\r\n\r\n        "I ask Monsieur the marquis for the lottery appointment\r\n        of Verri\xc3\xa8res, which in one way or another is bound to\r\n        be vacant shortly as the beneficiary is very ill, and\r\n        moreover votes on the wrong side at elections, etc. De\r\n        Cholin."\r\n\r\nIn the margin of this petition was a recommendation signed "de Moirod"\r\nwhich began with this line, "I have had the honour, the worthy person\r\nwho makes this request."\r\n\r\n"So even that imbecile de Cholin shows me the way to go about things,"\r\nsaid Julien to himself.\r\n\r\nEight days after the passage of the King of ---- through Verri\xc3\xa8res,\r\nthe one question which predominated over the innumerable falsehoods,\r\nfoolish conjectures, and ridiculous discussions, etc., etc., which had\r\nhad successively for their object the king, the Marquis de la Mole,\r\nthe ten thousand bottles of wine, the fall of poor de Moirod, who,\r\nhoping to win a cross, only left his room a week after his fall, was\r\nthe absolute indecency of having _foisted_ Julien Sorel, a carpenter\'s\r\nson, into the Guard of Honour. You should have heard on this point the\r\nrich manufacturers of printed calico, the very persons who used to bawl\r\nthemselves hoarse in preaching equality, morning and evening in the\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9. That haughty woman, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, was of course responsible\r\nfor this abomination. The reason? The fine eyes and fresh complexion of\r\nthe little abb\xc3\xa9 Sorel explained everything else.\r\n\r\nA short time after their return to Vergy, Stanislas, the youngest of\r\nthe children, caught the fever; Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was suddenly attacked\r\nby an awful remorse. For the first time she reproached herself for her\r\nlove with some logic. She seemed to understand as though by a miracle\r\nthe enormity of the sin into which she had let herself be swept. Up to\r\nthat moment, although deeply religious, she had never thought of the\r\ngreatness of her crime in the eyes of God.\r\n\r\nIn former times she had loved God passionately in the Convent of\r\nthe Sacred Heart; in the present circumstances, she feared him with\r\nequal intensity. The struggles which lacerated her soul were all the\r\nmore awful in that her fear was quite irrational. Julien found that\r\nthe least argument irritated instead of soothing her. She saw in the\r\nillness the language of hell. Moreover, Julien was himself very fond of\r\nthe little Stanislas.\r\n\r\nIt soon assumed a serious character. Then incessant remorse deprived\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal of even her power of sleep. She ensconced herself in a\r\ngloomy silence: if she had opened her mouth, it would only have been to\r\nconfess her crime to God and mankind.\r\n\r\n"I urge you," said Julien to her, as soon as they got alone, "not to\r\nspeak to anyone. Let me be the sole confidant of your sufferings. If\r\nyou still love me, do not speak. Your words will not be able to take\r\naway our Stanislas\' fever." But his consolations produced no effect.\r\nHe did not know that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had got it into her head that, in\r\norder to appease the wrath of a jealous God, it was necessary either to\r\nhate Julien, or let her son die. It was because she felt she could not\r\nhate her lover that she was so unhappy.\r\n\r\n"Fly from me," she said one day to Julien. "In the name of God leave\r\nthis house. It is your presence here which kills my son. God punishes\r\nme," she added in a low voice. "He is just. I admire his fairness.\r\nMy crime is awful, and I was living without remorse," she exclaimed.\r\n"That was the first sign of my desertion of God: I ought to be doubly\r\npunished."\r\n\r\nJulien was profoundly touched. He could see in this neither hypocrisy\r\nnor exaggeration. "She thinks that she is killing her son by loving me,\r\nand all the same the unhappy woman loves me more than her son. I cannot\r\ndoubt it. It is remorse for that which is killing her. Those sentiments\r\nof hers have real greatness. But how could I have inspired such a love,\r\nI who am so poor, so badly-educated, so ignorant, and sometimes so\r\ncoarse in my manners?"\r\n\r\nOne night the child was extremely ill. At about two o\'clock in the\r\nmorning, M. de R\xc3\xaanal came to see it. The child consumed by fever, and\r\nextremely flushed, could not recognise its father. Suddenly Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal threw herself at her husband\'s feet; Julien saw that she was\r\ngoing to confess everything and ruin herself for ever.\r\n\r\nFortunately this extraordinary proceeding annoyed M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"Adieu! Adieu!" he said, going away.\r\n\r\n"No, listen to me," cried his wife on her knees before him, trying to\r\nhold him back. "Hear the whole truth. It is I who am killing my son. I\r\ngave him life, and I am taking it back. Heaven is punishing me. In the\r\neyes of God I am guilty of murder. It is necessary that I should ruin\r\nand humiliate myself. Perhaps that sacrifice will appease the the Lord."\r\n\r\nIf M. de R\xc3\xaanal had been a man of any imagination, he would then have\r\nrealized everything.\r\n\r\n"Romantic nonsense," he cried, moving his wife away as she tried to\r\nembrace his knees. "All that is romantic nonsense! Julien, go and fetch\r\nthe doctor at daybreak," and he went back to bed. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal fell\r\non her knees half-fainting, repelling Julien\'s help with a hysterical\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\nJulien was astonished.\r\n\r\n"So this is what adultery is," he said to himself. "Is it possible\r\nthat those scoundrels of priests should be right, that they who commit\r\nso many sins themselves should have the privilege of knowing the true\r\ntheory of sin? How droll!"\r\n\r\nFor twenty minutes after M. de R\xc3\xaanal had gone back to bed, Julien saw\r\nthe woman he loved with her head resting on her son\'s little bed,\r\nmotionless, and almost unconscious. "There," he said to himself, "is\r\na woman of superior temperament brought to the depths of unhappiness\r\nsimply because she has known me."\r\n\r\n"Time moves quickly. What can I do for her? I must make up my mind. I\r\nhave not got simply myself to consider now. What do I care for men and\r\ntheir buffooneries? What can I do for her? Leave her? But I should be\r\nleaving her alone and a prey to the most awful grief. That automaton\r\nof a husband is more harm to her than good. He is so coarse that he is\r\nbound to speak harshly to her. She may go mad and throw herself out of\r\nthe window."\r\n\r\n"If I leave her, if I cease to watch over her, she will confess\r\neverything, and who knows, in spite of the legacy which she is bound to\r\nbring him, he will create a scandal. She may confess everything (great\r\nGod) to that scoundrel of an abb\xc3\xa9 who makes the illness of a child\r\nof six an excuse for not budging from this house, and not without a\r\npurpose either. In her grief and her fear of God, she forgets all she\r\nknows of the man; she only sees the priest."\r\n\r\n"Go away," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal suddenly to him, opening her eyes.\r\n\r\n"I would give my life a thousand times to know what could be of most\r\nuse to you," answered Julien. "I have never loved you so much, my dear\r\nangel, or rather it is only from this last moment that I begin to adore\r\nyou as you deserve to be adored. What would become of me far from you,\r\nand with the consciousness that you are unhappy owing to what I have\r\ndone? But don\'t let my suffering come into the matter. I will go--yes,\r\nmy love! But if I leave you, dear; if I cease to watch over you, to be\r\nincessantly between you and your husband, you will tell him everything.\r\nYou will ruin yourself. Remember that he will hound you out of his\r\nhouse in disgrace. Besan\xc3\xa7on will talk of the scandal. You will be said\r\nto be absolutely in the wrong. You will never lift up your head again\r\nafter that shame."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I ask," she cried, standing up. "I shall suffer, so much\r\nthe better."\r\n\r\n"But you will also make him unhappy through that awful scandal."\r\n\r\n"But I shall be humiliating myself, throwing myself into the mire, and\r\nby those means, perhaps, I shall save my son. Such a humiliation in the\r\neyes of all is perhaps to be regarded as a public penitence. So far as\r\nmy weak judgment goes, is it not the greatest sacrifice that I can make\r\nto God?--perhaps He will deign to accept my humiliation, and to leave\r\nme my son. Show me another sacrifice which is more painful and I will\r\nrush to it."\r\n\r\n"Let me punish myself. I too am guilty. Do you wish me to retire to the\r\nTrappist Monastery? The austerity of that life may appease your God.\r\nOh, heaven, why cannot I take Stanislas\'s illness upon myself?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, do you love him then," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, getting up and\r\nthrowing herself in his arms.\r\n\r\nAt the same time she repelled him with horror.\r\n\r\n"I believe you! I believe you! Oh, my one friend," she cried falling on\r\nher knees again. "Why are you not the father of Stanislas? In that case\r\nit would not be a terrible sin to love you more than your son."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you allow me to stay and love you henceforth like a brother? It\r\nis the only rational atonement. It may appease the wrath of the Most\r\nHigh."\r\n\r\n"Am I," she cried, getting up and taking Julien\'s head between her two\r\nhands, and holding it some distance from her. "Am I to love you as if\r\nyou were a brother? Is it in my power to love you like that?" Julien\r\nmelted into tears.\r\n\r\n"I will obey you," he said, falling at her feet. "I will obey you in\r\nwhatever you order me. That is all there is left for me to do. My mind\r\nis struck with blindness. I do not see any course to take. If I leave\r\nyou you will tell your husband everything. You will ruin yourself\r\nand him as well. He will never be nominated deputy after incurring\r\nsuch ridicule. If I stay, you will think I am the cause of your son\'s\r\ndeath, and you will die of grief. Do you wish to try the effect of my\r\ndeparture. If you wish, I will punish myself for our sin by leaving you\r\nfor eight days. I will pass them in any retreat you like. In the abbey\r\nof Bray-le-Haut, for instance. But swear that you will say nothing to\r\nyour husband during my absence. Remember that if you speak I shall\r\nnever be able to come back."\r\n\r\nShe promised and he left, but was called back at the end of two days.\r\n\r\n"It is impossible for me to keep my oath without you. I shall speak to\r\nmy husband if you are not constantly there to enjoin me to silence by\r\nyour looks. Every hour of this abominable life seems to last a day."\r\n\r\nFinally heaven had pity on this unfortunate mother. Little by little\r\nStanislas got out of danger. But the ice was broken. Her reason had\r\nrealised the extent of her sin. She could not recover her equilibrium\r\nagain. Her pangs of remorse remained, and were what they ought to have\r\nbeen in so sincere a heart. Her life was heaven and hell: hell when she\r\ndid not see Julien; heaven when she was at his feet.\r\n\r\n"I do not deceive myself any more," she would say to him, even during\r\nthe moments when she dared to surrender herself to his full love. "I\r\nam damned, irrevocably damned. You are young, heaven may forgive you,\r\nbut I, I am damned. I know it by a certain sign. I am afraid, who would\r\nnot be afraid at the sight of hell? but at the bottom of my heart I\r\ndo not repent at all. I would commit my sin over again if I had the\r\nopportunity. If heaven will only forbear to punish me in this world and\r\nthrough my children, I shall have more than I deserve. But you, at any\r\nrate, my Julien," she would cry at other moments, "are you happy? Do\r\nyou think I love you enough?"\r\n\r\nThe suspiciousness and morbid pride of Julien, who needed, above all,\r\na self-sacrificing love, altogether vanished when he saw at every hour\r\nof the day so great and indisputable a sacrifice. He adored Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal. "It makes no difference her being noble, and my being a\r\nlabourer\'s son. She loves me.... she does not regard me as a valet\r\ncharged with the functions of a lover." That fear once dismissed,\r\nJulien fell into all the madness of love, into all its deadly\r\nuncertainties.\r\n\r\n"At any rate," she would cry, seeing his doubts of her love, "let me\r\nfeel quite happy during the three days we still have together. Let us\r\nmake haste; perhaps to-morrow will be too late. If heaven strikes me\r\nthrough my children, it will be in vain that I shall try only to live\r\nto love you, and to be blind to the fact that it is my crime which has\r\nkilled them. I could not survive that blow. Even if I wished I could\r\nnot; I should go mad."\r\n\r\n"Ah, if only I could take your sin on myself as you so generously\r\noffered to take Stanislas\' burning fever!"\r\n\r\nThis great moral crisis changed the character of the sentiment\r\nwhich united Julien and his mistress. His love was no longer simply\r\nadmiration for her beauty, and the pride of possessing her.\r\n\r\nHenceforth their happiness was of a quite superior character. The flame\r\nwhich consumed them was more intense. They had transports filled with\r\nmadness. Judged by the worldly standard their happiness would have\r\nappeared intensified. But they no longer found that delicious serenity,\r\nthat cloudless happiness, that facile joy of the first period of their\r\nlove, when Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s only fear was that Julien did not love her\r\nenough. Their happiness had at times the complexion of crime.\r\n\r\nIn their happiest and apparently their most tranquil moments, Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal would suddenly cry out, "Oh, great God, I see hell," as she\r\npressed Julien\'s hand with a convulsive grasp. "What horrible tortures!\r\nI have well deserved them." She grasped him and hung on to him like ivy\r\nonto a wall.\r\n\r\nJulien would try in vain to calm that agitated soul. She would take his\r\nhand, cover it with kisses. Then, relapsing into a gloomy reverie, she\r\nwould say, "Hell itself would be a blessing for me. I should still have\r\nsome days to pass with him on this earth, but hell on earth, the death\r\nof my children. Still, perhaps my crime will be forgiven me at that\r\nprice. Oh, great God, do not grant me my pardon at so great a price.\r\nThese poor children have in no way transgressed against You. I, I am\r\nthe only culprit. I love a man who is not my husband."\r\n\r\nJulien subsequently saw Madame de R\xc3\xaanal attain what were apparently\r\nmoments of tranquillity. She was endeavouring to control herself;\r\nshe did not wish to poison the life of the man she loved. They found\r\nthe days pass with the rapidity of lightning amid these alternating\r\nmoods of love, remorse, and voluptuousness. Julien lost the habit of\r\nreflecting.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Elisa went to attend to a little lawsuit which she had at\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res. She found Valenod very piqued against Julien. She hated the\r\ntutor and would often speak about him.\r\n\r\n"You will ruin me, Monsieur, if I tell the truth," she said one day to\r\nValenod. "All masters have an understanding amongst themselves with\r\nregard to matters of importance. There are certain disclosures which\r\npoor servants are never forgiven."\r\n\r\nAfter these stereotyped phrases, which his curiosity managed to cut\r\nshort, Monsieur Valenod received some information extremely mortifying\r\nto his self-conceit.\r\n\r\nThis woman, who was the most distinguished in the district, the woman\r\non whom he had lavished so much attention in the last six years, and\r\nmade no secret of it, more was the pity, this woman who was so proud,\r\nwhose disdain had put him to the blush times without number, had just\r\ntaken for her lover a little workman masquerading as a tutor. And to\r\nfill the cup of his jealousy, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal adored that lover.\r\n\r\n"And," added the housemaid with a sigh, "Julien did not put himself out\r\nat all to make his conquest, his manner was as cold as ever, even with\r\nMadame."\r\n\r\nElisa had only become certain in the country, but she believed that\r\nthis intrigue dated from much further back. "That is no doubt the\r\nreason," she added spitefully, "why he refused to marry me. And to\r\nthink what a fool I was when I went to consult Madame de R\xc3\xaanal and\r\nbegged her to speak to the tutor."\r\n\r\nThe very same evening, M. de R\xc3\xaanal received from the town, together\r\nwith his paper, a long anonymous letter which apprised him in the\r\ngreatest detail of what was taking place in his house. Julien saw him\r\npale as he read this letter written on blue paper, and look at him\r\nwith a malicious expression. During all that evening the mayor failed\r\nto throw off his trouble. It was in vain that Julien paid him court by\r\nasking for explanations about the genealogy of the best families in\r\nBurgundy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nANONYMOUS LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Do not give dalliance\r\n    Too much the rein; the strongest oaths are straw\r\n    To the fire i\' the blood.--_Tempest_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they left the drawing-room about midnight, Julien had time to say to\r\nhis love,\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let us see each other to-night. Your husband has suspicions. I\r\nwould swear that that big letter he read with a sigh was an anonymous\r\nletter."\r\n\r\nFortunately, Julien locked himself into his room. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had\r\nthe mad idea that this warning was only a pretext for not seeing her.\r\nShe absolutely lost her head, and came to his door at the accustomed\r\nhour. Julien, who had heard the noise in the corridor, immediately blew\r\nout his lamp. Someone was trying to open the door. Was it Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal? Was it a jealous husband?\r\n\r\nVery early next morning the cook, who liked Julien, brought him a book,\r\non the cover of which he read these words written in Italian: _Guardate\r\nalla pagina_ 130.\r\n\r\nJulien shuddered at the imprudence, looked for page 130, and found\r\npinned to it the following letter hastily written, bathed with tears,\r\nand full of spelling mistakes. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was usually very\r\ncorrect. He was touched by this circumstance, and somewhat forgot the\r\nawfulness of the indiscretion.\r\n\r\n        "So you did not want to receive me to-night? There are\r\n        moments when I think that I have never read down to the\r\n        depths of your soul. Your looks frighten me. I am afraid\r\n        of you. Great God! perhaps you have never loved me? In\r\n        that case let my husband discover my love, and shut me\r\n        up in a prison in the country far away from my children.\r\n        Perhaps God wills it so. I shall die soon, but you will\r\n        have proved yourself a monster.\r\n\r\n        "Do you not love me? Are you tired of my fits of folly\r\n        and of remorse, you wicked man? Do you wish to ruin me?\r\n        I will show you an easy way. Go and show this letter to\r\n        all Verri\xc3\xa8res, or rather show it to M. Valenod. Tell him\r\n        that I love you, nay, do not utter such a blasphemy,\r\n        tell him I adore you, that it was only on the day I saw\r\n        you that my life commenced; that even in the maddest\r\n        moments of my youth I never even dreamt of the happiness\r\n        that I owe to you, that I have sacrificed my life to\r\n        you and that I am sacrificing my soul. You know that\r\n        I am sacrificing much more. But does that man know\r\n        the meaning of sacrifice? Tell him, I say, simply to\r\n        irritate him, that I will defy all evil tongues, that\r\n        the only misfortune for me in the whole world would\r\n        be to witness any change in the only man who holds me\r\n        to life. What a happiness it would be to me to lose\r\n        my life, to offer it up as a sacrifice and to have no\r\n        longer any fear for my children.\r\n\r\n        "Have no doubt about it, dear one, if it is an\r\n        anonymous letter, it comes from that odious being who\r\n        has persecuted me for the last six years with his loud\r\n        voice, his stories about his jumps on horseback, his\r\n        fatuity, and the never ending catalogue of all his\r\n        advantages.\r\n\r\n        "Is there an anonymous letter? I should like to discuss\r\n        that question with you, you wicked man; but no, you\r\n        acted rightly. Clasping you in my arms perhaps for the\r\n        last time, I should never have been able to argue as\r\n        coldly as I do, now that I am alone. From this moment\r\n        our happiness will no longer be so easy. Will that be a\r\n        vexation for you? Yes, on those days when you haven\'t\r\n        received some amusing book from M. Fouqu\xc3\xa9. The sacrifice\r\n        is made; to-morrow, whether there is or whether there is\r\n        not any anonymous letter, I myself will tell my husband\r\n        I have received an anonymous letter and that it is\r\n        necessary to give you a golden bridge at once, find some\r\n        honourable excuse, and send you back to your parents\r\n        without delay.\r\n\r\n        "Alas, dear one, we are going to be separated for a\r\n        fortnight, perhaps a month! Go, I will do you justice,\r\n        you will suffer as much as I, but anyway, this is the\r\n        only means of disposing of this anonymous letter. It is\r\n        not the first that my husband has received, and on my\r\n        score too. Alas! how I used to laugh over them!\r\n\r\n        "My one aim is to make my husband think that the letter\r\n        comes from M. Valenod; I have no doubt that he is\r\n        its author. If you leave the house, make a point of\r\n        establishing yourself at Verri\xc3\xa8res; I will manage that\r\n        my husband should think of passing a fortnight there\r\n        in order to prove to the fools there was no coldness\r\n        between him and me. Once at Verri\xc3\xa8res, establish ties of\r\n        friendship with everyone, even with the Liberals. I am\r\n        sure that all their ladies will seek you out.\r\n\r\n        "Do not quarrel with M. Valenod, or cut off his ears,\r\n        as you said you would one day. Try, on the contrary, to\r\n        ingratiate yourself with him. The essential point is\r\n        that it should be notorious in Verri\xc3\xa8res that you are\r\n        going to enter the household either of Valenod or of\r\n        someone else to take charge of the children\'s education.\r\n\r\n        "That is what my husband will never put up with. If he\r\n        does feel bound to resign himself to it, well, at any\r\n        rate, you will be living in Verri\xc3\xa8res and I shall be\r\n        seeing you sometimes. My children, who love you so much,\r\n        will go and see you. Great God! I feel that I love my\r\n        children all the more because they love you. How is\r\n        all this going to end? I am wandering.... Anyway you\r\n        understand your line of conduct. Be nice, polite, but\r\n        not in any way disdainful to those coarse persons. I\r\n        ask you on my knees; they will be the arbiters of our\r\n        fate. Do not fear for a moment but that, so far as you\r\n        are concerned, my husband will conform to what public\r\n        opinion lays down for him.\r\n\r\n        "It is you who will supply me with the anonymous letter.\r\n        Equip yourself with patience and a pair of scissors, cut\r\n        out from a book the words which you will see, then stick\r\n        them with the mouth-glue on to the leaf of loose paper\r\n        which I am sending you. It comes to me from M. Valenod.\r\n        Be on your guard against a search in your room; burn the\r\n        pages of the book which you are going to mutilate. If\r\n        you do not find the words ready-made, have the patience\r\n        to form them letter by letter. I have made the anonymous\r\n        letter too short.\r\n\r\n\r\n        ANONYMOUS LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \'MADAME,\r\n\r\n        All your little goings-on are known, but the persons\r\n        interested in stopping have been warned. I have still\r\n        sufficient friendship left for you to urge you to cease\r\n        all relations with the little peasant. If you are\r\n        sensible enough to do this, your husband will believe\r\n        that the notification he has received is misleading, and\r\n        he will be left in his illusion. Remember that I have\r\n        your secret; tremble, unhappy woman, you must now _walk\r\n        straight_ before me.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n        "As soon as you have finished glueing together the\r\n        words that make up this letter (have you recognised the\r\n        director\'s special style of speech) leave the house, I\r\n        will meet you.\r\n\r\n        "I will go into the village and come back with a\r\n        troubled face. As a matter of fact I shall be very much\r\n        troubled. Great God! What a risk I run, and all because\r\n        you thought you guessed an anonymous letter. Finally,\r\n        looking very much upset, I shall give this letter to my\r\n        husband and say that an unknown man handed it to me. As\r\n        for you, go for a walk with the children, on the road to\r\n        the great woods, and do not come back before dinner-time.\r\n\r\n        "You will be able to see the tower of the dovecot from\r\n        the top of the rocks. If things go well for us, I\r\n        will place a white handkerchief there, in case of the\r\n        contrary, there will be nothing at all.\r\n\r\n        "Ungrateful man, will not your heart find out some means\r\n        of telling me that you love me before you leave for that\r\n        walk. Whatever happens, be certain of one thing: I shall\r\n        never survive our final separation by a single day.\r\n        Oh, you bad mother! but what is the use of my writing\r\n        those two words, dear Julien? I do not feel them, at\r\n        this moment I can only think of you. I have only written\r\n        them so as not to be blamed by you, but what is the good\r\n        of deception now that I find myself face to face with\r\n        losing you? Yes, let my soul seem monstrous to you,\r\n        but do not let me lie to the man whom I adore. I have\r\n        already deceived only too much in this life of mine. Go!\r\n        I forgive you if you love me no more. I have not the\r\n        time to read over my letter. It is a small thing in my\r\n        eyes to pay for the happy days that I have just passed\r\n        in your arms with the price of my life. You know that\r\n        they will cost me more."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nDIALOGUE WITH A MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\n     Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we;\r\n     For such as we are made of, such we be.--_Twelfth Night_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with a childish pleasure that for a whole hour Julien put the\r\nwords together. As he came out of his room, he met his pupils with\r\ntheir mother. She took the letter with a simplicity and a courage whose\r\ncalmness terrified him.\r\n\r\n"Is the mouth-glue dry enough yet?" she asked him.\r\n\r\n"And is this the woman who was so maddened by remorse?" he thought.\r\n"What are her plans at this moment?" He was too proud to ask her, but\r\nshe had never perhaps pleased him more.\r\n\r\n"If this turns out badly," she added with the same coolness, "I shall\r\nbe deprived of everything. Take charge of this, and bury it in some\r\nplace of the mountain. It will perhaps one day be my only resource."\r\n\r\nShe gave him a glass case in red morocco filled with gold and some\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\n"Now go," she said to him.\r\n\r\nShe kissed the children, embracing the youngest twice. Julien remained\r\nmotionless. She left him at a rapid pace without looking at him.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that M. de R\xc3\xaanal had opened the anonymous letter his\r\nlife had been awful. He had not been so agitated since a duel which he\r\nhad just missed having in 1816, and to do him justice, the prospect of\r\nreceiving a bullet would have made him less unhappy. He scrutinised the\r\nletter from every standpoint. "Is that not a woman\'s handwriting?" he\r\nsaid to himself. In that case, what woman had written it? He reviewed\r\nall those whom he knew at Verri\xc3\xa8res without being able to fix his\r\nsuspicions on any one. Could a man have dictated that letter? Who\r\nwas that man? Equal uncertainty on this point. The majority of his\r\nacquaintances were jealous of him, and, no doubt, hated him. "I must\r\nconsult my wife," he said to himself through habit, as he got up from\r\nthe arm-chair in which he had collapsed.\r\n\r\n"Great God!" he said aloud before he got up, striking his head, "it is\r\nshe above all of whom I must be distrustful. At the present moment she\r\nis my enemy," and tears came into his eyes through sheer anger.\r\n\r\nBy a poetic justice for that hardness of heart which constitutes the\r\nprovincial idea of shrewdness, the two men whom M. de R\xc3\xaanal feared the\r\nmost at the present moment were his two most intimate friends.\r\n\r\n"I have ten friends perhaps after those," and he passed them in review,\r\ngauging the degree of consolation which he could get from each one.\r\n"All of them, all of them," he exclaimed in a rage, "will derive the\r\nmost supreme pleasure from my awful experience."\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, he thought himself envied, and not without\r\nreason. Apart from his superb town mansion in which the king of ----\r\nhad recently spent the night, and thus conferred on it an enduring\r\nhonour, he had decorated his chateau at Vergy extremely well. The\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade was painted white and the windows adorned with fine green\r\nshutters. He was consoled for a moment by the thought of this\r\nmagnificence. The fact was that this ch\xc3\xa2teau was seen from three or\r\nfour leagues off, to the great prejudice of all the country houses or\r\nso-called ch\xc3\xa2teaux of the neighbourhood, which had been left in the\r\nhumble grey colour given them by time.\r\n\r\nThere was one of his friends on whose pity and whose tears M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\ncould count, the churchwarden of the parish; but he was an idiot who\r\ncried at everything. This man, however, was his only resource. "What\r\nunhappiness is comparable to mine," he exclaimed with rage. "What\r\nisolation!"\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?" said this truly pitiable man to himself. "Is it\r\npossible that I have no friend in my misfortune of whom I can ask\r\nadvice? for my mind is wandering, I feel it. Oh, Falcoz! oh, Ducros!"\r\nhe exclaimed with bitterness. Those were the names of two friends of\r\nhis childhood whom he had dropped owing to his snobbery in 1814. They\r\nwere not noble, and he had wished to change the footing of equality on\r\nwhich they had been living with him since their childhood.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Falcoz, a paper-merchant of Verri\xc3\xa8res, and a man of\r\nintellect and spirit, had bought a printing press in the chief town of\r\nthe department and undertaken the production of a journal. The priestly\r\ncongregation had resolved to ruin him; his journal had been condemned,\r\nand he had been deprived of his printer\'s diploma. In these sad\r\ncircumstances he ventured to write to M. de R\xc3\xaanal for the first time\r\nfor ten years. The mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res thought it his duty to answer\r\nin the old Roman style: "If the King\'s Minister were to do me the\r\nhonour of consulting me, I should say to him, ruin ruthlessly all the\r\nprovincial printers, and make printing a monopoly like tobacco." M. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal was horrified to remember the terms of this letter to an intimate\r\nfriend whom all Verri\xc3\xa8res had once admired, "Who would have said that\r\nI, with my rank, my fortune, my decorations, would ever come to regret\r\nit?" It was in these transports of rage, directed now against himself,\r\nnow against all his surroundings, that he passed an awful night; but,\r\nfortunately, it never occurred to him to spy on his wife.\r\n\r\n"I am accustomed to Louise," he said to himself, "she knows all my\r\naffairs. If I were free to marry to-morrow, I should not find anyone to\r\ntake her place." Then he began to plume himself on the idea that his\r\nwife was innocent. This point of view did not require any manifestation\r\nof character, and suited him much better. "How many calumniated women\r\nhas one not seen?"\r\n\r\n"But," he suddenly exclaimed, as he walked about feverishly, "shall I\r\nput up with her making a fool of me with her lover as though I were\r\na man of no account, some mere ragamuffin? Is all Verri\xc3\xa8res to make\r\nmerry over my complaisance? What have they not said about Charmier\r\n(he was a husband in the district who was notoriously deceived)? Was\r\nthere not a smile on every lip at the mention of his name? He is a good\r\nadvocate, but whoever said anything about his talent for speaking? \'Oh,\r\nCharmier,\' they say, \'Bernard\'s Charmier,\' he is thus designated by the\r\nname of the man who disgraces him."\r\n\r\n"I have no daughter, thank heaven," M. de R\xc3\xaanal would say at other\r\ntimes, "and the way in which I am going to punish the mother will\r\nconsequently not be so harmful to my children\'s household. I could\r\nsurprise this little peasant with my wife and kill them both; in that\r\ncase the tragedy of the situation would perhaps do away with the\r\ngrotesque element." This idea appealed to him. He followed it up in all\r\nits details. "The penal code is on my side, and whatever happens our\r\ncongregation and my friends on the jury will save me." He examined his\r\nhunting-knife which was quite sharp, but the idea of blood frightened\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I could thrash this insolent tutor within an inch of his life and\r\nhound him out of the house; but what a sensation that would make in\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res and even over the whole department! After Falcoz\' journal had\r\nbeen condemned, and when its chief editor left prison, I had a hand\r\nin making him lose his place of six hundred francs a year. They say\r\nthat this scribbler has dared to show himself again in Besan\xc3\xa7on. He\r\nmay lampoon me adroitly and in such a way that it will be impossible\r\nto bring him up before the courts. Bring him up before the courts!\r\nThe insolent wretch will insinuate in a thousand and one ways that he\r\nhas spoken the truth. A well-born man who keeps his place like I do,\r\nis hated by all the plebeians. I shall see my name in all those awful\r\nParis papers. Oh, my God, what depths. To see the ancient name of\r\nR\xc3\xaanal plunged in the mire of ridicule. If I ever travel I shall have\r\nto change my name. What! abandon that name which is my glory and my\r\nstrength. Could anything be worse than that?\r\n\r\n"If I do not kill my wife but turn her out in disgrace, she has her\r\naunt in Besan\xc3\xa7on who is going to hand all her fortune over to her.\r\nMy wife will go and live in Paris with Julien. It will be known at\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res, and I shall be taken for a dupe." The unhappy man then\r\nnoticed from the paleness of the lamplight that the dawn was beginning\r\nto appear. He went to get a little fresh air in the garden. At this\r\nmoment he had almost determined to make no scandal, particularly in\r\nview of the fact that a scandal would overwhelm with joy all his good\r\nfriends in Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\nThe promenade in the garden calmed him a little. "No," he exclaimed,\r\n"I shall not deprive myself of my wife, she is too useful to me." He\r\nimagined with horror what his house would be without his wife. The only\r\nrelative he had was the Marquise of R---- old, stupid, and malicious.\r\n\r\nA very sensible idea occurred to him, but its execution required a\r\nstrength of character considerably superior to the small amount of\r\ncharacter which the poor man possessed. "If I keep my wife," he said\r\nto himself, "I know what I shall do one day; on some occasion when\r\nshe makes me lose patience, I shall reproach her with her guilt. She\r\nis proud, we shall quarrel, and all this will happen before she has\r\ninherited her aunt\'s fortune. And how they will all make fun of me\r\nthen! My wife loves her children, the result will be that everything\r\nwill go to them. But as for me, I shall be the laughing-stock of\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res. \'What,\' they will say, \'he could not even manage to revenge\r\nhimself on his wife!\' Would it not be better to leave it and verify\r\nnothing? In that case I tie my hands, and cannot afterwards reproach\r\nher with anything."\r\n\r\nAn instant afterwards M. de R\xc3\xaanal, once more a prey to wounded vanity,\r\nset himself laboriously to recollect all the methods of procedure\r\nmentioned in the billiard-room of the _Casino_ or the _Nobles\' Club_ in\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res, when some fine talker interrupted the pool to divert himself\r\nat the expense of some deceived husband. How cruel these pleasantries\r\nappeared to him at the present moment!\r\n\r\n"My God, why is my wife not dead! then I should be impregnable against\r\nridicule. Why am I not a widower? I should go and pass six months in\r\nParis in the best society. After this moment of happiness occasioned\r\nby the idea of widowerhood, his imagination reverted to the means of\r\nassuring himself of the truth. Should he put a slight layer of bran\r\nbefore the door of Julien\'s room at midnight after everyone had gone to\r\nbed? He would see the impression of the feet in the following morning.\r\n\r\n"But that\'s no good," he suddenly exclaimed with rage. "That\r\ninquisitive Elisa will notice it, and they will soon know all over the\r\nhouse that I am jealous."\r\n\r\nIn another _Casino_ tale a husband had assured himself of his\r\nmisfortune by tying a hair with a little wax so that it shut the door\r\nof the gallant as effectually as a seal.\r\n\r\nAfter so many hours of uncertainty this means of clearing up his fate\r\nseemed to him emphatically the best, and he was thinking of availing\r\nhimself of it when, in one of the turnings of the avenue he met the\r\nvery woman whom he would like to have seen dead. She was coming back\r\nfrom the village. She had gone to hear mass in the church of Vergy.\r\nA tradition, extremely doubtful in the eyes of the cold philosopher,\r\nbut in which she believed, alleges that the little church was once the\r\nchapel of the ch\xc3\xa2teau of the Lord of Vergy. This idea obsessed Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal all the time in the church that she had counted on spending in\r\nprayer. She kept on imagining to herself the spectacle of her husband\r\nkilling Julien when out hunting as though by accident, and then making\r\nher eat his heart in the evening.\r\n\r\n"My fate," she said to herself, "depends on what he will think when\r\nhe listens to me. It may be I shall never get another opportunity\r\nof speaking to him after this fatal quarter of an hour. He is not a\r\nreasonable person who is governed by his intellect. In that case, with\r\nthe help of my weak intelligence, I could anticipate what he will do or\r\nsay. He will decide our common fate. He has the power. But this fate\r\ndepends on my adroitness, on my skill in directing the ideas of this\r\ncrank, who is blinded by his rage and unable to see half of what takes\r\nplace. Great God! I need talent and coolness, where shall I get it?"\r\n\r\nShe regained her calmness as though by magic, and she entered the\r\ngarden and saw her husband in the distance. His dishevelled hair and\r\ndisordered dress showed that he had not slept.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a letter with a broken seal but folded. As for him,\r\nwithout opening it, he gazed at his wife with the eyes of a madman.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s an abominable thing," she said to him, "which an evil-looking\r\nman who makes out that he knows you and is under an obligation to you,\r\nhanded to me as I was passing behind the notary\'s garden. I insist on\r\none thing and that is that you send back this M. Julien to his parents\r\nand without delay." Madame de R\xc3\xaanal hastened to say these words,\r\nperhaps a little before the psychological moment, in order to free\r\nherself from the awful prospect of having to say them.\r\n\r\nShe was seized with joy on seeing that which she was occasioning to her\r\nhusband. She realised from the fixed stare which he was rivetting on\r\nher that Julien had surmised rightly.\r\n\r\n"What a genius he is to be so brilliantly diplomatic instead of\r\nsuccumbing to so real a misfortune," she thought. "He will go very far\r\nin the future! Alas, his successes will only make him forget me."\r\n\r\nThis little act of admiration for the man whom she adored quite cured\r\nher of her trouble.\r\n\r\nShe congratulated herself on her tactics. "I have not been unworthy of\r\nJulien," she said to herself with a sweet and secret pleasure.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal kept examining the second anonymous letter which the\r\nreader may remember was composed of printed words glued on to a paper\r\nverging on blue. He did not say a word for fear of giving himself away.\r\n"They still make fun of me in every possible way," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nto himself, overwhelmed with exhaustion. "Still more new insults to\r\nexamine and all the time on account of my wife." He was on the point\r\nof heaping on her the coarsest insults. He was barely checked by the\r\nprospects of the Besan\xc3\xa7on legacy. Consumed by the need of venting his\r\nfeelings on something, he crumpled up the paper of the second anonymous\r\nletter and began to walk about with huge strides. He needed to get\r\naway from his wife. A few moments afterwards he came back to her in a\r\nquieter frame of mind.\r\n\r\n"The thing is to take some definite line and send Julien away," she\r\nsaid immediately, "after all it is only a labourer\'s son. You will\r\ncompensate him by a few crowns and besides he is clever and will easily\r\nmanage to find a place, with M. Valenod for example, or with the\r\nsub-prefect De Maugiron who both have children. In that way you will\r\nnot be doing him any wrong...." "There you go talking like the fool\r\nthat you are," exclaimed M. de R\xc3\xaanal in a terrible voice. "How can one\r\nhope that a woman will show any good sense? You never bother yourself\r\nabout common sense. How can you ever get to know anything? Your\r\nindifference and your idleness give you no energy except for hunting\r\nthose miserable butterflies, which we are unfortunate to have in our\r\nhouses."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal let him speak and he spoke for a long time. _He was\r\nworking off his anger_, to use the local expression.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," she answered him at last, "I speak as a woman who has\r\nbeen outraged in her honour, that is to say, in what she holds most\r\nprecious."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal preserved an unalterable sang-froid during all this\r\npainful conversation on the result of which depended the possibility of\r\nstill living under the same roof as Julien. She sought for the ideas\r\nwhich she thought most adapted to guide her husband\'s blind anger\r\ninto a safe channel. She had been insensible to all the insulting\r\nimputations which he had addressed to her. She was not listening to\r\nthem, she was then thinking about Julien. "Will he be pleased with me?"\r\n\r\n"This little peasant whom we have loaded with attentions, and even with\r\npresents, may be innocent," she said to him at last, "but he is none\r\nthe less the occasion of the first affront that I have ever received.\r\nMonsieur, when I read this abominable paper, I vowed to myself that\r\neither he or I should leave your house."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to make a scandal so as to dishonour me and yourself as\r\nwell? You will make things hum in Verri\xc3\xa8res I can assure you."\r\n\r\n"It is true, the degree of prosperity in which your prudent management\r\nhas succeeded in placing you yourself, your family and the town is the\r\nsubject of general envy.... Well, I will urge Julien to ask you for\r\na holiday to go and spend the month with that wood-merchant of the\r\nmountains, a fit friend to be sure for this little labourer."\r\n\r\n"Mind you do nothing at all," resumed M. de R\xc3\xaanal with a fair amount of\r\ntranquillity. "I particularly insist on your not speaking to him. You\r\nwill put him into a temper and make him quarrel with me. You know to\r\nwhat extent this little gentleman is always spoiling for a quarrel."\r\n\r\n"That young man has no tact," resumed Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. "He may be\r\nlearned, you know all about that, but at bottom he is only a peasant.\r\nFor my own part I never thought much of him since he refused to\r\nmarry Elisa. It was an assured fortune; and that on the pretext that\r\nsometimes she had made secret visits to M. Valenod."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal, lifting up his eyebrows inordinately. "What,\r\ndid Julien tell you that?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly, he always talked of the vocation which calls him to the\r\nholy ministry, but believe me, the first vocation for those lower-class\r\npeople is getting their bread and butter. He gave me to understand that\r\nhe was quite aware of her secret visits."\r\n\r\n"And I--I was ignorant," exclaimed M. de R\xc3\xaanal, growing as angry as\r\nbefore and accentuating his words. "Things take place in my house which\r\nI know nothing about.... What! has there been anything between Elisa\r\nand Valenod?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s old history, my dear," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal with a smile,\r\n"and perhaps no harm has come of it. It was at the time when your good\r\nfriend Valenod would not have minded their thinking at Verri\xc3\xa8res that a\r\nperfectly platonic little affection was growing up between him and me."\r\n\r\n"I had that idea once myself," exclaimed M. de R\xc3\xaanal, furiously\r\nstriking his head as he progressed from discovery to discovery, "and\r\nyou told me nothing about it."\r\n\r\n"Should one set two friends by the ears on account of a little fit of\r\nvanity on the part of our dear director? What society woman has not had\r\naddressed to her a few letters which were both extremely witty and even\r\na little gallant?"\r\n\r\n"He has written to you?"\r\n\r\n"He writes a great deal."\r\n\r\n"Show me those letters at once, I order you," and M. de R\xc3\xaanal pulled\r\nhimself up to his six feet.\r\n\r\n"I will do nothing of the kind," he was answered with a sweetness\r\nverging on indifference. "I will show you them one day when you are in\r\na better frame of mind."\r\n\r\n"This very instant, odds life," exclaimed M. de R\xc3\xaanal, transported with\r\nrage and yet happier than he had been for twelve hours.\r\n\r\n"Will you swear to me," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal quite gravely, "never to\r\nquarrel with the director of the workhouse about these letters?"\r\n\r\n"Quarrel or no quarrel, I can take those foundlings away from him,\r\nbut," he continued furiously, "I want those letters at once. Where are\r\nthey?"\r\n\r\n"In a drawer in my secretary, but I shall certainly not give you the\r\nkey."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll manage to break it," he cried, running towards his wife\'s room.\r\n\r\nHe did break in fact with a bar of iron a costly secretary of veined\r\nmahogany which came from Paris and which he had often been accustomed\r\nto wipe with the nap of his coat, when he thought he had detected a\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal had climbed up at a run the hundred and twenty steps\r\nof the dovecot. She tied the corner of a white handkerchief to one of\r\nthe bars of iron of the little window. She was the happiest of women.\r\nWith tears in her eyes she looked towards the great mountain forest.\r\n"Doubtless," she said to herself, "Julien is watching for this happy\r\nsignal."\r\n\r\nShe listened attentively for a long time and then she cursed the\r\nmonotonous noise of the grasshopper and the song of the birds. "Had it\r\nnot been for that importunate noise, a cry of joy starting from the big\r\nrocks could have arrived here." Her greedy eye devoured that immense\r\nslope of dark verdure which was as level as a meadow.\r\n\r\n"Why isn\'t he clever enough," she said to herself, quite overcome, "to\r\ninvent some signal to tell me that his happiness is equal to mine?" She\r\nonly came down from the dovecot when she was frightened of her husband\r\ncoming there to look for her.\r\n\r\nShe found him furious. He was perusing the soothing phrases of M. de\r\nValenod and reading them with an emotion to which they were but little\r\nused.\r\n\r\n"I always come back to the same idea," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal seizing\r\na moment when a pause in her husband\'s ejaculations gave her the\r\npossibility of getting heard. "It is necessary for Julien to travel.\r\nWhatever talent he may have for Latin, he is only a peasant after all,\r\noften coarse and lacking in tact. Thinking to be polite, he addresses\r\ninflated compliments to me every day, which are in bad taste. He learns\r\nthem by heart out of some novel or other."\r\n\r\n"He never reads one," exclaimed M. de R\xc3\xaanal. "I am assured of it. Do\r\nyou think that I am the master of a house who is so blind as to be\r\nignorant of what takes place in his own home."\r\n\r\n"Well, if he doesn\'t read these droll compliments anywhere, he invents\r\nthem, and that\'s all the worse so far as he is concerned. He must have\r\ntalked about me in this tone in Verri\xc3\xa8res and perhaps without going so\r\nfar," said Madame R\xc3\xaanal with the idea of making a discovery, "he may\r\nhave talked in the same strain to Elisa, which is almost the same as if\r\nhe had said it to M. Valenod."\r\n\r\n"Ah," exclaimed M. de R\xc3\xaanal, shaking the table and the room with one of\r\nthe most violent raps ever made by a human fist. "The anonymous printed\r\nletter and Valenod\'s letters are written on the same paper."\r\n\r\n"At last," thought Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. She pretended to be overwhelmed\r\nat this discovery, and without having the courage to add a single\r\nword, went and sat down some way off on the divan at the bottom of the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the battle was won. She had a great deal of trouble in\r\npreventing M. de R\xc3\xaanal from going to speak to the supposed author of\r\nthe anonymous letter. "What, can\'t you see that making a scene with M.\r\nValenod without sufficient proof would be the most signal mistake? You\r\nare envied, Monsieur, and who is responsible? Your talents: your wise\r\nmanagement, your tasteful buildings, the dowry which I have brought\r\nyou, and above all, the substantial legacy which we are entitled to\r\nhope for from my good aunt, a legacy, the importance of which is\r\ninordinately exaggerated, have made you into the first person in\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res."\r\n\r\n"You are forgetting my birth," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal, smiling a little.\r\n\r\n"You are one of the most distinguished gentlemen in the province,"\r\nreplied Madame de R\xc3\xaanal emphatically. "If the king were free and could\r\ngive birth its proper due, you would no doubt figure in the Chamber of\r\nPeers, etc. And being in this magnificent position, you yet wish to\r\ngive the envious a fact to take hold of."\r\n\r\n"To speak about this anonymous letter to M. Valenod is equivalent\r\nto proclaiming over the whole of Verri\xc3\xa8res, nay, over the whole of\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on, over the whole province that this little bourgeois who has\r\nbeen admitted perhaps imprudently to intimacy _with a R\xc3\xaanal_, has\r\nmanaged to offend him. At the time when those letters which you have\r\njust taken prove that I have reciprocated M. Valenod\'s love, you ought\r\nto kill me. I should have deserved it a hundred times over, but not to\r\nshow him your anger. Remember that all our neighbours are only waiting\r\nfor an excuse to revenge themselves for your superiority. Remember that\r\nin 1816 you had a hand in certain arrests.\r\n\r\n"I think that you show neither consideration nor love for me,"\r\nexclaimed M. de R\xc3\xaanal with all the bitterness evoked by such a memory,\r\n"and I was not made a peer."\r\n\r\n"I am thinking, my dear," resumed Madame de R\xc3\xaanal with a smile, "that\r\nI shall be richer than you are, that I have been your companion for\r\ntwelve years, and that by virtue of those qualifications I am entitled\r\nto have a voice in the council and, above all, in to-day\'s business. If\r\nyou prefer M. Julien to me," she added, with a touch of temper which\r\nwas but thinly disguised, "I am ready to go and pass a winter with my\r\naunt." These words proved a lucky shot. They possessed a firmness which\r\nendeavoured to clothe itself with courtesy. It decided M. de R\xc3\xaanal, but\r\nfollowing the provincial custom, he still thought for a long time, and\r\nwent again over all his arguments; his wife let him speak. There was\r\nstill a touch of anger in his intonation. Finally two hours of futile\r\nrant exhausted the strength of a man who had been subject during the\r\nwhole night to a continuous fit of anger. He determined on the line of\r\nconduct he was going to follow with regard to M. Valenod, Julien and\r\neven Elisa.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was on the point once or twice during this great scene\r\nof feeling some sympathy for the very real unhappiness of the man\r\nwho had been so dear to her for twelve years. But true passions are\r\nselfish. Besides she was expecting him every instant to mention the\r\nanonymous letter which he had received the day before and he did not\r\nmention it. In order to feel quite safe, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal wanted to know\r\nthe ideas which the letter had succeeding in suggesting to the man on\r\nwhom her fate depended, for, in the provinces the husbands are the\r\nmasters of public opinion. A husband who complains covers himself with\r\nridicule, an inconvenience which becomes no less dangerous in France\r\nwith each succeeding year; but if he refuses to provide his wife with\r\nmoney, she falls to the status of a labouring woman at fifteen sous a\r\nday, while the virtuous souls have scruples about employing her.\r\n\r\nAn odalisque in the seraglio can love the Sultan with all her might.\r\nHe is all-powerful and she has no hope of stealing his authority by\r\na series of little subtleties. The master\'s vengeance is terrible\r\nand bloody but martial and generous; a dagger thrust finishes\r\neverything. But it is by stabbing her with public contempt that a\r\nnineteenth-century husband kills his wife. It is by shutting against\r\nher the doors of all the drawing-rooms.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame de R\xc3\xaanal returned to her room, her feeling of danger was\r\nvividly awakened. She was shocked by the disorder in which she found\r\nit. The locks of all the pretty little boxes had been broken. Many\r\nplanks in the floor had been lifted up. "He would have no pity on me,"\r\nshe said to herself. "To think of his spoiling like this, this coloured\r\nwood floor which he likes so much; he gets red with rage whenever one\r\nof his children comes into it with wet shoes, and now it is spoilt for\r\never." The spectacle of this violence immediately banished the last\r\nscruples which she was entertaining with respect to that victory which\r\nshe had won only too rapidly.\r\n\r\nJulien came back with the children a little before the dinner-bell.\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal said to him very drily at dessert when the servant had\r\nleft the room:\r\n\r\n"You have told me about your wish to go and spend a fortnight at\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res. M. de R\xc3\xaanal is kind enough to give you a holiday. You can\r\nleave as soon as you like, but the childrens\' exercises will be sent to\r\nyou every day so that they do not waste their time."\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly not allow you more than a week," said M. de R\xc3\xaanal in\r\na very bitter tone. Julien thought his visage betrayed the anxiety of a\r\nman who was seriously harassed.\r\n\r\n"He has not yet decided what line to take," he said to his love during\r\na moment when they were alone together in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal rapidly recounted to him all she had done since the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"The details are for to-night," she added with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Feminine perversity," thought Julien, "What can be the pleasure, what\r\ncan be the instinct which induces them to deceive us."\r\n\r\n"I think you are both enlightened and at the same time blinded by your\r\nlove," he said to her with some coldness. "Your conduct to-day has been\r\nadmirable, but is it prudent for us to try and see each other to-night?\r\nThis house is paved with enemies. Just think of Elisa\'s passionate\r\nhatred for me."\r\n\r\n"That hate is very like the passionate indifference which you no doubt\r\nhave for me."\r\n\r\n"Even if I were indifferent I ought to save you from the peril in which\r\nI have plunged you. If chance so wills it that M. de R\xc3\xaanal should speak\r\nto Elisa, she can acquaint him with everything in a single word. What\r\nis to prevent him from hiding near my room fully armed?"\r\n\r\n"What, not even courage?" said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, with all the\r\nhaughtiness of a scion of nobility.\r\n\r\n"I will never demean myself to speak about my courage," said Julien,\r\ncoldly, "it would be mean to do so. Let the world judge by the facts.\r\nBut," he added, taking her hand, "you have no idea how devoted I am to\r\nyou and how over-joyed I am of being able to say good-bye to you before\r\nthis cruel separation."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nMANNERS OF PROCEDURE IN 1830\r\n\r\n\r\n     Speech has been given to man to conceal his thought.\r\n                                             _R.P. Malagrida_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien had scarcely arrived at Verri\xc3\xa8res before he reproached himself\r\nwith his injustice towards Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. "I should have despised\r\nher for a weakling of a woman if she had not had the strength to go\r\nthrough with her scene with M. de R\xc3\xaanal. But she has acquitted herself\r\nlike a diplomatist and I sympathise with the defeat of the man who is\r\nmy enemy. There is a bourgeois prejudice in my action; my vanity is\r\noffended because M. de R\xc3\xaanal is a man. Men form a vast and illustrious\r\nbody to which I have the honour to belong. I am nothing but a fool." M.\r\nCh\xc3\xa9lan had refused the magnificent apartments which the most important\r\nLiberals in the district had offered him, when his loss of his living\r\nhad necessitated his leaving the parsonage. The two rooms which he had\r\nrented were littered with his books. Julien, wishing to show Verri\xc3\xa8res\r\nwhat a priest could do, went and fetched a dozen pinewood planks from\r\nhis father, carried them on his back all along the Grande-Rue, borrowed\r\nsome tools from an old comrade and soon built a kind of book-case in\r\nwhich he arranged M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan\'s books.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were corrupted by the vanity of the world," said the\r\nold man to him as he cried with joy, "but this is something which well\r\nredeems all the childishness of that brilliant Guard of Honour uniform\r\nwhich has made you so many enemies."\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal had ordered Julien to stay at his house. No one suspected\r\nwhat had taken place. The third day after his arrival Julien saw no\r\nless a personage than M. the sub-prefect de Maugiron come all the way\r\nup the stairs to his room. It was only after two long hours of fatuous\r\ngossip and long-winded lamentations about the wickedness of man, the\r\nlack of honesty among the people entrusted with the administration\r\nof the public funds, the dangers of his poor France, etc. etc., that\r\nJulien was at last vouchsafed a glimpse of the object of the visit.\r\nThey were already on the landing of the staircase and the poor half\r\ndisgraced tutor was escorting with all proper deference the future\r\nprefect of some prosperous department, when the latter was pleased to\r\ntake an interest in Julien\'s fortune, to praise his moderation in money\r\nmatters, etc., etc. Finally M. de Maugiron, embracing him in the most\r\npaternal way, proposed that he should leave M. de R\xc3\xaanal and enter the\r\nhousehold of an official who had children to educate and who, like King\r\nPhilippe, thanked Heaven not so much that they had been granted to him,\r\nbut for the fact that they had been born in the same neighbourhood as\r\nM. Julien. Their tutor would enjoy a salary of 800 francs, payable\r\nnot from month to month, which is not at all aristocratic, said M. de\r\nMaugiron, but quarterly and always in advance.\r\n\r\nIt was Julien\'s turn now. After he had been bored for an hour and a\r\nhalf by waiting for what he had to say, his answer was perfect and,\r\nabove all, as long as a bishop\'s charge. It suggested everything and\r\nyet said nothing clearly. It showed at the same time respect for M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal, veneration for the public of Verri\xc3\xa8res and gratitude to the\r\ndistinguished sub-prefect. The sub-prefect, astonished at finding\r\nhim more Jesuitical than himself, tried in vain to obtain something\r\ndefinite. Julien was delighted, seized the opportunity to practise, and\r\nstarted his answer all over again in different language. Never has an\r\neloquent minister who wished to make the most of the end of a session\r\nwhen the Chamber really seemed desirous of waking up, said less in more\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nM. de Maugiron had scarcely left before Julien began to laugh like\r\na madman. In order to exploit his Jesuitical smartness, he wrote a\r\nnine-page letter to M. de R\xc3\xaanal in which he gave him an account of all\r\nthat had been said to him and humbly asked his advice. "But the old\r\nscoundrel has not told me the name of the person who is making the\r\noffer. It is bound to be M. Valenod who, no doubt, sees in my exile at\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res the result of his anonymous letter."\r\n\r\nHaving sent off his despatch and feeling as satisfied as a hunter who\r\nat six o\'clock in the morning on a fine autumn day, comes out into\r\na plain that abounds with game, he went out to go and ask advice of\r\nM. Ch\xc3\xa9lan. But before he had arrived at the good cur\xc3\xa9\'s, providence,\r\nwishing to shower favours upon him, threw in his path M. de Valenod,\r\nto whom he owned quite freely that his heart was torn in two; a poor\r\nlad such as he was owed an exclusive devotion to the vocation to which\r\nit had pleased Heaven to call him. But vocation was not everything in\r\nthis base world. In order to work worthily at the vine of the Lord,\r\nand to be not totally unworthy of so many worthy colleagues, it was\r\nnecessary to be educated; it was necessary to spend two expensive years\r\nat the seminary of Besan\xc3\xa7on; saving consequently became an imperative\r\nnecessity, and was certainly much easier with a salary of eight hundred\r\nfrancs paid quarterly than with six hundred francs which one received\r\nmonthly. On the other hand, did not Heaven, by placing him by the side\r\nof the young de R\xc3\xaanals, and especially by inspiring him with a special\r\ndevotion to them, seem to indicate that it was not proper to abandon\r\nthat education for another one.\r\n\r\nJulien reached such a degree of perfection in that particular kind of\r\neloquence which has succeeded the drastic quickness of the empire, that\r\nhe finished by boring himself with the sound of his own words.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home he found a valet of M. Valenod in full livery who had\r\nbeen looking for him all over the town, with a card inviting him to\r\ndinner for that same day.\r\n\r\nJulien had never been in that man\'s house. Only a few days before\r\nhe had been thinking of nothing but the means of giving him a sound\r\nthrashing without getting into trouble with the police. Although\r\nthe time of the dinner was one o\'clock, Julien thought it was more\r\ndeferential to present himself at half-past twelve at the office of M.\r\nthe director of the workhouse. He found him parading his importance in\r\nthe middle of a lot of despatch boxes. His large black whiskers, his\r\nenormous quantity of hair, his Greek bonnet placed across the top of\r\nhis head, his immense pipe, his embroidered slippers, the big chains\r\nof gold crossed all over his breast, and the whole stock-in-trade of\r\na provincial financier who considers himself prosperous, failed to\r\nimpose on Julien in the least: They only made him think the more of the\r\nthrashing which he owed him.\r\n\r\nHe asked for the honour of being introduced to Madame Valenod. She\r\nwas dressing and was unable to receive him. By way of compensation he\r\nhad the privilege of witnessing the toilet of M. the director of the\r\nworkhouse. They subsequently went into the apartment of Madame Valenod,\r\nwho introduced her children to him with tears in her eyes. This lady\r\nwas one of the most important in Verri\xc3\xa8res, had a big face like a\r\nman\'s, on which she had put rouge in honour of this great function. She\r\ndisplayed all the maternal pathos of which she was capable.\r\n\r\nJulien thought all the time of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. His distrust made him\r\nonly susceptible to those associations which are called up by their\r\nopposites, but he was then affected to the verge of breaking down.\r\nThis tendency was increased by the sight of the house of the director\r\nof the workhouse. He was shown over it. Everything in it was new and\r\nmagnificent, and he was told the price of every article of furniture.\r\nBut Julien detected a certain element of sordidness, which smacked of\r\nstolen money into the bargain. Everybody in it, down to the servants,\r\nhad the air of setting his face in advance against contempt.\r\n\r\nThe collector of taxes, the superintendent of indirect taxes, the\r\nofficer of gendarmerie, and two or three other public officials arrived\r\nwith their wives. They were followed by some rich Liberals. Dinner was\r\nannounced. It occurred to Julien, who was already feeling upset, that\r\nthere were some poor prisoners on the other side of the dining-room\r\nwall, and that an illicit profit had perhaps been made over their\r\nrations of meat in order to purchase all that garish luxury with which\r\nthey were trying to overwhelm him.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they are hungry at this very minute," he said to himself. He\r\nfelt a choking in his throat. He found it impossible to eat and almost\r\nimpossible to speak. Matters became much worse a quarter of an hour\r\nafterwards; they heard in the distance some refrains of a popular song\r\nthat was, it must be confessed, a little vulgar, which was being sung\r\nby one of the inmates. M. Valenod gave a look to one of his liveried\r\nservants who disappeared and soon there was no more singing to be\r\nheard. At that moment a valet offered Julien some Rhine wine in a green\r\nglass and Madame Valenod made a point of asking him to note that this\r\nwine cost nine francs a bottle in the market. Julien held up his green\r\nglass and said to M. Valenod,\r\n\r\n"They are not singing that wretched song any more."\r\n\r\n"Zounds, I should think not," answered the triumphant governor. "I have\r\nmade the rascals keep quiet."\r\n\r\nThese words were too much for Julien. He had the manners of his new\r\nposition, but he had not yet assimilated its spirit. In spite of all\r\nhis hypocrisy and its frequent practice, he felt a big tear drip down\r\nhis cheek.\r\n\r\nHe tried to hide it in the green glass, but he found it absolutely\r\nimpossible to do justice to the Rhine wine. "Preventing singing he said\r\nto himself: Oh, my God, and you suffer it."\r\n\r\nFortunately nobody noticed his ill-bred emotion. The collector of\r\ntaxes had struck up a royalist song. "So this," reflected Julien\'s\r\nconscience during the hubbub of the refrain which was sung in chorus,\r\n"is the sordid prosperity which you will eventually reach, and you will\r\nonly enjoy it under these conditions and in company like this. You\r\nwill, perhaps, have a post worth twenty thousand francs; but while you\r\ngorge yourself on meat, you will have to prevent a poor prisoner from\r\nsinging; you will give dinners with the money which you have stolen out\r\nof his miserable rations and during your dinners he will be still more\r\nwretched. Oh, Napoleon, how sweet it was to climb to fortune in your\r\nway through the dangers of a battle, but to think of aggravating the\r\npain of the unfortunate in this cowardly way."\r\n\r\nI own that the weakness which Julien had been manifesting in this\r\nsoliloquy gives me a poor opinion of him. He is worthy of being the\r\naccomplice of those kid-gloved conspirators who purport to change the\r\nwhole essence of a great country\'s existence, without wishing to have\r\non their conscience the most trivial scratch.\r\n\r\nJulien was sharply brought back to his r\xc3\xb4le. He had not been invited to\r\ndine in such good company simply to moon dreamily and say nothing.\r\n\r\nA retired manufacturer of cotton prints, a corresponding member of the\r\nAcademy of Besan\xc3\xa7on and of that of Uz\xc3\xa8s, spoke to him from the other\r\nend of the table and asked him if what was said everywhere about his\r\nastonishing progress in the study of the New Testament was really true.\r\n\r\nA profound silence was suddenly inaugurated. A New Testament in Latin\r\nwas found as though by magic in the possession of the learned member\r\nof the two Academies. After Julien had answered, part of a sentence\r\nin Latin was read at random. Julien then recited. His memory proved\r\nfaithful and the prodigy was admired with all the boisterous energy of\r\nthe end of dinner. Julien looked at the flushed faces of the ladies. A\r\ngood many were not so plain. He recognised the wife of the collector,\r\nwho was a fine singer.\r\n\r\n"I am ashamed, as a matter of fact, to talk Latin so long before these\r\nladies," he said, turning his eyes on her. "If M. Rubigneau," that was\r\nthe name of the member of the two Academies, "will be kind enough to\r\nread a Latin sentence at random instead of answering by following the\r\nLatin text, I will try to translate it impromptu." This second test\r\ncompleted his glory.\r\n\r\nSeveral Liberals were there, who, though rich, were none the less the\r\nhappy fathers of children capable of obtaining scholarships, and had\r\nconsequently been suddenly converted at the last mission. In spite of\r\nthis diplomatic step, M. de R\xc3\xaanal had never been willing to receive\r\nthem in his house. These worthy people, who only knew Julien by name\r\nand from having seen him on horseback on the day of the king of ----\'s\r\nentry, were his most noisy admirers. "When will those fools get tired\r\nof listening to this Biblical language, which they don\'t understand in\r\nthe least," he thought. But, on the contrary, that language amused them\r\nby its strangeness and made them smile. But Julien got tired.\r\n\r\nAs six o\'clock struck he got up gravely and talked about a chapter in\r\nLigorio\'s New Theology which he had to learn by heart to recite on the\r\nfollowing day to M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan, "for," he added pleasantly, "my business is\r\nto get lessons said by heart to me, and to say them by heart myself."\r\n\r\nThere was much laughter and admiration; such is the kind of wit which\r\nis customary in Verri\xc3\xa8res. Julien had already got up and in spite of\r\netiquette everybody got up as well, so great is the dominion exercised\r\nby genius. Madame Valenod kept him for another quarter of an hour. He\r\nreally must hear her children recite their catechisms. They made the\r\nmost absurd mistakes which he alone noticed. He was careful not to\r\npoint them out. "What ignorance of the first principles of religion,"\r\nhe thought. Finally he bowed and thought he could get away; but they\r\ninsisted on his trying a fable of La Fontaine.\r\n\r\n"That author is quite immoral," said Julien to Madame Valenod. A\r\ncertain fable on Messire Jean Chouart dares to pour ridicule on\r\nall that we hold most venerable. He is shrewdly blamed by the best\r\ncommentators. Before Julien left he received four or five invitations\r\nto dinner. "This young man is an honour to the department," cried all\r\nthe guests in chorus. They even went so far as to talk of a pension\r\nvoted out of the municipal funds to put him in the position of\r\ncontinuing his studies at Paris.\r\n\r\nWhile this rash idea was resounding through the dining-room Julien\r\nhad swiftly reached the front door. "You scum, you scum," he cried,\r\nthree or four times in succession in a low voice as he indulged in the\r\npleasure of breathing in the fresh air.\r\n\r\nHe felt quite an aristocrat at this moment, though he was the very\r\nman who had been shocked for so long a period by the haughty smile of\r\ndisdainful superiority which he detected behind all the courtesies\r\naddressed to him at M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s. He could not help realising the\r\nextreme difference. Why let us even forget the fact of its being money\r\nstolen from the poor inmates, he said to himself as he went away, let\r\nus forget also their stopping the singing. M. de R\xc3\xaanal would never\r\nthink of telling his guests the price of each bottle of wine with\r\nwhich he regales them, and as for this M. Valenod, and his chronic\r\ncataloguing of his various belongings, he cannot talk of his house, his\r\nestate, etc., in the presence of his wife without saying, "Your house,\r\nyour estate."\r\n\r\nThis lady, who was apparently so keenly alive to the delights of\r\ndecorum, had just had an awful scene during the dinner with a servant\r\nwho had broken a wine-glass and spoilt one of her dozens; and the\r\nservant too had answered her back with the utmost insolence.\r\n\r\n"What a collection," said Julien to himself; "I would not live like\r\nthey do were they to give me half of all they steal. I shall give\r\nmyself away one fine day. I should not be able to restrain myself from\r\nexpressing the disgust with which they inspire one."\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, however, to obey Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s injunction and be\r\npresent at several dinners of the same kind. Julien was the fashion; he\r\nwas forgiven his Guard of Honour uniform, or rather that indiscretion\r\nwas the real cause of his successes. Soon the only question in\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res was whether M. de R\xc3\xaanal or M. the director of the workhouse\r\nwould be the victor in the struggle for the clever young man. These\r\ngentlemen formed, together with M. Maslon, a triumvirate which had\r\ntyrannised over the town for a number of years. People were jealous of\r\nthe mayor, and the Liberals had good cause for complaint, but, after\r\nall, he was noble and born for a superior position, while M. Valenod\'s\r\nfather had not left him six hundred francs a year. His career had\r\nnecessitated a transition from pitying the shabby green suit which had\r\nbeen so notorious in his youth, to envying the Norman horses, his gold\r\nchains, his Paris clothes, his whole present prosperity.\r\n\r\nJulien thought that he had discovered one honest man in the whirlpool\r\nof this novel world. He was a geometrist named Gros, and had the\r\nreputation of being a Jacobin. Julien, who had vowed to say nothing\r\nbut that which he disbelieved himself, was obliged to watch himself\r\ncarefully when speaking to M. Gros. He received big packets of\r\nexercises from Vergy. He was advised to visit his father frequently,\r\nand he fulfilled his unpleasant duty. In a word he was patching his\r\nreputation together pretty well, when he was thoroughly surprised to\r\nfind himself woken up one morning by two hands held over his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was Madame de R\xc3\xaanal who had made a trip to the town, and who,\r\nrunning up the stairs four at a time while she left her children\r\nplaying with a pet rabbit, had reached Julien\'s room a moment before\r\nher sons. This moment was delicious but very short: Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nhad disappeared when the children arrived with the rabbit which\r\nthey wanted to show to their friend. Julien gave them all a hearty\r\nwelcome, including the rabbit. He seemed at home again. He felt that\r\nhe loved these children and that he enjoyed gossiping with them. He\r\nwas astonished at the sweetness of their voices, at the simplicity\r\nand dignity of their little ways; he felt he needed to purge his\r\nimagination of all the vulgar practices and all the unpleasantnesses\r\namong which he had been living in Verri\xc3\xa8res. For there everyone was\r\nalways frightened of being scored off, and luxury and poverty were at\r\ndaggers drawn.\r\n\r\nThe people with whom he would dine would enter into confidences over\r\nthe joint which were as humiliating for themselves as they were\r\nnauseating to the hearer.\r\n\r\n"You others, who are nobles, you are right to be proud," he said to\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal, as he gave her an account of all the dinners which he\r\nhad put up with.\r\n\r\n"You\'re the fashion then," and she laughed heartily as she thought of\r\nthe rouge which Madame Valenod thought herself obliged to put on each\r\ntime she expected Julien. "I think she has designs on your heart," she\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was delicious. The presence of the children, though\r\napparently embarrassing, increased as a matter of fact the happiness of\r\nthe party. The poor children did not know how to give expression to the\r\njoy at seeing Julien again. The servants had not failed to tell them\r\nthat he had been offered two hundred francs a year more to educate the\r\nlittle Valenods.\r\n\r\nStanislas-Xavier, who was still pale from his illness, suddenly asked\r\nhis mother in the middle of the breakfast, the value of his silver\r\ncover and of the goblet in which he was drinking.\r\n\r\n"Why do you want to know that?"\r\n\r\n"I want to sell them to give the price to M. Julien so that he shan\'t\r\nbe _done_ if he stays with us."\r\n\r\nJulien kissed him with tears in his eyes. His mother wept\r\nunrestrainedly, for Julien took Stanislas on his knees and explained to\r\nhim that he should not use the word "done" which, when employed in that\r\nmeaning was an expression only fit for the servants\' hall. Seeing the\r\npleasure which he was giving to Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, he tried to explain\r\nthe meaning of being "done" by picturesque illustrations which amused\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\n"I understand," said Stanislas, "it\'s like the crow who is silly enough\r\nto let his cheese fall and be taken by the fox who has been playing the\r\nflatterer."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal felt mad with joy and covered her children with kisses,\r\na process which involved her leaning a little on Julien.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened. It was M. de R\xc3\xaanal. His severe and\r\ndiscontented expression contrasted strangely with the sweet joy\r\nwhich his presence dissipated. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal grew pale, she felt\r\nherself incapable of denying anything. Julien seized command of the\r\nconversation and commenced telling M. the mayor in a loud voice the\r\nincident of the silver goblet which Stanislas wanted to sell. He was\r\nquite certain this story would not be appreciated. M. de R\xc3\xaanal first\r\nof all frowned mechanically at the mere mention of money. Any allusion\r\nto that mineral, he was accustomed to say, is always a prelude to some\r\ndemand made upon my purse. But this was something more than a mere\r\nmoney matter. His suspicions were increased. The air of happiness which\r\nanimated his family during his absence was not calculated to smooth\r\nmatters over with a man who was a prey to so touchy a vanity. "Yes,\r\nyes," he said, as his wife started to praise to him the combined grace\r\nand cleverness of the way in which Julien gave ideas to his pupils. "I\r\nknow, he renders me hateful to my own children. It is easy enough for\r\nhim to make himself a hundred times more loveable to them than I am\r\nmyself, though after all, I am the master. In this century everything\r\ntends to make _legitimate_ authority unpopular. Poor France!"\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal had not stopped to examine the fine shades of the\r\nwelcome which her husband gave her. She had just caught a glimpse of\r\nthe possibility of spending twelve hours with Julien. She had a lot of\r\npurchases to make in the town and declared that she positively insisted\r\nin going to dine at the tavern. She stuck to her idea in spite of all\r\nher husband\'s protests and remonstrances. The children were delighted\r\nwith the mere word tavern, which our modern prudery denounces with so\r\nmuch gusto.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal left his wife in the first draper\'s shop which she entered\r\nand went to pay some visits. He came back more morose than he had\r\nbeen in the morning. He was convinced that the whole town was busy\r\nwith himself and Julien. As a matter of fact no one had yet given him\r\nany inkling as to the more offensive part of the public gossip. Those\r\nitems which had been repeated to M. the mayor dealt exclusively with\r\nthe question of whether Julien would remain with him with six hundred\r\nfrancs, or would accept the eight hundred francs offered by M. the\r\ndirector of the workhouse.\r\n\r\nThe director, when he met M. de R\xc3\xaanal in society, gave him the cold\r\nshoulder. These tactics were not without cleverness. There is no\r\nimpulsiveness in the provinces. Sensations are so rare there that they\r\nare never allowed to be wasted.\r\n\r\nM. le Valenod was what is called a hundred miles from Paris a _faraud_;\r\nthat means a coarse imprudent type of man. His triumphant existence\r\nsince 1815 had consolidated his natural qualities. He reigned, so\r\nto say, in Verri\xc3\xa8res subject to the orders of M. de R\xc3\xaanal; but as\r\nhe was much more energetic, was ashamed of nothing, had a finger in\r\neverything, and was always going about writing and speaking, and\r\nwas oblivious of all snubs, he had, although without any personal\r\npretensions, eventually come to equal the mayor in reputation in the\r\neyes of the ecclesiastical authorities. M. Valenod had, as it were,\r\nsaid to the local tradesmen "Give me the two biggest fools among your\r\nnumber;" to the men of law "Show me the two greatest dunces;" to the\r\nsanitary officials "Point out to me the two biggest charlatans." When\r\nhe had thus collected the most impudent members of each separate\r\ncalling, he had practically said to them, "Let us reign together."\r\n\r\nThe manners of those people were offensive to M. de R\xc3\xaanal. The\r\ncoarseness of Valenod took offence at nothing, not even the frequency\r\nwith which the little abb\xc3\xa9 Maslon would give the lie to him in public.\r\n\r\nBut in the middle of all this prosperity M. Valenod found it necessary\r\nto reassure himself by a number of petty acts of insolence on the\r\nscore of the crude truths which he well realised that everybody was\r\njustified in addressing to him. His activity had redoubled since the\r\nfears which the visit of M. Appert had left him. He had made three\r\njourneys to Besan\xc3\xa7on. He wrote several letters by each courier; he sent\r\nothers by unknown men who came to his house at nightfall. Perhaps he\r\nhad been wrong in securing the dismissal of the old cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan. For\r\nthis piece of vindictiveness had resulted in his being considered an\r\nextremely malicious man by several pious women of good birth. Besides,\r\nthe rendering of this service had placed him in absolute dependence\r\non M. the Grand Vicar de Frilair from whom he received some strange\r\ncommissions. He had reached this point in his intrigues when he had\r\nyielded to the pleasure of writing an anonymous letter, and thus\r\nincreasing his embarrassment. His wife declared to him that she wanted\r\nto have Julien in her house; her vanity was intoxicated with the idea.\r\n\r\nSuch being his position M. Valenod imagined in advance a decisive\r\nscene with his old colleague M. de R\xc3\xaanal. The latter might address\r\nto him some harsh words, which he would not mind much; but he might\r\nwrite to Besan\xc3\xa7on and even to Paris. Some minister\'s cousin might\r\nsuddenly fall down on Verri\xc3\xa8res and take over the workhouse. Valenod\r\nthought of coming to terms with the Liberals. It was for that purpose\r\nthat several of them had been invited to the dinner when Julien was\r\npresent. He would have obtained powerful support against the mayor but\r\nthe elections might supervene, and it was only too evident that the\r\ndirectorship of the workhouse was inconsistent with voting on the wrong\r\nside. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had made a shrewd guess at this intrigue, and\r\nwhile she explained it to Julien as he gave her his arm to pass from\r\none shop to another, they found themselves gradually taken as far as\r\nthe _Cours de la Fid\xc3\xa9lit\xc3\xa9_ where they spent several hours nearly as\r\ntranquil as those at Vergy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time M. Valenod was trying to put off a definite crisis\r\nwith his old patron by himself assuming the aggressive. These tactics\r\nsucceeded on this particular day, but aggravated the mayor\'s bad\r\ntemper. Never has vanity at close grips with all the harshness and\r\nmeanness of a pettifogging love of money reduced a man to a more sorry\r\ncondition than that of M. de R\xc3\xaanal when he entered the tavern. The\r\nchildren, on the other hand, had never been more joyful and more merry.\r\nThis contrast put the finishing touch on his pique.\r\n\r\n"So far as I can see I am not wanted in my family," he said as he\r\nentered in a tone which he meant to be impressive.\r\n\r\nFor answer, his wife took him on one side and declared that it was\r\nessential to send Julien away. The hours of happiness which she had\r\njust enjoyed had given her again the ease and firmness of demeanour\r\nnecessary to follow out the plan of campaign which she had been\r\nhatching for a fortnight. The finishing touch to the trouble of the\r\npoor mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res was the fact that he knew that they joked\r\npublicly in the town about his love for cash. Valenod was as generous\r\nas a thief, and on his side had acquitted himself brilliantly in the\r\nlast five or six collections for the Brotherhood of St. Joseph, the\r\ncongregation of the Virgin, the congregation of the Holy Sacrament,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s name had been seen more than once at the bottom of the\r\nlist of gentlefolk of Verri\xc3\xa8res, and the surrounding neighbourhood\r\nwho were adroitly classified in the list of the collecting brethren\r\naccording to the amount of their offerings. It was in vain that he said\r\nthat he was _not making money_. The clergy stands no nonsense in such\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSORROWS OF AN OFFICIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n        Il piacere di alzar la testa tutto l\'anno, \xc3\xa8 ben pagato\r\n        da certi quarti d\'ora che bisogna passar.--_Casti_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us leave this petty man to his petty fears; why did he take a man\r\nof spirit into his household when he needed someone with the soul\r\nof a valet? Why can\'t he select his staff? The ordinary trend of\r\nthe nineteenth century is that when a noble and powerful individual\r\nencounters a man of spirit, he kills him, exiles him and imprisons him,\r\nor so humiliates him that the other is foolish enough to die of grief.\r\nIn this country it so happens that it is not merely the man of spirit\r\nwho suffers. The great misfortunes of the little towns of France and of\r\nrepresentative governments, like that of New York, is that they find\r\nit impossible to forget the existence of individuals like M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\nIt is these men who make public opinion in a town of twenty thousand\r\ninhabitants, and public opinion is terrible in a country which has a\r\ncharter of liberty. A man, though of a naturally noble and generous\r\ndisposition, who would have been your friend in the natural course of\r\nevents, but who happens to live a hundred leagues off, judges you by\r\nthe public opinion of your town which is made by those fools who have\r\nchanced to be born noble, rich and conservative. Unhappy is the man who\r\ndistinguishes himself.\r\n\r\nImmediately after dinner they left for Vergy, but the next day but\r\none Julien saw the whole family return to Verri\xc3\xa8res. An hour had not\r\npassed before he discovered to his great surprise that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nhad some mystery up her sleeve. Whenever he came into the room she\r\nwould break off her conversation with her husband and would almost\r\nseem to desire that he should go away. Julien did not need to be given\r\nthis hint twice. He became cold and reserved. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal noticed\r\nit and did not ask for an explanation. "Is she going to give me a\r\nsuccessor," thought Julien. "And to think of her being so familiar\r\nwith me the day before yesterday, but that is how these great ladies\r\nare said to act. It\'s just like kings. One never gets any more warning\r\nthan the disgraced minister who enters his house to find his letter of\r\ndismissal." Julien noticed that these conversations which left off so\r\nabruptly at his approach, often dealt with a big house which belonged\r\nto the municipality of Verri\xc3\xa8res, a house which though old was large\r\nand commodious and situated opposite the church in the most busy\r\ncommercial district of the town. "What connection can there be between\r\nthis house and a new lover," said Julien to himself. In his chagrin he\r\nrepeated to himself the pretty verses of Francis I. which seemed novel\r\nto him, for Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had only taught him them a month before:\r\n\r\n    Souvent femme varie\r\n    Bien fol est qui s\'y fie.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal took the mail to Besan\xc3\xa7on. This journey was a matter of two\r\nhours. He seemed extremely harassed. On his return he threw a big grey\r\npaper parcel on the table.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s that silly business," he said to his wife. An hour afterwards\r\nJulien saw the bill-poster carrying the big parcel. He followed him\r\neagerly. "I shall learn the secret at the first street corner." He\r\nwaited impatiently behind the bill-poster who was smearing the back of\r\nthe poster with his big brush. It had scarcely been put in its place\r\nbefore Julien\'s curiosity saw the detailed announcement of the putting\r\nup for public auction of that big old house whose name had figured so\r\nfrequently in M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s conversations with his wife. The auction of\r\nthe lease was announced for to-morrow at two o\'clock in the Town Hall\r\nafter the extinction of the third fire. Julien was very disappointed.\r\nHe found the time a little short. How could there be time to apprise\r\nall the other would-be purchasers. But, moreover, the bill, which was\r\ndated a fortnight back, and which he read again in its entirety in\r\nthree distinct places, taught him nothing.\r\n\r\nHe went to visit the house which was to let. The porter, who had not\r\nseen him approach, was saying mysteriously to a neighbour:\r\n\r\n"Pooh, pooh, waste of time. M. Maslon has promised him that he shall\r\nhave it for three hundred francs; and, as the mayor kicked, he has been\r\nsummoned to the bishop\'s palace by M. the Grand Vicar de Frilair."\r\n\r\nJulien\'s arrival seemed very much to disconcert the two friends who\r\ndid not say another word. Julien made a point of being present at the\r\nauction of the lease.\r\n\r\nThere was a crowd in the badly-lighted hall, but everybody kept\r\nquizzing each other in quite a singular way. All eyes were fixed on a\r\ntable where Julien perceived three little lighted candle-ends on a tin\r\nplate. The usher was crying out "Three hundred francs, gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"Three hundred francs, that\'s a bit too thick," said a man to his\r\nneighbour in a low voice. Julien was between the two of them. "It\'s\r\nworth more than eight hundred, I will raise the bidding." "It\'s cutting\r\noff your nose to spite your face. What will you gain by putting M.\r\nMaslon, M. Valenod, the Bishop, this terrible Grand Vicar de Frilair\r\nand the whole gang on your track."\r\n\r\n"Three hundred and twenty francs," shouted out the other.\r\n\r\n"Damned brute," answered his neighbour. "Why here we have a spy of the\r\nmayor," he added, designating Julien.\r\n\r\nJulien turned sharply round to punish this remark, but the two,\r\nFranc-comtois, were no longer paying any attention to him. Their\r\ncoolness gave him back his own. At that moment the last candle-end\r\nwent out and the usher\'s drawling voice awarded the house to M. de St.\r\nGiraud of the office of the prefecture of ---- for a term of nine years\r\nand for a rent of 320 francs.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the mayor had left the hall, the gossip began again.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s thirty francs that Grogeot\'s recklessness is landing the\r\nmunicipality in for," said one--"But," answered another, "M. de Saint\r\nGiraud will revenge himself on Grogeot."\r\n\r\n"How monstrous," said a big man on Julien\'s left. "A house which I\r\nmyself would have given eight hundred francs for my factory, and I\r\nwould have got a good bargain."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" answered a young manufacturer, "doesn\'t M. de St. Giraud belong\r\nto the congregation? Haven\'t his four children got scholarships? poor\r\nman! The community of Verri\xc3\xa8res must give him five hundred francs over\r\nand above his salary, that is all."\r\n\r\n"And to say that the mayor was not able to stop it," remarked a third.\r\n"For he\'s an ultra he is, I\'m glad to say, but he doesn\'t steal."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t he?" answered another. "Suppose it\'s simply a mere game of\r\n\'snap\'[1] then. Everything goes into a big common purse, and everything\r\nis divided up at the end of the year. But here\'s that little Sorel,\r\nlet\'s go away."\r\n\r\nJulien got home in a very bad temper. He found Madame de R\xc3\xaanal very sad.\r\n\r\n"You come from the auction?" she said to him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, madam, where I had the honour of passing for a spy of M. the\r\nMayor."\r\n\r\n"If he had taken my advice, he would have gone on a journey."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Monsieur de R\xc3\xaanal appeared: he looked very dismal. The\r\ndinner passed without a single word. Monsieur de R\xc3\xaanal ordered Julien\r\nto follow the children to Vergy.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal endeavoured to console her husband.\r\n\r\n"You ought to be used to it, my dear."\r\n\r\nThat evening they were seated in silence around the domestic hearth.\r\nThe crackle of the burnt pinewood was their only distraction. It\r\nwas one of those moments of silence which happen in the most united\r\nfamilies. One of the children cried out gaily,\r\n\r\n"Somebody\'s ringing, somebody\'s ringing!"\r\n\r\n"Zounds! supposing it\'s Monsieur de Saint Giraud who has come under\r\nthe pretext of thanking me," exclaimed the mayor. "I will give him a\r\ndressing down. It is outrageous. It is Valenod to whom he\'ll feel under\r\nan obligation, and it is I who get compromised. What shall I say if\r\nthose damned Jacobin journalists get hold of this anecdote, and turn me\r\ninto a M. Nonante Cinque."\r\n\r\nA very good-looking man, with big black whiskers, entered at this\r\nmoment, preceded by the servant.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur the mayor, I am Signor Geronimo. Here is a letter which M.\r\nthe Chevalier de Beauvoisis, who is attached to the Embassy of Naples,\r\ngave me for you on my departure. That is only nine days ago, added\r\nSignor Geronimo, gaily looking at Madame de R\xc3\xaanal. Your cousin, and my\r\ngood friend, Signor de Beauvoisis says that you know Italian, Madame."\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan\'s good humour changed this gloomy evening into a very\r\ngay one. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal insisted upon giving him supper. She put the\r\nwhole house on the go. She wanted to free Julien at any price from the\r\nimputation of espionage which she had heard already twice that day.\r\n\r\nSignor Geronimo was an excellent singer, excellent company, and had\r\nvery gay qualities which, at any rate in France, are hardly compatible\r\nwith each other. After dinner he sang a little duet with Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal, and told some charming tales. At one o\'clock in the morning the\r\nchildren protested, when Julien suggested that they should go to bed.\r\n\r\n"Another of those stories," said the eldest.\r\n\r\n"It is my own, Signorino," answered Signor Geronimo.\r\n\r\n"Eight years ago I was, like you, a young pupil of the Naples\r\nConservatoire. I mean I was your age, but I did not have the honour to\r\nbe the son of the distinguished mayor of the pretty town of Verri\xc3\xa8res."\r\nThis phrase made M. de R\xc3\xaanal sigh, and look at his wife.\r\n\r\n"Signor Zingarelli," continued the young singer, somewhat exaggerating\r\nhis action, and thus making the children burst into laughter, "Signor\r\nZingarelli was an excellent though severe master. He is not popular at\r\nthe Conservatoire, but he insists on the pretence being kept up that he\r\nis. I went out as often as I could. I used to go to the little Theatre\r\nde San Carlino, where I used to hear divine music. But heavens! the\r\nquestion was to scrape together the eight sous which were the price of\r\nadmission to the parterre? An enormous sum," he said, looking at the\r\nchildren and watching them laugh. "Signor Giovannone, director of the\r\nSan Carlino, heard me sing. I was sixteen. \'That child is a treasure,\'\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n"\'Would you like me to engage you, my dear boy?\' he said.\r\n\r\n"\'And how much will you give me?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Forty ducats a month.\' That is one hundred and sixty francs,\r\ngentlemen. I thought the gates of heaven had opened.\r\n\r\n"\'But,\' I said to Giovannone, \'how shall I get the strict Zingarelli to\r\nlet me go out?\'\r\n\r\n"\'_Lascia fare a me_.\'"\r\n\r\n"Leave it to me," exclaimed the eldest of the children.\r\n\r\n"Quite right, my young sir. Signor Giovannone he says to me, \'First\r\nsign this little piece of paper, my dear friend.\' I sign.\r\n\r\n"He gives me three ducats. I had never seen so much money. Then he told\r\nme what I had to do.\r\n\r\n"Next day I asked the terrible Zingarelli for an audience. His old\r\nvalet ushered me in.\r\n\r\n"\'What do you want of me, you naughty boy?\' said Zingarelli.\r\n\r\n"\'Maestro,\' I said, \'I repent of all my faults. I will never go out of\r\nthe Conservatoire by passing through the iron grill. I will redouble my\r\ndiligence.\'\r\n\r\n"\'If I were not frightened of spoiling the finest bass voice I have\r\never heard, I would put you in prison for a fortnight on bread and\r\nwater, you rascal.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Maestro,\' I answered, \'I will be the model boy of the whole school,\r\n_credete a me_, but I would ask one favour of you. If anyone comes and\r\nasks permission for me to sing outside, refuse. As a favour, please say\r\nthat you cannot let me.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And who the devil do you think is going to ask for a ne\'er-do-well\r\nlike you? Do you think I should ever allow you to leave the\r\nConservatoire? Do you want to make fun of me? Clear out! Clear out!\' he\r\nsaid, trying to give me a kick, \'or look out for prison and dry bread.\'"\r\n\r\nOne thing astonished Julien. The solitary weeks passed at Verri\xc3\xa8res in\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal\'s house had been a period of happiness for him. He had only\r\nexperienced revulsions and sad thoughts at the dinners to which he had\r\nbeen invited. And was he not able to read, write and reflect, without\r\nbeing distracted, in this solitary house? He was not distracted every\r\nmoment from his brilliant reveries by the cruel necessity of studying\r\nthe movement of a false soul in order to deceive it by intrigue and\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\n"To think of happiness being so near to me--the expense of a life\r\nlike that is small enough. I could have my choice of either marrying\r\nMademoiselle Elisa or of entering into partnership with Fouqu\xc3\xa9. But it\r\nis only the traveller who has just scaled a steep mountain and sits\r\ndown on the summit who finds a perfect pleasure in resting. Would he be\r\nhappy if he had to rest all the time?"\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s mind had now reached a state of desperation. In spite\r\nof her resolutions, she had explained to Julien all the details of the\r\nauction. "He will make me forget all my oaths!" she thought.\r\n\r\nShe would have sacrificed her life without hesitation to save that\r\nof her husband if she had seen him in danger. She was one of those\r\nnoble, romantic souls who find a source of perpetual remorse equal to\r\nthat occasioned by the actual perpetration of a crime, in seeing the\r\npossibility of a generous action and not doing it. None the less, there\r\nwere deadly days when she was not able to banish the imagination of\r\nthe excessive happiness which she would enjoy if she suddenly became a\r\nwidow, and were able to marry Julien.\r\n\r\nHe loved her sons much more than their father did; in spite of his\r\nstrict justice they were devoted to him. She quite realised that if\r\nshe married Julien, it would be necessary to leave that Vergy, whose\r\nshades were so dear to her. She pictured herself living at Paris, and\r\ncontinuing to give her sons an education which would make them admired\r\nby everyone. Her children, herself, and Julien! They would be all\r\nperfectly happy!\r\n\r\nStrange result of marriage such as the nineteenth century has made it!\r\nThe boredom of matrimonial life makes love fade away inevitably, when\r\nlove has preceded the marriage. But none the less, said a philosopher,\r\nmarried life soon reduces those people who are sufficiently rich\r\nnot to have to work, to a sense of being utterly bored by all quiet\r\nenjoyments. And among women, it is only arid souls whom it does not\r\npredispose to love.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher\'s reflection makes me excuse Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, but she\r\nwas not excused in Verri\xc3\xa8res, and without her suspecting it, the whole\r\ntown found its sole topic of interest in the scandal of her intrigue.\r\nAs a result of this great affair, the autumn was less boring than usual.\r\n\r\nThe autumn and part of the winter passed very quickly. It was necessary\r\nto leave the woods of Vergy. Good Verri\xc3\xa8res society began to be\r\nindignant at the fact that its anathemas made so little impression on\r\nMonsieur de R\xc3\xaanal. Within eight days, several serious personages who\r\nmade up for their habitual gravity of demeanour by their pleasure in\r\nfulfilling missions of this kind, gave him the most cruel suspicions,\r\nat the same time utilising the most measured terms.\r\n\r\nM. Valenod, who was playing a deep game, had placed Elisa in an\r\naristocratic family of great repute, where there were five women.\r\nElisa, fearing, so she said, not to find a place during the winter, had\r\nonly asked from this family about two-thirds of what she had received\r\nin the house of the mayor. The girl hit upon the excellent idea of\r\ngoing to confession at the same time to both the old cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan,\r\nand also to the new one, so as to tell both of them in detail about\r\nJulien\'s amours.\r\n\r\nThe day after his arrival, the abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan summoned Julien to him at\r\nsix o\'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n"I ask you nothing," he said. "I beg you, and if needs be I insist,\r\nthat you either leave for the Seminary of Besan\xc3\xa7on, or for your friend\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9, who is always ready to provide you with a splendid future. I\r\nhave seen to everything and have arranged everything, but you must\r\nleave, and not come back to Verri\xc3\xa8res for a year."\r\n\r\nJulien did not answer. He was considering whether his honour ought to\r\nregard itself offended at the trouble which Ch\xc3\xa9lan, who, after all, was\r\nnot his father, had taken on his behalf.\r\n\r\n"I shall have the honour of seeing you again to-morrow at the same\r\nhour," he said finally to the cur\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nCh\xc3\xa9lan, who reckoned on carrying so young a man by storm, talked a\r\ngreat deal. Julien, cloaked in the most complete humbleness, both of\r\ndemeanour and expression, did not open his lips.\r\n\r\nEventually he left, and ran to warn Madame de R\xc3\xaanal whom he found in\r\ndespair. Her husband had just spoken to her with a certain amount of\r\nfrankness. The weakness of his character found support in the prospect\r\nof the legacy, and had decided him to treat her as perfectly innocent.\r\nHe had just confessed to her the strange state in which he had found\r\npublic opinion in Verri\xc3\xa8res. The public was wrong; it had been misled\r\nby jealous tongues. But, after all, what was one to do?\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was, for the moment, under the illusion that Julien\r\nwould accept the offer of Valenod and stay at Verri\xc3\xa8res. But she was no\r\nlonger the simple, timid woman that she had been the preceding year.\r\nHer fatal passion and remorse had enlightened her. She soon realised\r\nthe painful truth (while at the same time she listened to her husband),\r\nthat at any rate a temporary separation had become essential.\r\n\r\nWhen he is far from me, Julien will revert to those ambitious projects\r\nwhich are so natural when one has no money. And I, Great God! I am so\r\nrich, and my riches are so useless for my happiness. He will forget\r\nme. Loveable as he is, he will be loved, and he will love. You unhappy\r\nwoman. What can I complain of? Heaven is just. I was not virtuous\r\nenough to leave off the crime. Fate robs me of my judgment. I could\r\neasily have bribed Elisa if I had wanted to; nothing was easier. I did\r\nnot take the trouble to reflect for a moment. The mad imagination of\r\nlove absorbed all my time. I am ruined.\r\n\r\nWhen Julien apprised Madame de R\xc3\xaanal of the terrible news of his\r\ndeparture, he was struck with one thing. He did not find her put\r\nforward any selfish objections. She was evidently making efforts not to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n"We have need of firmness, my dear." She cut off a strand of her hair.\r\n"I do no know what I shall do," she said to him, "but promise me if I\r\ndie, never to forget my children. Whether you are far or near, try to\r\nmake them into honest men. If there is a new revolution, all the nobles\r\nwill have their throats cut. Their father will probably emigrate,\r\nbecause of that peasant on the roof who got killed. Watch over my\r\nfamily. Give me your hand. Adieu, my dear. These are our last moments.\r\nHaving made this great sacrifice, I hope I shall have the courage to\r\nconsider my reputation in public."\r\n\r\nJulien had been expecting despair. The simplicity of this farewell\r\ntouched him.\r\n\r\n"No, I am not going to receive your farewell like this. I will leave\r\nyou now, as you yourself wish it. But three days after my departure I\r\nwill come back to see you at night."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s life was changed. So Julien really loved her, since\r\nof his own accord he had thought of seeing her again. Her awful grief\r\nbecame changed into one of the keenest transports of joy which she had\r\nfelt in her whole life. Everything became easy for her. The certainty\r\nof seeing her lover deprived these last moments of their poignancy.\r\nFrom that moment, both Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s demeanour and the expression\r\nof her face were noble, firm, and perfectly dignified.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal soon came back. He was beside himself. He eventually\r\nmentioned to his wife the anonymous letter which he had received two\r\nmonths before.\r\n\r\n"I will take it to the Casino, and shew everybody that it has been sent\r\nby that brute Valenod, whom I took out of the gutter and made into one\r\nof the richest tradesmen in Verri\xc3\xa8res. I will disgrace him publicly,\r\nand then I will fight him. This is too much."\r\n\r\n"Great Heavens! I may become a widow," thought Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, and\r\nalmost at the same time she said to herself,\r\n\r\n"If I do not, as I certainly can, prevent this duel, I shall be the\r\nmurderess of my own husband."\r\n\r\nShe had never expended so much skill in honoring his vanity. Within\r\ntwo hours she made him see, and always by virtue of reasons which he\r\ndiscovered himself, that it was necessary to show more friendship than\r\never to M. Valenod, and even to take Elisa back into the household.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal had need of courage to bring herself to see again the\r\ngirl who was the cause of her unhappiness. But this idea was one of\r\nJulien\'s. Finally, having been put on the track three or four times,\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal arrived spontaneously at the conclusion, disagreeable\r\nthough it was from the financial standpoint, that the most painful\r\nthing that could happen to him would be that Julien, in the middle of\r\nthe effervescence of popular gossip throughout Verri\xc3\xa8res, should stay\r\nin the town as the tutor of Valenod\'s children. It was obviously to\r\nJulien\'s interest to accept the offer of the director of the workhouse.\r\nConversely, it was essential for M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s prestige that Julien\r\nshould leave Verri\xc3\xa8res to enter the seminary of Besan\xc3\xa7on or that of\r\nDijon. But how to make him decide on that course? And then how is he\r\ngoing to live?\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal, seeing a monetary sacrifice looming in the distance,\r\nwas in deeper despair than his wife. As for her, she felt after this\r\ninterview in the position of a man of spirit who, tired of life, has\r\ntaken a dose of stramonium. He only acts mechanically so to speak, and\r\ntakes no longer any interest in anything. In this way, Louis XIV. came\r\nto say on his death-bed, "When I was king." An admirable epigram.\r\n\r\nNext morning, M. de R\xc3\xaanal received quite early an anonymous letter.\r\nIt was written in a most insulting style, and the coarsest words\r\napplicable to his position occurred on every line. It was the work of\r\nsome jealous subordinate. This letter made him think again of fighting\r\na duel with Valenod. Soon his courage went as far as the idea of\r\nimmediate action. He left the house alone, went to the armourer\'s and\r\ngot some pistols which he loaded.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," he said to himself, "even though the strict\r\nadministration of the Emperor Napoleon were to become fashionable\r\nagain, I should not have one sou\'s worth of jobbery to reproach myself\r\nwith; at the outside, I have shut my eyes, and I have some good letters\r\nin my desk which authorise me to do so."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was terrified by her husband\'s cold anger. It recalled\r\nto her the fatal idea of widowhood which she had so much trouble in\r\nrepelling. She closeted herself with him. For several hours she talked\r\nto him in vain. The new anonymous letter had decided him. Finally she\r\nsucceeded in transforming the courage which had decided him to box\r\nValenod\'s ears, into the courage of offering six hundred francs to\r\nJulien, which would keep him for one year in a seminary.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal cursed a thousand times the day that he had had the\r\nill-starred idea of taking a tutor into his house, and forgot the\r\nanonymous letter.\r\n\r\nHe consoled himself a little by an idea which he did not tell his\r\nwife. With the exercise of some skill, and by exploiting the romantic\r\nideas of the young man, he hoped to be able to induce him to refuse M.\r\nValenod\'s offer at a cheaper price.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal had much more trouble in proving to Julien that\r\ninasmuch as he was sacrificing the post of six hundred francs a year\r\nin order to enable her husband to keep up appearances, he need have no\r\nshame about accepting the compensation. But Julien would say each time,\r\n"I have never thought for a moment of accepting that offer. You have\r\nmade me so used to a refined life that the coarseness of those people\r\nwould kill me."\r\n\r\nCruel necessity bent Julien\'s will with its iron hand. His pride gave\r\nhim the illusion that he only accepted the sum offered by M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nas a loan, and induced him to give him a promissory note, repayable in\r\nfive years with interest.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal had, of course, many thousands of francs which had been\r\nconcealed in the little mountain cave.\r\n\r\nShe offered them to him all a tremble, feeling only too keenly that\r\nthey would be angrily refused.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish," said Julien to her, "to make the memory of our love\r\nloathsome?"\r\n\r\nFinally Julien left Verri\xc3\xa8res. M. de R\xc3\xaanal was very happy, but when\r\nthe fatal moment came to accept money from him the sacrifice proved\r\nbeyond Julien\'s strength. He refused point blank. M. de R\xc3\xaanal embraced\r\nhim around the neck with tears in his eyes. Julien had asked him for\r\na testimonial of good conduct, and his enthusiasm could find no terms\r\nmagnificent enough in which to extol his conduct.\r\n\r\nOur hero had five louis of savings and he reckoned on asking Fouqu\xc3\xa9 for\r\nan equal sum.\r\n\r\nHe was very moved. But one league from Verri\xc3\xa8res, where he left so much\r\nthat was dear to him, he only thought of the happiness of seeing the\r\ncapital of a great military town like Besan\xc3\xa7on.\r\n\r\nDuring the short absence of three days, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal was the victim\r\nof one of the cruellest deceptions to which love is liable. Her life\r\nwas tolerable, because between her and extreme unhappiness there was\r\nstill that last interview which she was to have with Julien.\r\n\r\nFinally during the night of the third day, she heard from a distance\r\nthe preconcerted signal. Julien, having passed through a thousand\r\ndangers, appeared before her. In this moment she only had one\r\nthought--"I see him for the last time." Instead of answering the\r\nendearments of her lover, she seemed more dead than alive. If she\r\nforced herself to tell him that she loved him, she said it with an\r\nembarrassed air which almost proved the contrary. Nothing could rid her\r\nof the cruel idea of eternal separation. The suspicious Julien thought\r\nfor the moment that he was already forgotten. His pointed remarks to\r\nthis effect were only answered by great tears which flowed down in\r\nsilence, and by some hysterical pressings of the hand.\r\n\r\n"But," Julien would answer his mistress\'s cold protestations, "Great\r\nHeavens! How can you expect me to believe you? You would show one\r\nhundred times more sincere affection to Madame Derville to a mere\r\nacquaintance."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was petrified, and at a loss for an answer.\r\n\r\n"It is impossible to be more unhappy. I hope I am going to die. I feel\r\nmy heart turn to ice."\r\n\r\nThose were the longest answers which he could obtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the approach of day rendered it necessary for him to leave Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal, her tears completely ceased. She saw him tie a knotted rope\r\nto the window without saying a word, and without returning her kisses.\r\nIt was in vain that Julien said to her.\r\n\r\n"So now we have reached the state of affairs which you wished for\r\nso much. Henceforward you will live without remorse. The slightest\r\nindisposition of your children will no longer make you see them in the\r\ntomb."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that you cannot kiss Stanislas," she said coldly.\r\n\r\nJulien finished by being profoundly impressed by the cold embraces of\r\nthis living corpse. He could think of nothing else for several leagues.\r\nHis soul was overwhelmed, and before passing the mountain, and while\r\nhe could still see the church tower of Verri\xc3\xa8res he turned round\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] C\'est pigeon qui vole. A reference to a contemporary animal game\r\nwith a pun on the word "vole."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nA CAPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\n        What a noise, what busy people! What ideas for the\r\n        future in a brain of twenty! What distraction offered by\r\n        love.--_Barnave_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally he saw some black walls near a distant mountain. It was the\r\ncitadel of Besan\xc3\xa7on. "How different it would be for me," he said\r\nwith a sigh, "if I were arriving at this noble military town to be\r\nsub-lieutenant in one of the regiments entrusted with its defence."\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on is not only one of the prettiest towns in France, it abounds\r\nin people of spirit and brains. But Julien was only a little peasant,\r\nand had no means of approaching distinguished people.\r\n\r\nHe had taken a civilian suit at Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s, and it was in this dress that\r\nhe passed the drawbridge. Steeped as he was in the history of the siege\r\nof 1674, he wished to see the ramparts of the citadel before shutting\r\nhimself up in the seminary. He was within an ace two or three times\r\nof getting himself arrested by the sentinel. He was penetrating into\r\nplaces which military genius forbids the public to enter, in order to\r\nsell twelve or fifteen francs worth of corn every year.\r\n\r\nThe height of the walls, the depth of the ditches, the terrible aspect\r\nof the cannons had been engrossing him for several hours when he passed\r\nbefore the great caf\xc3\xa9 on the boulevard. He was motionless with wonder;\r\nit was in vain that he read the word _caf\xc3\xa9_, written in big characters\r\nabove the two immense doors. He could not believe his eyes. He made an\r\neffort to overcome his timidity. He dared to enter, and found himself\r\nin a hall twenty or thirty yards long, and with a ceiling at least\r\ntwenty feet high. To-day, everything had a fascination for him.\r\n\r\nTwo games of billiards were in progress. The waiters were crying out\r\nthe scores. The players ran round the tables encumbered by spectators.\r\nClouds of tobacco smoke came from everybody\'s mouth, and enveloped them\r\nin a blue haze. The high stature of these men, their rounded shoulders,\r\ntheir heavy gait, their enormous whiskers, the long tailed coats which\r\ncovered them, everything combined to attract Julien\'s attention. These\r\nnoble children of the antique Bisontium only spoke at the top of their\r\nvoice. They gave themselves terrible martial airs. Julien stood still\r\nand admired them. He kept thinking of the immensity and magnificence\r\nof a great capital like Besan\xc3\xa7on. He felt absolutely devoid of the\r\nrequisite courage to ask one of those haughty looking gentlemen, who\r\nwere crying out the billiard scores, for a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nBut the young lady at the bar had noticed the charming face of this\r\nyoung civilian from the country, who had stopped three feet from\r\nthe stove with his little parcel under his arm, and was looking at\r\nthe fine white plaster bust of the king. This young lady, a big\r\n_Franc-comtoise_, very well made, and dressed with the elegance\r\nsuitable to the prestige of the caf\xc3\xa9, had already said two or three\r\ntimes in a little voice not intended to be heard by any one except\r\nJulien, "Monsieur, Monsieur." Julien\'s eyes encountered big blue eyes\r\nfull of tenderness, and saw that he was the person who was being spoken\r\nto.\r\n\r\nHe sharply approached the bar and the pretty girl, as though he had\r\nbeen marching towards the enemy. In this great man\xc5\x93uvre the parcel fell.\r\n\r\nWhat pity will not our provincial inspire in the young lyc\xc3\xa9e scholars\r\nof Paris, who, at the early age of fifteen, know already how to enter\r\na caf\xc3\xa9 with so distinguished an air? But these children who have such\r\nstyle at fifteen turn commonplace at eighteen. The impassioned timidity\r\nwhich is met with in the provinces, sometimes manages to master its own\r\nnervousness, and thus trains the will. "I must tell her the truth,"\r\nthought Julien, who was becoming courageous by dint of conquering his\r\ntimidity as he approached this pretty girl, who deigned to address him.\r\n\r\n"Madame, this is the first time in my life that I have come to\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on. I should like to have some bread and a cup of coffee in\r\nreturn for payment."\r\n\r\nThe young lady smiled a little, and then blushed. She feared the ironic\r\nattention and the jests of the billiard players might be turned against\r\nthis pretty young man. He would be frightened and would not appear\r\nthere again.\r\n\r\n"Sit here near me," she said to him, showing him a marble table almost\r\ncompletely hidden by the enormous mahogany counter which extended into\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nThe young lady leant over the counter, and had thus an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying a superb figure. Julien noticed it. All his ideas changed.\r\nThe pretty young lady had just placed before him a cup, some sugar, and\r\na little roll. She hesitated to call a waiter for the coffee, as she\r\nrealised that his arrival would put an end to her _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with\r\nJulien.\r\n\r\nJulien was pensively comparing this blonde and merry beauty with\r\ncertain memories which would often thrill him. The thought of the\r\npassion of which he had been the object, nearly freed him from all\r\nhis timidity. The pretty young woman had only one moment to save the\r\nsituation. She read it in Julien\'s looks.\r\n\r\n"This pipe smoke makes you cough; come and have breakfast to-morrow\r\nbefore eight o\'clock in the morning. I am practically alone then."\r\n\r\n"What is your name?" said Julien, with the caressing smile of happy\r\ntimidity.\r\n\r\n"Amanda Binet."\r\n\r\n"Will you allow me to send you within an hour\'s time a little parcel\r\nabout as big as this?"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Amanda reflected a little.\r\n\r\n"I am watched. What you ask may compromise me. All the same, I will\r\nwrite my address on a card, which you will put on your parcel. Send it\r\nboldly to me."\r\n\r\n"My name is Julien Sorel," said the young man. "I have neither\r\nrelatives nor acquaintances at Besan\xc3\xa7on."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I understand," she said joyfully. "You come to study law."\r\n\r\n"Alas, no," answered Julien, "I am being sent to the Seminary."\r\n\r\nThe most complete discouragement damped Amanda\'s features. She called\r\na waiter. She had courage now. The waiter poured out some coffee for\r\nJulien without looking at him.\r\n\r\nAmanda was receiving money at the counter. Julien was proud of having\r\ndared to speak: a dispute was going on at one of the billiard tables.\r\nThe cries and the protests of the players resounded over the immense\r\nhall, and made a din which astonished Julien. Amanda was dreamy, and\r\nkept her eyes lowered.\r\n\r\n"If you like, Mademoiselle," he said to her suddenly with assurance, "I\r\nwill say that I am your cousin."\r\n\r\nThis little air of authority pleased Amanda. "He\'s not a mere nobody,"\r\nshe thought. She spoke to him very quickly, without looking at him,\r\nbecause her eye was occupied in seeing if anybody was coming near the\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n"I come from Genlis, near Dijon. Say that you are also from Genlis and\r\nare my mother\'s cousin."\r\n\r\n"I shall not fail to do so."\r\n\r\n"All the gentlemen who go to the Seminary pass here before the caf\xc3\xa9\r\nevery Thursday in the summer at five o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"If you think of me when I am passing, have a bunch of violets in your\r\nhand."\r\n\r\nAmanda looked at him with an astonished air. This look changed Julien\'s\r\ncourage into audacity. Nevertheless, he reddened considerably, as he\r\nsaid to her. "I feel that I love you with the most violent love."\r\n\r\n"Speak in lower tones," she said to him with a frightened air.\r\n\r\nJulien was trying to recollect phrases out of a volume of the _Nouvelle\r\nH\xc3\xa9loise_ which he had found at Vergy. His memory served him in good\r\nstead. For ten minutes he recited the _Nouvelle H\xc3\xa9loise_ to the\r\ndelighted Mademoiselle Amanda. He was happy on the strength of his own\r\nbravery, when suddenly the beautiful Franc-comtoise assumed an icy\r\nair. One of her lovers had appeared at the caf\xc3\xa9 door. He approached\r\nthe bar, whistling, and swaggering his shoulders. He looked at Julien.\r\nThe latter\'s imagination, which always indulged in extremes, suddenly\r\nbrimmed over with ideas of a duel. He paled greatly, put down his\r\ncup, assumed an assured demeanour, and considered his rival very\r\nattentively. As this rival lowered his head, while he familiarly poured\r\nout on the counter a glass of brandy for himself, Amanda ordered Julien\r\nwith a look to lower his eyes. He obeyed, and for two minutes kept\r\nmotionless in his place, pale, resolute, and only thinking of what was\r\ngoing to happen. He was truly happy at this moment. The rival had been\r\nastonished by Julien\'s eyes. Gulping down his glass of brandy, he said\r\na few words to Amanda, placed his two hands in the pockets of his big\r\ntail coat, and approached the billiard table, whistling, and looking at\r\nJulien. The latter got up transported with rage, but he did not know\r\nwhat to do in order to be offensive. He put down his little parcel, and\r\nwalked towards the billiard table with all the swagger he could muster.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that prudence said to him, "but your ecclesiastical\r\ncareer will be ruined by a duel immediately on top of your arrival at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on."\r\n\r\n"What does it matter. It shall never be said that I let an insolent\r\nfellow go scot free."\r\n\r\nAmanda saw his courage. It contrasted prettily with the simplicity of\r\nhis manners. She instantly preferred him to the big young man with the\r\ntail coat. She got up, and while appearing to be following with her eye\r\nsomebody who was passing in the street, she went and quickly placed\r\nherself between him and the billiard table.\r\n\r\n"Take care not to look askance at that gentleman. He is my\r\nbrother-in-law."\r\n\r\n"What does it matter? He looked at me."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to make me unhappy? No doubt he looked at you, why it may\r\nbe he is going to speak to you. I told him that you were a relative of\r\nmy mother, and that you had arrived from Genlis. He is a Franc-contois,\r\nand has never gone beyond D\xc3\xb4leon the Burgundy Road, so say what you\r\nlike and fear nothing."\r\n\r\nJulien was still hesitating. Her barmaid\'s imagination furnished her\r\nwith an abundance of lies, and she quickly added.\r\n\r\n"No doubt he looked at you, but it was at a moment when he was asking\r\nme who you were. He is a man who is boorish with everyone. He did not\r\nmean to insult you."\r\n\r\nJulien\'s eye followed the pretended brother-in-law. He saw him buy a\r\nticket for the pool, which they were playing at the further of the\r\ntwo billiard tables. Julien heard his loud voice shouting out in a\r\nthreatening tone, "My turn to play."\r\n\r\nHe passed sharply before Madame Amanda, and took a step towards the\r\nbilliard table. Amanda seized him by the arm.\r\n\r\n"Come and pay me first," she said to him.\r\n\r\n"That is right," thought Julien. "She is frightened that I shall leave\r\nwithout paying." Amanda was as agitated as he was, and very red. She\r\ngave him the change as slowly as she could, while she repeated to him,\r\nin a low voice,\r\n\r\n"Leave the caf\xc3\xa9 this instant, or I shall love you no more, and yet I do\r\nlove you very much."\r\n\r\nJulien did go out, but slowly. "Am I not in duty bound," he repeated\r\nto himself, "to go and stare at that coarse person in my turn?" This\r\nuncertainty kept him on the boulevard in the front of the caf\xc3\xa9 for an\r\nhour; he kept looking if his man was coming out. He did not come out,\r\nand Julien went away.\r\n\r\nHe had only been at Besan\xc3\xa7on some hours, and already he had overcome\r\none pang of remorse. The old surgeon-major had formerly given him some\r\nfencing lessons, in spite of his gout. That was all the science which\r\nJulien could enlist in the service of his anger. But this embarrassment\r\nwould have been nothing if he had only known how to vent his temper\r\notherwise than by the giving of a blow, for if it had come to a matter\r\nof fisticuffs, his enormous rival would have beaten him and then\r\ncleared out.\r\n\r\n"There is not much difference between a seminary and a prison," said\r\nJulien to himself, "for a poor devil like me, without protectors and\r\nwithout money. I must leave my civilian clothes in some inn, where I\r\ncan put my black suit on again. If I ever manage to get out of the\r\nseminary for a few hours, I shall be able to see Mdlle. Amanda again in\r\nmy lay clothes." This reasoning was all very fine. Though Julien passed\r\nin front of all the inns, he did not dare to enter a single one.\r\n\r\nFinally, as he was passing again before the H\xc3\xb4tel des Ambassadeurs, his\r\nanxious eyes encountered those of a big woman, still fairly young, with\r\na high colour, and a gay and happy air. He approached her and told his\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, my pretty little abb\xc3\xa9," said the hostess of the\r\nAmbassadeurs to him, "I will keep your lay clothes for you, and I will\r\neven have them regularly brushed. In weather like this, it is not good\r\nto leave a suit of cloth without touching it." She took a key, and\r\nconducted him herself to a room, and advised him to make out a note of\r\nwhat he was leaving.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens. How well you look like that, M. the abb\xc3\xa9 Sorel," said\r\nthe big woman to him when he came down to the kitchen. I will go and\r\nget a good dinner served up to you, and she added in a low voice, "It\r\nwill only cost twenty sous instead of the fifty which everybody else\r\npays, for one must really take care of your little purse strings."\r\n\r\n"I have ten louis," Julien replied with certain pride.\r\n\r\n"Oh, great heavens," answered the good hostess in alarm. "Don\'t talk\r\nso loud, there are quite a lot of bad characters in Besan\xc3\xa7on. They\'ll\r\nsteal all that from you in less than no time, and above all, never go\r\ninto the caf\xc3\xa9s, they are filled with bad characters."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said Julien, to whom those words gave food for thought.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go anywhere else, except to my place. I will make coffee for\r\nyou. Remember that you will always find a friend here, and a good\r\ndinner for twenty sous. So now you understand, I hope. Go and sit down\r\nat table, I will serve you myself."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t be able to eat," said Julien to her. "I am too upset. I am\r\ngoing to enter the seminary, as I leave you." The good woman, would not\r\nallow him to leave before she had filled his pockets with provisions.\r\nFinally Julien took his road towards the terrible place. The hostess\r\nwas standing at the threshold, and showed him the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE SEMINARY\r\n\r\n\r\n        Three hundred and thirty-six dinners at eighty-five\r\n        centimes. Three hundred and thirty-six suppers at fifty\r\n        centimes. Chocolate to those who are entitled to it. How\r\n        much profit can be made on the contract?--_Valenod of\r\n        Besan\xc3\xa7on_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe saw in the distance the iron gilt cross on the door. He approached\r\nslowly. His legs seemed to give way beneath him. "So here is this hell\r\nupon earth which I shall be unable to leave."\r\n\r\nFinally he made up his mind to ring. The noise of the bell reverberated\r\nas though through a solitude. At the end of ten minutes a pale man,\r\nclothed in black, came and opened the door. Julien looked at him, and\r\nimmediately lowered his eyes. This porter had a singular physiognomy.\r\nThe green projecting pupils of his eyes were as round as those of a\r\ncat. The straight lines of his eyebrows betokened the impossibility of\r\nany sympathy. His thin lips came round in a semicircle over projecting\r\nteeth. None the less, his physiognomy did not so much betoken crime\r\nas rather that perfect callousness which is so much more terrifying\r\nto the young. The one sentiment which Julien\'s rapid gaze surmised in\r\nthis long and devout face was a profound contempt for every topic of\r\nconversation which did not deal with things celestial. Julien raised\r\nhis eyes with an effort, and in a voice rendered quavering by the\r\nbeating of his heart explained that he desired to speak to M. Pirard,\r\nthe director of the Seminary. Without saying a word the man in black\r\nsigned to him to follow. They ascended two stories by a large staircase\r\nwith a wooden rail, whose warped stairs inclined to the side opposite\r\nthe wall, and seemed on the point of falling. A little door with a\r\nbig cemetery cross of white wood painted black at the top was opened\r\nwith difficulty, and the porter made him enter a dark low room, whose\r\nwhitewashed walls were decorated with two big pictures blackened by\r\nage. In this room Julien was left alone. He was overwhelmed. His heart\r\nwas beating violently. He would have been happy to have ventured to\r\ncry. A silence of death reigned over the whole house.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, which seemed a whole day to him,\r\nthe sinister looking porter reappeared on the threshold of a door at\r\nthe other end of the room, and without vouchsafing a word, signed to\r\nhim to advance. He entered into a room even larger than the first,\r\nand very badly lighted. The walls also were whitened, but there was\r\nno furniture. Only in a corner near the door Julien saw as he passed\r\na white wooden bed, two straw chairs, and a little pinewood armchair\r\nwithout any cushions. He perceived at the other end of the room, near a\r\nsmall window with yellow panes decorated with badly kept flower vases,\r\na man seated at a table, and covered with a dilapidated cassock. He\r\nappeared to be in a temper, and took one after the other a number of\r\nlittle squares of paper, which he arranged on his table after he had\r\nwritten some words on them. He did not notice Julien\'s presence. The\r\nlatter did not move, but kept standing near the centre of the room in\r\nthe place where the porter, who had gone out and shut the door, had\r\nleft him.\r\n\r\nTen minutes passed in this way: the badly dressed man kept on writing\r\nall the time. Julien\'s emotion and terror were so great that he thought\r\nhe was on the point of falling. A philosopher would have said, possibly\r\nwrongly, "It is a violent impression made by ugliness on a soul\r\nintended by nature to love the beautiful."\r\n\r\nThe man who was writing lifted up his head. Julien only perceived it\r\nafter a moment had passed, and even after seeing it, he still remained\r\nmotionless, as though struck dead by the terrible look of which he\r\nwas the victim. Julien\'s troubled eyes just managed to make out a\r\nlong face, all covered with red blotches except the forehead, which\r\nmanifested a mortal pallor. Two little black eyes, calculated to\r\nterrify the most courageous, shone between these red cheeks and that\r\nwhite forehead. The vast area of his forehead was bounded by thick,\r\nflat, jet black hair.\r\n\r\n"Will you come near, yes or no?" said the man at last, impatiently.\r\n\r\nJulien advanced with an uneasy step, and at last, paler than he had\r\never been in his life and on the point of falling, stopped three paces\r\nfrom the little white wooden table which was covered with the squares\r\nof paper.\r\n\r\n"Nearer," said the man.\r\n\r\nJulien advanced still further, holding out his hand, as though trying\r\nto lean on something.\r\n\r\n"Your name?"\r\n\r\n"Julien Sorel."\r\n\r\n"You are certainly very late," said the man to him, as he rivetted\r\nagain on him that terrible gaze.\r\n\r\nJulien could not endure this look. Holding out his hand as though to\r\nsupport himself, he fell all his length along the floor.\r\n\r\nThe man rang. Julien had only lost the use of his eyes and the power of\r\nmovement. He heard steps approaching.\r\n\r\nHe was lifted up and placed on the little armchair of white wood. He\r\nheard the terrible man saying to the porter,\r\n\r\n"He has had an epileptic fit apparently, and this is the finishing\r\ntouch."\r\n\r\nWhen Julien was able to open his eyes, the man with the red face was\r\ngoing on with his writing. The porter had disappeared. "I must have\r\ncourage," said our hero to himself, "and above all, hide what I feel."\r\nHe felt violently sick. "If anything happens to me, God knows what they\r\nwill think of me."\r\n\r\nFinally the man stopped writing and looked sideways at Julien.\r\n\r\n"Are you in a fit state to answer me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Julien in an enfeebled voice.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s fortunate."\r\n\r\nThe man in black had half got up, and was looking impatiently for a\r\nletter in the drawer of his pinewood table, which opened with a grind.\r\nHe found it, sat down slowly, and looking again at Julien in a manner\r\ncalculated to suck out of him the little life which he still possessed,\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n"You have been recommended to me by M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan. He was the best cur\xc3\xa9 in\r\nthe diocese; he was an upright man if there ever was one, and my friend\r\nfor thirty years."\r\n\r\n"Oh. It\'s to M. Pirard then that I have the honour of speaking?" said\r\nJulien in a dying voice.\r\n\r\n"Apparently," replied the director of the seminary, as he looked at him\r\ndisagreeably.\r\n\r\nThe glitter of his little eyes doubled and was followed by an\r\ninvoluntary movement of the muscles of the corner of the mouth. It\r\nwas the physiognomy of the tiger savouring in advance the pleasure of\r\ndevouring its prey.\r\n\r\n"Ch\xc3\xa9lan\'s letter is short," he said, as though speaking to himself.\r\n"_Intelligenti pauca_. In the present time it is impossible to write\r\ntoo little." He read aloud:--\r\n\r\n        "I recommend to you Julien Sorel of this parish, whom\r\n        I baptized nearly twenty years ago, the son of a rich\r\n        carpenter who gives him nothing. Julien will be a\r\n        remarkable worker in the vineyard of the Lord. He lacks\r\n        neither memory nor intelligence; he has some faculty\r\n        for reflection. Will he persevere in his calling? Is he\r\n        sincere?"\r\n\r\n"Sincere," repeated the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard with an astonished air, looking at\r\nJulien. But the abb\xc3\xa9\'s look was already less devoid of all humanity.\r\n"Sincere," he repeated, lowering his voice, and resuming his reading:--\r\n\r\n        "I ask you for a stipend for Julien Sorel. He will earn\r\n        it by passing the necessary examinations. I have taught\r\n        him a little theology, that old and good theology of the\r\n        Bossuets, the Arnaults, and the Fleury\'s. If the person\r\n        does not suit you, send him back to me. The director\r\n        of the workhouse, whom you know well, offers him eight\r\n        hundred to be tutor to his children. My inner self is\r\n        tranquil, thanks to God. I am accustoming myself to the\r\n        terrible blow, \'Vale et me ama.\'"\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, speaking more slowly as he read the signature,\r\npronounced with a sigh the word, "Ch\xc3\xa9lan."\r\n\r\n"He is tranquil," he said, "in fact his righteousness deserves such a\r\nrecompense. May God grant it to me in such a case." He looked up to\r\nheaven and made the sign of the cross. At the sight of that sacred sign\r\nJulien felt an alleviation of the profound horror which had frozen him\r\nsince his entry into the house.\r\n\r\n"I have here three hundred and twenty-one aspirants for the most holy\r\nstate," said the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard at last, in a tone, which though severe,\r\nwas not malicious; "only seven or eight have been recommended to me by\r\nsuch men as the abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan; so you will be the ninth of these among\r\nthe three hundred and twenty-one. But my protection means neither\r\nfavour nor weakness, it means doubled care, and doubled severity\r\nagainst vice. Go and lock that door."\r\n\r\nJulian made an effort to walk, and managed not to fall. He noticed that\r\na little window near the entrance door looked out on to the country.\r\nHe saw the trees; that sight did him as much good as the sight of old\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n"\'Loquerisne linquam latinam?\'" (Do you speak Latin?) said the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nPirard to him as he came back.\r\n\r\n"\'Ita, pater optime,\'" (Yes, excellent Father) answered Julien,\r\nrecovering himself a little. But it was certain that nobody in the\r\nworld had ever appeared to him less excellent than had M. Pirard for\r\nthe last half hour.\r\n\r\nThe conversation continued in Latin. The expression in the abb\xc3\xa9\'s eyes\r\nsoftened. Julien regained some self-possession. "How weak I am," he\r\nthought, "to let myself be imposed on by these appearances of virtue.\r\nThe man is probably nothing more than a rascal, like M. Maslon," and\r\nJulien congratulated himself on having hidden nearly all his money in\r\nhis boots.\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard examined Julien in theology; he was surprised at\r\nthe extent of his knowledge, but his astonishment increased when he\r\nquestioned him in particular on sacred scriptures. But when it came to\r\nquestions of the doctrines of the Fathers, he perceived that Julien\r\nscarcely even knew the names of Saint Jerome, Saint Augustin, Saint\r\nBonaventure, Saint Basile, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact," thought the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, "this is simply that\r\nfatal tendency to Protestantism for which I have always reproached\r\nCh\xc3\xa9lan. A profound, and only too profound knowledge of the Holy\r\nScriptures."\r\n\r\n(Julien had just started speaking to him, without being questioned on\r\nthe point, about the real time when Genesis, the Pentateuch, etc., has\r\nbeen written).\r\n\r\n"To what does this never-ending reasoning over the Holy Scriptures lead\r\nto?" thought the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, "if not to self-examination, that is to\r\nsay, the most awful Protestantism. And by the side of this imprudent\r\nknowledge, nothing about the Fathers to compensate for that tendency."\r\n\r\nBut the astonishment of the director of the seminary was quite\r\nunbounded when having questioned Julien about the authority of the\r\nPope, and expecting to hear the maxims of the ancient Gallican Church,\r\nthe young man recited to him the whole book of M. de Maistre "Strange\r\nman, that Ch\xc3\xa9lan," thought the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. "Did he show him the book\r\nsimply to teach him to make fun of it?"\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that he questioned Julien and endeavoured to guess if\r\nhe seriously believed in the doctrine of M. de Maistre. The young man\r\nonly answered what he had learnt by heart. From this moment Julien was\r\nreally happy. He felt that he was master of himself. After a very long\r\nexamination, it seemed to him that M. Pirard\'s severity towards him was\r\nonly affected. Indeed, the director of the seminary would have embraced\r\nJulien in the name of logic, for he found so much clearness, precision\r\nand lucidity in his answers, had it not been for the principles of\r\naustere gravity towards his theology pupils which he had inculcated in\r\nhimself for the last fifteen years.\r\n\r\n"Here we have a bold and healthy mind," he said to himself, "but corpus\r\ndebile" (the body is weak).\r\n\r\n"Do you often fall like that?" he said to Julien in French, pointing\r\nwith his finger to the floor.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the first time in my life. The porter\'s face unnerved me," added\r\nJulien, blushing like a child. The abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard almost smiled.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the result of vain worldly pomp. You are apparently accustomed\r\nto smiling faces, those veritable theatres of falsehood. Truth is\r\naustere, Monsieur, but is not our task down here also austere? You must\r\nbe careful that your conscience guards against that weakness of yours,\r\ntoo much sensibility to vain external graces."\r\n\r\n"If you had not been recommended to me," said the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, resuming\r\nthe Latin language with an obvious pleasure, "If you had not been\r\nrecommended by a man, by the abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan, I would talk to you the vain\r\nlanguage of that world, to which it would appear you are only too well\r\naccustomed. I would tell you that the full stipend which you solicit\r\nis the most difficult thing in the world to obtain. But the fifty-six\r\nyears which the abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan has spent in apostolic work have stood him\r\nin poor stead if he cannot dispose of a stipend at the seminary."\r\n\r\nAfter these words, the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard recommended Julien not to enter any\r\nsecret society or congregation without his consent.\r\n\r\n"I give you my word of honour," said Julien, with all an honest man\'s\r\nexpansion of heart. The director of the seminary smiled for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"That expression is not used here," he said to him. "It is too\r\nreminiscent of that vain honour of worldly people, which leads them to\r\nso many errors and often to so many crimes. You owe me obedience by\r\nvirtue of paragraph seventeen of the bull Unam Eccesiam of St. Pius the\r\nFifth. I am your ecclesiastical superior. To hear in this house, my\r\ndear son, is to obey. How much money, have you?"\r\n\r\n("So here we are," said Julien to himself, "that was the reason of the\r\n\'my very dear son\')."\r\n\r\n"Thirty-five francs, my father."\r\n\r\n"Write out carefully how you use that money. You will have to give me\r\nan account of it."\r\n\r\nThis painful audience had lasted three hours. Julien summoned the\r\nporter.\r\n\r\n"Go and install Julien Sorel in cell No. 103," said the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard to\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nAs a great favour he let Julien have a place all to himself. "Carry his\r\nbox there," he added.\r\n\r\nJulien lowered his eyes, and recognised his box just in front of him.\r\nHe had been looking at it for three hours and had not recognised it.\r\n\r\nAs he arrived at No. 103, which was a little room eight feet square on\r\nthe top story of the house, Julien noticed that it looked out on to the\r\nramparts, and he perceived beyond them the pretty plain which the Doubs\r\ndivides from the town.\r\n\r\n"What a charming view!" exclaimed Julien. In speaking like this he did\r\nnot feel what the words actually expressed. The violent sensations\r\nwhich he had experienced during the short time that he had been at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on had absolutely exhausted his strength. He sat down near the\r\nwindow on the one wooden chair in the cell, and fell at once into a\r\nprofound sleep. He did not hear either the supper bell or the bell for\r\nbenediction. They had forgotten him. When the first rays of the sun\r\nwoke him up the following morning, he found himself lying on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD, OR WHAT THE RICH LACK\r\n\r\n\r\n        I am alone in the world. No one deigns to spare me\r\n        a thought. All those whom I see make their fortune,\r\n        have an insolence and hardness of heart which I do not\r\n        feel in myself. They hate me by reason of kindness\r\n        and good-humour. Oh, I shall die soon, either from\r\n        starvation or the unhappiness of seeing men so hard of\r\n        heart.--_Young_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe hastened to brush his clothes and run down. He was late. Instead of\r\ntrying to justify himself Julien crossed his arms over his breast.\r\n\r\n"Peccavi pater optime (I have sinned, I confess my fault, oh, my\r\nfather)," he said with a contrite air.\r\n\r\nThis first speech was a great success. The clever ones among the\r\nseminarists saw that they had to deal with a man who knew something\r\nabout the elements of the profession. The recreation hour arrived, and\r\nJulien saw that he was the object of general curiosity, but he only\r\nmanifested reserved silence. Following the maxims he had laid down for\r\nhimself, he considered his three hundred and twenty-one comrades as\r\nenemies. The most dangerous of all in his eyes was the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. A\r\nfew days afterwards Julien had to choose a confessor, and was given a\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n"Great heavens! what do they take me for?" he said to himself. "Do they\r\nthink I don\'t understand what\'s what?" Then he chose the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard.\r\n\r\nThis step proved decisive without his suspecting it.\r\n\r\nA little seminarist, who was quite young and a native of Verri\xc3\xa8res, and\r\nwho had declared himself his friend since the first day, informed him\r\nthat he would probably have acted more prudently if he had chosen M.\r\nCastan\xc3\xa8de, the sub-director of the seminary.\r\n\r\n"The abb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de is the enemy of Pirard, who is suspected of\r\nJansenism," added the little seminarist in a whisper. All the first\r\nsteps of our hero were, in spite of the prudence on which he plumed\r\nhimself, as much mistakes as his choice of a confessor. Misled as he\r\nwas by all the self-confidence of a man of imagination, he took his\r\nprojects for facts, and believed that he was a consummate hypocrite.\r\nHis folly went so far as to reproach himself for his success in this\r\nkind of weakness.\r\n\r\n"Alas, it is my only weapon," he said to himself. "At another period I\r\nshould have earned my livelihood by eloquent deeds in the face of the\r\nenemy."\r\n\r\nSatisfied as he was with his own conduct, Julien looked around him. He\r\nfound everywhere the appearance of the purest virtue.\r\n\r\nEight or ten seminarists lived in the odour of sanctity, and had\r\nvisions like Saint Theresa, and Saint Francis, when he received his\r\nstigmata on Mount _Vernia_ in the Appenines. But it was a great secret\r\nand their friends concealed it. These poor young people who had\r\nvisions were always in the infirmary. A hundred others combined an\r\nindefatigable application to a robust faith. They worked till they fell\r\nill, but without learning much. Two or three were distinguished by a\r\nreal talent, amongst others a student of the name of Chazel, but both\r\nthey and Julien felt mutually unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nThe rest of these three hundred and twenty-one seminarists consisted\r\nexclusively of coarse persons, who were by no means sure of\r\nunderstanding the Latin words which they kept on repeating the livelong\r\nday. Nearly all were the sons of peasants, and they preferred to gain\r\ntheir livelihood by reciting some Latin words than by ploughing the\r\nearth. It was after this examination of his colleagues that Julien,\r\nduring the first few days, promised himself a speedy success.\r\n\r\n"Intelligent people are needed in every service," he said to himself,\r\n"for, after all, there is work to be done. I should have been a\r\nsergeant under Napoleon. I shall be a grand vicar among these future\r\ncur\xc3\xa9s."\r\n\r\n"All these poor devils," he added, "manual labourers as they have been\r\nsince their childhood, have lived on curded milk and black bread up\r\ntill they arrived here. They would only eat meat five or six times a\r\nyear in their hovels. Like the Roman soldiers who used to find war the\r\ntime of rest, these poor peasants are enchanted with the delights of\r\nthe seminary."\r\n\r\nJulien could never read anything in their gloomy eyes but the\r\nsatisfaction of physical craving after dinner, and the expectation\r\nof sensual pleasure before the meal. Such were the people among whom\r\nJulien had to distinguish himself; but the fact which he did not know,\r\nand which they refrained from telling him, was that coming out first\r\nin the different courses of dogma, ecclesiastical history, etc., etc.,\r\nwhich are taken at the seminary, constituted in their eyes, neither\r\nmore nor less than a splendid sin.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Voltaire and two-chamber Government, which is at\r\nbottom simply distrust and personal self-examination, and gives the\r\npopular mind that bad habit of being suspicious, the Church of France\r\nseems to have realised that books are its real enemies. It is the\r\nsubmissive heart which counts for everything in its eyes. It suspects,\r\nand rightly so, any success in studies, even sacred ones. What is to\r\nprevent a superior man from crossing over to the opposite side like\r\nSi\xc3\xa8yes or Gregory. The trembling Church clings on to the Pope as its\r\none chance of safety. The Pope alone is in a position to attempt to\r\nparalyse all personal self-examination, and to make an impression by\r\nmeans of the pompous piety of his court ceremonial on the bored and\r\nmorbid spirit of fashionable society.\r\n\r\nJulien, as he began to get some glimpse of these various truths,\r\nwhich are none the less in total contradiction to all the official\r\npronouncements of any seminary, fell into a profound melancholy. He\r\nworked a great deal and rapidly succeeded in learning things which were\r\nextremely useful to a priest, extremely false in his own eyes, and\r\ndevoid of the slightest interest for him. He felt there was nothing\r\nelse to do.\r\n\r\n"Am I then forgotten by the whole world," he thought. He did not know\r\nthat M. Pirard had received and thrown into the fire several letters\r\nwith the Dijon stamp in which the most lively passion would pierce\r\nthrough the most formal conventionalism of style. "This love seems to\r\nbe fought by great attacks of remorse. All the better," thought the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. "At any rate this lad has not loved an infidel woman."\r\n\r\nOne day the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard opened a letter which seemed half-blotted out\r\nby tears. It was an adieu for ever. "At last," said the writer to\r\nJulien, "Heaven has granted me the grace of hating, not the author of\r\nmy fall, but my fall itself. The sacrifice has been made, dear one, not\r\nwithout tears as you see. The safety of those to whom I must devote\r\nmy life, and whom you love so much, is the decisive factor. A just\r\nbut terrible God will no longer see His way to avenge on them their\r\nmother\'s crimes. Adieu, Julien. Be just towards all men." The end of\r\nthe letter was nearly entirely illegible. The writer gave an address at\r\nDijon, but at the same time expressed the hope that Julien would not\r\nanswer, or at any rate would employ language which a reformed woman\r\ncould read without blushing. Julien\'s melancholy, aggravated by the\r\nmediocre nourishment which the contractor who gave dinners at thirteen\r\ncentimes per head supplied to the seminary, began to affect his health,\r\nwhen Fouqu\xc3\xa9 suddenly appeared in his room one morning.\r\n\r\n"I have been able to get in at last. I have duly been five times to\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on in order to see you. Could never get in. I put someone by the\r\ndoor to watch. Why the devil don\'t you ever go out?"\r\n\r\n"It is a test which I have imposed on myself."\r\n\r\n"I find you greatly changed, but here you are again. I have just\r\nlearned from a couple of good five franc pieces that I was only a fool\r\nnot to have offered them on my first journey."\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the two friends went on for ever. Julien changed\r\ncolour when Fouqu\xc3\xa9 said to him,\r\n\r\n"Do you know, by the by, that your pupils\' mother has become positively\r\ndevout."\r\n\r\nAnd he began to talk in that off-hand manner which makes so singular an\r\nimpression on the passionate soul, whose dearest interests are being\r\ndestroyed without the speaker having the faintest suspicion of it.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my friend, the most exalted devoutness. She is said to make\r\npilgrimages. But to the eternal shame of the abb\xc3\xa9 Maslon, who has\r\nplayed the spy so long on that poor M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan, Madame de R\xc3\xaanal would\r\nhave nothing to do with him. She goes to confession to Dijon or\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on."\r\n\r\n"She goes to Besan\xc3\xa7on," said Julien, flushing all over his forehead.\r\n\r\n"Pretty often," said Fouqu\xc3\xa9 in a questioning manner.\r\n\r\n"Have you got any _Constitutionnels_ on you?"\r\n\r\n"What do you say?" replied Fouqu\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n"I\'m asking if you\'ve got any _Constitutionnels_?" went on Julien\r\nin the quietest tone imaginable. "They cost thirty sous a number here."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Fouqu\xc3\xa9. "Liberals even in the seminary! Poor France,"\r\nhe added, assuming the abb\xc3\xa9 Maslon\'s hypocritical voice and sugary tone.\r\n\r\nThis visit would have made a deep impression on our hero, if he had not\r\nbeen put on the track of an important discovery by some words addressed\r\nto him the following day by the little seminarist from Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\nJulien\'s conduct since he had been at the seminary had been nothing but\r\na series of false steps. He began to make bitter fun of himself.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact the important actions in his life had been cleverly\r\nmanaged, but he was careless about details, and cleverness in a\r\nseminary consists in attention to details. Consequently, he had already\r\nthe reputation among his comrades of being a _strong-minded person._ He\r\nhad been betrayed by a number of little actions.\r\n\r\nHe had been convicted in their eyes of this enormity, _he thought and\r\njudged for himself_ instead of blindly following authority and example.\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard had been no help to him. He had not spoken to him\r\non a single occasion apart from the confessional, and even there he\r\nlistened more than he spoke. Matters would have been very different if\r\nhe had chosen the abb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de. The moment that Julien realised his\r\nfolly, he ceased to be bored. He wished to know the whole extent of the\r\nevil, and to effect this emerged a little from that haughty obstinate\r\nsilence with which he had scrupulously rebuffed his comrades. It was\r\nnow that they took their revenge on him. His advances were welcomed by\r\na contempt verging on derision. He realised that there had not been one\r\nsingle hour from the time of his entry into the seminary, particularly\r\nduring recreation time, which had not resulted in affecting him one\r\nway or another, which had not increased the number of his enemies, or\r\nwon for him the goodwill of some seminarist who was either sincerely\r\nvirtuous or of a fibre slightly less coarse than that of the others.\r\nThe evil to repair was infinite, and the task very difficult.\r\nHenceforth, Julien\'s attention was always on guard. The problem before\r\nhim was to map out a new character for himself.\r\n\r\nThe moving of his eyes for example, occasioned him a great deal of\r\ntrouble. It is with good reason that they are carried lowered in these\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n"How presumptuous I was at Verri\xc3\xa8res," said Julien to himself. "I\r\nthought I lived; I was only preparing for life, and here I am at last\r\nin the world such as I shall find it, until my part comes to an end,\r\nsurrounded by real enemies. What immense difficulties," he added,\r\n"are involved in keeping up this hypocrisy every single minute. It is\r\nenough to put the labours of Hercules into the shade. The Hercules of\r\nmodern times is the Pope Sixtus Quintus, who deceived by his modesty\r\nfifteen years on end forty Cardinals who had seen the liveliness and\r\nhaughtiness of his whole youth.\r\n\r\n"So knowledge is nothing here," he said to himself with disgust.\r\n"Progress in doctrine, in sacred history, etc., only seem to count.\r\nEverything said on those subjects is only intended to entrap fools like\r\nme. Alas my only merit consists in my rapid progress, and in the way in\r\nwhich I grasp all their nonsense. Do they really value those things at\r\ntheir true worth? Do they judge them like I do. And I had the stupidity\r\nto be proud of my quickness. The only result of my coming out top has\r\nbeen to give me inveterate enemies. Chazel, who really knows more than\r\nI do, always throws some blunder in his compositions which gets him put\r\nback to the fiftieth place. If he comes out first, it is only because\r\nhe is absent-minded. O how useful would one word, just one word, of M.\r\nPirard, have been to me."\r\n\r\nAs soon as Julien was disillusioned, the long exercises in ascetic\r\npiety, such as the attendances in the chapel five times a week, the\r\nintonation of hymns at the chapel of the Sacr\xc3\xa9 C\xc5\x93ur, etc., etc.,\r\nwhich had previously seemed to him so deadly boring, became his most\r\ninteresting opportunities for action. Thanks to a severe introspection,\r\nand above all, by trying not to overdo his methods, Julien did not\r\nattempt at the outset to perform significant actions (that is to say,\r\nactions which are proof of a certain Christian perfection) like those\r\nseminarists who served as a model to the rest.\r\n\r\nSeminarists have a special way, even of eating a poached egg, which\r\nbetokens progress in the devout life.\r\n\r\nThe reader who smiles at this will perhaps be good enough to remember\r\nall the mistakes which the abb\xc3\xa9 Delille made over the eating of an egg\r\nwhen he was invited to breakfast with a lady of the Court of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nJulien first tried to arrive at the state of _non culpa_, that is\r\nto say the state of the young seminarist whose demeanour and manner\r\nof moving his arms, eyes, etc. while in fact without any trace of\r\nworldliness, do not yet indicate that the person is entirely absorbed\r\nby the conception of the other world, and the idea of the pure\r\nnothingness of this one.\r\n\r\nJulien incessantly found such phrases as these charcoaled on the walls\r\nof the corridors. "What are sixty years of ordeals balanced against\r\nan eternity of delights or any eternity of boiling oil in hell?" He\r\ndespised them no longer. He realised that it was necessary to have them\r\nincessantly before his eyes. "What am I going to do all my life," he\r\nsaid to himself. "I shall sell to the faithful a place in heaven. How\r\nam I going to make that place visible to their eyes? By the difference\r\nbetween my appearance and that of a layman."\r\n\r\nAfter several months of absolutely unremitting application, Julien\r\nstill had the appearance of thinking. The way in which he would move\r\nhis eyes and hold his mouth did not betoken that implicit faith which\r\nis ready to believe everything and undergo everything, even at the cost\r\nof martyrdom. Julien saw with anger that he was surpassed in this by\r\nthe coarsest peasants. There was good reason for their not appearing\r\nfull of thought.\r\n\r\nWhat pains did he not take to acquire that facial expression of blindly\r\nfervent faith which is found so frequently in the Italian convents,\r\nand of which Le Guerchin has left such perfect models in his Church\r\npictures for the benefit of us laymen.\r\n\r\nOn feast-days, the seminarists were regaled with sausages and cabbage.\r\nJulien\'s table neighbours observed that he did not appreciate this\r\nhappiness. That was looked upon as one of his paramount crimes.\r\nHis comrades saw in this a most odious trait, and the most foolish\r\nhypocrisy. Nothing made him more enemies.\r\n\r\n"Look at this bourgeois, look at this stuck-up person," they would\r\nsay, "who pretends to despise the best rations there are, sausages and\r\ncabbage, shame on the villain! The haughty wretch, he is damned for\r\never."\r\n\r\n"Alas, these young peasants, who are my comrades, find their ignorance\r\nan immense advantage," Julien would exclaim in his moments of\r\ndiscouragement. "The professor has not got to deliver them on their\r\narrival at the seminary from that awful number of worldly ideas which I\r\nbrought into it, and which they read on my face whatever I do."\r\n\r\nJulien watched with an attention bordering on envy the coarsest of the\r\nlittle peasants who arrived at the seminary. From the moment when they\r\nwere made to doff their shabby jackets to don the black robe, their\r\neducation consisted of an immense and limitless respect for _hard\r\nliquid cash_ as they say in Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nThat is the consecrated and heroic way of expressing the sublime idea\r\nof current money.\r\n\r\nThese seminarists, like the heroes in Voltaire\'s novels, found their\r\nhappiness in dining well. Julien discovered in nearly all of them\r\nan innate respect for the man who wears a suit of good cloth. This\r\nsentiment appreciates the distributive justice, which is given us at\r\nour courts, at its value or even above its true value. "What can one\r\ngain," they would often repeat among themselves, "by having a law suit\r\nwith \'a big man?\'"\r\n\r\nThat is the expression current in the valleys of the Jura to express\r\na rich man. One can judge of their respect for the richest entity\r\nof all--the government. Failure to smile deferentially at the mere\r\nname of M. the Prefect is regarded as an imprudence in the eyes of\r\nthe Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9 peasant, and imprudence in poor people is quickly\r\npunished by lack of bread.\r\n\r\nAfter having been almost suffocated at first by his feeling of\r\ncontempt, Julien eventually experienced a feeling of pity; it often\r\nhappened that the fathers of most of his comrades would enter their\r\nhovel in winter evenings and fail to find there either bread, chestnuts\r\nor potatoes.\r\n\r\n"What is there astonishing then?" Julien would say to himself, "if in\r\ntheir eyes the happy man is in the first place the one who has just had\r\na good dinner, and in the second place the one who possesses a good\r\nsuit? My comrades have a lasting vocation, that is to say, they see\r\nin the ecclesiastical calling a long continuance of the happiness of\r\ndining well and having a warm suit."\r\n\r\nJulien happened to hear a young imaginative seminarist say to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I become Pope like Sixtus Quintus who kept pigs?"\r\n\r\n"They only make Italians Popes," answered his friend. "But they will\r\ncertainly draw lots amongst us for the great vicarships, canonries and\r\nperhaps bishoprics. M. P---- Bishop of Ch\xc3\xa2lons, is the son of a cooper.\r\nThat\'s what my father is."\r\n\r\nOne day, in the middle of a theology lesson, the Abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard summoned\r\nJulien to him. The young fellow was delighted to leave the dark, moral\r\natmosphere in which he had been plunged. Julien received from the\r\ndirector the same welcome which had frightened him so much on the first\r\nday of his entry.\r\n\r\n"Explain to me what is written on this playing card?" he said, looking\r\nat him in a way calculated to make him sink into the earth.\r\n\r\nJulien read:\r\n\r\n"Amanda Binet of the Giraffe Caf\xc3\xa9 before eight o\'clock. Say you\'re from\r\nGenlis, and my mother\'s cousin."\r\n\r\nJulien realised the immense danger. The spies of the abb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de had\r\nstolen the address.\r\n\r\n"I was trembling with fear the day I came here," he answered, looking\r\nat the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard\'s forehead, for he could not endure that terrible\r\ngaze. "M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan told me that this is a place of informers and\r\nmischief-makers of all kinds, and that spying and tale-bearing by one\r\ncomrade on another was encouraged by the authorities. Heaven wishes it\r\nto be so, so as to show life such as it is to the young priests, and\r\nfill them with disgust for the world and all its pomps."\r\n\r\n"And it\'s to me that you make these fine speeches," said the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nPirard furiously. "You young villain."\r\n\r\n"My brothers used to beat me at Verri\xc3\xa8res," answered Julien coldly,\r\n"When they had occasion to be jealous of me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed," exclaimed M. Pirard, almost beside himself.\r\n\r\nJulien went on with his story without being in the least intimidated:--\r\n\r\n"The day of my arrival at Besan\xc3\xa7on I was hungry, and I entered a\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9. My spirit was full of revulsion for so profane a place, but I\r\nthought that my breakfast would cost me less than at an inn. A lady,\r\nwho seemed to be the mistress of the establishment, took pity on my\r\ninexperience. \'Besan\xc3\xa7on is full of bad characters,\' she said to me. \'I\r\nfear something will happen to you, sir. If some mishap should occur to\r\nyou, have recourse to me and send to my house before eight o\'clock. If\r\nthe porters of the seminary refuse to execute your errand, say you are\r\nmy cousin and a native of Genlis.\'"\r\n\r\n"I will have all this chatter verified," exclaimed the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard,\r\nunable to stand still, and walking about the room.\r\n\r\n"Back to the cell."\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 followed Julien and locked him in. The latter immediately\r\nbegan to examine his trunk, at the bottom of which the fatal cards had\r\nbeen so carefully hidden. Nothing was missing in the trunk, but several\r\nthings had been disarranged. Nevertheless, he had never been without\r\nthe key. What luck that, during the whole time of my blindness, said\r\nJulien to himself, I never availed myself of the permission to go out\r\nthat Monsieur Castan\xc3\xa8de would offer me so frequently, with a kindness\r\nwhich I now understand. Perhaps I should have had the weakness to have\r\nchanged my clothes and gone to see the fair Amanda, and then I should\r\nhave been ruined. When they gave up hope of exploiting that piece of\r\ninformation for the accomplishment of his ruin, they had used it to\r\ninform against him. Two hours afterwards the director summoned him.\r\n\r\n"You did not lie," he said to him, with a less severe look, "but\r\nkeeping an address like that is an indiscretion of a gravity which you\r\nare unable to realise. Unhappy child! It may perhaps do you harm in ten\r\nyears\' time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nFIRST EXPERIENCE OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n        The present time, Great God! is the ark of the Lord;\r\n        cursed be he who touches it.--_Diderot_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will kindly excuse us if we give very few clear and definite\r\nfacts concerning this period of Julien\'s life. It is not that we\r\nlack facts; quite the contrary. But it may be that what he saw in\r\nthe seminary is too black for the medium colour which the author\r\nhas endeavoured to preserve throughout these pages. Those of our\r\ncontemporaries who have suffered from certain things cannot remember\r\nthem without a horror which paralyses every other pleasure, even that\r\nof reading a tale.\r\n\r\nJulien achieved scant success in his essays at hypocritical gestures.\r\nHe experienced moments of disgust, and even of complete discouragement.\r\nHe was not a success, even in a a vile career. The slightest help\r\nfrom outside would have sufficed to have given him heart again, for\r\nthe difficulty to overcome was not very great, but he was alone, like\r\na derelict ship in the middle of the ocean. "And when I do succeed,"\r\nhe would say to himself, "think of having to pass a whole lifetime in\r\nsuch awful company, gluttons who have no thought but for the large\r\nomelette which they will guzzle at dinner-time, or persons like the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de, who finds no crime too black! They will attain power,\r\nbut, great heavens! at what cost.\r\n\r\n"The will of man is powerful, I read it everywhere, but is it enough to\r\novercome so great a disgust? The task of all the great men was easy by\r\ncomparison. However terrible was the danger, they found it fine, and\r\nwho can realise, except myself, the ugliness of my surroundings?"\r\n\r\nThis moment was the most trying in his whole life. It would have been\r\nso easy for him to have enlisted in one of the fine regiments at the\r\ngarrison of Besan\xc3\xa7on. He could have become a Latin master. He needed so\r\nlittle for his subsistence, but in that case no more career, no more\r\nfuture for his imagination. It was equivalent to death. Here is one of\r\nhis sad days in detail:\r\n\r\n"I have so often presumed to congratulate myself on being different\r\nfrom the other young peasants! Well, I have lived enough to realise\r\nthat _difference engenders hate_," he said to himself one morning.\r\nThis great truth had just been borne in upon him by one of his most\r\nirritating failures. He had been working for eight days at teaching a\r\npupil who lived in an odour of sanctity. He used to go out with him\r\ninto the courtyard and listen submissively to pieces of fatuity enough\r\nto send one to sleep standing. Suddenly the weather turned stormy. The\r\nthunder growled, and the holy pupil exclaimed as he roughly pushed him\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Listen! Everyone for himself in this world. I don\'t want to be burned\r\nby the thunder. God may strike you with lightning like a blasphemer,\r\nlike a Voltaire."\r\n\r\n"I deserve to be drowned if I go to sleep during the storm," exclaimed\r\nJulien, with his teeth clenched with rage, and with his eyes opened\r\ntowards the sky now furrowed by the lightning. "Let us try the conquest\r\nof some other rogue."\r\n\r\nThe bell rang for the abb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de\'s course of sacred history. That\r\nday the abb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de was teaching those young peasants already\r\nso frightened by their father\'s hardships and poverty, that the\r\nGovernment, that entity so terrible in their eyes, possessed no real\r\nand legitimate power except by virtue of the delegation of God\'s vicar\r\non earth.\r\n\r\n"Render yourselves worthy, by the holiness of your life and by your\r\nobedience, of the benevolence of the Pope. Be _like a stick in his\r\nhands_," he added, "and you will obtain a superb position, where you\r\nwill be far from all control, and enjoy the King\'s commands, a position\r\nfrom which you cannot be removed, and where one-third of the salary\r\nis paid by the Government, while the faithful who are moulded by your\r\npreaching pay the other two-thirds."\r\n\r\nCastan\xc3\xa8de stopped in the courtyard after he left the lesson-room. "It\r\nis particularly appropriate to say of a cur\xc3\xa9," he said to the pupils\r\nwho formed a ring round him, "that the place is worth as much as the\r\nman is worth. I myself have known parishes in the mountains where the\r\nsurplice fees were worth more than that of many town livings. There was\r\nquite as much money, without counting the fat capons, the eggs, fresh\r\nbutter, and a thousand and one pleasant details, and there the cur\xc3\xa9 is\r\nindisputably the first man. There is not a good meal to which he is not\r\ninvited, f\xc3\xaated, etc."\r\n\r\nCastan\xc3\xa8de had scarcely gone back to his room before the pupils split up\r\ninto knots. Julien did not form part of any of them; he was left out\r\nlike a black sheep. He saw in every knot a pupil tossing a coin in the\r\nair, and if he managed to guess right in this game of heads or tails,\r\nhis comrades would decide that he would soon have one of those fat\r\nlivings.\r\n\r\nAnecdotes ensued. A certain young priest, who had scarcely been\r\nordained a year, had given a tame rabbit to the maidservant of an old\r\ncur\xc3\xa9, and had succeeded in being asked to be his curate. In a few\r\nmonths afterwards, for the cur\xc3\xa9 had quickly died, he had replaced him\r\nin that excellent living. Another had succeeded in getting himself\r\ndesignated as a successor to a very rich town living, by being present\r\nat all the meals of an old, paralytic cur\xc3\xa9, and by dexterously carving\r\nhis poultry. The seminarists, like all young people, exaggerated the\r\neffect of those little devices, which have an element of originality,\r\nand which strike the imagination.\r\n\r\n"I must take part in these conversations," said Julien to himself. When\r\nthey did not talk about sausages and good livings, the conversation ran\r\non the worldly aspect of ecclesiastical doctrine, on the differences of\r\nbishops and prefects, of mayors and cur\xc3\xa9s. Julien caught sight of the\r\nconception of a second god, but of a god who was much more formidable\r\nand much more powerful than the other one. That second god was the\r\nPope. They said among themselves, in a low voice, however, and when\r\nthey were quite sure that they would not be heard by Pirard, that\r\nthe reason for the Pope not taking the trouble of nominating all the\r\nprefects and mayors of France, was that he had entrusted that duty to\r\nthe King of France by entitling him a senior son of the Church.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Julien thought he could exploit, for the\r\nbenefit of his own reputation, his knowledge of De Maistre\'s book\r\non the Pope. In point of fact, he did astonish his comrades, but it\r\nwas only another misfortune. He displeased them by expounding their\r\nown opinions better than they could themselves. Ch\xc3\xa9lan had acted as\r\nimprudently for Julien as he had for himself. He had given him the\r\nhabit of reasoning correctly, and of not being put off by empty words,\r\nbut he had neglected to tell him that this habit was a crime in the\r\nperson of no importance, since every piece of logical reasoning is\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s command of language added consequently a new crime to his\r\nscore. By dint of thinking about him, his colleagues succeeded in\r\nexpressing the horror with which he would inspire them by a single\r\nexpression; they nicknamed him Martin Luther, "particularly," they\r\nsaid, "because of that infernal logic which makes him so proud."\r\n\r\nSeveral young seminarists had a fresher complexion than Julien, and\r\ncould pass as better-looking, but he had white hands, and was unable to\r\nconceal certain refined habits of personal cleanliness. This advantage\r\nproved a disadvantage in the gloomy house in which chance had cast\r\nhim. The dirty peasants among whom he lived asserted that he had very\r\nabandoned morals. We fear that we may weary our reader by a narration\r\nof the thousand and one misfortunes of our hero. The most vigorous of\r\nhis comrades, for example, wanted to start the custom of beating him.\r\nHe was obliged to arm himself with an iron compass, and to indicate,\r\nthough by signs, that he would make use of it. Signs cannot figure in a\r\nspy\'s report to such good advantage as words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nA PROCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n        All hearts were moved. The presence of God seemed to\r\n        have descended into these narrow Gothic streets that\r\n        stretched in every direction, and were sanded by the\r\n        care of the faithful.--_Young_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Julien pretended to be petty and stupid. He could\r\nnot please; he was too different. Yet all these professors, he said to\r\nhimself, are very clever people, men in a thousand. Why do they not\r\nlike my humility? Only one seemed to take advantage of his readiness\r\nto believe everything, and apparently to swallow everything. This was\r\nthe abb\xc3\xa9 Chas-Bernard, the director of the ceremonies of the cathedral,\r\nwhere, for the last fifteen years, he had been given occasion to hope\r\nfor a canonry. While waiting, he taught homiletics at the seminary.\r\nDuring the period of Julien\'s blindness, this class was one of those in\r\nwhich he most frequently came out top. The abb\xc3\xa9 Chas had used this as\r\nan opportunity to manifest some friendship to him, and when the class\r\nbroke up, he would be glad to take him by the arm for some turns in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n"What is he getting at," Julien would say to himself. He noticed\r\nwith astonishment that, for hours on end, the abb\xc3\xa9 would talk to him\r\nabout the ornaments possessed by the cathedral. It had seventeen lace\r\nchasubles, besides the mourning vestments. A lot was hoped from the old\r\nwife of the judge de Rubempr\xc3\xa9. This lady, who was ninety years of age,\r\nhad kept for at least seventy years her wedding dress of superb Lyons\r\nmaterial, embroidered with gold.\r\n\r\n"Imagine, my friend," the abb\xc3\xa9 Chas would say, stopping abruptly, and\r\nstaring with amazement, "that this material keeps quite stiff. There\r\nis so much gold in it. It is generally thought in Besan\xc3\xa7on that the\r\nwill of the judge\'s wife will result in the cathedral treasure being\r\nincreased by more than ten chasubles, without counting four or five\r\ncapes for the great feast. I will go further," said the abb\xc3\xa9 Chas,\r\nlowering his voice, "I have reasons for thinking the judge\'s wife will\r\nleave us her magnificent silver gilt candlesticks, supposed to have\r\nbeen bought in Italy by Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, whose\r\nfavourite minister was one of the good lady\'s ancestors."\r\n\r\n"But what is the fellow getting at with all this old clothes business,"\r\nthought Julien. "These adroit preliminaries have been going on for\r\ncenturies, and nothing comes of them. He must be very suspicious of me.\r\nHe is cleverer than all the others, whose secret aim can be guessed so\r\neasily in a fortnight. I understand. He must have been suffering for\r\nfifteen years from mortified ambition."\r\n\r\nJulien was summoned one evening in the middle of the fencing lesson to\r\nthe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, who said to him.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow is the feast of Corpus Domini (the F\xc3\xaate Dieu) the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nChas-Bernard needs you to help him to decorate the cathedral. Go and\r\nobey." The abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard called him back and added sympathetically. "It\r\ndepends on you whether you will utilise the occasion to go into the\r\ntown."\r\n\r\n"Incedo per ignes," answered Julien. (I have secret enemies).\r\n\r\nJulien went to the cathedral next morning with downcast eyes. The sight\r\nof the streets and the activity which was beginning to prevail in the\r\ntown did him good. In all quarters they were extending the fronts of\r\nthe houses for the procession.\r\n\r\nAll the time that he had passed in the seminary seemed to him no more\r\nthan a moment. His thoughts were of Vergy, and of the pretty Amanda\r\nwhom he might perhaps meet, for her caf\xc3\xa9 was not very far off. He saw\r\nin the distance the abb\xc3\xa9 Chas-Bernard on the threshold of his beloved\r\ncathedral. He was a big man with a jovial face and a frank air. To-day\r\nhe looked triumphant. "I was expecting you, my dear son," he cried as\r\nsoon as he saw Julien in the distance. "Be welcome. This day\'s duty\r\nwill be protracted and arduous. Let us fortify ourselves by a first\r\nbreakfast. We will have the second at ten o\'clock during high mass."\r\n\r\n"I do not wish, sir," said Julien to him gravely, "to be alone for a\r\nsingle instant. Deign to observe," he added, showing him the clock over\r\ntheir heads, "that I have arrived at one minute to five."\r\n\r\n"So those little rascals at the seminary frightened you. It is very\r\ngood of you to think of them," said the abb\xc3\xa9. "But is the road less\r\nbeautiful because there are thorns in the hedges which border it.\r\nTravellers go on their way, and leave the wicked thorns to wait in vain\r\nwhere they are. And now to work my dear friend, to work."\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Chas was right in saying that the task would be arduous. There\r\nhad been a great funeral ceremony at the cathedral the previous day.\r\nThey had not been able to make any preparations. They had consequently\r\nonly one morning for dressing all the Gothic pillars which constitute\r\nthe three naves with a kind of red damask cloth ascending to a height\r\nof thirty feet. The Bishop had fetched by mail four decorators from\r\nParis, but these gentry were not able to do everything, and far from\r\ngiving any encouragement to the clumsiness of the Besan\xc3\xa7on colleagues,\r\nthey made it twice as great by making fun of them.\r\n\r\nJulien saw that he would have to climb the ladder himself. His agility\r\nserved him in good stead. He undertook the direction of the decorators\r\nfrom town. The Abb\xc3\xa9 Chas was delighted as he watched him flit from\r\nladder to ladder. When all the pillars were dressed in damask, five\r\nenormous bouquets of feathers had to be placed on the great baldachin\r\nabove the grand altar. A rich coping of gilded wood was supported by\r\neight big straight columns of Italian marble, but to reach the centre\r\nof the baldachin above the tabernacle involved walking over an old\r\nwooden cornice which was forty feet high and possibly worm-eaten.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this difficult crossing had extinguished the gaiety of the\r\nParisian decorators, which up till then had been so brilliant. They\r\nlooked at it from down below, argued a great deal, but did not go up.\r\nJulien seized hold of the bouquets of feathers and climbed the ladder\r\nat a run. He placed it neatly on the crown-shaped ornament in the\r\ncentre of the baldachin. When he came down the ladder again, the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nChas-Bernard embraced him in his arms.\r\n\r\n"Optime" exclaimed the good priest, "I will tell this to Monseigneur."\r\n\r\nBreakfast at ten o\'clock was very gay. The abb\xc3\xa9 Chas had never seen his\r\nchurch look so beautiful.\r\n\r\n"Dear disciple," he said to Julien. "My mother used to let out chairs\r\nin this venerable building, so I have been brought up in this great\r\nedifice. The Terror of Robespierre ruined us, but when I was eight\r\nyears old, that was my age then, I used to serve masses in private\r\nhouses, so you see I got my meals on mass-days. Nobody could fold a\r\nchasuble better than I could, and I never cut the fringes. After the\r\nre-establishment of public worship by Napoleon, I had the good fortune\r\nto direct everything in this venerable metropolis. Five times a year do\r\nmy eyes see it adorned with these fine ornaments. But it has never been\r\nso resplendent, and the damask breadths have never been so well tied or\r\nso close to the pillars as they are to-day."\r\n\r\n"So he is going to tell me his secret at last," said Julien. "Now he is\r\ngoing to talk about himself. He is expanding." But nothing imprudent\r\nwas said by the man in spite of his evident exaltation.\r\n\r\n"All the same he has worked a great deal," said Julien to himself.\r\n"He is happy. What a man! What an example for me! He really takes the\r\ncake." (This was a vulgar phrase which he had learned from the old\r\nsurgeon).\r\n\r\nAs the sanctus of high mass sounded, Julien wanted to take a surplice\r\nto follow the bishop in the superb procession. "And the thieves, my\r\nfriend! And the thieves," exclaimed the abb\xc3\xa9 Chas. "Have you forgotten\r\nthem? The procession will go out, but we will watch, will you and I.\r\nWe shall be very lucky if we get off with the loss of a couple of ells\r\nof this fine lace which surrounds the base of the pillars. It is a\r\ngift of Madame de Rubempr\xc3\xa9. It comes from her great-grandfather the\r\nfamous Count. It is made of real gold, my friend," added the abb\xc3\xa9 in\r\na whisper, and with evident exaltation. "And all genuine. I entrust\r\nyou with the watching of the north wing. Do not leave it. I will keep\r\nthe south wing and the great nave for myself. Keep an eye on the\r\nconfessional. It is there that the women accomplices of the thieves\r\nalways spy. Look out for the moment when we turn our backs."\r\n\r\nAs he finished speaking, a quarter to twelve struck. Immediately\r\nafterwards the sound of the great clock was heard. It rang a full peal.\r\nThese full solemn sounds affected Julien. His imagination was no longer\r\nturned to things earthly. The perfume of the incense and of the rose\r\nleaves thrown before the holy sacrament by little children disguised as\r\nSt. John increased his exaltation.\r\n\r\nLogically the grave sounds of the bell should only have recalled to\r\nJulien\'s mind the thought of the labour of twenty men paid fifty-four\r\ncentimes each, and possibly helped by fifteen or twenty faithful souls.\r\nLogically, he ought to have thought of the wear and tear of the cords\r\nand of the framework and of the danger of the clock itself, which\r\nfalls down every two centuries, and to have considered the means of\r\ndiminishing the salary of the bell-ringers, or of paying them by some\r\nindulgence or other grace dispensed from the treasures of the Church\r\nwithout diminishing its purse.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s soul exalted by these sounds with all their virile fulness,\r\ninstead of making these wise reflections, wandered in the realm\r\nof imagination. He will never turn out a good priest or a good\r\nadministrator. Souls which get thrilled so easily are at the best\r\nonly capable of producing an artist. At this moment the presumption\r\nof Julien bursts out into full view. Perhaps fifty of his comrades\r\nin the seminary made attentive to the realities of life by their own\r\nunpopularity and the Jacobinism which they are taught to see hiding\r\nbehind every hedge, would have had no other thought suggested by the\r\ngreat bell of the cathedral except the wages of the ringers. They would\r\nhave analysed with the genius of Bareme whether the intensity of the\r\nemotion produced among the public was worth the money which was given\r\nto the ringers. If Julien had only tried to think of the material\r\ninterests of the cathedral, his imagination would have transcended its\r\nactual object and thought of economizing forty francs on the fabric\r\nand have lost the opportunity of avoiding an expense of twenty-five\r\ncentimes.\r\n\r\nWhile the procession slowly traversed Besan\xc3\xa7on on the finest day\r\nimaginable, and stopped at the brilliant altar-stations put up by the\r\nauthorities, the church remained in profound silence. There prevailed a\r\nsemi-obscurity, an agreeable freshness. It was still perfumed with the\r\nfragrance of flowers and incense.\r\n\r\nThe silence, the deep solitude, the freshness of the long naves\r\nsweetened Julien\'s reverie. He did not fear being troubled by the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 Chas, who was engaged in another part of the building. His soul\r\nhad almost abandoned its mortal tenement, which was pacing slowly the\r\nnorth wing which had been trusted to his surveillance. He was all the\r\nmore tranquil when he had assured himself that there was no one in the\r\nconfessional except some devout women. His eyes looked in front of him\r\nseeing nothing.\r\n\r\nHis reverie was almost broken by the sight of two well-dressed women,\r\none in the Confessional, and the other on a chair quite near her. He\r\nlooked without seeing, but noticed, however, either by reason of some\r\nvague appreciation of his duties or admiration for the aristocratic\r\nbut simple dress of the ladies, that there was no priest in the\r\nConfessional.\r\n\r\n"It is singular," he thought, "that if these fair ladies are devout,\r\nthey are not kneeling before some altar, or that if they are in society\r\nthey have not an advantageous position in the first row of some\r\nbalcony. How well cut that dress is! How graceful!"\r\n\r\nHe slackened his pace to try and look at them. The lady who was\r\nkneeling in the Confessional turned her head a little hearing the noise\r\nof Julien\'s step in this solemn place. Suddenly she gave a loud cry,\r\nand felt ill.\r\n\r\nAs the lady collapsed and fell backwards on her knees, her friend who\r\nwas near her hastened to help her. At the same time Julien saw the\r\nshoulders of the lady who was falling backwards. His eyes were struck\r\nby a twisted necklace of fine, big pearls, which he knew well. What\r\nwere his emotions when he recognised the hair of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal? It\r\nwas she! The lady who was trying to prevent her from falling was Madame\r\nDerville. Julien was beside himself and hastened to their side. Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal\'s fall would perhaps have carried her friend along with her,\r\nif Julien had not supported them. He saw the head of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal,\r\npale and entirely devoid of consciousness floating on his shoulder. He\r\nhelped Madame Derville to lean that charming head up against a straw\r\nchair. He knelt down.\r\n\r\nMadame Derville turned round and recognised him.\r\n\r\n"Away, monsieur, away!" she said to him, in a tone of the most lively\r\nanger. "Above all, do not let her see you again. The sight of you would\r\nbe sure to horrify her. She was so happy before you came. Your conduct\r\nis atrocious. Flee! Take yourself off if you have any shame left."\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken with so much authority, and Julien felt so\r\nweak, that he did take himself off. "She always hated me," he said to\r\nhimself, thinking of Madame Derville. At the same moment the nasal\r\nchanting of the first priests in the procession which was now coming\r\nback resounded in the church. The abb\xc3\xa9 Chas-Bernard called Julien, who\r\nat first did not hear him, several times. He came at last and took his\r\narm behind a pillar where Julien had taken refuge more dead than alive.\r\nHe wanted to present him to the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"Are you feeling well, my child?" said the abb\xc3\xa9 to him, seeing him so\r\npale, and almost incapable of walking. "You have worked too much." The\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 gave him his arm. "Come, sit down behind me here, on the little\r\nseat of the dispenser of holy water; I will hide you."\r\n\r\nThey were now beside the main door.\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself. We have still a good twenty minutes before Monseigneur\r\nappears. Try and pull yourself together. I will lift you up when he\r\npasses, for in spite of my age, I am strong and vigorous."\r\n\r\nJulien was trembling so violently when the Bishop passed, that the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nChas gave up the idea of presenting him.\r\n\r\n"Do not take it too much to heart," he said. "I will find another\r\nopportunity."\r\n\r\nThe same evening he had six pounds of candles which had been saved, he\r\nsaid, by Julien\'s carefulness, and by the promptness with which he had\r\nextinguished them, carried to the seminary chapel. Nothing could have\r\nbeen nearer the truth. The poor boy was extinguished himself. He had\r\nnot had a single thought after meeting Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PROMOTION\r\n\r\n\r\n    He knew his age, he knew his department, and he is rich.\r\n                                               _The Forerunner_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien had not emerged from the deep reverie in which the episode in\r\nthe cathedral had plunged him, when the severe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard summoned him.\r\n\r\n"M. the abb\xc3\xa9 Chas-Bernard has just written in your favour. I am on\r\nthe whole sufficiently satisfied with your conduct. You are extremely\r\nimprudent and irresponsible without outward signs of it. However, up\r\nto the present, you have proved yourself possessed of a good and even\r\ngenerous heart. Your intellect is superior. Taking it all round, I see\r\nin you a spark which one must not neglect.\r\n\r\n"I am on the point of leaving this house after fifteen years of work.\r\nMy crime is that I have left the seminarists to their free will, and\r\nthat I have neither protected nor served that secret society of which\r\nyou spoke to me at the Confessional. I wish to do something for you\r\nbefore I leave. I would have done so two months earlier, for you\r\ndeserve it, had it not been for the information laid against you as\r\nthe result of the finding in your trunk of Amanda Binet\'s address. I\r\nwill make you New and Old Testament tutor. Julien was transported with\r\ngratitude and evolved the idea of throwing himself on his knees and\r\nthanking God. He yielded to a truer impulse, and approaching the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nPirard, took his hand and pressed it to his lips.\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of this?" exclaimed the director angrily, but\r\nJulien\'s eyes said even more than his act.\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard looked at him in astonishment, after the manner of a\r\nman who has long lost the habit of encountering refined emotions. The\r\nattention deceived the director. His voice altered.\r\n\r\n"Well yes, my child, I am attached to you. Heaven knows that I have\r\nbeen so in spite of myself. I ought to show neither hate nor love to\r\nanyone. I see in you something which offends the vulgar. Jealousy and\r\ncalumny will pursue you in whatever place Providence may place you.\r\nYour comrades will never behold you without hate, and if they pretend\r\nto like you, it will only be to betray you with greater certainty. For\r\nthis there is only one remedy. Seek help only from God, who, to punish\r\nyou for your presumption, has cursed you with the inevitable hatred\r\nof your comrades. Let your conduct be pure. That is the only resource\r\nwhich I can see for you. If you love truth with an irresistible\r\nembrace, your enemies will sooner or later be confounded."\r\n\r\nIt had been so long since Julien had heard a friendly voice that he\r\nmust be forgiven a weakness. He burst out into tears.\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard held out his arms to him. This moment was very sweet\r\nto both of them. Julien was mad with joy. This promotion was the first\r\nwhich he had obtained. The advantages were immense. To realise them one\r\nmust have been condemned to pass months on end without an instant\'s\r\nsolitude, and in immediate contact with comrades who were at the best\r\nimportunate, and for the most part insupportable. Their cries alone\r\nwould have sufficed to disorganise a delicate constitution. The noise\r\nand joy of these peasants, well-fed and well-clothed as they were,\r\ncould only find a vent for itself, or believe in its own completeness\r\nwhen they were shouting with all the strength of their lungs.\r\n\r\nNow Julien dined alone, or nearly an hour later than the other\r\nseminarists. He had a key of the garden and could walk in it when no\r\none else was there.\r\n\r\nJulien was astonished to perceive that he was now hated less. He, on\r\nthe contrary, had been expecting that their hate would become twice as\r\nintense. That secret desire of his that he should not be spoken to,\r\nwhich had been only too manifest before, and had earned him so many\r\nenemies, was no longer looked upon as a sign of ridiculous haughtiness.\r\nIt became, in the eyes of the coarse beings who surrounded him, a just\r\nappreciation of his own dignity. The hatred of him sensibly diminished,\r\nabove all among the youngest of his comrades, who were now his pupils,\r\nand whom he treated with much politeness. Gradually he obtained his own\r\nfollowing. It became looked upon as bad form to call him Martin Luther.\r\n\r\nBut what is the good of enumerating his friends and his enemies? The\r\nwhole business is squalid, and all the more squalid in proportion to\r\nthe truth of the picture. And yet the clergy supply the only teachers\r\nof morals which the people have. What would happen to the people\r\nwithout them? Will the paper ever replace the cure?\r\n\r\nSince Julien\'s new dignity, the director of the seminary made a point\r\nof never speaking to him without witnesses. These tactics were prudent,\r\nboth for the master and for the pupil, but above all it was meant for\r\na test. The invariable principle of that severe Jansenist Pirard was\r\nthis--"if a man has merit in your eyes, put obstacles in the way of\r\nall he desires, and of everything which he undertakes. If the merit is\r\nreal, he will manage to overthrow or get round those obstacles."\r\n\r\nIt was the hunting season. It had occurred to Fouqu\xc3\xa9 to send a stag\r\nand a boar to the seminary as though they came from Julien\'s parents.\r\nThe dead animals were put down on the floor between the kitchen and\r\nthe refectory. It was there that they were seen by all the seminarists\r\non their way to dinner. They constituted a great attraction for their\r\ncuriosity. The boar, dead though it was, made the youngest ones feel\r\nfrightened. They touched its tusks. They talked of nothing else for a\r\nwhole week.\r\n\r\nThis gift, which raised Julien\'s family to the level of that class\r\nof society which deserves respect, struck a deadly blow at all\r\njealousy. He enjoyed a superiority, consecrated by fortune. Chazel,\r\nthe most distinguished of the seminarists, made advances to him, and\r\nalways reproached him for not having previously apprised them of his\r\nparents\' position and had thus involved them in treating money without\r\nsufficient respect. A conscription took place, from which Julien, in\r\nhis capacity as seminarist, was exempt. This circumstance affected him\r\nprofoundly. "So there is just passed for ever that moment which, twenty\r\nyears earlier, would have seen my heroic life begin. He was walking\r\nalone in the seminary garden. He heard the masons who were walling up\r\nthe cloister walls talking between themselves.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we must go. There\'s the new conscription. When _the other_ was\r\nalive it was good business. A mason could become an officer then, could\r\nbecome a general then. One has seen such things."\r\n\r\n"You go and see now. It\'s only the ragamuffins who leave for the army.\r\nAny one _who has anything_ stays in the country here."\r\n\r\n"The man who is born wretched stays wretched, and there you are."\r\n\r\n"I say, is it true what they say, that the other is dead?" put in the\r\nthird mason.\r\n\r\n"Oh well, it\'s the \'_big men_\' who say that, you see. The other one\r\nmade them afraid."\r\n\r\n"What a difference. How the fortification went ahead in his time. And\r\nto think of his being betrayed by his own marshals."\r\n\r\nThis conversation consoled Julien a little. As he went away, he\r\nrepeated with a sigh:\r\n\r\n"_Le seul roi dont le peuple a gard\xc3\xa9 la m\xc3\xa9moire._"\r\n\r\nThe time for the examination arrived. Julien answered brilliantly. He\r\nsaw that Chazel endeavoured to exhibit all his knowledge. On the first\r\nday the examiners, nominated by the famous Grand Vicar de Frilair, were\r\nvery irritated at always having to put first, or at any rate second,\r\non their list, that Julien Sorel, who had been designated to them as\r\nthe Benjamin of the Abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. There were bets in the seminary that\r\nJulien would come out first in the final list of the examination, a\r\nprivilege which carried with it the honour of dining with my Lord\r\nBishop. But at the end of a sitting, dealing with the fathers of the\r\nChurch, an adroit examiner, having first interrogated Julien on Saint\r\nJerome and his passion for Cicero, went on to speak about Horace,\r\nVirgil and other profane authors. Julien had learnt by heart a great\r\nnumber of passages from these authors without his comrades\' knowledge.\r\nSwept away by his successes, he forgot the place where he was, and\r\nrecited in paraphrase with spirit several odes of Horace at the\r\nrepeated request of the examiner. Having for twenty minutes given him\r\nenough rope to hang himself, the examiner changed his expression, and\r\nbitterly reproached him for the time he had wasted on these profane\r\nstudies, and the useless or criminal ideas which he had got into his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"I am a fool, sir. You are right," said Julien modestly, realising the\r\nadroit stratagem of which he was the victim.\r\n\r\nThis examiner\'s dodge was considered dirty, even at the seminary, but\r\nthis did not prevent the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair, that adroit individual who\r\nhad so cleverly organised the machinery of the Besan\xc3\xa7on congregation,\r\nand whose despatches to Paris put fear into the hearts of judges,\r\nprefect, and even the generals of the garrison, from placing with\r\nhis powerful hand the number 198 against Julien\'s name. He enjoyed\r\nsubjecting his enemy, Pirard the Jansenist, to this mortification.\r\n\r\nHis chief object for the last ten years had been to deprive him of the\r\nheadship of the seminary. The abb\xc3\xa9, who had himself followed the plan\r\nwhich he had indicated to Julien, was sincere, pious, devoted to his\r\nduties and devoid of intrigue, but heaven in its anger had given him\r\nthat bilious temperament which is by nature so deeply sensitive to\r\ninsults and to hate. None of the insults which were addressed to him\r\nwas wasted on his burning soul. He would have handed in his resignation\r\na hundred times over, but he believed that he was useful in the place\r\nwhere Providence had set him. "I prevent the progress of Jesuitism and\r\nIdolatry," he said to himself.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the examinations, it was perhaps nearly two months\r\nsince he had spoken to Julien, and nevertheless, he was ill for eight\r\ndays when, on receipt of the official letter announcing the result of\r\nthe competition, he saw the number 198 placed beside the name of that\r\npupil whom he regarded as the glory of his town. This stern character\r\nfound his only consolation in concentrating all his surveillance on\r\nJulien. He was delighted that he discovered in him neither anger, nor\r\nvindictiveness, nor discouragement.\r\n\r\nJulien felt a thrill some months afterwards when he received a letter.\r\nIt bore the Paris post-mark. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal is remembering her\r\npromises at last, he thought. A gentleman who signed himself Paul\r\nSorel, and who said that he was his relative, sent him a letter of\r\ncredit for five hundred francs. The writer went on to add that if\r\nJulien went on to study successfully the good Latin authors, a similar\r\nsum would be sent to him every year.\r\n\r\n"It is she. It is her kindness," said Julien to himself, feeling quite\r\novercome. "She wishes to console me. But why not a single word of\r\naffection?"\r\n\r\nHe was making a mistake in regard to this letter, for Madame de R\xc3\xaanal,\r\nunder the influence of her friend, Madame Derville, was abandoning\r\nherself absolutely to profound remorse. She would often think, in\r\nspite of herself, of that singular being, the meeting with whom had\r\nrevolutionized her life. But she carefully refrained from writing to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIf we were to talk the terminology of the seminary, we would be able\r\nto recognise a miracle in the sending of these five hundred francs and\r\nto say that heaven was making use of Monsieur de Frilair himself in\r\norder to give this gift to Julien. Twelve years previously the abb\xc3\xa9 de\r\nFrilair had arrived in Besan\xc3\xa7on with an extremely exiguous portmanteau,\r\nwhich, according to the story, contained all his fortune. He was now\r\none of the richest proprietors of the department. In the course of his\r\nprosperity, he had bought the one half of an estate, while the other\r\nhalf had been inherited by Monsieur de la Mole. Consequently there was\r\na great lawsuit between these two personages.\r\n\r\nM. le Marquis de la Mole felt that, in spite of his brilliant life at\r\nParis and the offices which he held at Court, it would be dangerous to\r\nfight at Besan\xc3\xa7on against the Grand Vicar, who was reputed to make and\r\nunmake prefects.\r\n\r\nInstead of soliciting a present of fifty thousand francs which could\r\nhave been smuggled into the budget under some name or other, and of\r\nthrowing up this miserable lawsuit with the abb\xc3\xa9 Frilair over a matter\r\nof fifty thousand francs, the marquis lost his temper. He thought\r\nhe was in the right, absolutely in the right. Moreover, if one is\r\npermitted to say so, who is the judge who has not got a son, or at any\r\nrate a cousin to push in the world?\r\n\r\nIn order to enlighten the blindest minds the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair took\r\nthe carriage of my Lord the Bishop eight days after the first decree\r\nwhich he obtained, and went himself to convey the cross of the Legion\r\nof Honour to his advocate. M. de la Mole, a little dumbfounded at\r\nthe demeanour of the other side, and appreciating also that his own\r\nadvocates were slackening their efforts, asked advice of the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nCh\xc3\xa9lan, who put him in communication with M. Pirard.\r\n\r\nAt the period of our story the relations between these two men had\r\nlasted for several years. The abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard imported into this affair\r\nhis characteristic passion. Being in constant touch with the Marquis\'s\r\nadvocates, he studied his case, and finding it just, he became quite\r\nopenly the solicitor of M. de la Mole against the all-powerful Grand\r\nVicar. The latter felt outraged by such insolence, and on the part of a\r\nlittle Jansenist into the bargain.\r\n\r\n"See what this Court nobility who pretend to be so powerful really\r\nare," would say the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair to his intimates. M. de la Mole has\r\nnot even sent a miserable cross to his agent at Besan\xc3\xa7on, and will let\r\nhim be tamely turned out. None the less, so they write me, this noble\r\npeer never lets a week go by without going to show off his blue ribbon\r\nin the drawing-room of the Keeper of Seal, whoever it may be.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the energy of the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, and although M. de la\r\nMole was always on the best of terms with the minister of justice, and\r\nabove all with his officials, the best that he could achieve after six\r\ncareful years was not to lose his lawsuit right out. Being as he was\r\nin ceaseless correspondence with the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard in connection with an\r\naffair in which they were both passionately interested, the Marquis\r\ncame to appreciate the abb\xc3\xa9\'s particular kind of intellect. Little by\r\nlittle, and in spite of the immense distance in their social positions,\r\ntheir correspondence assumed the tone of friendship. The abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard\r\ntold the Marquis that they wanted to heap insults upon him till he\r\nshould be forced to hand in his resignation. In his anger against what,\r\nin his opinion, was the infamous stratagem employed against Julien, he\r\nnarrated his history to the Marquis.\r\n\r\nAlthough extremely rich, this great lord was by no means miserly. He\r\nhad never been able to prevail on the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard to accept even the\r\nreimbursement of the postal expenses occasioned by the lawsuit. He\r\nseized the opportunity of sending five hundred francs to his favourite\r\npupil. M. de la Mole himself took the trouble of writing the covering\r\nletter. This gave the abb\xc3\xa9 food for thought. One day the latter\r\nreceived a little note which requested him to go immediately on an\r\nurgent matter to an inn on the outskirts of Besan\xc3\xa7on. He found there\r\nthe steward of M. de la Mole.\r\n\r\n"M. le Marquis has instructed me to bring you his carriage," said the\r\nman to him. "He hopes that after you have read this letter you will\r\nfind it convenient to leave for Paris in four or five days. I will\r\nemploy the time in the meanwhile in asking you to be good enough to\r\nshow me the estates of M. le Marquis in the Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9, so that I\r\ncan go over them."\r\n\r\nThe letter was short:--\r\n\r\n        "Rid yourself, my good sir, of all the chicanery of the\r\n        provinces and come and breathe the peaceful atmosphere\r\n        of Paris. I send you my carriage which has orders to\r\n        await your decision for four days. I will await you\r\n        myself at Paris until Tuesday. You only require to say\r\n        so, monsieur, to accept in your own name one of the best\r\n        livings in the environs of Paris. The richest of your\r\n        future parishioners has never seen you, but is more\r\n        devoted than you can possibly think: he is the Marquis\r\n        de la Mole."\r\n\r\nWithout having suspected it, the stern abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard loved this seminary,\r\npeopled as it was by his enemies, but to which for the past fifteen\r\nyears he had devoted all his thoughts. M. de la Mole\'s letter had\r\nthe effect on him of the visit of the surgeon come to perform a\r\ndifficult but necessary operation. His dismissal was certain. He made\r\nan appointment with the steward for three days later. For forty-eight\r\nhours he was in a fever of uncertainty. Finally he wrote to the M. de\r\nla Mole, and composed for my Lord the Bishop a letter, a masterpiece of\r\necclesiastical style, although it was a little long; it would have been\r\ndifficult to have found more unimpeachable phrases, and ones breathing\r\na more sincere respect. And nevertheless, this letter, intended as it\r\nwas to get M. de Frilair into trouble with his patron, gave utterance\r\nto all the serious matters of complaint, and even descended to the\r\nlittle squalid intrigues which, having been endured with resignation\r\nfor six years, were forcing the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard to leave the diocese.\r\n\r\nThey stole his firewood, they poisoned his dog, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nHaving finished this letter he had Julien called. Like all the other\r\nseminarists, he was sleeping at eight o\'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n"You know where the Bishop\'s Palace is," he said to him in good\r\nclassical Latin. "Take this letter to my Lord. I will not hide from\r\nyou that I am sending you into the midst of the wolves. Be all ears\r\nand eyes. Let there be no lies in your answers, but realise that the\r\nman questioning you will possibly experience a real joy in being able\r\nto hurt you. I am very pleased, my child, at being able to give you\r\nthis experience before I leave you, for I do not hide from you that the\r\nletter which you are bearing is my resignation."\r\n\r\nJulien stood motionless. He loved the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. It was in vain that\r\nprudence said to him,\r\n\r\n"After this honest man\'s departure the Sacr\xc3\xa9-C\xc5\x93ur party will disgrace\r\nme and perhaps expel me."\r\n\r\nHe could not think of himself. He was embarrassed by a phrase which he\r\nwas trying to turn in a polite way, but as a matter of fact he found\r\nhimself without the brains to do so.\r\n\r\n"Well, my friend, are you not going?"\r\n\r\n"Is it because they say, monsieur," answered Julian timidly, "that you\r\nhave put nothing on one side during your long administration. I have\r\nsix hundred francs."\r\n\r\nHis tears prevented him from continuing.\r\n\r\n"_That also will be noticed,_" said the ex-director of the seminary\r\ncoldly. "Go to the Palace. It is getting late."\r\n\r\nChance would so have it that on that evening, the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair\r\nwas on duty in the salon of the Palace. My lord was dining with the\r\nprefect, so it was to M. de Frilair himself that Julien, though he did\r\nnot know it, handed the letter.\r\n\r\nJulien was astonished to see this abb\xc3\xa9 boldly open the letter which was\r\naddressed to the Bishop. The face of the Grand Vicar soon expressed\r\nsurprise, tinged with a lively pleasure, and became twice as grave\r\nas before. Julien, struck with his good appearance, found time to\r\nscrutinise him while he was reading. This face would have possessed\r\nmore dignity had it not been for the extreme subtlety which appeared\r\nin some features, and would have gone to the fact of actually denoting\r\nfalseness if the possessor of this fine countenance had ceased\r\nto school it for a single minute. The very prominent nose formed\r\na perfectly straight line and unfortunately gave to an otherwise\r\ndistinguished profile, a curious resemblance to the physiognomy of\r\na fox. Otherwise this abb\xc3\xa9, who appeared so engrossed with Monsieur\r\nPirard\'s resignation, was dressed with an elegance which Julien had\r\nnever seen before in any priest and which pleased him exceedingly.\r\n\r\nIt was only later that Julien knew in what the special talent of the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair really consisted. He knew how to amuse his bishop,\r\nan amiable old man made for Paris life, and who looked upon Besan\xc3\xa7on\r\nas exile. This Bishop had very bad sight, and was passionately fond\r\nof fish. The abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair used to take the bones out of the fish\r\nwhich was served to my Lord. Julien looked silently at the abb\xc3\xa9 who\r\nwas rereading the resignation when the door suddenly opened with a\r\nnoise. A richly dressed lackey passed in rapidly. Julien had only\r\ntime to turn round towards the door. He perceived a little old man\r\nwearing a pectoral cross. He prostrated himself. The Bishop addressed a\r\nbenevolent smile to him and passed on. The handsome abb\xc3\xa9 followed him\r\nand Julien was left alone in the salon, and was able to admire at his\r\nleisure its pious magnificence.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Besan\xc3\xa7on, a man whose spirit had been tried but\r\nnot broken by the long miseries of the emigration, was more than\r\nseventy-five years old and concerned himself infinitely little with\r\nwhat might happen in ten years\' time.\r\n\r\n"Who is that clever-looking seminarist I think I saw as I passed?" said\r\nthe Bishop. "Oughtn\'t they to be in bed according to my regulations."\r\n\r\n"That one is very wide-awake I assure you, my Lord, and he brings\r\ngreat news. It is the resignation of the only Jansenist residing in\r\nyour diocese, that terrible abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard realises at last that we mean\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the Bishop with a laugh. "I challenge you to replace him\r\nwith any man of equal worth, and to show you how much I prize that man,\r\nI will invite him to dinner for to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThe Grand Vicar tried to slide in a few words concerning the choice of\r\na successor. The prelate, who was little disposed to talk business,\r\nsaid to him.\r\n\r\n"Before we install the other, let us get to know a little of the\r\ncircumstances under which the present one is going. Fetch me this\r\nseminarist. The truth is in the mouth of children."\r\n\r\nJulien was summoned. "I shall find myself between two inquisitors,"\r\nhe thought. He had never felt more courageous. At the moment when he\r\nentered, two valets, better dressed than M. Valenod himself, were\r\nundressing my lord. That prelate thought he ought to question Julien\r\non his studies before questioning him about M. Pirard. He talked a\r\nlittle theology, and was astonished. He soon came to the humanities,\r\nto Virgil, to Horace, to Cicero. "It was those names," thought Julien,\r\nthat earned me my number 198. I have nothing to lose. Let us try\r\nand shine. He succeeded. The prelate, who was an excellent humanist\r\nhimself, was delighted.\r\n\r\nAt the prefect\'s dinner, a young girl who was justly celebrated,\r\nhad recited the poem of the Madeleine. He was in the mood to talk\r\nliterature, and very quickly forgot the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard and his affairs\r\nto discuss with the seminarist whether Horace was rich or poor. The\r\nprelate quoted several odes, but sometimes his memory was sluggish,\r\nand then Julien would recite with modesty the whole ode: the fact\r\nwhich struck the bishop was that Julien never deviated from the\r\nconversational tone. He spoke his twenty or thirty Latin verses as\r\nthough he had been speaking of what was taking place in his own\r\nseminary. They talked for a long time of Virgil, or Cicero, and the\r\nprelate could not help complimenting the young seminarist. "You could\r\nnot have studied better."\r\n\r\n"My Lord," said Julien, "your seminary can offer you 197 much less\r\nunworthy of your high esteem."\r\n\r\n"How is that?" said the Prelate astonished by the number.\r\n\r\n"I can support by official proof just what I have had the honour of\r\nsaying before my lord. I obtained the number 198 at the seminary\'s\r\nannual examination by giving accurate answers to the very questions\r\nwhich are earning me at the present moment my lord\'s approbation.\r\n\r\n"Ah, it is the Benjamin of the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard," said the Bishop with a\r\nlaugh, as he looked at M. de Frilair. "We should have been prepared\r\nfor this. But it is fair fighting. Did you not have to be woken up, my\r\nfriend," he said, addressing himself to Julien. "To be sent here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my Lord. I have only been out of the seminary alone once in my\r\nlife to go and help M. the abb\xc3\xa9 Chas-Bernard decorate the cathedral on\r\nCorpus Christi day.\r\n\r\n"Optime," said the Bishop. "So, it is you who showed proof of so much\r\ncourage by placing the bouquets of feathers on the baldachin. They\r\nmake me shudder. They make me fear that they will cost some man his\r\nlife. You will go far, my friend, but I do not wish to cut short your\r\nbrilliant career by making you die of hunger."\r\n\r\nAnd by the order of the Bishop, biscuits and wine were brought in, to\r\nwhich Julien did honour, and the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair, who knew that his\r\nBishop liked to see people eat gaily and with a good appetite, even\r\ngreater honour.\r\n\r\nThe prelate, more and more satisfied with the end of his evening,\r\ntalked for a moment of ecclesiastical history. He saw that Julien did\r\nnot understand. The prelate passed on to the moral condition of the\r\nRoman Empire under the system of the Emperor Constantine. The end of\r\npaganism had been accompanied by that state of anxiety and of doubt\r\nwhich afflicts sad and jaded spirits in the nineteenth century. My Lord\r\nnoticed Julien\'s ignorance of almost the very name of Tacitus. To the\r\nastonishment of the prelate, Julien answered frankly that that author\r\nwas not to be found in the seminary library.\r\n\r\n"I am truly very glad," said the Bishop gaily, "You relieve me of an\r\nembarrassment. I have been trying for the last five minutes to find a\r\nway of thanking you for the charming evening which you have given me in\r\na way that I could certainly never have expected. I did not anticipate\r\nfinding a teacher in a pupil in my seminary. Although the gift is not\r\nunduly canonical, I want to give you a Tacitus." The prelate had eight\r\nvolumes in a superior binding fetched for him, and insisted on writing\r\nhimself on the title page of the first volume a Latin compliment to\r\nJulien Sorel. The Bishop plumed himself on his fine Latinity. He\r\nfinished by saying to him in a serious tone, which completely clashed\r\nwith the rest of the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Young man, if you are good, you will have one day the best living in\r\nmy diocese, and one not a hundred leagues from my episcopal palace, but\r\nyou must be good."\r\n\r\nLaden with his volumes, Julien left the palace in a state of great\r\nastonishment as midnight was striking.\r\n\r\nMy Lord had not said a word to him about the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. Julien was\r\nparticularly astonished by the Bishop\'s extreme politeness. He had had\r\nno conception of such an urbanity in form combined with so natural an\r\nair of dignity. Julien was especially struck by the contrast on seeing\r\nagain the gloomy abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, who was impatiently awaiting him.\r\n\r\n"Quid tibi dixerunt (What have they said to you)?" he cried out to him\r\nin a loud voice as soon as he saw him in the distance. "Speak French,\r\nand repeat my Lord\'s own words without either adding or subtracting\r\nanything," said the ex-Director of the seminary in his harsh tone,\r\nand with his particularly inelegant manners, as Julien got slightly\r\nconfused in translating into Latin the speeches of the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"What a strange present on the part of the Bishop to a young\r\nseminarist," he ventured to say as he turned over the leaves of the\r\nsuperb Tacitus, whose gilt edges seemed to horrify him.\r\n\r\nTwo o\'clock was already striking when he allowed his favourite pupil to\r\nretire to his room after an extremely detailed account.\r\n\r\n"Leave me the first volume of your Tacitus," he said to him. "Where\r\nis my Lord Bishop\'s compliment? This Latin line will serve as your\r\nlightning-conductor in this house after my departure."\r\n\r\nErit tibi, fili mi, successor meus tanquam leo querens quem devoret.\r\n(For my successor will be to you, my son, like a ravening lion seeking\r\nsomeone to devour).\r\n\r\nThe following morning Julien noticed a certain strangeness in\r\nthe manner in which his comrades spoke to him. It only made him\r\nmore reserved. "This," he thought, "is the result of M. Pirard\'s\r\nresignation. It is known over the whole house, and I pass for his\r\nfavourite. There ought logically to be an insult in their demeanour."\r\nBut he could not detect it. On the contrary, there was an absence of\r\nhate in the eyes of all those he met along the corridors. "What is the\r\nmeaning of this? It is doubtless a trap. Let us play a wary game."\r\n\r\nFinally the little seminarist said to him with a laugh,\r\n\r\n"Cornelii Taciti opera omnia (complete works of Tacitus)."\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words, they all congratulated Julien enviously, not\r\nonly on the magnificent present which he had received from my lord, but\r\nalso on the two hours\' conversation with which he had been honoured.\r\nThey knew even its minutest details. From that moment envy ceased\r\ncompletely. They courted him basely. The abb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de, who had\r\nmanifested towards him the most extreme insolence the very day before,\r\ncame and took his arm and invited him to breakfast.\r\n\r\nBy some fatality in Julien\'s character, while the insolence of these\r\ncoarse creatures had occasioned him great pain, their baseness afforded\r\nhim disgust, but no pleasure.\r\n\r\nTowards mid-day the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard took leave of his pupils, but not\r\nbefore addressing to them a severe admonition.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish for the honours of the world," he said to them. "For all\r\nthe social advantages, for the pleasure of commanding pleasures, of\r\nsetting the laws at defiance, and the pleasure of being insolent with\r\nimpunity to all? Or do you wish for your eternal salvation? The most\r\nbackward of you have only got to open your eyes to distinguish the true\r\nways."\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely left before the devotees of the _Sacr\xc3\xa9 C\xc5\x93ur de J\xc3\xa9sus_\r\nwent into the chapel to intone a Te Deum. Nobody in the seminary took\r\nthe ex-director\'s admonition seriously.\r\n\r\n"He shows a great deal of temper because he is losing his job," was\r\nwhat was said in every quarter.\r\n\r\nNot a single seminarist was simple enough to believe in the voluntary\r\nresignation of a position which put him into such close touch with the\r\nbig contractors.\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard went and established himself in the finest inn at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on, and making an excuse of business which he had not got,\r\ninsisted on passing a couple of days there. The Bishop had invited\r\nhim to dinner, and in order to chaff his Grand Vicar de Frilair,\r\nendeavoured to make him shine. They were at dessert when the\r\nextraordinary intelligence arrived from Paris that the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard had\r\nbeen appointed to the magnificent living of N. ---- four leagues from\r\nParis. The good prelate congratulated him upon it. He saw in the whole\r\naffair a piece of good play which put him in a good temper and gave him\r\nthe highest opinion of the abb\xc3\xa9\'s talents. He gave him a magnificent\r\nLatin certificate, and enjoined silence on the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair, who was\r\nventuring to remonstrate.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, my Lord conveyed his admiration to the Marquise de\r\nRubempr\xc3\xa9. This was great news for fine Besan\xc3\xa7on society. They abandoned\r\nthemselves to all kinds of conjectures over this extraordinary favour.\r\nThey already saw the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard a Bishop. The more subtle brains\r\nthought M. de la Mole was a minister, and indulged on this day in\r\nsmiles at the imperious airs that M. the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair adopted in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe following day the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard was almost mobbed in the streets,\r\nand the tradesmen came to their shop doors when he went to solicit an\r\ninterview with the judges who had had to try the Marquis\'s lawsuit. For\r\nthe first time in his life he was politely received by them. The stern\r\nJansenist, indignant as he was with all that he saw, worked long with\r\nthe advocates whom he had chosen for the Marquis de la Mole, and left\r\nfor Paris. He was weak enough to tell two or three college friends who\r\naccompanied him to the carriage whose armorial bearings they admired,\r\nthat after having administered the Seminary for fifteen years he was\r\nleaving Besan\xc3\xa7on with five hundred and twenty francs of savings. His\r\nfriends kissed him with tears in their eyes, and said to each other,\r\n\r\n"The good abb\xc3\xa9 could have spared himself that lie. It is really too\r\nridiculous."\r\n\r\nThe vulgar, blinded as they are by the love of money, were\r\nconstitutionally incapable of understanding that it was in his own\r\nsincerity that the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard had found the necessary strength to\r\nfight for six years against Marie Alacoque, the _Sacr\xc3\xa9 C\xc5\x93ur de J\xc3\xa9sus_,\r\nthe Jesuits and his Bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nAN AMBITIOUS MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is only one nobility, the title of duke; a marquis is\r\n    ridiculous; the word duke makes one turn round.\r\n                                       _Edinburgh Review_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de la Mole received the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard without any of those\r\naristocratic mannerisms whose very politeness is at the same time so\r\nimpertinent to one who understands them. It would have been a waste of\r\ntime, and the Marquis was sufficiently expeditious in big affairs to\r\nhave no time to lose.\r\n\r\nHe had been intriguing for six months to get both the king and people\r\nto accept a minister who, as a matter of gratitude, was to make him a\r\nDuke. The Marquis had been asking his Besan\xc3\xa7on advocate for years on\r\nend for a clear and precise summary of his Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9 lawsuits. How\r\ncould the celebrated advocate explain to him what he did not understand\r\nhimself? The little square of paper which the abb\xc3\xa9 handed him explained\r\nthe whole matter.\r\n\r\n"My dear abb\xc3\xa9," said the Marquis to him, having got through in less\r\nthan five minutes all polite formulae of personal questions. "My dear\r\nabb\xc3\xa9, in the midst of my pretended prosperity I lack the time to occupy\r\nmyself seriously with two little matters which are rather important,\r\nmy family and my affairs. I manage the fortune of my house on a large\r\nscale. I can carry it far. I manage my pleasures, and that is the first\r\nconsideration in my eyes," he added, as he saw a look of astonishment\r\nin the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard\'s eyes. Although a man of common sense, the abb\xc3\xa9 was\r\nsurprised to hear a man talk so frankly about his pleasures.\r\n\r\n"Work doubtless exists in Paris," continued the great lord, "but it is\r\nperched on the fifth story, and as soon as I take anyone up, he takes\r\nan apartment on the second floor, and his wife starts a day at home;\r\nthe result is no more work and no more efforts except either to be, or\r\nappear to be, a society man. That is the only thing they bother about,\r\nas soon as they have got their bread and butter.\r\n\r\n"For my lawsuits, yes, for every single one of them, I have, to put it\r\nplainly, advocates who quarrel to death. One died of consumption the\r\nday before yesterday. Taking my business all round, would you believe,\r\nmonsieur, that for three years I have given up all hope of finding a\r\nman who deigns, during the time he is acting as my clerk, to give a\r\nlittle serious thought to what he is doing. Besides, all this is only a\r\npreliminary.\r\n\r\n"I respect you and would venture to add that, although I only see you\r\nfor the first time to-day, I like you. Will you be my secretary at a\r\nsalary of eight hundred francs or even double. I shall still be the\r\ngainer by it, I swear to you, and I will manage to reserve that fine\r\nliving for you for the day when we shall no longer be able to agree."\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 refused, but the genuine embarrassment in which he saw the\r\nMarquis suggested an idea to him towards the end of the conversation.\r\n\r\n"I have left in the depths of my seminary a poor young man who, if I\r\nmistake not, will be harshly persecuted. If he were only a simple monk\r\nhe would be already _in pace_. So far this young man only knows Latin\r\nand the Holy Scriptures, but it is not impossible that he will one day\r\nexhibit great talent, either for preaching or the guiding of souls. I\r\ndo not know what he will do, but he has the sacred fire. He may go far.\r\nI thought of giving him to our Bishop, if we had ever had one who was a\r\nlittle of your way of considering men and things."\r\n\r\n"What is your young man\'s extraction?" said the Marquis.\r\n\r\n"He is said to be the son of a carpenter in our mountains. I rather\r\nbelieve he is the natural son of some rich man. I have seen him receive\r\nan anonymous or pseudonymous letter with a bill for five hundred\r\nfrancs."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is Julien Sorel," said the Marquis.\r\n\r\n"How do you know his name?" said the abb\xc3\xa9, in astonishment, reddening\r\nat his question.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'m not going to tell you," answered the Marquis.\r\n\r\n"Well," replied the abb\xc3\xa9, "you might try making him your secretary. He\r\nhas energy. He has a logical mind. In a word, it\'s worth trying."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said the Marquis. "But would he be the kind of man to allow\r\nhis palm to be greased by the Prefect of Police or any one else and\r\nthen spy on me? That is only my objection."\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the favourable assurances of the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, the Marquis\r\ntook a thousand franc note.\r\n\r\n"Send this journey money to Julien Sorel. Let him come to me."\r\n\r\n"One sees at once," said the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, "that you live in Paris.\r\nYou do not know the tyranny which weighs us poor provincials down,\r\nand particularly those priests who are not friendly to the Jesuits.\r\nThey will refuse to let Julien Sorel leave. They will manage to cloak\r\nthemselves in the most clever excuses. They will answer me that he is\r\nill, that his letters were lost in the post, etc., etc."\r\n\r\n"I will get a letter from the minister to the Bishop, one of these\r\ndays," answered the Marquis.\r\n\r\n"I was forgetting to warn you of one thing," said the abb\xc3\xa9. "This young\r\nman, though of low birth, has a high spirit. He will be of no use if\r\nyou madden his pride. You will make him stupid."\r\n\r\n"That pleases me," said the Marquis. "I will make him my son\'s comrade.\r\nWill that be enough for you?"\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards, Julien received a letter in an unknown writing,\r\nand bearing the Ch\xc3\xa9lon postmark. He found in it a draft on a Besan\xc3\xa7on\r\nmerchant, and instructions to present himself at Paris without delay.\r\nThe letter was signed in a fictitious name, but Julien had felt a\r\nthrill in opening it. A leaf of a tree had fallen down at his feet. It\r\nwas the agreed signal between himself and the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour\'s time, Julien was summoned to the Bishop\'s Palace,\r\nwhere he found himself welcomed with a quite paternal benevolence. My\r\nlord quoted Horace and at the same time complimented him very adroitly\r\non the exalted destiny which awaited him in Paris in such a way as\r\nto elicit an explanation by way of thanks. Julien was unable to say\r\nanything, simply because he did not know anything, and my Lord showed\r\nhim much consideration. One of the little priests in the bishopric\r\nwrote to the mayor, who hastened to bring in person a signed passport,\r\nwhere the name of the traveller had been left in blank.\r\n\r\nBefore midnight of the same evening, Julien was at Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s. His\r\nfriend\'s shrewd mind was more astonished than pleased with the future\r\nwhich seemed to await his friend.\r\n\r\n"You will finish up," said that Liberal voter, "with a place in the\r\nGovernment, which will compel you to take some step which will be\r\ncalumniated. It will only be by your own disgrace that I shall have\r\nnews of you. Remember that, even from the financial standpoint, it is\r\nbetter to earn a hundred louis in a good timber business, of which\r\none is his own master, than to receive four thousand francs from a\r\nGovernment, even though it were that of King Solomon."\r\n\r\nJulien saw nothing in this except the pettiness of spirit of a country\r\nbourgeois. At last he was going to make an appearance in the theatre of\r\ngreat events. Everything was over-shadowed in his eyes by the happiness\r\nof going to Paris, which he imagined to be populated by people of\r\nintellect, full of intrigues and full of hypocrisy, but as polite as\r\nthe Bishop of Besan\xc3\xa7on and the Bishop of Agde. He represented to his\r\nfriend that he was deprived of any free choice in the matter by the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 Pirard\'s letter.\'\r\n\r\nThe following day he arrived at Verri\xc3\xa8res about noon. He felt the\r\nhappiest of men for he counted on seeing Madame de R\xc3\xaanal again. He\r\nwent first to his protector the good abb\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan. He met with a severe\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n"Do you think you are under any obligation to me?" said M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan to\r\nhim, without answering his greeting. "You will take breakfast with me.\r\nDuring that time I will have a horse hired for you and you will leave\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res without seeing anyone."\r\n\r\n"Hearing is obeying," answered Julien with a demeanour smacking of\r\nthe seminary, and the only questions now discussed were theology and\r\nclassical Latin.\r\n\r\nHe mounted his horse, rode a league, and then perceiving a wood and\r\nnot seeing any one who could notice him enter, he plunged into it.\r\nAt sunset, he sent away the horse. Later, he entered the cottage of\r\na peasant, who consented to sell him a ladder and to follow him with\r\nit to the little wood which commands the _Cours de la Fid\xc3\xa9lit\xc3\xa9_ at\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\n"I have been following a poor mutineer of a conscript ... or a\r\nsmuggler," said the peasant as he took leave of him, "but what does\r\nit matter? My ladder has been well paid for, and I myself have done a\r\nthing or two in that line."\r\n\r\nThe night was very black. Towards one o\'clock in the morning, Julien,\r\nladen with his ladder, entered Verri\xc3\xa8res. He descended as soon as he\r\ncould into the bed of the stream, which is banked within two walls, and\r\ntraverses M. de R\xc3\xaanal\'s magnificent gardens at a depth of ten feet.\r\nJulien easily climbed up the ladder. "How will the watch dogs welcome\r\nme," he thought. "It all turns on that." The dogs barked and galloped\r\ntowards him, but he whistled softly and they came and caressed him.\r\nThen climbing from terrace to terrace he easily managed, although all\r\nthe grills were shut, to get as far as the window of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s\r\nbedroom which, on the garden side, was only eight or six feet above the\r\nground. There was a little heart shaped opening in the shutters which\r\nJulien knew well. To his great disappointment, this little opening was\r\nnot illuminated by the flare of a little night-light inside.\r\n\r\n"Good God," he said to himself. "This room is not occupied by Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal. Where can she be sleeping? The family must be at Verri\xc3\xa8res since\r\nI have found the dogs here, but I might meet M. de R\xc3\xaanal himself, or\r\neven a stranger in this room without a light, and then what a scandal!"\r\nThe most prudent course was to retreat, but this idea horrified Julien.\r\n\r\n"If it\'s a stranger, I will run away for all I\'m worth, and leave my\r\nladder behind me, but if it is she, what a welcome awaits me! I can\r\nwell imagine that she has fallen into a mood of penitence and the most\r\nexalted piety, but after all, she still has some remembrance of me,\r\nsince she has written to me." This bit of reasoning decided him.\r\n\r\nWith a beating heart, but resolved none the less to see her or perish\r\nin the attempt, he threw some little pebbles against the shutter.\r\nNo answer. He leaned his long ladder beside the window, and himself\r\nknocked on the shutter, at first softly, and then more strongly.\r\n"However dark it is, they may still shoot me," thought Julien. This\r\nidea made the mad adventure simply a question of bravery.\r\n\r\n"This room is not being slept in to-night," he thought, "or whatever\r\nperson might be there would have woken up by now. So far as it is\r\nconcerned, therefore, no further precautions are needed. I must only\r\ntry not to be heard by the persons sleeping in the other rooms."\r\n\r\nHe descended, placed his ladder against one of the shutters, climbed\r\nup again, and placing his hand through the heart-shaped opening, was\r\nfortunate enough to find pretty quickly the wire which is attached to\r\nthe hook which closed the shutter. He pulled this wire. It was with an\r\nineffable joy that he felt that the shutter was no longer held back,\r\nand yielded to his effort.\r\n\r\nI must open it bit by bit and let her recognise my voice. He opened the\r\nshutter enough to pass his head through it, while he repeated in a low\r\nvoice, "It\'s a friend."\r\n\r\nHe pricked up his ears and assured himself that nothing disturbed the\r\nprofound silence of the room, but there could be no doubt about it,\r\nthere was no light, even half-extinguished, on the mantelpiece. It was\r\na very bad sign.\r\n\r\n"Look out for the gun-shot," he reflected a little, then he ventured\r\nto knock against the window with his finger. No answer. He knocked\r\nharder. I must finish it one way or another, even if I have to break\r\nthe window. When he was knocking very hard, he thought he could catch\r\na glimpse through the darkness of something like a white shadow that\r\nwas crossing the room. At last there was no doubt about it. He saw a\r\nshadow which appeared to advance with extreme slowness. Suddenly he saw\r\na cheek placed against the pane to which his eye was glued.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered and went away a little, but the night was so black that\r\nhe could not, even at this distance, distinguish if it were Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal. He was frightened of her crying out at first in alarm. He heard\r\nthe dogs prowling and growling around the foot of the ladder. "It is\r\nI," he repeated fairly loudly. "A friend."\r\n\r\nNo answer. The white phantom had disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Deign to open to me. I must speak to you. I am too unhappy." And he\r\nknocked hard enough to break the pane.\r\n\r\nA crisp sound followed. The casement fastening of the window yielded.\r\nHe pushed the casement and leaped lightly into the room.\r\n\r\nThe white phantom flitted away from him. He took hold of its arms. It\r\nwas a woman. All his ideas of courage vanished. "If it is she, what is\r\nshe going to say?" What were his emotions when a little cry gave him to\r\nunderstand, that it was Madame de R\xc3\xaanal?\r\n\r\nHe clasped her in his arms. She trembled and scarcely had the strength\r\nto push him away.\r\n\r\n"Unhappy man. What are you doing?" Her agonised voice could scarcely\r\narticulate the words.\r\n\r\nJulien thought that her voice rang with the most genuine indignation.\r\n\r\n"I have come to see you after a cruel separation of more than fourteen\r\nmonths."\r\n\r\n"Go away, leave me at once. Oh, M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan, why did you prevent me\r\nwriting to him? I could then have foreseen this horror." She pushed\r\nhim away with a truly extraordinary strength. "Heaven has deigned to\r\nenlighten me," she repeated in a broken voice. "Go away! Flee!"\r\n\r\n"After fourteen months of unhappiness I shall certainly not leave you\r\nwithout a word. I want to know all you have done. Yes, I have loved\r\nyou enough to deserve this confidence. I want to know everything."\r\nThis authoritative tone dominated Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s heart in spite of\r\nherself. Julien, who was hugging her passionately and resisting her\r\nefforts to get loose, left off clasping her in his arms. This reassured\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal a little.\r\n\r\n"I will take away the ladder," he said, "to prevent it compromising\r\nus in case some servant should be awakened by the noise, and go on a\r\nround."\r\n\r\n"Oh leave me, leave me!" she cried with an admirable anger. "What\r\ndo men matter to me! It is God who sees the awful scene you are now\r\nmaking. You are abusing meanly the sentiments which I had for you but\r\nhave no longer. Do you hear, Monsieur Julien?"\r\n\r\nHe took away the ladder very slowly so as not to make a noise.\r\n\r\n"Is your husband in town, dear," he said to her not in order to defy\r\nher but as a sheer matter of habit.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk to me like that, I beg you, or I will call my husband. I\r\nfeel only too guilty in not having sent you away before. I pity you,"\r\nshe said to him, trying to wound his, as she well knew, irritable pride.\r\n\r\nThis refusal of all endearments, this abrupt way of breaking so tender\r\na tie which he thought still subsisted, carried the transports of\r\nJulien\'s love to the point of delirium.\r\n\r\n"What! is it possible you do not love me?" he said to her, with one of\r\nthose accents that come straight from the heart and impose a severe\r\nstrain on the cold equanimity of the listener.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. As for him, he wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nIn fact he had no longer the strength to speak.\r\n\r\n"So I am completely forgotten by the one being who ever loved me, what\r\nis the good of living on henceforth?" As soon as he had no longer to\r\nfear the danger of meeting a man all his courage had left him; his\r\nheart now contained no emotion except that of love.\r\n\r\nHe wept for a long time in silence.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand; she tried to take it away, and after a few almost\r\nconvulsive moments, surrendered it to him. It was extremely dark; they\r\nwere both sitting on Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s bed.\r\n\r\n"What a change from fourteen months ago," thought Julien, and his tears\r\nredoubled. "So absence is really bound to destroy all human sentiments."\r\n\r\n"Deign to tell me what has happened to you?" Julien said at last.\r\n\r\n"My follies," answered Madame de R\xc3\xaanal in a hard voice whose frigid\r\nintonation contained in it a certain element of reproach, "were no\r\ndoubt known in the town when you left, your conduct was so imprudent.\r\nSome time afterwards when I was in despair the venerable Ch\xc3\xa9lan came to\r\nsee me. He tried in vain for a long time to obtain a confession. One\r\nday he took me to that church at Dijon where I made my first communion.\r\nIn that place he ventured to speak himself----" Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nwas interrupted by her tears. "What a moment of shame. I confessed\r\neverything. The good man was gracious enough not to overwhelm me with\r\nthe weight of his indignation. He grieved with me. During that time I\r\nused to write letters to you every day which I never ventured to send.\r\nI hid them carefully and when I was more than usually unhappy I shut\r\nmyself up in my room and read over my letters."\r\n\r\n"At last M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan induced me to hand them over to him, some of them\r\nwritten a little more discreetly were sent to you, you never answered."\r\n\r\n"I never received any letters from you, I swear!"\r\n\r\n"Great heavens! Who can have intercepted them? Imagine my grief until\r\nthe day I saw you in the cathedral. I did not know if you were still\r\nalive."\r\n\r\n"God granted me the grace of understanding how much I was sinning\r\ntowards Him, towards my children, towards my husband," went on Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal. "He never loved me in the way that I then thought that you\r\nhad loved me."\r\n\r\nJulien rushed into her arms, as a matter of fact without any particular\r\npurpose and feeling quite beside himself. But Madame de R\xc3\xaanal repelled\r\nhim and continued fairly firmly.\r\n\r\n"My venerable friend, M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan, made me understand that in marrying I\r\nhad plighted all my affections, even those which I did not then know,\r\nand which I had never felt before a certain fatal attachment ... after\r\nthe great sacrifice of the letters that were so dear to me, my life has\r\nflowed on, if not happily, at any rate calmly. Do not disturb it. Be\r\na friend to me, my best friend." Julien covered her hand with kisses.\r\nShe perceived he was still crying. "Do not cry, you pain me so much.\r\nTell me, in your turn, what you have been doing," Julien was unable\r\nto speak. "I want to know the life you lead at the seminary," she\r\nrepeated. "And then you will go."\r\n\r\nWithout thinking about what he was saying Julien spoke of the\r\nnumberless intrigues and jealousies which he had first encountered, and\r\nthen of the great serenity of his life after he had been made a tutor.\r\n\r\n"It was then," he added, "that after a long silence which was no doubt\r\nintended to make me realise what I see only too clearly to-day, that\r\nyou no longer loved me and that I had become a matter of indifference\r\nto you...."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal wrung her hands.\r\n\r\n"It was then that you sent me the sum of five hundred francs."\r\n\r\n"Never," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"It was a letter stamped Paris and signed Paul Sorel so as to avert\r\nsuspicion."\r\n\r\nThere was a little discussion about how the letter could possibly have\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nThe psychological situation was altered. Without knowing it Julien had\r\nabandoned his solemn tone; they were now once more on the footing of a\r\ntender affection. It was so dark that they did not see each other but\r\nthe tone of their voices was eloquent of everything. Julien clasped\r\nhis arm round his love\'s waist. This movement had its dangers. She\r\ntried to put Julien\'s arms away from her; at this juncture he cleverly\r\ndiverted her attention by an interesting detail in his story. The arm\r\nwas practically forgotten and remained in its present position.\r\n\r\nAfter many conjectures as to the origin of the five hundred francs\r\nletter, Julien took up his story. He regained a little of his\r\nself-control as he spoke of his past life, which compared with what he\r\nwas now experiencing interested him so little. His attention was now\r\nconcentrated on the final outcome of of his visit. "You will have to\r\ngo," were the curt words he heard from time to time.\r\n\r\n"What a disgrace for me if I am dismissed. My remorse will embitter all\r\nmy life," he said to himself, "she will never write to me. God knows\r\nwhen I shall come back to this part of the country." From this moment\r\nJulien\'s heart became rapidly oblivious of all the heavenly delights of\r\nhis present position.\r\n\r\nSeated as he was close to a woman whom he adored and practically\r\nclasping her in his arms in this room, the scene of his former\r\nhappiness, amid a deep obscurity, seeing quite clearly as he did that\r\nshe had just started crying, and feeling that she was sobbing from the\r\nheaving of her chest, he was unfortunate enough to turn into a cold\r\ndiplomatist, nearly as cold as in those days when in the courtyard\r\nof the seminary he found himself the butt of some malicious joke on\r\nthe part of one of his comrades who was stronger than he was. Julien\r\nprotracted his story by talking of his unhappy life since his departure\r\nfrom Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\n"So," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal to herself, "after a year\'s absence and\r\ndeprived almost entirely of all tokens of memory while I myself was\r\nforgetting him, he only thought of the happy days that he had had in\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res." Her sobs redoubled. Julien saw the success of his story.\r\nHe realised that he must play his last card. He abruptly mentioned a\r\nletter he had just received from Paris.\r\n\r\n"I have taken leave of my Lord Bishop."\r\n\r\n"What! you are not going back to Besan\xc3\xa7on? You are leaving us for ever?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Julien resolutely, "yes, I am leaving a country where I\r\nhave been forgotten even by the woman whom I loved more than anyone in\r\nmy life; I am leaving it and I shall never see it again. I am going to\r\nParis."\r\n\r\n"You are going to Paris, dear," exclaimed Madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nHer voice was almost choked by her tears and showed the extremity of\r\nher trouble. Julien had need of this encouragement. He was on the point\r\nof executing a man\xc5\x93uvre which might decide everything against him; and\r\nup to the time of this exclamation he could not tell what effect he was\r\nproducing as he was unable to see. He no longer hesitated. The fear of\r\nremorse gave him complete control over himself. He coldly added as he\r\ngot up.\r\n\r\n"Yes, madame, I leave you for ever. May you be happy. Adieu."\r\n\r\nHe moved some steps towards the window. He began to open it. Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal rushed to him and threw herself into his arms. So it was in this\r\nway that, after a dialogue lasting three hours, Julien obtained what he\r\ndesired so passionately during the first two hours.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s return to her tender feelings and this overshadowing\r\nof her remorse would have been a divine happiness had they come a\r\nlittle earlier; but, as they had been obtained by artifice, they were\r\nsimply a pleasure. Julien insisted on lighting the night-light in spite\r\nof his mistress\'s opposition.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish me then," he said to her "to have no recollection of\r\nhaving seen you. Is the love in those charming eyes to be lost to me\r\nfor ever? Is the whiteness of that pretty hand to remain invisible?\r\nRemember that perhaps I am leaving you for a very long time."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal could refuse him nothing. His argument made her melt\r\ninto tears. But the dawn was beginning to throw into sharp relief the\r\noutlines of the pine trees on the mountain east of Verri\xc3\xa8res. Instead\r\nof going away Julien, drunk with pleasure, asked Madame de R\xc3\xaanal to let\r\nhim pass the day in her room and leave the following night.\r\n\r\n"And why not?" she answered. "This fatal relapse robs me of all my\r\nrespect and will mar all my life," and she pressed him to her heart.\r\n"My husband is no longer the same; he has suspicions, he believes I led\r\nhim the way I wanted in all this business, and shows great irritation\r\nagainst me. If he hears the slightest noise I shall be ruined, he will\r\nhound me out like the unhappy woman that I am."\r\n\r\n"Ah here we have a phrase of M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan\'s," said Julien "you would not\r\nhave talked like that before my cruel departure to the seminary; in\r\nthose days you used to love me."\r\n\r\nJulien was rewarded for the frigidity which he put into those words. He\r\nsaw his love suddenly forget the danger which her husband\'s presence\r\ncompelled her to run, in thinking of the much greater danger of seeing\r\nJulien doubt her love. The daylight grew rapidly brighter and vividly\r\nilluminated the room. Julien savoured once more all the deliciousness\r\nof pride, when he saw this charming woman in his arms and almost at his\r\nfeet, the only woman whom he had ever loved, and who had been entirely\r\nabsorbed only a few hours before by her fear of a terrible God and her\r\ndevotion to her duties. Resolutions, fortified by a year\'s persuasion,\r\nhad failed to hold out against his courage.\r\n\r\nThey soon heard a noise in the house. A matter that Madame de R\xc3\xaanal had\r\nnot thought of began to trouble her.\r\n\r\n"That wicked Elisa will come into the room. What are we to do with this\r\nenormous ladder?" she said to her sweetheart, "where are we to hide it?\r\nI will take it to the loft," she exclaimed suddenly half playfully.\r\n\r\n"But you will have to pass through the servants\' room," said Julien in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n"I will leave the ladder in the corridor and will call the servant and\r\nsend him on an errand."\r\n\r\n"Think of some explanation to have ready in the event of a servant\r\npassing the ladder and noticing it in the corridor."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my angel," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal giving him a kiss "as for you,\r\ndear, remember to hide under the bed pretty quickly if Elisa enters\r\nhere during my absence."\r\n\r\nJulien was astonished by this sudden gaiety--"So" he thought, "the\r\napproach of a real danger instead of troubling her gives her back\r\nher spirits before she forgets her remorse. Truly a superior woman.\r\nYes, that\'s a heart over which it is glorious to reign." Julien was\r\ntransported with delight.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal took the ladder, which was obviously too heavy for her.\r\nJulien went to her help. He was admiring that elegant figure which was\r\nso far from betokening any strength when she suddenly seized the ladder\r\nwithout assistance and took it up as if it had been a chair. She took\r\nit rapidly into the corridor of the third storey where she laid it\r\nalongside the wall. She called a servant, and in order to give him time\r\nto dress himself, went up into the dovecot.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, when she came back to the corridor, she found no\r\nsigns of the ladder. What had happened to it? If Julien had been out\r\nof the house she would not have minded the danger in the least. But\r\nsupposing her husband were to see the ladder just now, the incident\r\nmight be awful. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal ran all over the house.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal finally discovered the ladder under the roof where the\r\nservant had carried it and even hid it.\r\n\r\n"What does it matter what happens in twenty-four hours," she thought,\r\n"when Julien will be gone?"\r\n\r\nShe had a vague idea that she ought to take leave of life but what\r\nmattered her duty? He was restored to her after a separation which she\r\nhad thought eternal. She was seeing him again and the efforts he had\r\nmade to reach her showed the extent of his love.\r\n\r\n"What shall I say to my husband," she said to him. "If the servant\r\ntells him he found this ladder?" She was pensive for a moment. "They\r\nwill need twenty-four hours to discover the peasant who sold it\r\nto you." And she threw herself into Julien\'s arms and clasped him\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\n"Oh, if I could only die like this," she cried covering him with\r\nkisses. "But you mustn\'t die of starvation," she said with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Come, I will first hide you in Madame Derville\'s room which is always\r\nlocked." She went and watched at the other end of the corridor and\r\nJulien ran in. "Mind you don\'t try and open if any one knocks," she\r\nsaid as she locked him in. "Anyway it would only be a frolic of the\r\nchildren as they play together."\r\n\r\n"Get them to come into the garden under the window," said Julien, "so\r\nthat I may have the pleasure of seeing them. Make them speak."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," cried Madame de R\xc3\xaanal to him as she went away. She soon\r\nreturned with oranges, biscuits and a bottle of Malaga wine. She had\r\nnot been able to steal any bread.\r\n\r\n"What is your husband doing?" said Julien.\r\n\r\n"He is writing out the figures of the bargains he is going to make with\r\nthe peasants."\r\n\r\nBut eight o\'clock had struck and they were making a lot of noise in the\r\nhouse. If Madame de R\xc3\xaanal failed to put in an appearance, they would\r\nlook for her all over the house. She was obliged to leave him. Soon she\r\ncame back, in defiance of all prudence, bringing him a cup of coffee.\r\nShe was frightened lest he should die of starvation.\r\n\r\nShe managed after breakfast to bring the children under the window of\r\nMadame Derville\'s room. He thought they had grown a great deal, but\r\nthey had begun to look common, or else his ideas had changed. Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal spoke to them about Julien. The elder answered in an affectionate\r\ntone and regretted his old tutor, but he found that the younger\r\nchildren had almost forgotten him.\r\n\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal did not go out that morning; he was going up and downstairs\r\nincessantly engaged in bargaining with some peasants to whom he was\r\nselling potatoes.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal did not have an instant to give to her prisoner until\r\ndinner-time. When the bell had been rung and dinner had been served,\r\nit occurred to her to steal a plate of warm soup for him. As she\r\nnoiselessly approached the door of the room which he occupied, she\r\nfound herself face to face with the servant who had hid the ladder\r\nin the morning. At the time he too was going noiselessly along the\r\ncorridor, as though listening for something. The servant took himself\r\noff in some confusion.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal boldly entered Julien\'s room. The news of this\r\nencounter made him shudder.\r\n\r\n"You are frightened," she said to him, "but I would brave all the\r\ndangers in the world without flinching. There is only one thing I fear,\r\nand that is the moment when I shall be alone after you have left," and\r\nshe left him and ran downstairs.\r\n\r\n"Ah," thought Julien ecstatically, "remorse is the only danger which\r\nthis sublime soul is afraid of."\r\n\r\nAt last evening came. Monsieur de R\xc3\xaanal went to the Casino.\r\n\r\nHis wife had given out that she was suffering from an awful headache.\r\nShe went to her room, hastened to dismiss Elisa and quickly got up in\r\norder to let Julien out.\r\n\r\nHe was literally starving. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal went to the pantry to fetch\r\nsome bread. Julien heard a loud cry. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal came back and told\r\nhim that when she went to the dark pantry and got near the cupboard\r\nwhere they kept the bread, she had touched a woman\'s arm as she\r\nstretched out her hand. It was Elisa who had uttered the cry Julien had\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n"What was she doing there?"\r\n\r\n"Stealing some sweets or else spying on us," said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal with\r\ncomplete indifference, "but luckily I found a pie and a big loaf of\r\nbread."\r\n\r\n"But what have you got there?" said Julien pointing to the pockets of\r\nher apron.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal had forgotten that they had been filled with bread\r\nsince dinner.\r\n\r\nJulien clasped her in his arms with the most lively passion. She had\r\nnever seemed to him so beautiful. "I could not meet a woman of greater\r\ncharacter even at Paris," he said confusedly to himself. She combined\r\nall the clumsiness of a woman who was but little accustomed to paying\r\nattentions of this kind, with all the genuine courage of a person who\r\nis only afraid of dangers of quite a different sphere and quite a\r\ndifferent kind of awfulness.\r\n\r\nWhile Julien was enjoying his supper with a hearty appetite and his\r\nsweetheart was rallying him on the simplicity of the meal, the door of\r\nthe room was suddenly shaken violently. It was M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"Why have you shut yourself in?" he cried to her.\r\n\r\nJulien had only just time to slip under the sofa.\r\n\r\nOn any ordinary day Madame de R\xc3\xaanal would have been upset by this\r\nquestion which was put with true conjugal harshness; but she realised\r\nthat M. de R\xc3\xaanal had only to bend down a little to notice Julien, for\r\nM. de R\xc3\xaanal had flung himself into the chair opposite the sofa which\r\nJulien had been sitting in one moment before.\r\n\r\nHer headache served as an excuse for everything. While her husband on\r\nhis side went into a long-winded account of the billiards pool which he\r\nhad won at Casino, "yes, to be sure a nineteen franc pool," he added.\r\nShe noticed Julien\'s hat on a chair three paces in front of them.\r\nHer self-possession became twice as great, she began to undress, and\r\nrapidly passing one minute behind her husband threw her dress over the\r\nchair with the hat on it.\r\n\r\nAt last M. de R\xc3\xaanal left. She begged Julien to start over again his\r\naccount of his life at the Seminary. "I was not listening to you\r\nyesterday all the time you were speaking, I was only thinking of\r\nprevailing on myself to send you away."\r\n\r\nShe was the personification of indiscretion. They talked very loud and\r\nabout two o\'clock in the morning they were interrupted by a violent\r\nknock at the door. It was M. de R\xc3\xaanal again.\r\n\r\n"Open quickly, there are thieves in the house!" he said. "Saint Jean\r\nfound their ladder this morning."\r\n\r\n"This is the end of everything," cried Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, throwing\r\nherself into Julien\'s arms. "He will kill both of us, he doesn\'t\r\nbelieve there are any thieves. I will die in your arms, and be more\r\nhappy in my death than I ever was in my life." She made no attempt to\r\nanswer her husband who was beginning to lose his temper, but started\r\nkissing Julien passionately.\r\n\r\n"Save Stanislas\'s mother," he said to her with an imperious look. "I\r\nwill jump down into the courtyard through the lavatory window, and\r\nescape in the garden; the dogs have recognised me. Make my clothes into\r\na parcel and throw them into the garden as soon as you can. In the\r\nmeanwhile let him break the door down. But above all, no confession, I\r\nforbid you to confess, it is better that he should suspect rather than\r\nbe certain."\r\n\r\n"You will kill yourself as you jump!" was her only answer and her only\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nShe went with him to the lavatory window; she then took sufficient time\r\nto hide his clothes. She finally opened the door to her husband who was\r\nboiling with rage. He looked in the room and in the lavatory without\r\nsaying a word and disappeared. Julien\'s clothes were thrown down to\r\nhim; he seized them and ran rapidly towards the bottom of the garden in\r\nthe direction of the Doubs.\r\n\r\nAs he was running he heard a bullet whistle past him, and heard at the\r\nsame time the report of a gun.\r\n\r\n"It is not M. de R\xc3\xaanal," he thought, "he\'s far too bad a shot." The\r\ndogs ran silently at his side, the second shot apparently broke the paw\r\nof one dog, for he began to whine piteously. Julien jumped the wall of\r\nthe terrace, did fifty paces under cover, and began to fly in another\r\ndirection. He heard voices calling and had a distinct view of his enemy\r\nthe servant firing a gun; a farmer also began to shoot away from the\r\nother side of the garden. Julien had already reached the bank of the\r\nDoubs where he dressed himself.\r\n\r\nAn hour later he was a league from Verri\xc3\xa8res on the Geneva road. "If\r\nthey had suspicions," thought Julien, "they will look for me on the\r\nParis road."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE PLEASURES OF THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n     O rus quando ego te aspiciam?--_Horace_\r\n\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no doubt come to wait for the Paris mail, Monsieur," said the\r\nhost of an inn where he had stopped to breakfast.\r\n\r\n"To-day or to-morrow, it matters little," said Julien.\r\n\r\nThe mail arrived while he was still posing as indifferent. There were\r\ntwo free places.\r\n\r\n"Why! it\'s you my poor Falcoz," said the traveller who was coming from\r\nthe Geneva side to the one who was getting in at the same time as\r\nJulien.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were settled in the outskirts of Lyons," said Falcoz,\r\n"in a delicious valley near the Rh\xc3\xb4ne."\r\n\r\n"Nicely settled! I am running away."\r\n\r\n"What! you are running away? you Saint Giraud! Have you, who look so\r\nvirtuous, committed some crime?" said Falcoz with a smile.\r\n\r\n"On my faith it comes to the same thing. I am running away from the\r\nabominable life which one leads in the provinces. I like the freshness\r\nof the woods and the country tranquillity, as you know. You have often\r\naccused me of being romantic. I don\'t want to hear politics talked as\r\nlong as I live, and politics are hounding me out."\r\n\r\n"But what party do you belong to?"\r\n\r\n"To none and that\'s what ruins me. That\'s all there is to be said\r\nabout my political life--I like music and painting. A good book is\r\nan event for me. I am going to be forty-four. How much longer have I\r\ngot to live? Fifteen--twenty--thirty years at the outside. Well, I\r\nwant the ministers in thirty years\' time to be a little cleverer than\r\nthose of to-day but quite as honest. The history of England serves as\r\na mirror for our own future. There will always be a king who will try\r\nto increase his prerogative. The ambition of becoming a deputy, the\r\nfame of Mirabeau and the hundreds of thousand francs which he won for\r\nhimself will always prevent the rich people in the province from going\r\nto sleep: they will call that being Liberal and loving the people. The\r\ndesire of becoming a peer or a gentleman of the chamber will always win\r\nover the ultras. On the ship of state every one is anxious to take over\r\nthe steering because it is well paid. Will there be never a poor little\r\nplace for the simple passenger?"\r\n\r\n"Is it the last elections which are forcing you out of the province?"\r\n\r\n"My misfortune goes further back. Four years ago I was forty and\r\npossessed 500,000 francs. I am four years older to-day and probably\r\n50,000 francs to the bad, as I shall lose that sum on the sale of my\r\nchateau of Monfleury in a superb position near the Rh\xc3\xb4ne.\r\n\r\n"At Paris I was tired of that perpetual comedy which is rendered\r\nobligatory by what you call nineteenth-century civilisation. I thirsted\r\nfor good nature and simplicity. I bought an estate in the mountains\r\nnear the Rhine, there was no more beautiful place under the heavens.\r\n\r\n"The village clergyman and the gentry of the locality pay me court for\r\nsix months; I invite them to dinner; I have left Paris, I tell them, so\r\nas to avoid talking politics or hearing politics talked for the rest of\r\nmy life. As you know I do not subscribe to any paper, the less letters\r\nthe postman brought me the happier I was.\r\n\r\n"That did not suit the vicar\'s book. I was soon the victim of a\r\nthousand unreasonable requests, annoyances, etc. I wished to give two\r\nor three hundred francs a year to the poor, I was asked to give it\r\nto the Paris associations, that of Saint Joseph, that of the Virgin,\r\netc. I refused. I was then insulted in a hundred ways. I was foolish\r\nenough to be upset by it. I could not go out in the morning to enjoy\r\nthe beauty of our mountain without finding some annoyance which\r\ndistracted me from my reveries and recalled unpleasantly both men and\r\ntheir wickedness. On the Rogation processions, for instance whose\r\nchanting I enjoy (it is probably a Greek melody) they will not bless\r\nmy fields because, says the clergyman, they belong to an infidel. A\r\ncow dies belonging to a devout old peasant woman. She says the reason\r\nis the neighbourhood of a pond which belongs to my infidel self, a\r\nphilosopher coming from Paris, and eight days afterwards I find my\r\nfish in agonies poisoned by lime. Intrigue in all its forms envelops\r\nme. The justice of the peace, who is an honest man, but frightened of\r\nlosing his place, always decides against me. The peace of the country\r\nproved a hell for me. Once they saw that I was abandoned by the vicar,\r\nthe head of the village congregation, and that I was not supported by\r\nthe retired captain who was the head of the Liberals they all fell upon\r\nme, down to the mason whom I had supported for a year, down to the very\r\nwheel-wright who wanted to cheat me with impunity over the repairing of\r\nmy ploughs.\r\n\r\n"In order to find some support, and to win at any rate some of my law\r\nsuits I became a Liberal, but, as you say, those damned elections come\r\nalong. They asked me for my vote."\r\n\r\n"For an unknown man?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, for a man whom I knew only too well. I refused. It was\r\nterribly imprudent. From that moment I had the Liberals on my hands as\r\nwell, and my position became intolerable. I believe that if the vicar\r\nhad got it into his head to accuse me of assassinating my servant,\r\nthere would be twenty witnesses of the two parties who would swear that\r\nthey had seen me committing the crime."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say you want to live in the country without pandering\r\nto the passions of your neighbours, without even listening to their\r\ngossip. What a mistake!"\r\n\r\n"It is rectified at last. Monfleury is for sale. I will lose 50,000\r\nfrancs if necessary, but I am over-joyed I am leaving that hell of\r\nhypocrisy and annoyance. I am going to look for solitude and rustic\r\npeace in the only place where those things are to be found in France,\r\non a fourth storey looking on to the Champs-Elys\xc3\xa9es; and, moreover, I\r\nam actually deliberating if I shall not commence my political career by\r\ngiving consecrated bread to the parish in the Roule quarter."\r\n\r\n"All this would not have happened under Bonaparte," said Falcoz with\r\neyes shining with rage and sorrow.\r\n\r\n"Very good, but why didn\'t your Bonaparte manage to keep his position?\r\nEverything which I suffer to-day is his work."\r\n\r\nAt this point Julien\'s attention was redoubled. He had realised from\r\nthe first word that the Bonapartist Falcoz was the old boyhood friend\r\nof M. de R\xc3\xaanal, who had been repudiated by him in 1816, and that the\r\nphilosopher Saint-Giraud must be the brother of that chief of the\r\nprefecture of----who managed to get the houses of the municipality\r\nknocked down to him at a cheap price.\r\n\r\n"And all this is the work of your Bonaparte. An honest man, aged forty,\r\nand possessed of five hundred thousand francs however inoffensive he\r\nis, cannot settle in the provinces and find peace there; those priests\r\nand nobles of his will turn him out."\r\n\r\n"Oh don\'t talk evil of him," exclaimed Falcoz. "France was never so\r\nhigh in the esteem of the nations as during the thirteen years of his\r\nreign; then every single act was great."\r\n\r\n"Your emperor, devil take him," replied the man of forty-four, "was\r\nonly great on his battle fields and when he reorganised the finances\r\nabout 1802. What is the meaning of all his conduct since then? What\r\nwith his chamberlains, his pomp, and his receptions in the Tuileries,\r\nhe has simply provided a new edition of all the monarchical tomfoolery.\r\nIt was a revised edition and might possibly have lasted for a century\r\nor two. The nobles and the priests wish to go back to the old one, but\r\nthey did not have the iron hand necessary to impose it on the public."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s just how an old printer would talk."\r\n\r\n"Who has turned me out of my estate?" continued the printer, angrily.\r\n"The priests, whom Napoleon called back by his Concordat instead\r\nof treating them like the State treats doctors, barristers, and\r\nastronomers, simply seeing in them ordinary citizens, and not bothering\r\nabout the particular calling by which they are trying to earn their\r\nlivelihood. Should we be saddled with these insolent gentlemen today,\r\nif your Bonaparte had not created barons and counts? No, they were out\r\nof fashion. Next to the priests, it\'s the little country nobility who\r\nhave annoyed me the most, and compelled me to become a Liberal."\r\n\r\nThe conversation was endless. The theme will occupy France for another\r\nhalf-century. As Saint-Giraud kept always repeating that it was\r\nimpossible to live in the provinces, Julien timidly suggested the case\r\nof M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"Zounds, young man, you\'re a nice one," exclaimed Falcoz. "He turned\r\nspider so as not to be fly, and a terrible spider into the bargain.\r\nBut I see that he is beaten by that man Valenod. Do you know that\r\nscoundrel? He\'s the villain of the piece. What will your M. de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nsay if he sees himself turned out one of these fine days, and Valenod\r\nput in his place?"\r\n\r\n"He will be left to brood over his crimes," said Saint-Giraud. "Do\r\nyou know Verri\xc3\xa8res, young man? Well, Bonaparte, heaven confound him!\r\nBonaparte and his monarchical tomfoolery rendered possible the reign\r\nof the R\xc3\xaanals and the Ch\xc3\xa9lans, which brought about the reign of the\r\nValenods and the Maslons."\r\n\r\nThis conversation, with its gloomy politics, astonished Julien and\r\ndistracted him from his delicious reveries.\r\n\r\nHe appreciated but little the first sight of Paris as perceived in the\r\ndistance. The castles in the air he had built about his future had to\r\nstruggle with the still present memory of the twenty-four hours that\r\nhe had just passed in Verri\xc3\xa8res. He vowed that he would never abandon\r\nhis mistress\'s children, and that he would leave everything in order\r\nto protect them, if the impertinence of the priests brought about a\r\nrepublic and the persecution of the nobles.\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened on the night of his arrival in Verri\xc3\xa8res if,\r\nat the moment when he had leant his ladder against the casement of\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s bedroom he had found that room occupied by a stranger\r\nor by M. de R\xc3\xaanal?\r\n\r\nBut how delicious, too, had been those first two hours when his\r\nsweetheart had been sincerely anxious to send him away and he had\r\npleaded his cause, sitting down by her in the darkness! A soul like\r\nJulien\'s is haunted by such memories for a lifetime. The rest of the\r\ninterview was already becoming merged in the first period of their\r\nlove, fourteen months previous.\r\n\r\nJulien was awakened from his deep meditation by the stopping of the\r\ncoach. They had just entered the courtyard of the Post in the Rue\r\nRousseau. "I want to go to La Malmaison," he said to a cabriolet which\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n"At this time, Monsieur--what for?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that got to do with you? Get on."\r\n\r\nEvery real passion only thinks about itself. That is why, in my view,\r\npassions are ridiculous at Paris, where one\'s neighbour always insists\r\non one\'s considering him a great deal. I shall refrain from recounting\r\nJulien\'s ecstasy at La Malmaison. He wept. What! in spite of those\r\nwretched white walls, built this very year, which cut the path up into\r\nbits? Yes, monsieur, for Julien, as for posterity, there was nothing to\r\nchoose between Arcole, Saint Helena, and La Malmaison.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Julien hesitated a great deal before going to the\r\ntheatre. He had strange ideas about that place of perdition.\r\n\r\nA deep distrust prevented him from admiring actual Paris. He was only\r\naffected by the monuments left behind by his hero.\r\n\r\n"So here I am in the centre of intrigue and hypocrisy. Here reign the\r\nprotectors of the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair." On the evening of the third day\r\nhis curiosity got the better of his plan of seeing everything before\r\npresenting himself to the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. The abb\xc3\xa9 explained to him coldly\r\nthe kind of life which he was to expect at M. de la Mole\'s.\r\n\r\n"If you do not prove useful to him at the end of some months you will\r\ngo back to the seminary, but not in disgrace. You will live in the\r\nhouse of the marquis, who is one of the greatest seigneurs of France.\r\nYou will wear black, but like a man who is in mourning, and not like\r\nan ecclesiastic. I insist on your following your theological studies\r\nthree days a week in a seminary where I will introduce you. Every day\r\nat twelve o\'clock you will establish yourself in the marquis\'s library;\r\nhe counts on making use of you in drafting letters concerning his\r\nlawsuits and other matters. The marquis will scribble on the margin\r\nof each letter he gets the kind of answer which is required. I have\r\nassured him that at the end of three months you will be so competent to\r\ndraft the answers, that out of every dozen you hand to the marquis for\r\nsignature, he will be able to sign eight or nine. In the evening, at\r\neight o\'clock, you will tidy up his bureau, and at ten you will be free.\r\n\r\n"It may be," continued the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, "that some old lady or some\r\nsmooth-voiced man will hint at immense advantages, or will crudely\r\noffer you gold, to show him the letters which the marquis has received."\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur," exclaimed Julien, blushing.\r\n\r\n"It is singular," said the abb\xc3\xa9 with a bitter smile, "that poor as\r\nyou are, and after a year at a seminary, you still have any of this\r\nvirtuous indignation left. You must have been very blind."\r\n\r\n"Can it be that blood will tell," muttered the abb\xc3\xa9 in a whisper, as\r\nthough speaking to himself. "The singular thing is," he added, looking\r\nat Julien, "that the marquis knows you--I don\'t know how. He will give\r\nyou a salary of a hundred louis to commence with. He is a man who only\r\nacts by his whim. That is his weakness. He will quarrel with you about\r\nthe most childish matters. If he is satisfied, your wages may rise in\r\nconsequence up to eight thousand francs.\r\n\r\n"But you realise," went on the abb\xc3\xa9, sourly, "that he is not giving\r\nyou all this money simply on account of your personal charm. The thing\r\nis to prove yourself useful. If I were in your place I would talk very\r\nlittle, and I would never talk about what I know nothing about.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said the abb\xc3\xa9, "I have made some enquiries for you. I was\r\nforgetting M. de la Mole\'s family. He has two children--a daughter and\r\na son of nineteen, eminently elegant--the kind of madman who never\r\nknows to-day what he will do to-morrow. He has spirit and valour; he\r\nhas been through the Spanish war. The marquis hopes, I don\'t know why,\r\nthat you will become a friend of the young count Norbert. I told him\r\nthat you were a great classic, and possibly he reckons on your teaching\r\nhis son some ready-made phrases about Cicero and Virgil.\r\n\r\n"If I were you, I should never allow that handsome young man to make\r\nfun of me, and before I accepted his advances, which you will find\r\nperfectly polite but a little ironical, I would make him repeat them\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\n"I will not hide from you the fact that the young count de La Mole is\r\nbound to despise you at first, because you are nothing more than a\r\nlittle bourgeois. His grandfather belonged to the court, and had the\r\nhonour of having his head cut off in the Place de Gr\xc3\xa8ve on the 26th\r\nApril, 1574, on account of a political intrigue.\r\n\r\n"As for you, you are the son of a carpenter of Verri\xc3\xa8res, and what\r\nis more, in receipt of his father\'s wages. Ponder well over these\r\ndifferences, and look up the family history in Moreri. All the\r\nflatterers who dine at their house make from time to time what they\r\ncall delicate allusions to it.\r\n\r\n"Be careful of how you answer the pleasantries of M. the count de La\r\nMole, chief of a squadron of hussars, and a future peer of France, and\r\ndon\'t come and complain to me later on."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said Julien, blushing violently, "that I ought not\r\neven to answer a man who despises me."\r\n\r\n"You have no idea of his contempt. It will only manifest itself by\r\ninflated compliments. If you were a fool, you might be taken in by it.\r\nIf you want to make your fortune, you ought to let yourself be taken in\r\nby it."\r\n\r\n"Shall I be looked upon as ungrateful," said Julien, "if I return to my\r\nlittle cell Number 108 when I find that all this no longer suits me?"\r\n\r\n"All the toadies of the house will no doubt calumniate you," said the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9, "but I myself will come to the rescue. Adsum qui feci. I will say\r\nthat I am responsible for that resolution."\r\n\r\nJulien was overwhelmed by the bitter and almost vindictive tone which\r\nhe noticed in M. Pirard; that tone completely infected his last answer.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the abb\xc3\xa9 had a conscientious scruple about loving\r\nJulien, and it was with a kind of religious fear that he took so direct\r\na part in another\'s life.\r\n\r\n"You will also see," he added with the same bad grace, as though\r\naccomplishing a painful duty, "you also will see Madame the marquise\r\nde La Mole. She is a big blonde woman about forty, devout, perfectly\r\npolite, and even more insignificant. She is the daughter of the old\r\nDuke de Chaulnes so well known for his aristocratic prejudices. This\r\ngreat lady is a kind of synopsis in high relief of all the fundamental\r\ncharacteristics of women of her rank. She does not conceal for her own\r\npart that the possession of ancestors who went through the crusades\r\nis the sole advantage which she respects. Money only comes a long way\r\nafterwards. Does that astonish you? We are no longer in the provinces,\r\nmy friend.\r\n\r\n"You will see many great lords in her salon talk about our princes in\r\na tone of singular flippancy. As for Madame de la Mole, she lowers her\r\nvoice out of respect every time she mentions the name of a Prince, and\r\nabove all the name of a Princess. I would not advise you to say in her\r\nhearing that Philip II. or Henry VII. were monsters. They were kings, a\r\nfact which gives them indisputable rights to the respect of creatures\r\nwithout birth like you and me. Nevertheless," added M. Pirard, "we are\r\npriests, for she will take you for one; that being our capacity, she\r\nconsiders us as spiritual valets necessary for her salvation."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said Julien, "I do not think I shall be long at Paris."\r\n\r\n"Good, but remember that no man of our class can make his fortune\r\nexcept through the great lords. With that indefinable element in your\r\ncharacter, at any rate I think it is, you will be persecuted if you\r\ndo not make your fortune. There is no middle course for you, make no\r\nmistake about it; people see that they do not give you pleasure when\r\nthey speak to you; in a social country like this you are condemned to\r\nunhappiness if you do not succeed in winning respect."\r\n\r\n"What would have become of you at Besan\xc3\xa7on without this whim of the\r\nmarquis de la Mole? One day you will realise the extraordinary extent\r\nof what he has done for you, and if you are not a monster you will be\r\neternally grateful to him and his family. How many poor abb\xc3\xa9s more\r\nlearned than you have lived years at Paris on the fifteen sous they\r\ngot for their mass and their ten sous they got for their dissertations\r\nin the Sorbonne. Remember what I told you last winter about the first\r\nyears of that bad man Cardinal Dubois. Are you proud enough by chance\r\nto think yourself more talented than he was?\r\n\r\n"Take, for instance, a quiet and average man like myself; I reckoned\r\non dying in my seminary. I was childish enough to get attached to\r\nit. Well I was on the point of being turned out, when I handed in\r\nmy resignation. You know what my fortune consisted of. I had five\r\nhundred and twenty francs capital neither more nor less, not a friend,\r\nscarcely two or three acquaintances. M. de la Mole, whom I had never\r\nseen, extricated me from that quandary. He only had to say the word\r\nand I was given a living where the parishioners are well-to-do people\r\nabove all crude vices, and where the income puts me to shame, it is so\r\ndisproportionate to my work. I refrained from talking to you all this\r\ntime simply to enable you to find your level a bit.\r\n\r\n"One word more, I have the misfortune to be irritable. It is possible\r\nthat you and I will cease to be on speaking terms.\r\n\r\n"If the airs of the marquise or the spiteful pleasantries of her son\r\nmake the house absolutely intolerable for you I advise you to finish\r\nyour studies in some seminary thirty leagues from Paris and rather\r\nnorth than south. There is more civilisation in the north, and, he\r\nadded lowering his voice, I must admit that the nearness of the Paris\r\npapers puts fear into our petty tyrants.\r\n\r\n"If we continue to find pleasure in each other\'s society and if the\r\nmarquis\'s house does not suit you, I will offer you the post of my\r\ncurate, and will go equal shares with you in what I get from the\r\nliving. I owe you that and even more, he added interrupting Julien\'s\r\nthanks, for the extraordinary offer which you made me at Besan\xc3\xa7on. If\r\ninstead of having five hundred and twenty francs I had had nothing you\r\nwould have saved me."\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9\'s voice had lost its tone of cruelty, Julien was ashamed to\r\nfeel tears in his eyes. He was desperately anxious to throw himself\r\ninto his friend\'s arms. He could not help saying to him in the most\r\nmanly manner he could assume:\r\n\r\n"I was hated by my father from the cradle; it was one of my great\r\nmisfortunes, but I shall no longer complain of my luck, I have found\r\nanother father in you, monsieur."\r\n\r\n"That is good, that is good," said the embarrassed abb\xc3\xa9, then suddenly\r\nremembering quite appropriately a seminary platitude "you must never\r\nsay luck, my child, always say providence."\r\n\r\nThe fiacre stopped. The coachman lifted up the bronze knocker of an\r\nimmense door. It was the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole, and to prevent the passers\r\nby having any doubt on the subject these words could be read in black\r\nmarble over the door.\r\n\r\nThis affectation displeased Julien. "They are so frightened of the\r\nJacobins. They see a Robespierre and his tumbril behind every head.\r\nTheir panic is often gloriously grotesque and they advertise their\r\nhouse like this so that in the event of a rising the rabble can\r\nrecognise it and loot it." He communicated his thought to the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nPirard.\r\n\r\n"Yes, poor child, you will soon be my curate. What a dreadful idea you\r\nhave got into your head."\r\n\r\n"Nothing could be simpler," said Julien.\r\n\r\nThe gravity of the porter, and above all, the cleanness of the the\r\ncourt, struck him with admiration. It was fine sunshine. "What\r\nmagnificent architecture," he said to his friend. The hotel in question\r\nwas one of those buildings of the Faubourg Saint-Germain with a flat\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade built about the time of Voltaire\'s death. At no other period had\r\nfashion and beauty been so far from one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nENTRY INTO SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\n        Ludicrous and pathetic memory: the first drawing-room\r\n        where one appeared alone and without support at the\r\n        age of eighteen! the look of a woman sufficed to\r\n        intimidate me. The more I wished to please the more\r\n        clumsy I became. I evolved the most unfounded ideas\r\n        about everything. I would either abandon myself without\r\n        any reason, or I would regard a man as an enemy simply\r\n        because he had looked at me with a serious air; but\r\n        all the same, in the middle of the unhappiness of\r\n        my timidity, how beautiful did I find a beautiful\r\n        day--_Kant_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien stopped in amazement in the middle of the courtyard. "Pull\r\nyourself together," said the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. "You get horrible ideas into\r\nyour head, besides you are only a child. What has happened to the\r\nnil mirari of Horace (no enthusiasm) remember that when they see you\r\nestablished here this crowd of lackeys will make fun of you. They will\r\nsee in you an equal who has been unjustly placed above them; and, under\r\na masquerade of good advice and a desire to help you, they will try to\r\nmake you fall into some gross blunder."\r\n\r\n"Let them do their worst," said Julien biting his lip, and he became as\r\ndistrustful as ever.\r\n\r\nThe salons on the first storey which our gentlemen went through before\r\nreaching the marquis\' study, would have seemed to you, my reader, as\r\ngloomy as they were magnificent. If they had been given to you just as\r\nthey were, you would have refused to live in them. This was the domain\r\nof yawning and melancholy reasoning. They redoubled Julien\'s rapture.\r\n"How can any one be unhappy?" he thought, "who lives in so splendid an\r\nabode."\r\n\r\nFinally our gentlemen arrived at the ugliest rooms in this superb\r\nsuite. There was scarcely any light. They found there a little keen\r\nman with a lively eye and a blonde wig. The abb\xc3\xa9 turned round\r\nto Julien and presented him. It was the marquis. Julien had much\r\ndifficulty in recognising him, he found his manner was so polite.\r\nIt was no longer the grand seigneur with that haughty manner of the\r\nabbey of Bray-le-Haut. Julien thought that his wig had much too many\r\nhairs. As the result of this opinion he was not at all intimidated.\r\nThe descendant of the friend of Henry III. seemed to him at first of\r\na rather insignificant appearance. He was extremely thin and very\r\nrestless, but he soon noticed that the marquis had a politeness which\r\nwas even more pleasant to his listener than that of the Bishop of\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on himself. The audience only lasted three minutes. As they went\r\nout the abb\xc3\xa9 said to Julien,\r\n\r\n"You looked at the marquis just as you would have looked at a picture.\r\nI am not a great expert in what these people here call politeness. You\r\nwill soon know more about it than I do, but really the boldness of your\r\nlooks seemed scarcely polite."\r\n\r\nThey had got back into the fiacre. The driver stopped near the\r\nboulevard; the abb\xc3\xa9 ushered Julien into a suite of large rooms. Julien\r\nnoticed that there was no furniture. He was looking at the magnificent\r\ngilded clock representing a subject which he thought very indecent,\r\nwhen a very elegant gentleman approached him with a smiling air. Julien\r\nbowed slightly.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman smiled and put his hand on his shoulder. Julien shuddered\r\nand leapt back, he reddened with rage. The abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, in spite of his\r\ngravity, laughed till the tears came into his eyes. The gentleman was a\r\ntailor.\r\n\r\n"I give you your liberty for two days," said the abb\xc3\xa9 as they went\r\nout. "You cannot be introduced before then to Madame de la Mole. Any\r\none else would watch over you as if you were a young girl during these\r\nfirst few moments of your life in this new Babylon. Get ruined at once\r\nif you have got to be ruined, and I will be rid of my own weakness of\r\nbeing fond of you. The day after to-morrow this tailor will bring you\r\ntwo suits, you will give the man who tries them on five francs. Apart\r\nfrom that don\'t let these Parisians hear the sound of your voice. If\r\nyou say a word they will manage somehow to make fun of you. They have a\r\ntalent for it. Come and see me the day after to-morrow at noon.... Go\r\nand ruin yourself.... I was forgetting, go and order boots and a hat at\r\nthese addresses."\r\n\r\nJulien scrutinised the handwriting of the addresses.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the marquis\'s hand," said the abb\xc3\xa9; "he is an energetic man who\r\nforesees everything, and prefers doing to ordering. He is taking you\r\ninto his house, so that you may spare him that kind of trouble. Will\r\nyou have enough brains to execute efficiently all the instructions\r\nwhich he will give you with scarcely a word of explanation? The future\r\nwill show, look after yourself."\r\n\r\nJulien entered the shops indicated by the addresses without saying a\r\nsingle word. He observed that he was received with respect, and that\r\nthe bootmaker as he wrote his name down in the ledger put M. de Sorel.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in the Cemetery of P\xc3\xa8re La Chaise a very obliging\r\ngentleman, and what is more, one who was Liberal in his views,\r\nsuggested that he should show Julien the tomb of Marshal Ney which a\r\nsagacious statecraft had deprived of the honour of an epitaph, but when\r\nhe left this Liberal, who with tears in his eyes almost clasped him in\r\nhis arms, Julien was without his watch. Enriched by this experience two\r\ndays afterwards he presented himself to the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, who looked at\r\nhim for a long time.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you are going to become a fop," said the abb\xc3\xa9 to him severely.\r\nJulien looked like a very young man in full mourning; as a matter of\r\nfact, he looked very well, but the good abb\xc3\xa9 was too provincial himself\r\nto see that Julien still carried his shoulders in that particular way\r\nwhich signifies in the provinces both elegance and importance. When the\r\nmarquis saw Julien his opinion of his graces differed so radically from\r\nthat of the good abb\xc3\xa9 as he said,\r\n\r\n"Would you have any objection to M. le Sorel taking some dancing\r\nlessons?"\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 was thunderstruck.\r\n\r\n"No," he answered at last. "Julien is not a priest."\r\n\r\nThe marquis went up the steps of a little secret staircase two at a\r\ntime, and installed our hero in a pretty attic which looked out on the\r\nbig garden of the hotel. He asked him how many shirts he had got at the\r\nlinen drapers.\r\n\r\n"Two," answered Julien, intimidated at seeing so great a lord\r\ncondescend to such details.\r\n\r\n"Very good," replied the marquis quite seriously, and with a certain\r\ncurt imperiousness which gave Julien food for thought. "Very good, get\r\ntwenty-two more shirts. Here are your first quarter\'s wages."\r\n\r\nAs he went down from the attic the marquis called an old man. "Ars\xc3\xa8ne,"\r\nhe said to him, "you will serve M. Sorel." A few minutes afterwards\r\nJulien found himself alone in a magnificent library. It was a delicious\r\nmoment. To prevent his emotion being discovered he went and hid in\r\na little dark corner. From there he contemplated with rapture the\r\nbrilliant backs of the books. "I shall be able to read all these," he\r\nsaid to himself. "How can I fail to like it here? M. de R\xc3\xaanal would\r\nhave thought himself dishonoured for ever by doing one-hundredth part\r\nof what the Marquis de la Mole has just done for me.\r\n\r\n"But let me have a look at the copies I have to make." Having finished\r\nthis work Julien ventured to approach the books. He almost went mad\r\nwith joy as he opened an edition of Voltaire. He ran and opened the\r\ndoor of the library to avoid being surprised. He then indulged in the\r\nluxury of opening each of the eighty volumes. They were magnificently\r\nbound and were the masterpiece of the best binder in London. It was\r\neven more than was required to raise Julien\'s admiration to the maximum.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards the marquis came in and was surprised to notice that\r\nJulien spelt cela with two "ll" cella. "Is all that the abb\xc3\xa9 told me of\r\nhis knowledge simply a fairy tale?" The marquis was greatly discouraged\r\nand gently said to him,\r\n\r\n"You are not sure of your spelling?"\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Julien without thinking in the least of the\r\ninjustice that he was doing to himself. He was overcome by the kindness\r\nof the marquis which recalled to him through sheer force of contrast\r\nthe superciliousness of M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"This trial of the little Franc-comtois abb\xc3\xa9 is waste of time," thought\r\nthe marquis, "but I had such great need of a reliable man."\r\n\r\n"You spell cela with one \'l,\'" said the marquis to him, "and when you\r\nhave finished your copies look the words whose spelling you are not\r\nsure of up in the dictionary."\r\n\r\nThe marquis sent for him at six o\'clock. He looked at Julien\'s boots\r\nwith manifest pain. "I am sorry for a mistake I made. I did not tell\r\nyou that you must dress every day at half-past five."\r\n\r\nJulien looked at him but did not understand.\r\n\r\n"I mean to say put on stockings. Ars\xc3\xa8ne will remind you. To-day I will\r\nmake your apologies."\r\n\r\nAs he finished the sentence M. de la Mole escorted Julien into a salon\r\nresplendent with gilding. On similar occasions M. de R\xc3\xaanal always made\r\na point of doubling his pace so as to have the privilege of being the\r\nfirst to pass the threshold. His former employer\'s petty vanity caused\r\nJulien to tread on the marquis\'s feet and hurt him a great deal because\r\nof his gout. "So he is clumsy to the bargain," he said to himself. He\r\npresented him to a woman of high stature and of imposing appearance.\r\nIt was the marquise. Julien thought that her manner was impertinent,\r\nand that she was a little like Madame de Maugiron, the wife of the\r\nsub-prefect of the arrondissement of Verri\xc3\xa8res when she was present\r\nat the Saint-Charles dinner. Rendered somewhat nervous by the extreme\r\nmagnificence of the salon Julien did not hear what M. de la Mole was\r\nsaying. The marquise scarcely deigned to look at him. There were\r\nseveral men there, among whom Julien recognised with an inexpressible\r\npleasure the young bishop of Agde who had deigned to speak to him some\r\nmonths before at the ceremony of Bray-le-Haut. This young prelate was\r\ndoubtless frightened by the tender look which the timidity of Julien\r\nfixed on him, and did not bother to recognise "the provincial."\r\n\r\nThe men assembled in this salon seemed to Julien to have a certain\r\nelement of gloom and constraint. Conversation takes place in a low\r\nvoice in Paris and little details are not exaggerated.\r\n\r\nA handsome young man with moustaches, came in about half-past six. He\r\nwas very pale, and had a very small head.\r\n\r\n"You always keep us waiting" said the marquise, as he kissed her hand.\r\n\r\nJulien realised that it was the Count de la Mole. From the very first\r\nhe thought he was charming.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible," he said to himself "that this is the man whose\r\noffensive jests are going to drive me out of the house."\r\n\r\nAs the result of scrutinising count Norbert, Julien noticed that he\r\nwas in boots and spurs. "And I have got to be in shoes just like\r\nan inferior apparently." They sat down at table, Julien heard the\r\nmarquise raising her voice a little and saying something severe. Almost\r\nsimultaneously he noticed an extremely blonde and very well developed\r\nyoung person who had just sat down opposite him. Nevertheless she\r\nmade no appeal to him. Looking at her attentively he thought that he\r\nhad never seen such beautiful eyes, although they betokened a great\r\ncoldness of soul. Subsequently Julien thought that, though they\r\nlooked bored and sceptical, they were conscious of the duty of being\r\nimpressive. "Madame de R\xc3\xaanal of course had very fine eyes" he said to\r\nhimself, "she used to be universally complimented on them, but they had\r\nnothing in common with these." Julien did not know enough of society\r\nto appreciate that it was the fire of repartee which from time to time\r\ngave their brilliancy to the eyes of Mademoiselle Mathilde (for that\r\nwas the name he heard her called by). When Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s eyes\r\nbecame animated, it was with the fire of passion, or as the result of a\r\ngenerous indignation on hearing of some evil deed. Towards the end of\r\nthe meal Julien found a word to express Mademoiselle de la Mole\'s type\r\nof beauty. Her eyes are scintillating, he said to himself. Apart from\r\nher eyes she was cruelly like her mother, whom he liked less and less,\r\nand he ceased looking at her. By way of compensation he thought Count\r\nNorbert admirable in every respect. Julien was so fascinated that the\r\nidea never occurred to him of being jealous, and hating him because he\r\nwas richer and of nobler birth than he was himself.\r\n\r\nJulien thought that the marquis looked bored.\r\n\r\nAbout the second course he said to his son: "Norbert, I ask all your\r\ngood offices for M. Julien Sorel, whom I have just taken into my staff\r\nand of whom I hope to make a man _si cella se peut_."\r\n\r\n"He is my secretary," said the marquis to his neighbour, "and he spells\r\ncela with two ll\'s." Everybody looked at Julien, who bowed to Norbert\r\nin a manner that was slightly too marked, but speaking generally they\r\nwere satisfied with his expression.\r\n\r\nThe marquis must have spoken about the kind of education which Julien\r\nhad received for one of the guests tackled him on Horace. "It was\r\njust by talking about Horace that I succeeded with the bishop of\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on," said Julien to himself. Apparently that is the only author\r\nthey know. From that instant he was master of himself. This transition\r\nwas rendered easy because he had just decided that he would never look\r\nupon Madamoiselle de la Mole as a woman after his own taste. Since the\r\nseminary he had the lowest opinion of men, and was not to be easily\r\nintimidated by them. He would have enjoyed all his self-possession if\r\nthe dining-room had been furnished with less magnificence. It was,\r\nas a matter of fact, two mirrors each eight feet high in which he\r\nwould look from time to time at the man who was speaking to him about\r\nHorace, which continued to impress him. His phrases were not too long\r\nfor a provincial, he had fine eyes whose brilliancy was doubled by his\r\nquavering timidity, or by his happy bashfulness when he had given a\r\ngood answer. They found him pleasant. This kind of examination gave\r\na little interest to a solemn dinner. The marquis signed to Julien\'s\r\nquestioner to press him sharply. "Can he possibly know something?" he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nJulien answered and thought out new ideas. He lost sufficient of his\r\nnervousness, not indeed to exhibit any wit, for that is impossible\r\nfor any one ignorant of the special language which is used in Paris,\r\nbut to show himself possessed of ideas which, though presented out of\r\nplace and ungracefully, were yet original. They saw that he knew Latin\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s adversary was a member of the Academy Inscriptions who chanced\r\nto know Latin. He found Julien a very good humanist, was not frightened\r\nof making him feel uncomfortable, and really tried to embarrass him. In\r\nthe heat of the controversy Julien eventually forgot the magnificent\r\nfurniture of the dining-room. He managed to expound theories concerning\r\nthe Latin poets which his questioner had never read of anywhere. Like\r\nan honest man, he gave the young secretary all due credit for them.\r\nAs luck would have it, they started a discussion on the question\r\nof whether Horace was poor or rich, a good humoured and careless\r\nvoluptuary who made verses to amuse himself, like Chapelle the friend\r\nof Moli\xc3\xa8re and de la Fontaine, or a poor devil of a poet laureate who\r\nwrote odes for the king\'s birthday like Southey, the accuser of Lord\r\nByron. They talked about the state of society under Augustus and under\r\nGeorge IV. At both periods the aristocracy was all-powerful, but,\r\nwhile at Rome it was despoiled of its power by Maecenas who was only a\r\nsimple knight, it had in England reduced George IV practically to the\r\nposition of a Venetian doge. This discussion seemed to lift the marquis\r\nout of that state of bored torpor in which he had been plunged at the\r\nbeginning of the dinner.\r\n\r\nJulien found meaningless such modern names as Southey, Lord Byron,\r\nand George IV, which he now heard pronounced for the first time. But\r\nevery one noticed that whenever the conversation dealt with events that\r\nhad taken place in Rome and about which knowledge could be obtained\r\nby a perusal of the works of Horace, Martial or Tacitus, etc., he\r\nshowed an indisputable superiority. Julien coolly appropriated several\r\nideas which he had learnt from the bishop of Besan\xc3\xa7on in the historic\r\nconversation which he had had with that prelate. These ideas were not\r\nthe least appreciated.\r\n\r\nWhen every one was tired of talking about poets the marquise, who\r\nalways made it a rule to admire whatever amused her husband, deigned\r\nto look at Julien. "Perhaps an educated man lies hid beneath the\r\nclumsy manners of this young abb\xc3\xa9," said the Academician who happened\r\nto be near the marquise. Julien caught a few words of what he said.\r\nReady-made phrases suited the intellect of the mistress of the house\r\nquite well. She adopted this one about Julien, and was very pleased\r\nwith herself for having invited the academician to dinner. "He has\r\namused M. de la Mole" she thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STEPS\r\n\r\n\r\n        This immense valley, filled with brilliant lights and so\r\n        many thousands of men dazzles my sight. No one knows me.\r\n        All are superior to me. I lose my head. _Poemi dell\' av.\r\n        REINA_.\r\n\r\nJulien was copying letters in the library very early the next day\r\nwhen Mademoiselle Mathilde came in by a little dummy door very well\r\nmasked by the backs of the books. While Julien was admiring the\r\ndevice, Mademoiselle Mathilde seemed astonished and somewhat annoyed\r\nat finding him there: Julien saw that she was in curl-papers and had\r\na hard, haughty, and masculine expression. Mademoiselle de la Mole\r\nhad the habit of surreptitiously stealing books from her father\'s\r\nlibrary. Julien\'s presence rendered this morning\'s journey abortive,\r\na fact which annoyed her all the more as she had come to fetch the\r\nsecond volume of Voltaire\'s _Princess of Babylon_, a worthy climax to\r\none of the most eminently monarchical and religious educations which\r\nthe convent of the Sacred Heart had ever provided. This poor girl of\r\nnineteen already required some element of spiciness in order to get up\r\nan interest in a novel.\r\n\r\nCount Norbert put in an appearance in the library about three o\'clock.\r\nHe had come to study a paper so as to be able to talk politics in the\r\nevening, and was very glad to meet Julien, whose existence he had\r\nforgotten. He was charming, and offered him a ride on horseback.\r\n\r\n"My father will excuse us until dinner."\r\n\r\nJulien appreciated the us and thought it charming.\r\n\r\n"Great heavens! M. le Comte," said Julien, "if it were a question of\r\nfelling an eighty-foot tree or hewing it out and making it into planks\r\nI would acquit myself all right, I daresay, but as for riding a horse,\r\nI haven\'t done such a thing six times in my life."\r\n\r\n"Well, this will be the seventh," said Norbert.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Julien remembered the king of ----\'s entry into\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res, and thought he rode extremely well. But as they were\r\nreturning from the Bois de Boulogne he fell right in the middle of the\r\nRue du Bac, as he suddenly tried to get out of the way of a cabriolet,\r\nand was spattered all over with mud. It was lucky that he had two\r\nsuits. The marquis, wishing to favour him with a few words at dinner,\r\nasked him for news of his excursion. Norbert began immediately to\r\nanswer him in general terms.\r\n\r\n"M. le Comte is extremely kind to me," answered Julien. "I thank him\r\nfor it, and I fully appreciate it. He was good enough to have the\r\nquietest and prettiest horse given to me, but after all he could\r\nnot tie me on to it, and owing to the lack of that precaution, I\r\nhad a fall right in the middle of that long street near the bridge.\r\nMadame Mathilde made a futile effort to hide a burst of laughter, and\r\nsubsequently was indiscreet enough to ask for details. Julien acquitted\r\nhimself with much simplicity. He had grace without knowing it.\r\n\r\n"I prophesy favourably about that little priest," said the marquis to\r\nthe academician. "Think of a provincial being simple over a matter like\r\nthat. Such a thing has never been witnessed before, and will never be\r\nwitnessed again; and what is more, he describes his misfortune before\r\nladies."\r\n\r\nJulien put his listeners so thoroughly at their ease over his\r\nmisfortune that at the end of the dinner, when the general conversation\r\nhad gone off on to another subject, Mademoiselle Mathilde asked her\r\nbrother some questions over the details of the unfortunate occurrence.\r\nAs she put numerous questions, and as Julien met her eyes several\r\ntimes, he ventured to answer himself, although the questions had not\r\nbeen addressed to him, and all three of them finished up by laughing\r\njust as though they had all been inhabitants of some village in the\r\ndepths of a forest.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Julien attended two theology lectures, and then\r\ncame back to copy out about twenty letters. He found a young man, who\r\nthough very carefully dressed, had a mean appearance and an envious\r\nexpression, established near him in the library.\r\n\r\nThe marquis entered, "What are you doing here, M. Tanbeau?" he said\r\nseverely to the new-comer.\r\n\r\n"I thought--" answered the young man, with a base smile.\r\n\r\n"No, monsieur, you thought nothing of the kind. This is a try-on, but\r\nit is an unfortunate one."\r\n\r\nYoung Tanbeau got up in a rage and disappeared. He was a nephew of the\r\nacademician who was a friend of Madame de la Mole, and intended to take\r\nup the profession of letters. The academician had induced the marquis\r\nto take him as a secretary. Tanbeau used to work in a separate room,\r\nbut having heard of the favour that was vouchsafed to Julien he wished\r\nto share it, and he had gone this morning and established his desk in\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock Julien ventured, after a little hesitation, to present\r\nhimself to Count Norbert. The latter was on the point of going riding,\r\nand being a man of perfect politeness felt embarrassed.\r\n\r\n"I think," he said to Julien, "that you had better go to the riding\r\nschool, and after a few weeks, I shall be charmed to ride with you."\r\n\r\n"I should like to have the honour of thanking you for the kindness\r\nwhich you have shewn me. Believe me, monsieur," added Julien very\r\nseriously, "that I appreciate all I owe you. If your horse has not been\r\nhurt by the reason of my clumsiness of yesterday, and if it is free I\r\nshould like to ride it this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Well, upon my word, my dear Sorel, you do so at your own risk and\r\nperil; kindly assume that I have put forth all the objections required\r\nby prudence. As a matter of fact it is four o\'clock, we have no time to\r\nlose."\r\n\r\nAs soon as Julien was on horseback, he said to the young count, "What\r\nmust one do not to fall off?"\r\n\r\n"Lots of things," answered Norbert, bursting into laughter. "Keep your\r\nbody back for instance."\r\n\r\nJulien put his horse to the trot. They were at the Place Louis XVI.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you foolhardy youngster," said Norbert "there are too many\r\ncarriages here, and they are driven by careless drivers into the\r\nbargain. Once you are on the ground their tilburies will run over your\r\nbody, they will not risk spoiling their horses\' mouths by pulling up\r\nshort."\r\n\r\nNorbert saw Julien twenty times on the point of tumbling, but in the\r\nend the excursion finished without misadventure. As they came back the\r\nyoung count said to his sister,\r\n\r\n"Allow me to introduce a dashing dare-devil."\r\n\r\nWhen he talked to his father over the dinner from one end of the table\r\nto the other, he did justice to Julien\'s courage. It was the only\r\nthing one could possibly praise about his style of riding. The young\r\ncount had heard in the morning the men who groomed the horses in the\r\ncourtyard making Julien\'s fall an opportunity for the most outrageous\r\njokes at his expense.\r\n\r\nIn spite of so much kindness Julien soon felt himself completely\r\nisolated in this family. All their customs seemed strange to him, and\r\nhe was cognizant of none of them. His blunders were the delight of the\r\nvalets.\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard had left for his living. "If Julien is a weak reed,\r\nlet him perish. If he is a man of spirit, let him get out of his\r\ndifficulties all alone," he thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE H\xc3\x94TEL DE LA MOLE\r\n\r\n\r\n        What is he doing here? Will he like it there? Will he\r\n        try to please?--_Ronsard_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf everything in the aristocratic salon of the Hotel de la Mole seemed\r\nstrange to Julien, that pale young man in his black suit seemed in his\r\nturn very strange to those persons who deigned to notice him. Madame de\r\nla Mole suggested to her husband that he should send him off on some\r\nbusiness on those days when they had certain persons to dinner.\r\n\r\n"I wish to carry the experiment to its logical conclusion," answered\r\nthe marquis. "The abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard contends that we are wrong in crushing\r\nthe self-respect of the people whom we allow around us. _One can only\r\nlean on what resists_. The only thing against this man is his unknown\r\nface, apart from that he is a deaf mute."\r\n\r\n"If I am to know my way about," said Julien to himself. "I must write\r\ndown the names of the persons whom I see come to the salon together\r\nwith a few words on their character."\r\n\r\nHe put at the head of the list five or six friends of the house who\r\ntook every opportunity of paying court to him, believing that he was\r\nprotected by a whim of the marquis. They were poor dull devils. But it\r\nmust be said in praise of this class of men, such as they are found\r\nto-day in the salons of the aristocracy, that every one did not find\r\nthem equally tame. One of them was now allowing himself to be bullied\r\nby the marquis, who was venting his irritation at a harsh remark which\r\nhad been addressed to him by the marquise.\r\n\r\nThe masters of the house were too proud or too prone to boredom; they\r\nwere too much used to finding their only distraction in the addressing\r\nof insults, to enable them to expect true friends. But, except on\r\nrainy days and in rare moments of savage boredom, they always showed\r\nthemselves perfectly polite.\r\n\r\nIf the five or six toadies who manifested so paternal an affection\r\ntowards Julien had deserted the Hotel de la Mole, the marquise would\r\nhave been exposed to long spells of solitude, and in the eyes of women\r\nof that class, solitude is awful, it is the symbol of _disgrace_.\r\n\r\nThe marquis was charming to his wife. He saw that her salon was\r\nsufficiently furnished, though not with peers, for he did not think his\r\nnew colleagues were sufficiently noble to come to his house as friends,\r\nor sufficiently amusing to be admitted as inferiors.\r\n\r\nIt was only later that Julien fathomed these secrets. The governing\r\npolicy of a household, though it forms the staple of conversation in\r\nbourgeois families, is only alluded to in families of the class of that\r\nof the marquis in moments of distress. So paramount even in this bored\r\ncentury is the necessity of amusing one\'s self, that even on the days\r\nof dinner-parties the marquis had scarcely left the salon before all\r\nthe guests ran away. Provided that one did not make any jests about\r\neither God or the priests or the king or the persons in office, or the\r\nartists who enjoyed the favour of the court, or of anything that was\r\nestablished, provided that one did not praise either B\xc3\xa9ranger or the\r\nopposition papers, or Voltaire or Rousseau or anything which involved\r\nany element of free speech, provided that above all that one never\r\ntalked politics, one could discuss everything with freedom.\r\n\r\nThere is no income of a hundred thousand crowns a year and no blue\r\nribbon which could sustain a contest against such a code of salon\r\netiquette.\r\n\r\nThe slightest live idea appeared a crudity. In spite of the prevailing\r\ngood form, perfect politeness, and desire to please, _ennui_ was\r\nvisible in every face. The young people who came to pay their calls\r\nwere frightened of speaking of anything which might make them suspected\r\nof thinking or of betraying that they had read something prohibited,\r\nand relapsed into silence after a few elegant phrases about Rossini and\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\nJulien noticed that the conversation was usually kept alive by two\r\nviscounts and five barons whom M. de la Mole had known at the time of\r\nthe emigration. These gentlemen enjoyed an income of from six to eight\r\nhundred thousand francs. Four swore by the _Quotidienne_ and three\r\nby the _Gazette de France_. One of them had every day some anecdote\r\nto tell about the Ch\xc3\xa2teau, in which he made lavish use of the word\r\n_admirable_. Julien noticed that he had five crosses, the others as a\r\nrule only had three.\r\n\r\nBy way of compensation six footmen in livery were to be seen in the\r\nante-room, and during the whole evening ices or tea were served every\r\nquarter-of-an-hour, while about midnight there was a kind of supper\r\nwith champagne.\r\n\r\nThis was the reason that sometimes induced Julien to stay till the\r\nend. Apart from this he could scarcely understand why any one could\r\nbring himself to take seriously the ordinary conversation in this\r\nmagnificently gilded salon. Sometimes he would look at the talkers to\r\nsee if they themselves were not making fun of what they were saying.\r\n"My M. de Maistre, whom I know by heart," he thought, "has put it a\r\nhundred times better, and all the same he is pretty boring."\r\n\r\nJulien was not the only one to appreciate this stifling moral\r\natmosphere. Some consoled themselves by taking a great quantity of\r\nices, others by the pleasure of saying all the rest of the evening, "I\r\nhave just come from the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole where I learnt that Russia,\r\netc."\r\n\r\nJulien learnt from one of the toadies that scarcely six months ago\r\nmadame de la Mole had rewarded more than twenty years of assiduous\r\nattention by promoting the poor baron Le Bourguignon, who had been a\r\nsub-prefect since the restoration, to the rank of prefect.\r\n\r\nThis great event had whetted the zeal of all these gentlemen.\r\nPreviously there were few things to which they would have objected,\r\nnow they objected to nothing. There was rarely any overt lack of\r\nconsideration, but Julien had already caught at meals two or three\r\nlittle short dialogues between the marquis and his wife which were\r\ncruel to those who were seated near them. These noble personages did\r\nnot conceal their sincere contempt for everyone who was not sprung\r\nfrom people who were entitled to ride in the carriages of the king.\r\nJulien noticed that the word crusade was the only word which gave their\r\nface an expression of deep seriousness akin to respect. Their ordinary\r\nrespect had always a touch of condescension. In the middle of this\r\nmagnificence and this boredom Julien was interested in nothing except\r\nM. de la Mole. He was delighted to hear him protest one day that he\r\nhad had nothing to do with the promotion of that poor Le Bourguignon,\r\nit was an attention to the marquise. Julien knew the truth from the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 Pirard.\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 was working in the marquis\'s library with Julien one morning\r\nat the eternal de Frilair lawsuit.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said Julien suddenly, "is dining every day with madame la\r\nmarquise one of my duties or a special favour that they show to me?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a special honour," replied the scandalised abb\xc3\xa9. "M. the\r\nAcademician, who has been cultivating the family for fifteen years, has\r\nnever been able to obtain so much for his M. Tanbeau."\r\n\r\n"I find it, sir, the most painful part of my employment. I was less\r\nbored at the seminary. Some times I see even mademoiselle de la Mole\r\nyawn, and yet she ought to be accustomed to the social charms of the\r\nfriends of the house. I am frightened of falling asleep. As a favour,\r\nobtain permission for me to go and get a forty sous\' dinner in some\r\nobscure inn."\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 who was a true snob, was very appreciative of the honour of\r\ndining with a great lord. While he was endeavouring to get Julien to\r\nunderstand this point of view a slight noise made them turn round.\r\nJulien saw mademoiselle de la Mole listening. He reddened. She had come\r\nto fetch a book and had heard everything. She began to entertain some\r\nrespect for Julien. "He has not been born servile," she thought, "like\r\nthat old abb\xc3\xa9. Heavens, how ugly he is."\r\n\r\nAt dinner Julien did not venture to look at mademoiselle de la Mole\r\nbut she was kind enough to speak to him. They were expecting a lot\r\nof visitors that day and she asked him to stay. The young girls of\r\nParis are not at all fond of persons of a certain age, especially when\r\nthey are slovenly. Julien did not need much penetration to realise\r\nthat the colleagues of M. le Bourguignon who remained in the salon\r\nhad the privilege of being the ordinary butt of mademoiselle de la\r\nMole\'s jokes. On this particular day, whether or not by reason of some\r\naffectation on her part, she proved cruel to bores.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole was the centre of a little knot which used to\r\nform nearly every evening behind the marquise\'s immense arm-chair.\r\nThere were to be found there the marquis de Croisenois, the comte\r\nde Caylus, the vicomte de Luz and two or three other young officers,\r\nthe friends of Norbert or his sister. These gentlemen used to sit\r\ndown on a large blue sofa. At the end of the sofa, opposite the part\r\nwhere the brilliant Mathilde was sitting, Julien sat in silence on a\r\nlittle, rather low straw chair. This modest position was envied by all\r\nthe toadies; Norbert kept his father\'s young secretary in countenance\r\nby speaking to him, or mentioning him by name once or twice in the\r\nevening. On this particular occasion mademoiselle de la Mole asked him\r\nwhat was the height of the mountain on which the citadel of Besan\xc3\xa7on\r\nis planted. Julien had never any idea if this mountain was higher or\r\nlower than Montmartre. He often laughed heartily at what was said in\r\nthis little knot, but he felt himself incapable of inventing anything\r\nanalagous. It was like a strange language which he understood but could\r\nnot speak.\r\n\r\nOn this particular day Matilde\'s friends manifested a continuous\r\nhostility to the visitors who came into the vast salon. The friends of\r\nthe house were the favoured victims at first, inasmuch as they were\r\nbetter known. You can form your opinion as to whether Julien paid\r\nattention; everything interested him, both the substance of things and\r\nthe manner of making fun of them.\r\n\r\n"And there is M. Descoulis," said Matilde; "he doesn\'t wear a wig any\r\nmore. Does he want to get a prefectship through sheer force of genius?\r\nHe is displaying that bald forehead which he says is filled with lofty\r\nthoughts."\r\n\r\n"He is a man who knows the whole world," said the marquis de\r\nCroisenois. "He also goes to my uncle the cardinal\'s. He is capable of\r\ncultivating a falsehood with each of his friends for years on end, and\r\nhe has two or three hundred friends. He knows how to nurse friendship,\r\nthat is his talent. He will go out, just as you see him, in the worst\r\nwinter weather, and be at the door of one of his friends by seven\r\no\'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n"He quarrels from time to time and he writes seven or eight letters\r\nfor each quarrel. Then he has a reconciliation and he writes seven or\r\neight letters to express his bursts of friendship. But he shines most\r\nbrilliantly in the frank and sincere expansiveness of the honest man\r\nwho keeps nothing up his sleeve. This man\xc5\x93uvre is brought into play\r\nwhen he has some favour to ask. One of my uncle\'s grand vicars is very\r\ngood at telling the life of M. Descoulis since the restoration. I will\r\nbring him to you."\r\n\r\n"Bah! I don\'t believe all that, it\'s professional jealousy among the\r\nlower classes," said the comte de Caylus.\r\n\r\n"M. Descoulis will live in history," replied the marquis. "He brought\r\nabout the restoration together with the abb\xc3\xa9 de Pradt and messieurs de\r\nTalleyrand and Pozzo di Borgo."\r\n\r\n"That man has handled millions," said Norbert, "and I can\'t conceive\r\nwhy he should come here to swallow my father\'s epigrams which are\r\nfrequently atrocious. \'How many times have you betrayed your friends,\r\nmy dear Descoulis?\' he shouted at him one day from one end of the table\r\nto the other."\r\n\r\n"But is it true that he has played the traitor?" asked mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole. "Who has not played the traitor?"\r\n\r\n"Why!" said the comte de Caylus to Norbert, "do you have that\r\ncelebrated Liberal, M. Sainclair, in your house. What the devil\'s he\r\ncome here for? I must go up to him and speak to him and make him speak.\r\nHe is said to be so clever."\r\n\r\n"But how will your mother receive him?" said M. de Croisenois. "He has\r\nsuch extravagant, generous and independent ideas."\r\n\r\n"Look," said mademoiselle de la Mole, "look at the independent man who\r\nbows down to the ground to M. Descoulis while he grabs hold of his\r\nhand. I almost thought he was going to put it to his lips."\r\n\r\n"Descoulis must stand better with the powers that be than we thought,"\r\nanswered M. de Croisenois.\r\n\r\n"Sainclair comes here in order to get into the academy," said Norbert.\r\n"See how he bows to the baron L----, Croisenois."\r\n\r\n"It would be less base to kneel down," replied M. de Luz.\r\n\r\n"My dear Sorel," said Norbert, "you are extremely smart, but you come\r\nfrom the mountains. Mind you never bow like that great poet is doing,\r\neven to God the Father."\r\n\r\n"Ah there\'s a really witty man, M. the Baron B\xc3\xa2ton," said mademoiselle\r\nde la Mole, imitating a little the voice of the flunkey who had just\r\nannounced him.\r\n\r\n"I think that even your servants make fun of him. What a name Baron\r\nB\xc3\xa2ton," said M. de Caylus.\r\n\r\n"What\'s in a name?" he said to us the other day, went on Matilde.\r\n"Imagine the Duke de Bouillon announced for the first time. So far as I\r\nam concerned the public only need to get used to me."\r\n\r\n"Julien left the vicinity of the sofa."\r\n\r\nStill insufficiently appreciative of the charming subtleties of a\r\ndelicate raillery to laugh at a joke, he considered that a jest ought\r\nto have some logical foundation. He saw nothing in these young peoples\'\r\nconversation except a vein of universal scandal-mongering and was\r\nshocked by it. His provincial or English prudery went so far as to\r\ndetect envy in it, though in this he was certainly mistaken.\r\n\r\n"Count Norbert," he said to himself, "who has had to make three drafts\r\nfor a twenty-line letter to his colonel would be only too glad to have\r\nwritten once in his whole life one page as good as M. Sainclair."\r\n\r\nJulien approached successively the several groups and attracted no\r\nattention by reason of his lack of importance. He followed the Baron\r\nB\xc3\xa2ton from a distance and tried to hear him.\r\n\r\nThis witty man appeared nervous and Julien did not see him recover\r\nhis equanimity before he had hit upon three or four stinging phrases.\r\nJulien thought that this kind of wit had great need of space.\r\n\r\nThe Baron could not make epigrams. He needed at least four sentences of\r\nsix lines each, in order to be brilliant.\r\n\r\n"That man argues, he does not talk," said someone behind Julien. He\r\nturned round and reddened with pleasure when he heard the name of the\r\ncomte Chalvet. He was the subtlest man of the century. Julien had often\r\nfound his name in the _Memorial of St. Helena_ and in the portions of\r\nhistory dictated by Napoleon. The diction of comte Chalvet was laconic,\r\nhis phrases were flashes of lightning--just, vivid, deep. If he talked\r\nabout any matter the conversation immediately made a step forward; he\r\nimported facts into it; it was a pleasure to hear him. In politics,\r\nhowever, he was a brazen cynic.\r\n\r\n"I am independent, I am," he was saying to a gentleman with three\r\nstars, of whom apparently he was making fun. "Why insist on my having\r\nto-day the same opinion I had six weeks ago. In that case my opinion\r\nwould be my master."\r\n\r\nFour grave young men who were standing round scowled; these gentlemen\r\ndid not like flippancy. The comte saw that he had gone too far. Luckily\r\nhe perceived the honest M. Balland, a veritable hypocrite of honesty.\r\nThe count began to talk to him; people closed up, for they realised\r\nthat poor Balland was going to be the next victim.\r\n\r\nM. Balland, although he was horribly ugly and his first steps in the\r\nworld were almost unmentionable, had by dint of his morals and his\r\nmorality married a very rich wife who had died; he subsequently married\r\na second very rich one who was never seen in society. He enjoyed, in\r\nall humility, an income of sixty thousand francs, and had his own\r\nflatterers. Comte Chalvet talked to him pitilessly about all this.\r\nThere was soon a circle of thirty persons around them. Everybody was\r\nsmiling, including the solemn young men who were the hope of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n"Why does he come to M. de la Mole where he is obviously only a\r\nlaughing stock?" thought Julien. He approached the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard to ask\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nM. Balland made his escape.\r\n\r\n"Good," said Norbert, "there is one of the spies of my father gone;\r\nthere is only the little limping Napier left."\r\n\r\n"Can that be the key of the riddle?" thought Julien, "but if so, why\r\ndoes the marquis receive M. Balland?"\r\n\r\nThe stern abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard was scowling in a corner of the salon listening\r\nto the lackeys announcing the names.\r\n\r\n"This is nothing more than a den," he was saying like another Basil, "I\r\nsee none but shady people come in."\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the severe abb\xc3\xa9 did not know what constitutes\r\nhigh society. But his friends the Jansenites, had given him some very\r\nprecise notions about those men who only get into society by reason\r\nof their extreme subtlety in the service of all parties, or of their\r\nmonstrous wealth. For some minutes that evening he answered Julien\'s\r\neager questions fully and freely, and then suddenly stopped short\r\ngrieved at having always to say ill of every one, and thinking he was\r\nguilty of a sin. Bilious Jansenist as he was, and believing as he did\r\nin the duty of Christian charity, his life was a perpetual conflict.\r\n\r\n"How strange that abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard looks," said mademoiselle de la Mole, as\r\nJulien came near the sofa.\r\n\r\nJulien felt irritated, but she was right all the same. M. Pirard was\r\nunquestionably the most honest man in the salon, but his pimply face,\r\nwhich was suffering from the stings of conscience, made him look\r\nhideous at this particular moment. "Trust physiognomy after this,"\r\nthought Julien, "it is only when the delicate conscience of the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nPirard is reproaching him for some trifling lapse that he looks so\r\nawful; while the expression of that notorious spy Napier shows a pure\r\nand tranquil happiness." The abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, however, had made great\r\nconcessions to his party. He had taken a servant, and was very well\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nJulien noticed something strange in the salon, it was that all eyes\r\nwere being turned towards the door, and there was a semi silence. The\r\nflunkey was announcing the famous Barron Tolly, who had just become\r\npublicly conspicuous by reason of the elections. Julien came forward\r\nand had a very good view of him. The baron had been the president of\r\nan electoral college; he had the brilliant idea of spiriting away\r\nthe little squares of paper which contained the votes of one of the\r\nparties. But to make up for it he replaced them by an equal number of\r\nother little pieces of paper containing a name agreeable to himself.\r\nThis drastic man\xc5\x93uvre had been noticed by some of the voters, who had\r\nmade an immediate point of congratulating the Baron de Tolly. The good\r\nfellow was still pale from this great business. Malicious persons had\r\npronounced the word galleys. M. de la Mole received him coldly. The\r\npoor Baron made his escape.\r\n\r\n"If he leaves us so quickly it\'s to go to M. Comte\'s,"[1] said Comte\r\nChalvet and everyone laughed.\r\n\r\nLittle Tanbeau was trying to win his spurs by talking to some silent\r\nnoblemen and some intriguers who, though shady, were all men of wit,\r\nand were on this particular night in great force in M. de la Mole\'s\r\nsalon (for he was mentioned for a place in the ministry). If he had not\r\nyet any subtlety of perception he made up for it as one will see by the\r\nenergy of his words.\r\n\r\n"Why not sentence that man to ten years\' imprisonment," he was saying\r\nat the moment when Julien approached his knot. "Those reptiles should\r\nbe confined in the bottom of a dungeon, they ought to languish to death\r\nin gaol, otherwise their venom will grow and become more dangerous.\r\nWhat is the good of sentencing him to a fine of a thousand crowns? He\r\nis poor, so be it, all the better, but his party will pay for him. What\r\nthe case required was a five hundred francs fine and ten years in a\r\ndungeon."\r\n\r\n"Well to be sure, who is the monster they are speaking about?" thought\r\nJulien who was viewing with amazement the vehement tone and hysterical\r\ngestures of his colleague. At this moment the thin, drawn, little face\r\nof the academician\'s nephew was hideous. Julien soon learnt that they\r\nwere talking of the greatest poet of the century.\r\n\r\n"You monster," Julien exclaimed half aloud, while tears of generosity\r\nmoistened his eyes. "You little rascal," he thought, "I will pay you\r\nout for this."\r\n\r\n"Yet," he thought, "those are the unborn hopes of the party of which\r\nthe marquis is one of the chiefs. How many crosses and how many\r\nsinecures would that celebrated man whom he is now defaming have\r\naccumulated if he had sold himself--I won\'t say to the mediocre\r\nministry of M. de Nerval--but to one of those reasonably honest\r\nministries which we have seen follow each other in succession."\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard motioned to Julien from some distance off; M. de la\r\nMole had just said something to him. But when Julien, who was listening\r\nat the moment with downcast eyes to the lamentations of the bishop,\r\nhad at length got free and was able to get near his friend, he found\r\nhim monopolised by the abominable little Tanbeau. The little beast\r\nhated him as the cause of Julien\'s favour with the marquis, and was now\r\nmaking up to him.\r\n\r\n"_When will death deliver us from that aged rottenness_," it was in\r\nthese words of a biblical energy that the little man of letters was\r\nnow talking of the venerable Lord Holland. His merit consisted in an\r\nexcellent knowledge of the biography of living men, and he had just\r\nmade a rapid review of all the men who could aspire to some influence\r\nunder the reign of the new King of England.\r\n\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard passed in to an adjacent salon. Julien followed him.\r\n\r\n"I warn you the marquis does not like scribblers, it is his only\r\nprejudice. Know Latin and Greek if you can manage it, the history of\r\nthe Egyptians, Persians, etc., he will honour and protect you as a\r\nlearned man. But don\'t write a page of French, especially on serious\r\nmatters which are above your position in society, or he will call you\r\na scribbler and take you for a scoundrel. How is it that living as you\r\ndo in the hotel of a great lord you don\'t know the Duke de Castries\'\r\nepigram on Alembert and Rousseau: \'the fellow wants to reason about\r\neverything and hasn\'t got an income of a thousand crowns\'!"\r\n\r\n"Everything leaks out here," thought Julien, "just like the seminary."\r\nHe had written eight or six fairly drastic pages. It was a kind of\r\nhistorical eulogy of the old surgeon-major who had, he said, made a man\r\nof him. "The little note book," said Julien to himself, "has always\r\nbeen locked." He went up to his room, burnt his manuscript and returned\r\nto the salon. The brilliant scoundrels had left it, only the men with\r\nthe stars were left.\r\n\r\nSeven or eight very aristocratic ladies, very devout, very affected,\r\nand of from thirty to thirty-five years of age, were grouped round\r\nthe table that the servants had just brought in ready served. The\r\nbrilliant mar\xc3\xa9chale de Fervaques came in apologising for the lateness\r\nof the hour. It was more than midnight: she went and sat down near\r\nthe marquise. Julien was deeply touched, she had the eyes and the\r\nexpression of madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole\'s circle was still full of people. She was\r\nengaged with her friends in making fun of the unfortunate comte de\r\nThaler. He was the only son of that celebrated Jew who was famous for\r\nthe riches that he had won by lending money to kings to make war on the\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nThe Jew had just died leaving his son an income of one hundred thousand\r\ncrowns a month, and a name that was only too well known. This strange\r\nposition required either a simple character or force of will power.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the comte was simply a fellow who was inflated by all\r\nkinds of pretensions which had been suggested to him by all his toadies.\r\n\r\nM. de Caylus asserted that they had induced him to make up his mind to\r\nask for the hand of mademoiselle de la Mole, to whom the marquis de\r\nCroisenois, who would be a duke with a hundred thousand francs a year,\r\nwas paying his attentions.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do not accuse him of having a mind," said Norbert pitifully.\r\n\r\nWill-power was what the poor comte de Thaler lacked most of all. So\r\nfar as this side of his character went he was worthy of being a king.\r\nHe would take council from everybody, but he never had the courage to\r\nfollow any advice to the bitter end.\r\n\r\n"His physiognomy would be sufficient in itself," mademoiselle de la\r\nMole was fond of saying, "to have inspired her with a holy joy." It\r\nwas a singular mixture of anxiety and disappointment, but from time to\r\ntime one could distinguish gusts of self-importance, and above all that\r\ntrenchant tone suited to the richest man in France, especially when he\r\nhad nothing to be ashamed of in his personal appearance and was not yet\r\nthirty-six. "He is timidly insolent," M. de Croisenois would say. The\r\ncomte de Caylus, Norbert, and two or three moustachioed young people\r\nmade fun of him to their heart\'s content without him suspecting it, and\r\nfinally packed him off as one o\'clock struck.\r\n\r\n"Are those your famous Arab horses waiting for you at the door in this\r\nawful weather?" said Norbert to him.\r\n\r\n"No, it is a new pair which are much cheaper," said M. de Thaler. "The\r\nhorse on the left cost me five thousand francs, while the one on the\r\nright is only worth one hundred louis, but I would ask you to believe\r\nme when I say that I only have him out at night. His trot you see is\r\nexactly like the other ones."\r\n\r\nNorbert\'s remark made the comte think it was good form for a man like\r\nhim to make a hobby of his horses, and that he must not let them get\r\nwet. He went away, and the other gentleman left a minute afterwards\r\nmaking fun of him all the time. "So," thought Julien as he heard them\r\nlaugh on the staircase, "I have the privilege of seeing the exact\r\nopposite of my own situation. I have not got twenty louis a year and I\r\nfound myself side by side with a man who has twenty louis an hour and\r\nthey made fun of him. Seeing a sight like that cures one of envy."\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] celebrated conjuror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nSENSIBILITY AND A GREAT PIOUS LADY\r\n\r\n\r\n        An idea which has any life in it seems like a crudity,\r\n        so accustomed are they to colourless expression. Woe to\r\n        him who introduces new ideas into his conversation!\r\n                                          --_Faublas_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the stage Julien had reached, when after several months of\r\nprobation the steward of the household handed him the third quarter of\r\nhis wages. M. de la Mole had entrusted him with the administration of\r\nhis estates in Brittany and Normandy. Julien made frequent journeys\r\nthere. He had chief control of the correspondence relating to the\r\nfamous lawsuit with the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair. M. Pirard had instructed him.\r\n\r\nOn the data of the short notes which the marquis would scribble on the\r\nmargin of all the various paper which were addressed to him, Julien\r\nwould compose answers which were nearly all signed.\r\n\r\nAt the Theology School his professors complained of his lack of\r\nindustry, but they did not fail to regard him as one of their most\r\ndistinguished pupils. This varied work, tackled as it was with all\r\nthe ardour of suffering ambition, soon robbed Julien of that fresh\r\ncomplexion which he had brought from the provinces. His pallor\r\nconstituted one of his merits in the eyes of his comrades, the young\r\nseminarist; he found them much less malicious, much less ready to bow\r\ndown to a silver crown than those of Besan\xc3\xa7on; they thought he was\r\nconsumptive. The marquis had given him a horse.\r\n\r\nJulien fearing that he might meet people during his rides on horseback,\r\nhad given out that this exercise had been prescribed by the doctors.\r\nThe abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard had taken him into several Jansenist Societies. Julien\r\nwas astonished; the idea of religion was indissolubly connected in his\r\nmind with the ideas of hypocrisy and covetousness. He admired those\r\naustere pious men who never gave a thought to their income. Several\r\nJansenists became friendly with him and would give him advice. A new\r\nworld opened before him. At the Jansenists he got to know a comte\r\nAltamira, who was nearly six feet high, was a Liberal, a believer, and\r\nhad been condemned to death in his own country. He was struck by the\r\nstrange contrast of devoutness and love of liberty.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s relations with the young comte had become cool. Norbert\r\nhad thought that he answered the jokes of his friends with too much\r\nsharpness. Julien had committed one or two breaches of social etiquette\r\nand vowed to himself that he would never speak to mademoiselle\r\nMathilde. They were always perfectly polite to him in the H\xc3\xb4tel de\r\nla Mole but he felt himself quite lost. His provincial common sense\r\nexplained this result by the vulgar proverb _Tout beau tout nouveau_.\r\n\r\nHe gradually came to have a little more penetration than during his\r\nfirst days, or it may have been that the first glamour of Parisian\r\nurbanity had passed off. As soon as he left off working, he fell a prey\r\nto a mortal boredom. He was experiencing the withering effects of that\r\nadmirable politeness so typical of good society, which is so perfectly\r\nmodulated to every degree of the social hierarchy.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the provinces can be reproached with a commonness and lack of\r\npolish in their tone; but they show a certain amount of passion, when\r\nthey answer you. Julien\'s self-respect was never wounded at the H\xc3\xb4tel\r\nde la Mole, but he often felt at the end of the day as though he would\r\nlike to cry. A caf\xc3\xa9-waiter in the provinces will take an interest in\r\nyou if you happen to have some accident as you enter his caf\xc3\xa9, but if\r\nthis accident has everything about it which is disagreeable to your\r\nvanity, he will repeat ten times in succession the very word which\r\ntortures you, as he tells you how sorry he is. At Paris they make a\r\npoint of laughing in secret, but you always remain a stranger.\r\n\r\nWe pass in silence over a number of little episodes which would have\r\nmade Julien ridiculous, if he had not been to some extent above\r\nridicule. A foolish sensibility resulted in his committing innumerable\r\nacts of bad taste. All his pleasures were precautions; he practiced\r\npistol shooting every day, he was one of the promising pupils of the\r\nmost famous ma\xc3\xaetres d\'armes. As soon as he had an instant to himself,\r\ninstead of employing it in reading as he did before, he would rush\r\noff to the riding school and ask for the most vicious horses. When he\r\nwent out with the master of the riding school he was almost invariably\r\nthrown.\r\n\r\nThe marquis found him convenient by reason of his persistent industry,\r\nhis silence and his intelligence, and gradually took him into his\r\nconfidence with regard to all his affairs, which were in any way\r\ndifficult to unravel. The marquis was a sagacious business man on all\r\nthose occasions when his lofty ambition gave him some respite; having\r\nspecial information within his reach, he would speculate successfully\r\non the Exchange. He would buy mansions and forests; but he would easily\r\nlose his temper. He would give away hundreds of louis, and would go\r\nto law for a few hundred francs. Rich men with a lofty spirit have\r\nrecourse to business not so much for results as for distraction. The\r\nmarquis needed a chief of staff who would put all his money affairs\r\ninto clear and lucid order. Madame de la Mole, although of so even a\r\ncharacter, sometimes made fun of Julien. Great ladies have a horror\r\nof those unexpected incidents which are produced by a sensitive\r\ncharacter; they constitute the opposite pole of etiquette. On two or\r\nthree occasions the marquis took his part. "If he is ridiculous in your\r\nsalon, he triumphs in his office." Julien on his side thought he had\r\ncaught the marquise\'s secret. She deigned to manifest an interest in\r\neverything the minute the Baron de la Joumate was announced. He was a\r\ncold individual with an expressionless physiognomy. He was tall, thin,\r\nugly, very well dressed, passed his life in his ch\xc3\xa2teau, and generally\r\nspeaking said nothing about anything. Such was his outlook on life.\r\nMadame de la Mole would have been happy for the first time in her life\r\nif she could have made him her daughter\'s husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nPRONUNCIATION\r\n\r\n\r\n        If fatuity is pardonable it is in one\'s first youth,\r\n        for it is then the exaggeration of an amiable thing. It\r\n        needs an air of love, gaiety, nonchalance. But fatuity\r\n        coupled with self-importance; fatuity with a solemn and\r\n        self-sufficient manner! This extravagance of stupidity\r\n        was reserved for the XIXth century. Such are the persons\r\n        who want to unchain the _hydra of revolutions_!--LE\r\n        JOHANNISBURG, _Pamphlet_.\r\n\r\nConsidering that he was a new arrival who was too disdainful to put any\r\nquestions, Julien did not fall into unduly great mistakes. One day when\r\nhe was forced into a caf\xc3\xa9 in the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9 by a sudden shower,\r\na big man in a beaver coat, surprised by his gloomy look, looked at\r\nhim in return just as mademoiselle Amanda\'s lover had done before at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on.\r\n\r\nJulien had reproached himself too often for having endured the other\r\ninsult to put up with this stare. He asked for an explanation. The\r\nman in the tail-coat immediately addressed him in the lowest and most\r\ninsulting language. All the people in the caf\xc3\xa9 surrounded them. The\r\npassers-by stopped before the door. Julien always carried some little\r\npistols as a matter of precaution. His hand was grasping them nervously\r\nin his pocket. Nevertheless he behaved wisely and confined himself to\r\nrepeating to his man "Monsieur, your address, I despise you."\r\n\r\nThe persistency in which he kept repeating these six words eventually\r\nimpressed the crowd.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, the other who\'s talking all to himself ought to give him\r\nhis address," they exclaimed. The man in the tail-coat hearing this\r\nrepeated several times, flung five or six cards in Julien\'s face.\r\n\r\nFortunately none of them hit him in the face; he had mentally resolved\r\nnot to use his pistols except in the event of his being hit. The man\r\nwent away, though not without turning round from time to time to shake\r\nhis fist and hurl insults at him.\r\n\r\nJulien was bathed in sweat. "So," he said angrily to himself, "the\r\nmeanest of mankind has it in his power to affect me as much as this.\r\nHow am I to kill so humiliating a sensitiveness?"\r\n\r\nWhere was he to find a second? He did not have a single friend. He had\r\nseveral acquaintances, but they all regularly left him after six weeks\r\nof social intercourse. "I am unsociable," he thought, and "I am now\r\ncruelly punished for it." Finally it occurred to him to rout out an old\r\nlieutenant of the 96th, named Li\xc3\xa9vin, a poor devil with whom he often\r\nused to fence. Julien was frank with him.\r\n\r\n"I am quite willing to be your second," said Li\xc3\xa9vin, "but on one\r\ncondition. If you fail to wound your man you will fight with me\r\nstraight away."\r\n\r\n"Agreed," said Julien quite delighted; and they went to find M. de\r\nBeauvoisis at the address indicated on his card at the end of the\r\nFaubourg Saint Germain.\r\n\r\nIt was seven o\'clock in the morning. It was only when he was being\r\nushered in, that Julien thought that it might quite well be the young\r\nrelation of Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, who had once been employed at the Rome\r\nor Naples Embassy, and who had given the singer Geronimo a letter of\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nJulien gave one of the cards which had been flung at him the previous\r\nevening together with one of his own to a tall valet.\r\n\r\nHe and his second were kept waiting for a good three-quarters of\r\nan hour. Eventually they were ushered in to a elegantly furnished\r\napartment. They found there a tall young man who was dressed like a\r\ndoll. His features presented the perfection and the lack of expression\r\nof Greek beauty. His head, which was remarkably straight, had the\r\nfinest blonde hair. It was dressed with great care and not a single\r\nhair was out of place.\r\n\r\n"It was to have his hair done like this, that is why this damned\r\nfop has kept us waiting," thought the lieutenant of the 96th. The\r\nvariegated dressing gown, the morning trousers, everything down to the\r\nembroidered slippers was correct. He was marvellously well-groomed.\r\nHis blank and aristocratic physiognomy betokened rare and orthodox\r\nideas; the ideal of a Metternichian diplomatist. Napoleon as well did\r\nnot like to have in his entourage officers who thought.\r\n\r\nJulien, to whom his lieutenant of the 96th had explained, that keeping\r\nhim waiting was an additional insult after having thrown his card\r\nso rudely in his face, entered brusquely M. de Beauvoisis\' room. He\r\nintended to be insolent, but at the same time to exhibit good form.\r\n\r\nJulien was so astonished by the niceness of M. de Beauvoisis\'\r\nmanners and by the combination of formality, self-importance, and\r\nself-satisfaction in his demeanour, by the admirable elegance of\r\neverything that surrounded him, that he abandoned immediately all\r\nidea of being insolent. It was not his man of the day before. His\r\nastonishment was so great at meeting so distinguished a person, instead\r\nof the rude creature whom he was looking for, that he could not find a\r\nsingle word to say. He presented one of the cards which had been thrown\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my name," said the young diplomat, not at all impressed by\r\nJulien\'s black suit at seven o\'clock in the morning, "but I do not\r\nunderstand the honour."\r\n\r\nHis manner of pronouncing these last words revived a little of Julien\'s\r\nbad temper.\r\n\r\n"I have come to fight you, monsieur," and he explained in a few words\r\nthe whole matter.\r\n\r\nM. Charles de Beauvoisis, after mature reflection, was fairly satisfied\r\nwith the cut of Julien\'s black suit.\r\n\r\n"It comes from Staub, that\'s clear," he said to himself, as he heard\r\nhim speak. "That waistcoat is in good taste. Those boots are all right,\r\nbut on the other hand just think of wearing a black suit in the early\r\nmorning! It must be to have a better chance of not being hit," said the\r\nchevalier de Beauvoisis to himself.\r\n\r\nAfter he had given himself this explanation he became again perfectly\r\npolite to Julien, and almost treated him as an equal. The conversation\r\nwas fairly lengthy, for the matter was a delicate one, but eventually\r\nJulien could not refuse to acknowledge the actual facts. The perfectly\r\nmannered young man before him did not bear any resemblance to the\r\nvulgar fellow who had insulted him the previous day.\r\n\r\nJulien felt an invincible repugnance towards him. He noted the\r\nself-sufficiency of the chevalier de Beauvoisis, for that was the name\r\nby which he had referred to himself, shocked as he was when Julien\r\ncalled him simply "Monsieur."\r\n\r\nHe admired his gravity which, though tinged with a certain modest\r\nfatuity, he never abandoned for a single moment. He was astonished at\r\nhis singular manner of moving his tongue as he pronounced his words,\r\nbut after all, this did not present the slightest excuse for picking a\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\nThe young diplomatist very graciously offered to fight, but the\r\nex-lieutenant of the 96th, who had been sitting down for an hour with\r\nhis legs wide apart, his hands on his thigh, and his elbows stuck out,\r\ndecided that his friend, monsieur de Sorel, was not the kind to go and\r\npick a quarrel with a man because someone else had stolen that man\'s\r\nvisiting cards.\r\n\r\nJulien went out in a very bad temper. The chevalier de Beauvoisis\'\r\ncarriage was waiting for him in the courtyard before the steps. By\r\nchance Julien raised his eyes and recognised in the coachman his man of\r\nthe day before.\r\n\r\nSeeing him, catching hold of him by his big jacket, tumbling him down\r\nfrom his seat, and horse-whipping him thoroughly took scarcely a moment.\r\n\r\nTwo lackeys tried to defend their comrade. Julien received some blows\r\nfrom their fists. At the same moment, he cocked one of his little\r\npistols and fired on them. They took to flight. All this took about a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nThe chevalier de Beauvoisis descended the staircase with the most\r\npleasing gravity, repeating with his lordly pronunciation, "What is\r\nthis, what is this." He was manifestly very curious, but his diplomatic\r\nimportance would not allow him to evince any greater interest.\r\n\r\nWhen he knew what it was all about, a certain haughtiness tried to\r\nassert itself in that expression of slightly playful nonchalance which\r\nshould never leave a diplomatist\'s face.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant of the 96th began to realise that M. de Beauvoisis was\r\nanxious to fight. He was also diplomatic enough to wish to reserve for\r\nhis friend the advantage of taking the initiative.\r\n\r\n"This time," he exclaimed, "there is ground for duel."\r\n\r\n"I think there\'s enough," answered the diplomat.\r\n\r\n"Turn that rascal out," he said to his lackeys. "Let someone else get\r\nup."\r\n\r\nThe door of the carriage was open. The chevalier insisted on doing\r\nthe honours to Julien and his friend. They sent for a friend of M. de\r\nBeauvoisis, who chose them a quiet place. The conversation on their\r\nway went as a matter of fact very well indeed. The only extraordinary\r\nfeature was the diplomatist in a dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n"These gentlemen, although very noble, are by no means as boring,"\r\nthought Julien, "as the people who come and dine at M. de la Mole\'s,\r\nand I can see why," he added a moment afterwards. "They allow\r\nthemselves to be indecent." They talked about the dancers that the\r\npublic had distinguished with its favour at the ballet presented\r\nthe night before. The two gentlemen alluded to some spicy anecdotes\r\nof which Julien and his second, the lieutenant of the 96th, were\r\nabsolutely ignorant.\r\n\r\nJulien was not stupid enough to pretend to know them. He confessed his\r\nignorance with a good grace. This frankness pleased the chevalier\'s\r\nfriend. He told him these stories with the greatest detail and\r\nextremely well.\r\n\r\nOne thing astonished Julien inordinately. The carriage was pulled up\r\nfor a moment by an altar which was being built in the middle of the\r\nstreet for the procession of Corpus Christi Day. The two gentlemen\r\nindulged in the luxury of several jests. According to them, the cur\xc3\xa9\r\nwas the son of an archbishop. Such a joke would never have been heard\r\nin the house of M. de la Mole, who was trying to be made a duke. The\r\nduel was over in a minute. Julien got a ball in his arm. They bandaged\r\nit with handkerchiefs which they wetted with brandy, and the chevalier\r\nde Beauvoisis requested Julien with great politeness to allow him to\r\ntake him home in the same carriage that had brought him. When Julien\r\ngave the name of M. de la Mole\'s h\xc3\xb4tel, the young diplomat and his\r\nfriend exchanged looks. Julien\'s fiacre was here, but they found these\r\ngentlemen\'s conversation more entertaining than that of the good\r\nlieutenant of the 96th.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, so a duel is only that," thought Julien. "What luck I found\r\nthat coachman again. How unhappy I should have been if I had had to put\r\nup with that insult as well." The amusing conversation had scarcely\r\nbeen interrupted. Julien realised that the affectation of diplomatists\r\nis good for something.\r\n\r\n"So ennui," he said himself, "is not a necessary incident of\r\nconversation among well-born people. These gentlemen make fun of the\r\nCorpus Christi procession and dare to tell extremely obscene anecdotes,\r\nand what is more, with picturesque details. The only thing they really\r\nlack is the ability to discuss politics logically, and that lack is\r\nmore than compensated by their graceful tone, and the perfect aptness\r\nof their expressions." Julien experienced a lively inclination for\r\nthem. "How happy I should be to see them often."\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely taken leave of each other before the chevalier de\r\nBeauvoisis had enquiries made. They were not brilliant.\r\n\r\nHe was very curious to know his man. Could he decently pay a call on\r\nhim? The little information he had succeeded in obtaining from him was\r\nnot of an encouraging character.\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is awful," he said to his second. "I can\'t possibly own up\r\nto having fought a duel with a mere secretary of M. de la Mole, simply\r\nbecause my coachman stole my visiting cards."\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt that all this may make you look ridiculous."\r\n\r\nThat very evening the chevalier de Beauvoisis and his friend said\r\neverywhere that this M. Sorel who was, moreover, quite a charming young\r\nman, was a natural son of an intimate friend of the marquis de la Mole.\r\nThis statement was readily accepted. Once it was established, the young\r\ndiplomatist and friend deigned to call several times on Julien during\r\nthe fortnight. Julien owned to them that he had only been to the Opera\r\nonce in his life. "That is awful," said one, "that is the only place\r\none does go to. Your first visit must be when they are playing the\r\n\'_Comte Ory_.\'"\r\n\r\nThe chevalier de Beauvoisis introduced him at the opera to the famous\r\nsinger Geronimo, who was then enjoying an immense success.\r\n\r\nJulien almost paid court to the chevalier. His mixture of self-respect,\r\nmysterious self-importance, and fatuous youthfulness fascinated him.\r\nThe chevalier, for example, would stammer a little, simply because he\r\nhad the honour of seeing frequently a very noble lord who had this\r\ndefect. Julien had never before found combined in one and the same\r\nperson the drollery which amuses, and those perfect manners which\r\nshould be the object of a poor provincial\'s imitation.\r\n\r\nHe was seen at the opera with the chevalier de Beauvoisis. This\r\nassociation got him talked about.\r\n\r\n"Well," said M. de la Mole to him one day, "so here you are, the\r\nnatural son of a rich gentleman of Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9, an intimate friend of\r\nmine."\r\n\r\nThe marquis cut Julien short as he started to protest that he had not\r\nin any way contributed to obtaining any credence for this rumour.\r\n\r\n"M. de Beauvoisis did not fancy having fought a duel with the son of a\r\ncarpenter."\r\n\r\n"I know it, I know it," said M. de la Mole. "It is my business now to\r\ngive some consistency to this story which rather suits me. But I have\r\none favour to ask of you, which will only cost you a bare half-hour of\r\nyour time. Go and watch every opera day at half-past eleven all the\r\npeople in society coming out in the vestibule. I still see you have\r\ncertain provincial mannerisms. You must rid yourself of them. Besides\r\nit would do no harm to know, at any rate by sight, some of the great\r\npersonages to whom I may one day send you on a commission. Call in at\r\nthe box office to get identified. Admission has been secured for you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nAN ATTACK OF GOUT\r\n\r\n\r\n     And I got advancement, not on my merit, but because my\r\n                master had the gout.--_Bertolotti_.\r\n\r\nThe reader is perhaps surprised by this free and almost friendly tone.\r\nWe had forgotten to say that the marquis had been confined to his house\r\nfor six weeks by the gout.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole and her mother were at Hy\xc3\xa8res near the\r\nmarquise\'s mother. The comte Norbert only saw his father at stray\r\nmoments. They got on very well, but had nothing to say to each other.\r\nM. de la Mole, reduced to Julien\'s society, was astonished to find that\r\nhe possessed ideas. He made him read the papers to him. Soon the young\r\nsecretary was competent to pick out the interesting passages. There was\r\na new paper which the marquis abhorred. He had sworn never to read it,\r\nand spoke about it every day. Julien laughed. In his irritation against\r\nthe present time, the marquis made him read Livy aloud. The improvised\r\ntranslation of the Latin text amused him. The marquis said one day\r\nin that tone of excessive politeness which frequently tried Julien\'s\r\npatience,\r\n\r\n"Allow me to present you with a blue suit, my dear Sorel. When you find\r\nit convenient to wear it and to come and see me, I shall look upon you\r\nas the younger brother of the comte de Chaulnes, that is to say, the\r\nson of my friend the old Duke."\r\n\r\nJulien did not quite gather what it was all about, but he tried a visit\r\nin the blue suit that very evening. The marquis treated him like an\r\nequal. Julien had a spirit capable of appreciating true politeness, but\r\nhe had no idea of nuances. Before this freak of the marquis\'s he would\r\nhave sworn that it was impossible for him to have been treated with\r\nmore consideration. "What an admirable talent," said Julien to himself.\r\nWhen he got up to go, the marquis apologised for not being able to\r\naccompany him by reason of his gout.\r\n\r\nJulien was preoccupied by this strange idea. "Perhaps he is making fun\r\nof me," he thought. He went to ask advice of the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard, who being\r\nless polite than the marquis, made no other answer except to whistle\r\nand change the subject.\r\n\r\nJulien presented himself to the marquis the next morning in his black\r\nsuit, with his letter case and his letters for signature. He was\r\nreceived in the old way, but when he wore the blue suit that evening,\r\nthe marquis\'s tone was quite different, and absolutely as polite as on\r\nthe previous day.\r\n\r\n"As you are not exactly bored," said the marquis to him, "by these\r\nvisits which you are kind enough to pay to a poor old man, you must\r\ntell him about all the little incidents of your life, but you must\r\nbe frank and think of nothing except narrating them clearly and in\r\nan amusing way. For one must amuse oneself," continued the marquis.\r\n"That\'s the only reality in life. I can\'t have my life saved in a\r\nbattle every day, or get a present of a million francs every day, but\r\nif I had Rivarol here by my sofa he would rid me every day of an hour\r\nof suffering and boredom. I saw a lot of him at Hamburg during the\r\nemigration."\r\n\r\nAnd the marquis told Julien the stories of Rivarol and the inhabitants\r\nof Hamburg who needed the combined efforts of four individuals to\r\nunderstand an epigram. M. de la Mole, being reduced to the society of\r\nthis little abb\xc3\xa9, tried to teach him. He put Julien\'s pride on its\r\nmettle. As he was asked to speak the truth, Julien resolved to tell\r\neverything, but to suppress two things, his fanatical admiration for\r\nthe name which irritated the marquis, and that complete scepticism,\r\nwhich was not particularly appropriate to a prospective cur\xc3\xa9. His\r\nlittle affair with the chevalier de Beauvoisis came in very handy. The\r\nmarquis laughed till the tears came into his eyes at the scene in the\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9 in the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9 with the coachman who had loaded him with\r\nsordid insults. The occasion was marked by a complete frankness between\r\nthe marquis and the prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nM. de la Mole became interested in this singular character. At the\r\nbeginning he had encouraged Julian\'s droll blunders in order to enjoy\r\nlaughing at them. Soon he found it more interesting to correct very\r\ngently this young man\'s false outlook on life.\r\n\r\n"All other provincials who come to Paris admire everything,"\r\nthought the marquis. "This one hates everything. They have too much\r\naffectation; he has not affectation enough; and fools take him for a\r\nfool."\r\n\r\nThe attack of gout was protracted by the great winter cold and lasted\r\nsome months.\r\n\r\n"One gets quite attached to a fine spaniel," thought the marquis. "Why\r\nshould I be so ashamed of being attached to this little abb\xc3\xa9? He is\r\noriginal. I treat him as a son. Well, where\'s the bother? The whim, if\r\nit lasts, will cost me a diamond and five hundred louis in my will."\r\nOnce the marquis had realised his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9\'s strength of character, he\r\nentrusted him with some new business every day.\r\n\r\nJulien noticed with alarm that this great lord would often give him\r\ninconsistent orders with regard to the same matter.\r\n\r\nThat might compromise him seriously. Julien now made a point whenever\r\nhe worked with him, of bringing a register with him in which he wrote\r\nhis instructions which the marquis initialled. Julien had now a clerk\r\nwho would transcribe the instructions relating to each matter in a\r\nseparate book. This book also contained a copy of all the letters.\r\n\r\nThis idea seemed at first absolutely boring and ridiculous, but in two\r\nmonths the marquis appreciated its advantages. Julien suggested to him\r\nthat he should take a clerk out of a banker\'s who was to keep proper\r\nbook-keeping accounts of all the receipts and of all the expenses of\r\nthe estates which Julien had been charged to administer.\r\n\r\nThese measures so enlightened the marquis as to his own affairs that\r\nhe could indulge the pleasure of undertaking two or three speculations\r\nwithout the help of his nominee who always robbed him.\r\n\r\n"Take three thousand francs for yourself," he said one day to his young\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, I should lay myself open to calumny."\r\n\r\n"What do you want then?" retorted the marquis irritably.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will be kind enough to make out a statement of account and\r\nenter it in your own hand in the book. That order will give me a sum of\r\n3,000 francs. Besides it\'s M. the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard who had the idea of all\r\nthis exactness in accounts." The marquis wrote out his instructions in\r\nthe register with the bored air of the Marquis de Moncade listening to\r\nthe accounts of his steward M. Poisson.\r\n\r\nBusiness was never talked when Julien appeared in the evening in\r\nhis blue suit. The kindness of the marquis was so flattering to the\r\nself-respect of our hero, which was always morbidly sensitive, that\r\nin spite of himself, he soon came to feel a kind of attachment for\r\nthis nice old man. It is not that Julien was a man of sensibility\r\nas the phrase is understood at Paris, but he was not a monster, and\r\nno one since the death of the old major had talked to him with so\r\nmuch kindness. He observed that the marquis showed a politeness and\r\nconsideration for his own personal feelings which he had never found in\r\nthe old surgeon. He now realised that the surgeon was much prouder of\r\nhis cross than was the marquis of his blue ribbon. The marquis\'s father\r\nhad been a great lord.\r\n\r\nOne day, at the end of a morning audience for the transaction of\r\nbusiness, when the black suit was worn, Julien happened to amuse the\r\nmarquis who kept him for a couple of hours, and insisted on giving him\r\nsome banknotes which his nominee had just brought from the house.\r\n\r\n"I hope M. le Marquis, that I am not deviating from the profound\r\nrespect which I owe you, if I beg you to allow me to say a word."\r\n\r\n"Speak, my friend."\r\n\r\n"M. le Marquis will deign to allow me to refuse this gift. It is not\r\nmeant for the man in the black suit, and it would completely spoil\r\nthose manners which you have kindly put up with in the man in the blue\r\nsuit." He saluted with much respect and went out without looking at his\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nThis incident amused the marquis. He told it in the evening to the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nPirard.\r\n\r\n"I must confess one thing to you, my dear abb\xc3\xa9. I know Julien\'s birth,\r\nand I authorise you not to regard this confidence as a secret."\r\n\r\nHis conduct this morning is noble, thought the marquis, so I will\r\nennoble him myself.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards the marquis was able to go out.\r\n\r\n"Go and pass a couple of months at London," he said to Julien.\r\n"Ordinary and special couriers will bring you the letters I have\r\nreceived, together with my notes. You will write out the answers and\r\nsend them back to me, putting each letter inside the answer. I have\r\nascertained that the delay will be no more than five days."\r\n\r\nAs he took the post down the Calais route, Julien was astonished at the\r\ntriviality of the alleged business on which he had been sent.\r\n\r\nWe will say nothing about the feeling of hate and almost horror with\r\nwhich he touched English soil. His mad passion for Bonaparte is already\r\nknown. He saw in every officer a Sir Hudson Low, in every great\r\nnoble a Lord Bathurst, ordering the infamies of St. Helena and being\r\nrecompensed by six years of office.\r\n\r\nAt London he really got to know the meaning of sublime fatuity. He had\r\nstruck up a friendship with some young Russian nobles who initiated him.\r\n\r\n"Your future is assured, my dear Sorel," they said to him. "You\r\nnaturally have that cold demeanour, _a thousand leagues away from the\r\nsensation one has at the moment_, that we have been making such efforts\r\nto acquire."\r\n\r\n"You have not understood your century," said the Prince Korasoff to\r\nhim. "Always do the opposite of what is expected of you. On my honour\r\nthere you have the sole religion of the period. Don\'t be foolish or\r\naffected, for then follies and affectations will be expected of you,\r\nand the maxim will not longer prove true."\r\n\r\nJulien covered himself with glory one day in the Salon of the Duke\r\nof Fitz-Folke who had invited him to dinner together with the Prince\r\nKorasoff. They waited for an hour. The way in which Julien conducted\r\nhimself in the middle of twenty people who were waiting is still quoted\r\nas a precedent among the young secretaries of the London Embassy. His\r\ndemeanour was unimpeachable.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his friends, the dandies, he made a point of seeing the\r\ncelebrated Philip Vane, the one philosopher that England has had\r\nsince Locke. He found him finishing his seventh year in prison. The\r\naristocracy doesn\'t joke in this country, thought Julien. Moreover Vane\r\nis disgraced, calumniated, etc.\r\n\r\nJulien found him in cheery spirits. The rage of the aristocracy\r\nprevented him from being bored. "There\'s the only merry man I\'ve seen\r\nin England," thought Julien to himself, as he left the prison.\r\n\r\n"The idea which tyrants find most useful is the idea of God," Vane had\r\nsaid to him.\r\n\r\nWe suppress the rest of the system as being cynical.\r\n\r\n"What amusing notion do you bring me from England?" said M. la Mole to\r\nhim on his return. He was silent. "What notion do you bring me, amusing\r\nor otherwise?" repeated the marquis sharply.\r\n\r\n"In the first place," said Julien, "The sanest Englishman is mad one\r\nhour every day. He is visited by the Demon of Suicide who is the local\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n"In the second place, intellect and genius lose twenty-five per cent.\r\nof their value when they disembark in England.\r\n\r\n"In the third place, nothing in the world is so beautiful, so\r\nadmirable, so touching, as the English landscapes."\r\n\r\n"Now it is my turn," said the marquis.\r\n\r\n"In the first place, why do you go and say at the ball at the Russian\r\nAmbassador\'s that there were three hundred thousand young men of twenty\r\nin France who passionately desire war? Do you think that is nice for\r\nthe kings?"\r\n\r\n"One doesn\'t know what to do when talking to great diplomats," said\r\nJulien. "They have a mania for starting serious discussions. If one\r\nconfines oneself to the commonplaces of the papers, one is taken for a\r\nfool. If one indulges in some original truth, they are astonished and\r\nat a loss for an answer, and get you informed by the first Secretary\r\nof the Embassy at seven o\'clock next day that your conduct has been\r\nunbecoming."\r\n\r\n"Not bad," said the marquis laughing. "Anyway I will wager Monsieur\r\nDeep-one that you have not guessed what you went to do in England."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," answered Julien. "I went there to dine once a week with\r\nthe king\'s ambassador, who is the most polite of men."\r\n\r\n"You went to fetch this cross you see here," said the marquis to him.\r\n"I do not want to make you leave off your black suit, and I have got\r\naccustomed to the more amusing tone I have assumed with the man who\r\nwears the blue suit. So understand this until further orders. When I\r\nsee this cross, you will be my friend, the Duke of Chaulne\'s younger\r\nson, who has been employed in the diplomatic service the last six\r\nmonths without having any idea of it. Observe," added the marquis\r\nvery seriously, cutting short all manifestations of thanks, "that I\r\ndo not want you to forget your place. That is always a mistake and a\r\nmisfortune both for patron and for dependent. When my lawsuits bore\r\nyou, or when you no longer suit me, I will ask a good living like that\r\nof our good friend the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard\'s for you, and nothing more," added\r\nthe marquis dryly. This put Julien\'s pride at its ease. He talked much\r\nmore. He did not so frequently think himself insulted and aimed at by\r\nthose phrases which are susceptible of some interpretation which is\r\nscarcely polite, and which anybody may give utterance to in the course\r\nof an animated conversation.\r\n\r\nThis cross earned him a singular visit. It was that of the baron de\r\nValenod, who came to Paris to thank the Minister for his barony, and\r\narrive at an understanding with him. He was going to be nominated mayor\r\nof Verri\xc3\xa8res, and to supersede M. de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nJulien did not fail to smile to himself when M. Valenod gave him to\r\nunderstand that they had just found out that M. de R\xc3\xaanal was a Jacobin.\r\nThe fact was that the new baron was the ministerial candidate at the\r\nelection for which they were all getting ready, and that it was M. de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal who was the Liberal candidate at the great electoral college of\r\nthe department, which was, in fact, very ultra.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Julien tried to learn something about madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal. The baron seemed to remember their former rivalry, and was\r\nimpenetrable. He concluded by canvassing Julien for his father\'s vote\r\nat the election which was going to take place. Julien promised to write.\r\n\r\n"You ought, monsieur le Chevalier, to present me to M. the marquis de\r\nla Mole."\r\n\r\n"I ought, as a matter of fact," thought Julien. "But a rascal like\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact," he answered, "I am too small a personage in the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole to take it upon myself to introduce anyone." Julien\r\ntold the marquis everything. In the evening he described Valenod\'s\r\npretensions, as well as his deeds and feats since 1814.\r\n\r\n"Not only will you present the new baron to me," replied de la Mole,\r\nvery seriously, "but I will invite him to dinner for the day after\r\nto-morrow. He will be one of our new prefects."\r\n\r\n"If that is the case, I ask for my father the post of director of the\r\nworkhouse," answered Julien, coldly.\r\n\r\n"With pleasure," answered the marquis gaily. "It shall be granted. I\r\nwas expecting a lecture. You are getting on."\r\n\r\nM. de Valenod informed Julien that the manager of the lottery office at\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res had just died. Julien thought it humorous to give that place\r\nto M. de Cholin, the old dotard whose petition he had once picked up in\r\nde la Mole\'s room. The marquis laughed heartily at the petition, which\r\nJulien recited as he made him sign the letter which requested that\r\nappointment of the minister of finance.\r\n\r\nM. de Cholin had scarcely been nominated, when Julien learnt that that\r\npost had been asked by the department for the celebrated geometrician,\r\nmonsieur Gros. That generous man had an income of only 1400 francs, and\r\nevery year had lent 600 to the late manager who had just died, to help\r\nhim bring up his family.\r\n\r\nJulien was astonished at what he had done.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nothing," he said to himself. "It will be necessary to commit\r\nseveral other injustices if I mean to get on, and also to conceal them\r\nbeneath pretty, sentimental speeches. Poor monsieur Gros! It is he who\r\ndeserves the cross. It is I who have it, and I ought to conform to the\r\nspirit of the Government which gives it me."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DECORATION WHICH CONFERS DISTINCTION?\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Thy water refreshes me not," said the transformed genie.\r\n    "\'Tis nevertheless the freshest well in all Diar-B\xc3\xa9kir"--_Pellico_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day Julien had just returned from the charming estate of Villequier\r\non the banks of the Seine, which was the especial subject of M. de la\r\nMole\'s interest because it was the only one of all his properties which\r\nhad belonged to the celebrated Boniface de la Mole.\r\n\r\nHe found the marquise and her daughter, who had just come back from\r\nHy\xc3\xa8res, in the hotel. Julien was a dandy now, and understood the art of\r\nParis life. He manifested a perfect coldness towards mademoiselle de la\r\nMole. He seemed to have retained no recollection of the day when she\r\nhad asked him so gaily for details of his fall from his horse.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole thought that he had grown taller and paler.\r\nThere was no longer anything of the provincial in his figure or his\r\nappearance. It was not so with his conversation. Too much of the\r\nserious and too much of the positive element were still noticeable. In\r\nspite of these sober qualities, his conversation, thanks to his pride,\r\nwas destitute of any trace of the subordinate. One simply felt that\r\nthere were still too many things which he took seriously. But one saw\r\nthat he was the kind of man to stick to his guns.\r\n\r\n"He lacks lightness of touch, but not brains," said mademoiselle de la\r\nMole to her father, as she rallied him on the cross that he had given\r\nJulien. "My brother has been asking you for it for sixteen months, and\r\nhe is a La Mole."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but Julien has surprises, and that\'s what the de la Mole, whom\r\nyou were referring to, has never been guilty of."\r\n\r\nM. the duc de Retz was announced.\r\n\r\nMathilde felt herself seized by an irresistible attack of yawning. She\r\nknew so well the old gildings and the old habitu\xc3\xa9s of her father\'s\r\nsalon. She conjured up an absolutely boring picture of the life which\r\nshe was going to take up at Paris, and yet, when at Hy\xc3\xa8res, she had\r\nregretted Paris.\r\n\r\n"And yet I am nineteen," she thought. "That\'s the age of happiness, say\r\nall those gilt-edged ninnies."\r\n\r\nShe looked at eight or ten new volumes of poetry which had accumulated\r\non the table in the salon during her journey in Provence. She had the\r\nmisfortune to have more brains than M.M. de Croisnois, de Caylus, de\r\nLuz, and her other friends. She anticipated all that they were going to\r\ntell her about the fine sky of Provence, poetry, the South, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThese fine eyes, which were the home of the deepest ennui, and worse\r\nstill, of the despair of ever finding pleasure, lingered on Julien. At\r\nany rate, he was not exactly like the others.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Sorel," she said, in that short, sharp voice, destitute of\r\nall femininity, which is so frequent among young women of the upper\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Sorel, are you coming to-night to M. de Retz\'s ball?"\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle, I have not had the honour of being presented to M. the\r\nduke." (One would have said that these words and that title seared the\r\nmouth of the proud provincial).\r\n\r\n"He asked my brother to take you there, and if you go, you could\r\ntell me some details about the Villequier estate. We are thinking of\r\ngoing there in the spring, and I would like to know if the ch\xc3\xa2teau is\r\nhabitable, and if the neighbouring places are as pretty as they say.\r\nThere are so many unmerited reputations."\r\n\r\nJulien did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Come to the ball with my brother," she added, very dryly. Julien bowed\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\n"So I owe my due to the members of the family, even in the middle of a\r\nball. Am I not paid to be their business man?" His bad temper added,\r\n"God knows, moreover, if what I tell the daughter will not put out the\r\nplans of the father, brother, and mother. It is just like the court of\r\na sovereign prince. You have to be absolutely negative, and yet give no\r\none any right to complain."\r\n\r\n"How that big girl displeases me!" he thought, as he watched the walk\r\nof Mademoiselle de la Mole, whom her mother had called to present to\r\nseveral women friends of hers. She exaggerates all the fashions. Her\r\ndress almost falls down to her shoulders, she is even paler than before\r\nshe went away. How nondescript her hair has grown as the result of\r\nbeing blonde! You would say that the light passed through it.\r\n\r\nWhat a haughty way of bowing and of looking at you! What queenly\r\ngestures! Mademoiselle de la Mole had just called her brother at the\r\nmoment when he was leaving the salon.\r\n\r\nThe comte de Norbert approached Julien.\r\n\r\n"My dear Sorel," he said to him. "Where would you like me to pick you\r\nup to-night for Monsieur\'s ball. He expressly asked me to bring you."\r\n\r\n"I know well whom I have to thank for so much kindness," answered\r\nJulien bowing to the ground.\r\n\r\nHis bad temper, being unable to find anything to lay hold of in the\r\npolite and almost sympathetic tone in which Norbert had spoken to\r\nhim, set itself to work on the answer he had made to that courteous\r\ninvitation. He detected in it a trace of subservience.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the ball in the evening, he was struck with the\r\nmagnificence of the H\xc3\xb4tel de Retz. The courtyard at the entrance was\r\ncovered with an immense tent of crimson with golden stars. Nothing\r\ncould have been more elegant. Beyond the tent, the court had been\r\ntransformed into a wood of orange trees and of pink laurels in full\r\nflower. As they had been careful to bury the vases sufficiently deep,\r\nthe laurel trees and the orange trees appeared to come straight out of\r\nthe ground. The road which the carriages traversed was sanded.\r\n\r\nAll this seemed extraordinary to our provincial. He had never had any\r\nidea of such magnificence. In a single instant his thrilled imagination\r\nhad left his bad temper a thousand leagues behind. In the carriage on\r\ntheir way to the ball Norbert had been happy, while he saw everything\r\nin black colours. They had scarcely entered the courtyard before the\r\nr\xc3\xb4les changed.\r\n\r\nNorbert was only struck by a few details which, in the midst of all\r\nthat magnificence, had not been able to be attended to. He calculated\r\nthe expense of each item, and Julien remarked that the nearer he got\r\nto a sum total, the more jealous and bad-tempered he appeared.\r\n\r\nAs for himself, he was fascinated and full of admiration when he\r\nreached the first of the salons where they were dancing. His emotion\r\nwas so great that it almost made him nervous. There was a crush at the\r\ndoor of the second salon, and the crowd was so great that he found it\r\nimpossible to advance. The decorations of the second salon presented\r\nthe Alhambra of Grenada.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the queen of the ball one must admit," said a young man with a\r\nmoustache whose shoulder stuck into Julien\'s chest.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle Formant who has been the prettiest all the winter,\r\nrealises that she will have to go down to the second place. See how\r\nstrange she looks."\r\n\r\n"In truth she is straining every nerve to please. Just look at that\r\ngracious smile now that she is doing the figure in that quadrille all\r\nalone. On my honour it is unique."\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle de la Mole looks as if she controlled the pleasure which\r\nshe derives from her triumph, of which she is perfectly conscious. One\r\nmight say that she fears to please anyone who talks to her."\r\n\r\n"Very good. That is the art of alluring."\r\n\r\nJulien vainly endeavoured to catch sight of the alluring woman. Seven\r\nor eight men who were taller than he prevented him from seeing her.\r\n\r\n"There is quite a lot of coquetry in that noble reserve," said the\r\nyoung man with a moustache.\r\n\r\n"And in those big blue eyes, which are lowered so slowly when one would\r\nthink they were on the point of betraying themselves," answered his\r\nneighbour. "On my faith, nothing could be cleverer."\r\n\r\n"See the pretty Formant looking quite common next to her," said the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n"That air of reserve means how much sweetness would I spend on you if\r\nyou were the man who was worthy of me."\r\n\r\n"And who could be worthy of the sublime Mathilde," said the first man.\r\n"Some sovereign prince, handsome, witty, well-made, a hero in war, and\r\ntwenty years old at the most."\r\n\r\n"The natural son of the Emperor of Russia ... who would be made a\r\nsovereign in honour of his marriage, or quite simply the comte de\r\nThaler, who looks like a dressed-up peasant."\r\n\r\nThe door was free, and Julien could go in.\r\n\r\n"Since these puppets consider her so remarkable, it is worth while\r\nfor me to study her," he thought. "I shall then understand what these\r\npeople regard as perfection."\r\n\r\nAs his eyes were trying to find her, Mathilde looked at him. "My duty\r\ncalls me," said Julien to himself. But it was only his expression which\r\nwas bad-humoured.\r\n\r\nHis curiosity made him advance with a pleasure which the extremely low\r\ncut dress on Mathilde\'s shoulder very quickly accentuated, in a manner\r\nwhich was scarcely flattering for his own self-respect. "Her beauty has\r\nyouth," he thought. Five or six people, whom Julien recognised as those\r\nwho had been speaking at the door were between her and him.\r\n\r\n"Now, Monsieur, you have been here all the winter," she said to him.\r\n"Is it not true that this is the finest ball of the season."\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.\r\n\r\n"This quadrille of Coulon\'s strikes me as admirable, and those ladies\r\ndance it perfectly." The young men turned round to see who was the\r\nhappy man, an answer from whom was positively insisted on. The answer\r\nwas not encouraging.\r\n\r\n"I shall not be able to be a good judge, mademoiselle, I pass my life\r\nin writing. This is the first ball of this magnificence which I have\r\never seen."\r\n\r\nThe young men with moustaches were scandalised.\r\n\r\n"You are a wise man, Monsieur Sorel," came the answer with a more\r\nmarked interest. "You look upon all these balls, all these festivities,\r\nlike a philosopher, like J. J. Rousseau. All these follies astonish\r\nwithout alluring you."\r\n\r\nJulien\'s imagination had just hit upon an epigram which banished all\r\nillusions from his mind. His mouth assumed the expression of a perhaps\r\nslightly exaggerated disdain.\r\n\r\n"J. J. Rousseau," he answered, "is in my view only a fool when he takes\r\nit upon himself to criticise society. He did not understand it, and\r\nhe went into it with the spirit of a lackey who has risen above his\r\nstation."\r\n\r\n"He wrote the _Contrat Social_," answered Mathilde reverently.\r\n\r\n"While he preaches the Republic, and the overthrow of monarchical\r\ndignities, the parvenu was intoxicated with happiness if a duke would\r\ngo out of his way after dinner to one of his friends."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, the Duke of Luxembourg at Montmorency, used to accompany a\r\nCoindet from the neighbourhood of Paris," went on Mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole, with all the pleasure and enthusiasm of her first flush of\r\npedantry. She was intoxicated with her knowledge, almost like the\r\nacademician who discovered the existence of King Feretrius.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s look was still penetrating and severe. Mathilde had had\r\na moment\'s enthusiasm. Her partner\'s coldness disconcerted her\r\nprofoundly. She was all the more astonished, as it was she who was\r\naccustomed to produce that particular effect on others.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the marquis de Croisenois was advancing eagerly towards\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole. He was for a moment three yards away from her.\r\nHe was unable to get closer because of the crowd. He smiled at the\r\nobstacle. The young marquise de Rouvray was near her. She was a cousin\r\nof Mathilde. She was giving her arm to her husband who had only married\r\nher a fortnight ago. The marquis de Rouvray, who was also very young,\r\nhad all the love which seizes a man who, having contracted a marriage\r\nof convenience exclusively arranged by the notaries, finds a person who\r\nis ideally pretty. M. de Rouvray would be a duke on the death of a very\r\nold uncle.\r\n\r\nWhile the marquis de Croisenois was struggling to get through the\r\ncrowd, and smiling at Mathilde she fixed her big divinely blue eyes\r\non him and his neighbours. "Could anything be flatter," she said to\r\nherself. "There is Croisenois who wants to marry me, he is gentle and\r\npolite, he has perfect manners like M. de Rouvray. If they did not\r\nbore, those gentlemen would be quite charming. He too, would accompany\r\nme to the ball with that smug limited expression. One year after the\r\nmarriage I shall have my carriage, my horses, my dresses, my ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\ntwenty leagues from Paris. All this would be as nice as possible, and\r\nenough to make a Countess de Roiville, for example, die of envy and\r\nafterwards--"\r\n\r\nMathilde bored herself in anticipation. The marquis de Croisenois\r\nmanaged to approach her and spoke to her, but she was dreaming and\r\ndid not listen to him. The noise of his words began to get mixed\r\nwith the buzz of the ball. Her eye mechanically followed Julien who\r\nhad gone away, with an air which, though respectful, was yet proud\r\nand discontented. She noticed in a corner far from the moving crowd,\r\nthe comte Altamira who had been condemned to death in his own country\r\nand whom the reader knows already. One of his relatives had married a\r\nPrince de Conti in the reign of Louis XIV. This historical fact was\r\nsome protection against the police of the congregation.\r\n\r\n"I think being condemned to death is the only real distinction," said\r\nMathilde. "It is the only thing which cannot be bought."\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s an epigram, I just said, what a pity it did not come at a\r\nmoment when I could have reaped all the credit for it." Mathilde had\r\ntoo much taste to work into the conversation a prepared epigram but\r\nat the same time she was too vain not to be extremely pleased with\r\nherself. A happy expression succeeded the palpable boredom of her face.\r\nThe marquis de Croisenois, who had never left off talking, saw a chance\r\nof success and waxed twice as eloquent.\r\n\r\n"What objection could a caviller find with my epigram," said Mathilde\r\nto herself. "I would answer my critic in this way: The title of baron\r\nor vicomte is to be bought; a cross, why it is a gift. My brother\r\nhas just got one. What has he done? A promotion, why that can be\r\nobtained by being ten years in a garrison or have the minister of war\r\nfor a relative, and you\'ll be a chief of a squadron like Norbert. A\r\ngreat fortune! That\'s rather more difficult, and consequently more\r\nmeritorious. It is really quite funny. It\'s the opposite of what\r\nthe books say. Well, to win a fortune why you marry M. Rothschild\'s\r\ndaughter. Really my epigram is quite deep. Being condemned to death is\r\nstill the one privilege which one has never thought of canvassing."\r\n\r\n"Do you know the comte Altamira," she said to M. de Croisenois.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts seemed to have been so far away, and this question had\r\nso little connection with all that the poor marquis had been saying\r\nfor the last five minutes, that his good temper was ruffled. He was\r\nnevertheless a man of wit and celebrated for being so.\r\n\r\n"Mathilde is eccentric," he thought, "that\'s a nuisance, but she will\r\ngive her husband such a fine social position. I don\'t know how the\r\nmarquis de la Mole manages. He is connected with all that is best in\r\nall parties. He is a man who is bound to come out on top. And, besides,\r\nthis eccentricity of Mathilde\'s may pass for genius. Genius when allied\r\nwith good birth and a large fortune, so far from being ridiculous, is\r\nhighly distinguished. She has wit, moreover, when she wants to, that\r\nmixture in fact of brains, character, and ready wit which constitute\r\nperfection."\r\n\r\nAs it is difficult to do two things at the same time, the marquis\r\nanswered Mathilde with a vacant expression as though he were reciting a\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n"Who does not know that poor Altamira?" and he told her the history of\r\nhis conspiracy, abortive, ridiculous and absurd.\r\n\r\n"Very absurd," said Mathilde as if she were talking to herself, "but he\r\nhas done something. I want to see a man; bring him to me," she said to\r\nthe scandalized marquis.\r\n\r\nComte Altamira was one of the most avowed admirers of mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole\'s haughty and impertinent manner. In his opinion she was one of\r\nthe most beautiful persons in Paris.\r\n\r\n"How fine she would be on a throne," he said to M. de Croisenois; and\r\nmade no demur at being taken up to Mathilde.\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of people in society who would like to\r\nestablish the fact that nothing is in such bad form as a conspiracy, in\r\nthe nineteenth century; it smacks of Jacobinism. And what could be more\r\nsordid than unsuccessful Jacobinism.\r\n\r\nMathilde\'s expression made fun a little of Altamira and M. de\r\nCroisenois, but she listened to him with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"A conspirator at a ball, what a pretty contrast," she thought. She\r\nthought that this man with his black moustache looked like a lion at\r\nrest, but she soon perceived that his mind had only one point of view:\r\n_utility, admiration for utility_.\r\n\r\nThe young comte thought nothing worthy his attention except what tended\r\nto give his country two chamber government. He left Mathilde, who was\r\nthe prettiest person at the ball, with alacrity, because he saw a\r\nPeruvian general come in. Desparing of Europe such as M. de Metternich\r\nhad arranged it, poor Altamira had been reduced to thinking that when\r\nthe States of South America had become strong and powerful they could\r\nrestore to Europe the liberty which Mirabeau has given it.\r\n\r\nA crowd of moustachised young men had approached Mathilde. She realized\r\nthat Altamira had not felt allured, and was piqued by his departure.\r\nShe saw his black eye gleam as he talked to the Peruvian general.\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole looked at the young Frenchmen with that\r\nprofound seriousness which none of her rivals could imitate, "which\r\nof them," she thought, "could get himself condemned to death, even\r\nsupposing he had a favourable opportunity?"\r\n\r\nThis singular look flattered those who were not very intelligent, but\r\ndisconcerted the others. They feared the discharge of some stinging\r\nepigram that would be difficult to answer.\r\n\r\n"Good birth vouchsafes a hundred qualities whose absence would offend\r\nme. I see as much in the case of Julien," thought Mathilde, "but it\r\nwithers up those qualities of soul which make a man get condemned to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\nAt that moment some one was saying near her: "Comte Altamira is the\r\nsecond son of the Prince of San Nazaro-Pimentel; it was a Pimentel who\r\ntried to save Conradin, was beheaded in 1268. It is one of the noblest\r\nfamilies in Naples."\r\n\r\n"So," said Mathilde to herself, "what a pretty proof this is of my\r\nmaxim, that good birth deprives a man of that force of character\r\nin default of which a man does not get condemned to death. I seem\r\ndoomed to reason falsely to-night. Since I am only a woman like any\r\nother, well I must dance." She yielded to the solicitations of M. de\r\nCroisenois who had been asking for a gallop for the last hour. To\r\ndistract herself from her failure in philosophy, Mathilde made a point\r\nof being perfectly fascinating. M. de Croisenois was enchanted. But\r\nneither the dance nor her wish to please one of the handsomest men at\r\ncourt, nor anything at all, succeeded in distracting Mathilde. She\r\ncould not possibly have been more of a success. She was the queen of\r\nthe ball. She coldly appreciated the fact.\r\n\r\n"What a blank life I shall pass with a person like Croisenois," she\r\nsaid to herself as he took her back to her place an hour afterwards.\r\n"What pleasure do I get," she added sadly, "if after an absence of\r\nsix months I find myself at a ball which all the women of Paris were\r\nmad with jealousy to go to? And what is more I am surrounded by the\r\nhomage of an ideally constituted circle of society. The only bourgeois\r\nare some peers and perhaps one or two Juliens. And yet," she added\r\nwith increasing sadness, "what advantages has not fate bestowed upon\r\nme! Distinction, fortune, youth, everything except happiness. My most\r\ndubious advantages are the very ones they have been speaking to me\r\nabout all the evening. Wit, I believe I have it, because I obviously\r\nfrighten everyone. If they venture to tackle a serious subject, they\r\nwill arrive after five minutes of conversation and as though they had\r\nmade a great discovery at a conclusion which we have been repeating to\r\nthem for the last hour. I am beautiful, I have that advantage for which\r\nmadame de Stael would have sacrificed everything, and yet I\'m dying of\r\nboredom. Shall I have reason to be less bored when I have changed my\r\nname for that of the marquis de Croisenois?\r\n\r\n"My God though," she added, while she almost felt as if she would like\r\nto cry, "isn\'t he really quite perfect? He\'s a paragon of the education\r\nof the age; you can\'t look at him without his finding something\r\ncharming and even witty to say to you; he is brave. But that Sorel is\r\nstrange," she said to herself, and the expression of her eyes changed\r\nfrom melancholy to anger. "I told him that I had something to say to\r\nhim and he hasn\'t deigned to reappear."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE BALL\r\n\r\n\r\n        The luxurious dresses, the glitter of the candles; all\r\n        those pretty arms and fine shoulders; the bouquets,\r\n        the intoxicating strains of Rossini, the paintings of\r\n        Ciceri. I am beside myself.--_Journeys of Useri_.\r\n\r\n\r\n"You are in a bad temper," said the marquise de la Mole to her; "let me\r\ncaution you, it is ungracious at a ball."\r\n\r\n"I only have a headache," answered Mathilde disdainfully, "it is too\r\nhot here."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the old Baron Tolly became ill and fell down, as though\r\nto justify mademoiselle de la Mole\'s remark. They were obliged to carry\r\nhim away. They talked about apoplexy. It was a disagreeable incident.\r\n\r\nMathilde did not bother much about it.\r\n\r\nShe made a point of never looking at old men, or at anyone who had the\r\nreputation of being bad company.\r\n\r\nShe danced in order to escape the conversation about the apoplexy,\r\nwhich was not apoplexy inasmuch as the baron put in an appearance the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\n"But Sorel does not come," she said to herself after she had danced.\r\nShe was almost looking round for him when she found him in another\r\nsalon. Astonishing, but he seemed to have lost that impassive coldness\r\nthat was so natural to him; he no longer looked English.\r\n\r\n"He is talking to comte Altamira who was sentenced to death," said\r\nMathilde to herself. "His eye is full of a sombre fire; he looks like a\r\nprince in disguise; his haughtiness has become twice as pronounced."\r\n\r\nJulien came back to where she was, still talking to Altamira. She\r\nlooked at Altamira fixedly, studying his features in order to trace\r\nthose lofty qualities which can earn a man the honour of being\r\ncondemned to death.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he was saying to comte Altamira as he passed by her, "Danton was\r\na real man."\r\n\r\n"Heavens can he be a Danton?" said Mathilde to herself, "but he has\r\nso noble a face, and that Danton was so horribly ugly, a butcher I\r\nbelieve." Julien was still fairly near her. She did not hesitate to\r\ncall him; she had the consciousness and the pride of putting a question\r\nthat was unusual for a young girl.\r\n\r\n"Was not Danton a butcher?" she said to him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, in the eyes of certain persons," Julien answered her with the\r\nmost thinly disguised expression of contempt. His eyes were still\r\nardent from his conversation with Altamira, "but unfortunately for\r\nthe people of good birth he was an advocate at M\xc3\xa9ry-sur-Seine, that\r\nis to say, mademoiselle," he added maliciously, "he began like many\r\npeers whom I see here. It was true that Danton laboured under a great\r\ndisadvantage in the eyes of beauty; he was ugly."\r\n\r\nThese last few words were spoken rapidly in an extraordinary and indeed\r\nvery discourteous manner.\r\n\r\nJulien waited for a moment, leaning slightly forward and with an air of\r\nproud humility. He seemed to be saying, "I am paid to answer you and I\r\nlive on my pay." He did not deign to look up at Mathilde. She looked\r\nlike his slave with her fine eyes open abnormally wide and fixed on\r\nhim. Finally as the silence continued he looked at her, like a valet\r\nlooking at his master to receive orders. Although his eyes met the full\r\ngaze of Mathilde which were fixed on him all the time with a strange\r\nexpression, he went away with a marked eagerness.\r\n\r\n"To think of a man who is as handsome as he is," said Mathilde to\r\nherself as she emerged from her reverie, "praising ugliness in such a\r\nway, he is not like Caylus or Croisenois. This Sorel has something like\r\nmy father\'s look when he goes to a fancy dress ball as Napoleon." She\r\nhad completely forgotten Danton. "Yes, I am decidedly bored to-night."\r\nShe took her brother\'s arm and to his great disgust made him take\r\nher round the ball-room. The idea occurred to her of following the\r\nconversation between Julien and the man who had been condemned to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was enormous. She managed to find them, however, at the\r\nmoment when two yards in front of her Altamira was going near a\r\ndumb-waiter to take an ice. He was talking to Julien with his body half\r\nturned round. He saw an arm in an embroidered coat which was taking an\r\nice close by. The embroidery seemed to attract his attention. He turned\r\nround to look at the person to whom the arm belonged. His noble and yet\r\nsimple eyes immediately assumed a slightly disdainful expression.\r\n\r\n"You see that man," he said to Julien in a low voice; "that is the\r\nPrince of Araceli Ambassador of ----. He asked M. de Nerval, your\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, for my extradition this morning. See,\r\nthere he is over there playing whist. Monsieur de Nerval is willing\r\nenough to give me up, for we gave up two or three conspirators to you\r\nin 1816. If I am given up to my king I shall be hanged in twenty-four\r\nhours. It will be one of those handsome moustachioed gentlemen who will\r\narrest me."\r\n\r\n"The wretches!" exclaimed Julien half aloud.\r\n\r\nMathilde did not lose a syllable of their conversation. Her ennui had\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n"They are not scoundrels," replied Count Altamira. "I talk to you about\r\nmyself in order to give you a vivid impression. Look at the Prince of\r\nAraceli. He casts his eyes on his golden fleece every five minutes; he\r\ncannot get over the pleasure of seeing that decoration on his breast.\r\nIn reality the poor man is really an anachronism. The fleece was a\r\nsignal honour a hundred years ago, but he would have been nowhere\r\nnear it in those days. But nowadays, so far as people of birth are\r\nconcerned, you have to be an Araceli to be delighted with it. He had a\r\nwhole town hanged in order to get it."\r\n\r\n"Is that the price he had to pay?" said Julien anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," answered Altamira coldly, "he probably had about thirty\r\nrich landed proprietors in his district who had the reputation of being\r\nLiberals thrown into the river."\r\n\r\n"What a monster!" pursued Julien.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole who was leaning her head forward with keenest\r\ninterest was so near him that her beautiful hair almost touched his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"You are very young," answered Altamira. "I was telling you that I had\r\na married sister in Provence. She is still pretty, good and gentle; she\r\nis an excellent mother, performs all her duties faithfully, is pious\r\nbut not a bigot."\r\n\r\n"What is he driving at?" thought mademoiselle de la Mole.\r\n\r\n"She is happy," continued the comte Altamira; "she was so in 1815. I\r\nwas then in hiding at her house on her estate near the Antibes. Well\r\nthe moment she learnt of marshall Ney\'s execution she began to dance."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?" said Julien, thunderstruck.\r\n\r\n"It\'s party spirit," replied Altamira. "There are no longer any real\r\npassions in the nineteenth century: that\'s why one is so bored in\r\nFrance. People commit acts of the greatest cruelty, but without any\r\nfeeling of cruelty."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse," said Julien, "when one does commit a crime one\r\nought at least to take pleasure in committing it; that\'s the only good\r\nthing they have about them and that\'s the only way in which they have\r\nthe slightest justification."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole had entirely forgotten what she owed to herself\r\nand placed herself completely between Altamira and Julien. Her brother,\r\nwho was giving her his arm, and was accustomed to obey her, was\r\nlooking at another part of the room, and in order to keep himself in\r\ncountenance was pretending to be stopped by the crowd.\r\n\r\n"You are right," Altamira went on, "one takes pleasure in nothing one\r\ndoes, and one does not remember it: this applies even to crimes. I can\r\nshow you perhaps ten men in this ballroom who have been convicted of\r\nmurder. They have forgotten all about it and everybody else as well."\r\n\r\n"Many are moved to the point of tears if their dog breaks a paw.\r\nWhen you throw flowers on their grave at P\xc3\xa8re-la-Chaise, as you say\r\nso humorously in Paris, we learn they united all the virtues of the\r\nknights of chivalry, and we speak about the noble feats of their\r\ngreat-grandfather who lived in the reign of Henri IV. If, in spite of\r\nthe good offices of the Prince de Araceli, I escape hanging and I ever\r\nmanage to enjoy the use of my money in Paris, I will get you to dine\r\nwith eight or ten of these respected and callous murderers.\r\n\r\n"At that dinner you and I will be the only ones whose blood is pure,\r\nbut I shall be despised and almost hated as a monster, while you will\r\nbe simply despised as a man of the people who has pushed his way into\r\ngood society."\r\n\r\n"Nothing could be truer," said mademoiselle de la Mole.\r\n\r\nAltamira looked at her in astonishment; but Julien did not deign to\r\nlook at her.\r\n\r\n"Observe that the revolution, at whose head I found myself," continued\r\nthe comte Altamira, "only failed for the one reason that I would not\r\ncut off three heads and distribute among our partisans seven or eight\r\nmillions which happened to be in a box of which I happened to have the\r\nkey. My king, who is burning to have me hanged to-day, and who called\r\nme by my christian name before the rebellion, would have given me the\r\ngreat ribbon of his order if I had had those three heads cut off and\r\nhad had the money in those boxes distributed; for I should have had at\r\nleast a semi-success and my country would have had a charta like ----.\r\nSo wags the world; it\'s a game of chess."\r\n\r\n"At that time," answered Julien with a fiery eye, "you did not know the\r\ngame; now...."\r\n\r\n"You mean I would have the heads cut off, and I would not be a\r\nGirondin, as you said I was the other day? I will give you your\r\nanswer," said Altamira sadly, "when you have killed a man in a duel--a\r\nfar less ugly matter than having him put to death by an executioner."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," said Julien, "the end justifies the means. If instead\r\nof being an insignificant man I had some power I would have three men\r\nhanged in order to save four men\'s lives."\r\n\r\nHis eyes expressed the fire of his own conscience; they met the eyes of\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole who was close by him, and their contempt, so\r\nfar from changing into politeness seemed to redouble.\r\n\r\nShe was deeply shocked; but she found herself unable to forget Julien;\r\nshe dragged her brother away and went off in a temper.\r\n\r\n"I must take some punch and dance a lot," she said to herself. "I will\r\npick out the best partner and cut some figure at any price. Good, there\r\nis that celebrated cynic, the comte de Fervaques." She accepted his\r\ninvitation; they danced. "The question is," she thought, "which of us\r\ntwo will be the more impertinent, but in order to make absolute fun\r\nof him, I must get him to talk." Soon all the other members of the\r\nquadrille were dancing as a matter of formality, they did not want to\r\nlose any of Mathilde\'s cutting reparte. M. de Fervaques felt uneasy and\r\nas he could only find elegant expressions instead of ideas, began to\r\nscowl. Mathilde, who was in a bad temper was cruel, and made an enemy\r\nof him. She danced till daylight and then went home terribly tired.\r\nBut when she was in the carriage the little vitality she had left, was\r\nstill employed in making her sad and unhappy. She had been despised by\r\nJulien and could not despise him.\r\n\r\nJulien was at the zenith of his happiness. He was enchanted without\r\nhis knowing it by the music, the flowers, the pretty women, the\r\ngeneral elegance, and above all by his own imagination which dreamt of\r\ndistinctions for himself and of liberty for all.\r\n\r\n"What a fine ball," he said to the comte. "Nothing is lacking."\r\n\r\n"Thought is lacking" answered Altamira, and his face betrayed that\r\ncontempt which is only more deadly from the very fact that a manifest\r\neffort is being made to hide it as a matter of politeness.\r\n\r\n"You are right, monsieur the comte, there isn\'t any thought at all, let\r\nalone enough to make a conspiracy."\r\n\r\n"I am here because of my name, but thought is hated in your salons.\r\nThought must not soar above the level of the point of a Vaudeville\r\ncouplet: it is then rewarded. But as for your man who thinks, if he\r\nshows energy and originality we call him a cynic. Was not that name\r\ngiven by one of your judges to Courier. You put him in prison as\r\nwell as B\xc3\xa9ranger. The priestly congregation hands over to the police\r\neveryone who is worth anything amongst you individually; and good\r\nsociety applauds.\r\n\r\n"The fact is your effete society prizes conventionalism above\r\neverything else. You will never get beyond military bravery. You will\r\nhave Murats, never Washingtons. I can see nothing in France except\r\nvanity. A man who goes on speaking on the spur of the moment may easily\r\ncome to make an imprudent witticism and the master of the house thinks\r\nhimself insulted."\r\n\r\nAs he was saying this, the carriage in which the comte was seeing\r\nJulien home stopped before the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole. Julien was in love\r\nwith his conspirator. Altamira had paid him this great compliment which\r\nwas evidently the expression of a sound conviction. "You have not got\r\nthe French flippancy and you understand the principle of _utility_."\r\nIt happened that Julien had seen the day before _Marino Faliero_, a\r\ntragedy, by Casmir Delavigne.\r\n\r\n"Has not Israel Bertuccio got more character than all those noble\r\nVenetians?" said our rebellious plebeian to himself, "and yet those\r\nare the people whose nobility goes back to the year seven hundred, a\r\ncentury before Charlemagne, while the cream of the nobility at M. de\r\nRitz\'s ball to-night only goes back, and that rather lamely, to the\r\nthirteenth century. Well, in spite of all the noble Venetians whose\r\nbirth makes so great, it is Israel Bertuccio whom one remembers.\r\n\r\n"A conspiracy annihilates all titles conferred by social caprice.\r\nThere, a man takes for his crest the rank that is given him by the way\r\nin which he faces death. The intellect itself loses some of its power.\r\n\r\n"What would Danton have been to-day in this age of the Valenods and the\r\nR\xc3\xaanals? Not even a deputy for the Public Prosecutor.\r\n\r\n"What am I saying? He would have sold himself to the priests, he\r\nwould have been a minister, for after all the great Danton did steal.\r\nMirabeau also sold himself. Napoleon stole millions in Italy, otherwise\r\nhe would have been stopped short in his career by poverty like\r\nPichegru. Only La Fayette refrained from stealing. Ought one to steal,\r\nought one to sell oneself?" thought Julien. This question pulled him up\r\nshort. He passed the rest of the night in reading the history of the\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nWhen he wrote his letters in the library the following day, his mind\r\nwas still concentrated on his conversation with count Altamira.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact," he said to himself after a long reverie, "If the\r\nSpanish Liberals had not injured their nation by crimes they would not\r\nhave been cleared out as easily as they were.\r\n\r\n"They were haughty, talkative children--just like I am!" he suddenly\r\nexclaimed as though waking up with a start.\r\n\r\n"What difficulty have I surmounted that entitles me to judge such\r\ndevils who, once alive, dared to begin to act. I am like a man who\r\nexclaims at the close of a meal, \'I won\'t dine to-morrow; but that\r\nwon\'t prevent me from feeling as strong and merry like I do to-day.\'\r\nWho knows what one feels when one is half-way through a great action?"\r\n\r\nThese lofty thoughts were disturbed by the unexpected arrival in\r\nthe library of mademoiselle de la Mole. He was so animated by his\r\nadmiration for the great qualities of such invincibles as Danton,\r\nMirabeau, and Carnot that, though he fixed his eyes on mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole, he neither gave her a thought nor bowed to her, and scarcely\r\neven saw her. When finally his big, open eyes realized her presence,\r\ntheir expression vanished. Mademoiselle de la Mole noticed it with\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that she asked him for V\xc3\xa9ly\'s History of France which\r\nwas on the highest shelf, and thus necessitated Julien going to fetch\r\nthe longer of the two ladders. Julien had brought the ladder and had\r\nfetched the volume and given it to her, but had not yet been able to\r\ngive her a single thought. As he was taking the ladder back he hit\r\nin his hurry one of the glass panes in the library with his elbow;\r\nthe noise of the glass falling on the floor finally brought him to\r\nhimself. He hastened to apologise to mademoiselle de la Mole. He tried\r\nto be polite and was certainly nothing more. Mathilde saw clearly that\r\nshe had disturbed him, and that he would have preferred to have gone\r\non thinking about what he had been engrossed in before her arrival,\r\nto speaking to her. After looking at him for some time she went\r\nslowly away. Julien watched her walk. He enjoyed the contrast of her\r\npresent dress with the elegant magnificence of the previous night. The\r\ndifference between the two expressions was equally striking. The young\r\ngirl who had been so haughty at the Duke de Retz\'s ball, had, at the\r\npresent moment, an almost plaintive expression. "As a matter of fact,"\r\nsaid Julien to himself, "that black dress makes the beauty of her\r\nfigure all the more striking. She has a queenly carriage; but why is\r\nshe in mourning?"\r\n\r\n"If I ask someone the reason for this mourning, they will think I am\r\nputting my foot in it again." Julien had now quite emerged from the\r\ndepth of his enthusiasm. "I must read over again all the letters I have\r\nwritten this morning. God knows how many missed out words and blunders\r\nI shall find. As he was forcing himself to concentrate his mind on the\r\nfirst of these letters he heard the rustle of a silk dress near him.\r\nHe suddenly turned round, mademoiselle de la Mole was two yards from\r\nhis table, she was smiling. This second interruption put Julien into a\r\nbad temper. Mathilde had just fully realized that she meant nothing to\r\nthis young man. Her smile was intended to hide her embarrassment; she\r\nsucceeded in doing so.\r\n\r\n"You are evidently thinking of something very interesting, Monsieur\r\nSorel. Is it not some curious anecdote about that conspiracy which\r\nis responsible for comte Altamira being in Paris? Tell me what it is\r\nabout, I am burning to know. I will be discreet, I swear it." She was\r\nastonished at hearing herself utter these words. What! was she asking a\r\nfavour of an inferior! Her embarrassment increased, and she added with\r\na little touch of flippancy,\r\n\r\n"What has managed to turn such a usually cold person as yourself, into\r\nan inspired being, a kind of Michael Angelo prophet?"\r\n\r\nThis sharp and indiscreet question wounded Julien deeply, and rendered\r\nhim madder than ever.\r\n\r\n"Was Danton right in stealing?" he said to her brusquely in a manner\r\nthat grew more and more surly. "Ought the revolutionaries of Piedmont\r\nand of Spain to have injured the people by crimes? To have given all\r\nthe places in the army and all the orders to undeserving persons? Would\r\nnot the persons who wore these orders have feared the return of the\r\nking? Ought they to have allowed the treasure of Turin to be looted?\r\nIn a word, mademoiselle," he said, coming near her with a terrifying\r\nexpression, "ought the man who wishes to chase ignorance and crime from\r\nthe world to pass like the whirlwind and do evil indiscriminately?"\r\n\r\nMathilde felt frightened, was unable to stand his look, and retreated a\r\ncouples of paces. She looked at him a moment, and then ashamed of her\r\nown fear, left the library with a light step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGUERITE\r\n\r\n\r\n        Love! In what madness do you not manage to make us find\r\n        pleasure!\r\n                                      Letters of a Portuguese Nun.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien reread his letters. "How ridiculous I must have appeared in the\r\neyes of that Parisian doll," he said to himself when the dinner-bell\r\nrang. "How foolish to have really told her what I was thinking! Perhaps\r\nit was not so foolish. Telling the truth on that occasion was worthy of\r\nme. Why did she come to question me on personal matters? That question\r\nwas indiscreet on her part. She broke the convention. My thoughts about\r\nDanton are not part of the sacrifice which her father pays me to make."\r\n\r\nWhen he came into the dining-room Julien\'s thoughts were distracted\r\nfrom his bad temper by mademoiselle de la Mole\'s mourning which was all\r\nthe more striking because none of the other members of the family were\r\nin black.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he felt completely rid of the feeling which had obsessed\r\nhim all day. Fortunately the academician who knew Latin was at dinner.\r\n"That\'s the man who will make the least fun of me," said Julien to\r\nhimself, "if, as I surmise, my question about mademoiselle de la Mole\'s\r\nmourning is in bad taste."\r\n\r\nMathilde was looking at him with a singular expression. "So this is the\r\ncoquetry of the women of this part of the country, just as madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal described it to me," said Julien to himself. "I was not nice to\r\nher this morning. I did not humour her caprice of talking to me. I got\r\nup in value in her eyes. The Devil doubtless is no loser by it.\r\n\r\n"Later on her haughty disdain will manage to revenge herself. I defy\r\nher to do her worst. What a contrast with what I have lost! What\r\ncharming naturalness? What naivety! I used to know her thoughts before\r\nshe did herself. I used to see them come into existence. The only rival\r\nshe had in her heart was the fear of her childrens\' death. It was a\r\nreasonable, natural feeling to me, and even though I suffered from it I\r\nfound it charming. I have been a fool. The ideas I had in my head about\r\nParis prevented me from appreciating that sublime woman.\r\n\r\n"Great God what a contrast and what do I find here? Arid, haughty\r\nvanity: all the fine shades of wounded egotism and nothing more."\r\n\r\nThey got up from table. "I must not let my academician get snapped up,"\r\nsaid Julien to himself. He went up to him as they were passing into the\r\ngarden, assumed an air of soft submissiveness and shared in his fury\r\nagainst the success of Hernani.\r\n\r\n"If only we were still in the days of _lettres de cachet_!" he said.\r\n\r\n"Then he would not have dared," exclaimed the academician with a\r\ngesture worthy of Talma.\r\n\r\nJulien quoted some words from Virgil\'s Georgics in reference to a\r\nflower and expressed the opinion that nothing was equal to the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nDelille\'s verses. In a word he flattered the academician in every\r\npossible way. He then said to him with the utmost indifference, "I\r\nsuppose mademoiselle de la Mole has inherited something from some uncle\r\nfor whom she is in mourning."\r\n\r\n"What! you belong to the house?" said the academician stopping short,\r\n"and you do not know her folly? As a matter of fact it is strange her\r\nmother should allow her to do such things, but between ourselves, they\r\ndo not shine in this household exactly by their force of character.\r\nMademoiselle\'s share has to do for all of them, and governs them.\r\nTo-day is the thirtieth of April!" and the academician stopped and\r\nlooked meaningly at Julien. Julien smiled with the most knowing\r\nexpression he could master. "What connection can there be between\r\nruling a household, wearing a black dress, and the thirtieth April?" he\r\nsaid to himself. "I must be even sillier than I thought."\r\n\r\n"I must confess...." he said to the academician while he continued to\r\nquestion him with his look. "Let us take a turn round the garden,"\r\nsaid the academician delighted at seeing an opportunity of telling a\r\nlong and well-turned story.\r\n\r\n"What! is it really possible you do not know what happened on the 30th\r\nApril, 1574?"\r\n\r\n"And where?" said Julien in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"At the place de Gr\xc3\xa8ve."\r\n\r\nJulien was extremely astonished that these words did not supply him\r\nwith the key. His curiosity and his expectation of a tragic interest\r\nwhich would be in such harmony with his own character gave his eyes\r\nthat brilliance which the teller of a story likes to see so much in\r\nthe person who is listening to him. The academician was delighted at\r\nfinding a virgin ear, and narrated at length to Julien how Boniface de\r\nla Mole, the handsomest young man of this century together with Annibal\r\nde Coconasso, his friend, a gentleman of Piedmont, had been beheaded on\r\nthe 30th April, 1574. La Mole was the adored lover of Queen Marguerite\r\nof Navarre and "observe," continued the academician, "that mademoiselle\r\nde La Mole\'s full name is Mathilde Marguerite. La Mole was at the same\r\ntime a favourite of the Duke d\'Alen\xc3\xa7on and the intimate friend of\r\nhis mistress\'s husband, the King of Navarre, subsequently Henri IV.\r\nOn Shrove Tuesday of that year 1574, the court happened to be at St.\r\nGermain with the poor king Charles IX. who was dying. La Mole wished\r\nto rescue his friends the princes, whom Queen Catherine of Medici was\r\nkeeping prisoner in her Court. He advanced two hundred cavalry under\r\nthe walls of St. Germain; the Duke d\'Alen\xc3\xa7on was frightened and La Mole\r\nwas thrown to the executioner.\r\n\r\n"But the thing which affects mademoiselle Mathilde, and what she has\r\nadmitted to me herself seven or eight years ago when she was twelve,\r\nis a head! a head!----and the academician lifted up his eyes to the\r\nheavens. What struck her in this political catastrophe, was the hiding\r\nof Queen Marguerite de Navarre in a house in the place de Gr\xc3\xa8ve and\r\nher then asking for her lover\'s head. At midnight on the following day\r\nshe took that head in her carriage and went and buried it herself in a\r\nchapel at the foot of the hill at Montmartre."\r\n\r\n"Impossible?" cried Julien really moved.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle Mathilde despises her brother because, as you see, he\r\ndoes not bother one whit about this ancient history, and never wears\r\nmourning on the thirtieth of April. It is since the time of this\r\ncelebrated execution and in order to recall the intimate friendship\r\nof La Mole for the said Coconasso, who Italian that he was, bore\r\nthe name of Annibal that all the men of that family bear that name.\r\nAnd," added the academician lowering his voice, "this Coconasso was,\r\naccording to Charles IX. himself, one of the cruellest assassins of the\r\ntwenty-fourth August, 1572. But how is it possible, my dear Sorel, that\r\nyou should be ignorant of these things--you who take your meals with\r\nthe family."\r\n\r\n"So that is why mademoiselle de la Mole twice called her brother\r\nAnnibal at dinner. I thought I had heard wrong."\r\n\r\n"It was a reproach. It is strange that the marquise should allow such\r\nfollies. The husband of that great girl will have a fine time of it."\r\n\r\nThis remark was followed by five or six satiric phrases. Julien was\r\nshocked by the joy which shone in the academician\'s eyes. "We are just\r\na couple of servants," he thought, "engaged in talking scandal about\r\nour masters. But I ought not to be astonished at anything this academy\r\nman does."\r\n\r\nJulien had surprised him on his knees one day before the marquise de\r\nla Mole; he was asking her for a tobacco receivership for a nephew in\r\nthe provinces. In the evening a little chambermaid of mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole, who was paying court to Julien, just as Elisa had used to do,\r\ngave him to understand that her mistress\'s mourning was very far from\r\nbeing worn simply to attract attention. This eccentricity was rooted in\r\nher character. She really loved that la Mole, the beloved lover of the\r\nmost witty queen of the century, who had died through trying to set his\r\nfriends at liberty--and what friends! The first prince of the blood and\r\nHenri IV.\r\n\r\nAccustomed as he had been to the perfect naturalness which shone\r\nthroughout madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s whole demeanour, Julien could not help\r\nfinding all the women of Paris affected, and, though by no means of a\r\nmorose disposition, found nothing to say to them. Mademoiselle de la\r\nMole was an exception.\r\n\r\nHe now began to cease taking for coldness of heart that kind of beauty\r\nwhich attaches importance to a noble bearing. He had long conversations\r\nwith mademoiselle de la Mole, who would sometimes walk with him in\r\nthe garden after dinner. She told him one day that she was reading\r\nthe History of D\'Aubign\xc3\xa9 and also Brant\xc3\xb4me. "Strange books to read,"\r\nthought Julien; "and the marquis does not allow her to read Walter\r\nScott\'s novels!"\r\n\r\nShe told him one day, with that pleased brilliancy in her eyes, which\r\nis the real test of genuine admiration, about a characteristic act of a\r\nyoung woman of the reign of Henry III., which she had just read in the\r\nmemoirs of L\'\xc3\x89toile. Finding her husband unfaithful she stabbed him.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s vanity was nattered. A person who was surrounded by so much\r\nhomage, and who governed the whole house, according to the academician,\r\ndeigned to talk to him on a footing almost resembling friendship.\r\n\r\n"I made a mistake," thought Julien soon afterwards. "This is not\r\nfamiliarity, I am simply the confidante of a tragedy, she needs to\r\nspeak to someone. I pass in this family for a man of learning. I will\r\ngo and read Brant\xc3\xb4me, D\'Aubign\xc3\xa9, L\'\xc3\x89toile. I shall then be able to\r\nchallenge some of the anecdotes which madame de la Mole speaks to me\r\nabout. I want to leave off this r\xc3\xb4le of the passive confidant\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\nHis conversations with this young girl, whose demeanour was so\r\nimpressive and yet so easy, gradually became more interesting. He\r\nforgot his grim r\xc3\xb4le of the rebel plebian. He found her well-informed\r\nand even logical. Her opinions in the gardens were very different to\r\nthose which she owned to in the salon. Sometimes she exhibited an\r\nenthusiasm and a frankness which were in absolute contrast to her usual\r\ncold haughtiness.\r\n\r\n"The wars of the League were the heroic days of France," she said\r\nto him one day, with eyes shining with enthusiasm. "Then everyone\r\nfought to gain something which he desired, for the sake of his party\'s\r\ntriumph, and not just in order to win a cross as in the days of your\r\nemperor. Admit that there was then less egotism and less pettiness. I\r\nlove that century."\r\n\r\n"And Boniface de la Mole was the hero of it," he said to her.\r\n\r\n"At least he was loved in a way that it is perhaps sweet to be loved.\r\nWhat woman alive now would not be horrified at touching the head of her\r\ndecapitated lover?"\r\n\r\nMadame de la Mole called her daughter. To be effective hypocrisy\r\nought to hide itself, yet Julien had half confided his admiration for\r\nNapoleon to mademoiselle de la Mole.\r\n\r\nJulien remained alone in the garden. "That is the immense advantage\r\nthey have over us," he said to himself. "Their ancestors lift them\r\nabove vulgar sentiments, and they have not got always to be thinking\r\nabout their subsistence! What misery," he added bitterly. "I am not\r\nworthy to discuss these great matters. My life is nothing more than a\r\nseries of hypocrisies because I have not got a thousand francs a year\r\nwith which to buy my bread and butter."\r\n\r\nMathilde came running back. "What are you dreaming about, monsieur?"\r\nshe said to him.\r\n\r\nJulien was tired of despising himself. Through sheer pride he frankly\r\ntold her his thoughts. He blushed a great deal while talking to such\r\na person about his own poverty. He tried to make it as plain as he\r\ncould that he was not asking for anything. Mathilde never thought\r\nhim so handsome; she detected in him an expression of frankness and\r\nsensitiveness which he often lacked.\r\n\r\nWithin a month of this episode Julien was pensively walking in the\r\ngarden of the h\xc3\xb4tel; but his face had no longer the hardness and\r\nphilosophic superciliousness which the chronic consciousness of his\r\ninferior position had used to write upon it. He had just escorted\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole to the door of the salon. She said she had hurt\r\nher foot while running with her brother.\r\n\r\n"She leaned on my arm in a very singular way," said Julien to himself.\r\n"Am I a coxcomb, or is it true that she has taken a fancy to me? She\r\nlistens to me so gently, even when I confess to her all the sufferings\r\nof my pride! She too, who is so haughty to everyone! They would be\r\nvery astonished in the salon if they saw that expression of hers. It\r\nis quite certain that she does not show anyone else such sweetness and\r\ngoodness."\r\n\r\nJulien endeavoured not to exaggerate this singular friendship. He\r\nhimself compared it to an armed truce. When they met again each day,\r\nthey almost seemed before they took up the almost intimate tone of the\r\nprevious day to ask themselves "are we going to be friends or enemies\r\nto-day?" Julien had realised that to allow himself to be insulted\r\nwith impunity even once by this haughty girl would mean the loss of\r\neverything. "If I have got to quarrel would it not be better that it\r\nshould be straight away in defending the rights of my own pride,\r\nthan in parrying the expressions of contempt which would follow the\r\nslightest abandonment of my duty to my own self-respect?"\r\n\r\nOn many occasions, on days when she was in a bad temper Mathilde, tried\r\nto play the great lady with him. These attempts were extremely subtle,\r\nbut Julien rebuffed them roughly.\r\n\r\nOne day he brusquely interrupted her. "Has mademoiselle de la Mole any\r\norders to give her father\'s secretary?" he said to her. "If so he must\r\nlisten to her orders, and execute them, but apart from that he has not\r\na single word to say to her. He is not paid to tell her his thoughts."\r\n\r\nThis kind of life, together with the singular surmises which it\r\noccasioned, dissipated the boredom which he had been accustomed to\r\nexperience in that magnificent salon, where everyone was afraid, and\r\nwhere any kind of jest was in bad form.\r\n\r\n"It would be humorous if she loved me but whether she loves me or\r\nnot," went on Julien, "I have for my confidential friend a girl of\r\nspirit before whom I see the whole household quake, while the marquis\r\nde Croisenois does so more than anyone else. Yes, to be sure, that\r\nsame young man who is so polite, so gentle, and so brave, and who has\r\ncombined all those advantages of birth and fortune a single one of\r\nwhich would put my heart at rest--he is madly in love with her, he\r\nought to marry her. How many letters has M. de la Mole made me write\r\nto the two notaries in order to arrange the contract? And I, though I\r\nam an absolute inferior when I have my pen in my hand, why, I triumph\r\nover that young man two hours afterwards in this very garden; for,\r\nafter all, her preference is striking and direct. Perhaps she hates\r\nhim because she sees in him a future husband. She is haughty enough\r\nfor that. As for her kindness to me, I receive it in my capacity of\r\nconfidential servant.\r\n\r\n"But no, I am either mad or she is making advances to me; the colder\r\nand more respectful I show myself to her, the more she runs after me.\r\nIt may be a deliberate piece of affectation; but I see her eyes become\r\nanimated when I appear unexpectedly. Can the women of Paris manage to\r\nact to such an extent. What does it matter to me! I have appearances in\r\nmy favour, let us enjoy appearances. Heavens, how beautiful she is!\r\nHow I like her great blue eyes when I see them at close quarters, and\r\nthey look at me in the way they often do? What a difference between\r\nthis spring and that of last year, when I lived an unhappy life among\r\nthree hundred dirty malicious hypocrites, and only kept myself afloat\r\nthrough sheer force of character, I was almost as malicious as they\r\nwere."\r\n\r\n"That young girl is making fun of me," Julien would think in his\r\nsuspicious days. "She is acting in concert with her brother to make\r\na fool of me. But she seems to have an absolute contempt for her\r\nbrother\'s lack of energy. He is brave and that is all. He has not a\r\nthought which dares to deviate from the conventional. It is always\r\nI who have to take up the cudgels in his defence. A young girl of\r\nnineteen! Can one at that age act up faithfully every second of the\r\nday to the part which one has determined to play. On the other hand\r\nwhenever mademoiselle de la Mole fixes her eyes on me with a singular\r\nexpression comte Norbert always goes away. I think that suspicious.\r\nOught he not to be indignant at his sister singling out a servant of\r\nher household? For that is how I heard the Duke de Chaulnes speak about\r\nme. This recollection caused anger to supersede every other emotion. It\r\nis simply a fashion for old fashioned phraseology on the part of the\r\neccentric duke?"\r\n\r\n"Well, she is pretty!" continued Julien with a tigerish expression, "I\r\nwill have her, I will then go away, and woe to him who disturbs me in\r\nmy flight."\r\n\r\nThis idea became Julien\'s sole preoccupation. He could not think of\r\nanything else. His days passed like hours.\r\n\r\nEvery moment when he tried to concentrate on some important matter\r\nhis mind became a blank, and he would wake up a quarter of an hour\r\nafterwards with a beating heart and an anxious mind, brooding over this\r\nidea "does she love me?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nA YOUNG GIRL\'S DOMINION\r\n\r\n\r\n        I admire her beauty but I fear her intellect.--_M\xc3\xa9rim\xc3\xa9e_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Julien had employed the time which he spent in exaggerating\r\nMatilde\'s beauty or in working himself up into a rage against that\r\nfamily haughtiness which she was forgetting for his sake in examining\r\nwhat was going on in the salon, he would have understood the secret of\r\nher dominion over all that surrounded her.\r\n\r\nWhen anyone displeased mademoiselle de La Mole she managed to punish\r\nthe offender by a jest which was so guarded, so well chosen, so polite\r\nand so neatly timed, that the more the victim thought about it, the\r\nsorer grew the wound. She gradually became positively terrible to\r\nwounded vanity. As she attached no value to many things which the\r\nrest of her family very seriously wanted, she always struck them as\r\nself-possessed. The salons of the aristocracy are nice enough to brag\r\nabout when you leave them, but that is all; mere politeness alone only\r\ncounts for something in its own right during the first few days. Julien\r\nexperienced this after the first fascination and the first astonishment\r\nhad passed off. "Politeness," he said to himself "is nothing but the\r\nabsence of that bad temper which would be occasioned by bad manners."\r\nMathilde was frequently bored; perhaps she would have been bored\r\nanywhere. She then found a real distraction and real pleasure in\r\nsharpening an epigram.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps in order to have more amusing victims than her great\r\nrelations, the academician and the five or six other men of inferior\r\nclass who paid her court, that she had given encouragement to the\r\nmarquis de Croisenois, the comte Caylus and two or three other young\r\nmen of the highest rank. They simply represented new subjects for\r\nepigrams.\r\n\r\nWe will admit with reluctance, for we are fond of Mathilde, that she\r\nhad received many letters from several of them and had sometimes\r\nanswered them. We hasten to add that this person constitutes an\r\nexception to the manners of the century. Lack of prudence is not\r\ngenerally the fault with which the pupils of the noble convent of the\r\nSacred Heart can be reproached.\r\n\r\nOne day the marquis de Croisenois returned to Mathilde a fairly\r\ncompromising letter which she had written the previous night. He\r\nthought that he was thereby advancing his cause a great deal by taking\r\nthis highly prudent step. But the very imprudence of her correspondence\r\nwas the very element in it Mathilde liked. Her pleasure was to stake\r\nher fate. She did not speak to him again for six weeks.\r\n\r\nShe amused herself with the letters of these young men, but in her view\r\nthey were all like each other. It was invariably a case of the most\r\nprofound, the most melancholy, passion.\r\n\r\n"They all represent the same perfect man, ready to leave for\r\nPalestine," she exclaimed to her cousin. "Can you conceive of anything\r\nmore insipid? So these are the letters I am going to receive all my\r\nlife! There can only be a change every twenty years according to the\r\nkind of vogue which happens to be fashionable. They must have had more\r\ncolour in them in the days of the Empire. In those days all these young\r\nsociety men had seen or accomplished feats which really had an element\r\nof greatness. The Duke of N---- my uncle was at Wagram."\r\n\r\n"What brains do you need to deal a sabre blow? And when they have had\r\nthe luck to do that they talk of it so often!" said mademoiselle de\r\nSainte-H\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9dit\xc3\xa9, Mathilde\'s cousin.\r\n\r\n"Well, those tales give me pleasure. Being in a real battle, a battle\r\nof Napoleon, where six thousand soldiers were killed, why, that\'s proof\r\nof courage. Exposing one\'s self to danger elevates the soul and saves\r\nit from the boredom in which my poor admirers seem to be sunk; and that\r\nboredom is contagious. Which of them ever thought of doing anything\r\nextraordinary? They are trying to win my hand, a pretty business to\r\nbe sure! I am rich and my father will procure advancement for his\r\nson-in-law. Well! I hope he\'ll manage to find someone who is a little\r\nbit amusing."\r\n\r\nMathilde\'s keen, sharp and picturesque view of life spoilt her language\r\nas one sees. An expression of hers would often constitute a blemish\r\nin the eyes of her polished friends. If she had been less fashionable\r\nthey would almost have owned that her manner of speaking was, from the\r\nstandpoint of feminine delicacy, to some extent unduly coloured.\r\n\r\nShe, on her side, was very unjust towards the handsome cavaliers who\r\nfill the Bois de Boulogne. She envisaged the future not with terror,\r\nthat would have been a vivid emotion, but with a disgust which was very\r\nrare at her age.\r\n\r\nWhat could she desire? Fortune, good birth, wit, beauty, according to\r\nwhat the world said, and according to what she believed, all these\r\nthings had been lavished upon her by the hands of chance.\r\n\r\nSo this was the state of mind of the most envied heiress of the\r\nfaubourg Saint-Germain when she began to find pleasure in walking with\r\nJulien. She was astonished at his pride; she admired the ability of the\r\nlittle bourgeois. "He will manage to get made a bishop like the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nMouray," she said to herself.\r\n\r\nSoon the sincere and unaffected opposition with which our hero received\r\nseveral of her ideas filled her mind; she continued to think about\r\nit, she told her friend the slightest details of the conversation,\r\nbut thought that she would never succeed in fully rendering all their\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nAn idea suddenly flashed across her; "I have the happiness of loving,"\r\nshe said to herself one day with an incredible ecstasy of joy. "I am in\r\nlove, I am in love, it is clear! Where can a young, witty and beautiful\r\ngirl of my own age find sensations if not in love? It is no good. I\r\nshall never feel any love for Croisenois, Caylus, and _tutti quanti_.\r\nThey are unimpeachable, perhaps too unimpeachable; any way they bore\r\nme."\r\n\r\nShe rehearsed in her mind all the descriptions of passion which she\r\nhad read in _Manon Lescaut_, the _Nouvelle H\xc3\xa9loise_, the _Letters of\r\na Portuguese Nun_, etc., etc. It was only a question of course of the\r\ngrand passion; light love was unworthy of a girl of her age and birth.\r\nShe vouchsafed the name of love to that heroic sentiment which was met\r\nwith in France in the time of Henri III. and Bassompierre. That love\r\ndid not basely yield to obstacles, but, far from it, inspired great\r\ndeeds. "How unfortunate for me that there is not a real court like that\r\nof Catherine de\' Medici or of Louis XIII. I feel equal to the boldest\r\nand greatest actions. What would I not make of a king who was a man of\r\nspirit like Louis XIII. if he were sighing at my feet! I would take\r\nhim to the Vend\xc3\xa9e, as the Baron de Tolly is so fond of saying, and\r\nfrom that base he would re-conquer his kingdom; then no more about a\r\ncharter--and Julien would help me. What does he lack? name and fortune.\r\nHe will make a name, he will win a fortune.\r\n\r\n"Croisenois lacks nothing, and he will never be anything else all his\r\nlife but a duke who is half \'ultra\' and half Liberal, an undecided\r\nbeing who never goes to extremes and consequently always plays second\r\nfiddle.\r\n\r\n"What great action is not an extreme at the moment when it is\r\nundertaken? It is only after accomplishment that it seems possible to\r\ncommonplace individuals. Yes, it is love with all its miracles which\r\nis going to reign over my heart; I feel as much from the fire which is\r\nthrilling me. Heaven owed me this boon. It will not then have lavished\r\nin vain all its bounties on one single person. My happiness will be\r\nworthy of me. Each day will no longer be the cold replica of the day\r\nbefore. There is grandeur and audacity in the very fact of daring to\r\nlove a man, placed so far beneath me by his social position. Let us see\r\nwhat happens, will he continue to deserve me? I will abandon him at the\r\nfirst sign of weakness which I detect. A girl of my birth and of that\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val temperament which they are good enough to ascribe to me (she\r\nwas quoting from her father) must not behave like a fool.\r\n\r\n"But should I not be behaving like a fool if I were to love the marquis\r\nde Croisenois? I should simply have a new edition over again of that\r\nhappiness enjoyed by my girl cousins which I so utterly despise. I\r\nalready know everything the poor marquis would say to me and every\r\nanswer I should make. What\'s the good of a love which makes one\r\nyawn? One might as well be in a nunnery. I shall have a celebration\r\nof the signing of a contract just like my younger cousin when the\r\ngrandparents all break down, provided of course that they are not\r\nannoyed by some condition introduced into the contract at the eleventh\r\nhour by the notary on the other side."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nIS HE A DANTON?\r\n\r\n\r\n        The need of anxiety. These words summed up the character\r\n        of my aunt, the beautiful Marguerite de Valois, who was\r\n        soon to marry the King of Navarre whom we see reigning\r\n        at present in France under the name of Henry IV. The\r\n        need of staking something was the key to the character\r\n        of this charming princess; hence her quarrels and\r\n        reconciliations with her brothers from the time when she\r\n        was sixteen. Now, what can a young girl stake? The most\r\n        precious thing she has: her reputation, the esteem of a\r\n        lifetime.\r\n                        _Memoirs of the Duke d\' Angoul\xc3\xa8me._\r\n                        _the natural son of Charles IX_.\r\n\r\n\r\n"There is no contract to sign for Julien and me, there is no notary;\r\neverything is on the heroic plane, everything is the child of chance.\r\nApart from the noble birth which he lacks, it is the love of Marguerite\r\nde Valois for the young La Mole, the most distinguished man of the\r\ntime, over again. Is it my fault that the young men of the court are\r\nsuch great advocates of the conventional, and turn pale at the mere\r\nidea of the slightest adventure which is a little out of the ordinary?\r\nA little journey in Greece or Africa represents the highest pitch of\r\ntheir audacity, and moreover they can only march in troops. As soon as\r\nthey find themselves alone they are frightened, not of the Bedouin\'s\r\nlance, but of ridicule and that fear makes them mad.\r\n\r\n"My little Julien on the other hand only likes to act alone. This\r\nunique person never thinks for a minute of seeking help or support in\r\nothers! He despises others, and that is why I do not despise him.\r\n\r\n"If Julien were noble as well as poor, my love would simply be a vulgar\r\npiece of stupidity, a sheer m\xc3\xa9salliance; I would have nothing to do\r\nwith it; it would be absolutely devoid of the characteristic traits of\r\ngrand passion--the immensity of the difficulty to be overcome and the\r\nblack uncertainty cf the result."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole was so engrossed in these pretty arguments that\r\nwithout realising what she was doing, she praised Julien to the marquis\r\nde Croisenois and her brother on the following day. Her eloquence went\r\nso far that it provoked them.\r\n\r\n"You be careful of this young man who has so much energy," exclaimed\r\nher brother; "if we have another revolution he will have us all\r\nguillotined."\r\n\r\nShe was careful not to answer, but hastened to rally her brother and\r\nthe marquis de Croisenois on the apprehension which energy caused them.\r\n"It is at bottom simply the fear of meeting the unexpected, the fear of\r\nbeing non-plussed in the presence of the unexpected--"\r\n\r\n"Always, always, gentlemen, the fear of ridicule, a monster which had\r\nthe misfortune to die in 1816."\r\n\r\n"Ridicule has ceased to exist in a country where there are two\r\nparties," M. de la Mole was fond of saying.\r\n\r\nHis daughter had understood the idea.\r\n\r\n"So, gentlemen," she would say to Julien\'s enemies, "you will be\r\nfrightened all your life and you will be told afterwards,\r\n\r\n          "Ce n\'\xc3\xa9tait pas un loup, ce n\'en \xc3\xa9tait que l\'ombre."\r\n\r\nMatilde soon left them. Her brother\'s words horrified her; they\r\noccasioned her much anxiety, but the day afterwards she regarded them\r\nas tantamount to the highest praise.\r\n\r\n"His energy frightens them in this age where all energy is dead. I will\r\ntell him my brother\'s phrase. I want to see what answer he will make.\r\nBut I will choose one of the moments when his eyes are shining. Then he\r\nwill not be able to lie to me.\r\n\r\n"He must be a Danton!" she added after a long and vague reverie. "Well,\r\nsuppose the revolution begins again, what figures will Croisenois and\r\nmy brother cut then? It is settled in advance: Sublime resignation.\r\nThey will be heroic sheep who will allow their throats to be cut\r\nwithout saying a word. Their one fear when they die will still be the\r\nfear of being bad form. If a Jacobin came to arrest my little Julien he\r\nwould blow his brains out, however small a chance he had of escaping.\r\nHe is not frightened of doing anything in bad form."\r\n\r\nThese last words made her pensive; they recalled painful memories and\r\ndeprived her of all her boldness. These words reminded her of the jests\r\nof MM. de Caylus, Croisenois, de Luz and her brother; these gentlemen\r\njoined in censuring Julien for his priestly demeanour, which they said\r\nwas humble and hypocritical.\r\n\r\n"But," she went on suddenly with her eyes gleaming with joy, "the very\r\nbitterness and the very frequency of their jests prove in spite of\r\nthemselves that he is the most distinguished man whom we have seen this\r\nwinter. What matter his defects and the things which they make fun of?\r\nHe has the element of greatness and they are shocked by it. Yes, they,\r\nthe very men who are so good and so charitable in other matters. It is\r\na fact that he is poor and that he has studied in order to be a priest;\r\nthey are the heads of a squadron and never had any need of studying;\r\nthey found it less trouble.\r\n\r\n"In spite of all the handicap of his everlasting black suit and of that\r\npriestly expression which he must wear, poor boy, if he isn\'t to die of\r\nhunger, his merit frightens them, nothing could be clearer. And as for\r\nthat priest-like expression, why he no longer has it after we have been\r\nalone for some moments, and after those gentlemen have evolved what\r\nthey imagine to be a subtle and impromptu epigram, is not their first\r\nlook towards Julien? I have often noticed it. And yet they know well\r\nthat he never speaks to them unless he is questioned. I am the only one\r\nwhom he speaks to. He thinks I have a lofty soul. He only answers the\r\npoints they raise sufficiently to be polite. He immediately reverts\r\ninto respectfulness. But with me he will discuss things for whole\r\nhours, he is not certain of his ideas so long as I find the slightest\r\nobjection to them. There has not been a single rifle-shot fired all\r\nthis winter; words have been the only means of attracting attention.\r\nWell, my father, who is a superior man and will carry the fortunes of\r\nour house very far, respects Julien. Every one else hates him, no one\r\ndespises him except my mother\'s devout friends."\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Caylus had or pretended to have a great passion for\r\nhorses; he passed his life in his stables and often breakfasted there.\r\nThis great passion, together with his habit of never laughing, won for\r\nhim much respect among his friends: he was the eagle of the little\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had reassembled the following day behind madame de la\r\nMole\'s armchair, M. de Caylus, supported by Croisenois and by Norbert,\r\nbegan in Julien\'s absence to attack sharply the high opinion which\r\nMathilde entertained for Julien. He did this without any provocation,\r\nand almost the very minute that he caught sight of mademoiselle de la\r\nMole. She tumbled to the subtlety immediately and was delighted with it.\r\n\r\n"So there they are all leagued together," she said to herself, "against\r\na man of genius who has not ten louis a year to bless himself with and\r\nwho cannot answer them except in so far as he is questioned. They are\r\nfrightened of him, black coat and all. But how would things stand if he\r\nhad epaulettes?"\r\n\r\nShe had never been more brilliant, hardly had Caylus and his allies\r\nopened their attack than she riddled them with sarcastic jests. When\r\nthe fire of these brilliant officers was at length extinguished she\r\nsaid to M. de Caylus,\r\n\r\n"Suppose that some gentleman in the Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9 mountains finds out\r\nto-morrow that Julien is his natural son and gives him a name and\r\nsome thousands of francs, why in six months he will be an officer of\r\nhussars like you, gentlemen, in six weeks he will have moustaches like\r\nyou gentlemen. And then his greatness of character will no longer be\r\nan object of ridicule. I shall then see you reduced, monsieur the\r\nfuture duke, to this stale and bad argument, the superiority of the\r\ncourt nobility over the provincial nobility. But where will you be\r\nif I choose to push you to extremities and am mischievous enough to\r\nmake Julien\'s father a Spanish duke, who was a prisoner of war at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on in the time of Napoleon, and who out of conscientious scruples\r\nacknowledges him on his death bed?" MM. de Caylus, and de Croisenois\r\nfound all these assumptions of illegitimacy in rather bad taste. That\r\nwas all they saw in Mathilde\'s reasoning.\r\n\r\nHis sister\'s words were so clear that Norbert, in spite of his\r\nsubmissiveness, assumed a solemn air, which one must admit did not\r\nharmonise very well with his amiable, smiling face. He ventured to say\r\na few words.\r\n\r\n"Are you ill? my dear," answered Mathilde with a little air of\r\nseriousness. "You must be very bad to answer jests by moralizing."\r\n\r\n"Moralizing from you! Are you soliciting a job as prefect?"\r\n\r\nMathilde soon forgot the irritation of the comte de Caylus, the bad\r\ntemper of Norbert, and the taciturn despair of M. de Croisenois. She\r\nhad to decide one way or the other a fatal question which had just\r\nseized upon her soul.\r\n\r\n"Julien is sincere enough with me," she said to herself, "a man at\r\nhis age, in a inferior position, and rendered unhappy as he is by an\r\nextraordinary ambition, must have need of a woman friend. I am perhaps\r\nthat friend, but I see no sign of love in him. Taking into account the\r\naudacity of his character he would surely have spoken to me about his\r\nlove."\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty and this discussion with herself which henceforth\r\nmonopolised Mathilde\'s time, and in connection with which she found new\r\narguments each time that Julien spoke to her, completely routed those\r\nfits of boredom to which she had been so liable.\r\n\r\nDaughter as she was of a man of intellect who might become a minister,\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole had been when in the convent of the Sacred\r\nHeart, the object of the most excessive flattery. This misfortune can\r\nnever be compensated for. She had been persuaded that by reason of all\r\nher advantages of birth, fortune, etc., she ought to be happier than\r\nany one else. This is the cause of the boredom of princes and of all\r\ntheir follies.\r\n\r\nMathilde had not escaped the deadly influence of this idea. However\r\nintelligent one may be, one cannot at the age of ten be on one\'s guard\r\nagainst the flatteries of a whole convent, which are apparently so well\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that she had decided that she loved Julien, she\r\nwas no longer bored. She congratulated herself every day on having\r\ndeliberately decided to indulge in a grand passion. "This amusement\r\nis very dangerous," she thought. "All the better, all the better, a\r\nthousand times. Without a grand passion I should be languishing in\r\nboredom during the finest time of my life, the years from sixteen\r\nto twenty. I have already wasted my finest years: all my pleasure\r\nconsisted in being obliged to listen to the silly arguments of my\r\nmother\'s friends who when at Coblentz in 1792 were not quite so strict,\r\nso they say, as their words of to-day."\r\n\r\nIt was while Mathilde was a prey to these great fits of uncertainty\r\nthat Julien was baffled by those long looks of hers which lingered upon\r\nhim. He noticed, no doubt, an increased frigidity in the manner of\r\ncomte Norbert, and a fresh touch of haughtiness in the manner of MM. de\r\nCaylus, de Luz and de Croisenois. He was accustomed to that. He would\r\nsometimes be their victim in this way at the end of an evening when, in\r\nview of the position he occupied, he had been unduly brilliant. Had it\r\nnot been for the especial welcome with which Mathilde would greet him,\r\nand the curiosity with which all this society inspired him, he would\r\nhave avoided following these brilliant moustachioed young men into the\r\ngarden, when they accompanied mademoiselle de La Mole there, in the\r\nhour after dinner.\r\n\r\n"Yes," Julien would say to himself, "it is impossible for me to deceive\r\nmyself, mademoiselle de la Mole looks at me in a very singular way.\r\nBut even when her fine blue open eyes are fixed on me, wide open with\r\nthe most abandon, I always detect behind them an element of scrutiny,\r\nself-possession and malice. Is it possible that this may be love? But\r\nhow different to madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s looks!"\r\n\r\nOne evening after dinner Julien, who had followed M. de la Mole into\r\nhis study, was rapidly walking back to the garden. He approached\r\nMathilde\'s circle without any warning, and caught some words pronounced\r\nin a very loud voice. She was teasing her brother. Julien heard his\r\nname distinctly pronounced twice. He appeared. There was immediately\r\na profound silence and abortive efforts were made to dissipate it.\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole and her brother were too animated to find\r\nanother topic of conversation. MM. de Caylus, de Croisenois, de Luz,\r\nand one of their friends, manifested an icy coldness to Julien. He went\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nA PLOT\r\n\r\n\r\n        Disconnected remarks, casual meetings, become\r\n        transformed in the eyes of an imaginative man into\r\n        the most convincing proofs, if he has any fire in his\r\n        temperament.--_Schiller_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day he again caught Norbert and his sister talking about\r\nhim. A funereal silence was established on his arrival as on the\r\nprevious day. His suspicions were now unbounded. "Can these charming\r\nyoung people have started to make fun of me? I must own this is much\r\nmore probable, much more natural than any suggested passion on the part\r\nof mademoiselle de La Mole for a poor devil of a secretary. In the\r\nfirst place, have those people got any passions at all? Mystification\r\nis their strong point. They are jealous of my poor little superiority\r\nin speaking. Being jealous again is one of their weaknesses. On that\r\nbasis everything is explicable. Mademoiselle de La Mole simply wants to\r\npersuade me that she is marking me out for special favour in order to\r\nshow me off to her betrothed?"\r\n\r\nThis cruel suspicion completely changed Julien\'s psychological\r\ncondition. The idea found in his heart a budding love which it had no\r\ndifficulty in destroying. This love was only founded on Mathilde\'s rare\r\nbeauty, or rather on her queenly manners and her admirable dresses.\r\nJulien was still a parvenu in this respect. We are assured that there\r\nis nothing equal to a pretty society women for dazzling a peasant\r\nwho is at the same time a man of intellect, when he is admitted to\r\nfirst class society. It had not been Mathilde\'s character which had\r\ngiven Julien food for dreams in the days that had just passed. He had\r\nsufficient sense to realise that he knew nothing about her character.\r\nAll he saw of it might be merely superficial.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Mathilde would not have missed mass on Sunday for\r\nanything in the world. She accompanied her mother there nearly every\r\ntime. If when in the salon of the H\xc3\xb4tel de La Mole some indiscreet man\r\nforgot where he was, and indulged in the remotest allusion to any jest\r\nagainst the real or supposed interests of Church or State, Mathilde\r\nimmediately assumed an icy seriousness. Her previously arch expression\r\nre-assumed all the impassive haughtiness of an old family portrait.\r\n\r\nBut Julien had assured himself that she always had one or two of\r\nVoltaire\'s most philosophic volumes in her room. He himself would\r\noften steal some tomes of that fine edition which was so magnificently\r\nbound. By moving each volume a little distance from the one next to it\r\nhe managed to hide the absence of the one he took away, but he soon\r\nnoticed that someone else was reading Voltaire. He had recourse to a\r\ntrick worthy of the seminary and placed some pieces of hair on those\r\nvolumes which he thought were likely to interest mademoiselle de La\r\nMole. They disappeared for whole weeks.\r\n\r\nM. de La Mole had lost patience with his bookseller, who always sent\r\nhim all the spurious memoirs, and had instructed Julien to buy all the\r\nnew books, which were at all stimulating. But in order to prevent the\r\npoison spreading over the household, the secretary was ordered to place\r\nthe books in a little book-case that stood in the marquis\'s own room.\r\nHe was soon quite certain that although the new books were hostile to\r\nthe interests of both State and Church, they very quickly disappeared.\r\nIt was certainly not Norbert who read them.\r\n\r\nJulien attached undue importance to this discovery, and attributed to\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole a Machiavellian r\xc3\xb4le. This seeming depravity\r\nconstituted a charm in his eyes, the one moral charm, in fact, which\r\nshe possessed. He was led into this extravagance by his boredom with\r\nhypocrisy and moral platitudes.\r\n\r\nIt was more a case of his exciting his own imagination than of his\r\nbeing swept away by his love.\r\n\r\nIt was only after he had abandoned himself to reveries about the\r\nelegance of mademoiselle de la Mole\'s figure, the excellent taste\r\nof he dress, the whiteness of her hand, the beauty of her arm, the\r\n_disinvoltura_ of all her movements, that he began to find himself in\r\nlove. Then in order to complete the charm he thought her a Catherine\r\nde\' Medici. Nothing was too deep or too criminal for the character\r\nwhich he ascribed to her. She was the ideal of the Maslons, the\r\nFrilairs, and the Castan\xc3\xa8des whom he had admired so much in his youth.\r\nTo put it shortly, she represented in his eyes the Paris ideal.\r\n\r\nCould anything possibly be more humorous than believing in the depth or\r\nin the depravity of the Parisian character?\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that this _trio_ is making fun of me thought Julien.\r\nThe reader knows little of his character if he has not begun already\r\nto imagine his cold and gloomy expression when he answered Mathilde\'s\r\nlooks. A bitter irony rebuffed those assurances of friendship which the\r\nastonished mademoiselle de la Mole ventured to hazard on two or three\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nPiqued by this sudden eccentricity, the heart of this young girl,\r\nthough naturally cold, bored and intellectual, became as impassioned as\r\nit was naturally capable of being. But there was also a large element\r\nof pride in Mathilde\'s character, and the birth of a sentiment which\r\nmade all her happiness dependent on another, was accompanied by a\r\ngloomy melancholy.\r\n\r\nJulien had derived sufficient advantage from his stay in Paris to\r\nappreciate that this was not the frigid melancholy of ennui. Instead\r\nof being keen as she had been on at homes, theatres, and all kinds of\r\ndistractions, she now shunned them.\r\n\r\nMusic sung by Frenchmen bored Mathilde to death, yet Julien, who\r\nalways made a point of being present when the audience came out of the\r\nOpera, noticed that she made a point of getting taken there as often\r\nas she could. He thought he noticed that she had lost a little of that\r\nbrilliant neatness of touch which used to be manifest in everything\r\nshe did. She would sometimes answer her friends with jests rendered\r\npositively outrageous through the sheer force of their stinging energy.\r\nHe thought that she made a special butt of the marquis de Croisenois.\r\nThat young man must be desperately in love with money not to give the\r\ngo-by to that girl, however rich she maybe, thought Julien. And as for\r\nhimself, indignant at these outrages on masculine self-respect, he\r\nredoubled his frigidity towards her. Sometimes he went so far as to\r\nanswer her with scant courtesy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his resolution not to become the dupe of Mathilde\'s signs\r\nof interest, these manifestations were so palpable on certain days, and\r\nJulien, whose eyes were beginning to be opened, began to find her so\r\npretty, that he was sometimes embarrassed.\r\n\r\n"These young people of society will score in the long run by their\r\nskill and their coolness over my inexperience," he said to himself. "I\r\nmust leave and put an end to all this." The marquis had just entrusted\r\nhim with the administration of a number of small estates and houses\r\nwhich he possessed in Lower Languedoc. A journey was necessary; M. de\r\nla Mole reluctantly consented. Julien had become his other self, except\r\nin those matters which concerned his political career.\r\n\r\n"So, when we come to balance the account," Julien said to himself,\r\nas he prepared his departure, "they have not caught me. Whether the\r\njests that mademoiselle de la Mole made to those gentlemen are real,\r\nor whether they were only intended to inspire me with confidence, they\r\nhave simply amused me.\r\n\r\n"If there is no conspiracy against the carpenter\'s son, mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole is an enigma, but at any rate, she is quite as much an enigma\r\nfor the marquis de Croisenois as she is to me. Yesterday, for instance,\r\nher bad temper was very real, and I had the pleasure of seeing her\r\nsnub, thanks to her favour for me, a young man who is as noble and as\r\nrich as I am a poor scoundrel of a plebeian. That is my finest triumph;\r\nit will divert me in my post-chaise as I traverse the Languedoc plains."\r\n\r\nHe had kept his departure a secret, but Mathilde knew, even better than\r\nhe did himself, that he was going to leave Paris the following day for\r\na long time. She developed a maddening headache, which was rendered\r\nworse by the stuffy salon. She walked a great deal in the garden, and\r\npersecuted Norbert, the marquis de Croisenois, Caylus, de Luz, and\r\nsome other young men who had dined at the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole, to such an\r\nextent by her mordant witticisms, that she drove them to take their\r\nleave. She kept looking at Julien in a strange way.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that look is a pose," thought Julien, "but how about that\r\nhurried breathing and all that agitation? Bah," he said to himself,\r\n"who am I to judge of such things? We are dealing with the cream of\r\nParisian sublimity and subtlety. As for that hurried breathing which\r\nwas on the point of affecting me, she no doubt studied it with L\xc3\xa9ontine\r\nFay, whom she likes so much."\r\n\r\nThey were left alone; the conversation was obviously languishing. "No,\r\nJulien has no feeling for me," said Mathilde to herself, in a state of\r\nreal unhappiness.\r\n\r\nAs he was taking leave of her she took his arm violently.\r\n\r\n"You will receive a letter from me this evening," she said to him in a\r\nvoice that was so changed that its tone was scarcely recognisable.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance affected Julien immediately.\r\n\r\n"My father," she continued, "has a proper regard for the services you\r\nrender him. You must not leave to-morrow; find an excuse." And she ran\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHer figure was charming. It was impossible to have a prettier foot. She\r\nran with a grace which fascinated Julien, but will the reader guess\r\nwhat he began to think about after she had finally left him? He felt\r\nwounded by the imperious tone with which she had said the words, "you\r\nmust." Louis XV. too, when on his death-bed, had been keenly irritated\r\nby the words "you must," which had been tactlessly pronounced by his\r\nfirst physician, and yet Louis XV. was not a parvenu.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards a footman gave Julien a letter. It was quite simply\r\na declaration of love.\r\n\r\n"The style is too affected," said Julien to himself, as he endeavoured\r\nto control by his literary criticism the joy which was spreading over\r\nhis cheeks and forcing him to smile in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nAt last his passionate exultation was too strong to be controlled. "So\r\nI," he suddenly exclaimed, "I, the poor peasant, get a declaration of\r\nlove from a great lady."\r\n\r\n"As for myself, I haven\'t done so badly," he added, restraining his\r\njoy as much as he could. "I have managed to preserve my self-respect.\r\nI did not say that I loved her." He began to study the formation of\r\nthe letters. Mademoiselle de la Mole had a pretty little English\r\nhandwriting. He needed some concrete occupation to distract him from a\r\njoy which verged on delirium.\r\n\r\n"Your departure forces me to speak.... I could not bear not to see you\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nA thought had just struck Julien like a new discovery. It interrupted\r\nhis examination of Mathilde\'s letter, and redoubled his joy. "So I\r\nscore over the marquis de Croisenois," he exclaimed. "Yes, I who could\r\nonly talk seriously! And he is so handsome. He has a moustache and a\r\ncharming uniform. He always manages to say something witty and clever\r\njust at the psychological moment."\r\n\r\nJulien experienced a delightful minute. He was wandering at random in\r\nthe garden, mad with happiness.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he went up to his desk, and had himself ushered in to the\r\nmarquis de la Mole, who was fortunately still in. He showed him several\r\nstamped papers which had come from Normandy, and had no difficulty\r\nin convincing him that he was obliged to put off his departure for\r\nLanguedoc in order to look after the Normandy lawsuits.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad that you are not going," said the marquis to him, when\r\nthey had finished talking business. "I like seeing you." Julien went\r\nout; the words irritated him.\r\n\r\n"And I--I am going to seduce his daughter! and perhaps render\r\nimpossible that marriage with the marquis de Croisenois to which the\r\nmarquis looks forward with such delight. If he does not get made a\r\nduke, at any rate his daughter will have a coronet." Julien thought of\r\nleaving for Languedoc in spite of Mathilde\'s letter, and in spite of\r\nthe explanation he had just given to the marquis. This flash of virtue\r\nquickly disappeared.\r\n\r\n"How kind it is of me," he said to himself, "me ... a plebeian, takes\r\npity on a family of this rank! Yes, me, whom the duke of Chaulnes\r\ncalls a servant! How does the marquis manage to increase his immense\r\nfortune? By selling stock when he picks up information at the castle\r\nthat there will be a panic of a _coup d\'\xc3\xa9tat_ on the following day.\r\nAnd shall I, who have been flung down into the lowest class by a cruel\r\nprovidence--I, whom providence has given a noble heart but not an\r\nincome of a thousand francs, that is to say, not enough to buy bread\r\nwith, literally not enough to buy bread with--shall I refuse a pleasure\r\nthat presents itself? A limpid fountain which will quench my thirst in\r\nthis scorching desert of mediocrity which I am traversing with such\r\ndifficulty! Upon my word, I am not such a fool! Each man for himself in\r\nthat desert of egoism which is called life."\r\n\r\nAnd he remembered certain disdainful looks which madame de la Mole, and\r\nespecially her lady friends, had favoured him with.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure of scoring over the marquis de Croisenois completed the\r\nrout of this echo of virtue.\r\n\r\n"How I should like to make him angry," said Julien. "With what\r\nconfidence would I give him a sword thrust now!" And he went through\r\nthe segoon thrust. "Up till now I have been a mere usher, who exploited\r\nbasely the little courage he had. After this letter I am his equal.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he slowly said to himself, with an infinite pleasure, "the\r\nmerits of the marquis and myself have been weighed in the balance, and\r\nit is the poor carpenter from the Jura who turns the scale.\r\n\r\n"Good!" he exclaimed, "this is how I shall sign my answer. Don\'t\r\nimagine, mademoiselle de la Mole, that I am forgetting my place. I will\r\nmake you realise and fully appreciate that it is for a carpenter\'s son\r\nthat you are betraying a descendant of the famous Guy de Croisenois who\r\nfollowed St. Louis to the Crusade."\r\n\r\nJulien was unable to control his joy. He was obliged to go down into\r\nthe garden. He had locked himself in his room, but he found it too\r\nnarrow to breathe in.\r\n\r\n"To think of it being me, the poor peasant from the Jura," he kept\r\non repeating to himself, "to think of it being me who am eternally\r\ncondemned to wear this gloomy black suit! Alas twenty years ago I would\r\nhave worn a uniform like they do! In those days a man like me either\r\ngot killed or became a general at thirty-six. The letter which he held\r\nclenched in his hand gave him a heroic pose and stature. Nowadays, it\r\nis true, if one sticks to this black suit, one gets at forty an income\r\nof a hundred thousand francs and the blue ribbon like my lord bishop of\r\nBeauvais.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said to himself with a Mephistophelian smile, "I have more\r\nbrains than they. I am shrewd enough to choose the uniform of my\r\ncentury. And he felt a quickening of his ambition and of his attachment\r\nto his ecclesiastical dress. What cardinals of even lower birth than\r\nmine have not succeeded in governing! My compatriot Granvelle, for\r\ninstance."\r\n\r\nJulien\'s agitation became gradually calmed! Prudence emerged to the\r\ntop. He said to himself like his master Tartuffe whose part he knew by\r\nheart:\r\n\r\n    Je puis croire ces mots, un artifice honn\xc3\xaate.\r\n    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n    Je ne me firai point \xc3\xa0 des propos si doux,\r\n    Qu\'un peu de ses faveurs apr\xc3\xa8s quoi je soupire\r\n    Ne vienne m\'assurer tout ce qu\'ils m\'ont pudire.\r\n                                  _Tartuffe, act iv. Scene v_.\r\n\r\n"Tartuffe, too, was ruined by a woman, and he was as good as most\r\nmen.... My answer may be shown.... and the way out of that is this," he\r\nadded pronouncing his words slowly with an intonation of deliberate and\r\nrestrained ferocity. "We will begin by quoting the most vivid passages\r\nfrom the letter of the sublime Mathilde."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, but M. de Croisenois\' lackeys will hurl themselves upon me\r\nand snatch the original away."\r\n\r\n"No, they won\'t, for I am well armed, and as we know I am accustomed to\r\nfiring on lackeys."\r\n\r\n"Well, suppose one of them has courage, and hurls himself upon me. He\r\nhas been promised a hundred napoleons. I kill him, or wound him, good,\r\nthat\'s what they want. I shall be thrown into prison legally. I shall\r\nbe had up in the police court and the judges will send me with all\r\njustice and all equity to keep Messieurs Fontan and Magalon company\r\nin Poissy. There I shall be landed in the middle of four hundred\r\nscoundrels.... And am I to have the slightest pity on these people,"\r\nhe exclaimed getting up impetuously! "Do they show any to persons of\r\nthe third estate when they have them in their power!" With these words\r\nhis gratitude to M. de la Mole, which had been in spite of himself\r\ntorturing his conscience up to this time, breathed its last.\r\n\r\n"Softly, gentlemen, I follow this little Machiavellian trick, the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nMaslon or M. Castan\xc3\xa8de of the seminary could not have done better. You\r\nwill take the provocative letter away from me and I shall exemplify the\r\nsecond volume of Colonel Caron at Colmar."\r\n\r\n"One moment, gentlemen, I will send the fatal letter in a well-sealed\r\npacket to M. the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard to take care of. He\'s an honest man, a\r\nJansenist, and consequently incorruptible. Yes, but he will open the\r\nletters.... Fouqu\xc3\xa9 is the man to whom I must send it."\r\n\r\nWe must admit that Julien\'s expression was awful, his countenance\r\nghastly; it breathed unmitigated criminality. It represented the\r\nunhappy man at war with all society.\r\n\r\n"To arms," exclaimed Julien. And he bounded up the flight of steps\r\nof the hotel with one stride. He entered the stall of the street\r\nscrivener; he frightened him. "Copy this," he said, giving him\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole\'s letter.\r\n\r\nWhile the scrivener was working, he himself wrote to Fouqu\xc3\xa9. He asked\r\nhim to take care of a valuable deposit. "But he said to himself,"\r\nbreaking in upon his train of thought, "the secret service of the\r\npost-office will open my letter, and will give you gentlemen the one\r\nyou are looking for ... not quite, gentlemen." He went and bought an\r\nenormous Bible from a Protestant bookseller, skillfully hid Mathilde\'s\r\nletter in the cover, and packed it all up. His parcel left by the\r\ndiligence addressed to one of Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s workmen, whose name was known to\r\nnobody at Paris.\r\n\r\nThis done, he returned to the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole, joyous and buoyant.\r\n\r\nNow it\'s our turn he exclaimed as he locked himself into the room and\r\nthrew off his coat.\r\n\r\n"What! mademoiselle," he wrote to Mathilde, "is it mademoiselle de la\r\nMole who gets Ars\xc3\xa8ne her father\'s lackey to hand an only too flattering\r\nletter to a poor carpenter from the Jura, in order no doubt to make\r\nfun of his simplicity?" And he copied out the most explicit phrases in\r\nthe letter which he had just received. His own letter would have done\r\nhonour to the diplomatic prudence of M. the Chevalier de Beauvoisis.\r\nIt was still only ten o\'clock when Julien entered the Italian opera,\r\nintoxicated with happiness and that feeling of his own power which was\r\nso novel for a poor devil like him. He heard his friend Geronimo sing.\r\nMusic had never exalted him to such a pitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nA YOUNG GIRL\'S THOUGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\n        What perplexity! What sleepless nights! Great God. Am I\r\n        going to make myself contemptible? He will despise me\r\n        himself. But he is leaving, he is going away.\r\n                                    _Alfred de Musset_\r\n\r\n\r\nMathilde had not written without a struggle. Whatever might have been\r\nthe beginning of her interest in Julien, it soon dominated that pride\r\nwhich had reigned unchallenged in her heart since she had begun to know\r\nherself. This cold and haughty soul was swept away for the first time\r\nby a sentiment of passion, but if this passion dominated her pride,\r\nit still kept faithfully to the habits of that pride. Two months of\r\nstruggles and new sensations had transformed, so to speak her whole\r\nmoral life.\r\n\r\nMathilde thought she was in sight of happiness. This vista,\r\nirresistible as it is for those who combine a superior intellect with\r\na courageous soul, had to struggle for a long time against her self\r\nrespect and all her vulgar duties. One day she went into her mother\'s\r\nroom at seven o\'clock in the morning and asked permission to take\r\nrefuge in Villequier. The marquise did not even deign to answer her,\r\nand advised her to go back to bed. This was the last effort of vulgar\r\nprudence and respect for tradition.\r\n\r\nThe fear of doing wrong and of offending those ideas which the\r\nCaylus\'s, the de Luz\'s, the Croisenois\' held for sacred had little\r\npower over her soul. She considered such creatures incapable of\r\nunderstanding her. She would have consulted them, if it had been a\r\nmatter of buying a carriage or an estate. Her real fear was that Julien\r\nwas displeased with her.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he, too, has only the appearance of a superior man?"\r\n\r\nShe abhorred lack of character; that was her one objection to the\r\nhandsome young men who surrounded her. The more they made elegant\r\nfun of everything which deviated from the prevailing mode, or which\r\nconformed to it but indifferently, the lower they fell in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were brave and that was all. "And after all in what way were they\r\nbrave?" she said to herself. "In duels, but the duel is nothing more\r\nthan a formality. The whole thing is mapped out beforehand, even the\r\ncorrect thing to say when you fall. Stretched on the turf, and with\r\nyour hand on your heart, you must vouchsafe a generous forgiveness to\r\nthe adversary, and a few words for a fair lady, who is often imaginary,\r\nor if she does exist, will go to a ball on the day of your death for\r\nfear of arousing suspicion."\r\n\r\n"One braves danger at the head of a squadron brilliant with steel, but\r\nhow about that danger which is solitary, strange, unforeseen and really\r\nugly."\r\n\r\n"Alas," said Mathilde to herself, "it was at the court of Henri III.\r\nthat men who were great both by character and by birth were to be\r\nfound! Yes! If Julien had served at Jarnac or Moncontour, I should no\r\nlonger doubt. In those days of strength and vigour Frenchmen were not\r\ndolls. The day of the battle was almost the one which presented the\r\nfewest problems."\r\n\r\nTheir life was not imprisoned, like an Egyptian mummy in a covering\r\nwhich was common to all, and always the same. "Yes," she added, "there\r\nwas more real courage in going home alone at eleven o\'clock in the\r\nevening when one came out of the H\xc3\xb4tel de Soissons where Catherine\r\nde\' Medici lived than there is nowadays in running over to Algiers.\r\nA man\'s life was then a series of hazards. Nowadays civilisation has\r\nbanished hazard. There are no more surprises. If anything new appears\r\nin any idea there are not sufficient epigrams to immortalise it, but if\r\nanything new appears in actual life, our panic reaches the lowest depth\r\nof cowardice. Whatever folly panic makes us commit is excused. What a\r\ndegenerate and boring age! What would Boniface de la Mole have said\r\nif, lifting his cut-off head out of the tomb, he had seen seventeen of\r\nhis descendants allow themselves to be caught like sheep in 1793 in\r\norder to be guillotined two days afterwards! Death was certain, but it\r\nwould have been bad form to have defended themselves and to have killed\r\nat least one or two Jacobins. Yes! in the heroic days of France, in\r\nthe age of Boniface de la Mole, Julien would have been the chief of\r\na squadron, while my brother would have been the young priest with\r\ndecorous manners, with wisdom in his eyes and reason on his lips." Some\r\nmonths previously Mathilde had given up all hope of meeting any being\r\nwho was a little different from the common pattern. She had found some\r\nhappiness in allowing herself to write to some young society men. This\r\nrash procedure, which was so unbecoming and so imprudent in a young\r\ngirl, might have disgraced her in the eyes of M. de Croisenois, the\r\nDuke de Chaulnes, his father, and the whole H\xc3\xb4tel de Chaulnes, who on\r\nseeing the projected marriage broken off would have wanted to know the\r\nreason. At that time Mathilde had been unable to sleep on those days\r\nwhen she had written one of her letters. But those letters were only\r\nanswers. But now she ventured to declare her own love. She wrote first\r\n(what a terrible word!) to a man of the lowest social grade.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance rendered her eternal disgrace quite inevitable in the\r\nevent of detection. Who of the women who visited her mother would have\r\ndared to take her part? What official excuse could be evolved which\r\ncould successfully cope with the awful contempt of society.\r\n\r\nBesides speaking was awful enough, but writing! "There are some\r\nthings which are not written!" Napoleon had exclaimed on learning of\r\nthe capitulation of Baylen. And it was Julien who had told her that\r\nepigram, as though giving her a lesson that was to come in useful\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nBut all this was comparatively unimportant, Mathilde\'s anguish had\r\nother causes. Forgetting the terrible effect it would produce on\r\nsociety, and the ineffable blot on her scutcheon that would follow such\r\nan outrage on her own caste, Mathilde was going to write to a person\r\nof a very different character to the Croisenois\', the de Luz\'s, the\r\nCaylus\'s.\r\n\r\nShe would have been frightened at the depth and mystery in Julien\'s\r\ncharacter, even if she had merely entered into a conventional\r\nacquaintance with him. And she was going to make him her lover, perhaps\r\nher master.\r\n\r\n"What will his pretensions not be, if he is ever in a position to do\r\neverything with me? Well! I shall say, like Medea: _Au milieu de tant\r\nde p\xc3\xa9rils il me reste Moi_." She believed that Julien had no respect\r\nfor nobility of blood. What was more, he probably did not love her.\r\n\r\nIn these last moments of awful doubt her feminine pride suggested to\r\nher certain ideas. "Everything is bound to be extraordinary in the life\r\nof a girl like me," exclaimed Mathilde impatiently. The pride, which\r\nhad been drilled into her since her cradle, began to struggle with her\r\nvirtue. It was at this moment that Julien\'s departure precipitated\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n(Such characters are luckily very rare.)\r\n\r\nVery late in the evening, Julien was malicious enough to have a very\r\nheavy trunk taken down to the porter\'s lodge. He called the valet, who\r\nwas courting mademoiselle de la Mole\'s chambermaid, to move it. "This\r\nman\xc5\x93uvre cannot result in anything," he said to himself, "but if it\r\ndoes succeed, she will think that I have gone." Very tickled by this\r\nhumorous thought, he fell asleep. Mathilde did not sleep a wink.\r\n\r\nJulien left the h\xc3\xb4tel very early the next morning without being seen,\r\nbut he came back before eight o\'clock.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely entered the library before M. de la Mole appeared\r\non the threshold. He handed her his answer. He thought that it was\r\nhis duty to speak to her, it was certainly perfectly feasible, but\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole would not listen to him and disappeared. Julien\r\nwas delighted. He did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n"If all this is not a put up job with comte Norbert, it is clear that\r\nit is my cold looks which have kindled the strange love which this\r\naristocratic girl chooses to entertain for me. I should be really\r\ntoo much of a fool if I ever allowed myself to take a fancy to that\r\nbig blonde doll." This train of reasoning left him colder and more\r\ncalculating than he had ever been.\r\n\r\n"In the battle for which we are preparing," he added, "pride of birth\r\nwill be like a high hill which constitutes a military position between\r\nher and me. That must be the field of the man\xc5\x93uvres. I made a great\r\nmistake in staying in Paris; this postponing of my departure cheapens\r\nand exposes me, if all this is simply a trick. What danger was there in\r\nleaving? If they were making fun of me, I was making fun of them. If\r\nher interest for me was in any way real, I was making that interest a\r\nhundred times more intense."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole\'s letter had given Julien\'s vanity so keen a\r\npleasure, that wreathed as he was in smiles at his good fortune he had\r\nforgotten to think seriously about the propriety of leaving.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the fatal elements of his character to be extremely\r\nsensitive to his own weaknesses. He was extremely upset by this one,\r\nand had almost forgotten the incredible victory which had preceded this\r\nslight check, when about nine o\'clock mademoiselle de la Mole appeared\r\non the threshold of the library, flung him a letter and ran away.\r\n\r\n"So this is going to be the romance by letters," he said as he picked\r\nit up. "The enemy makes a false move; I will reply by coldness and\r\nvirtue."\r\n\r\nHe was asked with a poignancy which merely increased his inner gaiety\r\nto give a definite answer. He indulged in the pleasure of mystifying\r\nthose persons who he thought wanted to make fun of him for two pages,\r\nand it was out of humour again that he announced towards the end of his\r\nanswer his definite departure on the following morning.\r\n\r\n"The garden will be a useful place to hand her the letter," he thought\r\nafter he had finished it, and he went there. He looked at the window of\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole\'s room.\r\n\r\nIt was on the first storey, next to her mother\'s apartment, but there\r\nwas a large ground floor.\r\n\r\nThis latter was so high that, as Julien walked under the avenue\r\nof pines with his letter in his hands, he could not be seen from\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole\'s window. The dome formed by the well clipped\r\npines intercepted the view. "What!" said Julien to himself angrily,\r\n"another indiscretion! If they have really begun making fun of me,\r\nshowing myself with a letter is playing into my enemy\'s hands."\r\n\r\nNorbert\'s room was exactly above his sister\'s and if Julien came out\r\nfrom under the dome formed by the clipped branches of the pine, the\r\ncomte and his friend could follow all his movements.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole appeared behind her window; he half showed his\r\nletter; she lowered her head, then Julien ran up to his own room and\r\nmet accidentally on the main staircase the fair Mathilde, who seized\r\nthe letter with complete self-possession and smiling eyes.\r\n\r\n"What passion there was in the eyes of that poor madame de R\xc3\xaanal," said\r\nJulien to himself, "when she ventured to receive a letter from me,\r\neven after six months of intimate relationship! I don\'t think she ever\r\nlooked at me with smiling eyes in her whole life."\r\n\r\nHe did not formulate so precisely the rest of his answer; was he\r\nperhaps ashamed of the triviality of the motive which were actuating\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n"But how different too," he went on to think, "are her elegant morning\r\ndress and her distinguished appearance! A man of taste on seeing\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole thirty yards off would infer the position which\r\nshe occupies in society. That is what can be called a specific merit."\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this humorousness, Julien was not yet quite honest with\r\nhimself; madame de R\xc3\xaanal had no marquis de Croisenois to sacrifice to\r\nhim. His only rival was that grotesque sub-prefect, M. Charcot, who\r\nassumed the name of Maugiron, because there were no Maugirons left in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAt five o\'clock Julien received a third letter. It was thrown to him\r\nfrom the library door. Mademoiselle de la Mole ran away again. "What\r\na mania for writing," he said to himself with a laugh, "when one can\r\ntalk so easily. The enemy wants my letters, that is clear, and many of\r\nthem." He did not hurry to open this one. "More elegant phrases," he\r\nthought; but he paled as he read it. There were only eight lines.\r\n\r\n"I need to speak to you; I must speak to you this evening. Be in\r\nthe garden at the moment when one o\'clock is striking. Take the big\r\ngardeners\' ladder near the well; place it against my window, and climb\r\nup to my room. It is moonlight; never mind."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nIS IT A PLOT?\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, how cruel is the interval between the conception\r\nand the execution of a great project. What vain fears,\r\nwhat fits of irresolution! It is a matter of life and\r\ndeath--even more is at stake honour!--_Schiller_.\r\n\r\n\r\n"This is getting serious," thought Julien, "and a little too clear,"\r\nhe added after thinking a little. "Why to be sure! This fine young\r\nlady can talk to me in the library with a freedom which, thank heaven,\r\nis absolutely complete; the marquis, frightened as he is that I show\r\nhim accounts, never sets foot in it. Why! M. de la Mole and the comte\r\nNorbert, the only persons who ever come here, are absent nearly the\r\nwhole day, and the sublime Mathilde for whom a sovereign prince\r\nwould not be too noble a suitor, wants me to commit an abominable\r\nindiscretion.\r\n\r\n"It is clear they want to ruin me, or at the least make fun of me.\r\nFirst they wanted to ruin me by my own letters; they happen to be\r\ndiscreet; well, they want some act which is clearer than daylight.\r\nThese handsome little gentlemen think I am too silly or too conceited.\r\nThe devil! To think of climbing like this up a ladder to a storey\r\ntwenty-five feet high in the finest moonlight. They would have time to\r\nsee me, even from the neighbouring houses. I shall cut a pretty figure\r\nto be sure on my ladder!" Julien went up to his room again and began\r\nto pack his trunk whistling. He had decided to leave and not even to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nBut this wise resolution did not give him peace of mind. "If by\r\nchance," he suddenly said to himself after he had closed his trunk,\r\n"Mathilde is in good faith, why then I cut the figure of an arrant\r\ncoward in her eyes. I have no birth myself, so I need great qualities\r\nattested straight away by speaking actions--money down--no charitable\r\ncredit."\r\n\r\nHe spent a quarter-of-an-hour in reflecting. "What is the good of\r\ndenying it?" he said at last. "She will think me a coward. I shall lose\r\nnot only the most brilliant person in high society, as they all said at\r\nM. the duke de Retz\'s ball, but also the heavenly pleasure of seeing\r\nthe marquis de Croisenois, the son of a duke, who will be one day a\r\nduke himself, sacrificed to me. A charming young man who has all the\r\nqualities I lack. A happy wit, birth, fortune....\r\n\r\n"This regret will haunt me all my life, not on her account, \'there are\r\nso many mistresses!... but there is only one honour!\' says old don\r\nDi\xc3\xa9go. And here am I clearly and palpably shrinking from the first\r\ndanger that presents itself; for the duel with M. de Beauvoisis was\r\nsimply a joke. This is quite different. A servant may fire at me point\r\nblank, but that is the least danger; I may be disgraced.\r\n\r\n"This is getting serious, my boy," he added with a Gascon gaiety and\r\naccent. "Honour is at stake. A poor devil flung by chance into as low a\r\ngrade as I am will never find such an opportunity again. I shall have\r\nmy conquests, but they will be inferior ones...."\r\n\r\nHe reflected for a long time, he walked up and down hurriedly, and\r\nthen from time to time would suddenly stop. A magnificent marble bust\r\nof cardinal de Richelieu had been placed in his room. It attracted his\r\ngaze in spite of himself. This bust seemed to look at him severely as\r\nthough reproaching him with the lack of that audacity which ought to be\r\nso natural to the French character. "Would I have hesitated in your age\r\ngreat man?"\r\n\r\n"At the worst," said Julien to himself, "suppose all this is a trap,\r\nit is pretty black and pretty compromising for a young girl. They know\r\nthat I am not the man to hold my tongue. They will therefore have to\r\nkill me. That was right enough in 1574 in the days of Boniface de la\r\nMole, but nobody today would ever have the pluck. They are not the same\r\nmen. Mademoiselle de la Mole is the object of so much jealousy. Four\r\nhundred salons would ring with her disgrace to-morrow, and how pleased\r\nthey would all be.\r\n\r\n"The servants gossip among themselves about marked the favours of\r\nwhich I am the recipient. I know it, I have heard them....\r\n\r\n"On the other hand they\'re her letters. They may think that I have\r\nthem on me. They may surprise me in her room and take them from me. I\r\nshall have to deal with two, three, or four men. How can I tell? But\r\nwhere are they going to find these men? Where are they to find discreet\r\nsubordinates in Paris? Justice frightens them.... By God! It may be the\r\nCaylus\'s, the Croisenois\', the de Luz\'s themselves. The idea of the\r\nludicrous figure I should cut in the middle of them at the particular\r\nminute may have attracted them. Look out for the fate of Ab\xc3\xa9lard, M.\r\nthe secretary.\r\n\r\n"Well, by heaven, I\'ll mark you. I\'ll strike at your faces like C\xc3\xa6sar\'s\r\nsoldiers at Pharsalia. As for the letters, I can put them in a safe\r\nplace."\r\n\r\nJulien copied out the two last, hid them in a fine volume of Voltaire\r\nin the library and himself took the originals to the post.\r\n\r\n"What folly am I going to rush into," he said to himself with surprise\r\nand terror when he returned. He had been a quarter of an hour without\r\ncontemplating what he was to do on this coming night.\r\n\r\n"But if I refuse, I am bound to despise myself afterwards. This matter\r\nwill always occasion me great doubt during my whole life, and to a man\r\nlike me such doubts are the most poignant unhappiness. Did I not feel\r\nlike that for Amanda\'s lover! I think I would find it easier to forgive\r\nmyself for a perfectly clear crime; once admitted, I could leave off\r\nthinking of it.\r\n\r\n"Why! I shall have been the rival of a man who bears one of the finest\r\nnames in France, and then out of pure light-heartedness, declared\r\nmyself his inferior! After all, it is cowardly not to go; these words\r\nclinch everything," exclaimed Julien as he got up ... "besides she is\r\nquite pretty."\r\n\r\n"If this is not a piece of treachery, what a folly is she not\r\ncommitting for my sake. If it\'s a piece of mystification, by heaven,\r\ngentlemen, it only depends on me to turn the jest into earnest and that\r\nI will do.\r\n\r\n"But supposing they tie my hands together at the moment I enter the\r\nroom: they may have placed some ingenious machine there.\r\n\r\n"It\'s like a duel," he said to himself with a laugh. "Everyone makes\r\na full parade, says my _ma\xc3\xaetre d\'armes_, but the good God, who wishes\r\nthe thing to end, makes one of them forget to parry. Besides, here\'s\r\nsomething to answer them with." He drew his pistols out of his pocket,\r\nand although the priming was shining, he renewed it.\r\n\r\nThere was still several hours to wait. Julien wrote to Fouqu\xc3\xa9 in order\r\nto have something to do. "My friend, do not open the enclosed letter\r\nexcept in the event of an accident, if you hear that something strange\r\nhas happened to me. In that case blot out the proper names in the\r\nmanuscript which I am sending you, make eight copies of it, and send\r\nit to the papers of Marseilles, Bordeaux, Lyons, Brussels, etc. Ten\r\ndays later have the manuscript printed, send the first copy to M. the\r\nmarquis de la Mole, and a fortnight after that throw the other copies\r\nat night into the streets of Verri\xc3\xa8res."\r\n\r\nJulien made this little memoir in defence of his position as little\r\ncompromising as possible for mademoiselle de la Mole. Fouqu\xc3\xa9 was only\r\nto open it in the event of an accident. It was put in the form of a\r\nstory, but in fact it exactly described his situation.\r\n\r\nJulien had just fastened his packet when the dinner bell rang. It made\r\nhis heart beat. His imagination was distracted by the story which he\r\nhad just composed, and fell a prey to tragic presentiments. He saw\r\nhimself seized by servants, trussed, and taken into a cellar with a gag\r\nin his mouth. A servant was stationed there, who never let him out of\r\nsight, and if the family honour required that the adventure should have\r\na tragic end, it was easy to finish everything with those poisons which\r\nleave no trace. They could then say that he had died of an illness and\r\nwould carry his dead body back into his room.\r\n\r\nThrilled like a dramatic author by his own story, Julien was really\r\nafraid when he entered the dining-room. He looked at all those liveried\r\nservants--he studied their faces. "Which ones are chosen for to-night\'s\r\nexpedition?" he said to himself. "The memories of the court of Henri\r\nIII. are so vivid in this family, and so often recalled, that if they\r\nthink they have been insulted they will show more resolution than other\r\npersons of the same rank." He looked at mademoiselle de la Mole in\r\norder to read the family plans in her eyes; she was pale and looked\r\nquite middle-aged. He thought that she had never looked so great: she\r\nwas really handsome and imposing; he almost fell in love with her.\r\n"_Pallida morte futura_," he said to himself (her pallor indicates\r\nher great plans). It was in vain that after dinner he made a point of\r\nwalking for a long time in the garden, mademoiselle did not appear.\r\nSpeaking to her at that moment would have lifted a great weight off his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nWhy not admit it? he was afraid. As he had resolved to act, he was not\r\nashamed to abandon himself to this emotion. "So long as I show the\r\nnecessary courage at the actual moment," he said to himself, "what\r\ndoes it matter what I feel at this particular moment?" He went to\r\nreconnoitre the situation and find out the weight of the ladder.\r\n\r\n"This is an instrument," he said to himself with a smile, "which I am\r\nfated to use both here and at Verri\xc3\xa8res. What a difference! In those\r\ndays," he added with a sigh, "I was not obliged to distrust the person\r\nfor whom I exposed myself to danger. What a difference also in the\r\ndanger!"\r\n\r\n"There would have been no dishonour for me if I had been killed in M.\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal\'s gardens. It would have been easy to have made my death into\r\na mystery. But here all kinds of abominable scandal will be talked in\r\nthe salons of the H\xc3\xb4tel de Chaulnes, the H\xc3\xb4tel de Caylus, de Retz,\r\netc., everywhere in fact. I shall go down to posterity as a monster."\r\n\r\n"For two or three years," he went on with a laugh, making fun of\r\nhimself; but the idea paralysed him. "And how am I going to manage to\r\nget justified? Suppose that Fouqu\xc3\xa9 does print my posthumous pamphlet,\r\nit will only be taken for an additional infamy. Why! I get received\r\ninto a house, and I reward the hospitality which I have received,\r\nthe kindness with which I have been loaded by printing a pamphlet\r\nabout what has happened and attacking the honour of women! Nay! I\'d a\r\nthousand times rather be duped."\r\n\r\nThe evening was awful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nONE O\'CLOCK IN THE MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\n        This garden was very big, it had been planned a\r\n        few years ago in perfect taste. But the trees were\r\n        more than a century old. It had a certain rustic\r\n        atmosphere.--_Massinger_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was going to write a countermanding letter to Fouqu\xc3\xa9 when eleven\r\no\'clock struck. He noisily turned the lock of the door of his room as\r\nthough he had locked himself in. He went with a sleuth-like step to\r\nobserve what was happening over the house, especially on the fourth\r\nstorey where the servants slept. There was nothing unusual. One of\r\nmadame de la Mole\'s chambermaids was giving an entertainment, the\r\nservants were taking punch with much gaiety. "Those who laugh like\r\nthat," thought Julien, "cannot be participating in the nocturnal\r\nexpedition; if they were, they would be more serious."\r\n\r\nEventually he stationed himself in an obscure corner of the garden. "If\r\ntheir plan is to hide themselves from the servants of the house, they\r\nwill despatch the persons whom they have told off to surprise me over\r\nthe garden wall.\r\n\r\n"If M. de Croisenois shows any sense of proportion in this matter, he\r\nis bound to find it less compromising for the young person, whom he\r\nwishes to make his wife if he has me surprised before I enter her room."\r\n\r\nHe made a military and extremely detailed reconnaissance. "My honour is\r\nat stake," he thought. "If I tumble into some pitfall it will not be an\r\nexcuse in my own eyes to say, \'I never thought of it.\'"\r\n\r\nThe weather was desperately serene. About eleven o\'clock the moon rose,\r\nat half-past twelve it completely illuminated the facade of the h\xc3\xb4tel\r\nlooking out upon the garden.\r\n\r\n"She is mad," Julien said to himself. As one o\'clock struck there\r\nwas still a light in comte Norbert\'s windows. Julien had never been\r\nso frightened in his life, he only saw the dangers of the enterprise\r\nand had no enthusiasm at all. He went and took the immense ladder,\r\nwaited five minutes to give her time to tell him not to go, and five\r\nminutes after one placed the ladder against Mathilde\'s window. He\r\nmounted softly, pistol in hand, astonished at not being attacked. As he\r\napproached the window it opened noiselessly.\r\n\r\n"So there you are, monsieur," said Mathilde to him with considerable\r\nemotion. "I have been following your movements for the last hour."\r\n\r\nJulien was very much embarrassed. He did not know how to conduct\r\nhimself. He did not feel at all in love. He thought in his\r\nembarrassment that he ought to be venturesome. He tried to kiss\r\nMathilde.\r\n\r\n"For shame," she said to him, pushing him away.\r\n\r\nExtremely glad at being rebuffed, he hastened to look round him. The\r\nmoon was so brilliant that the shadows which it made in mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole\'s room were black. "It\'s quite possible for men to be concealed\r\nwithout my seeing them," he thought.\r\n\r\n"What have you got in your pocket at the side of your coat?" Mathilde\r\nsaid to him, delighted at finding something to talk about. She was\r\nsuffering strangely; all those sentiments of reserve and timidity which\r\nwere so natural to a girl of good birth, had reasserted their dominion\r\nand were torturing her.\r\n\r\n"I have all kinds of arms and pistols," answered Julien equally glad at\r\nhaving something to say.\r\n\r\n"You must take the ladder away," said Mathilde.\r\n\r\n"It is very big, and may break the windows of the salon down below or\r\nthe room on the ground floor."\r\n\r\n"You must not break the windows," replied Mathilde making a vain effort\r\nto assume an ordinary conversational tone; "it seems to me you can\r\nlower the ladder by tying a cord to the first rung. I have always a\r\nsupply of cords at hand."\r\n\r\n"So this is a woman in love," thought Julien. "She actually dares to\r\nsay that she is in love. So much self-possession and such shrewdness in\r\ntaking precautions are sufficient indications that I am not triumphing\r\nover M. de Croisenois as I foolishly believed, but that I am simply\r\nsucceeding him. As a matter of fact, what does it matter to me? Do I\r\nlove her? I am triumphing over the marquis in so far as he would be\r\nvery angry at having a successor, and angrier still at that successor\r\nbeing myself. How haughtily he looked at me this evening in the Caf\xc3\xa9\r\nTortoni when he pretended not to recognise me! And how maliciously he\r\nbowed to me afterwards, when he could not get out of it."\r\n\r\nJulien had tied the cord to the last rung of the ladder. He lowered it\r\nsoftly and leant far out of the balcony in order to avoid its touching\r\nthe window pane. "A fine opportunity to kill me," he thought, "if\r\nanyone is hidden in Mathilde\'s room;" but a profound silence continued\r\nto reign everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe ladder touched the ground. Julien succeeded in laying it on the\r\nborder of the exotic flowers along side the wall.\r\n\r\n"What will my mother say," said Mathilde, "when she sees her beautiful\r\nplants all crushed? You must throw down the cord," she added with great\r\nself-possession. "If it were noticed going up to the balcony, it would\r\nbe a difficult circumstance to explain."\r\n\r\n"And how am I to get away?" said Julien in a jesting tone affecting the\r\nCreole accent. (One of the chambermaids of the household had been born\r\nin Saint-Domingo.)\r\n\r\n"You? Why you will leave by the door," said Mathilde, delighted at the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n"Ah! how worthy this man is of all my love," she thought.\r\n\r\nJulien had just let the cord fall into the garden; Mathilde grasped\r\nhis arm. He thought he had been seized by an enemy and turned round\r\nsharply, drawing a dagger. She had thought that she had heard a window\r\nopening. They remained motionless and scarcely breathed. The moonlight\r\nlit up everything. The noise was not renewed and there was no more\r\ncause for anxiety.\r\n\r\nThen their embarrassment began again; it was great on both sides.\r\nJulien assured himself that the door was completely locked; he thought\r\nof looking under the bed, but he did not dare; "they might have\r\nstationed one or two lackeys there." Finally he feared that he might\r\nreproach himself in the future for this lack of prudence, and did\r\nlook. Mathilde had fallen into all the anguish of the most extreme\r\ntimidity. She was horrified at her position.\r\n\r\n"What have you done with my letters?" she said at last.\r\n\r\n"What a good opportunity to upset these gentlemen, if they are\r\neavesdropping, and thus avoiding the battle," thought Julien.\r\n\r\n"The first is hid in a big Protestant Bible, which last night\'s\r\ndiligence is taking far away from here."\r\n\r\nHe spoke very distinctly as he went into these details, so as to be\r\nheard by any persons who might be concealed in two large mahogany\r\ncupboards which he had not dared to inspect.\r\n\r\n"The other two are in the post and are bound for the same destination\r\nas the first."\r\n\r\n"Heavens, why all these precautions?" said Mathilde in alarm.\r\n\r\n"What is the good of my lying?" thought Julien, and he confessed all\r\nhis suspicions.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s the cause for the coldness of your letters, dear," exclaimed\r\nMathilde in a tone of madness rather than of tenderness.\r\n\r\nJulien did not notice that nuance. The endearment made him lose his\r\nhead, or at any rate his suspicions vanished. He dared to clasp in his\r\narms that beautiful girl who inspired him with such respect. He was\r\nonly partially rebuffed. He fell back on his memory as he had once at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on with Armanda Binet, and recited by heart several of the finest\r\nphrases out of the _Nouvelle H\xc3\xa9loise_.\r\n\r\n"You have the heart of a man," was the answer she made without\r\nlistening too attentively to his phrases; "I wanted to test your\r\ncourage, I confess it. Your first suspicions and your resolutions show\r\nyou even more intrepid, dear, than I had believed."\r\n\r\nMathilde had to make an effort to call him "dear," and was evidently\r\npaying more attention to this strange method of speech than to\r\nthe substance of what she was saying. Being called "dear" without\r\nany tenderness in the tone afforded no pleasure to Julien; he was\r\nastonished at not being happy, and eventually fell back on his\r\nreasoning in order to be so. He saw that he was respected by this proud\r\nyoung girl who never gave undeserved praise; by means of this reasoning\r\nhe managed to enjoy the happiness of satisfied vanity. It was not,\r\nit was true, that soulful pleasure which he had sometimes found with\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal. There was no element of tenderness in the feelings\r\nof these first few minutes. It was the keen happiness of a gratified\r\nambition, and Julien was, above all, ambitious. He talked again of\r\nthe people whom he had suspected and of the precautions which he had\r\ndevised. As he spoke, he thought of the best means of exploiting his\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nMathilde was still very embarrassed and seemed paralysed by the\r\nsteps which she had taken. She appeared delighted to find a topic\r\nof conversation. They talked of how they were to see each other\r\nagain. Julien extracted a delicious joy from the consciousness of\r\nthe intelligence and the courage, of which he again proved himself\r\npossessed during this discussion. They had to reckon with extremely\r\nsharp people, the little Tanbeau was certainly a spy, but Mathilde and\r\nhimself as well had their share of cleverness.\r\n\r\nWhat was easier than to meet in the library, and there make all\r\narrangements?\r\n\r\n"I can appear in all parts of the h\xc3\xb4tel," added Julien, "without\r\nrousing suspicion almost, in fact, in madame de la Mole\'s own room."\r\nIt was absolutely necessary to go through it in order to reach her\r\ndaughter\'s room. If Mathilde thought it preferable for him always to\r\ncome by a ladder, then he would expose himself to that paltry danger\r\nwith a heart intoxicated with joy.\r\n\r\nAs she listened to him speaking, Mathilde was shocked by this air of\r\ntriumph. "So he is my master," she said to herself, she was already a\r\nprey to remorse. Her reason was horrified at the signal folly which she\r\nhad just committed. If she had had the power she would have annihilated\r\nboth herself and Julien. When for a few moments she managed by sheer\r\nwill-power to silence her pangs of remorse, she was rendered very\r\nunhappy by her timidity and wounded shame. She had quite failed to\r\nforesee the awful plight in which she now found herself.\r\n\r\n"I must speak to him, however," she said at last. "That is the proper\r\nthing to do. One does talk to one\'s lover." And then with a view of\r\naccomplishing a duty, and with a tenderness which was manifested rather\r\nin the words which she employed than in the inflection of her voice,\r\nshe recounted various resolutions which she had made concerning him\r\nduring the last few days.\r\n\r\nShe had decided that if he should dare to come to her room by the help\r\nof the gardener\'s ladder according to his instructions, she would be\r\nentirely his. But never were such tender passages spoken in a more\r\npolite and frigid tone. Up to the present this assignation had been\r\nicy. It was enough to make one hate the name of love. What a lesson\r\nin morality for a young and imprudent girl! Is it worth while to ruin\r\none\'s future for moments such as this?\r\n\r\nAfter long fits of hesitation which a superficial observer might have\r\nmistaken for the result of the most emphatic hate (so great is the\r\ndifficulty which a woman\'s self-respect finds in yielding even to so\r\nfirm a will as hers) Mathilde became eventually a charming mistress.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, these ecstasies were a little artificial. Passionate\r\nlove was still more the model which they imitated than a real actuality.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole thought she was fulfilling a duty towards\r\nherself and towards her lover. "The poor boy," she said to herself,\r\n"has shewn a consummate bravery. He deserves to be happy or it is\r\nreally I who will be shewing a lack of character." But she would have\r\nbeen glad to have redeemed the cruel necessity in which she found\r\nherself even at the price of an eternity of unhappiness.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the awful violence she was doing to herself she was\r\ncompletely mistress of her words.\r\n\r\nNo regret and no reproach spoiled that night which Julien found\r\nextraordinary rather than happy. Great heavens! what a difference to\r\nhis last twenty-four hours\' stay in Verri\xc3\xa8res. These fine Paris manners\r\nmanage to spoil everything, even love, he said to himself, quite\r\nunjustly.\r\n\r\nHe abandoned himself to these reflections as he stood upright in one of\r\nthe great mahogany cupboards into which he had been put at the sign of\r\nthe first sounds of movement in the neighbouring apartment, which was\r\nmadame de la Mole\'s. Mathilde followed her mother to mass, the servants\r\nsoon left the apartment and Julien easily escaped before they came back\r\nto finish their work.\r\n\r\nHe mounted a horse and tried to find the most solitary spots in one\r\nof the forests near Paris. He was more astonished than happy. The\r\nhappiness which filled his soul from time to time resembled that of a\r\nyoung sub-lieutenant who as the result of some surprising feat has just\r\nbeen made a full-fledged colonel by the commander-in-chief; he felt\r\nhimself lifted up to an immense height. Everything which was above him\r\nthe day before was now on a level with him or even below him. Little\r\nby little Julien\'s happiness increased in proportion as he got further\r\naway from Paris.\r\n\r\nIf there was no tenderness in his soul, the reason was that, however\r\nstrange it may appear to say so, Mathilde had in everything she had\r\ndone, simply accomplished a duty. The only thing she had not foreseen\r\nin all the events of that night, was the shame and unhappiness which\r\nshe had experienced instead of that absolute felicity which is found in\r\nnovels.\r\n\r\n"Can I have made a mistake, and not be in love with him?" she said to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nAN OLD SWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nI now mean to be serious; it is time\r\nSince laughter now-a-days is deemed too serious.\r\nA jest at vice by virtues called a crime.\r\n                             _Don Juan, c. xiii._\r\n\r\n\r\nShe did not appear at dinner. She came for a minute into the salon in\r\nthe evening, but did not look at Julien. He considered this behaviour\r\nstrange, "but," he thought, "I do not know their usages. She will give\r\nme some good reason for all this." None the less he was a prey to\r\nthe most extreme curiosity; he studied the expression of Mathilde\'s\r\nfeatures; he was bound to own to himself that she looked cold and\r\nmalicious. It was evidently not the same woman who on the proceeding\r\nnight had had, or pretended to have, transports of happiness which were\r\ntoo extravagant to be genuine.\r\n\r\nThe day after, and the subsequent day she showed the same coldness;\r\nshe did not look at him, she did not notice his existence. Julien was\r\ndevoured by the keenest anxiety and was a thousand leagues removed from\r\nthat feeling of triumph which had been his only emotion on the first\r\nday. "Can it be by chance," he said to himself, "a return to virtue?"\r\nBut this was a very bourgeois word to apply to the haughty Mathilde.\r\n\r\n"Placed in an ordinary position in life she would disbelieve in\r\nreligion," thought Julien, "she only likes it in so far as it is very\r\nuseful to the interests of her class."\r\n\r\nBut perhaps she may as a mere matter of delicacy be keenly reproaching\r\nherself for the mistake which she has committed. Julien believed that\r\nhe was her first lover.\r\n\r\n"But," he said to himself at other moments, "I must admit that there is\r\nno trace of naivety, simplicity, or tenderness in her own demeanour;\r\nI have never seen her more haughty, can she despise me? It would be\r\nworthy of her to reproach herself simply because of my low birth, for\r\nwhat she has done for me."\r\n\r\nWhile Julien, full of those preconceived ideas which he had found in\r\nbooks and in his memories of Verri\xc3\xa8res, was chasing the phantom of a\r\ntender mistress, who from the minute when she has made her lover happy\r\nno longer thinks of her own existence, Mathilde\'s vanity was infuriated\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nAs for the last two months she had no longer been bored, she was not\r\nfrightened of boredom; consequently, without being able to have the\r\nslightest suspicion of it, Julien had lost his greatest advantage.\r\n\r\n"I have given myself a master," said mademoiselle de la Mole to\r\nherself, a prey to the blackest sorrow. "Luckily he is honour itself,\r\nbut if I offend his vanity, he will revenge himself by making known\r\nthe nature of our relations." Mathilde had never had a lover, and\r\nthough passing through a stage of life which affords some tender\r\nillusions even to the coldest souls, she fell a prey to the most bitter\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\n"He has an immense dominion over me since his reign is one of terror,\r\nand he is capable, if I provoke him, of punishing me with an awful\r\npenalty." This idea alone was enough to induce mademoiselle de la\r\nMole to insult him. Courage was the primary quality in her character.\r\nThe only thing which could give her any thrill and cure her from a\r\nfundamental and chronically recurring ennui was the idea that she was\r\nstaking her entire existence on a single throw.\r\n\r\nAs mademoiselle de la Mole obstinately refused to look at him, Julien\r\non the third day in spite of her evident objection, followed her into\r\nthe billiard-room after dinner.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, you think you have acquired some very strong rights over\r\nme?" she said to him with scarcely controlled anger, "since you venture\r\nto speak to me, in spite of my very clearly manifested wish? Do you\r\nknow that no one in the world has had such effrontery?"\r\n\r\nThe dialogue of these two lovers was incomparably humourous. Without\r\nsuspecting it, they were animated by mutual sentiments of the most\r\nvivid hate. As neither the one nor the other had a meekly patient\r\ncharacter, while they were both disciples of good form, they soon came\r\nto informing each other quite clearly that they would break for ever.\r\n\r\n"I swear eternal secrecy to you," said Julien. "I should like to add\r\nthat I would never address a single word to you, were it not that a\r\nmarked change might perhaps jeopardise your reputation." He saluted\r\nrespectfully and left.\r\n\r\nHe accomplished easily enough what he believed to be a duty; he was\r\nvery far from thinking himself much in love with mademoiselle de la\r\nMole. He had certainly not loved her three days before, when he had\r\nbeen hidden in the big mahogany cupboard. But the moment that he found\r\nhimself estranged from her for ever his mood underwent a complete and\r\nrapid change.\r\n\r\nHis memory tortured him by going over the least details in that night,\r\nwhich had as a matter of fact left him so cold. In the very night that\r\nfollowed this announcement of a final rupture, Julien almost went mad\r\nat being obliged to own to himself that he loved mademoiselle de la\r\nMole.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was followed by awful struggles: all his emotions were\r\noverwhelmed.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, instead of being haughty towards M. de Croisenois, he\r\ncould have almost burst out into tears and embraced him.\r\n\r\nHis habituation to unhappiness gave him a gleam of commonsense, he\r\ndecided to leave for Languedoc, packed his trunk and went to the post.\r\n\r\nHe felt he would faint, when on arriving at the office of the mails, he\r\nwas told that by a singular chance there was a place in the Toulouse\r\nmail. He booked it and returned to the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole to announce his\r\ndeparture to the marquis.\r\n\r\nM. de la Mole had gone out. More dead than alive Julien went into\r\nthe library to wait for him. What was his emotion when he found\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole there.\r\n\r\nAs she saw him come, she assumed a malicious expression which it was\r\nimpossible to mistake.\r\n\r\nIn his unhappiness and surprise Julien lost his head and was weak\r\nenough to say to her in a tone of the most heartfelt tenderness. "So\r\nyou love me no more."\r\n\r\n"I am horrified at having given myself to the first man who came\r\nalong," said Mathilde crying with rage against herself.\r\n\r\n"The first man who came along," cried Julien, and he made for an old\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val sword which was kept in the library as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nHis grief--which he thought was at its maximum at the moment when he\r\nhad spoken to mademoiselle de la Mole--had been rendered a hundred\r\ntimes more intense by the tears of shame which he saw her shedding.\r\n\r\nHe would have been the happiest of men if he had been able to kill her.\r\n\r\nWhen he was on the point of drawing the sword with some difficulty from\r\nits ancient scabbard, Mathilde, rendered happy by so novel a sensation,\r\nadvanced proudly towards him, her tears were dry.\r\n\r\nThe thought of his benefactor--the marquis de la Mole--presented\r\nitself vividly to Julien. "Shall I kill his daughter?" he said to\r\nhimself, "how horrible." He made a movement to throw down the sword.\r\n"She will certainly," he thought, "burst out laughing at the sight of\r\nsuch a melodramatic pose:" that idea was responsible for his regaining\r\nall his self-possession. He looked curiously at the blade of the old\r\nsword as though he had been looking for some spot of rust, then put it\r\nback in the scabbard and replaced it with the utmost tranquillity on\r\nthe gilt bronze nail from which it hung.\r\n\r\nThe whole man\xc5\x93uvre, which towards the end was very slow, lasted quite\r\na minute; mademoiselle de la Mole looked at him in astonishment. "So\r\nI have been on the verge of being killed by my lover," she said to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThis idea transported her into the palmiest days of the age of Charles\r\nIX. and of Henri III.\r\n\r\nShe stood motionless before Julien, who had just replaced the sword;\r\nshe looked at him with eyes whose hatred had disappeared. It must be\r\nowned that she was very fascinating at this moment, certainly no woman\r\nlooked less like a Parisian doll (this expression symbolised Julien\'s\r\ngreat objection to the women of this city).\r\n\r\n"I shall relapse into some weakness for him," thought Mathilde; "it\r\nis quite likely that he will think himself my lord and master after a\r\nrelapse like that at the very moment that I have been talking to him so\r\nfirmly." She ran away.\r\n\r\n"By heaven, she is pretty said Julien as he watched her run and that\'s\r\nthe creature who threw herself into my arms with so much passion\r\nscarcely a week ago ... and to think that those moments will never\r\ncome back? And that it\'s my fault, to think of my being lacking\r\nin appreciation at the very moment when I was doing something so\r\nextraordinarily interesting! I must own that I was born with a very\r\ndull and unfortunate character."\r\n\r\nThe marquis appeared; Julien hastened to announce his departure.\r\n\r\n"Where to?" said M. de la Mole.\r\n\r\n"For Languedoc."\r\n\r\n"No, if you please, you are reserved for higher destinies. If you leave\r\nit will be for the North.... In military phraseology I actually confine\r\nyou in the hotel. You will compel me to be never more than two or three\r\nhours away. I may have need of you at any moment."\r\n\r\nJulien bowed and retired without a word, leaving the marquis in a state\r\nof great astonishment. He was incapable of speaking. He shut himself\r\nup in his room. He was there free to exaggerate to himself all the\r\nawfulness of his fate.\r\n\r\n"So," he thought, "I cannot even get away. God knows how many days\r\nthe marquis will keep me in Paris. Great God, what will become of me,\r\nand not a friend whom I can consult? The abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard will never let\r\nme finish my first sentence, while the comte Altamira will propose\r\nenlisting me in some conspiracy. And yet I am mad; I feel it, I am mad.\r\nWho will be able to guide me, what will become of me?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nCRUEL MOMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n        And she confesses it to me! She goes into even\r\n        the smallest details! Her beautiful eyes fixed on\r\n        mine, and describes the love which she felt for\r\n        another.--_Schiller_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe delighted mademoiselle de la Mole thought of nothing but the\r\nhappiness of having been nearly killed. She went so far as to say to\r\nherself, "he is worthy of being my master since he was on the point of\r\nkilling me. How many handsome young society men would have to be melted\r\ntogether before they were capable of so passionate a transport."\r\n\r\n"I must admit that he was very handsome at the time when he climbed up\r\non the chair to replace the sword in the same picturesque position in\r\nwhich the decorator hung it! After all it was not so foolish of me to\r\nlove him."\r\n\r\nIf at that moment some honourable means of reconciliation had presented\r\nitself, she would have embraced it with pleasure. Julien locked in his\r\nroom was a prey to the most violent despair. He thought in his madness\r\nof throwing himself at her feet. If instead of hiding himself in an out\r\nof the way place, he had wandered about the garden of the h\xc3\xb4tel so as\r\nto keep within reach of any opportunity, he would perhaps have changed\r\nin a single moment his awful unhappiness into the keenest happiness.\r\n\r\nBut the tact for whose lack we are now reproaching him would have been\r\nincompatible with that sublime seizure of the sword, which at the\r\npresent time rendered him so handsome in the eyes of mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole. This whim in Julien\'s favour lasted the whole day; Mathilde\r\nconjured up a charming image of the short moments during which she had\r\nloved him: she regretted them.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact," she said to herself, "my passion for this poor\r\nboy can from his point of view only have lasted from one hour after\r\nmidnight when I saw him arrive by his ladder with all his pistols in\r\nhis coat pocket, till eight o\'clock in the morning. It was a quarter of\r\nan hour after that as I listened to mass at Sainte-Val\xc3\xa8re that I began\r\nto think that he might very well try to terrify me into obedience."\r\n\r\nAfter dinner mademoiselle de la Mole, so far from avoiding Julien,\r\nspoke to him and made him promise to follow her into the garden. He\r\nobeyed. It was a new experience.\r\n\r\nWithout suspecting it Mathilde was yielding to the love which she was\r\nnow feeling for him again. She found an extreme pleasure in walking by\r\nhis side, and she looked curiously at those hands which had seized the\r\nsword to kill her that very morning.\r\n\r\nAfter such an action, after all that had taken place, some of the\r\nformer conversation was out of the question.\r\n\r\nMathilde gradually began to talk confidentially to him about the\r\nstate of her heart. She found a singular pleasure in this kind of\r\nconversation, she even went so far as to describe to him the fleeting\r\nmoments of enthusiasm which she had experienced for M. de Croisenois,\r\nfor M. de Caylus----\r\n\r\n"What! M. de Caylus as well!" exclaimed Julien, and all the jealousy of\r\na discarded lover burst out in those words, Mathilde thought as much,\r\nbut did not feel at all insulted.\r\n\r\nShe continued torturing Julien by describing her former sentiments with\r\nthe most picturesque detail and the accent of the most intimate truth.\r\nHe saw that she was portraying what she had in her mind\'s eye. He had\r\nthe pain of noticing that as she spoke she made new discoveries in her\r\nown heart.\r\n\r\nThe unhappiness of jealousy could not be carried further.\r\n\r\nIt is cruel enough to suspect that a rival is loved, but there is no\r\ndoubt that to hear the woman one adores confess in detail the love\r\nwhich rivals inspires, is the utmost limit of anguish.\r\n\r\nOh, how great a punishment was there now for those impulses of pride\r\nwhich had induced Julien to place himself as superior to the Caylus\r\nand the Croisenois! How deeply did he feel his own unhappiness as he\r\nexaggerated to himself their most petty advantages. With what hearty\r\ngood faith he despised himself.\r\n\r\nMathilde struck him as adorable. All words are weak to express his\r\nexcessive admiration. As he walked beside her he looked surreptitiously\r\nat her hands, her arms, her queenly bearing. He was so completely\r\novercome by love and unhappiness as to be on the point of falling at\r\nher feet and crying "pity."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and that person who is so beautiful, who is so superior to\r\neverything and who loved me once, will doubtless soon love M. de\r\nCaylus."\r\n\r\nJulien could have no doubts of mademoiselle de la Mole\'s sincerity,\r\nthe accent of truth was only too palpable in everything she said. In\r\norder that nothing might be wanting to complete his unhappiness there\r\nwere moments when, as a result of thinking about the sentiments which\r\nshe had once experienced for M. de Caylus, Mathilde came to talk of\r\nhim, as though she loved him at the present time. She certainly put an\r\ninflection of love into her voice. Julien distinguished it clearly.\r\n\r\nHe would have suffered less if his bosom had been filled inside with\r\nmolten lead. Plunged as he was in this abyss of unhappiness how could\r\nthe poor boy have guessed that it was simply because she was talking to\r\nhim, that mademoiselle de la Mole found so much pleasure in recalling\r\nthose weaknesses of love which she had formerly experienced for M. de\r\nCaylus or M. de Luz.\r\n\r\nWords fail to express Julien\'s anguish. He listened to these detailed\r\nconfidences of the love she had experienced for others in that very\r\navenue of pines where he had waited so few days ago for one o\'clock\r\nto strike that he might invade her room. No human being can undergo a\r\ngreater degree of unhappiness.\r\n\r\nThis kind of familiar cruelty lasted for eight long days. Mathilde\r\nsometimes seemed to seek opportunities of speaking to him and sometimes\r\nnot to avoid them; and the one topic of conversation to which they both\r\nseemed to revert with a kind of cruel pleasure, was the description of\r\nthe sentiments she had felt for others. She told him about the letters\r\nwhich she had written, she remembered their very words, she recited\r\nwhole sentences by heart.\r\n\r\nShe seemed during these last days to be envisaging Julien with a kind\r\nof malicious joy. She found a keen enjoyment in his pangs.\r\n\r\nOne sees that Julien had no experience of life; he had not even read\r\nany novels. If he had been a little less awkward and he had coolly said\r\nto the young girl, whom he adored so much and who had been giving him\r\nsuch strange confidences: "admit that though I am not worth as much as\r\nall these gentlemen, I am none the less the man whom you loved," she\r\nwould perhaps have been happy at being at thus guessed; at any rate\r\nsuccess would have entirely depended on the grace with which Julien had\r\nexpressed the idea, and on the moment which he had chosen to do so. In\r\nany case he would have extricated himself well and advantageously from\r\na situation which Mathilde was beginning to find monotonous.\r\n\r\n"And you love me no longer, me, who adores you!" said Julien to her one\r\nday, overcome by love and unhappiness. This piece of folly was perhaps\r\nthe greatest which he could have committed. These words immediately\r\ndestroyed all the pleasure which mademoiselle de la Mole found in\r\ntalking to him about the state of her heart. She was beginning to be\r\nsurprised that he did not, after what had happened, take offence at\r\nwhat she told him. She had even gone so far as to imagine at the very\r\nmoment when he made that foolish remark that perhaps he did not love\r\nher any more. "His pride has doubtless extinguished his love," she was\r\nsaying to herself. "He is not the man to sit still and see people like\r\nCaylus, de Luz, Croisenois whom he admits are so superior, preferred to\r\nhim. No, I shall never see him at my feet again."\r\n\r\nJulien had often in the naivety of his unhappiness, during the previous\r\ndays praised sincerely the brilliant qualities of these gentlemen; he\r\nwould even go so far as to exaggerate them. This nuance had not escaped\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole, she was astonished by it, but did not guess\r\nits reason. Julien\'s frenzied soul, in praising a rival whom he thought\r\nwas loved, was sympathising with his happiness.\r\n\r\nThese frank but stupid words changed everything in a single moment;\r\nconfident that she was loved, Mathilde despised him utterly.\r\n\r\nShe was walking with him when he made his ill-timed remark; she left\r\nhim, and her parting look expressed the most awful contempt. She\r\nreturned to the salon and did not look at him again during the whole\r\nevening. This contempt monopolised her mind the following day. The\r\nimpulse which during the last week had made her find so much pleasure\r\nin treating Julien as her most intimate friend was out of the question;\r\nthe very sight of him was disagreeable. The sensation Mathilde felt\r\nreached the point of disgust; nothing can express the extreme contempt\r\nwhich she experienced when her eyes fell upon him.\r\n\r\nJulien had understood nothing of the history of Mathilde\'s heart during\r\nthe last week, but he distinguished the contempt. He had the good sense\r\nonly to appear before her on the rarest possible occasions, and never\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\nBut it was not without a mortal anguish that he, as it were, deprived\r\nhimself of her presence. He thought he felt his unhappiness increasing\r\nstill further. "The courage of a man\'s heart cannot be carried\r\nfurther," he said to himself. He passed his life seated at a little\r\nwindow at the top of the h\xc3\xb4tel; the blind was carefully closed, and\r\nfrom here at any rate he could see mademoiselle de la Mole when she\r\nappeared in the garden.\r\n\r\nWhat were his emotions when he saw her walking after dinner with M. de\r\nCaylus, M. de Luz, or some other for whom she had confessed to him some\r\nformer amorous weakness!\r\n\r\nJulien had no idea that unhappiness could be so intense; he was on\r\nthe point of shouting out. This firm soul was at last completely\r\noverwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThinking about anything else except mademoiselle de la Mole had become\r\nodious to him; he became incapable of writing the simplest letters.\r\n\r\n"You are mad," the marquis said to him.\r\n\r\nJulien was frightened that his secret might be guessed, talked\r\nabout illness and succeeded in being believed. Fortunately for him\r\nthe marquis rallied him at dinner about his next journey; Mathilde\r\nunderstood that it might be a very long one. It was now several days\r\nthat Julien had avoided her, and the brilliant young men who had all\r\nthat this pale sombre being she had once loved was lacking, had no\r\nlonger the power of drawing her out of her reverie.\r\n\r\n"An ordinary girl," she said to herself, "would have sought out the man\r\nshe preferred among those young people who are the cynosure of a salon;\r\nbut one of the characteristics of genius is not to drive its thoughts\r\nover the rut traced by the vulgar.\r\n\r\n"Why, if I were the companion of a man like Julien, who only lacks the\r\nfortune that I possess, I should be continually exciting attention, I\r\nshould not pass through life unnoticed. Far from incessantly fearing\r\na revolution like my cousins who are so frightened of the people that\r\nthey have not the pluck to scold a postillion who drives them badly, I\r\nshould be certain of playing a r\xc3\xb4le and a great r\xc3\xb4le, for the man whom\r\nI have chosen has a character and a boundless ambition. What does he\r\nlack? Friends, money? I will give them him." But she treated Julien in\r\nher thought as an inferior being whose love one could win whenever one\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nTHE OPERA BOUFFE\r\n\r\n\r\n    How the spring of love resembleth\r\n    The uncertain glory of an April day,\r\n    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,\r\n    And by and by a cloud takes all away.--_Shakespeare_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngrossed by thoughts of her future and the singular r\xc3\xb4le which\r\nshe hoped to play, Mathilde soon came to miss the dry metaphysical\r\nconversations which she had often had with Julien. Fatigued by\r\nthese lofty thoughts she would sometimes also miss those moments of\r\nhappiness which she had found by his side; these last memories were not\r\nunattended by remorse which at certain times even overwhelmed her.\r\n\r\n"But one may have a weakness," she said to herself, "a girl like I am\r\nshould only forget herself for a man of real merit; they will not say\r\nthat it is his pretty moustache or his skill in horsemanship which have\r\nfascinated me, but rather his deep discussions on the future of France\r\nand his ideas on the analogy between the events which are going to\r\nburst upon us and the English revolution of 1688."\r\n\r\n"I have been seduced," she answered in her remorse. "I am a weak\r\nwoman, but at least I have not been led astray like a doll by exterior\r\nadvantages."\r\n\r\n"If there is a revolution why should not Julien Sorel play the r\xc3\xb4le of\r\nRoland and I the r\xc3\xb4le of Madame Roland? I prefer that part to Madame de\r\nStael\'s; the immorality of my conduct will constitute an obstacle in\r\nthis age of ours. I will certainly not let them reproach me with an act\r\nof weakness; I should die of shame."\r\n\r\nMathilde\'s reveries were not all as grave, one must admit, as the\r\nthoughts which we have just transcribed.\r\n\r\nShe would look at Julien and find a charming grace in his slightest\r\naction.\r\n\r\n"I have doubtless," she would say, "succeeded in destroying in him the\r\nvery faintest idea he had of any one else\'s rights."\r\n\r\n"The air of unhappiness and deep passion with which the poor boy\r\ndeclared his love to me eight days ago proves it; I must own it was\r\nvery extraordinary of me to manifest anger at words in which there\r\nshone so much respect and so much of passion. Am I not his real wife?\r\nThose words of his were quite natural, and I must admit, were really\r\nvery nice. Julien still continued to love me, even after those eternal\r\nconversations in which I had only spoken to him (cruelly enough I\r\nadmit), about those weaknesses of love which the boredom of the life\r\nI lead had inspired me for those young society men of whom he is so\r\njealous. Ah, if he only knew what little danger I have to fear from\r\nthem; how withered and stereotyped they seem to me in comparison with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nWhile indulging in these reflections Mathilde made a random pencil\r\nsketch of a profile on a page of her album. One of the profiles she\r\nhad just finished surprised and delighted her. It had a striking\r\nresemblance to Julien. "It is the voice of heaven. That\'s one of the\r\nmiracles of love," she cried ecstatically; "Without suspecting it, I\r\nhave drawn his portrait."\r\n\r\nShe fled to her room, shut herself up in it, and with much application\r\nmade strenuous endeavours to draw Julien\'s portrait, but she was unable\r\nto succeed; the profile she had traced at random still remained the\r\nmost like him. Mathilde was delighted with it. She saw in it a palpable\r\nproof of the grand passion.\r\n\r\nShe only left her album very late when the marquise had her called to\r\ngo to the Italian Opera. Her one idea was to catch sight of Julien, so\r\nthat she might get her mother to request him to keep them company.\r\n\r\nHe did not appear, and the ladies had only ordinary vulgar creatures in\r\ntheir box. During the first act of the opera, Mathilde dreamt of the\r\nman she loved with all the ecstasies of the most vivid passion; but a\r\nlove-maxim in the second act sung it must be owned to a melody worthy\r\nof Cimarosa pierced her heart. The heroine of the opera said "You must\r\npunish me for the excessive adoration which I feel for him. I love him\r\ntoo much."\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that Mathilde heard this sublime song everything in\r\nthe world ceased to exist. She was spoken to, she did not answer; her\r\nmother reprimanded her, she could scarcely bring herself to look at\r\nher. Her ecstasy reached a state of exultation and passion analogous\r\nto the most violent transports which Julien had felt for her for some\r\ndays. The divinely graceful melody to which the maxim, which seemed\r\nto have such a striking application to her own position, was sung,\r\nengrossed all the minutes when she was not actually thinking of Julien.\r\nThanks to her love for music she was on this particular evening like\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal always was, when she thought of Julien. Love of the\r\nhead has doubtless more intelligence than true love, but it only has\r\nmoments of enthusiasm. It knows itself too well, it sits in judgment on\r\nitself incessantly; far from distracting thought it is made by sheer\r\nforce of thought.\r\n\r\nOn returning home Mathilde, in spite of madame de la Mole\'s\r\nremonstrances, pretended to have a fever and spent a part of the night\r\nin going over this melody on her piano. She sang the words of the\r\ncelebrated air which had so fascinated her:--\r\n\r\n     Devo punirmi, devo punirmi.\r\n     Se troppo amai, etc.\r\n\r\nAs the result of this night of madness, she imagined that she had\r\nsucceeded in triumphing over her love. This page will be prejudicial\r\nin more than one way to the unfortunate author. Frigid souls will\r\naccuse him of indecency. But the young ladies who shine in the Paris\r\nsalons have no right to feel insulted at the supposition that one of\r\ntheir number might be liable to those transports of madness which have\r\nbeen degrading the character of Mathilde. That character is purely\r\nimaginary, and is even drawn quite differently from that social code\r\nwhich will guarantee so distinguished a place in the world\'s history to\r\nnineteenth century civilization.\r\n\r\nThe young girls who have adorned this winter\'s balls are certainly not\r\nlacking in prudence.\r\n\r\nI do not think either that they can be accused of being unduly scornful\r\nof a brilliant fortune, horses, fine estates and all the guarantees\r\nof a pleasant position in society. Far from finding these advantages\r\nsimply equivalent to boredom, they usually concentrate on them their\r\nmost constant desires and and devote to them such passion as their\r\nhearts possess.\r\n\r\nNor again is it love which is the dominant principle in the career of\r\nyoung men who, like Julien, are gifted with some talent; they attach\r\nthemselves with an irresistible grip to some c\xc3\xb4terie, and when the\r\nc\xc3\xb4terie succeeds all the good things of society are rained upon them.\r\nWoe to the studious man who belongs to no c\xc3\xb4terie, even his smallest\r\nand most doubtful successes will constitute a grievance, and lofty\r\nvirtue will rob him and triumph. Yes, monsieur, a novel is a mirror\r\nwhich goes out on a highway. Sometimes it reflects the azure of the\r\nheavens, sometimes the mire of the pools of mud on the way, and the\r\nman who carries this mirror in his knapsack is forsooth to be accused\r\nby you of being immoral! His mirror shows the mire, and you accuse the\r\nmirror! Rather accuse the main road where the mud is, or rather the\r\ninspector of roads who allows the water to accumulate and the mud to\r\nform.\r\n\r\nNow that it is quite understood that Mathilde\'s character is impossible\r\nin our own age, which is as discreet as it is virtuous, I am less\r\nfrightened of offence by continuing the history of the follies of this\r\ncharming girl.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the following day she looked out for opportunities\r\nof convincing herself of her triumph over her mad passion. Her great\r\naim was to displease Julien in everything; but not one of his movements\r\nescaped her.\r\n\r\nJulien was too unhappy, and above all too agitated to appreciate so\r\ncomplicated a stratagem of passion. Still less was he capable of\r\nseeing how favourable it really was to him. He was duped by it. His\r\nunhappiness had perhaps never been so extreme. His actions were so\r\nlittle controlled by his intellect that if some mournful philosopher\r\nhad said to him, "Think how to exploit as quickly as you can those\r\nsymptoms which promise to be favourable to you. In this kind of\r\nhead-love which is seen at Paris, the same mood cannot last more than\r\ntwo days," he would not have understood him. But however ecstatic he\r\nmight feel, Julien was a man of honour. Discretion was his first duty.\r\nHe appreciated it. Asking advice, describing his agony to the first\r\nman who came along would have constituted a happiness analogous to\r\nthat of the unhappy man who, when traversing a burning desert receives\r\nfrom heaven a drop of icy water. He realised the danger, was frightened\r\nof answering an indiscreet question by a torrent of tears, and shut\r\nhimself up in his own room.\r\n\r\nHe saw Mathilde walking in the garden for a long time. When she at last\r\nleft it, he went down there and approached the rose bush from which she\r\nhad taken a flower.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark and he could abandon himself to his unhappiness\r\nwithout fear of being seen. It was obvious to him that mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole loved one of those young officers with whom she had chatted so\r\ngaily. She had loved him, but she had realised his little merit, "and\r\nas a matter of fact I had very little," Julien said to himself with\r\nfull conviction. "Taking me all round I am a very dull, vulgar person,\r\nvery boring to others and quite unbearable to myself." He was mortally\r\ndisgusted with all his good qualities, and with all the things which he\r\nhad once loved so enthusiastically; and it was when his imagination was\r\nin this distorted condition that he undertook to judge life by means of\r\nits aid. This mistake is typical of a superior man.\r\n\r\nThe idea of suicide presented itself to him several times; the idea was\r\nfull of charm, and like a delicious rest; because it was the glass of\r\niced water offered to the wretch dying of thirst and heat in the desert.\r\n\r\n"My death will increase the contempt she has for me," he exclaimed.\r\n"What a memory I should leave her."\r\n\r\nCourage is the only resource of a human being who has fallen into this\r\nlast abyss of unhappiness. Julien did not have sufficient genius to say\r\nto himself, "I must dare," but as he looked at the window of Mathilde\'s\r\nroom he saw through the blinds that she was putting out her light. He\r\nconjured up that charming room which he had seen, alas! once in his\r\nwhole life. His imagination did not go any further.\r\n\r\nOne o\'clock struck. Hearing the stroke of the clock and saying to\r\nhimself, "I will climb up the ladder," scarcely took a moment.\r\n\r\nIt was the flash of genius, good reasons crowded on his mind. "May I be\r\nmore fortunate than before," he said to himself. He ran to the ladder.\r\nThe gardener had chained it up. With the help of the cock of one of\r\nhis little pistols which he broke, Julien, who for the time being was\r\nanimated by a superhuman force, twisted one of the links of the chain\r\nwhich held the ladder. He was master of it in a few minutes, and placed\r\nit against Mathilde\'s window.\r\n\r\n"She will be angry and riddle me with scornful words! What does it\r\nmatter? I will give her a kiss, one last kiss. I will go up to my room\r\nand kill myself ... my lips will touch her cheek before I die."\r\n\r\nHe flew up the ladder and knocked at the blind; Mathilde heard him\r\nafter some minutes and tried to open the blind but the ladder was in\r\nthe way. Julien hung to the iron hook intending to keep the blind open,\r\nand at the imminent risk of falling down, gave the ladder a violent\r\nshake which moved it a little. Mathilde was able to open the blind.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself into the window more dead than alive.\r\n\r\n"So it is you, dear," she said as she rushed into his arms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe excess of Julien\'s happiness was indescribable. Mathilde\'s almost\r\nequalled his own.\r\n\r\nShe talked against herself to him and denounced herself.\r\n\r\n"Punish me for my awful pride," she said to him, clasping him in her\r\narms so tightly as almost to choke him. "You are my master, dear, I\r\nam your slave. I must ask your pardon on my knees for having tried to\r\nrebel." She left his arms to fall at his feet. "Yes," she said to him,\r\nstill intoxicated with happiness and with love, "you are my master,\r\nreign over me for ever. When your slave tries to revolt, punish her\r\nseverely."\r\n\r\nIn another moment she tore herself from his arms, and lit a candle,\r\nand it was only by a supreme effort that Julien could prevent her from\r\ncutting off a whole tress of her hair.\r\n\r\n"I want to remind myself," she said to him, "that I am your handmaid.\r\nIf I am ever led astray again by my abominable pride, show me this hair\r\nand say, \'It is not a question of the emotion which your soul may be\r\nfeeling at present, you have sworn to obey, obey on your honour.\'"\r\n\r\nBut it is wiser to suppress the description of so intense a transport\r\nof delirious happiness.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s unselfishness was equal to his happiness. "I must go down by\r\nthe ladder," he said to Mathilde, when he saw the dawn of day appear\r\nfrom the quarter of the east over the distant chimneys beyond the\r\ngarden. "The sacrifice that I impose on myself is worthy of you. I\r\ndeprive myself of some hours of the most astonishing happiness that a\r\nhuman soul can savour, but it is a sacrifice I make for the sake of\r\nyour reputation. If you know my heart you will appreciate how violent\r\nis the strain to which I am putting myself. Will you always be to me\r\nwhat you are now? But honour speaks, it suffices. Let me tell you that\r\nsince our last interview, thieves have not been the only object of\r\nsuspicion. M. de la Mole has set a guard in the garden. M. Croisenois\r\nis surrounded by spies: they know what he does every night."\r\n\r\nMathilde burst out laughing at this idea. Her mother and a chamber-maid\r\nwere woken up, they suddenly began to speak to her through the door.\r\nJulien looked at her, she grew pale as she scolded the chamber-maid,\r\nand she did not deign to speak to her mother. "But suppose they think\r\nof opening the window, they will see the ladder," Julien said to her.\r\n\r\nHe clasped her again in his arms, rushed on to the ladder, and slid,\r\nrather than climbed down; he was on the ground in a moment.\r\n\r\nThree seconds after the ladder was in the avenue of pines, and\r\nMathilde\'s honour was saved. Julien returned to his room and found that\r\nhe was bleeding and almost naked. He had wounded himself in sliding\r\ndown in that dare-devil way.\r\n\r\nExtreme happiness had made him regain all the energy of his character.\r\nIf twenty men had presented themselves it would have proved at this\r\nmoment only an additional pleasure to have attacked them unaided.\r\nHappily his military prowess was not put to the proof. He laid the\r\nladder in its usual place and replaced the chain which held it. He did\r\nnot forget to efface the mark which the ladder had left on the bed of\r\nexotic flowers under Mathilde\'s window.\r\n\r\nAs he was moving his hand over the soft ground in the darkness and\r\nsatisfying himself that the mark had entirely disappeared, he felt\r\nsomething fall down on his hands. It was a whole tress of Mathilde\'s\r\nhair which she had cut off and thrown down to him.\r\n\r\nShe was at the window.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what your servant sends you," she said to him in a fairly loud\r\nvoice, "It is the sign of eternal gratitude. I renounce the exercise of\r\nmy reason, be my master."\r\n\r\nJulien was quite overcome and was on the point of going to fetch the\r\nladder again and climbing back into her room. Finally reason prevailed.\r\n\r\nGetting back into the h\xc3\xb4tel from the garden was not easy. He succeeded\r\nin forcing the door of a cellar. Once in the house he was obliged to\r\nbreak through the door of his room as silently as possible. In his\r\nagitation he had left in the little room which he had just abandoned so\r\nrapidly, the key which was in the pocket of his coat. "I only hope she\r\nthinks of hiding that fatal trophy," he thought.\r\n\r\nFinally fatigue prevailed over happiness, and as the sun was rising he\r\nfell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast bell only just managed to wake him up. He appeared in the\r\ndining-room. Shortly afterwards Mathilde came in. Julien\'s pride felt\r\ndeliciously flattered as he saw the love which shone in the eyes of\r\nthis beautiful creature who was surrounded by so much homage; but soon\r\nhis discretion had occasion to be alarmed.\r\n\r\nMaking an excuse of the little time that she had had to do her hair,\r\nMathilde had arranged it in such a way that Julien could see at the\r\nfirst glance the full extent of the sacrifice that she had made for his\r\nsake, by cutting off her hair on the previous night.\r\n\r\nIf it had been possible to spoil so beautiful a face by anything\r\nwhatsoever, Mathilde would have succeeded in doing it. A whole tress\r\nof her beautiful blonde hair was cut off to within half an inch of the\r\nscalp.\r\n\r\nMathilde\'s whole manner during breakfast was in keeping with this\r\ninitial imprudence. One might have said that she had made a specific\r\npoint of trying to inform the whole world of her mad passion for\r\nJulien. Happily on this particular day M. de la Mole and the marquis\r\nwere very much concerned about an approaching bestowal of "blue\r\nribbons" which was going to take place, and in which M. de Chaulnes was\r\nnot comprised. Towards the end of the meal, Mathilde, who was talking\r\nto Julien, happened to call him "My Master." He blushed up to the\r\nwhites of his eyes.\r\n\r\nMathilde was not left alone for an instant that day, whether by chance\r\nor the deliberate policy of madame de la Mole. In the evening when she\r\npassed from the dining-room into the salon, however, she managed to say\r\nto Julien: "You may be thinking I am making an excuse, but mamma has\r\njust decided that one of her women is to spend the night in my room."\r\n\r\nThis day passed with lightning rapidity. Julien was at the zenith of\r\nhappiness. At seven o\'clock in the morning of the following day he\r\ninstalled himself in the library. He hoped the mademoiselle de la Mole\r\nwould deign to appear there; he had written her an interminable letter.\r\nHe only saw her several hours afterwards at breakfast. Her hair was\r\ndone to-day with the very greatest care; a marvellous art had managed\r\nto hide the place where the hair had been cut. She looked at Julien\r\nonce or twice, but her eyes were polite and calm, and there was no\r\nquestion of calling him "My Master."\r\n\r\nJulien\'s astonishment prevented him from breathing--Mathilde was\r\nreproaching herself for all she had done for him. After mature\r\nreflection, she had come to the conclusion that he was a person who,\r\nthough not absolutely commonplace, was yet not sufficiently different\r\nfrom the common ruck to deserve all the strange follies that she\r\nhad ventured for his sake. To sum up she did not give love a single\r\nthought; on this particular day she was tired of loving.\r\n\r\nAs for Julien, his emotions were those of a child of sixteen. He was a\r\nsuccessive prey to awful doubt, astonishment and despair during this\r\nbreakfast which he thought would never end.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could decently get up from the table, he flew rather than\r\nran to the stable, saddled his horse himself, and galloped off. "I\r\nmust kill my heart through sheer force of physical fatigue," he said\r\nto himself as he galloped through the Meudon woods. "What have I done,\r\nwhat have I said to deserve a disgrace like this?"\r\n\r\n"I must do nothing and say nothing to-day," he thought as he re-entered\r\nthe h\xc3\xb4tel. "I must be as dead physically as I am morally." Julien saw\r\nnothing any more, it was only his corpse which kept moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nTHE JAPANESE VASE\r\n\r\n\r\n        His heart does not first realise the full extremity of\r\n        his unhappiness: he is more troubled than moved. But as\r\n        reason returns he feels the depth of his misfortune. All\r\n        the pleasures of life seem to have been destroyed, he\r\n        can only feel the sharp barbs of a lacerating despair.\r\n        But what is the use of talking of physical pain? What\r\n        pain which is only felt by the body can be compared to\r\n        this pain?--_Jean Paul_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dinner bell rang, Julien had barely time to dress: he found\r\nMathilde in the salon. She was pressing her brother and M. de\r\nCroisenois to promise her that they would not go and spend the evening\r\nat Suresnes with madame the mar\xc3\xa9chale de Fervaques.\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult to have shown herself more amiable or\r\nfascinating to them. M. de Luz, de Caylus and several of their friends\r\ncame in after dinner. One would have said that mademoiselle de la Mole\r\nhad commenced again to cultivate the most scrupulous conventionality\r\nat the same time as her sisterly affection. Although the weather was\r\ndelightful this evening, she refused to go out into the garden, and\r\ninsisted on their all staying near the arm-chair where madame de la\r\nMole was sitting. The blue sofa was the centre of the group as it had\r\nbeen in the winter.\r\n\r\nMathilde was out of temper with the garden, or at any rate she found it\r\nabsolutely boring: it was bound up with the memory of Julien.\r\n\r\nUnhappiness blunts the edge of the intellect. Our hero had the bad\r\ntaste to stop by that little straw chair which had formerly witnessed\r\nhis most brilliant triumphs. To-day none spoke to him, his presence\r\nseemed to be unnoticed, and worse than that. Those of mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole\'s friends who were sitting near him at the end of the sofa,\r\nmade a point of somehow or other turning their back on him, at any rate\r\nhe thought so.\r\n\r\n"It is a court disgrace," he thought. He tried to study for a moment\r\nthe people who were endeavouring to overwhelm him with their contempt.\r\nM. de Luz had an important post in the King\'s suite, the result of\r\nwhich was that the handsome officer began every conversation with\r\nevery listener who came along by telling him this special piece of\r\ninformation. His uncle had started at seven o\'clock for St. Cloud\r\nand reckoned on spending the night there. This detail was introduced\r\nwith all the appearance of good nature but it never failed to be\r\nworked in. As Julien scrutinized M. de Croisenois with a stern gaze of\r\nunhappiness, he observed that this good amiable young man attributed\r\na great influence to occult causes. He even went so far as to become\r\nmelancholy and out of temper if he saw an event of the slightest\r\nimportance ascribed to a simple and perfectly natural cause.\r\n\r\n"There is an element of madness in this," Julien said to himself.\r\nThis man\'s character has a striking analogy with that of the Emperor\r\nAlexander, such as the Prince Korasoff described it to me. During the\r\nfirst year of his stay in Paris poor Julien, fresh from the seminary\r\nand dazzled by the graces of all these amiable young people, whom he\r\nfound so novel, had felt bound to admire them. Their true character was\r\nonly beginning to become outlined in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I am playing an undignified r\xc3\xb4le here," he suddenly thought. The\r\nquestion was, how he could leave the little straw chair without undue\r\nawkwardness. He wanted to invent something, and tried to extract some\r\nnovel excuse from an imagination which was otherwise engrossed. He was\r\ncompelled to fall back on his memory, which was, it must be owned,\r\nsomewhat poor in resources of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe poor boy was still very much out of his element, and could not have\r\nexhibited a more complete and noticeable awkwardness when he got up to\r\nleave the salon. His misery was only too palpable in his whole manner.\r\nHe had been playing, for the last three quarters of an hour, the r\xc3\xb4le\r\nof an officious inferior from whom one does not take the trouble to\r\nhide what one really thinks.\r\n\r\nThe critical observations he had just made on his rivals prevented\r\nhim, however, from taking his own unhappiness too tragically. His pride\r\ncould take support in what had taken place the previous day. "Whatever\r\nmay be their advantages over me," he thought, as he went into the\r\ngarden alone, "Mathilde has never been to a single one of them what,\r\ntwice in my life, she has deigned to be to me!" His penetration did not\r\ngo further. He absolutely failed to appreciate the character of the\r\nextraordinary person whom chance had just made the supreme mistress of\r\nall his happiness.\r\n\r\nHe tried, on the following day, to make himself and his horse dead\r\ntired with fatigue. He made no attempt in the evening to go near the\r\nblue sofa to which Mathilde remained constant. He noticed that comte\r\nNorbert did not even deign to look at him when he met him about the\r\nhouse. "He must be doing something very much against the grain," he\r\nthought; "he is naturally so polite."\r\n\r\nSleep would have been a happiness to Julien. In spite of his physical\r\nfatigue, memories which were only too seductive commenced to invade his\r\nimagination. He had not the genius to see that, inasmuch as his long\r\nrides on horseback over forests on the outskirts of Paris only affected\r\nhim, and had no affect at all on Mathilde\'s heart or mind, he was\r\nconsequently leaving his eventual destiny to the caprice of chance. He\r\nthought that one thing would give his pain an infinite relief: it would\r\nbe to speak to Mathilde. Yet what would he venture to say to her?\r\n\r\nHe was dreaming deeply about this at seven o\'clock one morning when he\r\nsuddenly saw her enter the library.\r\n\r\n"I know, monsieur, that you are anxious to speak to me."\r\n\r\n"Great heavens! who told you?"\r\n\r\n"I know, anyway; that is enough. If you are dishonourable, you can\r\nruin me, or at least try to. But this danger, which I do not believe\r\nto be real, will certainly not prevent me from being sincere. I do\r\nnot love you any more, monsieur, I have been led astray by my foolish\r\nimagination."\r\n\r\nDistracted by love and unhappiness, as a result of this terrible blow,\r\nJulien tried to justify himself. Nothing could have been more absurd.\r\nDoes one make any excuses for failure to please? But reason had no\r\nlonger any control over his actions. A blind instinct urged him to get\r\nthe determination of his fate postponed. He thought that, so long as\r\nhe kept on speaking, all could not be over. Mathilde had not listened\r\nto his words; their sound irritated her. She could not conceive how he\r\ncould have the audacity to interrupt her.\r\n\r\nShe was rendered equally unhappy this morning by remorseful virtue and\r\nremorseful pride. She felt to some extent pulverised by the idea of\r\nhaving given a little abb\xc3\xa9, who was the son of a peasant, rights over\r\nher. "It is almost," she said to herself, in those moments when she\r\nexaggerated her own misfortune, "as though I had a weakness for one of\r\nmy footmen to reproach myself with." In bold, proud natures there is\r\nonly one step from anger against themselves to wrath against others. In\r\nthese cases the very transports of fury constitute a vivid pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn a single minute mademoiselle de la Mole reached the point of loading\r\nJulien with the signs of the most extreme contempt. She had infinite\r\nwit, and this wit was always triumphant in the art of torturing vanity\r\nand wounding it cruelly.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life Julien found himself subjected to\r\nthe energy of a superior intellect, which was animated against him\r\nby the most violent hate. Far from having at present the slightest\r\nthought of defending himself, he came to despise himself. Hearing\r\nhimself overwhelmed with such marks of contempt which were so cleverly\r\ncalculated to destroy any good opinion that he might have of himself,\r\nhe thought that Mathilde was right, and that she did not say enough.\r\n\r\nAs for her, she found it deliciously gratifying to her pride to punish\r\nin this way both herself and him for the adoration that she had felt\r\nsome days previously.\r\n\r\nShe did not have to invent and improvise the cruel remarks which she\r\naddressed to him with so much gusto.\r\n\r\nAll she had to do was to repeat what the advocate of the other side had\r\nbeen saying against her love in her own heart for the last eight days.\r\n\r\nEach word intensified a hundredfold Julien\'s awful unhappiness. He\r\nwanted to run away, but mademoiselle de la Mole took hold of his arm\r\nauthoritatively.\r\n\r\n"Be good enough to remark," he said to her, "that you are talking very\r\nloud. You will be heard in the next room."\r\n\r\n"What does it matter?" mademoiselle de la Mole answered haughtily. "Who\r\nwill dare to say they have heard me? I want to cure your miserable\r\nvanity once and for all of any ideas you may have indulged in on my\r\naccount."\r\n\r\nWhen Julien was allowed to leave the library he was so astonished\r\nthat he was less sensitive to his unhappiness. "She does not love me\r\nany more," he repeated to himself, speaking aloud as though to teach\r\nhimself how he stood. "It seems that she has loved me eight or ten\r\ndays, but I shall love her all my life."\r\n\r\n"Is it really possible she was nothing to me, nothing to my heart so\r\nfew days back?"\r\n\r\nMathilde\'s heart was inundated by the joy of satisfied pride. So she\r\nhad been able to break with him for ever! So complete a triumph over so\r\nstrong an inclination rendered her completely happy. "So this little\r\ngentleman will understand, once and for all, that he has not, and will\r\nnever have, any dominion over me." She was so happy that in reality she\r\nceased to love at this particular moment.\r\n\r\nIn a less passionate being than Julien love would have become\r\nimpossible after a scene of such awful humiliation. Without deviating\r\nfor a single minute from the requirements of her own self-respect,\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole had addressed to him some of those unpleasant\r\nremarks which are so well thought out that they may seem true, even\r\nwhen remembered in cold blood.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which Julien drew in the first moment of so surprising a\r\nscene, was that Mathilde was infinitely proud. He firmly believed that\r\nall was over between them for ever, and none the less, he was awkward\r\nand nervous towards her at breakfast on the following day. This was a\r\nfault from which up to now he had been exempt.\r\n\r\nBoth in small things as in big it was his habit to know what he ought\r\nand wanted to do, and he used to act accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe same day after breakfast madame de la Mole asked him for a fairly\r\nrare, seditious pamphlet which her cur\xc3\xa9 had surreptitiously brought her\r\nin the morning, and Julien, as he took it from a bracket, knocked over\r\na blue porcelain vase which was as ugly as it could possibly be.\r\n\r\nMadame de la Mole got up, uttering a cry of distress, and proceeded to\r\ncontemplate at close quarters the ruins of her beloved vase. "It was\r\nold Japanese," she said. "It came to me from my great aunt, the abbess\r\nof Chelles. It was a present from the Dutch to the Regent, the Duke of\r\nOrleans, who had given it to his daughter...."\r\n\r\nMathilde had followed her mother\'s movements, and felt delighted at\r\nseeing that the blue vase, that she had thought horribly ugly, was\r\nbroken. Julien was taciturn, and not unduly upset. He saw mademoiselle\r\nde la Mole quite near him.\r\n\r\n"This vase," he said to her, "has been destroyed for ever. The same is\r\nthe case with the sentiment which was once master of my heart. I would\r\nask you to accept my apologies for all the pieces of madness which it\r\nhas made me commit." And he went out.\r\n\r\n"One would really say," said madame de la Mole, as he went out of the\r\nroom, "that this M. Sorel is quite proud of what he has just done."\r\n\r\nThese words went right home to Mathilde\'s heart. "It is true," she\r\nsaid to herself; "my mother has guessed right. That is the sentiment\r\nwhich animates him." It was only then that she ceased rejoicing over\r\nyesterday\'s scene. "Well, it is all over," she said to herself, with\r\nan apparent calm. "It is a great lesson, anyway. It is an awful and\r\nhumiliating mistake! It is enough to make me prudent all the rest of my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t I speak the truth?" thought Julien. "Why am I still\r\ntortured by the love which I once had for that mad woman?"\r\n\r\nFar, however, from being extinguished as he had hoped it would be, his\r\nlove grew more and more rapidly. "She is mad, it is true," he said\r\nto himself. "Is she any the less adorable for that? Is it possible\r\nfor anyone to be prettier? Is not mademoiselle de la Mole the ideal\r\nquintessence of all the most vivid pleasures of the most elegant\r\ncivilisation?" These memories of a bygone happiness seized hold of\r\nJulien\'s mind, and quickly proceeded to destroy all the work of his\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain that reason wrestles with memories of this character. Its\r\nstern struggles only increase the fascination.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours after the breaking of the Japanese vase, Julien was\r\nunquestionably one of the most unhappy men in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n        I have seen everything I relate, and if I may have made\r\n        a mistake when I saw it, I am certainly not deceiving\r\n        you in telling you of it.\r\n                                      _Letter to the author_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marquis summoned him; M. de la Mole looked rejuvenated, his eye was\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n"Let us discuss your memory a little," he said to Julien, "it is said\r\nto be prodigious. Could you learn four pages by heart and go and say\r\nthem at London, but without altering a single word?"\r\n\r\nThe marquis was irritably fingering, the day\'s _Quotidienne_, and was\r\ntrying in vain to hide an extreme seriousness which Julien had never\r\nnoticed in him before, even when discussing the Frilair lawsuit.\r\n\r\nJulien had already learned sufficient manners to appreciate that he\r\nought to appear completely taken in by the lightness of tone which was\r\nbeing manifested.\r\n\r\n"This number of the _Quotidienne_ is not very amusing possibly, but if\r\nM. the marquis will allow me, I shall do myself the honour to-morrow\r\nmorning of reciting it to him from beginning to end."\r\n\r\n"What, even the advertisements?"\r\n\r\n"Quite accurately and without leaving out a word."\r\n\r\n"You give me your word?" replied the marquis with sudden gravity.\r\n\r\n"Yes, monsieur; the only thing which could upset my memory is the fear\r\nof breaking my promise."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, I forgot to put this question to you yesterday: I am\r\nnot going to ask for your oath never to repeat what you are going to\r\nhear. I know you too well to insult you like that. I have answered for\r\nyou. I am going to take you into a salon where a dozen persons will he\r\nassembled. You will make a note of what each one says.\r\n\r\n"Do not be uneasy. It will not be a confused conversation by any means.\r\nEach one will speak in his turn, though not necessarily in an orderly\r\nmanner," added the marquis falling back into that light, subtle manner\r\nwhich was so natural to him. "While we are talking, you will write out\r\ntwenty pages and will come back here with me, and we will get those\r\ntwenty pages down to four, and those are the four pages you will recite\r\nto me to-morrow morning instead of the four pages of the _Quotidienne_.\r\nYou will leave immediately afterwards. You must post about like a\r\nyoung man travelling on pleasure. Your aim will be to avoid attracting\r\nattention. You will arrive at the house of a great personage. You will\r\nthere need more skill. Your business will then be to take in all his\r\nentourage, for among his secretaries and his servants are some people\r\nwho have sold themselves to our enemies, and who spy on our travelling\r\nagents in order to intercept them.\r\n\r\n"You will have an insignificant letter of introduction. At the moment\r\nhis Excellency looks at you, you will take out this watch of mine,\r\nwhich I will lend you for the journey. Wear it now, it will be so much\r\ndone; at any rate give me yours.\r\n\r\n"The duke himself will be good enough to write at your dictation the\r\nfour pages you have learnt by heart.\r\n\r\n"Having done this, but not earlier, mind you, you can, if his\r\nExcellency questions you, tell him about the meeting at which you are\r\nnow going to be present.\r\n\r\n"You will be prevented from boring yourself on the journey between\r\nParis and the minister\'s residence by the thought that there are people\r\nwho would like nothing better than to fire a shot at M. the abb\xc3\xa9 Sorel.\r\nIn that case that gentleman\'s mission will be finished, and I see a\r\ngreat delay, for how are we to know of your death, my dear friend? Even\r\nyour zeal cannot go to the length of informing us of it.\r\n\r\n"Run straight away and buy a complete suit," went on the marquis\r\nseriously. "Dress in the fashion of two years ago. To-night you must\r\nlook somewhat badly groomed. When you travel, on the other hand, you\r\nwill be as usual. Does this surprise you? Does your suspiciousness\r\nguess the secret? Yes, my friend, one of the venerable personages you\r\nare going to hear deliver his opinion, is perfectly capable of giving\r\ninformation as the result of which you stand a very good chance of\r\nbeing given at least opium some fine evening in some good inn where you\r\nwill have asked for supper."\r\n\r\n"It is better," said Julien, "to do an extra thirty leagues and not\r\ntake the direct road. It is a case of Rome, I suppose...." The marquis\r\nassumed an expression of extreme haughtiness and dissatisfaction which\r\nJulien had never seen him wear since Bray-le-Haut.\r\n\r\n"That is what you will know, monsieur, when I think it proper to tell\r\nyou. I do not like questions."\r\n\r\n"That was not one," answered Julien eagerly. "I swear, monsieur, I was\r\nthinking quite aloud. My mind was trying to find out the safest route."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it seems your mind was a very long way off. Remember that an\r\nemissary, and particularly one of your age should not appear to be a\r\nman who forces confidences."\r\n\r\nJulien was very mortified; he was in the wrong. His vanity tried to\r\nfind an excuse and did not find one.\r\n\r\n"You understand," added monsieur de la Mole, "that one always falls\r\nback on one\'s heart when one has committed some mistake."\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards Julien was in the marquis\'s ante-chamber. He looked\r\nquite like a servant with his old clothes, a tie of a dubious white,\r\nand a certain touch of the usher in his whole appearance. The marquis\r\nburst out laughing as he saw him, and it was only then that Julien\'s\r\njustification was complete.\r\n\r\n"If this young man betrays me," said M. de la Mole to himself, "whom is\r\none to trust? And yet, when one acts, one must trust someone. My son\r\nand his brilliant friends of the same calibre have as much courage and\r\nloyalty as a hundred thousand men. If it were necessary to fight, they\r\nwould die on the steps of the throne. They know everything--except\r\nwhat one needs in emergency. Devil take me if I can find a single one\r\namong them who can learn four pages by heart and do a hundred leagues\r\nwithout being tracked down. Norbert would know how to sell his life as\r\ndearly as his grandfathers did. But any conscript could do as much."\r\n\r\nThe marquis fell into a profound reverie. "As for selling one\'s life\r\ntoo," he said with a sigh, "perhaps this Sorel would manage it quite as\r\nwell as he could.\r\n\r\n"Let us get into the carriage," said the marquis as though to chase\r\naway an unwanted idea.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said Julien, "while they were getting this suit ready for\r\nme, I learnt the first page of to-days _Quotidienne_ by heart."\r\n\r\nThe marquis took the paper. Julien recited it without making a single\r\nmistake. "Good," said the marquis, who this night felt very diplomatic.\r\n"During the time he takes over this our young man will not notice the\r\nstreets through which we are passing."\r\n\r\nThey arrived in a big salon that looked melancholy enough and was\r\npartly upholstered in green velvet. In the middle of the room\r\na scowling lackey had just placed a big dining-table which he\r\nsubsequently changed into a writing-table by means of an immense green\r\ninkstained tablecloth which had been plundered from some minister.\r\n\r\nThe master of the house was an enormous man whose name was not\r\npronounced. Julien thought he had the appearance and eloquence of a\r\nman who ruminated. At a sign from the marquis, Julien had remained at\r\nthe lower end of the table. In order to keep himself in countenance,\r\nhe began to cut quills. He counted out of the corner of his eye seven\r\nvisitors, but Julien could only see their backs. Two seemed to him\r\nto be speaking to M. de la Mole on a footing of equality, the others\r\nseemed more or less respectful.\r\n\r\nA new person entered without being announced. "This is strange,"\r\nthought Julien. "People are not announced in this salon. Is this\r\nprecaution taken in my honour?" Everybody got up to welcome the new\r\narrival. He wore the same extremely distinguished decoration as three\r\nof the other persons who were in the salon. They talked fairly low. In\r\nendeavouring to form an opinion of the new comer, Julien was reduced to\r\nseeing what he could learn from his features and his appearance. He was\r\nshort and thick-set. He had a high colour and a brilliant eye and an\r\nexpression that looked like a malignant boar, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s attention was partly distracted by the almost immediate\r\narrival of a very different kind of person. It was a tall very thin\r\nman who wore three or four waistcoats. His eye was caressing, his\r\ndemeanour polite.\r\n\r\n"He looks exactly like the old bishop of Besan\xc3\xa7on," thought Julien.\r\nThis man evidently belonged to the church, was apparently not more than\r\nfifty to fifty-five years of age, and no one could have looked more\r\npaternal than he did.\r\n\r\nThe young bishop of Agde appeared. He looked very astonished when,\r\nin making a scrutiny of those present, his gaze fell upon Julien. He\r\nhad not spoken to him since the ceremony of Bray-le-Haut. His look of\r\nsurprise embarrassed and irritated Julien. "What!" he said to himself,\r\n"will knowing a man always turn out unfortunate for me? I don\'t feel\r\nthe least bit intimidated by all those great lords whom I have never\r\nseen, but the look of that young bishop freezes me. I must admit that I\r\nam a very strange and very unhappy person."\r\n\r\nAn extremely swarthy little man entered noisily soon afterwards and\r\nstarted talking as soon as he reached the door. He had a yellow\r\ncomplexion and looked a little mad. As soon as this ruthless talker\r\narrived, the others formed themselves into knots with the apparent\r\nobject of avoiding the bother of listening to him.\r\n\r\nAs they went away from the mantelpiece they came near the lower end\r\nof the table where Julien was placed. His countenance became more and\r\nmore embarrassed, for whatever efforts he made, he could not avoid\r\nhearing, and in spite of all his lack of experience he appreciated\r\nall the moment of the things which they were discussing with such\r\ncomplete frankness, and the importance which the high personages whom\r\nhe apparently had under his observation must attach to their being kept\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nJulien had already cut twenty quills as slowly as possible; this\r\ndistraction would shortly be no longer available. He looked in vain at\r\nM. de la Mole\'s eyes for an order; the marquis had forgotten him.\r\n\r\n"What I am doing is ridiculous," he said to himself as he cut his\r\nquills, "but persons with so mediocre an appearance and who are\r\nhandling such great interests either for themselves or for others must\r\nbe extremely liable to take offence. My unfortunate look has a certain\r\nquestioning and scarcely respectful expression, which will doubtless\r\nirritate them. But if I palpably lower my eyes I shall look as if I\r\nwere picking up every word they said."\r\n\r\nHis embarrassment was extreme, he was listening to strange things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nTHE DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n        The republic:--For one man to day who will sacrifice\r\n        everything for the public welfare, there are thousands\r\n        and millions who think of nothing except their\r\n        enjoyments and their vanity. One is requested in Paris\r\n        by reason of the qualities not of one\'s self but of\r\n        one\'s carriage.\r\n                                        --NAPOLEON, Memorial.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe footman rushed in saying "Monsieur the duke de ----"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, you are just a fool," said the duke as he entered.\r\nHe spoke these words so well, and with so much majesty, that Julien\r\ncould not help thinking this great person\'s accomplishments were\r\nlimited to the science of snubbing a lackey. Julien raised his\r\neyes and immediately lowered them. He had so fully appreciated the\r\nsignificance of the new arrival that he feared that his look might be\r\nan indiscretion.\r\n\r\nThe duke was a man of fifty dressed like a dandy and with a jerky\r\nwalk. He had a narrow head with a large nose and a face that jutted\r\nforward; it would have been difficult to have looked at the same time\r\nmore insignificant. His arrival was the signal for the opening of the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nJulien was sharply interrupted in his physiognomical observations by\r\nde la Mole\'s voice. "I present to you M. the abb\xc3\xa9 Sorel," said the\r\nMarquis. "He is gifted with an astonishing memory; it is scarcely an\r\nhour ago since I spoke to him of the mission by which he might be\r\nhonoured, and he has learned the first page of the _Quotidienne_ by\r\nheart in order to give proof of his memory."\r\n\r\n"Ah! foreign news of that poor N--" said the master of the house. He\r\ntook up the paper eagerly and looked at Julien in a manner rendered\r\nhumorous by its own self-importance. "Speak, monsieur," he said to him.\r\n\r\nThe silence was profound, all eyes were fixed on Julien. He recited\r\nso well that the duke said at the end of twenty lines, "That is\r\nenough." The little man who looked like a boar sat down. He was the\r\npresident, for he had scarcely taken his place before he showed Julien\r\na card-table and signed to him to bring it near him. Julien established\r\nhimself at it with writing materials. He counted twelve persons seated\r\nround the green table cloth.\r\n\r\n"M. Sorel," said the Duke, "retire into next room, you will be called."\r\n\r\nThe master of the house began to look very anxious. "The shutters\r\nare not shut," he said to his neighbour in a semi-whisper. "It is no\r\ngood looking out of the window," he stupidly cried to Julien--"so\r\nhere I am more or less mixed up in a conspiracy," thought the latter.\r\n"Fortunately it is not one of those which lead to the Place-de-Gr\xc3\xa8ve.\r\nEven though there were danger, I owe this and even more to the marquis,\r\nand should be glad to be given the chance of making up for all the\r\nsorrow which my madness may one day occasion him."\r\n\r\nWhile thinking of his own madness and his own unhappiness he regarded\r\nthe place where he was, in such a way as to imprint it upon his memory\r\nfor ever. He then remembered for the first time that he had never heard\r\nthe lackey tell the name of the street, and that the marquis had taken\r\na fiacre which he never did in the ordinary way. Julien was left to\r\nhis own reflections for a long time. He was in a salon upholstered in\r\nred velvet with large pieces of gold lace. A large ivory crucifix was\r\non the console-table and a gilt-edged, magnificently bound copy of M.\r\nde Maistre\'s book _The Pope_ was on the mantelpiece. Julien opened it\r\nso as not to appear to be eavesdropping. From time to time they talked\r\nloudly in the next room. At last the door was opened and he was called\r\nin.\r\n\r\n"Remember, gentlemen," the president was saying "that from this moment\r\nwe are talking in the presence of the duke of ----. This gentleman,"\r\nhe said, pointing to Julien, "is a young acolyte devoted to our sacred\r\ncause who by the aid of his marvellous memory will repeat quite easily\r\nour very slightest words."\r\n\r\n"It is your turn to speak, Monsieur," he said pointing to the paternal\r\nlooking personage who wore three or four waistcoats. Julien thought it\r\nwould have been more natural to have called him the gentleman in the\r\nwaistcoats. He took some paper and wrote a great deal.\r\n\r\n(At this juncture the author would have liked to have put a page of\r\ndots. "That," said his publisher, "would be clumsy and in the case of\r\nso light a work clumsiness is death."\r\n\r\n"Politics," replies the author, "is a stone tied round the neck of\r\nliterature which submerges it in less than six months. Politics in the\r\nmidst of imaginative matter is like a pistol shot in the middle of a\r\nconcert. The noise is racking without being energetic. It does not\r\nharmonise with the sound of any instrument. These politics will give\r\nmortal offence to one half of the readers and will bore the other half,\r\nwho will have already read the ideas in question as set out in the\r\nmorning paper in its own drastic manner."\r\n\r\n"If your characters don\'t talk politics," replied the publisher, "they\r\ncease to be Frenchmen of 1830, and your book is no longer a mirror as\r\nyou claim?")\r\n\r\nJulien\'s record ran to twenty-six pages. Here is a very diluted\r\nextract, for it has been necessary to adopt the invariable practice of\r\nsuppressing those ludicrous passages, whose violence would have seemed\r\neither offensive or intolerable (see the _Gazette des Tribunaux_).\r\n\r\nThe man with the waistcoats and the paternal expression (he was perhaps\r\na bishop) often smiled and then his eyes, which were surrounded with\r\na floating forest of eyebrows, assumed a singular brilliance and an\r\nunusually decided expression. This personage whom they made speak first\r\nbefore the duke ("but what duke is it?" thought Julien to himself) with\r\nthe apparent object of expounding various points of view and fulfilling\r\nthe functions of an advocate-general, appeared to Julien to fall into\r\nthe uncertainty and lack of definiteness with which those officials\r\nare so often taxed. During the course of the discussion the duke went\r\nso far as to reproach him on this score. After several sentences of\r\nmorality and indulgent philosophy the man in the waistcoats said,\r\n\r\n"Noble England, under the guiding hand of a great man, the immortal\r\nPitt, has spent forty milliards of francs in opposing the revolution.\r\nIf this meeting will allow me to treat so melancholy a subject with\r\nsome frankness, England fails to realise sufficiently that in dealing\r\nwith a man like Buonaparte, especially when they have nothing to\r\noppose him with, except a bundle of good intentions there is nothing\r\ndecisive except personal methods."\r\n\r\n"Ah! praising assassination again!" said the master of the house\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n"Spare us your sentimental sermons," cried the president angrily. His\r\nboarlike eye shone with a savage brilliance. "Go on," he said to the\r\nman with the waistcoats. The cheeks and the forehead of the president\r\nbecame purple.\r\n\r\n"Noble England," replied the advocate-general, "is crushed to-day:\r\nfor each Englishman before paying for his own bread is obliged to pay\r\nthe interest on forty milliards of francs which were used against the\r\nJacobins. She has no more Pitt."\r\n\r\n"She has the Duke of Wellington," said a military personage looking\r\nvery important.\r\n\r\n"Please, gentlemen, silence," exclaimed the president. "If we are still\r\ngoing to dispute, there was no point in having M. Sorel in."\r\n\r\n"We know that monsieur has many ideas," said the duke irritably,\r\nlooking at the interrupter who was an old Napoleonic general. Julien\r\nsaw that these words contained some personal and very offensive\r\nallusion. Everybody smiled, the turncoat general appeared beside\r\nhimself with rage.\r\n\r\n"There is no longer a Pitt, gentlemen," went on the speaker with all\r\nthe despondency of a man who has given up all hope of bringing his\r\nlisteners to reason. "If there were a new Pitt in England, you would\r\nnot dupe a nation twice over by the same means."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why a victorious general, a Buonaparte, will be henceforward\r\nimpossible in France," exclaimed the military interrupter.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion neither the president nor the duke ventured to get\r\nangry, though Julien thought he read in their eyes that they would\r\nvery much like to have done so. They lowered their eyes, and the duke\r\ncontented himself with sighing in quite an audible manner. But the\r\nspeaker was put upon his mettle.\r\n\r\n"My audience is eager for me to finish," he said vigorously, completely\r\ndiscarding that smiling politeness and that balanced diction that\r\nJulien thought had expressed his character so well. "It is eager for\r\nme to finish, it is not grateful to me for the efforts I am making to\r\noffend nobody\'s ears, however long they may be. Well, gentlemen, I will\r\nbe brief.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you in quite common words: England has not got a sou with\r\nwhich to help the good cause. If Pitt himself were to come back he\r\nwould never succeed with all his genius in duping the small English\r\nlandowners, for they know that the short Waterloo campaign alone cost\r\nthem a milliard of francs. As you like clear phrases," continued the\r\nspeaker, becoming more and more animated, "I will say this to you: Help\r\nyourselves, for England has not got a guinea left to help you with,\r\nand when England does not pay, Austria, Russia and Prussia--who will\r\nonly have courage but have no money--cannot launch more than one or two\r\ncampaigns against France.\r\n\r\n"One may hope that the young soldiers who will be recruited by the\r\nJacobins will be beaten in the first campaign, and possibly in the\r\nsecond; but, even though I seem a revolutionary in your prejudiced\r\neyes, in the third campaign--in the third campaign I say--you will have\r\nthe soldiers of 1794 who were no longer the soldiers enlisted in 1792."\r\n\r\nAt this point interruption broke out simultaneously from three or four\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said the president to Julien, "Go and make a pr\xc3\xa9cis in the\r\nnext room of the beginning of the report which you have written out."\r\n\r\nJulien went out to his great regret. The speaker was just dealing\r\nwith the question of probabilities which formed the usual subject\r\nfor his meditations. "They are frightened of my making fun of them,"\r\nhe thought. When he was called back, M. de la Mole was saying with a\r\nseriousness which seemed quite humorous to Julien who knew him so well,\r\n\r\n"Yes, gentlemen, one finds the phrase, \'is it god, table or tub?\'\r\nespecially applicable to this unhappy people. \'_It is god_\' exclaims\r\nthe writer of fables. It is to you, gentlemen, that this noble and\r\nprofound phrase seems to apply. Act on your own initiative, and noble\r\nFrance will appear again, almost such as our ancestors made her, and as\r\nour own eyes have seen her before the death of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\n"England execrates disgraceful Jacobinism as much as we do, or at any\r\nrate her noble lords do. Without English gold, Austria and Prussia\r\nwould only be able to give battle two or three times. Would that be\r\nsufficient to ensure a successful occupation like the one which M. de\r\nRichelieu so foolishly failed to exploit in 1817? I do not think so."\r\n\r\nAt this point there was an interruption which was stifled by the hushes\r\nof the whole room. It came again from the old Imperial general who\r\nwanted the blue ribbon and wished to figure among the authors of the\r\nsecret note.\r\n\r\n"I do not think so," replied M. de la Mole, after the uproar had\r\nsubsided. He laid stress on the "I" with an insolence which charmed\r\nJulien.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a pretty piece of acting," he said to himself, as he made his\r\npen almost keep pace with the marquis\' words.\r\n\r\nM. de la Mole annihilated the twenty campaigns of the turncoat with a\r\nwell turned phrase.\r\n\r\n"It is not only on foreign powers," continued the marquis in a more\r\neven tone, "on whom we shall be able to rely for a new military\r\noccupation. All those young men who write inflammatory articles\r\nin the _Globe_ will provide you with three or four thousand young\r\ncaptains among whom you may find men with the genius, but not the good\r\nintentions of a Kl\xc3\xa9ber, a Hoche, a Jourdan, a Pichegru."\r\n\r\n"We did not know how to glorify him," said the president. "He should\r\nhave been immortalized."\r\n\r\n"Finally, it is necessary for France to have two parties," went on M.\r\nde la Mole; "but two parties not merely in name, but with clear-cut\r\nlines of cleavage. Let us realise what has got to be crushed. On\r\nthe one hand the journalists and the electors, in a word, public\r\nopinion; youth and all that admire it. While it is stupefying itself\r\nwith the noise of its own vain words, we have certain advantages of\r\nadministrating the expenditure of the budget."\r\n\r\nAt this point there was another interruption.\r\n\r\n"As for you, monsieur," said M. de la Mole to the interrupter, with an\r\nadmirable haughtiness and ease of manner, "you do not spend, if the\r\nwords chokes you, but you devour the forty thousand francs put down to\r\nyou in the State budget, and the eighty thousand which you receive from\r\nthe civil list."\r\n\r\n"Well, monsieur, since you force me to it, I will be bold enough to\r\ntake you for an example. Like your noble ancestors, who followed Saint\r\nLouis to the crusade, you ought in return for those hundred and twenty\r\nthousand francs to show us at any rate a regiment; a company, why, what\r\nam I saying? say half a company, even if it only had fifty men, ready\r\nto fight and devoted to the good cause to the point of risking their\r\nlives in its service. You have nothing but lackeys, who in the event of\r\na rebellion would frighten you yourselves."\r\n\r\n"Throne, Church, Nobility are liable to perish to-morrow, gentlemen,\r\nso long as you refrain from creating in each department a force of\r\nfive hundred devoted men, devoted I mean, not only with all the French\r\ncourage, but with all the Spanish constancy.\r\n\r\n"Half of this force ought to be composed of our children, our nephews,\r\nof real gentlemen, in fact. Each of them will have beside him not a\r\nlittle talkative bourgeois ready to hoist the tricolor cockade, if 1815\r\nturns up again, but a good, frank and simple peasant like Cathelineau.\r\nOur gentleman will have educated him, it will be his own foster brother\r\nif it is possible. Let each of us sacrifice the fifth of his income in\r\norder to form this little devoted force of five hundred men in each\r\ndepartment. Then you will be able to reckon on a foreign occupation.\r\nThe foreign soldier will never penetrate even as far as Dijon if he\r\nis not certain of finding five hundred friendly soldiers in each\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n"The foreign kings will only listen to you when you are in a position\r\nto announce to them that you have twenty thousand gentlemen ready to\r\ntake up arms in order to open to them the gates of France. The service\r\nis troublesome, you say. Gentlemen, it is the only way of saving our\r\nlives. There is war to the death between the liberty of the press and\r\nour existence as gentlemen. Become manufacturers, become peasants, or\r\ntake up your guns. Be timid if you like, but do not be stupid. Open\r\nyour eyes.\r\n\r\n"\'_Form your battalions_,\' I would say to you in the words of the\r\nJacobin songs. Some noble Gustavus Adolphus will then be found who,\r\ntouched by the imminent peril of the monarchical principle, will make\r\na dash three hundred leagues from his own country, and will do for\r\nyou what Gustavus did for the Protestant princes. Do you want to go\r\non talking without acting? In fifty years\' time there will be only\r\npresidents or republics in Europe and not one king, and with those\r\nthree letters R. O. I. you will see the last of the priests and the\r\ngentlemen. I can see nothing but candidates paying court to squalid\r\nmajorities.\r\n\r\n"It is no use your saying that at the present time France has not\r\na single accredited general who is universally known and loved,\r\nthat the army is only known and organised in the interests of the\r\nthrone and the church, and that it has been deprived of all its old\r\ntroopers, while each of the Prussian and Austrian regiments count fifty\r\nnon-commissioned officers who have seen fire.\r\n\r\n"Two hundred thousand young men of the middle classes are spoiling for\r\nwar--"\r\n\r\n"A truce to disagreeable truths," said a grave personage in a pompous\r\ntone. He was apparently a very high ecclesiastical dignitary, for M.\r\nde la Mole smiled pleasantly, instead of getting angry, a circumstance\r\nwhich greatly impressed Julien.\r\n\r\n"A truce to unpleasant truths, let us resume, gentlemen. The man who\r\nneeds to have a gangrened leg cut off would be ill advised to say to\r\nhis surgeon, \'this disease is very healthy.\' If I may use the metaphor,\r\ngentlemen, the noble duke of ---- is our surgeon."\r\n\r\n"So the great words have at last been uttered," thought Julien. "It is\r\ntowards the ---- that I shall gallop to-night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\nTHE CLERGY, THE FORESTS, LIBERTY\r\n\r\n\r\n        The first law of every being, is to preserve itself and\r\n        live. You sow hemlock, and expect to see ears of corn\r\n        ripen.--_Machiavelli_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great personage continued. One could see that he knew his subject.\r\nHe proceeded to expound the following great truths with a soft and\r\ntempered eloquence with which Julien was inordinately delighted:--\r\n\r\n"1. England has not a guinea to help us with; economy and Hume are\r\nthe fashion there. Even the saints will not give us any money, and M.\r\nBrougham will make fun of us.\r\n\r\n"2. The impossibility of getting the kings of Europe to embark on more\r\nthan two campaigns without English gold; two campaigns will not be\r\nenough to dispose of the middle classes.\r\n\r\n"3. The necessity of forming an armed party in France. Without this,\r\nthe monarchical principle in Europe will not risk even two campaigns.\r\n\r\n"The fourth point which I venture to suggest to you, as self-evident,\r\nis this:\r\n\r\n"The impossibility of forming an armed party in France without the\r\nclergy. I am bold enough to tell you this because I will prove it to\r\nyou, gentlemen. You must make every sacrifice for the clergy.\r\n\r\n"Firstly, because as it is occupied with its mission by day and by\r\nnight, and guided by highly capable men established far from these\r\nstorms at three hundred leagues from your frontiers----"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Rome, Rome!" exclaimed the master of the house.\r\n\r\n"Yes, monsieur, Rome," replied the Cardinal haughtily. "Whatever more\r\nor less ingenious jokes may have been the fashion when you were young,\r\nI have no hesitation in saying that in 1830 it is only the clergy,\r\nunder the guidance of Rome, who has the ear of the lower classes.\r\n\r\n"Fifty thousand priests repeat the same words on the day appointed by\r\ntheir chiefs, and the people--who after all provide soldiers--will be\r\nmore touched by the voices of its priests than by all the versifying in\r\nthe whole world." (This personality provoked some murmurs.)\r\n\r\n"The clergy has a genius superior to yours," went on the cardinal\r\nraising his voice. "All the progress that has been made towards this\r\nessential point of having an armed party in France has been made by\r\nus." At this juncture facts were introduced. "Who used eighty thousand\r\nrifles in Vend\xc3\xa9e?" etc., etc.\r\n\r\n"So long as the clergy is without its forests it is helpless. At\r\nthe first war the minister of finance will write to his agents that\r\nthere is no money to be had except for the cur\xc3\xa9. At bottom France\r\ndoes not believe, and she loves war. Whoever gives her war will be\r\ndoubly popular, for making war is, to use a vulgar phrase, the same as\r\nstarving the Jesuits; making war means delivering those monsters of\r\npride--the men of France--from the menace of foreign intervention."\r\n\r\nThe cardinal had a favourable hearing. "M. de Nerval," he said, "will\r\nhave to leave the ministry, his name irritates and to no purpose."\r\n\r\nAt these words everybody got up and talked at the same time. "I will be\r\nsent away again," thought Julien, but the sapient president himself had\r\nforgotten both the presence and existence of Julien.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned upon a man whom Julien recognised. It was M. de\r\nNerval, the prime minister, whom he had seen at M. the duc de Retz\'s\r\nball.\r\n\r\nThe disorder was at its height, as the papers say when they talk of the\r\nChamber. At the end of a long quarter of an hour a little quiet was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThen M. de Nerval got up and said in an apostolic tone and a singular\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"I will not go so far as to say that I do not set great store on being\r\na minister.\r\n\r\n"It has been demonstrated to me, gentlemen, that my name will double\r\nthe forces of the Jacobins by making many moderates divide against\r\nus. I should therefore be willing to retire; but the ways of the Lord\r\nare only visible to a small number; but," he added, looking fixedly\r\nat the cardinal, "I have a mission. Heaven has said: \'You will either\r\nloose your head on the scaffold or you will re-establish the monarchy\r\nof France and reduce the Chambers to the condition of the parliament of\r\nLouis XV.,\' and that, gentlemen, I shall do."\r\n\r\nHe finished his speech, sat down, and there was a long silence.\r\n\r\n"What a good actor," thought Julien. He made his usual mistake of\r\nascribing too much intelligence to the people. Excited by the debates\r\nof so lively an evening, and above all by the sincerity of the\r\ndiscussion, M. de Nerval did at this moment believe in his mission.\r\nThis man had great courage, but at the same time no sense.\r\n\r\nDuring the silence that followed the impressive words, "I shall do it,"\r\nmidnight struck. Julien thought that the striking of the clock had in\r\nit a certain element of funereal majesty. He felt moved.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was soon resumed with increasing energy, and above all\r\nwith an incredible naivety. "These people will have me poisoned,"\r\nthought Julien at times. "How can they say such things before a\r\nplebian."\r\n\r\nThey were still talking when two o\'clock struck. The master of the\r\nhouse had been sleeping for some time. M. de la Mole was obliged to\r\nring for new candles. M. de Nerval, the minister, had left at the\r\nquarter to two, but not without having repeatedly studied Julien\'s face\r\nin a mirror which was at the minister\'s side. His departure had seemed\r\nto put everybody at their ease.\r\n\r\nWhile they were bringing new candles, the man in the waistcoats,\r\nwhispered to his neighbour: "God knows what that man will say to the\r\nking. He may throw ridicule upon us and spoil our future."\r\n\r\n"One must own that he must possess an unusual self-assurance, not to\r\nsay impudence, to put in an appearance here There were signs of it\r\nbefore he became a minister; but a portfolio changes everything and\r\nswamps all a man\'s interests; he must have felt its effect."\r\n\r\nThe minister had scarcely left before the general of Buonaparte closed\r\nhis eyes. He now talked of his health and his wounds, consulted his\r\nwatch, and went away.\r\n\r\n"I will wager," said the man in the waistcoats, "that the general is\r\nrunning after the minister; he will apologise for having been here and\r\npretend that he is our leader."\r\n\r\n"Let us now deliberate, gentlemen," said the president, after the\r\nsleepy servants had finished bringing and lighting new candles. "Let us\r\nleave off trying to persuade each other. Let us think of the contents\r\nof the note which will be read by our friends outside in forty-eight\r\nhours from now. We have heard ministers spoken of. Now that M. de\r\nNerval has left us, we are at liberty to say \'what we do care for\r\nministers.\'"\r\n\r\nThe cardinal gave a subtle smile of approval.\r\n\r\n"Nothing is easier it seems to me than summing up our position," said\r\nthe young bishop of Agde, with the restrained concentrated fire of the\r\nmost exalted fanaticism. He had kept silent up to this time; his eye,\r\nwhich Julien had noticed as being soft and calm at the beginning, had\r\nbecome fiery during the first hour of the discussion. His soul was now\r\nbubbling over like lava from Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n"England only made one mistake from 1806 to 1814," he said, "and that\r\nwas in not taking direct and personal measures against Napoleon. As\r\nsoon as that man had made dukes and chamberlains, as soon as he had\r\nre-established the throne, the mission that God had entrusted to him\r\nwas finished. The only thing to do with him was to sacrifice him.\r\nThe scriptures teach us in more than one place how to make an end of\r\ntyrants" (at this point there were several Latin quotations).\r\n\r\n"To-day, gentlemen, it is not a man who has to be sacrificed, it\r\nis Paris. What is the use of arming your five hundred men in each\r\ndepartment, a hazardous and interminable enterprise? What is the good\r\nof involving France in a matter which is personal to Paris? Paris alone\r\nhas done the evil, with its journals and it salons. Let the new Babylon\r\nperish.\r\n\r\n"We must bring to an end the conflict between the church and Paris.\r\nSuch a catastrophe would even be in the worldly interests of the\r\nthrone. Why did not Paris dare to whisper a word under Buonaparte? Ask\r\nthe cannon of Saint-Roch?"\r\n\r\nJulien did not leave with M. de la Mole before three o\'clock in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe marquis seemed tired and ashamed. For the first time in his life\r\nin conversation with Julien, his tone was plaintive. He asked him for\r\nhis word never to reveal the excesses of zeal, that was his expression,\r\nof which chance had just made him a witness. "Only mention it to our\r\nforeign friend, if he seriously insists on knowing what our young\r\nmadmen are like. What does it matter to them if a state is overthrown,\r\nthey will become cardinals and will take refuge in Rome. As for us, we\r\nshall be massacred by the peasants in our ch\xc3\xa2teaus."\r\n\r\nThe secret note into which the marquis condensed Julien\'s full report\r\nof twenty-six pages was not ready before a quarter to five.\r\n\r\n"I am dead tired," said the marquis, "as is quite obvious from the lack\r\nof clearness at the end of this note; I am more dissatisfied with it\r\nthan with anything I ever did in my whole life. Look here, my friend,"\r\nhe added, "go and rest for some hours, and as I am frightened you might\r\nbe kidnapped, I shall lock you up in your room."\r\n\r\nThe marquis took Julien on the following day to a lonely ch\xc3\xa2teau at a\r\ngood distance from Paris. There were strange guests there whom Julien\r\nthought were priests. He was given a passport which was made out in a\r\nfictitious name, but indicated the real destination of his journey,\r\nwhich he had always pretended not to know. He got into a carriage alone.\r\n\r\nThe marquis had no anxiety on the score of his memory. Julien\r\nhad recited the secret note to him several times but he was very\r\napprehensive of his being intercepted.\r\n\r\n"Above all, mind you look like a coxcomb who is simply travelling to\r\nkill time," he said affectionately to him when he was leaving the\r\nsalon. "Perhaps there was more than one treacherous brother in this\r\nevening\'s meeting."\r\n\r\nThe journey was quick and very melancholy. Julien had scarcely got\r\nout of the marquis\'s sight before he forgot his secret note and his\r\nmission, and only thought about Mathilde\'s disdain.\r\n\r\nAt a village some leagues beyond Metz, the postmaster came and told him\r\nthat there were no horses. It was ten o\'clock in the evening. Julien\r\nwas very annoyed and asked for supper. He walked in front of the door\r\nand gradually without being noticed passed into the stable-yard. He did\r\nnot see any horses there.\r\n\r\n"That man looked strange though," thought Julien to himself. "He was\r\nscrutinizing me with his brutal eyes."\r\n\r\nAs one sees he was beginning to be slightly sceptical of all he heard.\r\nHe thought of escaping after supper, and in order to learn at any rate\r\nsomething about the surrounding country, he left his room to go and\r\nwarm himself at the kitchen fire. He was overjoyed to find there the\r\ncelebrated singer, signor Geronimo.\r\n\r\nThe Neopolitan was ensconced in an armchair which he had had brought\r\nnear the fire. He was groaning aloud, and was speaking more to himself\r\nthan to the twenty dumbfounded German peasants who surrounded him.\r\n\r\n"Those people will be my ruin," he cried to Julien, "I have promised to\r\nsing to-morrow at Mayence. Seven sovereign princes have gone there to\r\nhear me. Let us go and take the air," he added, meaningly.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone a hundred yards down the road, and it was impossible\r\nto be overheard, he said to Julien:\r\n\r\n"Do you know the real truth, the postmaster is a scoundrel. When I went\r\nout for a walk I gave twenty sous to a little ragamuffin who told me\r\neverything. There are twelve horses in the stable at the other end of\r\nthe village. They want to stop some courier."\r\n\r\n"Really," said Julien innocently.\r\n\r\nDiscovering the fraud was not enough; the thing was to get away, but\r\nGeronimo and his friends could not succeed in doing this.\r\n\r\n"Let us wait for daybreak," said the singer at last, "they are\r\nmistrustful of us. It is perhaps you or me whom they suspect. We will\r\norder a good breakfast to-morrow morning, we will go for a walk while\r\nthey are getting it ready, we will then escape, we will hire horses,\r\nand gain the next station."\r\n\r\n"And how about your luggage?" said Julien, who thought perhaps Geronimo\r\nhimself might have been sent to intercept him. They had to have supper\r\nand go to bed. Julien was still in his first sleep when he was woken\r\nup with a start by the voices of two persons who were speaking in his\r\nroom with utmost freedom.\r\n\r\nHe recognised the postmaster armed with a dark lantern. The light was\r\nturned on the carriage-seat which Julien had had taken up into his\r\nroom. Beside the postmaster was a man who was calmly searching the open\r\nseat. Julien could see nothing except the sleeves of his coat which\r\nwere black and very tight.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a cassock," he said to himself and he softly seized the little\r\npistol which he had placed under his pillow.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be frightened of his waking up, cur\xc3\xa9," said the postmaster, "the\r\nwine that has been served him was the stuff prepared by yourself."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t find any trace of papers," answered the cur\xc3\xa9. "A lot of linen\r\nand essences, pommades, and vanities. It\'s a young man of the world\r\non pleasure bent. The other one who effects an Italian accent is more\r\nlikely to be the emissary."\r\n\r\nThe men approached Julien to search the pockets of his travelling coat.\r\nHe felt very tempted to kill them for thieves. Nothing could be safer\r\nin its consequences. He was very desirous of doing so.... "I should\r\nonly be a fool," he said to himself, "I should compromise my mission."\r\n"He is not a diplomatist," said the priest after searching his coat. He\r\nwent away and did well to do so.\r\n\r\n"It will be a bad business for him," Julien was saying to himself, "if\r\nhe touches me in my bed. He may have quite well come to stab me, and I\r\nwon\'t put up with that."\r\n\r\nThe cur\xc3\xa9 turned his head, Julien half opened his eyes. He was\r\ninordinately astonished, he was the abb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de. As a matter of\r\nfact, although these two persons had made a point of talking in a\r\nfairly low voice, he had thought from the first that he recognised one\r\nof the voices. Julien was seized with an inordinate desire to purge the\r\nearth of one of its most cowardly villains; "But my mission," he said\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nThe cur\xc3\xa9 and his acolyte went out. A quarter of an hour afterwards\r\nJulien pretended to have just woken up. He called out and woke up the\r\nwhole house.\r\n\r\n"I am poisoned," he exclaimed, "I am suffering horribly!" He wanted an\r\nexcuse to go to Geronimo\'s help. He found him half suffocated by the\r\nlaudanum that had been contained in the wine.\r\n\r\nJulien had been apprehensive of some trick of this character and had\r\nsupped on some chocolate which he had brought from Paris. He could not\r\nwake Geronimo up sufficiently to induce him to leave.\r\n\r\n"If they were to give me the whole kingdom of Naples," said the singer,\r\n"I would not now give up the pleasure of sleeping."\r\n\r\n"But the seven sovereign princes?"\r\n\r\n"Let them wait."\r\n\r\nJulien left alone, and arrived at the house of the great personage\r\nwithout other incident. He wasted a whole morning in vainly soliciting\r\nan audience. Fortunately about four o\'clock the duke wanted to take\r\nthe air. Julien saw him go out on foot and he did not hesitate\r\nto ask him for alms. When at two yards\' distance from the great\r\npersonage he pulled out the Marquis de la Mole\'s watch and exhibited\r\nit ostentatiously. "_Follow me at a distance_," said the man without\r\nlooking at him.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter of a league\'s distance the duke suddenly entered a little\r\n_coffee-house_. It was in a room of this low class inn that Julien had\r\nthe honour of reciting his four pages to the duke. When he had finished\r\nhe was told to "_start again and go more slowly_."\r\n\r\nThe prince took notes. "Reach the next posting station on foot. Leave\r\nyour luggage and your carriage here. Get to Strasbourg as best you can\r\nand at half-past twelve on the twenty-second of the month (it was at\r\npresent the tenth) come to this same coffee-house. Do not leave for\r\nhalf-an-hour. Silence!"\r\n\r\nThese were the only words which Julien heard. They sufficed to inspire\r\nhim with the highest admiration. "That is the way," he thought, "that\r\nreal business is done; what would this great statesman say if he were\r\nto listen to the impassioned ranters heard three days ago?"\r\n\r\nJulien took two days to reach Strasbourg. He thought he would have\r\nnothing to do there. He made a great detour. "If that devil of an abb\xc3\xa9\r\nCastan\xc3\xa8de has recognised me he is not the kind of man to loose track\r\nof me easily.... And how he would revel in making a fool of me, and\r\ncausing my mission to fail."\r\n\r\nFortunately the abb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de, who was chief of the congregational\r\npolice on all the northern frontier had not recognised him. And the\r\nStrasbourg Jesuits, although very zealous, never gave a thought to\r\nobserving Julien, who with his cross and his blue tail-coat looked\r\nlike a young military man, very much engrossed in his own personal\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n\r\n        Fascination! Love gives thee all his love, energy and\r\n        all his power of suffering unhappiness. It is only\r\n        his enchanting pleasures, his sweet delights, which\r\n        are outside thy sphere. When I saw her sleep I was\r\n        made to say "With all her angelic beauty and her sweet\r\n        weaknesses she is absolutely mine! There she is, quite\r\n        in my power, such as Heaven made her in its pity in\r\n        order to ravish a man\'s heart."--_Ode of Schiller_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien was compelled to spend eight days in Strasbourg and tried to\r\ndistract himself by thoughts of military glory and patriotic devotion.\r\nWas he in love then? he could not tell, he only felt in his tortured\r\nsoul that Mathilde was the absolute mistress both of his happiness\r\nand of his imagination. He needed all the energy of his character\r\nto keep himself from sinking into despair. It was out of his power\r\nto think of anything unconnected with mademoiselle de la Mole. His\r\nambition and his simple personal successes had formerly distracted him\r\nfrom the sentiments which madame de R\xc3\xaanal had inspired. Mathilde was\r\nall-absorbing; she loomed large over his whole future.\r\n\r\nJulien saw failure in every phase of that future. This same individual\r\nwhom we remember to have been so presumptuous and haughty at Verri\xc3\xa8res,\r\nhad fallen into an excess of grotesque modesty.\r\n\r\nThree days ago he would only have been too pleased to have killed the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 Castan\xc3\xa8de, and now, at Strasbourg, if a child had picked a quarrel\r\nwith him he would have thought the child was in the right. In thinking\r\nagain about the adversaries and enemies whom he had met in his life he\r\nalways thought that he, Julien, had been in the wrong. The fact was\r\nthat the same powerful imagination which had formerly been continuously\r\nemployed in painting a successful future in the most brilliant colours\r\nhad now been transformed into his implacable enemy.\r\n\r\nThe absolute solicitude of a traveller\'s life increased the ascendancy\r\nof this sinister imagination. What a boon a friend would have been!\r\nBut Julien said to himself, "Is there a single heart which beats with\r\naffection for me? And even if I did have a friend, would not honour\r\nenjoin me to eternal silence?"\r\n\r\nHe was riding gloomily in the outskirts of Kehl; it is a market town\r\non the banks of the Rhine and immortalised by Desaix and Gouvion\r\nSaint-Cyr. A German peasant showed him the little brooks, roads and\r\nislands of the Rhine, which have acquired a name through the courage of\r\nthese great generals. Julien was guiding his horse with his left hand,\r\nwhile he held unfolded in his right the superb map which adorns the\r\n_Memoirs of the Marshal Saint Cyr_. A merry exclamation made him lift\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nIt was the Prince Korasoff, that London friend of his, who had\r\ninitiated him some months before into the elementary rules of high\r\nfatuity. Faithful to his great art, Korasoff, who had just arrived at\r\nStrasbourg, had been one hour in Kehl and had never read a single line\r\nin his whole life about the siege of 1796, began to explain it all to\r\nJulien. The German peasant looked at him in astonishment; for he knew\r\nenough French to appreciate the enormous blunders which the prince was\r\nmaking. Julien was a thousand leagues away from the peasant\'s thoughts.\r\nHe was looking in astonishment at the handsome young man and admiring\r\nhis grace in sitting a horse.\r\n\r\n"What a lucky temperament," he said to himself, "and how his trousers\r\nsuit him and how elegantly his hair is cut! Alas, if I had been like\r\nhim, it might have been that she would not have come to dislike me\r\nafter loving me for three days."\r\n\r\nWhen the prince had finished his siege of Kehl, he said to Julien,\r\n"You look like a Trappist, you are carrying to excess that principle\r\nof gravity which I enjoined upon you in London. A melancholy manner\r\ncannot be good form. What is wanted is an air of boredom. If you are\r\nmelancholy, it is because you lack something, because you have failed\r\nin something."\r\n\r\n"That means showing one\'s own inferiority; if, on the other hand you\r\nare bored, it is only what has made an unsuccessful attempt to please\r\nyou, which is inferior. So realise, my dear friend, the enormity of\r\nyour mistake."\r\n\r\nJulien tossed a crown to the gaping peasant who was listening to them.\r\n\r\n"Good," said the prince, "that shows grace and a noble disdain, very\r\ngood!" And he put his horse to the gallop. Full of a stupid admiration,\r\nJulien followed him.\r\n\r\n"Ah! if I have been like that, she would not have preferred Croisenois\r\nto me!" The more his reason was offended by the grotesque affectations\r\nof the prince the more he despised himself for not having them. It was\r\nimpossible for self-disgust to be carried further.\r\n\r\nThe prince still finding him distinctly melancholy, said to him as they\r\nre-entered Strasbourg, "Come, my dear fellow, have you lost all your\r\nmoney, or perhaps you are in love with some little actress.\r\n\r\n"The Russians copy French manners, but always at an interval of fifty\r\nyears. They have now reached the age of Louis XV."\r\n\r\nThese jests about love brought the tears to Julien\'s eyes. "Why should\r\nI not consult this charming man," he suddenly said to himself.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, my dear friend," he said to the prince, "you see in me a\r\nman who is very much in love and jilted into the bargain. A charming\r\nwoman who lives in a neighbouring town has left me stranded here after\r\nthree passionate days, and the change kills me."\r\n\r\nUsing fictitious names, he described to the prince Mathilde\'s conduct\r\nand character.\r\n\r\n"You need not finish," said Korasoff. "In order to give you confidence\r\nin your doctor, I will finish the story you have confided to me. This\r\nyoung woman\'s husband enjoys an enormous income, or even more probably,\r\nshe belongs herself to the high nobility of the district. She must be\r\nproud about something."\r\n\r\nJulien nodded his head, he had no longer the courage to speak. "Very\r\ngood," said the prince, "here are three fairly bitter pills that you\r\nwill take without delay.\r\n\r\n"1. See madame ----. What is her name, any way?"\r\n\r\n"Madame de Dubois."\r\n\r\n"What a name!" said the prince bursting into laughter. "But forgive me,\r\nyou find it sublime. Your tactics must be to see Madame de Dubois every\r\nday; above all do not appear to be cold and piqued. Remember the great\r\nprinciple of your century: be the opposite of what is expected. Be\r\nexactly as you were the week before you were honoured by her favours."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I was calm enough then," exclaimed Julien in despair, "I thought I\r\nwas taking pity on her...."\r\n\r\n"The moth is burning itself at the candle," continued the prince using\r\na metaphor as old as the world.\r\n\r\n"1. You will see her every day.\r\n\r\n"2. You will pay court to a woman in her own set, but without\r\nmanifesting a passion, do you understand? I do not disguise from\r\nyou that your r\xc3\xb4le is difficult; you are playing a part, and if she\r\nrealises you are playing it you are lost."\r\n\r\n"She has so much intelligence and I have so little, I shall be lost,"\r\nsaid Julien sadly.\r\n\r\n"No, you are only more in love than I thought. Madame de Dubois is\r\npreoccupied with herself as are all women who have been favoured\r\nby heaven either with too much pedigree or too much money. She\r\ncontemplates herself instead of contemplating you, consequently she\r\ndoes not know you. During the two or three fits of love into which she\r\nmanaged to work herself for your especial benefit, she saw in you the\r\nhero of her dreams, and not the man you really are.\r\n\r\n"But, deuce take it, this is elementary, my dear Sorel, are you an\r\nabsolute novice?\r\n\r\n"Oddslife! Let us go into this shop. Look at that charming black\r\ncravat, one would say it was made by John Anderson of Burlington\r\nStreet. Be kind enough to take it and throw far away that awful black\r\ncord which you are wearing round your neck."\r\n\r\n"And now," continued the prince as they came out of the shop of the\r\nfirst hosier of Strasbourg, "what is the society in which madame de\r\nDubois lives? Great God, what a name, don\'t be angry, my dear Sorel, I\r\ncan\'t help it.... Now, whom are you going to pay court to?"\r\n\r\n"To an absolute prude, the daughter of an immensely rich\r\nstocking-merchant. She has the finest eyes in the world and they please\r\nme infinitely; she doubtless holds the highest place in the society\r\nof the district, but in the midst of all her greatness she blushes\r\nand becomes positively confused if anyone starts talking about trade\r\nor shops. And, unfortunately, her father was one of the best known\r\nmerchants in Strasbourg."\r\n\r\n"So," said the prince with a laugh, "you are sure that when one talks\r\nabout trade your fair lady thinks about herself and not about you. This\r\nsilly weakness is divine and extremely useful, it will prevent you\r\nfrom yielding to a single moment\'s folly when near her sparkling eyes.\r\nSuccess is assured."\r\n\r\nJulien was thinking of madame the mar\xc3\xa9chale de Fervaques who often\r\ncame to the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole. She was a beautiful foreigner who had\r\nmarried the mar\xc3\xa9chal a year before his death. The one object of her\r\nwhole life seemed to be to make people forget that she was the daughter\r\nof a manufacturer. In order to cut some figure in Paris she had placed\r\nherself at the head of the party of piety.\r\n\r\nJulien sincerely admired the prince; what would he not have given to\r\nhave possessed his affectations! The conversation between the two\r\nfriends was interminable. Korasoff was delighted: No Frenchman had ever\r\nlistened to him for so long. "So I have succeeded at last," said the\r\nprince to himself complacently, "in getting a proper hearing and that\r\ntoo through giving lessons to my master."\r\n\r\n"So we are quite agreed," he repeated to Julien for the tenth time.\r\n"When you talk to the young beauty, I mean the daughter of the\r\nStrasbourg stocking merchant in the presence of madame de Dubois, not\r\na trace of passion. But on the other hand be ardently passionate when\r\nyou write. Reading a well-written love-letter is a prude\'s supremest\r\npleasure. It is a moment of relaxation. She leaves off posing and dares\r\nto listen to her own heart; consequently two letters a day."\r\n\r\n"Never, never," said Julien despondently, "I would rather be ground in\r\na mortar than make up three phrases. I am a corpse, my dear fellow,\r\nhope nothing from me. Let me die by the road side."\r\n\r\n"And who is talking about making up phrases? I have got six volumes\r\nof copied-out love-letters in my bag. I have letters to suit every\r\nvariation of feminine character, including the most highly virtuous.\r\nDid not Kalisky pay court at Richmond-on-the-Thames at three leagues\r\nfrom London, you know, to the prettiest Quakeress in the whole of\r\nEngland?"\r\n\r\nJulien was less unhappy when he left his friend at two o\'clock in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe prince summoned a copyist on the following day, and two days\r\nafterwards Julien was the possessor of fifty-three carefully numbered\r\nlove-letters intended for the most sublime and the most melancholy\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\n"The reason why there is not fifty-four," said the prince "is because\r\nKalisky allowed himself to be dismissed. But what does it matter to\r\nyou, if you are badly treated by the stocking-merchant\'s daughter since\r\nyou only wish to produce an impression upon madame de Dubois\' heart."\r\n\r\nThey went out riding every day, the prince was mad on Julien. Not\r\nknowing how else to manifest his sudden friendship, he finished up by\r\noffering him the hand of one of his cousins, a rich Moscow heiress;\r\n"and once married," he added, "my influence and that cross of yours\r\nwill get you made a Colonel within two years."\r\n\r\n"But that cross was not given me by Napoleon, far from it."\r\n\r\n"What does it matter?" said the prince, "didn\'t he invent it. It is\r\nstill the first in Europe by a long way."\r\n\r\nJulien was on the point of accepting; but his duty called him back to\r\nthe great personage. When he left Korasoff he promised to write. He\r\nreceived the answer to the secret note which he had brought, and posted\r\ntowards Paris; but he had scarcely been alone for two successive days\r\nbefore leaving France, and Mathilde seemed a worse punishment than\r\ndeath. "I will not marry the millions Korasoff offers me," he said to\r\nhimself, "and I will follow his advice.\r\n\r\n"After all the art of seduction is his speciality. He has thought about\r\nnothing else except that alone for more than fifteen years, for he is\r\nnow thirty.\r\n\r\n"One can\'t say that he lacks intelligence; he is subtle and cunning;\r\nenthusiasm and poetry are impossible in such a character. He is an\r\nattorney: an additional reason for his not making a mistake.\r\n\r\n"I must do it, I will pay court to madame de Fervaques.\r\n\r\n"It is very likely she will bore me a little, but I will look at her\r\nbeautiful eyes which are so like those other eyes which have loved me\r\nmore than anyone in the world.\r\n\r\n"She is a foreigner; she is a new character to observe.\r\n\r\n"I feel mad, and as though I were going to the devil. I must follow the\r\nadvice of a friend and not trust myself."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nTHE MINISTRY OF VIRTUE\r\n\r\n\r\n        But if I take this pleasure with so much prudence\r\n        and circumspection I shall no longer find it a\r\n        pleasure.--_Lope de Vega_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as our hero had returned to Paris and had come out of the\r\nstudy of the marquis de La Mole, who seemed very displeased with the\r\ndespatches that were given him, he rushed off for the comte Altamira.\r\nThis noble foreigner combined with the advantage of having once been\r\ncondemned to death a very grave demeanour together with the good\r\nfortune of a devout temperament; these two qualities, and more than\r\nanything, the comte\'s high birth, made an especial appeal to madame de\r\nFervaques who saw a lot of him.\r\n\r\nJulien solemnly confessed to him that he was very much in love with her.\r\n\r\n"Her virtue is the purest and the highest," answered Altamira, "only it\r\nis a little Jesuitical and dogmatic.\r\n\r\n"There are days when, though I understand each of the expressions which\r\nshe makes use of, I never understand the whole sentence. She often\r\nmakes me think that I do not know French as well as I am said to. But\r\nyour acquaintance with her will get you talked about; it will give you\r\nweight in the world. But let us go to Bustos," said Count Altamira\r\nwho had a methodical turn of mind; "he once paid court to madame la\r\nmar\xc3\xa9chale."\r\n\r\nDon Diego Bustos had the matter explained to him at length, while he\r\nsaid nothing, like a barrister in his chambers. He had a big monk-like\r\nface with black moustaches and an inimitable gravity; he was, however,\r\na good carbonaro.\r\n\r\n"I understand," he said to Julien at last. "Has the mar\xc3\xa9chale de\r\nFervaques had lovers, or has she not? Have you consequently any hope\r\nof success? That is the question. I don\'t mind telling you, for my own\r\npart, that I have failed. Now that I am no more piqued I reason it out\r\nto myself in this way; she is often bad tempered, and as I will tell\r\nyou in a minute, she is quite vindictive.\r\n\r\n"I fail to detect in her that bilious temperament which is the sign of\r\ngenius, and shows as it were a veneer of passion over all its actions.\r\nOn the contrary, she owes her rare beauty and her fresh complexion to\r\nthe phlegmatic, tranquil character of the Dutch."\r\n\r\nJulien began to lose patience with the phlegmatic slowness of the\r\nimperturbable Spaniard; he could not help giving vent to some\r\nmonosyllables from time to time.\r\n\r\n"Will you listen to me?" Don Diego Bustos gravely said to him.\r\n\r\n"Forgive the _furia franchese_; I am all ears," said Julien.\r\n\r\n"The mar\xc3\xa9chale de Fervaques then is a great hater; she persecutes\r\nruthlessly people she has never seen--advocates, poor devils of men of\r\nletters who have composed songs like Coll\xc3\xa9, you know?\r\n\r\n    "J\'ai la marotte\r\n     D\'aimer Marote, etc."\r\n\r\nAnd Julien had to put up with the whole quotation.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard was very pleased to get a chance of singing in French.\r\n\r\nThat divine song was never listened to more impatiently. When it was\r\nfinished Don Diego said--"The mar\xc3\xa9chale procured the dismissal of the\r\nauthor of the song:\r\n\r\n    "Un jour l\'amour au cabaret."\r\n\r\nJulien shuddered lest he should want to sing it. He contented himself\r\nwith analysing it. As a matter of fact, it was blasphemous and somewhat\r\nindecent.\r\n\r\n"When the mar\xc3\xa9chale become enraged against that song," said Don Diego,\r\n"I remarked to her that a woman of her rank ought not to read all the\r\nstupid things that are published. Whatever progress piety and gravity\r\nmay make France will always have a cabaret literature.\r\n\r\n"\'Be careful,\' I said to madame de Fervaques when she had succeeded\r\nin depriving the author, a poor devil on half-pay, of a place worth\r\neighteen hundred francs a year, \'you have attacked this rhymster with\r\nyour own arms, he may answer you with his rhymes; he will make a song\r\nabout virtue. The gilded salons will be on your side; but people who\r\nlike to laugh will repeat his epigrams.\' Do you know, monsieur, what\r\nthe mar\xc3\xa9chale answered? \'Let all Paris come and see me walking to my\r\nmartyrdom for the sake of the Lord. It will be a new spectacle for\r\nFrance. The people will learn to respect the quality. It will be the\r\nfinest day of my life.\' Her eyes never looked finer."\r\n\r\n"And she has superb ones," exclaimed Julien.\r\n\r\n"I see that you are in love. Further," went on Don Diego Bustos\r\ngravely, "she has not the bilious constitution which causes\r\nvindictiveness. If, however, she likes to do harm, it is because she is\r\nunhappy, I suspect some secret misfortune. May it not be quite well a\r\ncase of prude tired of her r\xc3\xb4le?"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard looked at him in silence for a good minute.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the whole point," he added gravely, "and that\'s what may give\r\nyou ground for some hope. I have often reflected about it during the\r\ntwo years that I was her very humble servant. All your future, my\r\namorous sir, depends on this great problem. Is she a prude tired of her\r\nr\xc3\xb4le and only malicious because she is unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"Or," said Altamira emerging at last from his deep silence, "can it be\r\nas I have said twenty times before, simply a case of French vanity; the\r\nmemory of her father, the celebrated cloth merchant, constitutes the\r\nunhappiness of this frigid melancholy nature. The only happiness she\r\ncould find would be to live in Toledo and to be tortured by a confessor\r\nwho would show her hell wide open every day."\r\n\r\n"Altamira informs me you are one of us," said Don Diego, whose\r\ndemeanour was growing graver and graver to Julien as he went out. "You\r\nwill help us one day in re-winning our liberty, so I would like to help\r\nyou in this little amusement. It is right that you should know the\r\nmar\xc3\xa9chale\'s style; here are four letters in her hand-writing."\r\n\r\n"I will copy them out," exclaimed Julien, "and bring them back to you."\r\n\r\n"And you will never let anyone know a word of what we have been\r\nsaying."\r\n\r\n"Never, on my honour," cried Julien.\r\n\r\n"Well, God help you," added the Spaniard, and he silently escorted\r\nAltamira and Julien as far as the staircase.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat amused our hero; he was on the point of smiling. "So\r\nwe have the devout Altamira," he said to himself, "aiding me in an\r\nadulterous enterprise."\r\n\r\nDuring Don Diego\'s solemn conversation Julien had been attentive to the\r\nhours struck by the clock of the H\xc3\xb4tel d\'Aligre.\r\n\r\nThe dinner hour was drawing near, he was going to see Mathilde again.\r\nHe went in and dressed with much care.\r\n\r\n"Mistake No. 1," he said to himself as he descended the staircase: "I\r\nmust follow the prince\'s instructions to the letter."\r\n\r\nHe went up to his room again and put on a travelling suit which was as\r\nsimple as it could be. "All I have to do now," he thought, "is to keep\r\ncontrol of my expression." It was only half-past five and they dined at\r\nsix. He thought of going down to the salon which he found deserted. He\r\nwas moved to the point of tears at the sight of the blue sofa. "I must\r\nmake an end of this foolish sensitiveness," he said angrily, "it will\r\nbetray me." He took up a paper in order to keep himself in countenance\r\nand passed three or four times from the salon into the garden.\r\n\r\nIt was only when he was well concealed by a large oak and was trembling\r\nall over, that he ventured to raise his eyes at mademoiselle de la\r\nMole\'s window. It was hermetically sealed; he was on the point of\r\nfainting and remained for a long time leaning against the oak; then\r\nwith a staggering step he went to have another look at the gardener\'s\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nThe chain which he had once forced asunder--in, alas, such different\r\ncircumstances--had not yet been repaired. Carried away by a moment of\r\nmadness, Julien pressed it to his lips.\r\n\r\nAfter having wandered about for a long time between the salon and the\r\ngarden, Julien felt horribly tired; he was now feeling acutely the\r\neffects of a first success. My eyes will be expressionless and will not\r\nbetray me! The guests gradually arrived in the salon; the door never\r\nopened without instilling anxiety into Julien\'s heart.\r\n\r\nThey sat down at table. Mademoiselle de la Mole, always faithful to her\r\nhabit of keeping people waiting, eventually appeared. She blushed a\r\ngreat deal on seeing Julien, she had not been told of his arrival. In\r\naccordance with Prince Korasoff\'s recommendation, Julien looked at his\r\nhands. They were trembling. Troubled though he was beyond words by this\r\ndiscovery, he was sufficiently happy to look merely tired.\r\n\r\nM. de la Mole sang his praises. The marquise spoke to him a minute\r\nafterwards and complimented him on his tired appearance. Julien said to\r\nhimself at every minute, "I ought not to look too much at mademoiselle\r\nde la Mole, I ought not to avoid looking at her too much either. I must\r\nappear as I was eight days before my unhappiness----" He had occasion\r\nto be satisfied with his success and remained in the salon. Paying\r\nattention for the first time to the mistress of the house, he made\r\nevery effort to make the visitors speak and to keep the conversation\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nHis politeness was rewarded; madame la mar\xc3\xa9chale de Fervaques was\r\nannounced about eight o\'clock. Julien retired and shortly afterwards\r\nappeared dressed with the greatest care. Madame de la Mole was\r\ninfinitely grateful to him for this mark of respect and made a point\r\nof manifesting her satisfaction by telling madame de Fervaques about\r\nhis journey. Julien established himself near the mar\xc3\xa9chale in such a\r\nposition that Mathilde could not notice his eyes. In this position he\r\nlavished in accordance with all the rules in the art of love, the most\r\nabject admiration on madame de Fervaques. The first of the 53 letters\r\nwith which Prince Korasoff had presented him commenced with a tirade on\r\nthis sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe mar\xc3\xa9chale announced that she was going to the Opera-Bouffe. Julien\r\nrushed there. He ran across the Chevalier de Beauvoisis who took him\r\ninto a box occupied by Messieurs the Gentlemen of the Chamber, just\r\nnext to madame de Fervaques\'s box. Julien constantly looked at her. "I\r\nmust keep a siege-journal," he said to himself as he went back to the\r\nh\xc3\xb4tel, "otherwise I shall forget my attacks." He wrote two or three\r\npages on this boring theme, and in this way achieved the admirable\r\nresult of scarcely thinking at all about mademoiselle de la Mole.\r\n\r\nMathilde had almost forgotten him during his journey. "He is simply\r\na commonplace person after all," she thought, "his name will always\r\nrecall to me the greatest mistake in my life. I must honestly go back\r\nto all my ideas about prudence and honour; a woman who forgets them has\r\neverything to lose." She showed herself inclined to allow the contract\r\nwith the marquis de Croisenois, which had been prepared so long ago, to\r\nbe at last concluded. He was mad with joy; he would have been very much\r\nastonished had he been told that there was an element of resignation at\r\nthe bottom of those feelings of Mathilde which made him so proud.\r\n\r\nAll mademoiselle de la Mole\'s ideas changed when she saw Julien. "As a\r\nmatter of fact he is my husband," she said to herself. "If I am sincere\r\nin my return to sensible notions, he is clearly the man I ought to\r\nmarry."\r\n\r\nShe was expecting importunities and airs of unhappiness on the part of\r\nJulien; she commenced rehearsing her answers, for he would doubtless\r\ntry to address some words to her when they left the dinner table. Far\r\nfrom that he remained stubbornly in the salon and did not even look in\r\nthe direction of the garden, though God knows what pain that caused him!\r\n\r\n"It is better to have this explanation out all at once," thought\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole; she went into the garden alone, Julien did not\r\nappear. Mathilde went and walked near the salon window. She found him\r\nvery much occupied in describing to madame de Fervaques the old ruined\r\nchateau which crown the banks along the Rhine and invest them with so\r\nmuch atmosphere. He was beginning to acquit himself with some credit\r\nin that sentimental picturesque jargon which is called wit in certain\r\nsalons. Prince Korasoff would have been very proud if he had been at\r\nParis. This evening was exactly what he had predicted.\r\n\r\nHe would have approved the line of conduct which Julien followed on the\r\nsubsequent days.\r\n\r\nAn intrigue among the members of the secret government was going to\r\nbestow a few blue ribbons; madame mar\xc3\xa9chale de Fervaques was insisting\r\non her great uncle being made a chevalier of the order. The marquis de\r\nla Mole had the same pretensions for his father-in-law; they joined\r\nforces and the mar\xc3\xa9chale came to the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole nearly every day.\r\nIt was from her that Julien learned that the marquis was going to be\r\na minister. He was offering to the _Camarilla_ a very ingenious plan\r\nfor the annihilation of the charter within three years without any\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nIf M. de la Mole became a minister, Julien could hope for a bishopric:\r\nbut all these important interests seemed to be veiled and hazy. His\r\nimagination only perceived them very vaguely, and so to speak, in\r\nthe far distance. The awful unhappiness which was making him into a\r\nmadman could find no other interest in life except the character of his\r\nrelations with mademoiselle de la Mole. He calculated that after five\r\nor six careful years he would manage to get himself loved again.\r\n\r\nThis cold brain had been reduced, as one sees, to a state of complete\r\ndisorder. Out of all the qualities which had formerly distinguished\r\nhim, all that remained was a little firmness. He was literally faithful\r\nto the line of conduct which prince Korasoff had dictated, and placed\r\nhimself every evening near madame Fervaques\' armchair, but he found it\r\nimpossible to think of a word to say to her.\r\n\r\nThe strain of making Mathilde think that he had recovered exhausted his\r\nwhole moral force, and when he was with the mar\xc3\xa9chale he seemed almost\r\nlifeless; even his eyes had lost all their fire, as in cases of extreme\r\nphysical suffering.\r\n\r\nAs madame de la Mole\'s views were invariably a counterpart of the\r\nopinions of that husband of hers who could make her into a Duchess, she\r\nhad been singing Julien\'s praises for some days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\nMORAL LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\n    There also was of course in Adeline\r\n    That calm patrician polish in the address,\r\n    Which ne\'er can pass the equinoctial line\r\n    Of anything which Nature would express;\r\n    Just as a Mandarin finds nothing fine.\r\n    At least his manner suffers not to guess\r\n    That anything he views can greatly please.\r\n                            _Don Juan, c. xiii. st._ 84.\r\n\r\n\r\n"There is an element of madness in all this family\'s way of looking at\r\nthings," thought the mar\xc3\xa9chale; "they are infatuated with their young\r\nabb\xc3\xa9, whose only accomplishment is to be a good listener, though his\r\neyes are fine enough, it is true."\r\n\r\nJulien, on his side, found in the mar\xc3\xa9chale\'s manners an almost perfect\r\ninstance of that patrician calm which exhales a scrupulous politeness;\r\nand, what is more, announces at the same time the impossibility of\r\nany violent emotion. Madame de Fervaques would have been as much\r\nscandalised by any unexpected movement or any lack of self-control, as\r\nby a lack of dignity towards one\'s inferiors. She would have regarded\r\nthe slightest symptom of sensibility as a kind of moral drunkenness\r\nwhich puts one to the blush and was extremely prejudicial to what a\r\nperson of high rank owed to herself. Her great happiness was to talk of\r\nthe king\'s last hunt; her favourite book, was the Memoirs of the Duke\r\nde Saint Simon, especially the genealogical part.\r\n\r\nJulien knew the place where the arrangement of the light suited madame\r\nde Fervaques\' particular style of beauty. He got there in advance, but\r\nwas careful to turn his chair in such a way as not to see Mathilde.\r\n\r\nAstonished one day at this consistent policy of hiding himself from\r\nher, she left the blue sofa and came to work by the little table near\r\nthe mar\xc3\xa9chale\'s armchair. Julien had a fairly close view of her over\r\nmadame de Fervaques\' hat.\r\n\r\nThose eyes, which were the arbiters of his fate, frightened him, and\r\nthen hurled him violently out of his habitual apathy. He talked, and\r\ntalked very well.\r\n\r\nHe was speaking to the mar\xc3\xa9chale, but his one aim was to produce an\r\nimpression upon Mathilde\'s soul. He became so animated that eventually\r\nmadame de Fervaques did not manage to understand a word he said.\r\n\r\nThis was a prime merit. If it had occurred to Julien to follow it up by\r\nsome phrases of German mysticism, lofty religion, and Jesuitism, the\r\nmar\xc3\xa9chale would have immediately given him a rank among the superior\r\nmen whose mission it was to regenerate the age.\r\n\r\n"Since he has bad enough taste," said mademoiselle de la Mole, "to talk\r\nso long and so ardently to madame de Fervaques, I shall not listen to\r\nhim any more." She kept her resolution during the whole latter part of\r\nthe evening, although she had difficulty in doing so.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, when she took her mother\'s candle to accompany her to\r\nher room, madame de la Mole stopped on the staircase to enter into an\r\nexhaustive eulogy of Julien. Mathilde ended by losing her temper. She\r\ncould not get to sleep. She felt calmed by this thought: "the very\r\nthings which I despise in a man may none the less constitute a great\r\nmerit in the eyes of the mar\xc3\xa9chale."\r\n\r\nAs for Julien, he had done something, he was less unhappy; his eyes\r\nchanced to fall on the Russian leather portfolio in which prince\r\nKorasoff had placed the fifty-three love letters which he had presented\r\nto him. Julien saw a note at the bottom of the first letter: No. 1 is\r\nsent eight days after the first meeting.\r\n\r\n"I am behind hand," exclaimed Julien. "It is quite a long time since I\r\nmet madame de Fervaques." He immediately began to copy out this first\r\nlove letter. It was a homily packed with moral platitudes and deadly\r\ndull. Julien was fortunate enough to fall asleep at the second page.\r\n\r\nSome hours afterwards he was surprised to see the broad daylight as he\r\nlent on his desk. The most painful moments in his life were those when\r\nhe woke up every morning to realise his unhappiness. On this particular\r\nday he finished copying out his letter in a state verging on laughter.\r\n"Is it possible," he said to himself, "that there ever lived a young\r\nman who actually wrote like that." He counted several sentences of nine\r\nlines each. At the bottom of the original he noticed a pencilled note.\r\n"These letters are delivered personally, on horseback, black cravat,\r\nblue tail-coat. You give the letter to the porter with a contrite air;\r\nexpression of profound melancholy. If you notice any chambermaid, dry\r\nyour eyes furtively and speak to her."\r\n\r\nAll this was duly carried out.\r\n\r\n"I am taking a very bold course!" thought Julien as he came out of the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel de Fervaques, "but all the worse for Korasoff. To think of daring\r\nto write to so virtuous a celebrity. I shall be treated with the utmost\r\ncontempt, and nothing will amuse me more. It is really the only comedy\r\nthat I can in any way appreciate. Yes, it will amuse me to load with\r\nridicule that odious creature whom I call myself. If I believed in\r\nmyself, I would commit some crime to distract myself."\r\n\r\nThe moment when Julien brought his horse back to the stable was the\r\nhappiest he had experienced for a whole month. Korasoff had expressly\r\nforbidden him to look at the mistress who had left him, on any pretext\r\nwhatsoever. But the step of that horse, which she knew so well, and\r\nJulien\'s way of knocking on the stable door with his riding-whip to\r\ncall a man, sometimes attracted Mathilde to behind the window-curtain.\r\nThe muslin was so light that Julien could see through it. By looking\r\nunder the brim of his hat in a certain way, he could get a view of\r\nMathilde\'s figure without seeing her eyes. "Consequently," he said to\r\nhimself, "she cannot see mine, and that is not really looking at her."\r\n\r\nIn the evening madame de Fervaques behaved towards him, exactly as\r\nthough she had never received the philosophic mystical and religious\r\ndissertation which he had given to her porter in the morning with so\r\nmelancholy an air. Chance had shown Julien on the preceding day how\r\nto be eloquent; he placed himself in such a position that he could\r\nsee Mathilde\'s eyes. She, on her side, left the blue sofa a minute\r\nafter the mar\xc3\xa9chale\'s arrival; this involved abandoning her usual\r\nassociates. M. de Croisenois seemed overwhelmed by this new caprice:\r\nhis palpable grief alleviated the awfulness of Julien\'s agony.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected turn in his life made him talk like an angel, and\r\ninasmuch as a certain element of self-appreciation will insinuate\r\nitself even into those hearts which serve as a temple for the\r\nmost august virtue, the mar\xc3\xa9chale said to herself as she got into\r\nher carriage, "Madame de la Mole is right, this young priest has\r\ndistinction. My presence must have overawed him at first. As a matter\r\nof fact, the whole tone of this house is very frivolous; I can see\r\nnothing but instances of virtue helped by oldness, and standing in\r\ngreat need of the chills of age. This young man must have managed to\r\nappreciate the difference; he writes well, but I fear very much that\r\nthis request of his in his letter for me to enlighten him with my\r\nadvice, is really nothing less than an, as yet, unconscious sentiment.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless how many conversions have begun like that! What makes me\r\nconsider this a good omen is the difference between his style and that\r\nof the young people whose letters I have had an opportunity of seeing.\r\nOne cannot avoid recognising unction, profound seriousness, and much\r\nconviction in the prose of this young acolyte; he has no doubt the\r\nsweet virtue of a Massillon."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\nTHE FINEST PLACES IN THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\n    Services! talents! merits! bah! belong to a c\xc3\xb4terie.\r\n                                               _T\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9maque_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of a bishopric had thus become associated with the idea of\r\nJulien in the mind of a woman, who would sooner or later have at her\r\ndisposal the finest places in the Church of France. This idea had not\r\nstruck Julien at all; at the present time his thoughts were strictly\r\nlimited to his actual unhappiness. Everything tended to intensify\r\nit. The sight of his room, for instance, had become unbearable. When\r\nhe came back in the evening with his candle, each piece of furniture\r\nand each little ornament seemed to become articulate, and to announce\r\nharshly some new phase of his unhappiness.\r\n\r\n"I have a hard task before me today," he said to himself as he came in\r\nwith a vivacity which he had not experienced for a long time; "let us\r\nhope that the second letter will be as boring as the first."\r\n\r\nIt was more so. What he was copying seemed so absurd that he finished\r\nup by transcribing it line for line without thinking of the sense.\r\n\r\n"It is even more bombastic," he said to himself, "than those official\r\ndocuments of the treaty of Munster which my professor of diplomacy made\r\nme copy out at London."\r\n\r\nIt was only then that he remembered madame de Fervaque\'s letters which\r\nhe had forgotten to give back to the grave Spaniard Don Diego Bustos.\r\nHe found them. They were really almost as nonsensical as those of\r\nthe young Russian nobleman. Their vagueness was unlimited. It meant\r\neverything and nothing. "It\'s the \xc3\x86olian harp of style," thought\r\nJulien. "The only real thing I see in the middle of all these lofty\r\nthoughts about annihilation, death, infinity, etc., is an abominable\r\nfear of ridicule."\r\n\r\nThe monologue which we have just condensed was repeated for fifteen\r\ndays on end. Falling off to sleep as he copied out a sort of commentary\r\non the Apocalypse, going with a melancholy expression to deliver it\r\nthe following day, taking his horse back to the stable in the hope\r\nof catching sight of Mathilde\'s dress, working, going in the evening\r\nto the opera on those evenings when madame de Fervaques did not come\r\nto the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole, such were the monotonous events in Julien\'s\r\nlife. His life had more interest, when madame la Fervaques visited the\r\nmarquise; he could then catch a glimpse of Mathilde\'s eyes underneath\r\na feather of the mar\xc3\xa9chale\'s hat, and he would wax eloquent. His\r\npicturesque and sentimental phrases began to assume a style, which was\r\nboth more striking and more elegant.\r\n\r\nHe quite realised that what he said was absurd in Mathilde\'s eyes, but\r\nhe wished to impress her by the elegance of his diction. "The falser my\r\nspeeches are the more I ought to please," thought Julien, and he then\r\nhad the abominable audacity to exaggerate certain elements in his own\r\ncharacter. He soon appreciated that to avoid appearing vulgar in the\r\neyes of the mar\xc3\xa9chale it was necessary to eschew simple and rational\r\nideas. He would continue on these lines, or would cut short his grand\r\neloquence according as he saw appreciation or indifference in the eyes\r\nof the two great ladies whom he had set out to please.\r\n\r\nTaking it all round, his life was less awful than when his days were\r\npassed in inaction.\r\n\r\n"But," he said to himself one evening, "here I am copying out the\r\nfifteenth of these abominable dissertations; the first fourteen have\r\nbeen duly delivered to the mar\xc3\xa9chale\'s porter. I shall have the honour\r\nof filling all the drawers in her escritoire. And yet she treats me\r\nas though I never wrote. What can be the end of all this? Will my\r\nconstancy bore her as much as it does me? I must admit that that\r\nRussian friend of Korasoff\'s who was in love with the pretty Quakeress\r\nof Richmond, was a terrible man in his time; no one could be more\r\noverwhelming."\r\n\r\nLike all mediocre individuals, who chance to come into contact with the\r\nman\xc5\x93uvres of a great general, Julien understood nothing of the attack\r\nexecuted by the young Russian on the heart of the young English girl.\r\nThe only purpose of the first forty letters was to secure forgiveness\r\nfor the boldness of writing at all. The sweet person, who perhaps lived\r\na life of inordinate boredom, had to be induced to contract the habit\r\nof receiving letters, which were perhaps a little less insipid than her\r\neveryday life.\r\n\r\nOne morning a letter was delivered to Julien. He recognised the arms\r\nof madame la Fervaques, and broke the seal with an eagerness which\r\nwould have seemed impossible to him some days before. It was only an\r\ninvitation to dinner.\r\n\r\nHe rushed to prince Korasoffs instructions. Unfortunately the young\r\nRussian had taken it into his head to be as flippant as Dorat, just\r\nwhen he should have been simple and intelligible! Julien was not able\r\nto form any idea of the moral position which he ought to take up at the\r\nmar\xc3\xa9chale\'s dinner.\r\n\r\nThe salon was extremely magnificent and decorated like the gallery de\r\nDiane in the Tuileries with panelled oil-paintings.\r\n\r\nThere were some light spots on these pictures. Julien learnt later that\r\nthe mistress of the house had thought the subject somewhat lacking in\r\ndecency and that she had had the pictures corrected. "What a moral\r\ncentury!" he thought.\r\n\r\nHe noticed in this salon three of the persons who had been present\r\nat the drawing up of the secret note. One of them, my lord bishop of\r\n---- the mar\xc3\xa9chale\'s uncle had the disposition of the ecclesiastical\r\npatronage, and could, it was said, refuse his niece nothing. "What\r\nimmense progress I have made," said Julien to himself with a melancholy\r\nsmile, "and how indifferent I am to it. Here I am dining with the\r\nfamous bishop of ----."\r\n\r\nThe dinner was mediocre and the conversation wearisome.\r\n\r\n"It\'s like the small talk in a bad book," thought Julien. "All the\r\ngreatest subjects of human thought are proudly tackled. After listening\r\nfor three minutes one asks oneself which is greater--the speaker\'s\r\nbombast, or his abominable ignorance?"\r\n\r\nThe reader has doubtless forgotten the little man of letters named\r\nTanbeau, who was the nephew of the Academician, and intended to be\r\nprofessor, who seemed entrusted with the task of poisoning the salon of\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole with his base calumnies.\r\n\r\nIt was this little man who gave Julien the first inkling that though,\r\nmadame de Fervaques did not answer, she might quite well take an\r\nindulgent view of the sentiment which dictated them. M. Tanbeau\'s\r\nsinister soul was lacerated by the thought of Julien\'s success; "but\r\nsince, on the other hand, a man of merit cannot be in two places at the\r\nsame time any more than a fool," said the future professor to himself,\r\n"if Sorel becomes the lover of the sublime mar\xc3\xa9chale, she will obtain\r\nsome lucrative position for him in the church, and I shall be rid of\r\nhim in the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole."\r\n\r\nM. the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard addressed long sermons to Julien concerning his\r\nsuccess at the hotel de Fervaques. There was a sectarian jealousy\r\nbetween the austere Jansenist and the salon of the virtuous mar\xc3\xa9chale\r\nwhich was Jesuitical, reactionary, and monarchical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\nMANON LESCAUT\r\n\r\n\r\n        Accordingly once he was thoroughly convinced of the\r\n        asinine stupidity of the prior, he would usually succeed\r\n        well enough by calling white black, and black white.\r\n        _Lichtenberg_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian instructions peremptorily forbade the writer from ever\r\ncontradicting in conversation the recipient of the letters. No pretext\r\ncould excuse any deviation from the r\xc3\xb4le of that most ecstatic\r\nadmiration. The letters were always based on that hypothesis.\r\n\r\nOne evening at the opera, when in madame de Fervaques\' box, Julien\r\nspoke of the ballet of _Manon Lescaut_ in the most enthusiastic terms.\r\nHis only reason for talking in that strain was the fact that he thought\r\nit insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe mar\xc3\xa9chale said that the ballet was very inferior to the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nPr\xc3\xa9vost\'s novel.\r\n\r\n"The idea," thought Julien, both surprised and amused, "of so highly\r\nvirtuous a person praising a novel! Madame de Fervaques used to profess\r\ntwo or three times a week the most absolute contempt for those writers,\r\nwho, by means of their insipid works, try to corrupt a youth which is,\r\nalas! only too inclined to the errors of the senses."\r\n\r\n"_Manon Lescaut_" continued the mar\xc3\xa9chale, "is said to be one of the\r\nbest of this immoral and dangerous type of book. The weaknesses and the\r\ndeserved anguish of a criminal heart are, they say, portrayed with a\r\ntruth which is not lacking in depth; a fact which does not prevent your\r\nBonaparte from stating at St. Helena that it is simply a novel written\r\nfor lackeys."\r\n\r\nThe word Bonaparte restored to Julien all the activity of his mind.\r\n"They have tried to ruin me with the mar\xc3\xa9chale; they have told her of\r\nmy enthusiasm for Napoleon. This fact has sufficiently piqued her to\r\nmake her yield to the temptation to make me feel it." This discovery\r\namused him all the evening, and rendered him amusing. As he took leave\r\nof the mar\xc3\xa9chale in the vestibule of the opera, she said to him,\r\n"Remember, monsieur, one must not like Bonaparte if you like me; at\r\nthe best he can only be accepted as a necessity imposed by Providence.\r\nBesides, the man did not have a sufficiently supple soul to appreciate\r\nmasterpieces of art."\r\n\r\n"When you like me," Julien kept on repeating to himself, "that means\r\nnothing or means everything. Here we have mysteries of language which\r\nare beyond us poor provincials." And he thought a great deal about\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal, as he copied out an immense letter destined for the\r\nmar\xc3\xa9chale.\r\n\r\n"How is it," she said to him the following day, with an assumed\r\nindifference which he thought was clumsily assumed, "that you talk to\r\nme about London and Richmond in a letter which you wrote last night, I\r\nthink, when you came back from the opera?"\r\n\r\nJulien was very embarrassed. He had copied line by line without\r\nthinking about what he was writing, and had apparently forgotten to\r\nsubstitute Paris and Saint Cloud for the words London and Richmond\r\nwhich occurred in the original. He commenced two or three sentences,\r\nbut found it impossible to finish them. He felt on the point of\r\nsuccumbing to a fit of idiotic laughter. Finally by picking his words\r\nhe succeeded in formulating this inspiration: "Exalted as I was by the\r\ndiscussion of the most sublime and greatest interests of the human\r\nsoul, my own soul may have been somewhat absent in my letter to you."\r\n\r\n"I am making an impression," he said to himself, "so I can spare myself\r\nthe boredom of the rest of the evening." He left the H\xc3\xb4tel de Fervaques\r\nat a run. In the evening he had another look at the original of the\r\nletter which he had copied out on the previous night, and soon came to\r\nthe fatal place where the young Russian made mention of London and of\r\nRichmond. Julien was very astonished to find this letter almost tender.\r\n\r\nIt had been the contrast between the apparent lightness of his\r\nconversation, and the sublime and almost apocalyptic profundity of\r\nhis letters which had marked him out for favour. The mar\xc3\xa9chale was\r\nparticularly pleased by the longness of the sentences; this was very\r\nfar from being that sprightly style which that immoral man Voltaire\r\nhad brought into fashion. Although our hero made every possible human\r\neffort to eliminate from his conversation any symptom of good sense, it\r\nstill preserved a certain anti-monarchical and blasphemous tinge which\r\ndid not escape madame de Fervaques. Surrounded as she was by persons\r\nwho, though eminently moral, had very often not a single idea during a\r\nwhole evening, this lady was profoundly struck by anything resembling\r\na novelty, but at the same time she thought she owed it to herself to\r\nbe offended by it. She called this defect: Keeping the imprint of the\r\nlightness of the age.\r\n\r\nBut such salons are only worth observing when one has a favour to\r\nprocure. The reader doubtless shares all the ennui of the colourless\r\nlife which Julien was leading. This period represents the steppes of\r\nour journey.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole needed to exercise her self-control to avoid\r\nthinking of Julien during the whole period filled by the de Fervaques\r\nepisode. Her soul was a prey to violent battles; sometimes she piqued\r\nherself on despising that melancholy young man, but his conversation\r\ncaptivated her in spite of herself. She was particularly astonished by\r\nhis absolute falseness. He did not say a single word to the mar\xc3\xa9chale\r\nwhich was not a lie, or at any rate, an abominable travesty of his own\r\nway of thinking, which Mathilde knew so perfectly in every phase. This\r\nMachiavellianism impressed her. "What subtlety," she said to herself.\r\n"What a difference between the bombastic coxcombs, or the common\r\nrascals like Tanbeau who talk in the same strain."\r\n\r\nNevertheless Julien went through awful days. It was only to accomplish\r\nthe most painful of duties that he put in a daily appearance in the\r\nmar\xc3\xa9chale\'s salon.\r\n\r\nThe strain of playing a part ended by depriving his mind of all its\r\nstrength. As he crossed each night the immense courtyard of the H\xc3\xb4tel\r\nde Fervaques, it was only through sheer force in character and logic\r\nthat he succeeded in keeping a little above the level of despair.\r\n\r\n"I overcame despair at the seminary," he said, "yet what an awful\r\nprospect I had then. I was then either going to make my fortune or\r\ncome to grief just as I am now. I found myself obliged to pass all my\r\nlife in intimate association with the most contemptible and disgusting\r\nthings in the whole world. The following spring, just eleven short\r\nmonths later, I was perhaps the happiest of all young people of my own\r\nage."\r\n\r\nBut very often all this fine logic proved unavailing against the awful\r\nreality. He saw Mathilde every day at breakfast and at dinner. He knew\r\nfrom the numerous letters which de la Mole dictated to him that she was\r\non the eve of marrying de Croisenois. This charming man already called\r\ntwice a day at the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole; the jealous eye of a jilted lover\r\nwas alive to every one of his movements. When he thought he had noticed\r\nthat mademoiselle de la Mole was beginning to encourage her intended,\r\nJulien could not help looking tenderly at his pistols as he went up to\r\nhis room.\r\n\r\n"Ah," he said to himself, "would it not be much wiser to take the marks\r\nout of my linen and to go into some solitary forest twenty leagues from\r\nParis to put an end to this atrocious life? I should be unknown in the\r\ndistrict, my death would remain a secret for a fortnight, and who would\r\nbother about me after a fortnight?"\r\n\r\nThis reasoning was very logical. But on the following day a glimpse of\r\nMathilde\'s arm between the sleeve of her dress and her glove sufficed\r\nto plunge our young philosopher into memories which, though agonising,\r\nnone the less gave him a hold on life. "Well," he said to himself, "I\r\nwill follow this Russian plan to the end. How will it all finish?"\r\n\r\n"So far as the mar\xc3\xa9chale is concerned, after I have copied out these\r\nfifty-three letters, I shall not write any others.\r\n\r\n"As for Mathilde, these six weeks of painful acting will either leave\r\nher anger unchanged, or will win me a moment of reconciliation. Great\r\nGod! I should die of happiness." And he could not finish his train of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAfter a long reverie he succeeded in taking up the thread of his\r\nargument. "In that case," he said to himself, "I should win one day of\r\nhappiness, and after that her cruelties which are based, alas, on my\r\nlack of ability to please her will recommence. I should have nothing\r\nleft to do, I should be ruined and lost for ever. With such a character\r\nas hers what guarantee can she give me? Alas! My manners are no doubt\r\nlacking in elegance, and my style of speech is heavy and monotonous.\r\nGreat God, why am I myself?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\nENNUI\r\n\r\n\r\n        Sacrificing one\'s self to one\'s passions, let it pass;\r\n        but sacrificing one\'s self to passions which one has not\r\n        got! Oh! melancholy nineteenth century!\r\n                                            _Girodet_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Fervaques had begun reading Julien\'s long letters without any\r\npleasure, but she now began to think about them; one thing, however,\r\ngrieved her. "What a pity that M. Sorel was not a real priest! He could\r\nthen be admitted to a kind of intimacy; but in view of that cross,\r\nand that almost lay dress, one is exposed to cruel questions and what\r\nis one to answer?" She did not finish the train of thought, "Some\r\nmalicious woman friend may think, and even spread it about that he is\r\nsome lower middle-class cousin or other, a relative of my father, some\r\ntradesman who has been decorated by the National Guard." Up to the\r\ntime which she had seen Julien, madame de Fervaque\'s greatest pleasure\r\nhad been writing the word mar\xc3\xa9chale after her name. Consequently a\r\nmorbid parvenu vanity, which was ready to take umbrage at everything,\r\ncombatted the awakening of her interest in him. "It would be so easy\r\nfor me," said the mar\xc3\xa9chale, "to make him a grand vicar in some diocese\r\nnear Paris! but plain M. Sorel, and what is more, a man who is the\r\nsecretary of M. de la Mole! It is heart-breaking."\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life this soul, which was afraid of\r\neverything, was moved by an interest which was alien to its own\r\npretensions to rank and superiority. Her old porter noticed that\r\nwhenever he brought a letter from this handsome young man, who always\r\nlooked so sad, he was certain to see that absent, discontented\r\nexpression, which the mar\xc3\xa9chale always made a point of assuming on the\r\nentry of any of her servants, immediately disappear. The boredom of a\r\nmode of life whose ambitions were concentrated on impressing the public\r\nwithout her having at heart any real faculty of enjoyment for that kind\r\nof success, had become so intolerable since she had begun to think of\r\nJulien that, all that was necessary to prevent her chambermaids being\r\nbullied for a whole day, was that their mistress should have passed\r\nan hour in the society of this strange young man on the evening of\r\nthe preceding day. His budding credit was proof against very cleverly\r\nwritten anonymous letters. It was in vain that Tanbeau supplied M. de\r\nLuz, de Croisenois, de Caylus, with two or three very clever calumnies\r\nwhich these gentlemen were only too glad to spread, without making\r\ntoo many enquiries of the actual truth of the charges. The mar\xc3\xa9chale,\r\nwhose temperament was not calculated to be proof against these vulgar\r\nexpedients related her doubts to Mathilde, and was always consoled by\r\nher.\r\n\r\nOne day, madame de Fervaques, after having asked three times if there\r\nwere any letters for her, suddenly decided to answer Julien. It was a\r\ncase of the triumph of ennui. On reaching the second letter in his name\r\nthe mar\xc3\xa9chale almost felt herself pulled up sharp by the unbecomingness\r\nof writing with her own hand so vulgar an address as to M. Sorel, care\r\nof M. le Marquis de la Mole.\r\n\r\n"You must bring me envelopes with your address on," she said very drily\r\nto Julien in the evening. "Here I am appointed lover and valet in one,"\r\nthought Julien, and he bowed, amused himself by wrinkling his face up\r\nlike Ars\xc3\xa8ne, the old valet of the marquis.\r\n\r\nHe brought the envelopes that very evening, and he received the third\r\nletter very early on the following day: he read five or six lines at\r\nthe beginning, and two or three towards the end. There were four pages\r\nof a small and very close writing. The lady gradually developed the\r\nsweet habit of writing nearly every day. Julien answered by faithful\r\ncopies of the Russian letters; and such is the advantage of the\r\nbombastic style that madame de Fervaques was not a bit astonished by\r\nthe lack of connection between his answers and her letters. How gravely\r\nirritated would her pride have been if the little Tanbeau who had\r\nconstituted himself a voluntary spy on all Julien\'s movements had been\r\nable to have informed her that all these letters were left unsealed and\r\nthrown haphazard into Julien\'s drawer.\r\n\r\nOne morning the porter was bringing into the library a letter to him\r\nfrom the mar\xc3\xa9chale. Mathilde met the man, saw the letter together with\r\nthe address in Julien\'s handwriting. She entered the library as the\r\nporter was leaving it, the letter was still on the edge of the table.\r\nJulien was very busy with his work and had not yet put it in his drawer.\r\n\r\n"I cannot endure this," exclaimed Mathilde, as she took possession\r\nof the letter, "you are completely forgetting me, me your wife, your\r\nconduct is awful, monsieur."\r\n\r\nAt these words her pride, shocked by the awful unseemliness of her\r\nproceeding, prevented her from speaking. She burst into tears, and soon\r\nseemed to Julien scarcely able to breathe.\r\n\r\nJulien was so surprised and embarrassed that he did not fully\r\nappreciate how ideally fortunate this scene was for himself. He helped\r\nMathilde to sit down; she almost abandoned herself in his arms.\r\n\r\nThe first minute in which he noticed this movement, he felt an extreme\r\njoy. Immediately afterwards, he thought of Korasoff: "I may lose\r\neverything by a single word."\r\n\r\nThe strain of carrying out his tactics was so great that his arms\r\nstiffened. "I dare not even allow myself to press this supple, charming\r\nframe to my heart, or she will despise me or treat me badly. What an\r\nawful character!" And while he cursed Mathilde\'s character, he loved\r\nher a hundred times more. He thought he had a queen in his arms.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s impassive coldness intensified the anguished pride which was\r\nlacerating the soul of mademoiselle de la Mole. She was far from having\r\nthe necessary self-possession to try and read in his eyes what he felt\r\nfor her at that particular moment. She could not make up her mind to\r\nlook at him. She trembled lest she might encounter a contemptuous\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nSeated motionless on the library divan, with her head turned in the\r\nopposite direction to Julien, she was a prey to the most poignant\r\nanguish that pride and love can inflict upon a human soul. What an\r\nawful step had she just slipped into taking! "It has been reserved\r\nfor me, unhappy woman that I am, to see my most unbecoming advances\r\nrebuffed! and rebuffed by whom?" added her maddened and wounded pride;\r\n"rebuffed by a servant of my father\'s! That\'s more than I will put up\r\nwith," she said aloud, and rising in a fury, she opened the drawer of\r\nJulien\'s table, which was two yards in front of her.\r\n\r\nShe stood petrified with horror when she saw eight or ten unopened\r\nletters, completely like the one the porter had just brought up. She\r\nrecognised Julien\'s handwriting, though more or less disguised, on all\r\nthe addresses.\r\n\r\n"So," she cried, quite beside herself, "you are not only on good terms\r\nwith her, but you actually despise her. You, a nobody, despise madame\r\nla mar\xc3\xa9chale de Fervaques!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, forgive me, my dear," she added, throwing herself on her knees;\r\n"despise me if you wish, but love me. I cannot live without your love."\r\nAnd she fell down in a dead faint.\r\n\r\n"So our proud lady is lying at my feet," said Julien to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\nA BOX AT THE BOUFFES\r\n\r\n\r\n   As the blackest sky\r\nForetells the heaviest tempest\r\n               _Don Juan, c._ 1. _st_.76.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these great transports Julien felt more surprised than\r\nhappy. Mathilde\'s abuse proved to him the shrewdness of the Russian\r\ntactics. "\'Few words, few deeds,\' that is my one method of salvation."\r\nHe picked up Mathilde, and without saying a word, put her back on the\r\ndivan. She was gradually being overcome by tears.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep herself in countenance, she took madame de Fervaques\'\r\nletters in her hands, and slowly broke the seals. She gave a noticeable\r\nnervous movement when she recognised the mar\xc3\xa9chale\'s handwriting. She\r\nturned over the pages of these letters without reading them. Most of\r\nthem were six pages.\r\n\r\n"At least answer me," Mathilde said at last, in the most supplicatory\r\ntone, but without daring to look at Julien: "You know how proud I am.\r\nIt is the misfortune of my position, and of my temperament, too, I\r\nconfess. Has madame de Fervaques robbed me of your heart? Has she made\r\nthe sacrifices to which my fatal love swept me?"\r\n\r\nA dismal silence was all Julien\'s answer. "By what right," he thought,\r\n"does she ask me to commit an indiscretion unworthy of an honest man?"\r\nMathilde tried to read the letters; her eyes were so wet with tears\r\nthat it was impossible for her to do so. She had been unhappy for a\r\nmonth past, but this haughty soul had been very far from owning its own\r\nfeelings even to itself. Chance alone had brought about this explosion.\r\nFor one instant jealousy and love had won a victory over pride. She\r\nwas sitting on the divan, and very near him. He saw her hair and her\r\nalabaster neck. For a moment he forgot all he owed to himself. He\r\npassed his arm around her waist, and clasped her almost to his breast.\r\n\r\nShe slowly turned her head towards him. He was astonished by the\r\nextreme anguish in her eyes. There was not a trace of their usual\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nJulien felt his strength desert him. So great was the deadly pain of\r\nthe courageous feat which he was imposing on himself.\r\n\r\n"Those eyes will soon express nothing but the coldest disdain," said\r\nJulien to himself, "if I allow myself to be swept away by the happiness\r\nof loving her." She, however, kept repeatedly assuring him at this\r\nmoment, in a hushed voice, and in words which she had scarcely the\r\nstrength to finish, of all her remorse for those steps which her\r\ninordinate pride had dictated.\r\n\r\n"I, too, have pride," said Julien to her, in a scarcely articulate\r\nvoice, while his features portrayed the lowest depths of physical\r\nprostration.\r\n\r\nMathilde turned round sharply towards him. Hearing his voice was a\r\nhappiness which she had given up hoping. At this moment her only\r\nthought of her haughtiness was to curse it. She would have liked to\r\nhave found out some abnormal and incredible actions, in order to prove\r\nto him the extent to which she adored him and detested herself.\r\n\r\n"That pride is probably the reason," continued Julien, "why you singled\r\nme out for a moment. My present courageous and manly firmness is\r\ncertainly the reason why you respect me. I may entertain love for the\r\nmar\xc3\xa9chale."\r\n\r\nMathilde shuddered; a strange expression came into her eyes. She was\r\ngoing to hear her sentence pronounced. This shudder did not escape\r\nJulien. He felt his courage weaken.\r\n\r\n"Ah," he said to himself, as he listened to the sound of the vain words\r\nwhich his mouth was articulating, as he thought it were some strange\r\nsound, "if I could only cover those pale cheeks with kisses without\r\nyour feeling it."\r\n\r\n"I may entertain love for the mar\xc3\xa9chale," he continued, while his voice\r\nbecame weaker and weaker, "but I certainly have no definite proof of\r\nher interest in me."\r\n\r\nMathilde looked at him. He supported that look. He hoped, at any rate,\r\nthat his expression had not betrayed him. He felt himself bathed in a\r\nlove that penetrated even into the most secret recesses of his heart.\r\nHe had never adored her so much; he was almost as mad as Mathilde. If\r\nshe had mustered sufficient self-possession and courage to man\xc5\x93uvre, he\r\nwould have abandoned all his play-acting, and fallen at her feet. He\r\nhad sufficient strength to manage to continue speaking: "Ah, Korasoff,"\r\nhe exclaimed mentally, "why are you not here? How I need a word from\r\nyou to guide me in my conduct." During this time his voice was saying,\r\n\r\n"In default of any other sentiment, gratitude would be sufficient to\r\nattach me to the mar\xc3\xa9chale. She has been indulgent to me; she has\r\nconsoled me when I have been despised. I cannot put unlimited faith\r\nin certain appearances which are, no doubt, extremely flattering, but\r\npossibly very fleeting."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God!" exclaimed Mathilde.\r\n\r\n"Well, what guarantee will you give me?" replied Julien with a sharp,\r\nfirm intonation, which seemed to abandon for a moment the prudent forms\r\nof diplomacy. "What guarantee, what god will warrant that the position\r\nto which you seem inclined to restore me at the present moment will\r\nlast more than two days?"\r\n\r\n"The excess of my love, and my unhappiness if you do not love me," she\r\nsaid to him, taking his hands and turning towards him.\r\n\r\nThe spasmodic movement which she had just made had slightly displaced\r\nher tippet; Julien caught a view of her charming shoulders. Her\r\nslightly dishevelled hair recalled a delicious memory....\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of succumbing. "One imprudent word," he said to\r\nhimself, "and I have to start all over again that long series of days\r\nwhich I have passed in despair. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal used to find reasons\r\nfor doing what her heart dictated. This young girl of high society\r\nnever allows her heart to be moved except when she has proved to\r\nherself by sound logic that it ought to be moved."\r\n\r\nHe saw this proof in the twinkling of an eye, and in the twinkling\r\nof an eye too, he regained his courage. He took away his hands which\r\nMathilde was pressing in her own, and moved a little away from her with\r\na marked respect.\r\n\r\nHuman courage could not go further. He then busied himself with\r\nputting together madame de Fervaque\'s letters which were spread out on\r\nthe divan, and it was with all the appearance of extreme politeness\r\nthat he cruelly exploited the psychological moment by adding,\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle de la Mole will allow me to reflect over all this." He\r\nwent rapidly away and left the library; she heard him shut all the\r\ndoors one after the other.\r\n\r\n"The monster is not the least bit troubled," she said to herself. "But\r\nwhat am I saying? Monster? He is wise, prudent, good. It is I myself\r\nwho have committed more wrong than one can imagine."\r\n\r\nThis point of view lasted. Mathilde was almost happy today, for she\r\ngave herself up to love unreservedly. One would have said that this\r\nsoul had never been disturbed by pride (and what pride!)\r\n\r\nShe shuddered with horror when a lackey announced madame le Fervaques\r\ninto the salon in the evening. The man\'s voice struck her as sinister.\r\nShe could not endure the sight of the mar\xc3\xa9chale, and stopped suddenly.\r\nJulien who had felt little pride over his painful victory, had feared\r\nto face her, and had not dined at the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole.\r\n\r\nHis love and his happiness rapidly increased in proportion to the time\r\nthat elapsed from the moment of the battle. He was blaming himself\r\nalready. "How could I resist her?" he said to himself. "Suppose she\r\nwere to go and leave off loving me! One single moment may change that\r\nhaughty soul, and I must admit that I have treated her awfully."\r\n\r\nIn the evening he felt that it was absolutely necessary to put in\r\nan appearance at the Bouffes in madame de Fervaques\' box. She had\r\nexpressly invited him. Mathilde would be bound to know of his presence\r\nor his discourteous absence. In spite of the clearness of this logic,\r\nhe could not at the beginning of the evening bring himself to plunge\r\ninto society. By speaking he would lose half his happiness. Ten o\'clock\r\nstruck and it was absolutely necessary to show himself. Luckily he\r\nfound the mar\xc3\xa9chale\'s box packed with women, and was relegated to a\r\nplace near the door where he was completely hidden by the hats. This\r\nposition saved him from looking ridiculous; Caroline\'s divine notes of\r\ndespair in the _Matrimonio Segreto_ made him burst into tears. Madame\r\nde Fervaques saw these tears. They represented so great a contrast\r\nwith the masculine firmness of his usual expression that the soul\r\nof the old-fashioned lady, saturated as it had been for many years\r\nwith all the corroding acid of parvenu haughtiness, was none the less\r\ntouched. Such remnants of a woman\'s heart as she still possessed\r\nimpelled her to speak: she wanted to enjoy the sound of his voice at\r\nthis moment.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen the de la Mole ladies?" she said to him. "They are\r\nin the third tier." Julien immediately craned out over the theatre,\r\nleaning politely enough on the front of the box. He saw Mathilde; her\r\neyes were shining with tears.\r\n\r\n"And yet it is not their Opera day," thought Julien; "how eager she\r\nmust be!"\r\n\r\nMathilde had prevailed on her mother to come to the Bouffes in spite\r\nof the inconveniently high tier of the box, which a lady friend of the\r\nfamily had hastened to offer her. She wanted to see if Julien would\r\npass the evening with the mar\xc3\xa9chale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\nFRIGHTEN HER\r\n\r\n\r\n        So this is the fine miracle of your civilisation; you\r\n        have turned love into an ordinary business.--_Barnave_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien rushed into madame de la Mole\'s box. His eyes first met the\r\ntearful eyes of Mathilde; she was crying without reserve. There were\r\nonly insignificant personages present, the friend who had leant her\r\nbox, and some men whom she knew. Mathilde placed her hand on Julien\'s;\r\nshe seemed to have forgotten all fear of her mother. Almost stifled as\r\nshe was by her tears, she said nothing but this one word: "Guarantees!"\r\n\r\n"So long as I don\'t speak to her," said Julien to himself. He was\r\nhimself very moved, and concealed his eyes with his hand as best\r\nhe could under the pretext of avoiding the dazzling light of the\r\nthird tier of boxes. "If I speak she may suspect the excess of my\r\nemotion, the sound of my voice will betray me. All may yet be lost."\r\nHis struggles were more painful than they had been in the morning,\r\nhis soul had had the time to become moved. He had been frightened at\r\nseeing Mathilde piqued with vanity. Intoxicated as he was with love and\r\npleasure he resolved not to speak.\r\n\r\nIn my view this is one of the finest traits in his character, an\r\nindividual capable of such an effort of self-control may go far si\r\n_fata sinant_.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole insisted on taking Julien back to the h\xc3\xb4tel.\r\nLuckily it was raining a great deal, but the marquise had him placed\r\nopposite her, talked to him incessantly, and prevented him saying a\r\nsingle word to her daughter. One might have thought that the marquise\r\nwas nursing Julien\'s happiness for him; no longer fearing to lose\r\neverything through his excessive emotion, he madly abandoned himself to\r\nhis happiness.\r\n\r\nShall I dare to say that when he went back to his room Julien fell\r\non his knees and covered with kisses the love letters which prince\r\nKorasoff had given him.\r\n\r\n"How much I owe you, great man," he exclaimed in his madness. Little\r\nby little he regained his self-possession. He compared himself to a\r\ngeneral who had just won a great battle. "My advantage is definite and\r\nimmense," he said to himself, "but what will happen to-morrow? One\r\ninstant may ruin everything."\r\n\r\nWith a passionate gesture he opened the _Memoirs_ which Napoleon had\r\ndictated at St. Helena and for two long hours forced himself to read\r\nthem. Only his eyes read; no matter, he made himself do it. During this\r\nsingular reading his head and his heart rose to the most exalted level\r\nand worked unconsciously. "Her heart is very different from madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal\'s," he said to himself, but he did not go further.\r\n\r\n"Frighten her!" he suddenly exclaimed, hurling away the book. "The\r\nenemy will only obey me in so far as I frighten him, but then he will\r\nnot dare to show contempt for me."\r\n\r\nIntoxicated with joy he walked up and down his little room. In point of\r\nfact his happiness was based rather on pride than on love.\r\n\r\n"Frighten her!" he repeated proudly, and he had cause to be proud.\r\n\r\n"Madame de R\xc3\xaanal always doubted even in her happiest moments if my\r\nlove was equal to her own. In this case I have to subjugate a demon,\r\nconsequently I must subjugate her." He knew quite well that Mathilde\r\nwould be in the library at eight o\'clock in the morning of the\r\nfollowing day. He did not appear before nine o\'clock. He was burning\r\nwith love, but his head dominated his heart.\r\n\r\nScarcely a single minute passed without his repeating to himself. "Keep\r\nher obsessed by this great doubt. Does he love me?" Her own brilliant\r\nposition, together with the flattery of all who speak to her, tend a\r\nlittle too much to make her reassure herself.\r\n\r\nHe found her sitting on the divan pale and calm, but apparently\r\ncompletely incapable of making a single movement. She held out her\r\nhand,\r\n\r\n"Dear one, it is true I have offended you, perhaps you are angry with\r\nme."\r\n\r\nJulien had not been expecting this simple tone. He was on the point of\r\nbetraying himself.\r\n\r\n"You want guarantees, my dear, she added after a silence which she had\r\nhoped would be broken. Take me away, let us leave for London. I shall\r\nbe ruined, dishonoured for ever." She had the courage to take her hand\r\naway from Julien to cover her eyes with it.\r\n\r\nAll her feelings of reserve and feminine virtue had come back into her\r\nsoul. "Well, dishonour me," she said at last with a sigh, "that will be\r\na guarantee."\r\n\r\n"I was happy yesterday, because I had the courage to be severe with\r\nmyself," thought Julien. After a short silence he had sufficient\r\ncontrol over his heart to say in an icy tone,\r\n\r\n"Once we are on the road to London, once you are dishonoured, to employ\r\nyour own expression, who will answer that you will still love me? that\r\nmy very presence in the post-chaise will not seem importunate? I am not\r\na monster; to have ruined your reputation will only make me still more\r\nunhappy. It is not your position in society which is the obstacle, it\r\nis unfortunately your own character. Can you yourself guarantee that\r\nyou will love me for eight days?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! let her love me for eight days, just eight days," whispered\r\nJulien to himself, "and I will die of happiness. What do I care for\r\nthe future, what do I care for life? And yet if I wish that divine\r\nhappiness can commence this very minute, it only depends on me."\r\n\r\nMathilde saw that he was pensive.\r\n\r\n"So I am completely unworthy of you," she said to him, taking his hand.\r\n\r\nJulien kissed her, but at the same time the iron hand of duty gripped\r\nhis heart. If she sees how much I adore her I shall lose her. And\r\nbefore leaving her arms, he had reassumed all that dignity which is\r\nproper to a man.\r\n\r\nHe managed on this and the following days to conceal his inordinate\r\nhappiness. There were moments when he even refused himself the pleasure\r\nof clasping her in his arms. At other times the delirium of happiness\r\nprevailed over all the counsels of prudence.\r\n\r\nHe had been accustomed to station himself near a bower of honeysuckle\r\nin the garden arranged in such a way so as to conceal the ladder when\r\nhe had looked up at Mathilde\'s blind in the distance, and lamented her\r\ninconstancy. A very big oak tree was quite near, and the trunk of that\r\ntree prevented him from being seen by the indiscreet.\r\n\r\nAs he passed with Mathilde over this very place which recalled his\r\nexcessive unhappiness so vividly, the contrast between his former\r\ndespair and his present happiness proved too much for his character.\r\nTears inundated his eyes, and he carried his sweetheart\'s hand to his\r\nlips: "It was here I used to live in my thoughts of you, it was from\r\nhere that I used to look at that blind, and waited whole hours for the\r\nhappy moment when I would see that hand open it."\r\n\r\nHis weakness was unreserved. He portrayed the extremity of his former\r\ndespair in genuine colours which could not possibly have been invented.\r\nShort interjections testified to that present happiness which had put\r\nan end to that awful agony.\r\n\r\n"My God, what am I doing?" thought Julien, suddenly recovering himself.\r\n"I am ruining myself."\r\n\r\nIn his excessive alarm he thought that he already detected a diminution\r\nof the love in mademoiselle de la Mole\'s eyes. It was an illusion, but\r\nJulien\'s face suddenly changed its expression and became overspread\r\nby a mortal pallor. His eyes lost their fire, and an expression of\r\nhaughtiness touched with malice soon succeeded to his look of the most\r\ngenuine and unreserved love.\r\n\r\n"But what is the matter with you, my dear," said Mathilde to him, both\r\ntenderly and anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I am lying," said Julien irritably, "and I am lying to you. I am\r\nreproaching myself for it, and yet God knows that I respect you\r\nsufficiently not to lie to you. You love me, you are devoted to me, and\r\nI have no need of praises in order to please you."\r\n\r\n"Great heavens! are all the charming things you have been telling me\r\nfor the last two minutes mere phrases?"\r\n\r\n"And I reproach myself for it keenly, dear one. I once made them up for\r\na woman who loved me, and bored me--it is the weakness of my character.\r\nI denounce myself to you, forgive me."\r\n\r\nBitter tears streamed over Mathilde\'s cheeks.\r\n\r\n"As soon as some trifle offends me and throws me back on my\r\nmeditation," continued Julien, "my abominable memory, which I curse at\r\nthis very minute, offers me a resource, and I abuse it."\r\n\r\n"So I must have slipped, without knowing it, into some action which has\r\ndispleased you," said Mathilde with a charming simplicity.\r\n\r\n"I remember one day that when you passed near this honeysuckle you\r\npicked a flower, M. de Luz took it from you and you let him keep it. I\r\nwas two paces away."\r\n\r\n"M. de Luz? It is impossible," replied Mathilde with all her natural\r\nhaughtiness. "I do not do things like that."\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it," Julien replied sharply.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, it is true," said Mathilde, as she sadly lowered her\r\neyes. She knew positively that many months had elapsed since she had\r\nallowed M. de Luz to do such a thing.\r\n\r\nJulien looked at her with ineffable tenderness, "No," he said to\r\nhimself, "she does not love me less."\r\n\r\nIn the evening she rallied him with a laugh on his fancy for madame de\r\nFervaques. "Think of a bourgeois loving a parvenu, those are perhaps\r\nthe only type of hearts that my Julien cannot make mad with love. She\r\nhas made you into a real dandy," she said playing with his hair.\r\n\r\nDuring the period when he thought himself scorned by Mathilde, Julien\r\nhad become one of the best dressed men in Paris. He had, moreover,\r\na further advantage over other dandies, in as much as once he had\r\nfinished dressing he never gave a further thought to his appearance.\r\n\r\nOne thing still piqued Mathilde, Julien continued to copy out the\r\nRussian letters and send them to the mar\xc3\xa9chale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\nTHE TIGER\r\n\r\n\r\n        Alas, why these things and not other\r\n        things?--_Beaumarchais_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn English traveller tells of the intimacy in which he lived with a\r\ntiger. He had trained it and would caress it, but he always kept a\r\ncocked pistol on his table.\r\n\r\nJulien only abandoned himself to the fulness of his happiness in those\r\nmoments when Mathilde could not read the expression in his eyes. He\r\nscrupulously performed his duty of addressing some harsh word to her\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nWhen Mathilde\'s sweetness, which he noticed with some surprise,\r\ntogether with the completeness of her devotion were on the point of\r\ndepriving him of all self-control, he was courageous enough to leave\r\nher suddenly.\r\n\r\nMathilde loved for the first time in her life.\r\n\r\nLife had previously always dragged along at a tortoise pace, but now it\r\nflew.\r\n\r\nAs, however, her pride required to find a vent in some way or other,\r\nshe wished to expose herself to all the dangers in which her love could\r\ninvolve her. It was Julien who was prudent, and it was only when it was\r\na question of danger that she did not follow her own inclination; but\r\nsubmissive, and almost humble as she was when with him, she only showed\r\nadditional haughtiness to everyone in the house who came near her,\r\nwhether relatives or friends.\r\n\r\nIn the evening she would call Julien to her in the salon in the\r\npresence of sixty people, and have a long and private conversation with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe little Tanbeau installed himself one day close to them. She\r\nrequested him to go and fetch from the library the volume of Smollet\r\nwhich deals with the revolution of 1688, and when he hesitated, added\r\nwith an expression of insulting haughtiness, which was a veritable balm\r\nto Julien\'s soul, "Don\'t hurry."\r\n\r\n"Have you noticed that little monster\'s expression?" he said to her.\r\n\r\n"His uncle has been in attendance in this salon for ten or twelve\r\nyears, otherwise I would have had him packed off immediately."\r\n\r\nHer behaviour towards MM. de Croisenois, de Luz, etc., though outwardly\r\nperfectly polite, was in reality scarcely less provocative. Mathilde\r\nkeenly reproached herself for all the confidential remarks about them\r\nwhich she had formerly made to Julien, and all the more so since she\r\ndid not dare to confess that she had exaggerated to him the, in fact,\r\nalmost absolutely innocent manifestations of interest of which these\r\ngentlemen had been the objects. In spite of her best resolutions her\r\nwomanly pride invariably prevented her from saying to Julien, "It was\r\nbecause I was talking to you that I found a pleasure in describing my\r\nweakness in not drawing my hand away, when M. de Croisenois had placed\r\nhis on a marble table and had just touched it."\r\n\r\nBut now, as soon as one of these gentlemen had been speaking to her for\r\nsome moments, she found she had a question to put to Julien, and she\r\nmade this an excuse for keeping him by her side.\r\n\r\nShe discovered that she was _enceinte_ and joyfully informed Julien of\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\n"Do you doubt me now? Is it not a guarantee? I am your wife for ever."\r\n\r\nThis announcement struck Julien with profound astonishment. He was on\r\nthe point of forgetting the governing principle of his conduct. How am\r\nI to be deliberately cold and insulting towards this poor young girl,\r\nwho is ruining herself for my sake. And if she looked at all ill,\r\nhe could not, even on those days when the terrible voice of wisdom\r\nmade itself heard, find the courage to address to her one of those\r\nharsh remarks which his experience had found so indispensable to the\r\npreservation of their love.\r\n\r\n"I will write to my father," said Mathilde to him one day, "he is\r\nmore than a father to me, he is a friend; that being so, I think it\r\nunworthy both of you and of myself to try and deceive him, even for a\r\nsingle minute."\r\n\r\n"Great heavens, what are you going to do?" said Julien in alarm.\r\n\r\n"My duty," she answered with eyes shining with joy.\r\n\r\nShe thought she was showing more nobility than her lover.\r\n\r\n"But he will pack me off in disgrace."\r\n\r\n"It is his right to do so, we must respect it. I will give you my arm,\r\nand we will go out by the front door in full daylight."\r\n\r\nJulien was thunderstruck and requested her to put it off for a week.\r\n\r\n"I cannot," she answered, "it is the voice of honour, I have seen my\r\nduty, I must follow it, and follow it at once."\r\n\r\n"Well, I order you to put it off," said Julien at last. "Your honour\r\nis safe for the present. I am your husband. The position of us will be\r\nchanged by this momentous step. I too am within my rights. To-day is\r\nTuesday, next Tuesday is the duke de Retz\'s at home; when M. de la Mole\r\ncomes home in the evening the porter will give him the fatal letter.\r\nHis only thought is to make you a duchess, I am sure of it. Think of\r\nhis unhappiness."\r\n\r\n"You mean, think of his vengeance?"\r\n\r\n"It may be that I pity my benefactor, and am grieved at injuring him,\r\nbut I do not fear, and shall never fear anyone."\r\n\r\nMathilde yielded. This was the first occasion, since she had informed\r\nJulien of her condition, that he had spoken to her authoritatively.\r\nShe had never loved him so much. The tender part of his soul had\r\nfound happiness in seizing on Mathilde\'s condition as an excuse\r\nfor refraining from his cruel remarks to her. The question of the\r\nconfession to M. de la Mole deeply moved him. Was he going to be\r\nseparated from Mathilde? And, however grieved she would be to see him\r\ngo, would she have a thought for him after his departure?\r\n\r\nHe was almost equally horrified by the thought of the justified\r\nreproaches which the marquis might address to him.\r\n\r\nIn the evening he confessed to Mathilde the second reason for his\r\nanxiety, and then led away by his love, confessed the first as well.\r\n\r\nShe changed colour. "Would it really make you unhappy," she said to\r\nhim, "to pass six months far away from me?"\r\n\r\n"Infinitely so. It is the only thing in the world which terrifies me."\r\n\r\nMathilde was very happy. Julien had played his part so assiduously that\r\nhe had succeeded in making her think that she was the one of the two\r\nwho loved the more.\r\n\r\nThe fatal Tuesday arrived. When the marquis came in at midnight he\r\nfound a letter addressed to him, which was only to be opened himself\r\nwhen no one was there:--\r\n\r\n        "My father,\r\n\r\n        "All social ties have been broken between us, only those\r\n        of nature remain. Next to my husband, you are and always\r\n        will be the being I shall always hold most dear. My\r\n        eyes are full of tears, I am thinking of the pain that\r\n        I am causing you, but if my shame was to be prevented\r\n        from becoming public, and you were to be given time to\r\n        reflect and act, I could not postpone any longer the\r\n        confession that I owe you. If your affection for me,\r\n        which I know is extremely deep, is good enough to grant\r\n        me a small allowance, I will go and settle with my\r\n        husband anywhere you like, in Switzerland, for instance.\r\n        His name is so obscure that no one would recognize\r\n        in Madame Sorel, the daughter-in-law of a Verri\xc3\xa8res\r\n        carpenter, your daughter. That is the name which I have\r\n        so much difficulty in writing. I fear your wrath against\r\n        Julien, it seems so justified. I shall not be a duchess,\r\n        my father; but I knew it when I loved him; for I was\r\n        the one who loved him first, it was I who seduced him.\r\n        I have inherited from you too lofty a soul to fix my\r\n        attention on what either is or appears to be vulgar. It\r\n        is in vain that I thought of M. Croisenois with a view\r\n        to pleasing you. Why did you place real merit under my\r\n        eyes? You told me yourself on my return from Hy\xc3\xa8res,\r\n        \'that young Sorel is the one person who amuses me,\' the\r\n        poor boy is as grieved as I am if it is possible, at the\r\n        pain this letter will give you. I cannot prevent you\r\n        being irritated as a father, but love me as a friend.\r\n\r\n        "Julien respected me. If he sometimes spoke to me,\r\n        it was only by reason of his deep gratitude towards\r\n        yourself, for the natural dignity of his character\r\n        induces him to keep to his official capacity in any\r\n        answers he may make to anyone who is so much above\r\n        him. He has a keen and instinctive appreciation of the\r\n        difference of social rank. It was I (I confess it with a\r\n        blush to my best friend, and I shall never make such a\r\n        confession to anyone else) who clasped his arm one day\r\n        in the garden.\r\n\r\n        "Why need you be irritated with him, after twenty-four\r\n        hours have elapsed? My own lapse is irreparable. If you\r\n        insist on it, the assurance of his profound respect and\r\n        of his desperate grief at having displeased you, can\r\n        be conveyed to you through me. You need not see him at\r\n        all, but I shall go and join him wherever he wishes.\r\n        It is his right and it is my duty. He is the father of\r\n        my child. If your kindness will go so far as to grant\r\n        us six thousand francs to live on, I will receive it\r\n        with gratitude; if not, Julien reckons on establishing\r\n        himself at Besan\xc3\xa7on, where he will set up as a Latin and\r\n        literature master. However low may have been the station\r\n        from which he springs, I am certain he will raise\r\n        himself. With him I do not fear obscurity. If there is\r\n        a revolution, I am sure that he will play a prime part.\r\n        Can you say as much for any of those who have asked\r\n        for my hand? They have fine estates, you say. I cannot\r\n        consider that circumstance a reason for admiring them.\r\n        My Julien would attain a high position, even under the\r\n        present r\xc3\xa9gime, if he had a million and my father\'s\r\n        protection...."\r\n\r\nMathilde, who knew that the marquis was a man who always abandoned\r\nhimself to his first impulse, had written eight pages.\r\n\r\n"What am I to do?" said Julien to himself while M. de la Mole was\r\nreading this letter. "Where is (first) my duty; (second) my interest?\r\nMy debt to him is immense. Without him I should have been a menial\r\nscoundrel, and not even enough of a scoundrel to be hated and\r\npersecuted by the others. He has made me a man of the world. The\r\nvillainous acts which I now have to do are (first) less frequent;\r\n(second) less mean. That is more than as if he had given me a million.\r\nI am indebted to him for this cross and the reputation of having\r\nrendered those alleged diplomatic services, which have lifted me out of\r\nthe ruck.\r\n\r\n"If he himself were writing instructions for my conduct, what would he\r\nprescribe?"\r\n\r\nJulien was sharply interrupted by M. de la Mole\'s old valet. "The\r\nmarquis wants to see you at once, dressed or not dressed." The valet\r\nadded in a low voice, as he walked by Julien\'s side, "He is beside\r\nhimself: look out!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\nTHE HELL OF WEAKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n        A clumsy lapidary, in cutting this diamond, deprived\r\n        it of some of its most brilliant facets. In the middle\r\n        ages, nay, even under Richelieu, the Frenchman had\r\n        _force of will_.--_Mirabeau_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien found the marquis furious. For perhaps the first time in his\r\nlife this nobleman showed bad form. He loaded Julien with all the\r\ninsults that came to his lips. Our hero was astonished, and his\r\npatience was tried, but his gratitude remained unshaken.\r\n\r\n"The poor man now sees the annihilation, in a single minute, of all\r\nthe fine plans which he has long cherished in his heart. But I owe it\r\nto him to answer. My silence tends to increase his anger." The part of\r\nTartuffe supplied the answer;\r\n\r\n"I am not an angel.... I served you well; you paid me generously.... I\r\nwas grateful, but I am twenty-two.... Only you and that charming person\r\nunderstood my thoughts in this household."\r\n\r\n"Monster," exclaimed the marquis. "Charming! Charming, to be sure! The\r\nday when you found her charming you ought to have fled."\r\n\r\n"I tried to. It was then that I asked permission to leave for\r\nLanguedoc."\r\n\r\nTired of stampeding about and overcome by his grief, the marquis threw\r\nhimself into an arm-chair. Julien heard him whispering to himself, "No,\r\nno, he is not a wicked man."\r\n\r\n"No, I am not, towards you," exclaimed Julien, falling on his knees.\r\nBut he felt extremely ashamed of this manifestation, and very quickly\r\ngot up again.\r\n\r\nThe marquis was really transported. When he saw this movement, he\r\nbegan again to load him with abominable insults, which were worthy of\r\nthe driver of a fiacre. The novelty of these oaths perhaps acted as a\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\n"What! is my daughter to go by the name of madame Sorel? What! is my\r\ndaughter not to be a duchess?" Each time that these two ideas presented\r\nthemselves in all their clearness M. de la Mole was a prey to torture,\r\nand lost all power over the movements of his mind.\r\n\r\nJulien was afraid of being beaten.\r\n\r\nIn his lucid intervals, when he was beginning to get accustomed to his\r\nunhappiness, the marquis addressed to Julien reproaches which were\r\nreasonable enough. "You should have fled, sir," he said to him. "Your\r\nduty was to flee. You are the lowest of men."\r\n\r\nJulien approached the table and wrote:\r\n\r\n        "I have found my life unbearable for a long time; I am\r\n        putting an end to it. I request monsieur the marquis to\r\n        accept my apologies (together with the expression of my\r\n        infinite gratitude) for any embarrassment that may be\r\n        occasioned by my death in his h\xc3\xb4tel."\r\n\r\n"Kindly run your eye over this paper, M. the marquis," said Julien.\r\n"Kill me, or have me killed by your valet. It is one o\'clock in the\r\nmorning. I will go and walk in the garden in the direction of the wall\r\nat the bottom."\r\n\r\n"Go to the devil," cried the marquis, as he went away.\r\n\r\n"I understand," thought Julien. "He would not be sorry if I were to\r\nspare his valet the trouble of killing me....\r\n\r\n"Let him kill me, if he likes; it is a satisfaction which I offer\r\nhim.... But, by heaven, I love life. I owe it to my son."\r\n\r\nThis idea, which had not previously presented itself with so much\r\ndefiniteness to his imagination, completely engrossed him during his\r\nwalk after the first few minutes which he had spent thinking about his\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThis novel interest turned him into a prudent man. "I need advice as to\r\nhow to behave towards this infuriated man.... He is devoid of reason;\r\nhe is capable of everything. Fouqu\xc3\xa9 is too far away; besides, he would\r\nnot understand the emotions of a heart like the marquis\'s."\r\n\r\n"Count Altamira ... am I certain of eternal silence? My request\r\nfor advice must not be a fresh step which will raise still further\r\ncomplications. Alas! I have no one left but the gloomy abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. His\r\nmind is crabbed by Jansenism.... A damned Jesuit would know the world,\r\nand would be more in my line. M. Pirard is capable of beating me at the\r\nvery mention of my crime."\r\n\r\nThe genius of Tartuffe came to Julien\'s help. "Well, I will go and\r\nconfess to him." This was his final resolution after having walked\r\nabout in the garden for two good hours. He no longer thought about\r\nbeing surprised by a gun shot. He was feeling sleepy.\r\n\r\nVery early the next day, Julien was several leagues away from Paris\r\nand knocked at the door of the severe Jansenist. He found to his great\r\nastonishment that he was not unduly surprised at his confidence.\r\n\r\n"I ought perhaps to reproach myself," said the abb\xc3\xa9, who seemed more\r\nanxious than irritated. "I thought I guessed that love. My affection\r\nfor you, my unhappy boy, prevented me from warning the father."\r\n\r\n"What will he do?" said Julien keenly.\r\n\r\nAt that moment he loved the abb\xc3\xa9, and would have found a scene between\r\nthem very painful.\r\n\r\n"I see three alternatives," continued Julien.\r\n\r\n"M. de la Mole can have me put to death," and he mentioned the suicide\r\nletter which he had left with the Marquis; (2) "He can get Count\r\nNorbert to challenge me to a duel, and shoot at me point blank."\r\n\r\n"You would accept?" said the abb\xc3\xa9 furiously as he got up.\r\n\r\n"You do not let me finish. I should certainly never fire upon my\r\nbenefactor\'s son. (3) He can send me away. If he says go to Edinburgh\r\nor New York, I will obey him. They can then conceal mademoiselle de la\r\nMole\'s condition, but I will never allow them to suppress my son."\r\n\r\n"Have no doubt about it, that will be the first thought of that\r\ndepraved man."\r\n\r\nAt Paris, Mathilde was in despair. She had seen her father about seven\r\no\'clock. He had shown her Julien\'s letter. She feared that he might\r\nhave considered it noble to put an end to his life; "and without my\r\npermission?" she said to herself with a pain due solely to her anger.\r\n\r\n"If he dies I shall die," she said to her father. "It will be you\r\nwho will be the cause of his death.... Perhaps you will rejoice at\r\nit but I swear by his shades that I shall at once go into mourning,\r\nand shall publicly appear as _Madame the widow Sorel_, I shall send\r\nout my invitations, you can count on it.... You will find me neither\r\npusillanimous nor cowardly."\r\n\r\nHer love went to the point of madness. M. de la Mole was flabbergasted\r\nin his turn.\r\n\r\nHe began to regard what had happened with a certain amount of logic.\r\nMathilde did not appear at breakfast. The marquis felt an immense\r\nweight off his mind, and was particularly flattered when he noticed\r\nthat she had said nothing to her mother.\r\n\r\nJulien was dismounting from his horse. Mathilde had him called and\r\nthrew herself into his arms almost beneath the very eyes of her\r\nchambermaid. Julien was not very appreciative of this transport. He had\r\ncome away from his long consultation with the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard in a very\r\ndiplomatic and calculating mood. The calculation of possibilities had\r\nkilled his imagination. Mathilde told him, with tears in her eyes, that\r\nshe had read his suicide letter.\r\n\r\n"My father may change his mind; do me the favour of leaving for\r\nVillequier this very minute. Mount your horse again, and leave the\r\nh\xc3\xb4tel before they get up from table."\r\n\r\nWhen Julien\'s coldness and astonishment showed no sign of abatement,\r\nshe burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"Let me manage our affairs," she exclaimed ecstatically, as she clasped\r\nhim in her arms. "You know, dear, it is not of my own free will that\r\nI separate from you. Write under cover to my maid. Address it in a\r\nstrange hand-writing, I will write volumes to you. Adieu, flee."\r\n\r\nThis last word wounded Julien, but he none the less obeyed. "It will\r\nbe fatal," he thought "if, in their most gracious moments these\r\naristocrats manage to shock me."\r\n\r\nMathilde firmly opposed all her father\'s prudent plans. She would\r\nnot open negotiations on any other basis except this. She was to be\r\nMadame Sorel, and was either to live with her husband in poverty in\r\nSwitzerland, or with her father in Paris. She rejected absolutely the\r\nsuggestion of a secret accouchement. "In that case I should begin to\r\nbe confronted with a prospect of calumny and dishonour. I shall go\r\ntravelling with my husband two months after the marriage, and it will\r\nbe easy to pretend that my son was born at a proper time."\r\n\r\nThis firmness though at first received with violent fits of anger,\r\neventually made the marquis hesitate.\r\n\r\n"Here," he said to his daughter in a moment of emotion, "is a gift of\r\nten thousand francs a year. Send it to your Julien, and let him quickly\r\nmake it impossible for me to retract it."\r\n\r\nIn order to obey Mathilde, whose imperious temper he well knew, Julien\r\nhad travelled forty useless leagues; he was superintending the accounts\r\nof the farmers at Villequier. This act of benevolence on the part of\r\nthe marquis occasioned his return. He went and asked asylum of the abb\xc3\xa9\r\nPirard, who had become Mathilde\'s most useful ally during his absence.\r\nEvery time that he was questioned by the marquis, he would prove to him\r\nthat any other course except public marriage would be a crime in the\r\neyes of God.\r\n\r\n"And happily," added the abb\xc3\xa9, "worldly wisdom is in this instance in\r\nagreement with religion. Could one, in view of Mdlle. de la Mole\'s\r\npassionate character, rely for a minute on her keeping any secret which\r\nshe did not herself wish to preserve? If one does not reconcile oneself\r\nto the frankness of a public marriage, society will concern itself much\r\nlonger with this strange m\xc3\xa9salliance__. Everything must be said all\r\nat once without either the appearance or the reality of the slightest\r\nmystery."\r\n\r\n"It is true," said the marquis pensively.\r\n\r\nTwo or three friends of M. de la Mole were of the same opinion as the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. The great obstacle in their view was Mathilde\'s decided\r\ncharacter. But in spite of all these fine arguments the marquis\'s soul\r\ncould not reconcile itself to giving up all hopes of a coronet for his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nHe ransacked his memory and his imagination for all the variations of\r\nknavery and duplicity which had been feasible in his youth. Yielding to\r\nnecessity and having fear of the law seemed absurd and humiliating for\r\na man in his position. He was paying dearly now for the luxury of those\r\nenchanting dreams concerning the future of his cherished daughter in\r\nwhich he had indulged for the last ten years.\r\n\r\n"Who could have anticipated it?" he said to himself. "A girl of so\r\nproud a character, of so lofty a disposition, who is even prouder than\r\nI am of the name she bears? A girl whose hand has already been asked\r\nfor by all the cream of the nobility of France."\r\n\r\n"We must give up all faith in prudence. This age is made to confound\r\neverything. We are marching towards chaos."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\nA MAN OF INTELLECT\r\n\r\n\r\n        The prefect said to himself as he rode along the highway\r\n        on horseback, "why should I not be a minister, a\r\n        president of the council, a duke? This is how I should\r\n        make war.... By these means I should have all the\r\n        reformers put in irons."--_The Globe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo argument will succeed in destroying the paramount influence of ten\r\nyears of agreeable dreaming. The marquis thought it illogical to be\r\nangry, but could not bring himself to forgive. "If only this Julien\r\ncould die by accident," he sometimes said to himself. It was in this\r\nway that his depressed imagination found a certain relief in running\r\nafter the most absurd chim\xc3\xa6ras. They paralysed the influence of the\r\nwise arguments of the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. A month went by in this way without\r\nnegotiations advancing one single stage.\r\n\r\nThe marquis had in this family matter, just as he had in politics,\r\nbrilliant ideas over which he would be enthusiastic for two or three\r\ndays. And then a line of tactics would fail to please him because it\r\nwas based on sound arguments, while arguments only found favour in his\r\neyes in so far as they were based on his favourite plan. He would work\r\nfor three days with all the ardour and enthusiasm of a poet on bringing\r\nmatters to a certain stage; on the following day he would not give it a\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nJulien was at first disconcerted by the slowness of the marquis;\r\nbut, after some weeks, he began to surmise that M. de La Mole had no\r\ndefinite plan with regard to this matter. Madame de La Mole and the\r\nwhole household believed that Julien was travelling in the provinces\r\nin connection with the administration of the estates; he was in hiding\r\nin the parsonage of the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard and saw Mathilde every day;\r\nevery morning she would spend an hour with her father, but they would\r\nsometimes go for weeks on end without talking of the matter which\r\nengrossed all their thoughts.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to know where the man is," said the marquis to her one\r\nday. "Send him this letter." Mathilde read:\r\n\r\n"The Languedoc estates bring in 20,600 francs. I give 10,600 francs to\r\nmy daughter, and 10,000 francs to M. Julien Sorel. It is understood\r\nthat I give the actual estates. Tell the notary to draw up two separate\r\ndeeds of gift, and to bring them to me to-morrow, after this there are\r\nto be no more relations between us. Ah, Monsieur, could I have expected\r\nall this? The marquis de La Mole."\r\n\r\n"I thank you very much," said Mathilde gaily. "We will go and settle in\r\nthe Ch\xc3\xa2teau d\'Aiguillon, between Agen and Marmande. The country is said\r\nto be as beautiful as Italy."\r\n\r\nThis gift was an extreme surprise to Julien. He was no longer the cold,\r\nsevere man whom we have hitherto known. His thoughts were engrossed in\r\nadvance by his son\'s destiny. This unexpected fortune, substantial as\r\nit was for a man as poor as himself, made him ambitious. He pictured\r\na time when both his wife and himself would have an income of 36,000\r\nfrancs. As for Mathilde, all her emotions were concentrated on her\r\nadoration for her husband, for that was the name by which her pride\r\ninsisted on calling Julien. Her one great ambition was to secure the\r\nrecognition of her marriage. She passed her time in exaggerating to\r\nherself the consummate prudence which she had manifested in linking her\r\nfate to that of a superior man. The idea of personal merit became a\r\npositive craze with her.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s almost continuous absence, coupled with the complications of\r\nbusiness matters and the little time available in which to talk love,\r\ncompleted the good effect produced by the wise tactics which Julien had\r\npreviously discovered.\r\n\r\nMathilde finished by losing patience at seeing so little of the man\r\nwhom she had come really to love.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of irritation she wrote to her father and commenced her\r\nletter like Othello:\r\n\r\n"My very choice is sufficient proof that I have preferred Julien to all\r\nthe advantages which society offered to the daughter of the marquis\r\nde la Mole. Such pleasures, based as they are on prestige and petty\r\nvanity mean nothing to me. It is now nearly six weeks since I have\r\nlived separated from my husband. That is sufficient to manifest my\r\nrespect for yourself. Before next Thursday I shall leave the paternal\r\nhouse. Your acts of kindness have enriched us. No one knows my secret\r\nexcept the venerable abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard. I shall go to him: he will marry us,\r\nand an hour after the ceremony we shall be on the road to Languedoc,\r\nand we will never appear again in Paris except by your instructions.\r\nBut what cuts me to the quick is that all this will provide the subject\r\nmatter for piquant anecdotes against me and against yourself. May not\r\nthe epigrams of a foolish public compel our excellent Norbert to pick a\r\nquarrel with Julien, under such circumstances I know I should have no\r\ncontrol over him. We should discover in his soul the mark of the rebel\r\nplebian. Oh father, I entreat you on my knees, come and be present at\r\nmy marriage in M. Pirard\'s church next Thursday. It will blunt the\r\nsting of malignant scandal and will guarantee the life\'s happiness of\r\nyour only daughter, and of that of my husband, etc., etc."\r\n\r\nThis letter threw the marquis\'s soul into a strange embarrassment.\r\nHe must at last take a definite line. All his little habits: all his\r\nvulgar friends had lost their influence.\r\n\r\nIn these strange circumstances the great lines of his character,\r\nwhich had been formed by the events of his youth, reassumed all their\r\noriginal force. The misfortunes of the emigration had made him into\r\nan imaginative man. After having enjoyed for two years an immense\r\nfortune and all the distinctions of the court, 1790 had flung him into\r\nthe awful miseries of the emigration. This hard schooling had changed\r\nthe character of a spirit of twenty-two. In essence, he was not so\r\nmuch dominated by his present riches as encamped in their midst. But\r\nthat very imagination which had preserved his soul from the taint of\r\navarice, had made him a victim of a mad passion for seeing his daughter\r\ndecorated by a fine title.\r\n\r\nDuring the six weeks which had just elapsed, the marquis had felt at\r\ntimes impelled by a caprice for making Julien rich. He considered\r\npoverty mean, humiliating for himself, M. de la Mole, and impossible\r\nin his daughter\'s husband; he was ready to lavish money. On the next\r\nday his imagination would go off on another tack, and he would think\r\nthat Julien would read between the lines of this financial generosity,\r\nchange his name, exile himself to America, and write to Mathilde that\r\nhe was dead for her. M. de la Mole imagined this letter written, and\r\nwent so far as to follow its effect on his daughter\'s character.\r\n\r\nThe day when he was awakened from these highly youthful dreams by\r\nMathilde\'s actual letter after he had been thinking for along time\r\nof killing Julien or securing his disappearance he was dreaming of\r\nbuilding up a brilliant position for him. He would make him take the\r\nname of one of his estates, and why should he not make him inherit a\r\npeerage? His father-in-law, M. the duke de Chaulnes, had, since the\r\ndeath of his own son in Spain, frequently spoken to him about his\r\ndesire to transmit his title to Norbert....\r\n\r\n"One cannot help owning that Julien has a singular aptitude for\r\naffairs, had boldness, and is possibly even brilliant," said the\r\nmarquis to himself ... "but I detect at the root of his character a\r\ncertain element which alarms me. He produces the same impression upon\r\neveryone, consequently there must be something real in it," and the\r\nmore difficult this reality was to seize hold of, the more it alarmed\r\nthe imaginative mind of the old marquis.\r\n\r\n"My daughter expressed the same point very neatly the other day (in a\r\nsuppressed letter).\r\n\r\n"Julien has not joined any salon or any c\xc3\xb4terie. He has nothing to\r\nsupport himself against me, and has absolutely no resource if I abandon\r\nhim. Now is that ignorance of the actual state of society? I have said\r\nto him two or three times, the only real and profitable candidature is\r\nthe candidature of the salons.\r\n\r\n"No, he has not the adroit, cunning genius of an attorney who never\r\nloses a minute or an opportunity. He is very far from being a character\r\nlike Louis XL. On the other hand, I have seen him quote the most\r\nungenerous maxims ... it is beyond me. Can it be that he simply repeats\r\nthese maxims in order to use them as a _dam_ against his passions?\r\n\r\n"However, one thing comes to the surface; he cannot bear contempt,\r\nthat\'s my hold on him.\r\n\r\n"He has not, it is true, the religious reverence for high birth. He\r\ndoes not instinctively respect us.... That is wrong; but after all,\r\nthe only things which are supposed to make the soul of a seminary\r\nstudent impatient are lack of enjoyment and lack of money. He is quite\r\ndifferent, and cannot stand contempt at any price."\r\n\r\nPressed as he was by his daughter\'s letter, M. de la Mole realised the\r\nnecessity for making up his mind. "After all, the great question is\r\nthis:--Did Julien\'s audacity go to the point of setting out to make\r\nadvances to my daughter because he knows I love her more than anything\r\nelse in the world, and because I have an income of a hundred thousand\r\ncrowns?"\r\n\r\nMathilde protests to the contrary.... "No, monsieur Julien, that is a\r\npoint on which I am not going to be under any illusion.\r\n\r\n"Is it really a case of spontaneous and authentic love? or is it just\r\na vulgar desire to raise himself to a fine position? Mathilde is\r\nfar-seeing; she appreciated from the first that this suspicion might\r\nruin him with me--hence that confession of hers. It was she who took\r\nupon herself to love him the first.\r\n\r\n"The idea of a girl of so proud a character so far forgetting herself\r\nas to make physical advances! To think of pressing his arm in the\r\ngarden in the evening! How horrible! As though there were not a hundred\r\nother less unseemly ways of notifying him that he was the object of her\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n"_Qui s\'excuse s\'accuse_; I distrust Mathilde." The marquis\'s reasoning\r\nwas more conclusive to-day than it was usually. Nevertheless, force\r\nof habit prevailed, and he resolved to gain time by writing to his\r\ndaughter, for a correspondence was being carried on between one wing\r\nof the h\xc3\xb4tel and the other. M. de la Mole did not dare to discuss\r\nmatters with Mathilde and to see her face to face. He was frightened of\r\nclinching the whole matter by yielding suddenly.\r\n\r\n        "Mind you commit no new acts of madness; here is\r\n        a commission of lieutenant of Hussars for M. the\r\n        chevalier, Julien Sorel de la Vernaye. You see what I\r\n        am doing for him. Do not irritate me. Do not question\r\n        me. Let him leave within twenty-four hours and present\r\n        himself at Strasbourg where his regiment is. Here is an\r\n        order on my banker. Obey me."\r\n\r\nMathilde\'s love and joy were unlimited. She wished to profit by her\r\nvictory and immediately replied.\r\n\r\n        "If M. de la Vernaye knew all that you are good enough\r\n        to do for him, he would be overwhelmed with gratitude\r\n        and be at your feet. But amidst all this generosity, my\r\n        father has forgotten me; your daughter\'s honour is in\r\n        peril. An indiscretion may produce an everlasting blot\r\n        which an income of twenty thousand crowns could not\r\n        put right. I will only send the commission to M. de la\r\n        Vernaye if you give me your word that my marriage will\r\n        be publicly celebrated at Villequier in the course of\r\n        next month. Shortly after that period, which I entreat\r\n        you not to prolong, your daughter will only be able to\r\n        appear in public under the name of Madame de la Vernaye.\r\n        How I thank you, dear papa, for having saved me from the\r\n        name of Sorel, etc., etc."\r\n\r\nThe reply was unexpected:\r\n\r\n        "Obey or I retract everything. Tremble, you imprudent\r\n        young girl. I do not yet know what your Julien is,\r\n        and you yourself know less than I. Let him leave for\r\n        Strasbourg, and try to act straightly. I will notify him\r\n        from here of my wishes within a fortnight."\r\n\r\nMathilde was astonished by this firm answer. _I do not know Julien_.\r\nThese words threw her into a reverie which soon finished in the most\r\nfascinating suppositions; but she believed in their truth. My Julien\'s\r\nintellect is not clothed in the petty mean uniform of the salons, and\r\nmy father refuses to believe in his superiority by reason of the very\r\nfact which proves it.\r\n\r\nAll the same, if I do not obey this whim of his, I see the possibility\r\nof a public scene; a scandal would lower my position in society, and\r\nmight render me less fascinating in Julien\'s eyes. After the scandal\r\n... ten years of poverty; and the only thing which can prevent marrying\r\nfor merit becoming ridiculous is the most brilliant wealth. If I live\r\nfar away from my father, he is old and may forget me.... Norbert will\r\nmarry some clever, charming woman; old Louis XIV. was seduced by the\r\nduchess of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nShe decided to obey, but refrained from communicating her father\'s\r\nletter to Julien. It might perhaps have been that ferocious character\r\ndriven to some act of madness.\r\n\r\nJulien\'s joy was unlimited when she informed him in the evening that\r\nhe was a lieutenant of Hussars. Its extent can be imagined from the\r\nfact that this had constituted the ambition of his whole life, and\r\nalso from the passion which he now had for his son. The change of name\r\nstruck him with astonishment.\r\n\r\n"After all," he thought, "I have got to the end of my romance, and I\r\ndeserve all the credit. I have managed to win the love of that monster\r\nof pride," he added, looking at Mathilde. "Her father cannot live\r\nwithout her, nor she without me."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\nA STORM\r\n\r\n\r\n        My God, give me mediocrity.--_Mirabeau_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis mind was engrossed; he only half answered the eager tenderness that\r\nshe showed to him. He remained gloomy and taciturn. He had never seemed\r\nso great and so adorable in Mathilde\'s eyes. She was apprehensive of\r\nsome subtle twist of his pride which would spoil the whole situation.\r\n\r\nShe saw the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard come to the h\xc3\xb4tel nearly every morning. Might\r\nnot Julien have divined something of her father\'s intentions through\r\nhim? Might not the marquis himself have written to him in a momentary\r\ncaprice. What was the explanation of Julien\'s stern manner following on\r\nso great a happiness? She did not dare to question.\r\n\r\nShe did not _dare_--she--Mathilde! From that moment her feelings for\r\nJulien contained a certain vague and unexpected element which was\r\nalmost panic. This arid soul experienced all the passion possible in\r\nan individual who has been brought up amid that excessive civilisation\r\nwhich Paris so much admires.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following day Julien was at the house of the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard.\r\nSome post-horses were arriving in the courtyard with a dilapidated\r\nchaise which had been hired at a neighbouring station.\r\n\r\n"A vehicle like that is out of fashion," said the stern abb\xc3\xa9 to him\r\nmorosely. "Here are twenty thousand francs which M. de la Mole makes\r\nyou a gift of. He insists on your spending them within a year, but\r\nat the same time wants you to try to look as little ridiculous as\r\npossible." (The priest regarded flinging away so substantial a sum on a\r\nyoung man as simply an opportunity for sin).\r\n\r\n"The marquis adds this: \'M. Julien de la Vernaye will have received\r\nthis money from his father, whom it is needless to call by any other\r\nname. M. de la Vernaye will perhaps think it proper to give a present\r\nto M. Sorel, a carpenter of Verri\xc3\xa8res, who cared for him in his\r\nchildhood....\' I can undertake that commission," added the abb\xc3\xa9. "I\r\nhave at last prevailed upon M. de la Mole to come to a settlement with\r\nthat Jesuit, the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair. His influence is unquestionably too\r\nmuch for us. The complete recognition of your high birth on the part\r\nof this man, who is in fact the governor of B---- will be one of the\r\nunwritten terms of the arrangement." Julien could no longer control his\r\necstasy. He embraced the abb\xc3\xa9. He saw himself recognised.\r\n\r\n"For shame," said M. Pirard, pushing him away. "What is the meaning of\r\nthis worldly vanity? As for Sorel and his sons, I will offer them in my\r\nown name a yearly allowance of five hundred francs, which will be paid\r\nto each of them as long as I am satisfied with them."\r\n\r\nJulien was already cold and haughty. He expressed his thanks, but in\r\nthe vaguest terms which bound him to nothing. "Could it be possible,"\r\nhe said to himself, "that I am the natural son of some great nobleman\r\nwho was exiled to our mountains by the terrible Napoleon?" This idea\r\nseemed less and less improbable every minute.... "My hatred of my\r\nfather would be a proof of this.... In that case, I should not be an\r\nunnatural monster after all."\r\n\r\nA few days after this soliloquy the Fifteenth Regiment of Hussars,\r\nwhich was one of the most brilliant in the army, was being reviewed on\r\nthe parade ground of Strasbourg. M. the chevalier de La Vernaye sat\r\nthe finest horse in Alsace, which had cost him six thousand francs. He\r\nwas received as a lieutenant, though he had never been sub-lieutenant\r\nexcept on the rolls of a regiment of which he had never heard.\r\n\r\nHis impassive manner, his stern and almost malicious eyes, his pallor,\r\nand his invariable self-possession, founded his reputation from\r\nthe very first day. Shortly afterwards his perfect and calculated\r\npoliteness, and his skill at shooting and fencing, of which, though\r\nwithout any undue ostentation, he made his comrades aware, did away\r\nwith all idea of making fun of him openly. After hesitating for five\r\nor six days, the public opinion of the regiment declared itself in his\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n"This young man has everything," said the facetious old officers,\r\n"except youth."\r\n\r\nJulien wrote from Strasbourg to the old cur\xc3\xa9 of Verri\xc3\xa8res, M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan,\r\nwho was now verging on extreme old age.\r\n\r\n"You will have learnt, with a joy of which I have no doubt, of the\r\nevents which have induced my family to enrich me. Here are five hundred\r\nfrancs which I request you to distribute quietly, and without any\r\nmention of my name, among those unfortunate ones who are now poor as I\r\nmyself was once, and whom you will doubtless help as you once helped\r\nme."\r\n\r\nJulien was intoxicated with ambition, and not with vanity. He\r\nnevertheless devoted a great part of his time to attending to his\r\nexternal appearance. His horses, his uniform, his orderlies\' liveries,\r\nwere all kept with a correctness which would have done credit to the\r\npunctiliousness of a great English nobleman. He had scarcely been made\r\na lieutenant as a matter of favour (and that only two days ago) than\r\nhe began to calculate that if he was to become commander-in-chief\r\nat thirty, like all the great generals, then he must be more than a\r\nlieutenant at twenty-three at the latest. He thought about nothing\r\nexcept fame and his son.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of the ecstasies of the most reinless ambition that\r\nhe was surprised by the arrival of a young valet from the H\xc3\xb4tel de la\r\nMole, who had come with a letter.\r\n\r\n"All is lost," wrote Mathilde to him: "Rush here as quickly as\r\npossible, sacrifice everything, desert if necessary. As soon as you\r\nhave arrived, wait for me in a fiacre near the little garden door,\r\nnear No. ---- of the street ---- I will come and speak to you: I shall\r\nperhaps be able to introduce you into the garden. All is lost, and I am\r\nafraid there is no way out; count on me; you will find me staunch and\r\nfirm in adversity. I love you."\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards, Julien obtained a furlough from the colonel,\r\nand left Strasbourg at full gallop. But the awful anxiety which\r\ndevoured him did not allow him to continue this method of travel beyond\r\nMetz. He flung himself into a post-chaise, and arrived with an almost\r\nincredible rapidity at the indicated spot, near the little garden door\r\nof the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole. The door opened, and Mathilde, oblivious of\r\nall human conventions, rushed into his arms. Fortunately, it was only\r\nfive o\'clock in the morning, and the street was still deserted.\r\n\r\n"All is lost. My father, fearing my tears, left Thursday night. Nobody\r\nknows where for? But here is his letter: read it." She climbed into the\r\nfiacre with Julien.\r\n\r\n"I could forgive everything except the plan of seducing you because\r\nyou are rich. That, unhappy girl, is the awful truth. I give you my\r\nword of honour that I will never consent to a marriage with that man.\r\nI will guarantee him an income of 10,000 francs if he will live far\r\naway beyond the French frontiers, or better still, in America. Read the\r\nletter which I have just received in answer to the enquiries which I\r\nhave made. The impudent scoundrel had himself requested me to write to\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal. I will never read a single line you write concerning\r\nthat man. I feel a horror for both Paris and yourself. I urge you to\r\ncover what is bound to happen with the utmost secrecy. Be frank, have\r\nnothing more to do with the vile man, and you will find again the\r\nfather you have lost."\r\n\r\n"Where is Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s letter?" said Julien coldly.\r\n\r\n"Here it is. I did not want to shew it to you before you were prepared\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\n\r\n        LETTER\r\n\r\n        "My duties to the sacred cause of religion and morality,\r\n        oblige me, monsieur, to take the painful course which I\r\n        have just done with regard to yourself: an infallible\r\n        principle orders me to do harm to my neighbour at the\r\n        present moment, but only in order to avoid an even\r\n        greater scandal. My sentiment of duty must overcome\r\n        the pain which I experience. It is only too true,\r\n        monsieur, that the conduct of the person about whom you\r\n        ask me to tell you the whole truth may seem incredible\r\n        or even honest. It may possibly be considered proper\r\n        to hide or to disguise part of the truth: that would\r\n        be in accordance with both prudence and religion. But\r\n        the conduct about which you desire information has\r\n        been in fact reprehensible to the last degree, and\r\n        more than I can say. Poor and greedy as the man is, it\r\n        is only by the aid of the most consummate hypocrisy,\r\n        and by seducing a weak and unhappy woman, that he has\r\n        endeavoured to make a career for himself and become\r\n        someone in the world. It is part of my painful duty to\r\n        add that I am obliged to believe that M. Julien has no\r\n        religious principles. I am driven conscientiously to\r\n        think that one of his methods of obtaining success in\r\n        any household is to try to seduce the woman who commands\r\n        the principal influence. His one great object, in spite\r\n        of his show of disinterestedness, and his stock-in-trade\r\n        of phrases out of novels, is to succeed in doing what he\r\n        likes with the master of the household and his fortune.\r\n        He leaves behind him unhappiness and eternal remorse,\r\n        etc., etc., etc."\r\n\r\nThis extremely long letter, which was almost blotted out by tears, was\r\ncertainly in madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s handwriting; it was even written with\r\nmore than ordinary care.\r\n\r\n"I cannot blame M. de la Mole," said Julien, "after he had finished it.\r\nHe is just and prudent. What father would give his beloved daughter to\r\nsuch a man? Adieu!" Julien jumped out of the fiacre and rushed to his\r\npost-chaise, which had stopped at the end of the street. Mathilde, whom\r\nhe had apparently forgotten, took a few steps as though to follow him,\r\nbut the looks she received from the tradesmen, who were coming out on\r\nthe thresholds of their shops, and who knew who she was, forced her to\r\nreturn precipitately to the garden.\r\n\r\nJulien had left for Verri\xc3\xa8res. During that rapid journey he was unable\r\nto write to Mathilde as he had intended. His hand could only form\r\nillegible characters on the paper.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Verri\xc3\xa8res on a Sunday morning. He entered the shop of the\r\nlocal gunsmith, who overwhelmed him with congratulations on his recent\r\ngood fortune. It constituted the news of the locality.\r\n\r\nJulien had much difficulty in making him understand that he wanted a\r\npair of pistols. At his request the gunsmith loaded the pistols.\r\n\r\nThe three peals sounded; it is a well-known signal in the villages of\r\nFrance, and after the various ringings in the morning announces the\r\nimmediate commencement of Mass.\r\n\r\nJulien entered the new church of Verri\xc3\xa8res. All the lofty windows of\r\nthe building were veiled with crimson curtains. Julien found himself\r\nsome spaces behind the pew of madame de R\xc3\xaanal. It seemed to him that\r\nshe was praying fervently The sight of the woman whom he had loved so\r\nmuch made Julien\'s arm tremble so violently that he was at first unable\r\nto execute his project. "I cannot," he said to himself. "It is a\r\nphysical impossibility."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the young priest, who was officiating at the Mass, rang\r\nthe bell for the elevation of the host. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal lowered her\r\nhead, which, for a moment became entirely hidden by the folds of her\r\nshawl. Julien did not see her features so distinctly: he aimed a pistol\r\nshot at her, and missed her: he aimed a second shot, she fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\nSAD DETAILS\r\n\r\n\r\n        Do not expect any weakness on my part. I have avenged\r\n        myself. I have deserved death, and here I am. Pray for\r\n        my soul.--_Schiller_\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien remained motionless. He saw nothing more. When he recovered\r\nhimself a little he noticed all the faithful rushing from the church.\r\nThe priest had left the altar. Julien started fairly slowly to follow\r\nsome women who were going away with loud screams. A woman who was\r\ntrying to get away more quickly than the others, pushed him roughly. He\r\nfell. His feet got entangled with a chair, knocked over by the crowd;\r\nwhen he got up, he felt his neck gripped. A gendarme, in full uniform,\r\nwas arresting him. Julien tried mechanically to have recourse to his\r\nlittle pistol; but a second gendarme pinioned his arms.\r\n\r\nHe was taken to the prison. They went into a room where irons were put\r\non his hands. He was left alone. The door was doubly locked on him. All\r\nthis was done very quickly, and he scarcely appreciated it at all.\r\n\r\n"Yes, upon my word, all is over," he said aloud as he recovered\r\nhimself. "Yes, the guillotine in a fortnight ... or killing myself\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nHis reasoning did not go any further. His head felt as though it had\r\nbeen seized in some violent grip. He looked round to see if anyone was\r\nholding him. After some moments he fell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was not mortally wounded. The first bullet had pierced\r\nher hat. The second had been fired as she was turning round. The\r\nbullet had struck her on the shoulder, and, astonishing to relate,\r\nhad ricocheted from off the shoulder bone (which it had, however,\r\nbroken) against a gothic pillar, from which it had loosened an enormous\r\nsplinter of stone.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a long and painful bandaging, the solemn surgeon said to\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal, "I answer for your life as I would for my own," she\r\nwas profoundly grieved.\r\n\r\nShe had been sincerely desirous of death for a long time. The letter\r\nwhich she had written to M. de la Mole in accordance with the\r\ninjunctions of her present confessor, had proved the final blow to a\r\ncreature already weakened by an only too permanent unhappiness. This\r\nunhappiness was caused by Julien\'s absence; but she, for her own part,\r\ncalled it remorse. Her director, a young ecclesiastic, who was both\r\nvirtuous and enthusiastic, and had recently come to Dijon, made no\r\nmistake as to its nature.\r\n\r\n"Dying in this way, though not by my own hand, is very far from being\r\na sin," thought madame de R\xc3\xaanal. "God will perhaps forgive me for\r\nrejoicing over my death." She did not dare to add, "and dying by\r\nJulien\'s hand puts the last touch on my happiness."\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely been rid of the presence of the surgeon and of all the\r\ncrowd of friends that had rushed to see her, than she called her maid,\r\nElisa. "The gaoler," she said to her with a violent blush, "is a cruel\r\nman. He will doubtless ill-treat him, thinking to please me by doing\r\nso.... I cannot bear that idea. Could you not go, as though on your own\r\naccount, and give the gaoler this little packet which contains some\r\nlouis. You will tell him that religion forbids him to treat him badly,\r\nabove all, he must not go and speak about the sending of this money."\r\n\r\nIt was this circumstance, which we have just mentioned, that Julien had\r\nto thank for the humanity of the gaoler of Verri\xc3\xa8res. It was still the\r\nsame M. Noiraud, that ideal official, whom he remembered as being so\r\nfinely alarmed by M. Appert\'s presence.\r\n\r\nA judge appeared in the prison. "I occasioned death by premeditation,"\r\nsaid Julien to him. "I bought the pistols and had them loaded at\r\nso-and-so\'s, a gunsmith. Article 1342 of the penal code is clear. I\r\ndeserve death, and I expect it." Astonished at this kind of answer, the\r\njudge started to multiply his questions, with a view of the accused\r\ncontradicting himself in his answers.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see," said Julien to him with a smile, "that I am making\r\nmyself out as guilty as you can possibly desire? Go away, monsieur, you\r\nwill not fail to catch the quarry you are pursuing. You will have the\r\npleasure to condemn me. Spare me your presence."\r\n\r\n"I have an irksome duty to perform," thought Julien. "I must write to\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole:--"\r\n\r\n        "I have avenged myself," he said to her. "Unfortunately,\r\n        my name will appear in the papers, and I shall not be\r\n        able to escape from the world incognito. I shall die\r\n        in two months\' time. My revenge was ghastly, like the\r\n        pain of being separated from you. From this moment I\r\n        forbid myself to write or pronounce your name. Never\r\n        speak of me even to my son; silence is the only way of\r\n        honouring me. To the ordinary commonplace man, I shall\r\n        represent a common assassin. Allow me the luxury of the\r\n        truth at this supreme moment; you will forget me. This\r\n        great catastrophe of which I advise you not to say a\r\n        single word to a single living person, will exhaust,\r\n        for several years to come, all that romantic and unduly\r\n        adventurous element which I have detected in your\r\n        character. You were intended by nature to live among the\r\n        heroes of the middle ages; exhibit their firm character.\r\n        Let what has to happen take place in secret and without\r\n        your being compromised. You will assume a false name,\r\n        and you will confide in no one. If you absolutely need a\r\n        friend\'s help, I bequeath the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard to you.\r\n\r\n        "Do not talk to anyone else, particularly to the people\r\n        of your own class--the de Luz\'s, the Caylus\'s.\r\n\r\n        "A year after my death, marry M. de Croisenois; I\r\n        command you as your husband. Do not write to me at all,\r\n        I shall not answer. Though in my view, much less wicked\r\n        than Iago, I am going to say, like him: \'From this time\r\n        forth, I never will speack word.\'[1]\r\n\r\n        "I shall never be seen to speak or write again. You will\r\n        have received my final words and my final expressions of\r\n        adoration.\r\n\r\n                                                         "J. S."\r\n\r\nIt was only after he had despatched this letter and had recovered\r\nhimself a little, that Julien felt for the first time extremely\r\nunhappy. Those momentous words, I shall die, meant the successive\r\ntearing out of his heart of each individual hope and ambition.\r\nDeath, in itself, was not horrible in his eyes. His whole life had\r\nbeen nothing but a long preparation for unhappiness, and he had\r\nmade a point of not losing sight of what is considered the greatest\r\nunhappiness of all.\r\n\r\n"Come then," he said to himself; "if I had to fight a duel in a couple\r\nof months, with an expert duellist, should I be weak enough to think\r\nabout it incessantly with panic in my soul?"\r\n\r\nHe passed more than an hour in trying to analyze himself thoroughly on\r\nthis score.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw clear in his own soul, and the truth appeared before his\r\neyes with as much definiteness as one of the pillars of his prison, he\r\nthought about remorse.\r\n\r\n"Why should I have any? I have been atrociously injured; I have\r\nkilled--I deserve death, but that is all. I die after having squared my\r\naccount with humanity. I do not leave any obligation unfulfilled. I owe\r\nnothing to anybody; there is nothing shameful about my death, except\r\nthe instrument of it; that alone, it is true, is simply sufficient to\r\ndisgrace me in the eyes of the bourgeois of Verri\xc3\xa8res; but from the\r\nintellectual standpoint, what could be more contemptible than they? I\r\nhave one means of winning their consideration; by flinging pieces of\r\ngold to the people as I go to the scaffold. If my memory is linked with\r\nthe idea of gold, they will always look upon it as resplendent."\r\n\r\nAfter this chain of reasoning, which after a minute\'s reflection seemed\r\nto him self-evident, Julien said to himself, "I have nothing left to do\r\nin the world," and fell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 o\'clock in the evening the gaoler woke him up as he brought in\r\nhis supper.\r\n\r\n"What are they saying in Verri\xc3\xa8res?"\r\n\r\n"M. Julien, the oath which I took before the crucifix in the \'Royal\r\nCourtyard,\' on the day when I was installed in my place, obliges me to\r\nsilence."\r\n\r\nHe was silent, but remained. Julien was amused by the sight of this\r\nvulgar hypocrisy. I must make him, he thought, wait a long time for the\r\nfive francs which he wants to sell his conscience for.\r\n\r\nWhen the gaoler saw him finish his meal without making any attempt to\r\ncorrupt him, he said in a soft and perfidious voice:\r\n\r\n"The affection which I have for you, M. Julien, compels me to speak.\r\nAlthough they say that it is contrary to the interests of justice,\r\nbecause it may assist you in preparing your defence. M. Julien you are\r\na good fellow at heart, and you will be very glad to learn that madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal is better."\r\n\r\n"What! she is not dead?" exclaimed Julien, beside himself.\r\n\r\n"What, you know nothing?" said the gaoler, with a stupid air which soon\r\nturned into exultant cupidity. "It would be very proper, monsieur, for\r\nyou to give something to the surgeon, who, so far as law and justice\r\ngo, ought not to have spoken. But in order to please you, monsieur, I\r\nwent to him, and he told me everything."\r\n\r\n"Anyway, the wound is not mortal," said Julien to him impatiently, "you\r\nanswer for it on your life?"\r\n\r\nThe gaoler, who was a giant six feet tall, was frightened and retired\r\ntowards the door. Julien saw that he was adopting bad tactics for\r\ngetting at the truth. He sat down again and flung a napoleon to M.\r\nNoiraud.\r\n\r\nAs the man\'s story proved to Julien more and more conclusively that\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s wound was not mortal, he felt himself overcome by\r\ntears. "Leave me," he said brusquely.\r\n\r\nThe gaoler obeyed. Scarcely had the door shut, than Julien exclaimed:\r\n"Great God, she is not dead," and he fell on his knees, shedding hot\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nIn this supreme moment he was a believer. What mattered the hypocrisies\r\nof the priests? Could they abate one whit of the truth and sublimity of\r\nthe idea of God?\r\n\r\nIt was only then that Julien began to repent of the crime that he had\r\ncommitted. By a coincidence, which prevented him falling into despair,\r\nit was only at the present moment that the condition of physical\r\nirritation and semi-madness, in which he had been plunged since his\r\ndeparture from Paris for Verri\xc3\xa8res came to an end.\r\n\r\nHis tears had a generous source. He had no doubt about the condemnation\r\nwhich awaited him.\r\n\r\n"So she will live," he said to himself. "She will live to forgive me\r\nand love me."\r\n\r\nVery late the next morning the gaoler woke him up and said, "You must\r\nhave a famous spirit, M. Julien. I have come in twice, but I did not\r\nwant to wake you up. Here are two bottles of excellent wine which our\r\ncur\xc3\xa9, M. Maslon, has sent you."\r\n\r\n"What, is that scoundrel still here?" said Julien.\r\n\r\n"Yes, monsieur," said the gaoler, lowering his voice. "But do not talk\r\nso loud, it may do you harm."\r\n\r\nJulien laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n"At the stage I have reached, my friend, you alone can do me harm in\r\nthe event of your ceasing to be kind and tender. You will be well\r\npaid," said Julien, changing his tone and reverting to his imperious\r\nmanner. This manner was immediately justified by the gift of a piece of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nM. Noiraud related again, with the greatest detail, everything he\r\nhad learnt about madame de R\xc3\xaanal, but he did not make any mention of\r\nmademoiselle Elisa\'s visit.\r\n\r\nThe man was as base and servile as it was possible to be. An idea\r\ncrossed Julien\'s mind. "This kind of misshapen giant cannot earn more\r\nthan three or four hundred francs, for his prison is not at all full.\r\nI can guarantee him ten thousand francs, if he will escape with me\r\nto Switzerland. The difficulty will be in persuading him of my good\r\nfaith." The idea of the long conversation he would need to have with so\r\nvile a person filled Julien with disgust. He thought of something else.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the time had passed. A post-chaise had come to pick him\r\nup at midnight. He was very pleased with his travelling companions, the\r\ngendarmes. When he arrived at the prison of Besan\xc3\xa7on in the morning\r\nthey were kind enough to place him in the upper storey of a Gothic\r\nturret. He judged the architecture to be of the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century. He admired its fascinating grace and lightness.\r\nThrough a narrow space between two walls, beyond the deep court, there\r\nopened a superb vista.\r\n\r\nOn the following day there was an interrogation, after which he was\r\nleft in peace for several days. His soul was calm. He found his affair\r\na perfectly simple one. "I meant to kill. I deserve to be killed."\r\n\r\nHis thoughts did not linger any further over this line of reasoning.\r\nAs for the sentence, the disagreeableness of appearing in public,\r\nthe defence, he considered all this as slight embarrassment, irksome\r\nformalities, which it would be time enough to consider on the actual\r\nday. The actual moment of death did not seize hold of his mind either.\r\n"I will think about it after the sentence." Life was no longer boring,\r\nhe was envisaging everything from a new point of view, he had no longer\r\nany ambition. He rarely thought about mademoiselle de la Mole. His\r\npassion of remorse engrossed him a great deal, and often conjured up\r\nthe image of madame de R\xc3\xaanal, particularly during the silence of the\r\nnight, which in this high turret was only disturbed by the song of the\r\nosprey.\r\n\r\nHe thanked heaven that he had not inflicted a mortal wound.\r\n"Astonishing," he said to himself, "I thought that she had destroyed my\r\nfuture happiness for ever by her letter to M. de la Mole, and here am\r\nI, less than a fortnight after the date of that letter, not giving a\r\nsingle thought to all the things that engrossed me then. An income of\r\ntwo or three thousand francs, on which to live quietly in a mountain\r\ndistrict, like Vergy.... I was happy then.... I did not realise my\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\nAt other moments he would jump up from his chair. "If I had mortally\r\nwounded madame de R\xc3\xaanal, I would have killed myself.... I need to feel\r\ncertain of that so as not to horrify myself."\r\n\r\n"Kill myself? That\'s the great question," he said to himself. "Oh,\r\nthose judges, those fiends of red tape, who would hang their best\r\ncitizen in order to win the cross.... At any rate, I should escape from\r\ntheir control and from the bad French of their insults, which the local\r\npaper will call eloquence."\r\n\r\n"I still have five or six weeks, more or less to live.... Kill myself.\r\nNo, not for a minute," he said to himself after some days, "Napoleon\r\nwent on living."\r\n\r\n"Besides, I find life pleasant, this place is quiet, I am not troubled\r\nwith bores," he added with a smile, and he began to make out a list of\r\nthe books which he wanted to order from Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Stendhal\'s bad spelling is here reproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\nA TURRET\r\n\r\n\r\n        The tomb of a friend.--_Sterne_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe heard a loud noise in the corridor. It was not the time when the\r\ngaoler usually came up to his prison. The osprey flew away with a\r\nshriek. The door opened, and the venerable cur\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9lan threw himself\r\ninto his arms. He was trembling all over and had his stick in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Great God! Is it possible, my child--I ought to say monster?"\r\n\r\nThe good old man could not add a single word. Julien was afraid he\r\nwould fall down. He was obliged to lead him to a chair. The hand of\r\ntime lay heavy on this man who had once been so active. He seemed to\r\nJulien the mere shadow of his former self.\r\n\r\nWhen he had regained his breath, he said, "It was only the day before\r\nyesterday that I received your letter from Strasbourg with your five\r\nhundred francs for the poor of Verri\xc3\xa8res. They brought it to me in\r\nthe mountains at Liveru where I am living in retirement with my\r\nnephew Jean. Yesterday I learnt of the catastrophe.... Heavens, is it\r\npossible?" And the old man left off weeping. He did not seem to have\r\nany ideas left, but added mechanically, "You will have need of your\r\nfive hundred francs, I will bring them back to you."\r\n\r\n"I need to see you, my father," exclaimed Julien, really touched. "I\r\nhave money, anyway."\r\n\r\nBut he could not obtain any coherent answer. From time to time, M.\r\nCh\xc3\xa9lan shed some tears which coursed silently down his cheeks. He then\r\nlooked at Julien, and was quite dazed when he saw him kiss his hands\r\nand carry them to his lips. That face which had once been so vivid,\r\nand which had once portrayed with such vigour the most noble emotions\r\nwas now sunk in a perpetual apathy. A kind of peasant came soon to\r\nfetch the old man. "You must not fatigue him," he said to Julien, who\r\nunderstood that he was the nephew. This visit left Julien plunged in a\r\ncruel unhappiness which found no vent in tears. Everything seemed to\r\nhim gloomy and disconsolate. He felt his heart frozen in his bosom.\r\n\r\nThis moment was the cruellest which he had experienced since the\r\ncrime. He had just seen death and seen it in all its ugliness. All his\r\nillusions about greatness of soul and nobility of character had been\r\ndissipated like a cloud before the hurricane.\r\n\r\nThis awful plight lasted several hours. After moral poisoning, physical\r\nremedies and champagne are necessary. Julien would have considered\r\nhimself a coward to have resorted to them. "What a fool I am," he\r\nexclaimed, towards the end of the horrible day that he had spent\r\nentirely in walking up and down his narrow turret. "It\'s only, if I\r\nhad been going to die like anybody else, that the sight of that poor\r\nold man would have had any right to have thrown me into this awful fit\r\nof sadness: but a rapid death in the flower of my age simply puts me\r\nbeyond the reach of such awful senility."\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his argumentation, Julien felt as touched as any\r\nweak-minded person would have been, and consequently felt unhappy\r\nas the result of the visit. He no longer had any element of rugged\r\ngreatness, or any Roman virtue. Death appeared to him at a great height\r\nand seemed a less easy proposition.\r\n\r\n"This is what I shall take for my thermometer," he said to himself.\r\n"To-night I am ten degrees below the courage requisite for\r\nguillotine-point level. I had that courage this morning. Anyway, what\r\ndoes it matter so long as it comes back to me at the necessary moment?"\r\nThis thermometer idea amused him and finally managed to distract him.\r\n\r\nWhen he woke up the next day he was ashamed of the previous day. "My\r\nhappiness and peace of mind are at stake." He almost made up his mind\r\nto write to the Procureur-General to request that no one should be\r\nadmitted to see him. "And how about Fouqu\xc3\xa9," he thought? "If he takes\r\nit upon himself to come to Besan\xc3\xa7on, his grief will be immense."\r\nIt had perhaps been two months since he had given Fouqu\xc3\xa9 a thought.\r\n"I was a great fool at Strasbourg. My thoughts did not go beyond my\r\ncoat-collar. He was much engrossed by the memory of Fouqu\xc3\xa9, which\r\nleft him more and more touched. He walked nervously about. Here I\r\nam, clearly twenty degrees below death point.... If this weakness\r\nincreases, it will be better for me to kill myself. What joy for the\r\nabb\xc3\xa9 Maslon, and the Valenods, if I die like an usher."\r\n\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 arrived. The good, simple man, was distracted by grief. His one\r\nidea, so far as he had any at all, was to sell all he possessed in\r\norder to bribe the gaoler and secure Julien\'s escape. He talked to him\r\nat length of M. de Lavalette\'s escape.\r\n\r\n"You pain me," Julien said to him. "M. de Lavalette was innocent--I\r\nam guilty. Though you did not mean to, you made me think of the\r\ndifference...."\r\n\r\n"But is it true? What? were you going to sell all you possessed?" said\r\nJulien, suddenly becoming mistrustful and observant.\r\n\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 was delighted at seeing his friend answer his obsessing idea,\r\nand detailed at length, and within a hundred francs, what he would get\r\nfor each of his properties.\r\n\r\n"What a sublime effort for a small country land-owner," thought Julien.\r\n"He is ready to sacrifice for me the fruits of all the economies, and\r\nall the little semi-swindling tricks which I used to be ashamed of when\r\nI saw him practice them."\r\n\r\n"None of the handsome young people whom I saw in the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole,\r\nand who read Ren\xc3\xa9, would have any of his ridiculous weaknesses: but,\r\nexcept those who are very young and who have also inherited riches\r\nand are ignorant of the value of money, which of all those handsome\r\nParisians would be capable of such a sacrifice?"\r\n\r\nAll Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s mistakes in French and all his common gestures seemed to\r\ndisappear. He threw himself into his arms. Never have the provinces\r\nin comparison with Paris received so fine a tribute. Fouqu\xc3\xa9 was so\r\ndelighted with the momentary enthusiasm which he read in his friend\'s\r\neyes that he took it for consent to the flight.\r\n\r\nThis view of the sublime recalled to Julien all the strength that the\r\napparition of M. Ch\xc3\xa9lan had made him lose. He was still very young;\r\nbut in my view he was a fine specimen. Instead of his character passing\r\nfrom tenderness to cunning, as is the case with the majority of men,\r\nage would have given him that kindness of heart which is easily melted\r\n... but what avail these vain prophecies.\r\n\r\nThe interrogations became more frequent in spite of all the efforts\r\nof Julien, who always endeavoured by his answers to shorten the whole\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n"I killed, or at any rate, I wished to occasion death, and I did so\r\nwith premeditation," he would repeat every day. But the judge was\r\na pedant above everything. Julien\'s confessions had no effect in\r\ncurtailing the interrogations. The judge\'s conceit was wounded. Julien\r\ndid not know that they had wanted to transfer him into an awful cell,\r\nand that it was only, thanks to Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s efforts, that he was allowed\r\nto keep his pretty room at the top of a hundred and eighty steps.\r\n\r\nM. the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair was one of the important customers who entrusted\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 with the purveying of their firewood. The good tradesmen managed\r\nto reach the all powerful grand vicar. M. de Frilair informed him,\r\nto his unspeakable delight, that he was so touched by Julien\'s good\r\nqualities, and by the services which he had formerly rendered to the\r\nseminary, that he intended to recommend him to the judges. Fouqu\xc3\xa9\r\nthought he saw a hope of saving his friend, and as he went out, bowing\r\ndown to the ground, requested M. the grand vicar, to distribute a sum\r\nof ten louis in masses to entreat the acquittal of the accused.\r\n\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 was making a strange mistake. M. de Frilair was very far from\r\nbeing a Valenod. He refused, and even tried to make the good peasant\r\nunderstand that he would do better to keep his money. Seeing that it\r\nwas impossible to be clear without being indiscreet, he advised him to\r\ngive that sum as alms for the use of the poor prisoners, who, in point\r\nof fact, were destitute of everything.\r\n\r\n"This Julien is a singular person, his action is unintelligible,"\r\nthought M. de Frilair, "and I ought to find nothing unintelligible.\r\nPerhaps it will be possible to make a martyr of him.... In any case,\r\nI shall get to the bottom of the matter, and shall perhaps find an\r\nopportunity of putting fear into the heart of that madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nwho has no respect for us, and at the bottom detests me.... Perhaps\r\nI might be able to utilise all this as a means of a brilliant\r\nreconciliation with M. de la Mole, who has a weakness for the little\r\nseminarist."\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the lawsuit had been signed some weeks previously,\r\nand the abb\xc3\xa9 Pirard had left Besan\xc3\xa7on after having duly mentioned\r\nJulien\'s mysterious birth, on the very day when the unhappy man tried\r\nto assassinate madame de R\xc3\xaanal in the church of Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\nThere was only one disagreeable event between himself and his death\r\nwhich Julien anticipated. He consulted Fouqu\xc3\xa9 concerning his idea\r\nof writing to M. the Procureur-General asking to be exempt from all\r\nvisits. This horror at the sight of a father, above all at a moment\r\nlike this, deeply shocked the honest middle-class heart of the wood\r\nmerchant.\r\n\r\nHe thought he understood why so many people had a passionate hatred for\r\nhis friend. He concealed his feelings out of respect for misfortune.\r\n\r\n"In any case," he answered coldly, "such an order for privacy would not\r\nbe applied to your father."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII\r\n\r\nA POWERFUL MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n        But her proceedings are so mysterious and her figure is\r\n        so elegant! Who can she be?--_Schiller_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doors of the turret opened very early on the following day.\r\n\r\n"Oh! good God," he thought, "here\'s my father! What an unpleasant\r\nscene!"\r\n\r\nAt the same time a woman dressed like a peasant rushed into his arms.\r\nHe had difficulty in recognising her. It was mademoiselle de la Mole.\r\n\r\n"You wicked man! Your letter only told me where you were. As for what\r\nyou call your crime, but which is really nothing more or less than a\r\nnoble vengeance, which shews me all the loftiness of the heart which\r\nbeats within your bosom, I only got to know of it at Verri\xc3\xa8res."\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his prejudices against mademoiselle de la Mole,\r\nprejudices moreover which he had not owned to himself quite frankly,\r\nJulien found her extremely pretty. It was impossible not to recognise\r\nboth in what she had done and what she had said, a noble disinterested\r\nfeeling far above the level of anything that a petty vulgar soul would\r\nhave dared to do? He thought that he still loved a queen, and after a\r\nfew moments said to her with a remarkable nobility both of thought and\r\nof elocution,\r\n\r\n"I sketched out the future very clearly. After my death I intended to\r\nremarry you to M. de Croisenois, who will officially of course then\r\nmarry a widow. The noble but slightly romantic soul of this charming\r\nwidow, who will have been brought back to the cult of vulgar prudence\r\nby an astonishing and singular event which played in her life a part\r\nas great as it was tragic, will deign to appreciate the very real\r\nmerit of the young marquis. You will resign yourself to be happy with\r\nordinary worldly happiness, prestige, riches, high rank. But, dear\r\nMathilde, if your arrival at Besan\xc3\xa7on is suspected, it will be a mortal\r\nblow for M. de la Mole, and that is what I shall never forgive myself.\r\nI have already caused him so much sorrow. The academician will say that\r\nhe has nursed a serpent in his bosom.\r\n\r\n"I must confess that I little expected so much cold reason and so much\r\nsolicitude for the future," said mademoiselle de la Mole, slightly\r\nannoyed. "My maid who is almost as prudent as you are, took a passport\r\nfor herself, and I posted here under the name of madam Michelet."\r\n\r\n"And did madame Michelet find it so easy to get to see me?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! you are still the same superior man whom I chose to favour. I\r\nstarted by offering a hundred francs to one of the judge\'s secretaries,\r\nwho alleged at first that my admission into this turret was impossible.\r\nBut once he had got the money the worthy man kept me waiting, raised\r\nobjections, and I thought that he meant to rob me--" She stopped.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Julien.\r\n\r\n"Do not be angry, my little Julien," she said, kissing him. "I was\r\nobliged to tell my name to the secretary, who took me for a young\r\nworking girl from Paris in love with handsome Julien. As a matter of\r\nfact those are his actual expressions. I swore to him, my dear, that I\r\nwas your wife, and I shall have a permit to see you every day."\r\n\r\n"Nothing could be madder," thought Julien, "but I could not help it.\r\nAfter all, M. de la Mole is so great a nobleman that public opinion\r\nwill manage to find an excuse for the young colonel who will marry\r\nsuch a charming widow. My death will atone for everything;" and he\r\nabandoned himself with delight to Mathilde\'s love. It was madness, it\r\nwas greatness of soul, it was the most remarkable thing possible. She\r\nseriously suggested that she should kill herself with him.\r\n\r\nAfter these first transports, when she had had her fill of the\r\nhappiness of seeing Julien, a keen curiosity suddenly invaded her soul.\r\nShe began to scrutinize her lover, and found him considerably above\r\nthe plane which she had anticipated. Boniface de La Mole seemed to be\r\nbrought to life again, but on a more heroic scale.\r\n\r\nMathilde saw the first advocates of the locality, and offended them by\r\noffering gold too crudely, but they finished by accepting.\r\n\r\nShe promptly came to the conclusion that so far as dubious and far\r\nreaching intrigues were concerned, everything depended at Besan\xc3\xa7on on\r\nM. the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair.\r\n\r\nShe found at first overwhelming difficulties in obtaining an interview\r\nwith the all-powerful leader of the congregation under the obscure name\r\nof madame Michelet. But the rumour of the beauty of a young dressmaker,\r\nwho was madly in love, and had come from Paris to Besan\xc3\xa7on to console\r\nthe young abb\xc3\xa9 Julien Sorel, spread over the town.\r\n\r\nMathilde walked about the Besan\xc3\xa7on streets alone: she hoped not to be\r\nrecognised. In any case, she thought it would be of some use to her\r\ncause if she produced a great impression on the people. She thought, in\r\nher madness, of making them rebel in order to save Julien as he walked\r\nto his death. Mademoiselle de la Mole thought she was dressed simply\r\nand in a way suitable to a woman in mourning, she was dressed in fact\r\nin such a way as to attract every one\'s attention.\r\n\r\nShe was the object of everyone\'s notice at Besan\xc3\xa7on when she obtained\r\nan audience of M. de Frilair after a week spent in soliciting it.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all her courage, the idea of an influential leader of the\r\ncongregation, and the idea of deep and calculating criminality, were so\r\nassociated with each other in her mind, that she trembled as she rang\r\nthe bell at the door of the bishop\'s palace. She could scarcely walk\r\nwhen she had to go up the staircase, which led to the apartment of the\r\nfirst grand Vicar. The solitude of the episcopal palace chilled her. "I\r\nmight sit down in an armchair, and the armchair might grip my arms: I\r\nshould then disappear. Whom could my maid ask for? The captain of the\r\ngendarmerie will take care to do nothing. I am isolated in this great\r\ntown."\r\n\r\nAfter her first look at the apartment, mademoiselle de la Mole felt\r\nreassured. In the first place, the lackey who had opened the door to\r\nher had on a very elegant livery. The salon in which she was asked to\r\nwait displayed that refined and delicate luxury which differs so much\r\nfrom crude magnificence, and which is only found in the best houses in\r\nParis. As soon as she noticed M. de Frilair coming towards her with\r\nquite a paternal air, all her ideas of his criminality disappeared. She\r\ndid not even find on his handsome face the impress of that drastic and\r\nsomewhat savage courage which is so anti-pathetic to Paris society.\r\nThe half-smile which animated the features of the priest, who was\r\nall-powerful at Besan\xc3\xa7on, betokened the well-bred man, the learned\r\nprelate, the clever administrator. Mathilde felt herself at Paris.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of a few minutes for M. de Frilair to induce Mathilde\r\nto confess to him that she was the daughter of his powerful opponent,\r\nthe marquis de la Mole.\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact, I am not Madame Michelet," she said, reassuming\r\nall the haughtiness of her natural demeanour, "and this confession\r\ncosts me but little since I have come to consult you, monsieur, on the\r\npossibility of procuring the escape of M. de la Vernaye. Moreover, he\r\nis only guilty of a piece of folly; the woman whom he shot at is well;\r\nand, in the second place, I can put down fifty-thousand francs straight\r\naway for the purpose of bribing the officials, and pledge myself for\r\ntwice that sum. Finally, my gratitude and the gratitude of my family\r\nwill be ready to do absolutely anything for the man who has saved M. de\r\nla Vernaye."\r\n\r\nM. de Frilair seemed astonished at the name. Mathilde shewed him\r\nseveral letters from the Minister of War, addressed to M. Julien Sorel\r\nde la Vernaye.\r\n\r\n"You see, monsieur, that my father took upon himself the responsibility\r\nof his career. I married him secretly, my father was desirous that he\r\nshould be a superior officer before the notification of this marriage,\r\nwhich, after all, is somewhat singular for a de la Mole."\r\n\r\nMathilde noticed that M. de Frilair\'s expression of goodwill and mild\r\ncheerfulness was rapidly vanishing in proportion as he made certain\r\nimportant discoveries. His face exhibited a subtlety tinged with deep\r\nperfidiousness, the abb\xc3\xa9 had doubts, he was slowly re-reading the\r\nofficial documents.\r\n\r\n"What can I get out of these strange confidences?" he said to himself.\r\n"Here I am suddenly thrown into intimate relations with a friend of\r\nthe celebrated mar\xc3\xa9chale de Fervaques, who is the all-powerful niece\r\nof my lord, bishop of ---- who can make one a bishop of France. What\r\nI looked upon as an extremely distant possibility presents itself\r\nunexpectedly. This may lead me to the goal of all my hopes."\r\n\r\nMathilde was at first alarmed by the sudden change in the expression\r\nof this powerful man, with whom she was alone in a secluded room. "But\r\ncome," she said to herself soon afterwards. "Would it not have been\r\nmore unfortunate if I had made no impression at all on the cold egoism\r\nof a priest who was already sated with power and enjoyment?"\r\n\r\nDazzled at the sight of this rapid and unexpected path of reaching the\r\nepiscopate which now disclosed itself to him, and astonished as he was\r\nby Mathilde\'s genius, M. de Frilair ceased for a moment to be on his\r\nguard. Mademoiselle de la Mole saw him almost at her feet, tingling\r\nwith ambition, and trembling nervously.\r\n\r\n"Everything is cleared up," she thought. "Madame de Fervaques\' friend\r\nwill find nothing impossible in this town." In spite of a sentiment\r\nof still painful jealousy she had sufficient courage to explain that\r\nJulien was the intimate friend of the mar\xc3\xa9chale, and met my lord the\r\nbishop of ---- nearly every day.\r\n\r\n"If you were to draw by ballot four or five times in succession a\r\nlist of thirty-six jurymen from out the principal inhabitants of this\r\ndepartment," said the grand Vicar, emphasizing his words, and with a\r\nhard, ambitious expression in his eyes, "I should not feel inclined to\r\ncongratulate myself, if I could not reckon on eight or ten friends who\r\nwould be the most intelligent of the lot in each list. I can always\r\nmanage in nearly every case to get more than a sufficient majority to\r\nsecure a condemnation, so you see, mademoiselle, how easy it is for me\r\nto secure a conviction." The abb\xc3\xa9 stopped short as though astonished\r\nby the sound of his own words; he was admitting things which are never\r\nsaid to the profane. But he in his turn dumbfounded Mathilde when he\r\ninformed her that the special feature in Julien\'s strange adventure\r\nwhich astonished and interested Besan\xc3\xa7on society, was that he had\r\nformerly inspired Madame de R\xc3\xaanal with a grand passion and reciprocated\r\nit for a long time. M. de Frilair had no difficulty in perceiving the\r\nextreme trouble which his story produced.\r\n\r\n"I have my revenge," he thought. "After all it\'s a way of managing\r\nthis decided young person. I was afraid that I should not succeed." Her\r\ndistinguished and intractable appearance intensified in his eyes the\r\ncharm of the rare beauty whom he now saw practically entreating him. He\r\nregained all his self-possession--and he did not hesitate to move the\r\ndagger about in her heart.\r\n\r\n"I should not be at all surprised," he said to her lightly, "if we\r\nwere to learn that it was owing to jealousy that M. Sorel fired two\r\npistol shots at the woman he once loved so much. Of course she must\r\nhave consoled herself and for some time she has been seeing extremely\r\nfrequently a certain abb\xc3\xa9 Marquinot of Dijon, a kind of Jansenist, and\r\nas immoral as all Jansenists are."\r\n\r\nM. de Frilair experienced the voluptuous pleasure of torturing at\r\nhis leisure the heart of this beautiful girl whose weakness he had\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n"Why," he added, as he fixed his ardent eyes upon Mathilde, "should\r\nM. Sorel have chosen the church, if it were not for the reason that\r\nhis rival was celebrating mass in it at that very moment? Everyone\r\nattributes an infinite amount of intelligence and an even greater\r\namount of prudence to the fortunate man who is the object of your\r\ninterest. What would have been simpler than to hide himself in the\r\ngarden of M. de R\xc3\xaanal which he knows so well. Once there he could put\r\nthe woman of whom he was jealous to death with the practical certainty\r\nof being neither seen, caught, nor suspected."\r\n\r\nThis apparently sound train of reasoning eventually made Mathilde\r\nloose all self-possession. Her haughty soul steeped in all that arid\r\nprudence, which passes in high society for the true psychology of the\r\nhuman heart, was not of the type to be at all quick in appreciating\r\nthat joy of scorning all prudence, which an ardent soul can find so\r\nkeen. In the high classes of Paris society in which Mathilde had lived,\r\nit is only rarely that passion can divest itself of prudence, and\r\npeople always make a point of throwing themselves out of windows from\r\nthe fifth storey.\r\n\r\nAt last the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair was sure of his power over her. He gave\r\nMathilde to understand (and he was doubtless lying) that he could do\r\nwhat he liked with the public official who was entrusted with the\r\nconduct of Julien\'s prosecution. After the thirty-six jurymen for the\r\nsessions had been chosen by ballot, he would approach at least thirty\r\njurymen directly and personally.\r\n\r\nIf M. de Frilair had not thought Mathilde so pretty, he would not have\r\nspoken so clearly before the fifth or sixth interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX\r\n\r\nTHE INTRIGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n        Castres 1676--A brother has just murdered his sister\r\n        in the house next to mine. This gentleman had already\r\n        been guilty of one murder. His father saved his life by\r\n        causing five-hundred crowns to be distributed among the\r\n        councillors.--_Locke: Journey in France_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she left the bishop\'s palace, Mathilde did not hesitate to\r\ndespatch a courier to madame de Fervaques. The fear of compromising\r\nherself did not stop her for a moment. She entreated her rival to\r\nobtain for M. de Frilair an autograph letter from the bishop of ----.\r\nShe went as far as to entreat her to come herself to Besan\xc3\xa7on with all\r\nspeed. This was an heroic act on the part of a proud and jealous soul.\r\n\r\nActing on Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s advice, she had had the discretion to refrain from\r\nmentioning the steps she had taken for Julien. Her presence troubled\r\nhim enough without that. A better man when face to face with death than\r\nhe had ever been during his life, he had remorse not only towards M. de\r\nla Mole, but also towards Mathilde.\r\n\r\n"Come," he said to himself, "there are times when I feel absent-minded\r\nand even bored by her society. She is ruining herself on my account,\r\nand this is how I reward her. Am I really a scoundrel?" This question\r\nwould have bothered him but little in the days when he was ambitious.\r\nIn those days he looked upon failure as the only disgrace.\r\n\r\nHis moral discomfort when with Mathilde was proportionately emphasized\r\nby the fact that he inspired her at this time with the maddest and most\r\nextraordinary passion. She talked of nothing but the strange sacrifices\r\nthat she was ready to make in order to save him.\r\n\r\nExalted as she was by a sentiment on which she plumed herself, to the\r\ncomplete subordination of her pride, she would have liked not to have\r\nlet a single minute of her life go by without filling it with some\r\nextraordinary act. The strangest projects, and ones involving her in\r\nthe utmost danger, supplied the topics of her long interviews with\r\nJulien. The well-paid gaolers allowed her to reign over the prison.\r\nMathilde\'s ideas were not limited by the sacrifice of her reputation.\r\nShe would have thought nothing of making her condition known to society\r\nat large. Throwing herself on her knees before the king\'s carriage\r\nas it galloped along, in order to ask for Julien\'s pardon, and thus\r\nattracting the attention of the prince, at the risk of being crushed\r\na thousand times over, was one of the least fantastic dreams in which\r\nthis exalted and courageous imagination chose to indulge. She was\r\ncertain of being admitted into the reserved portion of the park of St.\r\nCloud, through those friends of hers who were employed at the king\'s\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nJulien thought himself somewhat unworthy of so much devotion. As a\r\nmatter of fact, he was tired of heroism. A simple, na\xc3\xafve, and almost\r\ntimid tenderness was what would have appealed to him, while Mathilde\'s\r\nhaughty soul, on the other hand, always required the idea of a public\r\nand an audience.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all her anguish and all her fears for the life of\r\nthat lover whom she was unwilling to survive, she felt a secret need\r\nof astonishing the public by the extravagance of her love and the\r\nsublimity of her actions.\r\n\r\nJulien felt irritated at not finding himself touched by all this\r\nheroism. What would he have felt if he had known of all the mad ideas\r\nwith which Mathilde overwhelmed the devoted but eminently logical and\r\nlimited spirit of the good Fouqu\xc3\xa9?\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to find fault with in Mathilde\'s devotion. For\r\nhe, too, would have sacrificed all his fortune, and have exposed his\r\nlife to the greatest risks in order to save Julien. He was dumbfounded\r\nby the quantity of gold which Mathilde flung away. During the first\r\ndays Fouqu\xc3\xa9, who had all the provincial\'s respect for money, was much\r\nimpressed by the sums she spent in this way.\r\n\r\nHe at last discovered that mademoiselle de la Mole\'s projects\r\nfrequently varied, and he was greatly relieved at finding a word with\r\nwhich to express his blame for a character whom he found so exhausting.\r\nShe was changeable. There is only a step from this epithet to that of\r\nwrong-headed, the greatest term of opprobrium known to the provinces.\r\n\r\n"It is singular," said Julien to himself, as Mathilde was going out\r\nof his prison one day, "that I should be so insensible at being the\r\nobject of so keen a passion! And two months ago I adored her! I have,\r\nof course, read that the approach of death makes one lose interest\r\nin everything, but it is awful to feel oneself ungrateful, and not\r\nto be able to change. Am I an egoist, then?" He addressed the most\r\nhumiliating reproaches to himself on this score.\r\n\r\nAmbition was dead in his heart; another passion had arisen from its\r\nashes. He called it remorse at having assassinated madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, he loved her to the point of distraction. He\r\nexperienced a singular happiness on these occasions when, being left\r\nabsolutely alone, and without being afraid of being interrupted, he\r\ncould surrender himself completely to the memory of the happy days\r\nwhich he had once passed at Verri\xc3\xa8res, or at Vergy. The slightest\r\nincidents of these days, which had fleeted away only too rapidly,\r\npossessed an irresistible freshness and charm. He never gave a thought\r\nto his Paris successes; they bored him.\r\n\r\nThese moods, which became intensified with every succeeding day, were\r\npartly guessed by the jealous Mathilde. She realised very clearly that\r\nshe had to struggle against his love of solitude. Sometimes, with\r\nterror in her heart, she uttered madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s name.\r\n\r\nShe saw Julien quiver. Henceforth her passion had neither bounds nor\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n"If he dies, I will die after him," she said to herself in all good\r\nfaith. "What will the Paris salons say when they see a girl of my own\r\nrank carry her adoration for a lover who is condemned to death to such\r\na pitch as this? For sentiments like these you must go back to the age\r\nof the heroes. It was loves of this kind which thrilled the hearts of\r\nthe century of Charles IX. and Henri III."\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her keenest transports, when she was clasping Julien\'s\r\nhead against her heart, she would say to herself with horror, "What!\r\nis this charming head doomed to fall? Well," she added, inflamed by\r\na not unhappy heroism, "these lips of mine, which are now pressing\r\nagainst this pretty hair, will be icy cold less than twenty-four hours\r\nafterwards."\r\n\r\nThoughts of the awful voluptuousness of such heroic moments gripped\r\nher in a compelling embrace. The idea of suicide, absorbing enough\r\nin itself, entered that haughty soul (to which, up to the present it\r\nhad been so utterly alien), and soon reigned over it with an absolute\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\n"No, the blood of my ancestors has not grown tepid in descending to\r\nme," said Mathilde proudly to herself.\r\n\r\n"I have a favour to ask of you," said her lover to her one day. "Put\r\nyour child out to nurse at Verri\xc3\xa8res. Madame de R\xc3\xaanal will look after\r\nthe nurse."\r\n\r\n"Those words of yours are very harsh." And Mathilde paled.\r\n\r\n"It is true, and I ask your pardon a thousand times," exclaimed Julien,\r\nemerging from his reverie, and clasping her in his arms.\r\n\r\nAfter having dried his tears, he reverted to his original idea, but\r\nwith greater tact. He had given a twist of melancholy philosophy to the\r\nconversation. He talked of that future of his which was so soon going\r\nto close. "One must admit, dear one, that passions are an accident in\r\nlife, but such accidents only occur in superior souls.... My son\'s\r\ndeath would be in reality a happiness for your own proud family, and\r\nall the servants will realize as much. Neglect will be the lot of that\r\nchild of shame and unhappiness. I hope that, at a time which I do not\r\nwish to fix, but which nevertheless I am courageous enough to imagine,\r\nyou will obey my last advice: you will marry the marquis de Croisenois."\r\n\r\n"What? Dishonoured?"\r\n\r\n"Dishonour cannot attach to a name such as yours. You will be a widow,\r\nand the widow of a madman--that is all. I will go further--my crime\r\nwill confer no dishonour, since it had no money motive. Perhaps when\r\nthe time comes for your marriage, some philosophic legislator will have\r\nso far prevailed on the prejudice of his contemporaries as to have\r\nsecured the suppression of the death penalty. Then some friendly voice\r\nwill say, by way of giving an instance: \'Why, madame de la Mole\'s first\r\nhusband was a madman, but not a wicked man or a criminal. It was absurd\r\nto have his head cut off.\' So my memory will not be infamous in any\r\nway--at least, after a certain time.... Your position in society, your\r\nfortune, and, if you will allow me to say so, your genius, will make M.\r\nde Croisenois, once he is your husband, play a part which he would have\r\nnever managed to secure unaided. He only possesses birth and bravery,\r\nand those qualities alone, though they constituted an accomplished man\r\nin 1729, are an anachronism a century later on, and only give rise to\r\nunwarranted pretensions. You need other things if you are to place\r\nyourself at the head of the youth of France."\r\n\r\n"You will take all the help of your firm and enterprising character\r\nto the political party which you will make your husband join. You may\r\nbe able to be a successor to the Chevreuses and the Longuevilles of\r\nthe Fronde--but then, dear one, the divine fire which animates you\r\nat present will have grown a little tepid. Allow me to tell you," he\r\nadded, "after many other preparatory phrases, that in fifteen years\'\r\ntime you will look upon the love you once had for me as a madness,\r\nwhich though excusable, was a piece of madness all the same."\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly and became meditative. He found himself again\r\nconfronted with the idea which shocked Mathilde so much: "In fifteen\r\nyears, madame de R\xc3\xaanal will adore my son and you will have forgotten\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX\r\n\r\nTRANQUILITY\r\n\r\n\r\n        It is because I was foolish then that I am wise to-day.\r\n        Oh thou philosopher who seest nothing except the actual\r\n        instant. How short-sighted are thy views! Thine eye\r\n        is not adapted to follow the subterranean work of the\r\n        passions.--_M. Goethe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis conversation was interrupted by an interrogation followed by\r\na conference with the advocate entrusted with the defence. These\r\nmoments were the only absolutely unpleasant ones in a life made up of\r\nnonchalance and tender reveries.\r\n\r\n"There is murder, and murder with premeditation," said Julien to the\r\njudge as he had done to the advocate, "I am sorry, gentlemen, he added\r\nwith a smile, that this reduces your functions to a very small compass."\r\n\r\n"After all," said Julien to himself, when he had managed to rid\r\nhimself of those two persons, "I must really be brave, and apparently\r\nbraver than those two men. They regard that duel with an unfortunate\r\ntermination, which I can only seriously bother myself about on the\r\nactual day, as the greatest of evils and the arch-terror."\r\n\r\n"The fact is that I have known a much greater unhappiness," continued\r\nJulien, as he went on philosophising with himself. "I suffered far\r\nmore acutely during my first journey to Strasbourg, when I thought I\r\nwas abandoned by Mathilde--and to think that I desired so passionately\r\nthat same perfect intimacy which to-day leaves me so cold--as a matter\r\nof fact I am more happy alone than when that handsome girl shares my\r\nsolitude."\r\n\r\nThe advocate, who was a red-tape pedant, thought him mad, and believed,\r\nwith the public, that it was jealousy which had lead him to take up\r\nthe pistol. He ventured one day to give Julien to understand that\r\nthis contention, whether true or false, would be an excellent way of\r\npleading. But the accused man became in a single minute a passionate\r\nand drastic individual.\r\n\r\n"As you value your life, monsieur," exclaimed Julien, quite beside\r\nhimself, "mind you never put forward such an abominable lie." The\r\ncautious advocate was for a moment afraid of being assassinated.\r\n\r\nHe was preparing his case because the decisive moment was drawing near.\r\nThe only topic of conversation in Besan\xc3\xa7on, and all the department, was\r\nthe _cause c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre_. Julien did not know of this circumstance. He had\r\nrequested his friends never to talk to him about that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nOn this particular day, Fouqu\xc3\xa9 and Mathilde had tried to inform him\r\nof certain rumours which in their view were calculated to give hope.\r\nJulien had stopped them at the very first word.\r\n\r\n"Leave me my ideal life. Your pettifogging troubles and details of\r\npractical life all more or less jar on me and bring me down from my\r\nheaven. One dies as best one can: but I wish to chose my own way of\r\nthinking about death. What do I care for other people? My relations\r\nwith other people will be sharply cut short. Be kind enough not to talk\r\nto me any more about those people. Seeing the judge and the advocate is\r\nmore than enough."\r\n\r\n"As a matter of fact," he said to himself, "it seems that I am fated\r\nto die dreaming. An obscure creature like myself, who is certain to be\r\nforgotten within a fortnight, would be very silly, one must admit, to\r\ngo and play a part. It is nevertheless singular that I never knew so\r\nmuch about the art of enjoying life, as since I have seen its end so\r\nnear me."\r\n\r\nHe passed his last day in promenading upon the narrow terrace at the\r\ntop of the turret, smoking some excellent cigars which Mathilde had\r\nhad fetched from Holland by a courier. He had no suspicion that his\r\nappearance was waited for each day by all the telescopes in the town.\r\nHis thoughts were at Vergy. He never spoke to Fouqu\xc3\xa9 about madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal, but his friend told him two or three times that she was rapidly\r\nrecovering, and these words reverberated in his heart.\r\n\r\nWhile Julien\'s soul was nearly all the time wholly in the realm\r\nof ideas, Mathilde, who, as befits an aristocratic spirit, had\r\noccupied herself with concrete things, had managed to make the\r\ndirect and intimate correspondence between madame de Fervaques and\r\nM. de Frilair progress so far that the great word bishopric had been\r\nalready pronounced. The venerable prelate, who was entrusted with the\r\ndistribution of the benefices, added in a postscript to one of his\r\nniece\'s letters, "This poor Sorel is only a lunatic. I hope he will be\r\nrestored to us."\r\n\r\nAt the sight of these lines, M. de Frilair felt transported. He had no\r\ndoubts about saving Julien.\r\n\r\n"But for this Jacobin law which has ordered the formation of an\r\nunending panel of jurymen, and which has no other real object, except\r\nto deprive well-born people of all their influence," he said to\r\nMathilde on the eve of the balloting for the thirty-six jurymen of the\r\nsession, "I would have answered for the verdict. I certainly managed to\r\nget the cur\xc3\xa9 N---- acquitted."\r\n\r\nWhen the names were selected by ballot on the following day, M. de\r\nFrilair experienced a genuine pleasure in finding that they contained\r\nfive members of the Besan\xc3\xa7on congregation and that amongst those who\r\nwere strangers to the town were the names of MM. Valenod, de Moirod,\r\nde Cholin. I can answer for these eight jurymen he said to Mathilde.\r\nThe first five are mere machines, Valenod is my agent: Moirod owes me\r\neverything: de Cholin is an imbecile who is frightened of everything.\r\n\r\nThe journal published the names of the jurymen throughout the\r\ndepartment, and to her husband\'s unspeakable terror, madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nwished to go to Besan\xc3\xa7on. All that M. de R\xc3\xaanal could prevail on her\r\nto promise was that she would not leave her bed so as to avoid the\r\nunpleasantness of being called to give evidence. "You do not understand\r\nmy position," said the former mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res. "I am now said to\r\nbe disloyal and a Liberal. No doubt that scoundrel Valenod and M. de\r\nFrilair will get the procureur-general and the judges to do all they\r\ncan to cause me unpleasantness."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal found no difficulty in yielding to her husband\'s\r\norders. "If I appear at the assize court," she said to herself, "I\r\nshould seem as if I were asking for vengeance." In spite of all the\r\npromises she had made to the director of her conscience and to her\r\nhusband that she would be discreet, she had scarcely arrived at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on before she wrote with her own hand to each of the thirty-six\r\njurymen:--\r\n\r\n"I shall not appear on the day of the trial, monsieur, because my\r\npresence might be prejudicial to M. Sorel\'s case. I only desire one\r\nthing in the world, and that I desire passionately--for him to be\r\nsaved. Have no doubt about it, the awful idea that I am the cause of an\r\ninnocent man being led to his death would poison the rest of my life\r\nand would no doubt curtail it. How can you condemn him to death while I\r\ncontinue to live? No, there is no doubt about it, society has no right\r\nto take away a man\'s life, and above all, the life of a being like\r\nJulien Sorel. Everyone at Verri\xc3\xa8res knew that there were moments when\r\nhe was quite distracted. This poor young man has some powerful enemies,\r\nbut even among his enemies, (and how many has he not got?) who is there\r\nwho casts any doubt on his admirable talents and his deep knowledge?\r\nThe man whom you are going to try, monsieur, is not an ordinary person.\r\nFor a period of nearly eighteen months we all knew him as a devout and\r\nwell behaved student. Two or three times in the year he was seized by\r\nfits of melancholy that went to the point of distraction. The whole\r\ntown of Verri\xc3\xa8res, all our neighbours at Vergy, where we live in the\r\nfine weather, my whole family, and monsieur the sub-prefect himself\r\nwill render justice to his exemplary piety. He knows all the Holy Bible\r\nby heart. Would a blasphemer have spent years of study in learning the\r\nSacred Book. My sons will have the honour of presenting you with this\r\nletter, they are children. Be good enough to question them, monsieur,\r\nthey will give you all the details concerning this poor young man which\r\nare necessary to convince you of how barbarous it would be to condemn\r\nhim. Far from revenging me, you would be putting me to death.\r\n\r\n"What can his enemies argue against this? The wound, which was the\r\nresult of one of those moments of madness, which my children themselves\r\nused to remark in their tutor, is so little dangerous than in less\r\nthan two months it has allowed me to take the post from Verri\xc3\xa8res to\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on. If I learn, monsieur, that you show the slightest hesitation\r\nin releasing so innocent a person from the barbarity of the law, I will\r\nleave my bed, where I am only kept by my husband\'s express orders, and\r\nI will go and throw myself at your feet. Bring in a verdict, monsieur,\r\nthat the premeditation has not been made out, and you will not have an\r\ninnocent man\'s blood on your head, etc."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n        The country will remember this celebrated case for\r\n        a long time. The interest in the accused amounted\r\n        to an agitation. The reason was that his crime was\r\n        astonishing, and yet not atrocious. Even if it had been,\r\n        this young man was so handsome. His brilliant career,\r\n        that came to an end so early in his life, intensified\r\n        the pathos. "Will they condemn him?" the women asked of\r\n        the men of their acquaintance, and they could be seen to\r\n        grow pale as they waited for the answer.--_Sainte Beuve_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day that madame de R\xc3\xaanal and Mathilde feared so much arrived at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nTheir terror was intensified by the strange appearance of the town,\r\nwhich had its emotional effect even upon Fouqu\xc3\xa9\'s sturdy soul. All the\r\nprovince had rushed to Besan\xc3\xa7on to see the trial of this romantic case.\r\n\r\nThere had been no room left in the inns for some days. M. the president\r\nof the assizes, was besieged by requests for tickets; all the ladies\r\nin the town wanted to be present at the trial. Julien\'s portrait was\r\nhawked about the streets, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMathilde was keeping in reserve for this supreme moment a complete\r\nautograph letter from my lord, bishop of ----. This prelate, who\r\ngoverned the Church of France and created its bishops, was good enough\r\nto ask for Julien\'s acquittal. On the eve of the trial, Mathilde took\r\nthis letter to the all-powerful grand vicar.\r\n\r\nWhen she was going away in tears at the end of the interview, M.\r\nde Frilair at last emerged from his diplomatic reserve and almost\r\nshewed some emotion himself. "I will be responsible for the jury\'s\r\nverdict," he said to her. "Out of the twelve persons charged with the\r\ninvestigation of whether your friend\'s crime is made out, and above\r\nall, whether there was premeditation, I can count six friends who are\r\ndevoted to my fortunes, and I have given them to understand that they\r\nhave it in their power to promote me to the episcopate. Baron Valenod,\r\nwhom I have made mayor of Verri\xc3\xa8res, can do just as he likes with two\r\nof his officials, MM. de Moirod, and de Cholin. As a matter of fact,\r\nfate has given us for this business two jurymen of extremely loose\r\nviews; but, although ultra-Liberals, they are faithful to my orders on\r\ngreat occasions, and I have requested them to vote like M. Valenod.\r\nI have learnt that a sixth juryman, a manufacturer, who is immensely\r\nrich, and a garrulous Liberal into the bargain, has secret aspirations\r\nfor a contract with the War Office, and doubtless he would not like to\r\ndisplease me. I have had him told that M. de Valenod knows my final\r\ninjunctions."\r\n\r\n"And who is this M. Valenod?" said Mathilde, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"If you knew him, you could not doubt our success. He is an audacious\r\nspeaker, coarse, impudent, with a natural gift for managing fools. 1814\r\nsaw him in low water, and I am going to make a prefect of him. He is\r\ncapable of beating the other jurymen if they do not vote his way."\r\n\r\nMathilde felt a little reassured.\r\n\r\nAnother discussion awaited her in the evening. To avoid the\r\nprolongation of an unpleasant scene, the result of which, in his view,\r\nwas absolutely certain, Julien had resolved not to make a speech.\r\n\r\n"My advocate will speak," he said to Mathilde. "I shall figure too long\r\nanyway as a laughing-stock to all my enemies. These provincials have\r\nbeen shocked by the rapidity of my success, for which I have to thank\r\nyou, and believe me, there is not one of them who does not desire my\r\nconviction, though he would be quite ready to cry like an idiot when I\r\nam taken to my death."\r\n\r\n"They desire to see you humiliated. That is only too true," answered\r\nMathilde, "but I do not think they are at all cruel. My presence at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on, and the sight of my sufferings have interested all the women;\r\nyour handsome face will do the rest. If you say a few words to your\r\njudges, the whole audience will be on your side, etc., etc."\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock on the following day, when Julien left his prison\r\nfor the great hall of the Palais de Justice, the gendarmes had much\r\ndifficulty in driving away the immense crowd that was packed in the\r\ncourtyard. Julien had slept well. He was very calm, and experienced no\r\nother sentiment except a sense of philosophic pity towards that crowd\r\nof jealous creatures who were going to applaud his death sentence,\r\nthough without cruelty. He was very surprised when, having been\r\ndetained in the middle of the crowd more than a quarter of an hour,\r\nhe was obliged to admit that his presence affected the public with\r\na tender pity. He did not hear a single unpleasant remark. "These\r\nprovincials are less evil than I thought," he said to himself.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the courtroom, he was struck by the elegance of the\r\narchitecture. It was real Gothic, with a number of pretty little\r\ncolumns hewn out of stone with the utmost care. He thought himself in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBut his attention was soon engrossed by twelve or fifteen pretty\r\nwomen, who sat exactly opposite the prisoner\'s seat and filled the\r\nthree balconies above the judges and the jury. As he turned round\r\ntowards the public, he saw that the circular gallery that dominated the\r\namphitheatre was filled with women, the majority were young and seemed\r\nvery pretty, their eyes were shining and full of interest. The crowd\r\nwas enormous throughout the rest of the room. People were knocking\r\nagainst the door, and the janitors could not obtain silence.\r\n\r\nWhen all the eyes that were looking for Julien observed where he was,\r\nand saw him occupying the slightly raised place which is reserved for\r\nthe prisoner, he was greeted by a murmur of astonishment and tender\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nYou would have taken him for under twenty on this day. He was dressed\r\nvery simply, but with a perfect grace. His hair and his forehead were\r\ncharming. Mathilde had insisted on officiating personally at his\r\ntoilette. Julien\'s pallor was extreme. Scarcely was he seated in this\r\nplace than he heard people say all over the room, "Great heavens! how\r\nyoung he is!... But he\'s quite a child!... He is much better than his\r\nportrait."\r\n\r\n"Prisoner," said the gendarme who was sitting on his right, "do you see\r\nthose six ladies in that balcony?" The gendarme pointed out a little\r\ngallery that jutted out over the amphitheatre where the jury were\r\nplaced. "That\'s madame, the prefect\'s wife," continued the gendarme.\r\n"Next to her, madame the marquise de M----. She likes you well: I have\r\nheard her speak to the judge of first instance. Next to her is madame\r\nDerville."\r\n\r\n"Madame Derville!" exclaimed Julien, and a vivid blush spread over his\r\nforehead. "When she leaves here," he thought, "she will write to madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal." He was ignorant of madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s arrival at Besan\xc3\xa7on.\r\nThe witnesses were quickly heard. After the first words of the opening\r\nof the prosecution by the advocate-general, two of the ladies in the\r\nlittle balcony just opposite Julien burst into tears. Julien noticed\r\nthat madame Derville did not break down at all. He remarked, however,\r\nthat she was very red.\r\n\r\nThe advocate-general was indulging in melodrama in bad French over the\r\nbarbarity of the crime that had been perpetrated. Julien noticed that\r\nmadame Derville\'s neighbours seemed to manifest a keen disapproval.\r\nSeveral jurors, who were apparently acquainted with the ladies, spoke\r\nto them and seemed to reassure them. "So far as it goes, that is\r\ncertainly a good omen," thought Julien.\r\n\r\nUp to the present, he had felt himself steeped in an unadulterated\r\ncontempt for all the persons who were present at the trial. This\r\nsentiment of disgust was intensified by the stale eloquence of\r\nthe advocate-general. But the coldness of Julien\'s soul gradually\r\ndisappeared before the marks of interest of which he was evidently the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied with the sturdy demeanour of his advocate. "No\r\nphrases," he said to him in a whisper, as he was about to commence his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n"All the bombast which our opponent has stolen from Bossuet and\r\nlavished upon you," said the advocate, "has done you good."\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, he had scarcely spoken for five minutes before\r\npractically all the women had their handkerchiefs in their hands. The\r\nadvocate was encouraged, and addressed some extremely strong remarks\r\nto the jury. Julien shuddered. He felt on the point of breaking into\r\ntears. "My God," he thought, "what would my enemies say?"\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of succumbing to the emotion which was overcoming\r\nhim, when, luckily for him, he surprised an insolent look from M. the\r\nbaron de Valenod.\r\n\r\n"That rogue\'s eyes are gleaming," he said to himself "What a triumph\r\nfor that base soul! If my crime had only produced this one result, it\r\nwould be my duty to curse it. God knows what he will say about it to\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal."\r\n\r\nThis idea effaced all others. Shortly afterwards Julien was brought\r\nback to reality by the public\'s manifestation of applause. The advocate\r\nhad just finished his speech. Julien remembered that it was good form\r\nto shake hands with him. The time had passed rapidly.\r\n\r\nThey brought in refreshments for the advocate and the prisoner. It was\r\nonly then that Julien was struck by the fact that none of the women had\r\nleft the audience to go and get dinner.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I am dying of hunger," said the advocate. "And you?"\r\n\r\n"I, too," answered Julien.\r\n\r\n"See, there\'s madame, the prefect\'s wife, who is also getting her\r\ndinner," said the advocate, as he pointed out the little balcony. "Keep\r\nup your courage; everything is going all right." The court sat again.\r\n\r\nMidnight struck as the president was summing up. The president was\r\nobliged to pause in his remarks. Amid the silence and the anxiety of\r\nall present, the reverberation of the clock filled the hall.\r\n\r\n"So my last day is now beginning," thought Julien. He soon felt\r\ninflamed by the idea of his duty. Up to the present he had controlled\r\nhis emotion and had kept his resolution not to speak. When the\r\npresident of the assizes asked him if he had anything to add, he got\r\nup. He saw in front of him the eyes of madame Derville, which seemed\r\nvery brilliant in the artificial light. "Can she by any chance be\r\ncrying?" he thought.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen of the jury!\r\n\r\n"I am induced to speak by my fear of that contempt which I thought,\r\nat the very moment of my death, I should be able to defy. Gentlemen,\r\nI have not the honour of belonging to your class. You behold in me a\r\npeasant who has rebelled against the meanness of his fortune.\r\n\r\n"I do not ask you for any pardon," continued Julien, with a firmer\r\nnote in his voice. "I am under no illusions. Death awaits me; it\r\nwill be just. I have brought myself to make an attempt on the life\r\nof the woman who is most worthy of all reverence and all respect.\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was a mother to me. My crime was atrocious, and it\r\nwas premeditated. Consequently, I have deserved death, gentlemen of\r\nthe jury. But even if I were not so guilty, I see among you men who,\r\nwithout a thought for any pity that may be due to my youth, would like\r\nto use me as a means for punishing and discouraging for ever that class\r\nof young man who, though born in an inferior class, and to some extent\r\noppressed by poverty, have none the less been fortunate enough to\r\nobtain a good education, and bold enough to mix with what the pride of\r\nthe rich calls Society.\r\n\r\n"That is my crime, gentlemen, and it will be punished with even more\r\nseverity, inasmuch as, in fact, I am very far from being judged by my\r\npeers. I do not see on the jury benches any peasant who has made money,\r\nbut only indignant bourgeois...."\r\n\r\nJulien talked in this strain for twenty minutes. He said everything\r\nhe had on his mind. The advocate-general, who aspired to the favours\r\nof the aristocracy, writhed in his seat. But in spite of the somewhat\r\nabstract turn which Julien had given to his speech, all the women\r\nburst out into tears. Even madame Derville put her handkerchief to\r\nher eyes. Before finishing, Julien alluded again to the fact of his\r\npremeditation, to his repentance, and to the respect and unbounded\r\nfilial admiration which, in happier days, he had entertained for madame\r\nde R\xc3\xaanal.... Madame Derville gave a cry and fainted.\r\n\r\nOne o\'clock was striking when the jury retired to their room. None of\r\nthe women had left their places; several men had tears in their eyes.\r\nThe conversations were at first very animated, but, as there was a\r\ndelay in the verdict of the jury, their general fatigue gradually began\r\nto invest the gathering with an atmosphere of calm. It was a solemn\r\nmoment; the lights grew less brilliant. Julien, who was very tired,\r\nheard people around him debating the question of whether this delay was\r\na good or a bad omen. He was pleased to see that all the wishes were\r\nfor him. The jury did not come back, and yet not a woman left the court.\r\n\r\nWhen two o\'clock had struck, a great movement was heard. The little\r\ndoor of the jury room opened. M. the baron de Valenod advanced with\r\na slow and melodramatic step. He was followed by all the jurors. He\r\ncoughed, and then declared on his soul and conscience that the jury\'s\r\nunanimous verdict was that Julien Sorel was guilty of murder, and of\r\nmurder with premeditation. This verdict involved the death penalty,\r\nwhich was pronounced a moment afterwards. Julien looked at his watch,\r\nand remembered M. de Lavalette. It was a quarter past two. "To-day is\r\nFriday," he thought.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but this day is lucky for the Valenod who has got me\r\nconvicted.... I am watched too well for Mathilde to manage to save me\r\nlike madame de Lavalette saved her husband.... So in three days\' time,\r\nat this very hour, I shall know what view to take about the great\r\nperhaps."\r\n\r\nAt this moment he heard a cry and was called back to the things of this\r\nworld. The women around him were sobbing: he saw that all faces were\r\nturned towards a little gallery built into the crowning of a Gothic\r\npilaster. He knew later that Mathilde had concealed herself there. As\r\nthe cry was not repeated, everybody began to look at Julien again, as\r\nthe gendarmes were trying to get him through the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Let us try not to give that villain Valenod any chance of laughing\r\nat me," thought Julien. "With what a contrite sycophantic expression\r\nhe pronounced the verdict which entails the death penalty, while that\r\npoor president of the assizes, although he has been a judge for years\r\nand years, had tears in his eyes as he sentenced me. What a joy the\r\nValenod must find in revenging himself for our former rivalry for\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s favors! ... So I shall never see her again! The thing\r\nis finished.... A last good-bye between us is impossible--I feel it....\r\nHow happy I should have been to have told her all the horror I feel for\r\nmy crime!\r\n\r\n"Mere words. I consider myself justly convicted."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Julien was taken back to prison he had been taken into a room\r\nintended for those who were condemned to death. Although a man who in\r\nthe usual way would notice the most petty details, he had quite failed\r\nto observe that he had not been taken up to his turret. He was thinking\r\nof what he would say to madame de R\xc3\xaanal if he had the happiness of\r\nseeing her before the final moment. He thought that she would break\r\ninto what he was saying and was anxious to be able to express his\r\nabsolute repentance with his very first words. "How can I convince her\r\nthat I love her alone after committing an action like that? For after\r\nall, it was either out of ambition, or out of love for Mathilde, that I\r\nwanted to kill her."\r\n\r\nAs he went to bed, he came across sheets of a rough coarse material.\r\n"Ah! I am in the condemned cell, he said to himself. That is right.\r\n\r\n"Comte Altamira used to tell me that Danton, on the eve of his death,\r\nwould say in his loud voice: \'it is singular but you cannot conjugate\r\nthe verb guillotine in all its tenses: of course you can say, I shall\r\nbe guillotined, thou shalt be guillotined, but you don\'t say, I have\r\nbeen guillotined.\'\r\n\r\n"Why not?" went on Julien, "if there is another life.... Upon my word,\r\nit will be all up with me if I find the God of the Christians there: He\r\nis a tyrant, and as such, he is full of ideas of vengeance: his Bible\r\nspeaks of nothing but atrocious punishment. I never liked him--I could\r\nnever get myself to believe that anyone really liked him. He has no\r\npity (and he remembered several passages in the Bible) he will punish\r\nme atrociously.\r\n\r\n"But supposing I find F\xc3\xa9nelon\'s God: He will perhaps say to me: \'Much\r\nforgiveness will be vouchsafed to thee, inasmuch as thou hast loved\r\nmuch.\'\r\n\r\n"Have I loved much? Ah! I loved madame de R\xc3\xaanal, but my conduct has\r\nbeen atrocious. In that, as in other cases, simple modest merit was\r\nabandoned for the sake of what was brilliant.\r\n\r\n"But still, what fine prospects? Colonel of Hussars, if we had had a\r\nwar: secretary of a legation during peace: then ambassador ... for\r\nI should soon have picked up politics ... and even if I had been an\r\nidiot, would the marquis de la Mole\'s son-in-law have had any rivalry\r\nto fear? All my stupidities have been forgiven, or rather, counted\r\nas merits. A man of merit, then, and living in the grandest style at\r\nVienna or London.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly, monsieur. Guillotined in three days\' time."\r\n\r\nJulien laughed heartily at this sally of his wit. "As a matter of fact,\r\nman has two beings within him, he thought. Who the devil can have\r\nthought of such a sinister notion?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, my friend: guillotined in three days," he answered the\r\ninterruptor. "M. de Cholin will hire a window and share the expense\r\nwith the abb\xc3\xa9 Maslon. Well, which of those two worthy personages\r\nwill rob the other over the price paid for hiring that window?" The\r\nfollowing passage from Rotrou\'s "Venceslas" suddenly came back into his\r\nmind:--\r\n\r\n              LADISLAS\r\n    .................Mon \xc3\xa2me est toute pr\xc3\xaate.\r\n    THE KING, _father of Ladislas_.\r\n    L\'\xc3\xa9chafaud l\'est aussi: portez-y-votre t\xc3\xaate.\r\n\r\n"A good repartee" he thought, as he went to sleep. He was awakened in\r\nthe morning by someone catching hold of him violently.\r\n\r\n"What! already," said Julien, opening his haggard eyes. He thought he\r\nwas already in the executioner\'s hands.\r\n\r\nIt was Mathilde. "Luckily, she has not understood me." This reflection\r\nrestored all his self possession. He found Mathilde as changed as\r\nthough she had gone through a six months\' illness: she was really not\r\nrecognisable.\r\n\r\n"That infamous Frilair has betrayed me," she said to him, wringing her\r\nhands. Her fury prevented her from crying.\r\n\r\n"Was I not fine when I made my speech yesterday?" answered Julien. "I\r\nwas improvising for the first time in my life! It is true that it is to\r\nbe feared that it will also be the last."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Julien was playing on Mathilde\'s character with all\r\nthe self-possession of a clever pianist, whose fingers are on the\r\ninstrument.... "It is true," he added, "that I lack the advantage of a\r\ndistinguished birth, but Mathilde\'s great soul has lifted her lover up\r\nto her own level. Do you think that Boniface de la Mole would have cut\r\na better figure before his judges?"\r\n\r\nOn this particular day, Mathilde was as unaffectedly tender as a poor\r\ngirl living in a fifth storey. But she failed to extract from him any\r\nsimpler remark. He was paying her back without knowing it for all the\r\ntorture she had frequently inflicted on him.\r\n\r\n"The sources of the Nile are unknown," said Julien to himself: "it has\r\nnot been vouchsafed to the human eye to see the king of rivers as a\r\nsimple brook: similarly, no human eye shall see Julien weak. In the\r\nfirst place because he is not so. But I have a heart which it is easy\r\nto touch. The most commonplace words, if said in a genuine tone, can\r\nmake my voice broken and even cause me to shed tears. How often have\r\nfrigid characters not despised me for this weakness. They thought that\r\nI was asking a favour: that is what I cannot put up with.\r\n\r\n"It is said that when at the foot of the scaffold, Danton was affected\r\nby the thought of his wife: but Danton had given strength to a nation\r\nof coxcombs and prevented the enemy from reaching Paris.... I alone\r\nknow what I should have been able to do.... I represent to the others\r\nat the very outside, simply A PERHAPS.\r\n\r\n"If madame de R\xc3\xaanal had been here in my cell instead of Mathilde,\r\nshould I have been able to have answered for myself? The extremity of\r\nmy despair and my repentance would have been taken for a craven fear of\r\ndeath by the Valenods and all the patricians of the locality. They are\r\nso proud, are those feeble spirits, whom their pecuniary position puts\r\nabove temptation! \'You see what it is to be born a carpenter\'s son,\'\r\nM. de Moirod and de Cholin doubtless said after having condemned me to\r\ndeath! \'A man can learn to be learned and clever, but the qualities of\r\nthe heart--the qualities of the heart cannot be learnt.\' Even in the\r\ncase of this poor Mathilde, who is crying now, or rather, who cannot\r\ncry," he said to himself, as he looked at her red eyes.... And he\r\nclasped her in his arms: the sight of a genuine grief made him forget\r\nthe sequence of his logic.... "She has perhaps cried all the night," he\r\nsaid to himself, "but how ashamed she will be of this memory on some\r\nfuture day! She will regard herself as having been led astray in her\r\nfirst youth by a plebeian\'s low view of life.... Le Croisenois is weak\r\nenough to marry her, and upon my word, he will do well to do so. She\r\nwill make him play a part."\r\n\r\n    "Du droit qu\'un esprit ferme et vaste en ses desseins\r\n    A sur l\'esprit grossier des vulgaires humaines."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s really humorous; since I have been doomed to die, all the\r\nverses I ever knew in my life are coming back into my memory. It must\r\nbe a sign of demoralisation."\r\n\r\nMathilde kept on repeating in a choked voice: "He is there in the next\r\nroom." At last he paid attention to what she was saying. "Her voice is\r\nweak," he thought, "but all the imperiousness of her character comes\r\nout in her intonation. She lowers her voice in order to avoid getting\r\nangry."\r\n\r\n"And who is there?" he said, gently.\r\n\r\n"The advocate, to get you to sign your appeal."\r\n\r\n"I shall not appeal."\r\n\r\n"What! you will not appeal," she said, getting up, with her eyes\r\nsparkling with rage. "And why, if you please?"\r\n\r\n"Because I feel at the present time that I have the courage to die\r\nwithout giving people occasion to laugh too much at my expense. And\r\nwho will guarantee that I shall be in so sound a frame of mind in two\r\nmonths\' time, after living for a long time in this damp cell? I foresee\r\ninterviews with the priests, with my father. I can imagine nothing more\r\nunpleasant. Let\'s die."\r\n\r\nThis unexpected opposition awakened all the haughtiness of Mathilde\'s\r\ncharacter. She had not managed to see the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair before the\r\ntime when visitors were admitted to the cells in the Besan\xc3\xa7on prison.\r\nHer fury vented itself on Julien. She adored him, and nevertheless she\r\nexhibited for a good quarter of an hour in her invective against his,\r\nJulien\'s, character, and her regret at having ever loved him, the\r\nsame haughty soul which had formerly overwhelmed him with such cutting\r\ninsults in the library of the H\xc3\xb4tel de la Mole.\r\n\r\n"In justice to the glory of your stock, Heaven should have had you born\r\na man," he said to her.\r\n\r\n"But as for myself," he thought, "I should be very foolish to go on\r\nliving for two more months in this disgusting place, to serve as a\r\nbutt for all the infamous humiliations which the patrician party can\r\ndevise,[2] and having the outburst of this mad woman for my only\r\nconsolation.... Well, the morning after to-morrow I shall fight a duel\r\nwith a man known for his self-possession and his remarkable skill ...\r\nhis very remarkable skill," said the Mephistophelian part of him; "he\r\nnever makes a miss. Well, so be it--good." (Mathilde continued to wax\r\neloquent). "No, not for a minute," he said to himself, "I shall not\r\nappeal."\r\n\r\nHaving made this resolution, he fell into meditation....\r\n\r\n"The courier will bring the paper at six o\'clock as usual, as he\r\npasses; at eight o\'clock, after M. de R\xc3\xaanal has finished reading it,\r\nElisa will go on tiptoe and place it on her bed. Later on she will wake\r\nup; suddenly, as she reads it she will become troubled; her pretty\r\nhands will tremble; she will go on reading down to these words: _At\r\nfive minutes past ten he had ceased to exist_.\r\n\r\n"She will shed hot tears, I know her; it will matter nothing that I\r\ntried to assassinate her--all will be forgotten, and the person whose\r\nlife I wished to take will be the only one who will sincerely lament my\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s a good paradox," he thought, and he thought about nothing\r\nexcept madame de R\xc3\xaanal during the good quarter of an hour which the\r\nscene Mathilde was making still lasted. In spite of himself, and though\r\nhe made frequent answers to what Mathilde was saying, he could not take\r\nhis mind away from the thought of the bedroom at Verri\xc3\xa8res. He saw the\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on Gazette on the counterpane of orange taffeta; he saw that\r\nwhite hand clutching at it convulsively. He saw madame de R\xc3\xaanal cry....\r\nHe followed the path of every tear over her charming face.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole, being unable to get anything out of Julien,\r\nasked the advocate to come in. Fortunately, he was an old captain of\r\nthe Italian army of 1796, where he had been a comrade of Manuel.\r\n\r\nHe opposed the condemned man\'s resolution as a matter of form. Wishing\r\nto treat him with respect, Julien explained all his reasons.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I can understand a man taking the view you do," said\r\nM. Felix Vaneau (that was the advocate\'s name) to him at last. "But\r\nyou have three full days in which to appeal, and it is my duty to come\r\nback every day. If a volcano were to open under the prison between now\r\nand two months\' time you would be saved. You might die of illness," he\r\nsaid, looking at Julien.\r\n\r\nJulien pressed his hand--"I thank you, you are a good fellow. I will\r\nthink it over."\r\n\r\nAnd when Mathilde eventually left with the advocate, he felt much more\r\naffection for the advocate than for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] There is no heading to this and the following chapters in the\r\noriginal.--TRANSL.\r\n\r\n[2] The speaker is a Jacobin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he was deep asleep an hour afterwards, he was woken up by feeling\r\ntears flow over his hand. "Oh, it is Mathilde again," he thought, only\r\nhalf awake. "She has come again, faithful to her tactics of attacking\r\nmy resolution by her sentimentalism." Bored by the prospect of this\r\nnew scene of hackneyed pathos he did not open his eyes. The verses of\r\nBelphgor, as he ran away from his wife, came into his mind. He heard a\r\nstrange sigh. He opened his eyes. It was madame de R\xc3\xaanal.\r\n\r\n"Ah, so I see you again before I die, or is it an illusion," he\r\nexclaimed as he threw himself at her feet.\r\n\r\n"But, forgive me, madame, you must look upon me as a mere murderer," he\r\nsaid, immediately, as he recovered himself.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, I have come to entreat you to appeal; I know you do not want\r\nto...." her sobs choked her; she was unable to speak.\r\n\r\n"Deign to forgive me."\r\n\r\n"If you want me to forgive you," she said to him, getting up and\r\nthrowing herself into his arms, "appeal immediately against your death\r\nsentence."\r\n\r\nJulien covered her with kisses.\r\n\r\n"Will you come and see me every day during those two months?"\r\n\r\n"I swear it--every day, unless my husband forbids me."\r\n\r\n"I will sign it," exclaimed Julien.\r\n\r\n"What! you really forgive me! Is it possible?"\r\n\r\nHe clasped her in his arms; he was mad. She gave a little cry.\r\n\r\n"It is nothing," she said to him. "You hurt me."\r\n\r\n"Your shoulder," exclaimed Julien, bursting into tears. He drew back\r\na little, and covered her hands with kisses of fire. "Who could\r\nhave prophesied this, dear, the last time I saw you in your room at\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res?"\r\n\r\n"Who could have prophesied then that I should write that infamous\r\nletter to M. de la Mole?"\r\n\r\n"Know that I have always loved you, and that I have never loved anyone\r\nbut you."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?" cried Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, who was delighted in her turn.\r\nShe leant on Julien, who was on his knees, and they cried silently for\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nJulien had never experienced moments like this at any period of his\r\nwhole life.\r\n\r\n"And how about that young madame Michelet?" said Madame de R\xc3\xaanal, a\r\nlong time afterwards when they were able to speak. "Or rather, that\r\nmademoiselle de la Mole? for I am really beginning to believe in that\r\nstrange romance."\r\n\r\n"It is only superficially true," answered Julien. "She is my wife, but\r\nshe is not my mistress."\r\n\r\nAfter interrupting each other a hundred times over, they managed with\r\ngreat difficulty to explain to each other what they did not know. The\r\nletter written to M. de la Mole had been drafted by the young priest\r\nwho directed Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s conscience, and had been subsequently\r\ncopied by her, "What a horrible thing religion has made me do," she\r\nsaid to him, "and even so I softened the most awful passages in the\r\nletter."\r\n\r\nJulien\'s ecstatic happiness proved the fulness of her forgiveness. He\r\nhad never been so mad with love.\r\n\r\n"And yet I regard myself as devout," madame de R\xc3\xaanal went on to say to\r\nhim in the ensuing conversation. "I believe sincerely in God! I equally\r\nbelieve, and I even have full proof of it, that the crime which I am\r\ncommitting is an awful one, and yet the very minute I see you, even\r\nafter you have fired two pistol shots at me--" and at this point, in\r\nspite of her resistance, Julien covered her with kisses.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone," she continued, "I want to argue with you, I am\r\nfrightened lest I should forget.... The very minute I see you all my\r\nduties disappear. I have nothing but love for you, dear, or rather, the\r\nword love is too weak. I feel for you what I ought only to feel for\r\nGod; a mixture of respect, love, obedience.... As a matter of fact, I\r\ndon\'t know what you inspire me with.... If you were to tell me to stab\r\nthe gaoler with a knife, the crime would be committed before I had\r\ngiven it a thought. Explain this very clearly to me before I leave you.\r\nI want to see down to the bottom of my heart; for we shall take leave\r\nof each other in two months.... By the bye, shall we take leave of each\r\nother?" she said to him with a smile.\r\n\r\n"I take back my words," exclaimed Julien, getting up, "I shall not\r\nappeal from my death sentence, if you try, either by poison, knife,\r\npistol, charcoal, or any other means whatsoever, to put an end to your\r\nlife, or make any attempt upon it."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s expression suddenly changed. The most lively\r\ntenderness was succeeded by a mood of deep meditation.\r\n\r\n"Supposing we were to die at once," she said to him.\r\n\r\n"Who knows what one will find in the other life," answered Julien,\r\n"perhaps torment, perhaps nothing at all. Cannot we pass two delicious\r\nmonths together? Two months means a good many days. I shall never have\r\nbeen so happy."\r\n\r\n"You will never have been so happy?"\r\n\r\n"Never," repeated Julien ecstatically, "and I am talking to you just as\r\nI should talk to myself. May God save me from exaggerating."\r\n\r\n"Words like that are a command," she said with a timid melancholy smile.\r\n\r\n"Well, you will swear by the love you have for me, to make no attempt\r\neither direct or indirect, upon your life ... remember," he added,\r\n"that you must live for my son, whom Mathilde will hand over to lackeys\r\nas soon as she is marquise de Croisenois."\r\n\r\n"I swear," she answered coldly, "but I want to take away your notice\r\nof appeal, drawn and signed by yourself. I will go myself to M. the\r\nprocureur-general."\r\n\r\n"Be careful, you will compromise yourself."\r\n\r\n"After having taken the step of coming to see you in your prison, I\r\nshall be a heroine of local scandal for Besan\xc3\xa7on, and the whole of\r\nFranche-Comt\xc3\xa9," she said very dejectedly. "I have crossed the bounds of\r\naustere modesty.... I am a woman who has lost her honour; it is true\r\nthat it is for your sake...."\r\n\r\nHer tone was so sad that Julien embraced her with a happiness which was\r\nquite novel to him. It was no longer the intoxication of love, it was\r\nextreme gratitude. He had just realised for the first time the full\r\nextent of the sacrifice which she had made for him.\r\n\r\nSome charitable soul, no doubt informed M. de R\xc3\xaanal of the long visits\r\nwhich his wife paid to Julien\'s prison; for at the end of three days\r\nhe sent her his carriage with the express order to return to Verri\xc3\xa8res\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThis cruel separation had been a bad beginning for Julien\'s day. He\r\nwas informed two or three hours later that a certain intriguing priest\r\n(who had, however, never managed to make any headway among the Jesuits\r\nof Besan\xc3\xa7on) had, since the morning, established himself in the street\r\noutside the prison gates. It was raining a great deal, and the man out\r\nthere was pretending to play the martyr. Julien was in a weak mood, and\r\nthis piece of stupidity annoyed him deeply.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, he had already refused this priest\'s visit, but the man\r\nhad taken it into his head to confess Julien, and to win a name for\r\nhimself among the young women of Besan\xc3\xa7on by all the confidences which\r\nhe would pretend to have received from him.\r\n\r\nHe declared in a loud voice that he would pass the day and the night by\r\nthe prison gates. "God has sent me to touch the heart of this apostate\r\n..." and the lower classes, who are always curious to see a scene,\r\nbegan to make a crowd.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my brothers," he said to them, "I will pass the day here and the\r\nnight, as well as all the days and all the nights which will follow.\r\nThe Holy Ghost has spoken to me. I am commissioned from above; I am the\r\nman who must save the soul of young Sorel. Do you join in my prayers,\r\netc."\r\n\r\nJulien had a horror of scandal, and of anything which could attract\r\nattention to him. He thought of seizing the opportunity of escaping\r\nfrom the world incognito; but he had some hope of seeing madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal again, and he was desperately in love.\r\n\r\nThe prison gates were situated in one of the most populous streets. His\r\nsoul was tortured by the idea of this filthy priest attracting a crowd\r\nand creating a scandal--"and doubtless he is repeating my name at every\r\nsingle minute!" This moment was more painful than death.\r\n\r\nHe called the turnkey who was devoted to him, and sent sent him two or\r\nthree times at intervals of one hour to see if the priest was still by\r\nthe prison gates.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said the turnkey to him on each occasion, "he is on both\r\nhis knees in the mud; he is praying at the top of his voice, and saying\r\nlitanies for your soul.\r\n\r\n"The impudent fellow," thought Julien. At this moment he actually heard\r\na dull buzz. It was the responses of the people to the litanies. His\r\npatience was strained to the utmost when he saw the turnkey himself\r\nmove his lips while he repeated the Latin words.\r\n\r\n"They are beginning to say," added the turnkey, "that you must have a\r\nvery hardened heart to refuse the help of this holy man."\r\n\r\n"Oh my country, how barbarous you still are!" exclaimed Julien, beside\r\nhimself with anger. And he continued his train of thought aloud,\r\nwithout giving a thought to the turn-key\'s presence.\r\n\r\n"The man wants an article in the paper about him, and that\'s a way in\r\nwhich he will certainly get it.\r\n\r\n"Oh you cursed provincials! At Paris I should not be subjected to all\r\nthese annoyances. There they are more skilled in their charlatanism.\r\n\r\n"Show in the holy priest," he said at last to the turnkey, and great\r\nstreams of sweat flowed down his forehead. The turnkey made the sign of\r\nthe cross and went out rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThe holy priest turned out to be very ugly, he was even dirtier than he\r\nwas ugly. The cold rain intensified the obscurity and dampness of the\r\ncell. The priest wanted to embrace Julien, and began to wax pathetic as\r\nhe spoke to him. The basest hypocrisy was only too palpable; Julien had\r\nnever been so angry in his whole life.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour after the priest had come in Julien felt an\r\nabsolute coward. Death appeared horrible to him for the first time. He\r\nbegan to think about the state of decomposition which his body would be\r\nin two days after the execution, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of betraying himself by some sign of weakness or\r\nthrowing himself on the priest and strangling him with his chain, when\r\nit occurred to him to beg the holy man to go and say a good forty franc\r\nmass for him on that very day.\r\n\r\nIt was twelve o\'clock, so the priest took himself off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had gone out Julien wept desperately and for a long time.\r\nHe gradually admitted to himself that if madame de R\xc3\xaanal had been at\r\nBesan\xc3\xa7on he would have confessed his weakness to her. The moment when\r\nhe was regretting the absence of this beloved woman he heard Mathilde\'s\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n"The worst evil of being in prison," he thought "is one\'s inability to\r\nclose one\'s door." All Mathilde said only irritated him.\r\n\r\nShe told him that M. de Valenod had had his nomination to the\r\nprefectship in his pocket on the day of his trial, and had consequently\r\ndared to defy M. de Frilair and give himself the pleasure of condemning\r\nhim to death.\r\n\r\n"Why did your friend take it into his head," M. de Frilair just said\r\nto me, "to awaken and attack the petty vanity of that bourgeois\r\naristocracy. Why talk about caste? He pointed out to them what they\r\nought to do in their own political interest; the fools had not been\r\ngiving it a thought and were quite ready to weep. That caste interest\r\nintervened and blinded their eyes to the horror of condemning a man to\r\ndeath. One must admit that M. Sorel is very inexperienced. If we do not\r\nsucceed in saving him by a petition for a reprieve, his death will be a\r\nkind of suicide."\r\n\r\nMathilde was careful not to tell Julien a matter concerning which she\r\nhad now no longer any doubts; it was that the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair seeing\r\nthat Julien was ruined, had thought that it would further his ambitious\r\nprojects to try and become his successor.\r\n\r\n"Go and listen to a mass for me," he said to Mathilde, almost beside\r\nhimself with vexation and impotent rage, and leave me a moment in\r\npeace. Mathilde who was already very jealous of madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s\r\nvisits and who had just learned of her departure realised the cause of\r\nJulien\'s bad temper and burst into tears.\r\n\r\nHer grief was real; Julien saw this and was only the more irritated. He\r\nhad a crying need of solitude, and how was he to get it?\r\n\r\nEventually Mathilde, after having tried to melt him by every possible\r\nargument, left him alone. But almost at the same moment, Fouqu\xc3\xa9\r\npresented himself.\r\n\r\n"I need to be alone," he said, to this faithful friend, and as he saw\r\nhim hesitate: "I am composing a memorial for my petition for pardon ...\r\none thing more ... do me a favour, and never speak to me about death.\r\nIf I have need of any especial services on that day, let me be the\r\nfirst to speak to you about it."\r\n\r\nWhen Julien had eventually procured solitude, he found himself more\r\nprostrate and more cowardly than he had been before. The little force\r\nwhich this enfeebled soul still possessed had all been spent in\r\nconcealing his condition from mademoiselle de la Mole.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening he found consolation in this idea.\r\n\r\n"If at the very moment this morning, when death seemed so ugly to\r\nme, I had been given notice of my execution, the public eye would\r\nhave acted as a spur to glory, my demeanour would perhaps have had a\r\ncertain stiffness about it, like a nervous fop entering a salon. A few\r\npenetrating people, if there are any amongst these provincial might\r\nhave managed to divine my weakness.... But no one would have seen it."\r\n\r\nAnd he felt relieved of part of his unhappiness. "I am a coward at this\r\nvery moment," he sang to himself, "but no one will know it."\r\n\r\nAn even more unpleasant episode awaited him on the following day. His\r\nfather had been announcing that he would come and see him for some time\r\npast: the old white-haired carpenter appeared in Julien\'s cell before\r\nhe woke up.\r\n\r\nJulien felt weak, he was anticipating the most unpleasant reproaches.\r\nHis painful emotion was intensified by the fact that on this particular\r\nmorning he felt a keen remorse for not loving his father.\r\n\r\n"Chance placed us next to each other in the world," he said to himself,\r\nwhile the turnkey was putting the cell a little in order, "and we have\r\npractically done each other all the harm we possibly could. He has come\r\nto administer the final blow at the moment of my death."\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were without witnesses, the old man commenced his stern\r\nreproaches.\r\n\r\nJulien could not restrain his tears. "What an unworthy weakness," he\r\nsaid to himself querulously. "He will go about everywhere exaggerating\r\nmy lack of courage: what a triumph for the Valenod, and for all the\r\nfatuous hypocrites who rule in Verri\xc3\xa8res! They are very great in\r\nFrance, they combine all the social advantages. But hitherto, I could\r\nat any rate say to myself, it is true they are in receipt of money, and\r\nthat all the honours lavished on them, but I have a noble heart.\r\n\r\n"But here is a witness whom everyone will believe, and who will testify\r\nto the whole of Verri\xc3\xa8res that I shewed weakness when confronted with\r\ndeath, and who will exaggerate it into the bargain! I shall be taken\r\nfor a coward in an ordeal which comes home to all!"\r\n\r\nJulien was nearly desperate. He did not know how to get rid of his\r\nfather. He felt it absolutely beyond his strength to invent a ruse\r\ncapable of deceiving so shrewd an old man.\r\n\r\nHis mind rapidly reviewed all the alternatives. "I have saved some\r\nmoney," he suddenly exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThis inspiration produced a change in the expression of the old man and\r\nin Julien\'s own condition.\r\n\r\n"How ought I to dispose of it?" continued Julien more quietly. The\r\nresult had freed him from any feeling of inferiority.\r\n\r\nThe old carpenter was burning not to let the money slip by him, but\r\nit seemed that Julien wanted to leave part of it to his brothers. He\r\ntalked at length and with animation. Julien felt cynical.\r\n\r\n"Well, the Lord has given me a message with regard to my will. I will\r\ngive a thousand francs to each of my brothers and the rest to you."\r\n\r\n"Very good," said the old man. "The rest is due to me: but since God\r\nhas been gracious enough to touch your heart, your debts ought to be\r\npaid if you wish to die like a good Christian. There are, moreover, the\r\nexpenses of your board and your education, which I advanced to you,\r\nbut which you are not thinking of."\r\n\r\n"Such is paternal love," repeated Julien to himself, dejectedly, when\r\nhe was at last alone. Soon the gaoler appeared.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, I always bring my visitors a good bottle of champagne after\r\nnear relations have come to see them. It is a little dear, six francs a\r\nbottle, but it rejoices the heart."\r\n\r\n"Bring three glasses," said Julien to him, with a childish eagerness,\r\n"and bring in two of the prisoners whom I have heard walking about\r\nin the corridor." The gaoler brought two men into him who had once\r\nbeen condemned to the gallows, and had now been convicted of the same\r\noffence again, and were preparing to return to penal servitude. They\r\nwere very cheerful scoundrels, and really very remarkable by reason of\r\ntheir subtlety, their courage, and their coolness.\r\n\r\n"If you give me twenty francs," said one of them to Julien, "I will\r\ntell you the story of my life in detail. It\'s rich."\r\n\r\n"But you will lie," said Julien.\r\n\r\n"Not me," he answered, "my friend there, who is jealous of my twenty\r\nfrancs will give me away if I say anything untrue."\r\n\r\nHis history was atrocious. It was evidence of a courageous heart which\r\nhad only one passion--that of money.\r\n\r\nAfter their departure Julien was no longer the same man. All his anger\r\nwith himself had disappeared. The awful grief which had been poisoned\r\nand rendered more acute by the weakness of which he had been a victim\r\nsince madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s departure had turned to melancholy.\r\n\r\n"If I had been less taken in by appearances," he said to himself, "I\r\nwould have had a better chance of seeing that the Paris salons are full\r\nof honest men like my father, or clever scoundrels like those felons.\r\nThey are right. The men in the salons never get up in the morning with\r\nthis poignant thought in their minds, how am I going to get my dinner?\r\nThey boast about their honesty and when they are summoned on the jury,\r\nthey take pride in convicting the man who has stolen a silver dish\r\nbecause he felt starving.\r\n\r\n"But if there is a court, and it\'s a question of losing or winning a\r\nportfolio, my worthy salon people will commit crimes exactly similar to\r\nthose, which the need of getting a dinner inspired those two felons to\r\nperpetrate.\r\n\r\n"There is no such thing as natural law, the expression is nothing\r\nmore than a silly anachronism well worthy of the advocate-general who\r\nharried me the other day, and whose grandfather was enriched by one of\r\nthe confiscations of Louis XIV. There is no such thing as right, except\r\nwhen there is a law to forbid a certain thing under pain of punishment.\r\n\r\n"Before law existed, the only natural thing was the strength of the\r\nlion, or the need of a creature who was cold or hungry, to put it\r\nin one word, need. No, the people whom the world honours are merely\r\nvillains who have had the good fortune not to have been caught\r\nred-handed. The prosecutor whom society put on my track was enriched by\r\nan infamous act. I have committed a murder, and I am justly condemned,\r\nbut the Valenod who has condemned me, is by reason alone of that very\r\ndeed, a hundred times more harmful to society.\r\n\r\n"Well," added Julien sadly but not angrily, "in spite of his avarice,\r\nmy father is worth more than all those men. He never loved me.\r\nThe disgrace I bring upon him by an infamous death has proved the\r\nlast straw. That fear of lacking money, that distorted view of the\r\nwickedness of mankind, which is called avarice, make him find a\r\ntremendous consolation and sense of security in a sum of three or four\r\nhundred louis, which I have been able to leave him. Some Sunday, after\r\ndinner, he will shew his gold to all the envious men in Verri\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\'Which of you would not be delighted to have a son guillotined at a\r\nprice like this,\' will be the message they will read in his eyes."\r\n\r\nThis philosophy might be true, but it was of such a character as to\r\nmake him wish for death. In this way five long days went by. He was\r\npolite and gentle to Mathilde, whom he saw was exasperated by the\r\nmost violent jealousy. One evening Julien seriously thought of taking\r\nhis own life. His soul was demoralised by the deep unhappiness in\r\nwhich madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s departure had thrown him. He could no longer\r\nfind pleasure in anything, either in real life or in the sphere of\r\nthe imagination. Lack of exercise began to affect his health, and\r\nto produce in him all the weakness and exaltation of a young German\r\nstudent. He began to lose that virile disdain which repels with a\r\ndrastic oath certain undignified ideas which besiege the soul of the\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\n"I loved truth.... Where is it? Hypocrisy everywhere or at any rate\r\ncharlatanism. Even in the most virtuous, even in the greatest," and his\r\nlips assumed an expression of disgust. "No, man cannot trust man."\r\n\r\n"Madame de ---- when she was making a collection for her poor orphans,\r\nused to tell me that such and such a prince had just given ten louis, a\r\nsheer lie. But what am I talking about. Napoleon at St. Helena ... Pure\r\ncharlatanism like the proclamation in favour of the king of Rome.\r\n\r\n"Great God! If a man like that at a time when misfortune ought to\r\nsummon him sternly to his duty will sink to charlatanism, what is one\r\nto expect from the rest of the human species?"\r\n\r\n"Where is truth? In religion. Yes," he added, with a bitter smile\r\nof utter contempt. "In the mouth of the Maslons, the Frilairs, the\r\nCastan\xc3\xa8des--perhaps in that true Christianity whose priests were not\r\npaid any more than were the apostles. But St. Paul was paid by the\r\npleasure of commanding, speaking, getting himself talked about."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if there were only a true religion. Fool that I am. I see a Gothic\r\ncathedral and venerable stained-glass windows, and my weak heart\r\nconjures up the priest to fit the scene. My soul would understand him,\r\nmy soul has need of him. I only find a nincompoop with dirty hair.\r\nAbout as comforting as a chevalier de Beauvoisis.\r\n\r\n"But a true priest, a Massillon, a F\xc3\xa9nelon. Massillon sacrificed\r\nDubois. Saint-Simon\'s memoirs have spoilt the illusion of F\xc3\xa9nelon, but\r\nhe was a true priest anyway. In those days, tender souls could have a\r\nplace in the world where they could meet together. We should not then\r\nhave been isolated. That good priest would have talked to us of God.\r\nBut what God? Not the one of the Bible, a cruel petty despot, full of\r\nvindictiveness, but the God of Voltaire, just, good, infinite."\r\n\r\nHe was troubled by all the memories of that Bible which he knew by\r\nheart. "But how on earth, when the deity is three people all at the\r\nsame time, is one to believe in the great name of GOD, after the\r\nfrightful way in which our priests have abused it."\r\n\r\n"Living alone. What a torture."\r\n\r\n"I am growing mad and unreasonable," said Julien to himself, striking\r\nhis forehead. "I am alone here in this cell, but I have not lived\r\nalone on earth. I had the powerful idea of duty. The duty which rightly\r\nor wrongly I laid down for myself, has been to me like the trunk of a\r\nsolid tree which I could lean on during the storm, I stumbled, I was\r\nagitated. After all I was only a man, but I was not swept away.\r\n\r\n"It must be the damp air of this cell which made me think of being\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n"Why should I still play the hypocrite by cursing hypocrisy? It is\r\nneither death, nor the cell, nor the damp air, but madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s\r\nabsence which prostrates me. If, in order to see her at Verri\xc3\xa8res, I\r\nhad to live whole weeks at Verri\xc3\xa8res concealed in the cellars of her\r\nhouse, would I complain?"\r\n\r\n"The influence of my contemporaries wins the day," he said aloud, with\r\na bitter laugh. "Though I am talking to myself and within an ace of\r\ndeath, I still play the hypocrite. Oh you nineteenth century! A hunter\r\nfires a gun shot in the forest, his quarry falls, he hastens forward\r\nto seize it. His foot knocks against a two-foot anthill, knocks down\r\nthe dwelling place of the ants, and scatters the ants and their eggs\r\nfar and wide. The most philosophic among the ants will never be able to\r\nunderstand that black, gigantic and terrifying body, the hunter\'s boot,\r\nwhich suddenly invaded their home with incredible rapidity, preceded by\r\na frightful noise, and accompanied by flashes of reddish fire."\r\n\r\n"In the same way, death, life and eternity, are very simple things for\r\nanyone who has organs sufficiently vast to conceive them. An ephemeral\r\nfly is born at nine o\'clock in the morning in the long summer days, to\r\ndie at five o\'clock in the evening. How is it to understand the word\r\n\'night\'?"\r\n\r\n"Give it five more hours of existence, and it will see night, and\r\nunderstand its meaning."\r\n\r\n"So, in my case, I shall die at the age of twenty-three. Give me five\r\nmore years of life in order to live with madame de R\xc3\xaanal."\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh like Mephistopheles. How foolish to debate these\r\ngreat problems.\r\n\r\n"(1). I am as hypocritical as though there were someone there to listen\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n"(2). I am forgetting to live and to love when I have so few days left\r\nto live. Alas, madame de R\xc3\xaanal is absent; perhaps her husband will\r\nnot let her come back to Besan\xc3\xa7on any more, to go on compromising her\r\nhonour."\r\n\r\n"That is what makes me lonely, and not the absence of a God who is\r\njust, good and omnipotent, devoid of malice, and in no wise greedy of\r\nvengeance."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if He did exist. Alas I should fall at His feet. I have deserved\r\ndeath, I should say to Him, but oh Thou great God, good God, indulgent\r\nGod, give me back her whom I love!"\r\n\r\nBy this time the night was far advanced. After an hour or two of\r\npeaceful sleep, Fouqu\xc3\xa9 arrived.\r\n\r\nJulien felt strongly resolute, like a man who sees to the bottom of his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\n\r\n"I cannot play such a trick on that poor abb\xc3\xa9 Chas-Bernard, as to\r\nsummon him," he said to Fouqu\xc3\xa9: "it would prevent him from dining for\r\nthree whole days.--But try and find some Jansenist who is a friend of\r\nM. Pirard."\r\n\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 was impatiently waiting for this suggestion. Julien acquitted\r\nhimself becomingly of all the duty a man owes to provincial opinion.\r\nThanks to M. the abb\xc3\xa9 de Frilair, and in spite of his bad choice of a\r\nconfessor, Julien enjoyed in his cell the protection of the priestly\r\ncongregation; with a little more diplomacy he might have managed to\r\nescape. But the bad air of the cell produced its effect, and his\r\nstrength of mind diminished. But this only intensified his happiness at\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s return.\r\n\r\n"My first duty is towards you, my dear," she said as she embraced him;\r\n"I have run away from Verri\xc3\xa8res."\r\n\r\nJulien felt no petty vanity in his relations with her, and told her all\r\nhis weaknesses. She was good and charming to him.\r\n\r\nIn the evening she had scarcely left the prison before she made the\r\npriest, who had clung on to Julien like a veritable prey, go to her\r\naunt\'s: as his only object was to win prestige among the young women\r\nwho belonged to good Besan\xc3\xa7on society, madame de R\xc3\xaanal easily prevailed\r\nupon him to go and perform a novena at the abbey of Bray-le-Haut.\r\n\r\nNo words can do justice to the madness and extravagance of Julien\'s\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nBy means of gold, and by using and abusing the influence of her aunt,\r\nwho was devout, rich and well-known, madame de R\xc3\xaanal managed to see him\r\ntwice a day.\r\n\r\nAt this news, Mathilde\'s jealousy reached a pitch of positive madness.\r\nM. de Frilair had confessed to her that all his influence did not go\r\nso far as to admit of flouting the conventions by allowing her to\r\nsee her sweetheart more than once every day. Mathilde had madame de\r\nR\xc3\xaanal followed so as to know the smallest thing she did. M. de Frilair\r\nexhausted all the resources of an extremely clever intellect in order\r\nto prove to her that Julien was unworthy of her.\r\n\r\nPlunged though she was in all these torments, she only loved him the\r\nmore, and made a horrible scene nearly every day.\r\n\r\nJulien wished, with all his might, to behave to the very end like an\r\nhonourable man towards this poor young girl whom he had so strangely\r\ncompromised, but the reckless love which he felt for madame de R\xc3\xaanal\r\nswept him away at every single minute. When he could not manage to\r\npersuade Mathilde of the innocence of her rival\'s visits by all his\r\nthin excuses, he would say to himself: "at any rate the end of the\r\ndrama ought to be quite near. The very fact of not being able to lie\r\nbetter will be an excuse for me."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de La Mole learnt of the death of the marquis de\r\nCroisenois. The rich M. de Thaler had indulged in some unpleasant\r\nremarks concerning Mathilde\'s disappearance: M. de Croisenois went\r\nand asked him to recant them: M. de Thaler showed him some anonymous\r\nletters which had been sent to him, and which were full of details so\r\nartfully put together that the poor marquis could not help catching a\r\nglimpse of the truth.\r\n\r\nM. de Thaler indulged in some jests which were devoid of all taste.\r\nMaddened by anger and unhappiness, M. de Croisenois demanded such\r\nunqualified satisfaction, that the millionaire preferred to fight a\r\nduel. Stupidity triumphed, and one of the most lovable of men met with\r\nhis death before he was twenty-four.\r\n\r\nThis death produced a strange and morbid impression on Julien\'s\r\ndemoralised soul.\r\n\r\n"Poor Croisenois," he said to Mathilde, "really behaved very reasonably\r\nand very honourably towards us; he had ample ground for hating me and\r\npicking a quarrel with me, by reason of your indiscretion in your\r\nmother\'s salon; for the hatred which follows on contempt is usually\r\nfrenzied."\r\n\r\nM. de Croisenois\' death changed all Julien\'s ideas concerning\r\nMathilde\'s future. He spent several days in proving to her that she\r\nought to accept the hand of M. de Luz. "He is a nervous man, not too\r\nmuch of a Jesuit, and will doubtless be a candidate," he said to her.\r\n"He has a more sinister and persevering ambition than poor Croisenois,\r\nand as there has never been a dukedom in his family, he will be only\r\ntoo glad to marry Julien Sorel\'s widow."\r\n\r\n"A widow, though, who scorns the grand passions," answered Mathilde\r\ncoldly, "for she has lived long enough to see her lover prefer to\r\nher after six months another woman who was the origin of all their\r\nunhappiness."\r\n\r\n"You are unjust! Madame de R\xc3\xaanal\'s visits will furnish my advocate\r\nat Paris, who is endeavouring to procure my pardon, with the subject\r\nmatter for some sensational phrases; he will depict the murderer\r\nhonoured by the attention of his victim. That may produce an\r\nimpression, and perhaps some day or other, you will see me provide the\r\nplot of some melodrama or other, etc., etc."\r\n\r\nA furious and impotent jealousy, a prolonged and hopeless unhappiness\r\n(for even supposing Julien was saved, how was she to win back his\r\nheart?), coupled with her shame and anguish at loving this unfaithful\r\nlover more than ever had plunged mademoiselle de la Mole into a gloomy\r\nsilence, from which all the careful assiduity of M. de Frilair was as\r\nlittle able to draw her as the rugged frankness of Fouqu\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nAs for Julien, except in those moments which were taken up by\r\nMathilde\'s presence, he lived on love with scarcely a thought for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n"In former days," Julien said to her, "when I might have been so happy,\r\nduring our walks in the wood of Vergy, a frenzied ambition swept my\r\nsoul into the realms of imagination. Instead of pressing to my heart\r\nthat charming arm which is so near my lips, the thoughts of my future\r\ntook me away from you; I was engaged in countless combats which I\r\nshould have to sustain in order to lay the foundations of a colossal\r\nfortune. No, I should have died without knowing what happiness was if\r\nyou had not come to see me in this prison."\r\n\r\nTwo episodes ruffled this tranquil life. Julien\'s confessor, Jansenist\r\nthough he was, was not proof against an intrigue of the Jesuits, and\r\nbecame their tool without knowing it.\r\n\r\nHe came to tell him one day that unless he meant to fall into the awful\r\nsin of suicide, he ought to take every possible step to procure his\r\npardon. Consequently, as the clergy have a great deal of influence with\r\nthe minister of Justice at Paris, an easy means presented itself; he\r\nought to become converted with all publicity.\r\n\r\n"With publicity," repeated Julien. "Ha, Ha! I have caught you at it--I\r\nhave caught you as well, my father, playing a part like any missionary."\r\n\r\n"Your youth," replied the Jansenist gravely, "the interesting\r\nappearance which Providence has given you, the still unsolved mystery\r\nof the motive for your crime, the heroic steps which mademoiselle de\r\nla Mole has so freely taken on your behalf, everything, up to the\r\nsurprising affection which your victim manifests towards you, has\r\ncontributed to make you the hero of the young women of Besan\xc3\xa7on.\r\nThey have forgotten everything, even politics, on your account. Your\r\nconversion will reverberate in their hearts and will leave behind it a\r\ndeep impression. You can be of considerable use to religion, and I was\r\nabout to hesitate for the trivial reason that in a similar circumstance\r\nthe Jesuits would follow a similar course. But if I did, even in the\r\none case which has escaped their greedy clutches they would still be\r\nexercising their mischief. The tears which your conversation will\r\ncause to be shed will annul the poisonous effect of ten editions of\r\nVoltaire\'s works."\r\n\r\n"And what will be left for me," answered Julien, coldly, "if I despise\r\nmyself? I have been ambitious; I do not mean to blame myself in any\r\nway. Further, I have acted in accordance with the code of the age. Now\r\nI am living from day to day. But I should make myself very unhappy\r\nif I were to yield to what the locality would regard as a piece of\r\ncowardice...."\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal was responsible for the other episode which affected\r\nJulien in quite another way. Some intriguing woman friend or other had\r\nmanaged to persuade this na\xc3\xafve and timid soul that it was her duty\r\nto leave for St. Cloud, and go and throw herself at the feet of King\r\nCharles X.\r\n\r\nShe had made the sacrifice of separating from Julien, and after\r\na strain as great as that, she no longer thought anything of the\r\nunpleasantness of making an exhibition of herself, though in former\r\ntimes she would have thought that worse than death.\r\n\r\n"I will go to the king. I will confess freely that you are my lover.\r\nThe life of a man, and of a man like Julien, too, ought to prevail over\r\nevery consideration. I will tell him that it was because of jealousy\r\nthat you made an attempt upon my life. There are numerous instances of\r\npoor young people who have been saved in such a case by the clemency of\r\nthe jury or of the king."\r\n\r\n"I will leave off seeing you; I will shut myself up in my prison,"\r\nexclaimed Julien, "and you can be quite certain that if you do not\r\npromise me to take no step which will make a public exhibition of us\r\nboth, I will kill myself in despair the day afterwards. This idea of\r\ngoing to Paris is not your own. Tell me the name of the intriguing\r\nwoman who suggested it to you.\r\n\r\n"Let us be happy during the small number of days of this short life.\r\nLet us hide our existence; my crime was only too self-evident.\r\nMademoiselle de la Mole enjoys all possible influence at Paris. Take\r\nit from me that she has done all that is humanly possible. Here in\r\nthe provinces I have all the men of wealth and prestige against me.\r\nYour conduct will still further aggravate those rich and essentially\r\nmoderate people to whom life comes so easy.... Let us not give the\r\nMaslons, the Valenods, and the thousand other people who are worth more\r\nthan they, anything to laugh about."\r\n\r\nJulien came to find the bad air of the cell unbearable. Fortunately,\r\nnature was rejoicing in a fine sunshine on the day when they announced\r\nto him that he would have to die, and he was in a courageous vein.\r\nHe found walking in the open air as delicious a sensation as the\r\nnavigator, who has been at sea for a long time, finds walking on the\r\nground. "Come on, everything is going all right," he said to himself.\r\n"I am not lacking in courage."\r\n\r\nHis head had never looked so poetical as at that moment when it was on\r\nthe point of falling. The sweet minutes which he had formerly spent in\r\nthe woods of Vergy crowded back upon his mind with extreme force.\r\n\r\nEverything went off simply, decorously, and without any affectation on\r\nhis part.\r\n\r\nTwo days before he had said to Fouqu\xc3\xa9: "I cannot guarantee not to\r\nshow some emotion. This dense, squalid cell gives me fits of fever in\r\nwhich I do not recognise myself, but fear?--no! I shall not be seen to\r\nflinch."\r\n\r\nHe had made his arrangements in advance for Fouqu\xc3\xa9 to take Mathilde and\r\nmadame de R\xc3\xaanal away on the morning of his last day.\r\n\r\n"Drive them away in the same carriage," he had said. "Do you see that\r\nthe post-horses do not leave off galloping. They will either fall into\r\neach other\'s arms, or manifest towards each other a mortal hatred.\r\nIn either case the poor women will have something to distract them a\r\nlittle from their awful grief."\r\n\r\nJulien had made madame de R\xc3\xaanal swear that she would live to look after\r\nMathilde\'s son.\r\n\r\n"Who knows? Perhaps we have still some sensations after our death," he\r\nhad said one day to Fouqu\xc3\xa9. "I should like to rest, for rest is the\r\nright word, in that little grotto in the great mountain which dominates\r\nVerri\xc3\xa8res. Many a time, as I have told you, I have spent the night\r\nalone in that grotto, and as my gaze would plunge far and wide over the\r\nrichest provinces of France, ambition would inflame my heart. In those\r\ndays it was my passion.... Anyway, I hold that grotto dear, and one\r\ncannot dispute that its situation might well arouse the desires of the\r\nphilosopher\'s soul.... Well, you know! those good priests of Besan\xc3\xa7on\r\nwill make money out of everything. If you know how to manage it, they\r\nwill sell you my mortal remains."\r\n\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 succeeded in this melancholy business. He was passing the night\r\nalone in his room by his friend\'s body when, to his great surprise, he\r\nsaw Mathilde come in. A few hours before he had left her ten leagues\r\nfrom Besan\xc3\xa7on. Her face and eyes looked distraught.\r\n\r\n"I want to see him," she said.\r\n\r\nFouqu\xc3\xa9 had not the courage either to speak or get up. He pointed with\r\nhis finger to a big blue cloak on the floor; there was wrapped in it\r\nall that remained of Julien.\r\n\r\nShe threw herself on her knees. The memory of Boniface de la Mole, and\r\nof Marguerite of Navarre gave her, no doubt, a superhuman courage. Her\r\ntrembling hands undid the cloak. Fouqu\xc3\xa9 turned away his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe heard Mathilde walking feverishly about the room. She lit several\r\ncandles. When Fouqu\xc3\xa9 could bring himself to look at her, she had placed\r\nJulien\'s head on a little marble table in front of her, and was kissing\r\nit on the forehead.\r\n\r\nMathilde followed her lover to the tomb which he had chosen. A great\r\nnumber of priests convoyed the bier, and, alone in her draped carriage,\r\nwithout anyone knowing it, she carried on her knees the head of the man\r\nwhom she had loved so much.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived in this way at the most elevated peak of the high\r\nmountains of the Jura, twenty priests celebrated the service of the\r\ndead in the middle of the night in this little grotto, which was\r\nmagnificently illuminated by a countless number of wax candles.\r\nAttracted by this strange and singular ceremony, all the inhabitants\r\nof the little mountain villages which the funeral had passed through,\r\nfollowed it.\r\n\r\nMathilde appeared in their midst in long mourning garments, and had\r\nseveral thousands of five-franc pieces thrown to them at the end of the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nWhen she was left alone with Fouqu\xc3\xa9, she insisted on burying her\r\nlover\'s head with her own hands. Fouqu\xc3\xa9 nearly went mad with grief.\r\n\r\nMathilde took care that this wild grotto should be decorated with\r\nmarble monuments that had been sculpted in Italy at great expense.\r\n\r\nMadame de R\xc3\xaanal kept her promise. She did not try to make any attempt\r\nupon her life; but she died embracing her children, three days after\r\nJulien.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience of the reign of public opinion is that though, of\r\ncourse, it secures liberty, it meddles with what it has nothing to do\r\nwith--private life, for example. Hence the gloominess of America and\r\nEngland. In order to avoid infringing on private life, the author has\r\ninvented a little town--Verri\xc3\xa8res, and when he had need of a bishop,\r\na jury, an assize court, he placed all this in Besan\xc3\xa7on, where he has\r\nnever been.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    INTRODUCTION\r\n    CHAPTER I        A SMALL TOWN\r\n    CHAPTER II       A MAYOR\r\n    CHAPTER III      THE POOR FUND\r\n    CHAPTER IV       A FATHER AND A SON\r\n    CHAPTER V        A NEGOTIATION\r\n    CHAPTER VI       ENNUI\r\n    CHAPTER VII      THE ELECTIVE AFFINITIES\r\n    CHAPTER VIII     LITTLE EPISODES\r\n    CHAPTER IX       AN EVENING IN THE COUNTRY\r\n    CHAPTER X        A GREAT HEART AND A SMALL FORTUNE\r\n    CHAPTER XI       AN EVENING\r\n    CHAPTER XII      A JOURNEY\r\n    CHAPTER XIII     THE OPEN WORK STOCKINGS\r\n    CHAPTER XIV      THE ENGLISH SCISSORS\r\n    CHAPTER XV       THE COCK\'S SONG\r\n    CHAPTER XVI      THE DAY AFTER\r\n    CHAPTER XVII     THE FIRST DEPUTY\r\n    CHAPTER XVIII    A KING AT VERRI\xc3\x88RES\r\n    CHAPTER XIX      THINKING PRODUCES SUFFERING\r\n    CHAPTER XX       ANONYMOUS LETTERS\r\n    CHAPTER XXI      DIALOGUE WITH A MASTER\r\n    CHAPTER XXII     MANNERS OF PROCEDURE IN 1830\r\n    CHAPTER XXIII    SORROWS OF AN OFFICIAL\r\n    CHAPTER XXIV     A CAPITAL\r\n    CHAPTER XXV      THE SEMINARY\r\n    CHAPTER XXVI     THE WORLD, OR WHAT THE RICH LACK\r\n    CHAPTER XXVII    FIRST EXPERIENCE OF LIFE\r\n    CHAPTER XXVIII   A PROCESSION\r\n    CHAPTER XXIX     THE FIRST PROMOTION\r\n    CHAPTER XXX      AN AMBITIOUS MAN\r\n    CHAPTER XXXI     THE PLEASURES OF THE COUNTRY\r\n    CHAPTER XXXII    ENTRY INTO SOCIETY\r\n    CHAPTER XXXIII   THE FIRST STEPS\r\n    CHAPTER XXXIV    THE H\xc3\x94TEL DE LA MOLE\r\n    CHAPTER XXXV     SENSIBILITY AND A GREAT PIOUS LADY\r\n    CHAPTER XXXVI    PRONUNCIATION\r\n    CHAPTER XXXVII   AN ATTACK OF GOUT\r\n    CHAPTER XXXVIII  WHAT IS THE DECORATION WHICH CONFERS DISTINCTION?\r\n    CHAPTER XXXIX    HE BALL\r\n    CHAPTER XL       QUEEN MARGUERITE\r\n    CHAPTER XLI      A YOUNG GIRL\'S DOMINION\r\n    CHAPTER XLII     IS HE A DANTON?\r\n    CHAPTER XLIII    A PLOT\r\n    CHAPTER XLIV     A YOUNG GIRL\'S THOUGHTS\r\n    CHAPTER XLV      IS IT A PLOT?\r\n    CHAPTER XLVI     ONE O\'CLOCK IN THE MORNING\r\n    CHAPTER XLVII    AN OLD SWORD\r\n    CHAPTER XLVIII   CRUEL MOMENTS\r\n    CHAPTER XLIX     THE OPERA BOUFFE\r\n    CHAPTER L        THE JAPANESE VASE\r\n    CHAPTER LI       THE SECRET NOTE\r\n    CHAPTER LII      THE DISCUSSION\r\n    CHAPTER LIII     THE CLERGY, THE FORESTS, LIBERTY\r\n    CHAPTER LIV      STRASBOURG\r\n    CHAPTER LV       THE MINISTRY OF VIRTUE\r\n    CHAPTER LVI      MORAL LOVE\r\n    CHAPTER LVII     THE FINEST PLACES IN THE CHURCH\r\n    CHAPTER LVIII    MANON LESCAUT\r\n    CHAPTER LIX      ENNUI\r\n    CHAPTER LX       A BOX AT THE BOUFFES\r\n    CHAPTER LXI      FRIGHTEN HER\r\n    CHAPTER LXII     THE TIGER\r\n    CHAPTER LXIII    THE HELL OF WEAKNESS\r\n    CHAPTER LXIV     A MAN OF INTELLECT\r\n    CHAPTER LXV      A STORM\r\n    CHAPTER LXVI     SAD DETAILS\r\n    CHAPTER LXVII    A TURRET\r\n    CHAPTER LXVIII   A POWERFUL MAN\r\n    CHAPTER LXIX     THE INTRIGUE\r\n    CHAPTER LXX      TRANQUILITY\r\n    CHAPTER LXXI     THE TRIAL\r\n    CHAPTER LXXII\r\n    CHAPTER LXXIII\r\n    CHAPTER LXXIV\r\n    CHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RED AND THE BLACK ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
