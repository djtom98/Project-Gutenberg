THACKERAY.\r\n\r\nLONDON, October 18, 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nTHE ESMONDS OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estate of Castlewood, in Virginia, which was given to our ancestors\r\nby King Charles the First, as some return for the sacrifices made in\r\nhis Majesty's cause by the Esmond family, lies in Westmoreland county,\r\nbetween the rivers Potomac and Rappahannock, and was once as great as\r\nan English Principality, though in the early times its revenues were\r\nbut small. Indeed, for near eighty years after our forefathers possessed\r\nthem, our plantations were in the hands of factors, who enriched\r\nthemselves one after another, though a few scores of hogsheads of\r\ntobacco were all the produce that, for long after the Restoration, our\r\nfamily received from their Virginian estates.\r\n\r\nMy dear and honored father, Colonel Henry Esmond, whose history, written\r\nby himself, is contained in the accompanying volume, came to Virginia\r\nin the year 1718, built his house of Castlewood, and here permanently\r\nsettled. After a long stormy life in England, he passed the remainder\r\nof his many years in peace and honor in this country; how beloved and\r\nrespected by all his fellow-citizens, how inexpressibly dear to his\r\nfamily, I need not say. His whole life was a benefit to all who were\r\nconnected with him. He gave the best example, the best advice, the\r\nmost bounteous hospitality to his friends; the tenderest care to\r\nhis dependants; and bestowed on those of his immediate family such a\r\nblessing of fatherly love and protection as can never be thought of,\r\nby us, at least, without veneration and thankfulness; and my sons'\r\nchildren, whether established here in our Republic, or at home in\r\nthe always beloved mother country, from which our late quarrel hath\r\nseparated us, may surely be proud to be descended from one who in all\r\nways was so truly noble.\r\n\r\nMy dear mother died in 1736, soon after our return from England, whither\r\nmy parents took me for my education; and where I made the acquaintance\r\nof Mr. Warrington, whom my children never saw. When it pleased heaven,\r\nin the bloom of his youth, and after but a few months of a most happy\r\nunion, to remove him from me, I owed my recovery from the grief which\r\nthat calamity caused me, mainly to my dearest father's tenderness, and\r\nthen to the blessing vouchsafed to me in the birth of my two beloved\r\nboys. I know the fatal differences which separated them in politics\r\nnever disunited their hearts; and as I can love them both, whether\r\nwearing the King's colors or the Republic's, I am sure that they love\r\nme and one another, and him above all, my father and theirs, the dearest\r\nfriend of their childhood, the noble gentleman who bred them from their\r\ninfancy in the practice and knowledge of Truth, and Love and Honor.\r\n\r\nMy children will never forget the appearance and figure of their revered\r\ngrandfather; and I wish I possessed the art of drawing (which my papa\r\nhad in perfection), so that I could leave to our descendants a portrait\r\nof one who was so good and so respected. My father was of a dark\r\ncomplexion, with a very great forehead and dark hazel eyes, overhung by\r\neyebrows which remained black long after his hair was white. His nose\r\nwas aquiline, his smile extraordinary sweet. How well I remember it, and\r\nhow little any description I can write can recall his image! He was of\r\nrather low stature, not being above five feet seven inches in height; he\r\nused to laugh at my sons, whom he called his crutches, and say they\r\nwere grown too tall for him to lean upon. But small as he was, he had\r\na perfect grace and majesty of deportment, such as I have never seen in\r\nthis country, except perhaps in our friend Mr. Washington, and commanded\r\nrespect wherever he appeared.\r\n\r\nIn all bodily exercises he excelled, and showed an extraordinary\r\nquickness and agility. Of fencing he was especially fond, and made my\r\ntwo boys proficient in that art; so much so, that when the French came\r\nto this country with Monsieur Rochambeau, not one of his officers was\r\nsuperior to my Henry, and he was not the equal of my poor George,\r\nwho had taken the King's side in our lamentable but glorious war of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nNeither my father nor my mother ever wore powder in their hair; both\r\ntheir heads were as white as silver, as I can remember them. My dear\r\nmother possessed to the last an extraordinary brightness and freshness\r\nof complexion; nor would people believe that she did not wear rouge. At\r\nsixty years of age she still looked young, and was quite agile. It was\r\nnot until after that dreadful siege of our house by the Indians, which\r\nleft me a widow ere I was a mother, that my dear mother's health broke.\r\nShe never recovered her terror and anxiety of those days which ended so\r\nfatally for me, then a bride scarce six months married, and died in my\r\nfather's arms ere my own year of widowhood was over.\r\n\r\nFrom that day, until the last of his dear and honored life, it was\r\nmy delight and consolation to remain with him as his comforter and\r\ncompanion; and from those little notes which my mother hath made here\r\nand there in the volume in which my father describes his adventures\r\nin Europe, I can well understand the extreme devotion with which she\r\nregarded him--a devotion so passionate and exclusive as to prevent her,\r\nI think, from loving any other person except with an inferior regard;\r\nher whole thoughts being centred on this one object of affection and\r\nworship. I know that, before her, my dear father did not show the love\r\nwhich he had for his daughter; and in her last and most sacred moments,\r\nthis dear and tender parent owned to me her repentance that she had\r\nnot loved me enough: her jealousy even that my father should give his\r\naffection to any but herself: and in the most fond and beautiful words\r\nof affection and admonition, she bade me never to leave him, and to\r\nsupply the place which she was quitting. With a clear conscience, and a\r\nheart inexpressibly thankful, I think I can say that I fulfilled those\r\ndying commands, and that until his last hour my dearest father never had\r\nto complain that his daughter's love and fidelity failed him.\r\n\r\nAnd it is since I knew him entirely--for during my mother's life he\r\nnever quite opened himself to me--since I knew the value and splendor of\r\nthat affection which he bestowed upon me, that I have come to understand\r\nand pardon what, I own, used to anger me in my mother's lifetime, her\r\njealousy respecting her husband's love. 'Twas a gift so precious, that\r\nno wonder she who had it was for keeping it all, and could part with\r\nnone of it, even to her daughter.\r\n\r\nThough I never heard my father use a rough word, 'twas extraordinary\r\nwith how much awe his people regarded him; and the servants on our\r\nplantation, both those assigned from England and the purchased negroes,\r\nobeyed him with an eagerness such as the most severe taskmasters round\r\nabout us could never get from their people. He was never familiar,\r\nthough perfectly simple and natural; he was the same with the meanest\r\nman as with the greatest, and as courteous to a black slave-girl as to\r\nthe Governor's wife. No one ever thought of taking a liberty with him\r\n(except once a tipsy gentleman from York, and I am bound to own that\r\nmy papa never forgave him): he set the humblest people at once on their\r\nease with him, and brought down the most arrogant by a grave satiric\r\nway, which made persons exceedingly afraid of him. His courtesy was not\r\nput on like a Sunday suit, and laid by when the company went away; it\r\nwas always the same; as he was always dressed the same, whether for a\r\ndinner by ourselves or for a great entertainment. They say he liked\r\nto be the first in his company; but what company was there in which\r\nhe would not be first? When I went to Europe for my education, and we\r\npassed a winter at London with my half-brother, my Lord Castlewood and\r\nhis second lady, I saw at her Majesty's Court some of the most famous\r\ngentlemen of those days; and I thought to myself none of these are\r\nbetter than my papa; and the famous Lord Bolingbroke, who came to us\r\nfrom Dawley, said as much, and that the men of that time were not like\r\nthose of his youth:--\xe2\x80\x9cWere your father, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto go into the\r\nwoods, the Indians would elect him Sachem;\xe2\x80\x9d and his lordship was pleased\r\nto call me Pocahontas.\r\n\r\nI did not see our other relative, Bishop Tusher's lady, of whom so much\r\nis said in my papa's memoirs--although my mamma went to visit her in\r\nthe country. I have no pride (as I showed by complying with my mother's\r\nrequest, and marrying a gentleman who was but the younger son of a\r\nSuffolk Baronet), yet I own to A DECENT RESPECT for my name, and wonder\r\nhow one who ever bore it, should change it for that of Mrs. THOMAS\r\nTUSHER. I pass over as odious and unworthy of credit those reports\r\n(which I heard in Europe and was then too young to understand), how this\r\nperson, having LEFT HER FAMILY and fled to Paris, out of jealousy of\r\nthe Pretender betrayed his secrets to my Lord Stair, King George's\r\nAmbassador, and nearly caused the Prince's death there; how she came to\r\nEngland and married this Mr. Tusher, and became a great favorite of\r\nKing George the Second, by whom Mr. Tusher was made a Dean, and then a\r\nBishop. I did not see the lady, who chose to remain AT HER PALACE all\r\nthe time we were in London; but after visiting her, my poor mamma said\r\nshe had lost all her good looks, and warned me not to set too much\r\nstore by any such gifts which nature had bestowed upon me. She grew\r\nexceedingly stout; and I remember my brother's wife, Lady Castlewood,\r\nsaying--\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder she became a favorite, for the King likes them old\r\nand ugly, as his father did before him.\xe2\x80\x9d On which papa said--\xe2\x80\x9cAll women\r\nwere alike; that there was never one so beautiful as that one; and that\r\nwe could forgive her everything but her beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d And hereupon my mamma\r\nlooked vexed, and my Lord Castlewood began to laugh; and I, of course,\r\nbeing a young creature, could not understand what was the subject of\r\ntheir conversation.\r\n\r\nAfter the circumstances narrated in the third book of these Memoirs, my\r\nfather and mother both went abroad, being advised by their friends to\r\nleave the country in consequence of the transactions which are recounted\r\nat the close of the volume of the Memoirs. But my brother, hearing how\r\nthe FUTURE BISHOP'S LADY had quitted Castlewood and joined the Pretender\r\nat Paris, pursued him, and would have killed him, Prince as he was, had\r\nnot the Prince managed to make his escape. On his expedition to Scotland\r\ndirectly after, Castlewood was so enraged against him that he asked\r\nleave to serve as a volunteer, and join the Duke of Argyle's army\r\nin Scotland, which the Pretender never had the courage to face; and\r\nthenceforth my Lord was quite reconciled to the present reigning family,\r\nfrom whom he hath even received promotion.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tusher was by this time as angry against the Pretender as any of\r\nher relations could be, and used to boast, as I have heard, that she\r\nnot only brought back my Lord to the Church of England, but procured\r\nthe English peerage for him, which the JUNIOR BRANCH of our family at\r\npresent enjoys. She was a great friend of Sir Robert Walpole, and would\r\nnot rest until her husband slept at Lambeth, my papa used laughing to\r\nsay. However, the Bishop died of apoplexy suddenly, and his wife erected\r\na great monument over him; and the pair sleep under that stone, with\r\na canopy of marble clouds and angels above them--the first Mrs. Tusher\r\nlying sixty miles off at Castlewood.\r\n\r\nBut my papa's genius and education are both greater than any a woman can\r\nbe expected to have, and his adventures in Europe far more exciting than\r\nhis life in this country, which was passed in the tranquil offices of\r\nlove and duty; and I shall say no more by way of introduction to his\r\nMemoirs, nor keep my children from the perusal of a story which is much\r\nmore interesting than that of their affectionate old mother,\r\n\r\nRACHEL ESMOND WARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nCASTLEWOOD, VIRGINIA,\r\n\r\nNovember 3, 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY YOUTH OF HENRY ESMOND, UP TO THE TIME OF HIS LEAVING TRINITY\r\nCOLLEGE, IN CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\nI.

'Twas thought the dignity of the Tragic Muse required these\r\nappurtenances, and that she was not to move except to a measure and\r\ncadence. So Queen Medea slew her children to a slow music: and King\r\nAgamemnon perished in a dying fall (to use Mr. Dryden's words): the\r\nChorus standing by in a set attitude, and rhythmically and decorously\r\nbewailing the fates of those great crowned persons. The Muse of History\r\nhath encumbered herself with ceremony as well as her Sister of the\r\nTheatre. She too wears the mask and the cothurnus, and speaks to\r\nmeasure. She too, in our age, busies herself with the affairs only of\r\nkings; waiting on them obsequiously and stately, as if she were but a\r\nmistress of court ceremonies, and had nothing to do with the registering\r\nof the affairs of the common people. I have seen in his very old age and\r\ndecrepitude the old French King Lewis the Fourteenth, the type and\r\nmodel of kinghood--who never moved but to measure, who lived and died\r\naccording to the laws of his Court-marshal, persisting in enacting\r\nthrough life the part of Hero; and, divested of poetry, this was but a\r\nlittle wrinkled old man, pock-marked, and with a great periwig and red\r\nheels to make him look tall--a hero for a book if you like, or for a\r\nbrass statue or a painted ceiling, a god in a Roman shape, but what\r\nmore than a man for Madame Maintenon, or the barber who shaved him, or\r\nMonsieur Fagon, his surgeon? I wonder shall History ever pull off her\r\nperiwig and cease to be court-ridden? Shall we see something of France\r\nand England besides Versailles and Windsor? I saw Queen Anne at the\r\nlatter place tearing down the Park slopes, after her stag-hounds, and\r\ndriving her one-horse chaise--a hot, red-faced woman, not in the least\r\nresembling that statue of her which turns its stone back upon St.\r\nPaul's, and faces the coaches struggling up Ludgate Hill. She was\r\nneither better bred nor wiser than you and me, though we knelt to hand\r\nher a letter or a wash-hand basin. Why shall History go on kneeling to\r\nthe end of time? I am for having her rise up off her knees, and take a\r\nnatural posture: not to be for ever performing cringes and congees\r\nlike a court-chamberlain, and shuffling backwards out of doors in the\r\npresence of the sovereign. In a word, I would have History familiar\r\nrather than heroic: and think that Mr. Hogarth and Mr. Fielding will\r\ngive our children a much better idea of the manners of the present\r\nage in England, than the Court Gazette and the newspapers which we get\r\nthence.\r\n\r\nThere was a German officer of Webb's, with whom we used to joke, and of\r\nwhom a story (whereof I myself was the author) was got to be believed in\r\nthe army, that he was eldest son of the hereditary Grand Bootjack of the\r\nEmpire, and the heir to that honor of which his ancestors had been very\r\nproud, having been kicked for twenty generations by one imperial foot,\r\nas they drew the boot from the other. I have heard that the old\r\nLord Castlewood, of part of whose family these present volumes are a\r\nchronicle, though he came of quite as good blood as the Stuarts whom\r\nhe served (and who as regards mere lineage are no better than a dozen\r\nEnglish and Scottish houses I could name), was prouder of his post about\r\nthe Court than of his ancestral honors, and valued his dignity (as Lord\r\nof the Butteries and Groom of the King's Posset) so highly, that he\r\ncheerfully ruined himself for the thankless and thriftless race who\r\nbestowed it. He pawned his plate for King Charles the First, mortgaged\r\nhis property for the same cause, and lost the greater part of it by\r\nfines and sequestration: stood a siege of his castle by Ireton,\r\nwhere his brother Thomas capitulated (afterward making terms with the\r\nCommonwealth, for which the elder brother never forgave him), and\r\nwhere his second brother Edward, who had embraced the ecclesiastical\r\nprofession, was slain on Castlewood Tower, being engaged there both as\r\npreacher and artilleryman. This resolute old loyalist, who was with the\r\nKing whilst his house was thus being battered down, escaped abroad with\r\nhis only son, then a boy, to return and take a part in Worcester fight.\r\nOn that fatal field Eustace Esmond was killed, and Castlewood fled from\r\nit once more into exile, and henceforward, and after the Restoration,\r\nnever was away from the Court of the monarch (for whose return we offer\r\nthanks in the Prayer-Book) who sold his country and who took bribes of\r\nthe French king.\r\n\r\nWhat spectacle is more august than that of a great king in exile? Who is\r\nmore worthy of respect than a brave man in misfortune? Mr. Addison has\r\npainted such a figure in his noble piece of Cato. But suppose fugitive\r\nCato fuddling himself at a tavern with a wench on each knee, a dozen\r\nfaithful and tipsy companions of defeat, and a landlord calling out\r\nfor his bill; and the dignity of misfortune is straightway lost. The\r\nHistorical Muse turns away shamefaced from the vulgar scene, and closes\r\nthe door--on which the exile's unpaid drink is scored up--upon him and\r\nhis pots and his pipes, and the tavern-chorus which he and his friends\r\nare singing. Such a man as Charles should have had an Ostade or Mieris\r\nto paint him. Your Knellers and Le Bruns only deal in clumsy and\r\nimpossible allegories: and it hath always seemed to me blasphemy to\r\nclaim Olympus for such a wine-drabbled divinity as that.\r\n\r\nAbout the King's follower, the Viscount Castlewood--orphan of his son,\r\nruined by his fidelity, bearing many wounds and marks of bravery,\r\nold and in exile--his kinsmen I suppose should be silent; nor if this\r\npatriarch fell down in his cups, call fie upon him, and fetch passers-by\r\nto laugh at his red face and white hairs. What! does a stream rush out\r\nof a mountain free and pure, to roll through fair pastures, to feed and\r\nthrow out bright tributaries, and to end in a village gutter? Lives that\r\nhave noble commencements have often no better endings; it is not without\r\na kind of awe and reverence that an observer should speculate upon such\r\ncareers as he traces the course of them. I have seen too much of success\r\nin life to take off my hat and huzzah to it as it passes in its gilt\r\ncoach: and would do my little part with my neighbors on foot, that they\r\nshould not gape with too much wonder, nor applaud too loudly. Is it the\r\nLord Mayor going in state to mince-pies and the Mansion House? Is it\r\npoor Jack of Newgate's procession, with the sheriff and javelin-men,\r\nconducting him on his last journey to Tyburn? I look into my heart\r\nand think that I sin as good as my Lord Mayor, and know I am as bad as\r\nTyburn Jack. Give me a chain and red gown and a pudding before me, and\r\nI could play the part of Alderman very well, and sentence Jack after\r\ndinner. Starve me, keep me from books and honest people, educate me to\r\nlove dice, gin, and pleasure, and put me on Hounslow Heath, with a purse\r\nbefore me, and I will take it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall be deservedly hanged,\xe2\x80\x9d say\r\nyou, wishing to put an end to this prosing. I don't say No. I can't but\r\naccept the world as I find it, including a rope's end, as long as it is\r\nin fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY OF ESMOND OF CASTLEWOOD HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Francis, fourth Viscount Castlewood, came to his title, and\r\npresently after to take possession of his house of Castlewood, county\r\nHants, in the year 1691, almost the only tenant of the place besides\r\nthe domestics was a lad of twelve years of age, of whom no one seemed to\r\ntake any note until my Lady Viscountess lighted upon him, going over the\r\nhouse with the housekeeper on the day of her arrival. The boy was in the\r\nroom known as the Book-room, or Yellow Gallery, where the portraits of\r\nthe family used to hang, that fine piece among others of Sir Antonio Van\r\nDyck of George, second Viscount, and that by Mr. Dobson of my lord the\r\nthird Viscount, just deceased, which it seems his lady and widow did not\r\nthink fit to carry away, when she sent for and carried off to her house\r\nat Chelsey, near to London, the picture of herself by Sir Peter Lely, in\r\nwhich her ladyship was represented as a huntress of Diana's court.\r\n\r\nThe new and fair lady of Castlewood found the sad, lonely, little\r\noccupant of this gallery busy over his great book, which he laid down\r\nwhen he was aware that a stranger was at hand. And, knowing who that\r\nperson must be, the lad stood up and bowed before her, performing a shy\r\nobeisance to the mistress of his house.\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand--indeed when was it that that hand would\r\nnot stretch out to do an act of kindness, or to protect grief and\r\nill-fortune? \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is our kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x9cand what is your name,\r\nkinsman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Henry Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lad, looking up at her in a sort\r\nof delight and wonder, for she had come upon him as a Dea certe, and\r\nappeared the most charming object he had ever looked on. Her golden hair\r\nwas shining in the gold of the sun; her complexion was of a dazzling\r\nbloom; her lips smiling, and her eyes beaming with a kindness which made\r\nHarry Esmond's heart to beat with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name is Henry Esmond, sure enough, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Worksop,\r\nthe housekeeper (an old tyrant whom Henry Esmond plagued more than he\r\nhated), and the old gentlewoman looked significantly towards the late\r\nlord's picture, as it now is in the family, noble and severe-looking,\r\nwith his hand on his sword, and his order on his cloak, which he had\r\nfrom the Emperor during the war on the Danube against the Turk.\r\n\r\nSeeing the great and undeniable likeness between this portrait and the\r\nlad, the new Viscountess, who had still hold of the boy's hand as she\r\nlooked at the picture, blushed and dropped the hand quickly, and walked\r\ndown the gallery, followed by Mrs. Worksop.\r\n\r\nWhen the lady came back, Harry Esmond stood exactly in the same spot,\r\nand with his hand as it had fallen when he dropped it on his black coat.\r\n\r\nHer heart melted, I suppose (indeed she hath since owned as much), at\r\nthe notion that she should do anything unkind to any mortal, great or\r\nsmall; for, when she returned, she had sent away the housekeeper upon an\r\nerrand by the door at the farther end of the gallery; and, coming back\r\nto the lad, with a look of infinite pity and tenderness in her eyes, she\r\ntook his hand again, placing her other fair hand on his head, and saying\r\nsome words to him, which were so kind, and said in a voice so sweet,\r\nthat the boy, who had never looked upon so much beauty before, felt as\r\nif the touch of a superior being or angel smote him down to the ground,\r\nand kissed the fair protecting hand as he knelt on one knee. To the very\r\nlast hour of his life, Esmond remembered the lady as she then spoke and\r\nlooked, the rings on her fair hands, the very scent of her robe, the\r\nbeam of her eyes lighting up with surprise and kindness, her lips\r\nblooming in a smile, the sun making a golden halo round her hair.\r\n\r\nAs the boy was yet in this attitude of humility, enters behind him a\r\nportly gentleman, with a little girl of four years old in his hand. The\r\ngentleman burst into a great laugh at the lady and her adorer, with\r\nhis little queer figure, his sallow face, and long black hair. The lady\r\nblushed, and seemed to deprecate his ridicule by a look of appeal to her\r\nhusband, for it was my Lord Viscount who now arrived, and whom the lad\r\nknew, having once before seen him in the late lord's lifetime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is the little priest\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, looking down at the lad;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwelcome, kinsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is saying his prayers to mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d says the little girl, who came up\r\nto her papa's knees; and my lord burst out into another great laugh at\r\nthis, and kinsman Henry looked very silly. He invented a half-dozen of\r\nspeeches in reply, but 'twas months afterwards when he thought of this\r\nadventure: as it was, he had never a word in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe pauvre enfant, il n'a que nous,\xe2\x80\x9d says the lady, looking to her lord;\r\nand the boy, who understood her, though doubtless she thought otherwise,\r\nthanked her with all his heart for her kind speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he shan't want for friends here,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord in a kind voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall he, little Trix?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little girl, whose name was Beatrix, and whom her papa called by\r\nthis diminutive, looked at Henry Esmond solemnly, with a pair of large\r\neyes, and then a smile shone over her face, which was as beautiful as\r\nthat of a cherub, and she came up and put out a little hand to him. A\r\nkeen and delightful pang of gratitude, happiness, affection, filled the\r\norphan child's heart, as he received from the protectors, whom heaven\r\nhad sent to him, these touching words and tokens of friendliness and\r\nkindness. But an hour since, he had felt quite alone in the world: when\r\nhe heard the great peal of bells from Castlewood church ringing that\r\nmorning to welcome the arrival of the new lord and lady, it had rung\r\nonly terror and anxiety to him, for he knew not how the new owner would\r\ndeal with him; and those to whom he formerly looked for protection were\r\nforgotten or dead. Pride and doubt too had kept him within-doors, when\r\nthe Vicar and the people of the village, and the servants of the house,\r\nhad gone out to welcome my Lord Castlewood--for Henry Esmond was no\r\nservant, though a dependant; no relative, though he bore the name and\r\ninherited the blood of the house; and in the midst of the noise and\r\nacclamations attending the arrival of the new lord (for whom, you may\r\nbe sure, a feast was got ready, and guns were fired, and tenants and\r\ndomestics huzzahed when his carriage approached and rolled into the\r\ncourt-yard of the hall), no one ever took any notice of young Henry\r\nEsmond, who sat unobserved and alone in the Book-room, until the\r\nafternoon of that day, when his new friends found him.\r\n\r\nWhen my lord and lady were going away thence, the little girl, still\r\nholding her kinsman by the hand, bade him to come too. \xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt always\r\nforsake an old friend for a new one, Trix,\xe2\x80\x9d says her father to her\r\ngood-naturedly; and went into the gallery, giving an arm to his lady.\r\nThey passed thence through the music-gallery, long since dismantled, and\r\nQueen Elizabeth's Rooms, in the clock-tower, and out into the terrace,\r\nwhere was a fine prospect of sunset and the great darkling woods with\r\na cloud of rooks returning; and the plain and river with Castlewood\r\nvillage beyond, and purple hills beautiful to look at--and the little\r\nheir of Castlewood, a child of two years old, was already here on the\r\nterrace in his nurse's arms, from whom he ran across the grass instantly\r\nhe perceived his mother, and came to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou canst not be happy here,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, looking round at the\r\nscene, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art hard to please, Rachel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy where you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we were happiest of all at\r\nWalcote Forest.\xe2\x80\x9d Then my lord began to describe what was before them to\r\nhis wife, and what indeed little Harry knew better than he--viz., the\r\nhistory of the house: how by yonder gate the page ran away with the\r\nheiress of Castlewood, by which the estate came into the present family;\r\nhow the Roundheads attacked the clock-tower, which my lord's father was\r\nslain in defending. \xe2\x80\x9cI was but two years old then,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut take\r\nforty-six from ninety, and how old shall I be, kinsman Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty,\xe2\x80\x9d says his wife, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal too old for you, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d answers my lord, looking fondly\r\ndown at her. Indeed she seemed to be a girl, and was at that time scarce\r\ntwenty years old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Frank, I will do anything to please you,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\npromise you I will grow older every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn't call papa, Frank; you must call papa my lord now,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nMiss Beatrix, with a toss of her little head; at which the mother\r\nsmiled, and the good-natured father laughed, and the little trotting boy\r\nlaughed, not knowing why--but because he was happy, no doubt--as every\r\none seemed to be there. How those trivial incidents and words, the\r\nlandscape and sunshine, and the group of people smiling and talking,\r\nremain fixed on the memory!\r\n\r\nAs the sun was setting, the little heir was sent in the arms of his\r\nnurse to bed, whither he went howling; but little Trix was promised to\r\nsit to supper that night--\xe2\x80\x9cand you will come too, kinsman, won't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said.\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond blushed: \xe2\x80\x9cI--I have supper with Mrs. Worksop,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n it,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, \xe2\x80\x9cthou shalt sup with us, Harry, to-night!\r\nShan't refuse a lady, shall he, Trix?\xe2\x80\x9d--and they all wondered at Harry's\r\nperformance as a trencher-man, in which character the poor boy acquitted\r\nhimself very remarkably; for the truth is he had had no dinner, nobody\r\nthinking of him in the bustle which the house was in, during the\r\npreparations antecedent to the new lord's arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo dinner! poor dear child!\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, heaping up his plate with\r\nmeat, and my lord, filling a bumper for him, bade him call a health; on\r\nwhich Master Harry, crying \xe2\x80\x9cThe King,\xe2\x80\x9d tossed off the wine. My lord was\r\nready to drink that, and most other toasts: indeed only too ready. He\r\nwould not hear of Doctor Tusher (the Vicar of Castlewood, who came to\r\nsupper) going away when the sweetmeats were brought: he had not had a\r\nchaplain long enough, he said, to be tired of him: so his reverence kept\r\nmy lord company for some hours over a pipe and a punch-bowl; and went\r\naway home with rather a reeling gait, and declaring a dozen of times,\r\nthat his lordship's affability surpassed every kindness he had ever had\r\nfrom his lordship's gracious family.\r\n\r\nAs for young Esmond, when he got to his little chamber, it was with a\r\nheart full of surprise and gratitude towards the new friends whom this\r\nhappy day had brought him. He was up and watching long before the house\r\nwas astir, longing to see that fair lady and her children--that kind\r\nprotector and patron: and only fearful lest their welcome of the past\r\nnight should in any way be withdrawn or altered. But presently little\r\nBeatrix came out into the garden, and her mother followed, who greeted\r\nHarry as kindly as before. He told her at greater length the histories\r\nof the house (which he had been taught in the old lord's time), and\r\nto which she listened with great interest; and then he told her, with\r\nrespect to the night before, that he understood French, and thanked her\r\nfor her protection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d says she, with a blush; \xe2\x80\x9cthen, sir, you shall teach me and\r\nBeatrix.\xe2\x80\x9d And she asked him many more questions regarding himself, which\r\nhad best be told more fully and explicitly than in those brief replies\r\nwhich the lad made to his mistress's questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nRELATES HOW FRANCIS, FOURTH VISCOUNT, ARRIVES AT CASTLEWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Tis known that the name of Esmond and the estate of Castlewood, com.\r\nHants, came into possession of the present family through Dorothea,\r\ndaughter and heiress of Edward, Earl and Marquis Esmond, and Lord of\r\nCastlewood, which lady married, 23 Eliz., Henry Poyns, gent.; the said\r\nHenry being then a page in the household of her father. Francis, son and\r\nheir of the above Henry and Dorothea, who took the maternal name which\r\nthe family hath borne subsequently, was made Knight and Baronet by King\r\nJames the First; and being of a military disposition, remained long in\r\nGermany with the Elector-Palatine, in whose service Sir Francis incurred\r\nboth expense and danger, lending large sums of money to that\r\nunfortunate Prince; and receiving many wounds in the battles against the\r\nImperialists, in which Sir Francis engaged.\r\n\r\nOn his return home Sir Francis was rewarded for his services and\r\nmany sacrifices, by his late Majesty James the First, who graciously\r\nconferred upon this tried servant the post of Warden of the Butteries\r\nand Groom of the King's Posset, which high and confidential office he\r\nfilled in that king's and his unhappy successor's reign.\r\n\r\nHis age, and many wounds and infirmities, obliged Sir Francis to perform\r\nmuch of his duty by deputy: and his son, Sir George Esmond, knight and\r\nbanneret, first as his father's lieutenant, and afterwards as inheritor\r\nof his father's title and dignity, performed this office during almost\r\nthe whole of the reign of King Charles the First, and his two sons who\r\nsucceeded him.\r\n\r\nSir George Esmond married, rather beneath the rank that a person of his\r\nname and honor might aspire to, the daughter of Thos. Topham, of the\r\ncity of London, alderman and goldsmith, who, taking the Parliamentary\r\nside in the troubles then commencing, disappointed Sir George of the\r\nproperty which he expected at the demise of his father-in-law, who\r\ndevised his money to his second daughter, Barbara, a spinster.\r\n\r\nSir George Esmond, on his part, was conspicuous for his attachment and\r\nloyalty to the Royal cause and person: and the King being at Oxford in\r\n1642, Sir George, with the consent of his father, then very aged and\r\ninfirm, and residing at his house of Castlewood, melted the whole of the\r\nfamily plate for his Majesty's service.\r\n\r\nFor this, and other sacrifices and merits, his Majesty, by patent under\r\nthe Privy Seal, dated Oxford, Jan., 1643, was pleased to advance Sir\r\nFrancis Esmond to the dignity of Viscount Castlewood, of Shandon, in\r\nIreland: and the Viscount's estate being much impoverished by loans to\r\nthe King, which in those troublesome times his Majesty could not repay,\r\na grant of land in the plantations of Virginia was given to the Lord\r\nViscount.; part of which land is in possession of descendants of his\r\nfamily to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe first Viscount Castlewood died full of years, and within a few\r\nmonths after he had been advanced to his honors. He was succeeded by his\r\neldest son, the before-named George; and left issue besides, Thomas,\r\na colonel in the King's army, who afterwards joined the Usurper's\r\nGovernment; and Francis, in holy orders, who was slain whilst defending\r\nthe House of Castlewood against the Parliament, anno 1647.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lord Castlewood (the second Viscount), of King Charles the\r\nFirst's time, had no male issue save his one son, Eustace Esmond, who\r\nwas killed, with half of the Castlewood men beside him, at Worcester\r\nfight. The lands about Castlewood were sold and apportioned to the\r\nCommonwealth men; Castlewood being concerned in almost all of the plots\r\nagainst the Protector, after the death of the King, and up to King\r\nCharles the Second's restoration. My lord followed that king's Court\r\nabout in its exile, having ruined himself in its service. He had but one\r\ndaughter, who was of no great comfort to her father; for misfortune had\r\nnot taught those exiles sobriety of life; and it is said that the Duke\r\nof York and his brother the King both quarrelled about Isabel Esmond.\r\nShe was maid of honor to the Queen Henrietta Maria; she early joined the\r\nRoman Church; her father, a weak man, following her not long after at\r\nBreda.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Eustace Esmond at Worcester, Thomas Esmond, nephew to\r\nmy Lord Castlewood, and then a stripling, became heir to the title. His\r\nfather had taken the Parliament side in the quarrels, and so had been\r\nestranged from the chief of his house; and my Lord Castlewood was at\r\nfirst so much enraged to think that his title (albeit little more than\r\nan empty one now) should pass to a rascally Roundhead, that he would\r\nhave married again, and indeed proposed to do so to a vintner's daughter\r\nat Bruges, to whom his lordship owed a score for lodging when the King\r\nwas there, but for fear of the laughter of the Court, and the anger\r\nof his daughter, of whom he stood in awe; for she was in temper as\r\nimperious and violent as my lord, who was much enfeebled by wounds and\r\ndrinking, was weak.\r\n\r\nLord Castlewood would have had a match between his daughter Isabel and\r\nher cousin, the son of that Francis Esmond who was killed at Castlewood\r\nsiege. And the lady, it was said, took a fancy to the young man, who was\r\nher junior by several years (which circumstance she did not consider to\r\nbe a fault in him); but having paid his court, and being admitted to the\r\nintimacy of the house, he suddenly flung up his suit, when it seemed\r\nto be pretty prosperous, without giving a pretext for his behavior.\r\nHis friends rallied him at what they laughingly chose to call his\r\ninfidelity; Jack Churchill, Frank Esmond's lieutenant in the Royal\r\nRegiment of Foot-guards, getting the company which Esmond vacated, when\r\nhe left the Court and went to Tangier in a rage at discovering that his\r\npromotion depended on the complaisance of his elderly affianced bride.\r\nHe and Churchill, who had been condiscipuli at St. Paul's School, had\r\nwords about this matter; and Frank Esmond said to him with an oath,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack, your sister may be so-and-so, but by Jove my wife shan't!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nswords were drawn, and blood drawn too, until friends separated them on\r\nthis quarrel. Few men were so jealous about the point of honor in those\r\ndays; and gentlemen of good birth and lineage thought a royal blot was\r\nan ornament to their family coat. Frank Esmond retired in the sulks,\r\nfirst to Tangier, whence he returned after two years' service, settling\r\non a small property he had of his mother, near to Winchester, and became\r\na country gentleman, and kept a pack of beagles, and never came to\r\nCourt again in King Charles's time. But his uncle Castlewood was never\r\nreconciled to him; nor, for some time afterwards, his cousin whom he had\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nBy places, pensions, bounties from France, and gifts from the King,\r\nwhilst his daughter was in favor, Lord Castlewood, who had spent in the\r\nRoyal service his youth and fortune, did not retrieve the latter quite,\r\nand never cared to visit Castlewood, or repair it, since the death of\r\nhis son, but managed to keep a good house, and figure at Court, and to\r\nsave a considerable sum of ready money.\r\n\r\nAnd now, his heir and nephew, Thomas Esmond, began to bid for his\r\nuncle's favor. Thomas had served with the Emperor, and with the Dutch,\r\nwhen King Charles was compelled to lend troops to the States; and\r\nagainst them, when his Majesty made an alliance with the French King. In\r\nthese campaigns Thomas Esmond was more remarked for duelling, brawling,\r\nvice, and play, than for any conspicuous gallantry in the field, and\r\ncame back to England, like many another English gentleman who has\r\ntravelled, with a character by no means improved by his foreign\r\nexperience. He had dissipated his small paternal inheritance of a\r\nyounger brother's portion, and, as truth must be told, was no better\r\nthan a hanger-on of ordinaries, and a brawler about Alsatia and the\r\nFriars, when he bethought him of a means of mending his fortune.\r\n\r\nHis cousin was now of more than middle age, and had nobody's word but\r\nher own for the beauty which she said she once possessed. She was lean,\r\nand yellow, and long in the tooth; all the red and white in all the\r\ntoy-shops in London could not make a beauty of her--Mr. Killigrew called\r\nher the Sybil, the death's-head put up at the King's feast as a memento\r\nmori, &c.--in fine, a woman who might be easy of conquest, but whom\r\nonly a very bold man would think of conquering. This bold man was Thomas\r\nEsmond. He had a fancy to my Lord Castlewood's savings, the amount of\r\nwhich rumor had very much exaggerated. Madame Isabel was said to have\r\nRoyal jewels of great value; whereas poor Tom Esmond's last coat but one\r\nwas in pawn.\r\n\r\nMy lord had at this time a fine house in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, nigh to\r\nthe Duke's Theatre and the Portugal ambassador's chapel. Tom Esmond,\r\nwho had frequented the one as long as he had money to spend among the\r\nactresses, now came to the church as assiduously. He looked so lean and\r\nshabby, that he passed without difficulty for a repentant sinner; and\r\nso, becoming converted, you may be sure took his uncle's priest for a\r\ndirector.\r\n\r\nThis charitable father reconciled him with the old lord, his uncle,\r\nwho a short time before would not speak to him, as Tom passed under my\r\nlord's coach window, his lordship going in state to his place at Court,\r\nwhile his nephew slunk by with his battered hat and feather, and the\r\npoint of his rapier sticking out of the scabbard--to his twopenny\r\nordinary in Bell Yard.\r\n\r\nThomas Esmond, after this reconciliation with his uncle, very soon began\r\nto grow sleek, and to show signs of the benefits of good living and\r\nclean linen. He fasted rigorously twice a week, to be sure; but he made\r\namends on the other days: and, to show how great his appetite was, Mr.\r\nWycherley said, he ended by swallowing that fly-blown rank old morsel\r\nhis cousin. There were endless jokes and lampoons about this marriage at\r\nCourt: but Tom rode thither in his uncle's coach now, called him father,\r\nand having won could afford to laugh. This marriage took place very\r\nshortly before King Charles died: whom the Viscount of Castlewood\r\nspeedily followed.\r\n\r\nThe issue of this marriage was one son, whom the parents watched with an\r\nintense eagerness and care; but who, in spite of nurses and physicians,\r\nhad only a brief existence. His tainted blood did not run very long in\r\nhis poor feeble little body. Symptoms of evil broke out early on him;\r\nand, part from flattery, part superstition, nothing would satisfy my\r\nlord and lady, especially the latter, but having the poor little cripple\r\ntouched by his Majesty at his church. They were ready to cry out miracle\r\nat first (the doctors and quack-salvers being constantly in attendance\r\non the child, and experimenting on his poor little body with every\r\nconceivable nostrum) but though there seemed, from some reason, a\r\nnotable amelioration in the infant's health after his Majesty touched\r\nhim, in a few weeks afterward the poor thing died--causing the\r\nlampooners of the Court to say, that the King, in expelling evil out of\r\nthe infant of Tom Esmond and Isabella his wife, expelled the life out of\r\nit, which was nothing but corruption.\r\n\r\nThe mother's natural pang at losing this poor little child must have\r\nbeen increased when she thought of her rival Frank Esmond's wife, who\r\nwas a favorite of the whole Court, where my poor Lady Castlewood was\r\nneglected, and who had one child, a daughter, flourishing and beautiful,\r\nand was about to become a mother once more.\r\n\r\nThe Court, as I have heard, only laughed the more because the poor lady,\r\nwho had pretty well passed the age when ladies are accustomed to have\r\nchildren, nevertheless determined not to give hope up, and even when she\r\ncame to live at Castlewood, was constantly sending over to Hexton for\r\nthe doctor, and announcing to her friends the arrival of an heir. This\r\nabsurdity of hers was one amongst many others which the wags used to\r\nplay upon. Indeed, to the last days of her life, my Lady Viscountess had\r\nthe comfort of fancying herself beautiful, and persisted in blooming\r\nup to the very midst of winter, painting roses on her cheeks long after\r\ntheir natural season, and attiring herself like summer though her head\r\nwas covered with snow.\r\n\r\nGentlemen who were about the Court of King Charles, and King James, have\r\ntold the present writer a number of stories about this queer old lady,\r\nwith which it's not necessary that posterity should be entertained. She\r\nis said to have had great powers of invective and, if she fought with\r\nall her rivals in King James's favor, 'tis certain she must have had\r\na vast number of quarrels on her hands. She was a woman of an intrepid\r\nspirit, and, it appears, pursued and rather fatigued his Majesty with\r\nher rights and her wrongs. Some say that the cause of her leaving Court\r\nwas jealousy of Frank Esmond's wife: others, that she was forced to\r\nretreat after a great battle which took place at Whitehall, between her\r\nladyship and Lady Dorchester, Tom Killigrew's daughter, whom the King\r\ndelighted to honor, and in which that ill-favored Esther got the better\r\nof our elderly Vashti. But her ladyship, for her part, always averred\r\nthat it was her husband's quarrel, and not her own, which occasioned the\r\nbanishment of the two into the country; and the cruel ingratitude of the\r\nSovereign in giving away, out of the family, that place of Warden of\r\nthe Butteries and Groom of the King's Posset, which the two last Lords\r\nCastlewood had held so honorably, and which was now conferred upon a\r\nfellow of yesterday, and a hanger-on of that odious Dorchester creature,\r\nmy Lord Bergamot;* \xe2\x80\x9cI never,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady, \xe2\x80\x9ccould have come to see his\r\nMajesty's posset carried by any other hand than an Esmond. I should have\r\ndashed the salver out of Lord Bergamot's hand, had I met him.\xe2\x80\x9d And those\r\nwho knew her ladyship are aware that she was a person quite capable of\r\nperforming this feat, had she not wisely kept out of the way.\r\n\r\n     * Lionel Tipton, created Baron Bergamot, ann. 1686,\r\n     Gentleman Usher of the Back Stairs, and afterwards appointed\r\n     Warden of the Butteries and Groom of the King's Posset (on\r\n     the decease of George, second Viscount Castlewood),\r\n     accompanied his Majesty to St. Germain's, where he died\r\n     without issue.  No Groom of the Posset was appointed by the\r\n     Prince of Orange, nor hath there been such an officer in any\r\n     succeeding reign.\r\n\r\nHolding the purse-strings in her own control, to which, indeed, she\r\nliked to bring most persons who came near her, Lady Castlewood could\r\ncommand her husband's obedience, and so broke up her establishment\r\nat London; she had removed from Lincoln's-Inn-Fields to Chelsey, to a\r\npretty new house she bought there; and brought her establishment, her\r\nmaids, lap-dogs, and gentlewomen, her priest, and his lordship her\r\nhusband, to Castlewood Hall, that she had never seen since she quitted\r\nit as a child with her father during the troubles of King Charles the\r\nFirst's reign. The walls were still open in the old house as they had\r\nbeen left by the shot of the Commonwealthmen. A part of the mansion\r\nwas restored and furbished up with the plate, hangings, and furniture\r\nbrought from the house in London. My lady meant to have a triumphal\r\nentry into Castlewood village, and expected the people to cheer as\r\nshe drove over the Green in her great coach, my lord beside her, her\r\ngentlewomen, lap-dogs, and cockatoos on the opposite seat, six horses to\r\nher carriage, and servants armed and mounted following it and preceding\r\nit. But 'twas in the height of the No-Popery cry; the folks in the\r\nvillage and the neighboring town were scared by the sight of her\r\nladyship's painted face and eyelids, as she bobbed her head out of the\r\ncoach window, meaning, no doubt, to be very gracious; and one old woman\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cLady Isabel! lord-a-mercy, it's Lady Jezebel!\xe2\x80\x9d a name by which\r\nthe enemies of the right honorable Viscountess were afterwards in the\r\nhabit of designating her. The country was then in a great No-Popery\r\nfervor; her ladyship's known conversion, and her husband's, the priest\r\nin her train, and the service performed at the chapel of Castlewood\r\n(though the chapel had been built for that worship before any other was\r\nheard of in the country, and though the service was performed in the\r\nmost quiet manner), got her no favor at first in the county or\r\nvillage. By far the greater part of the estate of Castlewood had been\r\nconfiscated, and been parcelled out to Commonwealthmen. One or two of\r\nthese old Cromwellian soldiers were still alive in the village, and\r\nlooked grimly at first upon my Lady Viscountess, when she came to dwell\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nShe appeared at the Hexton Assembly, bringing her lord after her,\r\nscaring the country folks with the splendor of her diamonds, which she\r\nalways wore in public. They said she wore them in private, too, and\r\nslept with them round her neck; though the writer can pledge his word\r\nthat this was a calumny. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she were to take them off,\xe2\x80\x9d my Lady Sark\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cTom Esmond, her husband, would run away with them and pawn them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n 'Twas another calumny. My Lady Sark was also an exile from Court, and\r\nthere had been war between the two ladies before.\r\n\r\nThe village people began to be reconciled presently to their lady, who\r\nwas generous and kind, though fantastic and haughty, in her ways; and\r\nwhose praises Dr. Tusher, the Vicar, sounded loudly amongst his flock.\r\nAs for my lord, he gave no great trouble, being considered scarce more\r\nthan an appendage to my lady, who, as daughter of the old lords of\r\nCastlewood, and possessor of vast wealth, as the country folks said\r\n(though indeed nine-tenths of it existed but in rumor), was looked upon\r\nas the real queen of the Castle, and mistress of all it contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHITHER IN THE TIME OF THOMAS, THIRD VISCOUNT, I HAD PRECEDED HIM AS\r\nPAGE TO ISABELLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nComing up to London again some short time after this retreat, the Lord\r\nCastlewood despatched a retainer of his to a little Cottage in the\r\nvillage of Ealing, near to London, where for some time had dwelt an\r\nold French refugee, by name Mr. Pastoureau, one of those whom the\r\npersecution of the Huguenots by the French king had brought over to this\r\ncountry. With this old man lived a little lad, who went by the name of\r\nHenry Thomas. He remembered to have lived in another place a short time\r\nbefore, near to London too, amongst looms and spinning-wheels, and a\r\ngreat deal of psalm-singing and church-going, and a whole colony of\r\nFrenchmen.\r\n\r\nThere he had a dear, dear friend, who died, and whom he called Aunt. She\r\nused to visit him in his dreams sometimes; and her face, though it was\r\nhomely, was a thousand times dearer to him than that of Mrs. Pastoureau,\r\nBon Papa Pastoureau's new wife, who came to live with him after aunt\r\nwent away. And there, at Spittlefields, as it used to be called, lived\r\nUncle George, who was a weaver too, but used to tell Harry that he was\r\na little gentleman, and that his father was a captain, and his mother an\r\nangel.\r\n\r\nWhen he said so, Bon Papa used to look up from the loom, where he was\r\nembroidering beautiful silk flowers, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cAngel! she belongs to the\r\nBabylonish scarlet woman.\xe2\x80\x9d Bon Papa was always talking of the scarlet\r\nwoman. He had a little room where he always used to preach and\r\nsing hymns out of his great old nose. Little Harry did not like the\r\npreaching; he liked better the fine stories which aunt used to tell him.\r\nBon Papa's wife never told him pretty stories; she quarrelled with Uncle\r\nGeorge, and he went away.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Harry's Bon Papa and his wife and two children of her own\r\nthat she brought with her, came to live at Ealing. The new wife gave her\r\nchildren the best of everything, and Harry many a whipping, he knew not\r\nwhy. Besides blows, he got ill names from her, which need not be set\r\ndown here, for the sake of old Mr. Pastoureau, who was still kind\r\nsometimes. The unhappiness of those days is long forgiven, though they\r\ncast a shade of melancholy over the child's youth, which will accompany\r\nhim, no doubt, to the end of his days: as those tender twigs are bent\r\nthe trees grow afterward; and he, at least, who has suffered as a child,\r\nand is not quite perverted in that early school of unhappiness, learns\r\nto be gentle and long-suffering with little children.\r\n\r\nHarry was very glad when a gentleman dressed in black, on horseback,\r\nwith a mounted servant behind him, came to fetch him away from Ealing.\r\nThe noverca, or unjust stepmother, who had neglected him for her own\r\ntwo children, gave him supper enough the night before he went away, and\r\nplenty in the morning. She did not beat him once, and told the children\r\nto keep their hands off him. One was a girl, and Harry never could bear\r\nto strike a girl; and the other was a boy, whom he could easily have\r\nbeat, but he always cried out, when Mrs. Pastoureau came sailing to the\r\nrescue with arms like a flail. She only washed Harry's face the day he\r\nwent away; nor ever so much as once boxed his ears. She whimpered rather\r\nwhen the gentleman in black came for the boy; and old Mr. Pastoureau, as\r\nhe gave the child his blessing, scowled over his shoulder at the strange\r\ngentleman, and grumbled out something about Babylon and the scarlet\r\nlady. He was grown quite old, like a child almost. Mrs. Pastoureau\r\nused to wipe his nose as she did to the children. She was a great, big,\r\nhandsome young woman; but, though she pretended to cry, Harry thought\r\n'twas only a sham, and sprung quite delighted upon the horse upon which\r\nthe lackey helped him.\r\n\r\nHe was a Frenchman; his name was Blaise. The child could talk to him in\r\nhis own language perfectly well: he knew it better than English indeed,\r\nhaving lived hitherto chiefly among French people: and being called the\r\nLittle Frenchman by other boys on Ealing Green. He soon learnt to speak\r\nEnglish perfectly, and to forget some of his French: children forget\r\neasily. Some earlier and fainter recollections the child had of a\r\ndifferent country; and a town with tall white houses: and a ship. But\r\nthese were quite indistinct in the boy's mind, as indeed the memory of\r\nEaling soon became, at least of much that he suffered there.\r\n\r\nThe lackey before whom he rode was very lively and voluble, and informed\r\nthe boy that the gentleman riding before him was my lord's chaplain,\r\nFather Holt--that he was now to be called Master Harry Esmond--that my\r\nLord Viscount Castlewood was his parrain--that he was to live at the\r\ngreat house of Castlewood, in the province of ----shire, where he would\r\nsee Madame the Viscountess, who was a grand lady. And so, seated on a\r\ncloth before Blaise's saddle, Harry Esmond was brought to London, and to\r\na fine square called Covent Garden, near to which his patron lodged.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt, the priest, took the child by the hand, and brought him to\r\nthis nobleman, a grand languid nobleman in a great cap and flowered\r\nmorning-gown, sucking oranges. He patted Harry on the head and gave him\r\nan orange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC'est bien ca,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the priest after eying the child, and the\r\ngentleman in black shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet Blaise take him out for a holiday,\xe2\x80\x9d and out for a holiday the boy\r\nand the valet went. Harry went jumping along; he was glad enough to go.\r\n\r\nHe will remember to his life's end the delights of those days. He was\r\ntaken to see a play by Monsieur Blaise, in a house a thousand times\r\ngreater and finer than the booth at Ealing Fair--and on the next happy\r\nday they took water on the river, and Harry saw London Bridge, with the\r\nhouses and booksellers' shops thereon, looking like a street, and the\r\nTower of London, with the Armor, and the great lions and bears in the\r\nmoat--all under company of Monsieur Blaise.\r\n\r\nPresently, of an early morning, all the party set forth for the country,\r\nnamely, my Lord Viscount and the other gentleman; Monsieur Blaise\r\nand Harry on a pillion behind them, and two or three men with pistols\r\nleading the baggage-horses. And all along the road the Frenchman told\r\nlittle Harry stories of brigands, which made the child's hair stand\r\non end, and terrified him; so that at the great gloomy inn on the road\r\nwhere they lay, he besought to be allowed to sleep in a room with one\r\nof the servants, and was compassionated by Mr. Holt, the gentleman\r\nwho travelled with my lord, and who gave the child a little bed in his\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nHis artless talk and answers very likely inclined this gentleman in the\r\nboy's favor, for next day Mr. Holt said Harry should ride behind him,\r\nand not with the French lacky; and all along the journey put a thousand\r\nquestions to the child--as to his foster-brother and relations at\r\nEaling; what his old grandfather had taught him; what languages he knew;\r\nwhether he could read and write, and sing, and so forth. And Mr. Holt\r\nfound that Harry could read and write, and possessed the two languages\r\nof French and English very well; and when he asked Harry about singing,\r\nthe lad broke out with a hymn to the tune of Dr. Martin Luther, which\r\nset Mr. Holt a-laughing; and even caused his grand parrain in the laced\r\nhat and periwig to laugh too when Holt told him what the child was\r\nsinging. For it appeared that Dr. Martin Luther's hymns were not sung in\r\nthe churches Mr. Holt preached at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must never sing that song any more: do you hear, little mannikin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says my Lord Viscount, holding up a finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we will try and teach you a better, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holt said; and\r\nthe child answered, for he was a docile child, and of an affectionate\r\nnature, \xe2\x80\x9cThat he loved pretty songs, and would try and learn anything\r\nthe gentleman would tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d That day he so pleased the gentlemen by\r\nhis talk, that they had him to dine with them at the inn, and encouraged\r\nhim in his prattle; and Monsieur Blaise, with whom he rode and dined the\r\nday before, waited upon him now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis well, 'tis well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blaise, that night (in his own language)\r\nwhen they lay again at an inn. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a little lord here; we are a\r\nlittle lord now: we shall see what we are when we come to Castlewood,\r\nwhere my lady is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall we come to Castlewood, Monsieur Blaise?\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu! my lord does not press himself,\xe2\x80\x9d Blaise says, with a grin;\r\nand, indeed, it seemed as if his lordship was not in a great hurry, for\r\nhe spent three days on that journey which Harry Esmond hath often since\r\nridden in a dozen hours. For the last two of the days Harry rode with\r\nthe priest, who was so kind to him, that the child had grown to be\r\nquite fond and familiar with him by the journey's end, and had scarce\r\na thought in his little heart which by that time he had not confided to\r\nhis new friend.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the third day, at evening, they came to a village standing\r\non a green with elms round it, very pretty to look at; and the people\r\nthere all took off their hats, and made curtsies to my Lord Viscount,\r\nwho bowed to them all languidly; and there was one portly person that\r\nwore a cassock and a broad-leafed hat, who bowed lower than any one--and\r\nwith this one both my lord and Mr. Holt had a few words. \xe2\x80\x9cThis, Harry,\r\nis Castlewood church,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Holt, \xe2\x80\x9cand this is the pillar thereof,\r\nlearned Doctor Tusher. Take off your hat, sirrah, and salute Dr.\r\nTusher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome up to supper, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord; at which the Doctor made\r\nanother low bow, and the party moved on towards a grand house that\r\nwas before them, with many gray towers and vanes on them, and windows\r\nflaming in the sunshine; and a great army of rooks, wheeling over their\r\nheads, made for the woods behind the house, as Harry saw; and Mr. Holt\r\ntold him that they lived at Castlewood too.\r\n\r\nThey came to the house, and passed under an arch into a court-yard, with\r\na fountain in the centre, where many men came and held my lord's stirrup\r\nas he descended, and paid great respect to Mr. Holt likewise. And the\r\nchild thought that the servants looked at him curiously, and smiled to\r\none another--and he recalled what Blaise had said to him when they were\r\nin London, and Harry had spoken about his godpapa, when the Frenchman\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cParbleu, one sees well that my lord is your godfather;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n words whereof the poor lad did not know the meaning then, though he\r\napprehended the truth in a very short time afterwards, and learned it,\r\nand thought of it with no small feeling of shame.\r\n\r\nTaking Harry by the hand as soon as they were both descended from their\r\nhorses, Mr. Holt led him across the court, and under a low door to rooms\r\non a level with the ground; one of which Father Holt said was to be\r\nthe boy's chamber, the other on the other side of the passage being the\r\nFather's own; and as soon as the little man's face was washed, and the\r\nFather's own dress arranged, Harry's guide took him once more to the\r\ndoor by which my lord had entered the hall, and up a stair, and through\r\nan ante-room to my lady's drawing-room--an apartment than which Harry\r\nthought he had never seen anything more grand--no, not in the Tower\r\nof London which he had just visited. Indeed, the chamber was richly\r\nornamented in the manner of Queen Elizabeth's time, with great stained\r\nwindows at either end, and hangings of tapestry, which the sun shining\r\nthrough the colored glass painted of a thousand lines; and here in\r\nstate, by the fire, sat a lady to whom the priest took up Harry, who was\r\nindeed amazed by her appearance.\r\n\r\nMy Lady Viscountess's face was daubed with white and red up to the eyes,\r\nto which the paint gave an unearthly glare: she had a tower of lace on\r\nher head, under which was a bush of black curls--borrowed curls--so that\r\nno wonder little Harry Esmond was scared when he was first presented to\r\nher--the kind priest acting as master of the ceremonies at that solemn\r\nintroduction--and he stared at her with eyes almost as great as her own,\r\nas he had stared at the player woman who acted the wicked tragedy-queen,\r\nwhen the players came down to Ealing Fair. She sat in a great chair by\r\nthe fire-corner; in her lap was a spaniel-dog that barked furiously; on\r\na little table by her was her ladyship's snuff-box and her sugar-plum\r\nbox. She wore a dress of black velvet, and a petticoat of flame-colored\r\nbrocade. She had as many rings on her fingers as the old woman of\r\nBanbury Cross; and pretty small feet which she was fond of showing, with\r\ngreat gold clocks to her stockings, and white pantofles with red heels;\r\nand an odor of musk was shook out of her garments whenever she moved\r\nor quitted the room, leaning on her tortoise-shell stick, little Fury\r\nbarking at her heels.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tusher, the parson's wife, was with my lady. She had been\r\nwaiting-woman to her ladyship in the late lord's time, and, having her\r\nsoul in that business, took naturally to it when the Viscountess of\r\nCastlewood returned to inhabit her father's house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI present to your ladyship your kinsman and little page of honor,\r\nMaster Henry Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holt said, bowing lowly, with a sort of\r\ncomical humility. \xe2\x80\x9cMake a pretty bow to my lady, Monsieur; and then\r\nanother little bow, not so low, to Madame Tusher--the fair priestess of\r\nCastlewood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I have lived and hope to die, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says Madame Tusher, giving a\r\nhard glance at the brat, and then at my lady.\r\n\r\nUpon her the boy's whole attention was for a time directed. He could not\r\nkeep his great eyes off from her. Since the Empress of Ealing, he had\r\nseen nothing so awful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes my appearance please you, little page?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be very hard to please if it didn't,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Tusher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done, you silly Maria,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Castlewood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I'm attached, I'm attached, Madame--and I'd die rather than not\r\nsay so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe meurs ou je m'attache,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holt said with a polite grin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ivy\r\nsays so in the picture, and clings to the oak like a fond parasite as it\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParricide, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Mrs. Tusher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Tusher--you are always bickering with Father Holt,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my\r\nlady. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and kiss my hand, child;\xe2\x80\x9d and the oak held out a BRANCH to\r\nlittle Harry Esmond, who took and dutifully kissed the lean old hand,\r\nupon the gnarled knuckles of which there glittered a hundred rings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo kiss that hand would make many a pretty fellow happy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs.\r\nTusher: on which my lady crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cGo, you foolish Tusher!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ntapping her with her great fan, Tusher ran forward to seize her hand\r\nand kiss it. Fury arose and barked furiously at Tusher; and Father Holt\r\nlooked on at this queer scene, with arch, grave glances.\r\n\r\nThe awe exhibited by the little boy perhaps pleased the lady to whom\r\nthis artless flattery was bestowed: for having gone down on his knee (as\r\nFather Holt had directed him, and the mode then was) and performed his\r\nobeisance, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cPage Esmond, my groom of the chamber will inform\r\nyou what your duties are, when you wait upon my lord and me; and good\r\nFather Holt will instruct you as becomes a gentleman of our name. You\r\nwill pay him obedience in everything, and I pray you may grow to be as\r\nlearned and as good as your tutor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady seemed to have the greatest reverence for Mr. Holt, and to be\r\nmore afraid of him than of anything else in the world. If she was ever\r\nso angry, a word or look from Father Holt made her calm: indeed he had\r\na vast power of subjecting those who came near him; and, among the rest,\r\nhis new pupil gave himself up with an entire confidence and attachment\r\nto the good Father, and became his willing slave almost from the first\r\nmoment he saw him.\r\n\r\nHe put his small hand into the Father's as he walked away from his first\r\npresentation to his mistress, and asked many questions in his artless\r\nchildish way. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that other woman?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is fat and\r\nround; she is more pretty than my Lady Castlewood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is Madame Tusher, the parson's wife of Castlewood. She has a son of\r\nyour age, but bigger than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does she like so to kiss my lady's hand. It is not good to kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTastes are different, little man. Madame Tusher is attached to my lady,\r\nhaving been her waiting-woman before she was married, in the old lord's\r\ntime. She married Doctor Tusher the chaplain. The English household\r\ndivines often marry the waiting-women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not marry the French woman, will you? I saw her laughing with\r\nBlaise in the buttery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI belong to a church that is older and better than the English church,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mr. Holt said (making a sign whereof Esmond did not then understand the\r\nmeaning, across his breast and forehead); \xe2\x80\x9cin our church the clergy do\r\nnot marry. You will understand these things better soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas not Saint Peter the head of your church?--Dr. Rabbits of Ealing\r\ntold us so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Father said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Saint Peter was married, for we heard only last Sunday that his\r\nwife's mother lay sick of a fever.\xe2\x80\x9d On which the Father again laughed,\r\nand said he would understand this too better soon, and talked of other\r\nthings, and took away Harry Esmond, and showed him the great old house\r\nwhich he had come to inhabit.\r\n\r\nIt stood on a rising green hill, with woods behind it, in which were\r\nrooks' nests, where the birds at morning and returning home at evening\r\nmade a great cawing. At the foot of the hill was a river, with a steep\r\nancient bridge crossing it; and beyond that a large pleasant green flat,\r\nwhere the village of Castlewood stood, and stands, with the church in\r\nthe midst, the parsonage hard by it, the inn with the blacksmith's forge\r\nbeside it, and the sign of the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Castles\xe2\x80\x9d on the elm. The London\r\nroad stretched away towards the rising sun, and to the west were\r\nswelling hills and peaks, behind which many a time Harry Esmond saw the\r\nsame sun setting, that he now looks on thousands of miles away across\r\nthe great ocean--in a new Castlewood, by another stream, that bears,\r\nlike the new country of wandering AEneas, the fond names of the land of\r\nhis youth.\r\n\r\nThe Hall of Castlewood was built with two courts, whereof one only, the\r\nfountain-court, was now inhabited, the other having been battered down\r\nin the Cromwellian wars. In the fountain-court, still in good repair,\r\nwas the great hall, near to the kitchen and butteries. A dozen of\r\nliving-rooms looking to the north, and communicating with the little\r\nchapel that faced eastwards and the buildings stretching from that to\r\nthe main gate, and with the hall (which looked to the west) into the\r\ncourt now dismantled. This court had been the most magnificent of the\r\ntwo, until the Protector's cannon tore down one side of it before the\r\nplace was taken and stormed. The besiegers entered at the terrace under\r\nthe clock-tower, slaying every man of the garrison, and at their head my\r\nlord's brother, Francis Esmond.\r\n\r\nThe Restoration did not bring enough money to the Lord Castlewood to\r\nrestore this ruined part of his house; where were the morning parlors,\r\nabove them the long music-gallery, and before which stretched the\r\ngarden-terrace, where, however, the flowers grew again which the boots\r\nof the Roundheads had trodden in their assault, and which was restored\r\nwithout much cost, and only a little care, by both ladies who succeeded\r\nthe second viscount in the government of this mansion. Round the\r\nterrace-garden was a low wall with a wicket leading to the wooded height\r\nbeyond, that is called Cromwell's Battery to this day.\r\n\r\nYoung Harry Esmond learned the domestic part of his duty, which was easy\r\nenough, from the groom of her ladyship's chamber: serving the Countess,\r\nas the custom commonly was in his boyhood, as page, waiting at\r\nher chair, bringing her scented water and the silver basin after\r\ndinner--sitting on her carriage-step on state occasions, or on public\r\ndays introducing her company to her. This was chiefly of the Catholic\r\ngentry, of whom there were a pretty many in the country and neighboring\r\ncity; and who rode not seldom to Castlewood to partake of the\r\nhospitalities there. In the second year of their residence, the company\r\nseemed especially to increase. My lord and my lady were seldom without\r\nvisitors, in whose society it was curious to contrast the difference\r\nof behavior between Father Holt, the director of the family, and Doctor\r\nTusher, the rector of the parish--Mr. Holt moving amongst the very\r\nhighest as quite their equal, and as commanding them all; while poor\r\nDoctor Tusher, whose position was indeed a difficult one, having been\r\nchaplain once to the Hall, and still to the Protestant servants there,\r\nseemed more like an usher than an equal, and always rose to go away\r\nafter the first course.\r\n\r\nAlso there came in these times to Father Holt many private visitors,\r\nwhom, after a little, Henry Esmond had little difficulty in recognizing\r\nas ecclesiastics of the Father's persuasion, whatever their dresses\r\n(and they adopted all) might be. These were closeted with the Father\r\nconstantly, and often came and rode away without paying their devoirs to\r\nmy lord and lady--to the lady and lord rather--his lordship being little\r\nmore than a cipher in the house, and entirely under his domineering\r\npartner. A little fowling, a little hunting, a great deal of sleep, and\r\na long dine at cards and table, carried through one day after another\r\nwith his lordship. When meetings took place in this second year, which\r\noften would happen with closed doors, the page found my lord's sheet of\r\npaper scribbled over with dogs and horses, and 'twas said he had much\r\nado to keep himself awake at these councils: the Countess ruling over\r\nthem, and he acting as little more than her secretary.\r\n\r\nFather Holt began speedily to be so much occupied with these meetings\r\nas rather to neglect the education of the little lad who so gladly put\r\nhimself under the kind priest's orders. At first they read much and\r\nregularly, both in Latin and French; the Father not neglecting in\r\nanything to impress his faith upon his pupil, but not forcing him\r\nviolently, and treating him with a delicacy and kindness which surprised\r\nand attached the child, always more easily won by these methods than by\r\nany severe exercise of authority. And his delight in their walks was to\r\ntell Harry of the glories of his order, of its martyrs and heroes, of\r\nits Brethren converting the heathen by myriads, traversing the desert,\r\nfacing the stake, ruling the courts and councils, or braving the\r\ntortures of kings; so that Harry Esmond thought that to belong to the\r\nJesuits was the greatest prize of life and bravest end of ambition; the\r\ngreatest career here, and in heaven the surest reward; and began to\r\nlong for the day, not only when he should enter into the one church\r\nand receive his first communion, but when he might join that wonderful\r\nbrotherhood, which was present throughout all the world, and which\r\nnumbered the wisest, the bravest, the highest born, the most eloquent of\r\nmen among its members. Father Holt bade him keep his views secret,\r\nand to hide them as a great treasure which would escape him if it was\r\nrevealed; and, proud of this confidence and secret vested in him,\r\nthe lad became fondly attached to the master who initiated him into\r\na mystery so wonderful and awful. And when little Tom Tusher, his\r\nneighbor, came from school for his holiday, and said how he, too, was\r\nto be bred up for an English priest, and would get what he called\r\nan exhibition from his school, and then a college scholarship and\r\nfellowship, and then a good living--it tasked young Harry Esmond's\r\npowers of reticence not to say to his young companion, \xe2\x80\x9cChurch!\r\npriesthood! fat living! My dear Tommy, do you call yours a church and\r\na priesthood? What is a fat living compared to converting a hundred\r\nthousand heathens by a single sermon? What is a scholarship at Trinity\r\nby the side of a crown of martyrdom, with angels awaiting you as your\r\nhead is taken off? Could your master at school sail over the Thames on\r\nhis gown? Have you statues in your church that can bleed, speak, walk,\r\nand cry? My good Tommy, in dear Father Holt's church these things take\r\nplace every day. You know Saint Philip of the Willows appeared to Lord\r\nCastlewood, and caused him to turn to the one true church. No saints\r\never come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d And Harry Esmond, because of his promise to Father\r\nHolt, hiding away these treasures of faith from T. Tusher, delivered\r\nhimself of them nevertheless simply to Father Holt; who stroked his\r\nhead, smiled at him with his inscrutable look, and told him that he did\r\nwell to meditate on these great things, and not to talk of them except\r\nunder direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nI AM PLACED UNDER A POPISH PRIEST AND BRED TO THAT\r\nRELIGION.--VISCOUNTESS CASTLEWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad time enough been given, and his childish inclinations been properly\r\nnurtured, Harry Esmond had been a Jesuit priest ere he was a dozen years\r\nolder, and might have finished his days a martyr in China or a victim\r\non Tower Hill: for, in the few months they spent together at Castlewood,\r\nMr. Holt obtained an entire mastery over the boy's intellect and\r\naffections; and had brought him to think, as indeed Father Holt\r\nthought with all his heart too, that no life was so noble, no death so\r\ndesirable, as that which many brethren of his famous order were ready\r\nto undergo. By love, by a brightness of wit and good-humor that charmed\r\nall, by an authority which he knew how to assume, by a mystery and\r\nsilence about him which increased the child's reverence for him, he won\r\nHarry's absolute fealty, and would have kept it, doubtless, if schemes\r\ngreater and more important than a poor little boy's admission into\r\norders had not called him away.\r\n\r\nAfter being at home for a few months in tranquillity (if theirs might be\r\ncalled tranquillity, which was, in truth, a constant bickering), my lord\r\nand lady left the country for London, taking their director with them:\r\nand his little pupil scarce ever shed more bitter tears in his life than\r\nhe did for nights after the first parting with his dear friend, as he\r\nlay in the lonely chamber next to that which the Father used to occupy.\r\nHe and a few domestics were left as the only tenants of the great house:\r\nand, though Harry sedulously did all the tasks which the Father set him,\r\nhe had many hours unoccupied, and read in the library, and bewildered\r\nhis little brains with the great books he found there.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the little lad grew accustomed to the loneliness of the\r\nplace; and in after days remembered this part of his life as a\r\nperiod not unhappy. When the family was at London the whole of the\r\nestablishment travelled thither with the exception of the porter--who\r\nwas, moreover, brewer, gardener, and woodman--and his wife and children.\r\nThese had their lodging in the gate-house hard by, with a door into the\r\ncourt; and a window looking out on the green was the Chaplain's room;\r\nand next to this a small chamber where Father Holt had his books, and\r\nHarry Esmond his sleeping closet. The side of the house facing the\r\neast had escaped the guns of the Cromwellians, whose battery was on the\r\nheight facing the western court; so that this eastern end bore few marks\r\nof demolition, save in the chapel, where the painted windows surviving\r\nEdward the Sixth had been broke by the Commonwealthmen. In Father Holt's\r\ntime little Harry Esmond acted as his familiar and faithful little\r\nservitor; beating his clothes, folding his vestments, fetching his\r\nwater from the well long before daylight, ready to run anywhere for the\r\nservice of his beloved priest. When the Father was away, he locked his\r\nprivate chamber; but the room where the books were was left to little\r\nHarry, who, but for the society of this gentleman, was little less\r\nsolitary when Lord Castlewood was at home.\r\n\r\nThe French wit saith that a hero is none to his valet-de-chambre, and\r\nit required less quick eyes than my lady's little page was naturally\r\nendowed with, to see that she had many qualities by no means heroic,\r\nhowever much Mrs. Tusher might flatter and coax her. When Father Holt\r\nwas not by, who exercised an entire authority over the pair, my lord\r\nand my lady quarrelled and abused each other so as to make the servants\r\nlaugh, and to frighten the little page on duty. The poor boy trembled\r\nbefore his mistress, who called him by a hundred ugly names, who made\r\nnothing of boxing his ears, and tilting the silver basin in his face\r\nwhich it was his business to present to her after dinner. She hath\r\nrepaired, by subsequent kindness to him, these severities, which it must\r\nbe owned made his childhood very unhappy. She was but unhappy herself at\r\nthis time, poor soul! and I suppose made her dependants lead her own sad\r\nlife. I think my lord was as much afraid of her as her page was, and the\r\nonly person of the household who mastered her was Mr. Holt. Harry was\r\nonly too glad when the Father dined at table, and to slink away and\r\nprattle with him afterwards, or read with him, or walk with him.\r\nLuckily my Lady Viscountess did not rise till noon. Heaven help the poor\r\nwaiting-woman who had charge of her toilet! I have often seen the poor\r\nwretch come out with red eyes from the closet where those long and\r\nmysterious rites of her ladyship's dress were performed, and the\r\nbackgammon-box locked up with a rap on Mrs. Tusher's fingers when she\r\nplayed ill, or the game was going the wrong way.\r\n\r\nBlessed be the king who introduced cards, and the kind inventors\r\nof piquet and cribbage, for they employed six hours at least of her\r\nladyship's day, during which her family was pretty easy. Without this\r\noccupation my lady frequently declared she should die. Her dependants\r\none after another relieved guard--'twas rather a dangerous post to play\r\nwith her ladyship--and took the cards turn about. Mr. Holt would sit\r\nwith her at piquet during hours together, at which time she behaved\r\nherself properly; and as for Dr. Tusher, I believe he would have left a\r\nparishioner's dying bed, if summoned to play a rubber with his patroness\r\nat Castlewood. Sometimes, when they were pretty comfortable together,\r\nmy lord took a hand. Besides these my lady had her faithful poor Tusher,\r\nand one, two, three gentlewomen whom Harry Esmond could recollect in\r\nhis time. They could not bear that genteel service very long; one after\r\nanother tried and failed at it. These and the housekeeper, and little\r\nHarry Esmond, had a table of their own. Poor ladies their life was far\r\nharder than the page's. He was sound asleep, tucked up in his little\r\nbed, whilst they were sitting by her ladyship reading her to sleep, with\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cNews Letter\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cGrand Cyrus.\xe2\x80\x9d My lady used to have boxes of\r\nnew plays from London, and Harry was forbidden, under the pain of a\r\nwhipping, to look into them. I am afraid he deserved the penalty pretty\r\noften, and got it sometimes. Father Holt applied it twice or thrice,\r\nwhen he caught the young scapegrace with a delightful wicked comedy of\r\nMr. Shadwell's or Mr. Wycherley's under his pillow.\r\n\r\nThese, when he took any, were my lord's favorite reading. But he\r\nwas averse to much study, and, as his little page fancied, to much\r\noccupation of any sort.\r\n\r\nIt always seemed to young Harry Esmond that my lord treated him with\r\nmore kindness when his lady was not present, and Lord Castlewood would\r\ntake the lad sometimes on his little journeys a-hunting or a-birding;\r\nhe loved to play at cards and tric-trac with him, which games the boy\r\nlearned to pleasure his lord: and was growing to like him better daily,\r\nshowing a special pleasure if Father Holt gave a good report of him,\r\npatting him on the head, and promising that he would provide for the\r\nboy. However, in my lady's presence, my lord showed no such marks of\r\nkindness, and affected to treat the lad roughly, and rebuked him sharply\r\nfor little faults, for which he in a manner asked pardon of young Esmond\r\nwhen they were private, saying if he did not speak roughly, she would,\r\nand his tongue was not such a bad one as his lady's--a point whereof the\r\nboy, young as he was, was very well assured.\r\n\r\nGreat public events were happening all this while, of which the simple\r\nyoung page took little count. But one day, riding into the neighboring\r\ntown on the step of my lady's coach, his lordship and she and Father\r\nHolt being inside, a great mob of people came hooting and jeering round\r\nthe coach, bawling out \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bishops for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDown with the Pope!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nPopery! no Popery! Jezebel, Jezebel!\xe2\x80\x9d so that my lord began to laugh,\r\nmy lady's eyes to roll with anger, for she was as bold as a lioness,\r\nand feared nobody; whilst Mr. Holt, as Esmond saw from his place on the\r\nstep, sank back with rather an alarmed face, crying out to her ladyship,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God's sake, madam, do not speak or look out of window; sit still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But she did not obey this prudent injunction of the Father; she thrust\r\nher head out of the coach window, and screamed out to the coachman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlog your way through them, the brutes, James, and use your whip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mob answered with a roaring jeer of laughter, and fresh cries of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJezebel! Jezebel!\xe2\x80\x9d My lord only laughed the more: he was a languid\r\ngentleman: nothing seemed to excite him commonly, though I have seen\r\nhim cheer and halloo the hounds very briskly, and his face (which was\r\ngenerally very yellow and calm) grow quite red and cheerful during a\r\nburst over the Downs after a hare, and laugh, and swear, and huzzah at a\r\ncockfight, of which sport he was very fond. And now, when the mob began\r\nto hoot his lady, he laughed with something of a mischievous look, as\r\nthough he expected sport, and thought that she and they were a match.\r\n\r\nJames the coachman was more afraid of his mistress than the mob,\r\nprobably, for he whipped on his horses as he was bidden, and the\r\npost-boy that rode with the first pair (my lady always rode with her\r\ncoach-and-six,) gave a cut of his thong over the shoulders of one fellow\r\nwho put his hand out towards the leading horse's rein.\r\n\r\nIt was a market-day, and the country-people were all assembled with\r\ntheir baskets of poultry, eggs, and such things; the postilion had no\r\nsooner lashed the man who would have taken hold of his horse, but a\r\ngreat cabbage came whirling like a bombshell into the carriage, at which\r\nmy lord laughed more, for it knocked my lady's fan out of her hand, and\r\nplumped into Father Holt's stomach. Then came a shower of carrots and\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven's sake be still!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Holt; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not ten paces from\r\nthe 'Bell' archway, where they can shut the gates on us, and keep out\r\nthis canaille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little page was outside the coach on the step, and a fellow in the\r\ncrowd aimed a potato at him, and hit him in the eye, at which the poor\r\nlittle wretch set up a shout; the man laughed, a great big saddler's\r\napprentice of the town. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you d--- little yelling Popish bastard,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, and stooped to pick up another; the crowd had gathered quite\r\nbetween the horses and the inn door by this time, and the coach was\r\nbrought to a dead stand-still. My lord jumped as briskly as a boy out of\r\nthe door on his side of the coach, squeezing little Harry behind it; had\r\nhold of the potato-thrower's collar in an instant, and the next moment\r\nthe brute's heels were in the air, and he fell on the stones with a\r\nthump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hulking coward!\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou pack of screaming blackguards! how\r\ndare you attack children, and insult women? Fling another shot at that\r\ncarriage, you sneaking pigskin cobbler, and by the Lord I'll send my\r\nrapier through you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of the mob cried, \xe2\x80\x9cHuzzah, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d for they knew him, and\r\nthe saddler's man was a known bruiser, near twice as big as my lord\r\nViscount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake way there,\xe2\x80\x9d says he (he spoke in a high shrill voice, but with\r\na great air of authority). \xe2\x80\x9cMake way, and let her ladyship's carriage\r\npass.\xe2\x80\x9d The men that were between the coach and the gate of the \xe2\x80\x9cBell\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n actually did make way, and the horses went in, my lord walking after\r\nthem with his hat on his head.\r\n\r\nAs he was going in at the gate, through which the coach had just rolled,\r\nanother cry begins, of \xe2\x80\x9cNo Popery--no Papists!\xe2\x80\x9d My lord turns round and\r\nfaces them once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod save the King!\xe2\x80\x9d says he at the highest pitch of his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\ndares abuse the King's religion? You, you d--d psalm-singing cobbler,\r\nas sure as I'm a magistrate of this county I'll commit you!\xe2\x80\x9d The fellow\r\nshrank back, and my lord retreated with all the honors of the day.\r\nBut when the little flurry caused by the scene was over, and the flush\r\npassed off his face, he relapsed into his usual languor, trifled with\r\nhis little dog, and yawned when my lady spoke to him.\r\n\r\nThis mob was one of many thousands that were going about the country at\r\nthat time, huzzahing for the acquittal of the seven bishops who had been\r\ntried just then, and about whom little Harry Esmond at that time knew\r\nscarce anything. It was Assizes at Hexton, and there was a great meeting\r\nof the gentry at the \xe2\x80\x9cBell;\xe2\x80\x9d and my lord's people had their new liveries\r\non, and Harry a little suit of blue and silver, which he wore upon\r\noccasions of state; and the gentlefolks came round and talked to my\r\nlord: and a judge in a red gown, who seemed a very great personage,\r\nespecially complimented him and my lady, who was mighty grand. Harry\r\nremembers her train borne up by her gentlewoman. There was an assembly\r\nand ball at the great room at the \xe2\x80\x9cBell,\xe2\x80\x9d and other young gentlemen of\r\nthe county families looked on as he did. One of them jeered him for his\r\nblack eye, which was swelled by the potato, and another called him a\r\nbastard, on which he and Harry fell to fisticuffs. My lord's cousin,\r\nColonel Esmond of Walcote, was there, and separated the two lads--a\r\ngreat tall gentleman, with a handsome good-natured face. The boy did not\r\nknow how nearly in after-life he should be allied to Colonel Esmond, and\r\nhow much kindness he should have to owe him.\r\n\r\nThere was little love between the two families. My lady used not to\r\nspare Colonel Esmond in talking of him, for reasons which have been\r\nhinted already; but about which, at his tender age, Henry Esmond could\r\nbe expected to know nothing.\r\n\r\nVery soon afterwards, my lord and lady went to London with Mr. Holt,\r\nleaving, however, the page behind them. The little man had the great\r\nhouse of Castlewood to himself; or between him and the housekeeper, Mrs.\r\nWorksop, an old lady who was a kinswoman of the family in some distant\r\nway, and a Protestant, but a staunch Tory and king's-man, as all the\r\nEsmonds were. He used to go to school to Dr. Tusher when he was at home,\r\nthough the Doctor was much occupied too. There was a great stir and\r\ncommotion everywhere, even in the little quiet village of Castlewood,\r\nwhither a party of people came from the town, who would have broken\r\nCastlewood Chapel windows, but the village people turned out, and even\r\nold Sieveright, the republican blacksmith, along with them: for my\r\nlady, though she was a Papist, and had many odd ways, was kind to the\r\ntenantry, and there was always a plenty of beef, and blankets, and\r\nmedicine for the poor at Castlewood Hall.\r\n\r\nA kingdom was changing hands whilst my lord and lady were away. King\r\nJames was flying, the Dutchmen were coming; awful stories about them and\r\nthe Prince of Orange used old Mrs. Worksop to tell to the idle little\r\npage.\r\n\r\nHe liked the solitude of the great house very well; he had all the\r\nplay-books to read, and no Father Holt to whip him, and a hundred\r\nchildish pursuits and pastimes, without doors and within, which made\r\nthis time very pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMY SUPERIORS ARE ENGAGED IN PLOTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF KING JAMES II.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot having been able to sleep, for thinking of some lines for eels which\r\nhe had placed the night before, the lad was lying in his little bed,\r\nwaiting for the hour when the gate would be open, and he and his\r\ncomrade, John Lockwood, the porter's son, might go to the pond and see\r\nwhat fortune had brought them. At daybreak John was to awaken him, but\r\nhis own eagerness for the sport had served as a reveillez long since--so\r\nlong, that it seemed to him as if the day never would come.\r\n\r\nIt might have been four o'clock when he heard the door of the opposite\r\nchamber, the Chaplain's room, open, and the voice of a man coughing in\r\nthe passage. Harry jumped up, thinking for certain it was a robber, or\r\nhoping perhaps for a ghost, and, flinging open his own door, saw before\r\nhim the Chaplain's door open, and a light inside, and a figure standing\r\nin the doorway, in the midst of a great smoke which issued from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho's there?\xe2\x80\x9d cried out the boy, who was of a good spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilentium!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the other; \xe2\x80\x9c'tis I, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d and, holding his\r\nhand out, Harry had no difficulty in recognizing his master and friend,\r\nFather Holt. A curtain was over the window of the Chaplain's room that\r\nlooked to the court, and Harry saw that the smoke came from a great\r\nflame of papers which were burning in a brazier when he entered the\r\nChaplain's room. After giving a hasty greeting and blessing to the lad,\r\nwho was charmed to see his tutor, the Father continued the burning of\r\nhis papers, drawing them from a cupboard over the mantel-piece wall,\r\nwhich Harry had never seen before.\r\n\r\nFather Holt laughed, seeing the lad's attention fixed at once on this\r\nhole. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is right, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cfaithful little famuli, see all\r\nand say nothing. You are faithful, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I would go to the stake for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't want your head,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Father, patting it kindly; \xe2\x80\x9call you\r\nhave to do is to hold your tongue. Let us burn these papers, and say\r\nnothing to anybody. Should you like to read them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond blushed, and held down his head; he HAD looked as the fact\r\nwas, and without thinking, at the paper before him; and though he had\r\nseen it, could not understand a word of it, the letters being quite\r\nclear enough, but quite without meaning. They burned the papers, beating\r\ndown the ashes in a brazier, so that scarce any traces of them remained.\r\n\r\nHarry had been accustomed to see Father Holt in more dresses than one;\r\nit not being safe, or worth the danger, for Popish ecclesiastics to wear\r\ntheir proper dress; and he was, in consequence, in no wise astonished\r\nthat the priest should now appear before him in a riding-dress, with\r\nlarge buff leather boots, and a feather to his hat, plain, but such as\r\ngentlemen wore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the secret of the cupboard,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cand must be\r\nprepared for other mysteries;\xe2\x80\x9d and he opened--but not a secret cupboard\r\nthis time--only a wardrobe, which he usually kept locked, and from which\r\nhe now took out two or three dresses and perruques of different colors,\r\nand a couple of swords of a pretty make (Father Holt was an expert\r\npractitioner with the small-sword, and every day, whilst he was at home,\r\nhe and his pupil practised this exercise, in which the lad became a very\r\ngreat proficient), a military coat and cloak, and a farmer's smock,\r\nand placed them in the large hole over the mantel-piece from which the\r\npapers had been taken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they miss the cupboard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will not find these; if\r\nthey find them, they'll tell no tales, except that Father Holt wore more\r\nsuits of clothes than one. All Jesuits do. You know what deceivers we\r\nare, Harry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry was alarmed at the notion that his friend was about to leave him;\r\nbut \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the priest said, \xe2\x80\x9cI may very likely come back with my lord\r\nin a few days. We are to be tolerated; we are not to be persecuted. But\r\nthey may take a fancy to pay a visit at Castlewood ere our return; and,\r\nas gentlemen of my cloth are suspected, they might choose to examine\r\nmy papers, which concern nobody--at least not them.\xe2\x80\x9d And to this day,\r\nwhether the papers in cipher related to politics, or to the affairs of\r\nthat mysterious society whereof Father Holt was a member, his pupil,\r\nHarry Esmond, remains in entire ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his goods, his small wardrobe, &c. Holt left untouched on\r\nhis shelves and in his cupboard, taking down--with a laugh, however--and\r\nflinging into the brazier, where he only half burned them, some\r\ntheological treatises which he had been writing against the English\r\ndivines. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cHenry, my son, you may testify, with a\r\nsafe conscience, that you saw me burning Latin sermons the last time I\r\nwas here before I went away to London; and it will be daybreak directly,\r\nand I must be away before Lockwood is stirring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill not Lockwood let you out, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond asked. Holt laughed; he\r\nwas never more gay or good-humored than when in the midst of action or\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLockwood knows nothing of my being here, mind you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cnor would\r\nyou, you little wretch! had you slept better. You must forget that I\r\nhave been here; and now farewell. Close the door, and go to your own\r\nroom, and don't come out till--stay, why should you not know one secret\r\nmore? I know you will never betray me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the Chaplain's room were two windows; the one looking into the court\r\nfacing westwards to the fountain; the other, a small casement strongly\r\nbarred, and looking on to the green in front of the Hall. This window\r\nwas too high to reach from the ground; but, mounting on a buffet which\r\nstood beneath it, Father Holt showed me how, by pressing on the base\r\nof the window, the whole framework of lead, glass, and iron stanchions\r\ndescended into a cavity worked below, from which it could be drawn and\r\nrestored to its usual place from without; a broken pane being purposely\r\nopen to admit the hand which was to work upon the spring of the machine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am gone,\xe2\x80\x9d Father Holt said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may push away the buffet, so\r\nthat no one may fancy that an exit has been made that way; lock the\r\ndoor; place the key--where shall we put the key?--under 'Chrysostom' on\r\nthe book-shelf; and if any ask for it, say I keep it there, and told you\r\nwhere to find it, if you had need to go to my room. The descent is easy\r\ndown the wall into the ditch; and so, once more farewell, until I see\r\nthee again, my dear son.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this the intrepid Father mounted\r\nthe buffet with great agility and briskness, stepped across the window,\r\nlifting up the bars and framework again from the other side, and only\r\nleaving room for Harry Esmond to stand on tiptoe and kiss his hand\r\nbefore the casement closed, the bars fixing as firmly as ever,\r\nseemingly, in the stone arch overhead. When Father Holt next arrived at\r\nCastlewood, it was by the public gate on horseback; and he never so much\r\nas alluded to the existence of the private issue to Harry, except when\r\nhe had need of a private messenger from within, for which end, no doubt,\r\nhe had instructed his young pupil in the means of quitting the Hall.\r\n\r\nEsmond, young as he was, would have died sooner than betray his friend\r\nand master, as Mr. Holt well knew; for he had tried the boy more than\r\nonce, putting temptations in his way, to see whether he would yield to\r\nthem and confess afterwards, or whether he would resist them, as he did\r\nsometimes, or whether he would lie, which he never did. Holt instructing\r\nthe boy on this point, however, that if to keep silence is not to lie,\r\nas it certainly is not, yet silence is, after all, equivalent to a\r\nnegation--and therefore a downright No, in the interest of justice\r\nor your friend, and in reply to a question that may be prejudicial to\r\neither, is not criminal, but, on the contrary, praiseworthy; and as\r\nlawful a way as the other of eluding a wrongful demand. For instance\r\n(says he), suppose a good citizen, who had seen his Majesty take refuge\r\nthere, had been asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIs King Charles up that oak-tree?\xe2\x80\x9d his duty\r\nwould have been not to say, Yes--so that the Cromwellians should seize\r\nthe king and murder him like his father--but No; his Majesty being\r\nprivate in the tree, and therefore not to be seen there by loyal\r\neyes: all which instruction, in religion and morals, as well as in the\r\nrudiments of the tongues and sciences, the boy took eagerly and with\r\ngratitude from his tutor. When, then, Holt was gone, and told Harry not\r\nto see him, it was as if he had never been. And he had this answer pat\r\nwhen he came to be questioned a few days after.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange was then at Salisbury, as young Esmond learned from\r\nseeing Doctor Tusher in his best cassock (though the roads were\r\nmuddy, and he never was known to wear his silk, only his stuff one,\r\na-horseback), with a great orange cockade in his broad-leafed hat, and\r\nNahum, his clerk, ornamented with a like decoration. The Doctor was\r\nwalking up and down in front of his parsonage, when little Esmond saw\r\nhim, and heard him say he was going to pay his duty to his Highness\r\nthe Prince, as he mounted his pad and rode away with Nahum behind. The\r\nvillage people had orange cockades too, and his friend the blacksmith's\r\nlaughing daughter pinned one into Harry's old hat, which he tore out\r\nindignantly when they bade him to cry \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the Prince of Orange and\r\nthe Protestant religion!\xe2\x80\x9d but the people only laughed, for they liked\r\nthe boy in the village, where his solitary condition moved the general\r\npity, and where he found friendly welcomes and faces in many houses.\r\nFather Holt had many friends there too, for he not only would fight the\r\nblacksmith at theology, never losing his temper, but laughing the whole\r\ntime in his pleasant way; but he cured him of an ague with quinquina,\r\nand was always ready with a kind word for any man that asked it, so that\r\nthey said in the village 'twas a pity the two were Papists.\r\n\r\nThe Director and the Vicar of Castlewood agreed very well; indeed, the\r\nformer was a perfectly-bred gentleman, and it was the latter's business\r\nto agree with everybody. Doctor Tusher and the lady's-maid, his spouse,\r\nhad a boy who was about the age of little Esmond; and there was such a\r\nfriendship between the lads, as propinquity and tolerable kindness and\r\ngood-humor on either side would be pretty sure to occasion. Tom Tusher\r\nwas sent off early, however, to a school in London, whither his father\r\ntook him and a volume of sermons, in the first year of the reign of King\r\nJames; and Tom returned but once, a year afterwards, to Castlewood for\r\nmany years of his scholastic and collegiate life. Thus there was less\r\ndanger to Tom of a perversion of his faith by the Director, who scarce\r\never saw him, than there was to Harry, who constantly was in the Vicar's\r\ncompany; but as long as Harry's religion was his Majesty's, and my\r\nlord's, and my lady's, the Doctor said gravely, it should not be for\r\nhim to disturb or disquiet him: it was far from him to say that his\r\nMajesty's Church was not a branch of the Catholic Church; upon which\r\nFather Holt used, according to his custom, to laugh, and say that the\r\nHoly Church throughout all the world, and the noble Army of Martyrs,\r\nwere very much obliged to the Doctor.\r\n\r\nIt was while Dr. Tusher was away at Salisbury that there came a troop\r\nof dragoons with orange scarfs, and quartered in Castlewood, and some\r\nof them came up to the Hall, where they took possession, robbing nothing\r\nhowever beyond the hen-house and the beer-cellar: and only insisting\r\nupon going through the house and looking for papers. The first room they\r\nasked to look at was Father Holt's room, of which Harry Esmond brought\r\nthe key, and they opened the drawers and the cupboards, and tossed over\r\nthe papers and clothes--but found nothing except his books and clothes,\r\nand the vestments in a box by themselves, with which the dragoons\r\nmade merry, to Harry Esmond's horror. And to the questions which the\r\ngentleman put to Harry, he replied that Father Holt was a very kind man\r\nto him, and a very learned man, and Harry supposed would tell him none\r\nof his secrets if he had any. He was about eleven years old at this\r\ntime, and looked as innocent as boys of his age.\r\n\r\nThe family were away more than six months, and when they returned\r\nthey were in the deepest state of dejection, for King James had been\r\nbanished, the Prince of Orange was on the throne, and the direst\r\npersecutions of those of the Catholic faith were apprehended by my\r\nlady, who said she did not believe that there was a word of truth in the\r\npromises of toleration that Dutch monster made, or in a single word the\r\nperjured wretch said. My lord and lady were in a manner prisoners in\r\ntheir own house; so her ladyship gave the little page to know, who was\r\nby this time growing of an age to understand what was passing about him,\r\nand something of the characters of the people he lived with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are prisoners,\xe2\x80\x9d says she; \xe2\x80\x9cin everything but chains, we are\r\nprisoners. Let them come, let them consign me to dungeons, or strike off\r\nmy head from this poor little throat\xe2\x80\x9d (and she clasped it in her long\r\nfingers). \xe2\x80\x9cThe blood of the Esmonds will always flow freely for their\r\nkings. We are not like the Churchills--the Judases, who kiss their\r\nmaster and betray him. We know how to suffer, how even to forgive in the\r\nroyal cause\xe2\x80\x9d (no doubt it was to that fatal business of losing the place\r\nof Groom of the Posset to which her ladyship alluded, as she did half\r\na dozen times in the day). \xe2\x80\x9cLet the tyrant of Orange bring his rack and\r\nhis odious Dutch tortures--the beast! the wretch! I spit upon him and\r\ndefy him. Cheerfully will I lay this head upon the block; cheerfully\r\nwill I accompany my lord to the scaffold: we will cry 'God save\r\nKing James!' with our dying breath, and smile in the face of the\r\nexecutioner.\xe2\x80\x9d And she told her page, a hundred times at least, of the\r\nparticulars of the last interview which she had with his Majesty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI flung myself before my liege's feet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cat Salisbury.\r\nI devoted myself--my husband--my house, to his cause. Perhaps he\r\nremembered old times, when Isabella Esmond was young and fair; perhaps\r\nhe recalled the day when 'twas not I that knelt--at least he spoke to me\r\nwith a voice that reminded ME of days gone by. 'Egad!' said his Majesty,\r\n'you should go to the Prince of Orange; if you want anything.' 'No,\r\nsire,' I replied, 'I would not kneel to a Usurper; the Esmond that would\r\nhave served your Majesty will never be groom to a traitor's posset.' The\r\nroyal exile smiled, even in the midst of his misfortune; he deigned to\r\nraise me with words of consolation. The Viscount, my husband, himself,\r\ncould not be angry at the august salute with which he honored me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe public misfortune had the effect of making my lord and his lady\r\nbetter friends than they ever had been since their courtship. My\r\nlord Viscount had shown both loyalty and spirit, when these were rare\r\nqualities in the dispirited party about the King; and the praise he got\r\nelevated him not a little in his wife's good opinion, and perhaps in his\r\nown. He wakened up from the listless and supine life which he had been\r\nleading; was always riding to and fro in consultation with this friend\r\nor that of the King's; the page of course knowing little of his doings,\r\nbut remarking only his greater cheerfulness and altered demeanor.\r\n\r\nFather Holt came to the Hall constantly, but officiated no longer openly\r\nas chaplain; he was always fetching and carrying: strangers, military\r\nand ecclesiastic (Harry knew the latter, though they came in all sorts\r\nof disguises), were continually arriving and departing. My lord made\r\nlong absences and sudden reappearances, using sometimes the means of\r\nexit which Father Holt had employed, though how often the little window\r\nin the Chaplain's room let in or let out my lord and his friends, Harry\r\ncould not tell. He stoutly kept his promise to the Father of not prying,\r\nand if at midnight from his little room he heard noises of persons\r\nstirring in the next chamber, he turned round to the wall, and hid his\r\ncuriosity under his pillow until it fell asleep. Of course he could\r\nnot help remarking that the priest's journeys were constant, and\r\nunderstanding by a hundred signs that some active though secret business\r\nemployed him: what this was may pretty well be guessed by what soon\r\nhappened to my lord.\r\n\r\nNo garrison or watch was put into Castlewood when my lord came back, but\r\na Guard was in the village; and one or other of them was always on the\r\nGreen keeping a look-out on our great gate, and those who went out and\r\nin. Lockwood said that at night especially every person who came in or\r\nwent out was watched by the outlying sentries. 'Twas lucky that we had\r\na gate which their Worships knew nothing about. My lord and Father Holt\r\nmust have made constant journeys at night: once or twice little Harry\r\nacted as their messenger and discreet little aide-de-camp. He remembers\r\nhe was bidden to go into the village with his fishing-rod, enter certain\r\nhouses, ask for a drink of water, and tell the good man, \xe2\x80\x9cThere would be\r\na horse-market at Newbury next Thursday,\xe2\x80\x9d and so carry the same message\r\non to the next house on his list.\r\n\r\nHe did not know what the message meant at the time, nor what was\r\nhappening: which may as well, however, for clearness' sake, be explained\r\nhere. The Prince of Orange being gone to Ireland, where the King was\r\nready to meet him with a great army, it was determined that a great\r\nrising of his Majesty's party should take place in this country; and my\r\nlord was to head the force in our county. Of late he had taken a greater\r\nlead in affairs than before, having the indefatigable Mr. Holt at his\r\nelbow, and my Lady Viscountess strongly urging him on; and my Lord\r\nSark being in the Tower a prisoner, and Sir Wilmot Crawley, of Queen's\r\nCrawley, having gone over to the Prince of Orange's side--my lord became\r\nthe most considerable person in our part of the county for the affairs\r\nof the King.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the regiment of Scots Grays and Dragoons, then\r\nquartered at Newbury, should declare for the King on a certain day, when\r\nlikewise the gentry affected to his Majesty's cause were to come in with\r\ntheir tenants and adherents to Newbury, march upon the Dutch troops\r\nat Reading under Ginckel; and, these overthrown, and their indomitable\r\nlittle master away in Ireland, 'twas thought that our side might move on\r\nLondon itself, and a confident victory was predicted for the King.\r\n\r\nAs these great matters were in agitation, my lord lost his listless\r\nmanner and seemed to gain health; my lady did not scold him, Mr. Holt\r\ncame to and fro, busy always; and little Harry longed to have been a few\r\ninches taller, that he might draw a sword in this good cause.\r\n\r\nOne day, it must have been about the month of July, 1690, my lord, in\r\na great horseman's coat, under which Harry could see the shining of a\r\nsteel breastplate he had on, called little Harry to him, put the hair\r\noff the child's forehead, and kissed him, and bade God bless him in such\r\nan affectionate way as he never had used before. Father Holt blessed him\r\ntoo, and then they took leave of my Lady Viscountess, who came from her\r\napartment with a pocket-handkerchief to her eyes, and her gentlewoman\r\nand Mrs. Tusher supporting her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to--to ride,\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that I might come too--but in my situation I am forbidden horse\r\nexercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe kiss my Lady Marchioness's hand,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Holt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, God speed you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, stepping up and embracing my lord in\r\na grand manner. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Holt, I ask your blessing:\xe2\x80\x9d and she knelt down for\r\nthat, whilst Mrs. Tusher tossed her head up.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt gave the same benediction to the little page, who went down\r\nand held my lord's stirrups for him to mount; there were two servants\r\nwaiting there too--and they rode out of Castlewood gate.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed the bridge, Harry could see an officer in scarlet ride\r\nup touching his hat, and address my lord.\r\n\r\nThe party stopped, and came to some parley or discussion, which\r\npresently ended, my lord putting his horse into a canter after taking\r\noff his hat and making a bow to the officer, who rode alongside him step\r\nfor step: the trooper accompanying him falling back, and riding with my\r\nlord's two men. They cantered over the Green, and behind the elms (my\r\nlord waving his hand, Harry thought), and so they disappeared. That\r\nevening we had a great panic, the cow-boy coming at milking-time riding\r\none of our horses, which he had found grazing at the outer park-wall.\r\n\r\nAll night my Lady Viscountess was in a very quiet and subdued mood.\r\nShe scarce found fault with anybody; she played at cards for six hours;\r\nlittle page Esmond went to sleep. He prayed for my lord and the good\r\ncause before closing his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was quite in the gray of the morning when the porter's bell rang, and\r\nold Lockwood, waking up, let in one of my lord's servants, who had gone\r\nwith him in the morning, and who returned with a melancholy story. The\r\nofficer who rode up to my lord had, it appeared, said to him, that it\r\nwas his duty to inform his lordship that he was not under arrest, but\r\nunder surveillance, and to request him not to ride abroad that day.\r\n\r\nMy lord replied that riding was good for his health, that if the Captain\r\nchose to accompany him he was welcome; and it was then that he made a\r\nbow, and they cantered away together.\r\n\r\nWhen he came on to Wansey Down, my lord all of a sudden pulled up, and\r\nthe party came to a halt at the cross-way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d says he to the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are four to two; will you be so kind\r\nas to take that road, and leave me go mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour road is mine, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen--\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord; but he had no time to say more, for the officer,\r\ndrawing a pistol, snapped it at his lordship; as at the same moment\r\nFather Holt, drawing a pistol, shot the officer through the head. It was\r\ndone, and the man dead in an instant of time. The orderly, gazing at the\r\nofficer, looked seared for a moment, and galloped away for his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire! fire!\xe2\x80\x9d cries out Father Holt, sending another shot after the\r\ntrooper, but the two servants were too much surprised to use their\r\npieces, and my lord calling to them to hold their hands, the fellow got\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Holt, qui pensait a tout,\xe2\x80\x9d says Blaise, \xe2\x80\x9cgets off his horse,\r\nexamines the pockets of the dead officer for papers, gives his money to\r\nus two, and says, 'The wine is drawn, M. le Marquis,'--why did he say\r\nMarquis to M. le Vicomte?--'we must drink it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor gentleman's horse was a better one than that I rode,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Blaise continues; \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Holt bids me get on him, and so I gave a cut to\r\nWhitefoot, and she trotted home. We rode on towards Newbury; we heard\r\nfiring towards midday: at two o'clock a horseman comes up to us as we\r\nwere giving our cattle water at an inn--and says, 'All is done! The\r\nEcossais declared an hour too soon--General Ginckel was down upon them.'\r\nThe whole thing was at an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And we've shot an officer on duty, and let his orderly escape,' says\r\nmy lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Blaise,' says Mr. Holt, writing two lines on his table-book, one for\r\nmy lady and one for you, Master Harry; 'you must go back to Castlewood,\r\nand deliver these,' and behold me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he gave Harry the two papers. He read that to himself, which only\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cBurn the papers in the cupboard, burn this. You know nothing\r\nabout anything.\xe2\x80\x9d Harry read this, ran up stairs to his mistress's\r\napartment, where her gentlewoman slept near to the door, made her bring\r\na light and wake my lady, into whose hands he gave the paper. She was a\r\nwonderful object to look at in her night attire, nor had Harry ever seen\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had the paper in her hand, Harry stepped back to the\r\nChaplain's room, opened the secret cupboard over the fireplace, burned\r\nall the papers in it, and, as he had seen the priest do before, took\r\ndown one of his reverence's manuscript sermons, and half burnt that\r\nin the brazier. By the time the papers were quite destroyed it was\r\ndaylight. Harry ran back to his mistress again. Her gentlewoman ushered\r\nhim again into her ladyship's chamber; she told him (from behind her\r\nnuptial curtains) to bid the coach be got ready, and that she would ride\r\naway anon.\r\n\r\nBut the mysteries of her ladyship's toilet were as awfully long on this\r\nday as on any other, and, long after the coach was ready, my lady was\r\nstill attiring herself. And just as the Viscountess stepped forth from\r\nher room, ready for departure, young John Lockwood comes running up\r\nfrom the village with news that a lawyer, three officers, and twenty or\r\nfour-and-twenty soldiers, were marching thence upon the house. John had\r\nbut two minutes the start of them, and, ere he had well told his story,\r\nthe troop rode into our court-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE OF THE PLOTS.--THE DEATH OF THOMAS, THIRD VISCOUNT OF\r\nCASTLEWOOD; AND THE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS VISCOUNTESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first my lady was for dying like Mary, Queen of Scots (to whom she\r\nfancied she bore a resemblance in beauty), and, stroking her scraggy\r\nneck, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThey will find Isabel of Castlewood is equal to her fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Her gentlewoman, Victoire, persuaded her that her prudent course was,\r\nas she could not fly, to receive the troops as though she suspected\r\nnothing, and that her chamber was the best place wherein to await them.\r\nSo her black Japan casket, which Harry was to carry to the coach, was\r\ntaken back to her ladyship's chamber, whither the maid and mistress\r\nretired. Victoire came out presently, bidding the page to say her\r\nladyship was ill, confined to her bed with the rheumatism.\r\n\r\nBy this time the soldiers had reached Castlewood. Harry Esmond saw\r\nthem from the window of the tapestry parlor; a couple of sentinels were\r\nposted at the gate--a half-dozen more walked towards the stable; and\r\nsome others, preceded by their commander, and a man in black, a lawyer\r\nprobably, were conducted by one of the servants to the stair leading up\r\nto the part of the house which my lord and lady inhabited.\r\n\r\nSo the Captain, a handsome kind man, and the lawyer, came through the\r\nante-room to the tapestry parlor, and where now was nobody but young\r\nHarry Esmond, the page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your mistress, little man,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we\r\nmust speak to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress is ill a-bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat complaint has she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain.\r\n\r\nThe boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe rheumatism!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRheumatism! that's a sad complaint,\xe2\x80\x9d continues the good-natured\r\nCaptain; \xe2\x80\x9cand the coach is in the yard to fetch the Doctor, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know,\xe2\x80\x9d says the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long has her ladyship been ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know,\xe2\x80\x9d says the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did my lord go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Father Holt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Mr. Holt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd which way did they travel?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey travelled without me,\xe2\x80\x9d says the page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must see Lady Castlewood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have orders that nobody goes in to her ladyship--she is sick,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nthe page; but at this moment Victoire came out. \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d says she; and,\r\nas if not knowing that any one was near, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's this noise?\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this gentleman the Doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff! we must see Lady Castlewood,\xe2\x80\x9d says the lawyer, pushing by.\r\n\r\nThe curtains of her ladyship's room were down, and the chamber dark,\r\nand she was in bed with a nightcap on her head, and propped up by her\r\npillows, looking none the less ghastly because of the red which was\r\nstill on her cheeks, and which she could not afford to forego.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the Doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no use with this deception, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Westbury said (for\r\nso he was named). \xe2\x80\x9cMy duty is to arrest the person of Thomas, Viscount\r\nCastlewood, a nonjuring peer--of Robert Tusher, Vicar of Castlewood--and\r\nHenry Holt, known under various other names and designations, a Jesuit\r\npriest, who officiated as chaplain here in the late king's time, and is\r\nnow at the head of the conspiracy which was about to break out in this\r\ncountry against the authority of their Majesties King William and Queen\r\nMary--and my orders are to search the house for such papers or traces of\r\nthe conspiracy as may be found here. Your ladyship will please give me\r\nyour keys, and it will be as well for yourself that you should help us,\r\nin every way, in our search.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, sir, that I have the rheumatism, and cannot move,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe lady, looking uncommonly ghastly as she sat up in her bed, where,\r\nhowever, she had had her cheeks painted, and a new cap put on, so that\r\nshe might at least look her best when the officers came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take leave to place a sentinel in the chamber, so that your\r\nladyship, in case you should wish to rise, may have an arm to lean on,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Captain Westbury said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour woman will show me where I am to look;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nMadame Victoire, chattering in her half French and half English jargon,\r\nopened while the Captain examined one drawer after another; but, as\r\nHarry Esmond thought, rather carelessly, with a smile on his face, as if\r\nhe was only conducting the examination for form's sake.\r\n\r\nBefore one of the cupboards Victoire flung herself down, stretching out\r\nher arms, and, with a piercing shriek, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cNon, jamais, monsieur\r\nl'officier! Jamais! I will rather die than let you see this wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Captain Westbury would open it, still with a smile on his face,\r\nwhich, when the box was opened, turned into a fair burst of laughter.\r\nIt contained--not papers regarding the conspiracy--but my lady's wigs,\r\nwashes, and rouge-pots, and Victoire said men were monsters, as the\r\nCaptain went on with his perquisition. He tapped the back to see whether\r\nor no it was hollow, and as he thrust his hands into the cupboard, my\r\nlady from her bed called out, with a voice that did not sound like that\r\nof a very sick woman, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it your commission to insult ladies as well as\r\nto arrest gentlemen, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese articles are only dangerous when worn by your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nCaptain said, with a low bow, and a mock grin of politeness. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nfound nothing which concerns the Government as yet--only the weapons\r\nwith which beauty is authorized to kill,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, pointing to a wig\r\nwith his sword-tip. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must now proceed to search the rest of the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going to leave that wretch in the room with me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my\r\nlady, pointing to the soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do, madam? Somebody you must have to smooth your pillow and\r\nbring your medicine--permit me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed out my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, if you are too ill to leave the bed,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain then said,\r\nrather sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cI must have in four of my men to lift you off in the\r\nsheet. I must examine this bed, in a word; papers may be hidden in a bed\r\nas elsewhere; we know that very well and * * *.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere it was her ladyship's turn to shriek, for the Captain, with his\r\nfist shaking the pillows and bolsters, at last came to \xe2\x80\x9cburn\xe2\x80\x9d as they\r\nsay in the play of forfeits, and wrenching away one of the pillows,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cLook! did not I tell you so? Here is a pillow stuffed with\r\npaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome villain has betrayed us,\xe2\x80\x9d cried out my lady, sitting up in the\r\nbed, showing herself full dressed under her night-rail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now your ladyship can move, I am sure; permit me to give you my\r\nhand to rise. You will have to travel for some distance, as far as\r\nHexton Castle to-night. Will you have your coach? Your woman shall\r\nattend you if you like--and the japan-box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir! you don't strike a MAN when he is down,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady, with some\r\ndignity: \xe2\x80\x9ccan you not spare a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship must please to rise, and let me search the bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nCaptain; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no more time to lose in bandying talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, without more ado, the gaunt old woman got up. Harry Esmond\r\nrecollected to the end of his life that figure, with the brocade dress\r\nand the white night-rail, and the gold-clocked red stockings, and white\r\nred-heeled shoes, sitting up in the bed, and stepping down from it. The\r\ntrunks were ready packed for departure in her ante-room, and the horses\r\nready harnessed in the stable: about all which the Captain seemed to\r\nknow, by information got from some quarter or other; and whence Esmond\r\ncould make a pretty shrewd guess in after-times, when Dr. Tusher\r\ncomplained that King William's government had basely treated him for\r\nservices done in that cause.\r\n\r\nAnd here he may relate, though he was then too young to know all that\r\nwas happening, what the papers contained, of which Captain Westbury had\r\nmade a seizure, and which papers had been transferred from the japan-box\r\nto the bed when the officers arrived.\r\n\r\nThere was a list of gentlemen of the county in Father Holt's hand\r\nwriting--Mr. Freeman's (King James's) friends--a similar paper being\r\nfound among those of Sir John Fenwick and Mr. Coplestone, who suffered\r\ndeath for this conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThere was a patent conferring the title of Marquis of Esmond on my\r\nLord Castlewood and the heirs-male of his body; his appointment as\r\nLord-Lieutenant of the County, and Major-General.*\r\n\r\n     * To have this rank of Marquis restored in the family had\r\n     always been my Lady Viscountess's ambition; and her old\r\n     maiden aunt, Barbara Topham, the goldsmith's daughter, dying\r\n     about this time, and leaving all her property to Lady\r\n     Castlewood, I have heard that her ladyship sent almost the\r\n     whole of the money to King James, a proceeding which so\r\n     irritated my Lord Castlewood that he actually went to the\r\n     parish church, and was only appeased by the Marquis's title\r\n     which his exiled Majesty sent to him in return for the\r\n     15,000L. his faithful subject lent him.\r\n\r\nThere were various letters from the nobility and gentry, some ardent\r\nand some doubtful, in the King's service; and (very luckily for him) two\r\nletters concerning Colonel Francis Esmond: one from Father Holt, which\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been to see this Colonel at his house at Walcote, near to\r\nWells, where he resides since the King's departure, and pressed him very\r\neagerly in Mr. Freeman's cause, showing him the great advantage he would\r\nhave by trading with that merchant, offering him large premiums there as\r\nagreed between us. But he says no: he considers Mr. Freeman the head of\r\nthe firm, will never trade against him or embark with any other trading\r\ncompany, but considers his duty was done when Mr. Freeman left England.\r\nThis Colonel seems to care more for his wife and his beagles than for\r\naffairs. He asked me much about young H. E., 'that bastard,' as he\r\ncalled him; doubting my lord's intentions respecting him. I reassured\r\nhim on this head, stating what I knew of the lad, and our intentions\r\nrespecting him, but with regard to Freeman he was inflexible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd another letter was from Colonel Esmond to his kinsman, to say that\r\none Captain Holton had been with him offering him large bribes to join,\r\nYOU KNOW WHO, and saying that the head of the house of Castlewood was\r\ndeeply engaged in that quarter. But for his part he had broke his\r\nsword when the K. left the country, and would never again fight in that\r\nquarrel. The P. of O. was a man, at least, of a noble courage, and his\r\nduty, and, as he thought, every Englishman's, was to keep the country\r\nquiet, and the French out of it: and, in fine, that he would have\r\nnothing to do with the scheme.\r\n\r\nOf the existence of these two letters and the contents of the pillow,\r\nColonel Frank Esmond, who became Viscount Castlewood, told Henry\r\nEsmond afterwards, when the letters were shown to his lordship, who\r\ncongratulated himself, as he had good reason, that he had not joined\r\nin the scheme which proved so fatal to many concerned in it. But,\r\nnaturally, the lad knew little about these circumstances when they\r\nhappened under his eyes: only being aware that his patron and his\r\nmistress were in some trouble, which had caused the flight of the one\r\nand the apprehension of the other by the officers of King William.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the papers effected, the gentlemen did not pursue their\r\nfurther search through Castlewood House very rigorously. They examined\r\nMr. Holt's room, being led thither by his pupil, who showed, as the\r\nFather had bidden him, the place where the key of his chamber lay,\r\nopened the door for the gentlemen, and conducted them into the room.\r\n\r\nWhen the gentlemen came to the half-burned papers in the brazier, they\r\nexamined them eagerly enough, and their young guide was a little amused\r\nat their perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are these?\xe2\x80\x9d says one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey're written in a foreign language,\xe2\x80\x9d says the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you\r\nlaughing at, little whelp?\xe2\x80\x9d adds he, turning round as he saw the boy\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Holt said they were sermons,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry said, \xe2\x80\x9cand bade me to burn\r\nthem;\xe2\x80\x9d which indeed was true of those papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSermons indeed--it's treason, I would lay a wager,\xe2\x80\x9d cries the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgad! it's Greek to me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Captain Westbury. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you read it,\r\nlittle boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, a little,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen read, and read in English, sir, on your peril,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer.\r\nAnd Harry began to translate:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHath not one of your own writers said, 'The children of Adam are now\r\nlaboring as much as he himself ever did, about the tree of the knowledge\r\nof good and evil, shaking the boughs thereof, and seeking the fruit,\r\nbeing for the most part unmindful of the tree of life.' Oh blind\r\ngeneration! 'tis this tree of knowledge to which the serpent has led\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x9d--and here the boy was obliged to stop, the rest of the page being\r\ncharred by the fire: and asked of the lawyer--\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go on, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer said--\xe2\x80\x9cThis boy is deeper than he seems: who knows that he is\r\nnot laughing at us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's have in Dick the Scholar,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Captain Westbury, laughing: and\r\nhe called to a trooper out of the window--\xe2\x80\x9cHo, Dick, come in here and\r\nconstrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA thick-set soldier, with a square good-humored face, came in at the\r\nsummons, saluting his officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us what is this, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d says the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Steele, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cI may be Dick for my\r\nfriends, but I don't name gentlemen of your cloth amongst them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, Steele.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Steele, sir, if you please. When you address a gentleman of his\r\nMajesty's Horse Guards, be pleased not to be so familiar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should you? I take it you are not accustomed to meet with\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d says the trooper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold thy prate, and read that bit of paper,\xe2\x80\x9d says Westbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis Latin,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dick, glancing at it, and again saluting his officer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand from a sermon of Mr. Cudworth's,\xe2\x80\x9d and he translated the words\r\npretty much as Henry Esmond had rendered them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a young scholar you are,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain to the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepend on't, he knows more than he tells,\xe2\x80\x9d says the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\r\nwill pack him off in the coach with old Jezebel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor construing a bit of Latin?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, very good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would as lief go there as anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry Esmond said, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthere is nobody to care for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere must have been something touching in the child's voice, or in\r\nthis description of his solitude--for the Captain looked at him very\r\ngood-naturedly, and the trooper, called Steele, put his hand kindly on\r\nthe lad's head, and said some words in the Latin tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d says the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, ask Dick himself,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Captain Westbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was not ignorant of misfortune myself, and had learned to\r\nsuccor the miserable, and that's not YOUR trade, Mr. Sheepskin,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe trooper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better leave Dick the Scholar alone, Mr. Corbet,\xe2\x80\x9d the Captain\r\nsaid. And Harry Esmond, always touched by a kind face and kind word,\r\nfelt very grateful to this good-natured champion.\r\n\r\nThe horses were by this time harnessed to the coach; and the Countess\r\nand Victoire came down and were put into the vehicle. This woman, who\r\nquarrelled with Harry Esmond all day, was melted at parting with him,\r\nand called him \xe2\x80\x9cdear angel,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpoor infant,\xe2\x80\x9d and a hundred other\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe Viscountess, giving him her lean hand to kiss, bade him always be\r\nfaithful to the house of Esmond. \xe2\x80\x9cIf evil should happen to my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says she, \xe2\x80\x9chis SUCCESSOR, I trust, will be found, and give you\r\nprotection. Situated as I am, they will not dare wreak their vengeance\r\non me NOW.\xe2\x80\x9d And she kissed a medal she wore with great fervor, and\r\nHenry Esmond knew not in the least what her meaning was; but hath since\r\nlearned that, old as she was, she was for ever expecting, by the good\r\noffices of saints and relics, to have an heir to the title of Esmond.\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond was too young to have been introduced into the secrets\r\nof politics in which his patrons were implicated; for they put but few\r\nquestions to the boy (who was little of stature, and looked much younger\r\nthan his age), and such questions as they put he answered cautiously\r\nenough, and professing even more ignorance than he had, for which his\r\nexaminers willingly enough gave him credit. He did not say a word about\r\nthe window or the cupboard over the fireplace; and these secrets quite\r\nescaped the eyes of the searchers.\r\n\r\nSo then my lady was consigned to her coach, and sent off to Hexton, with\r\nher woman and the man of law to bear her company, a couple of troopers\r\nriding on either side of the coach. And Harry was left behind at the\r\nHall, belonging as it were to nobody, and quite alone in the world.\r\nThe captain and a guard of men remained in possession there; and the\r\nsoldiers, who were very good-natured and kind, ate my lord's mutton and\r\ndrank his wine, and made themselves comfortable, as they well might do\r\nin such pleasant quarters.\r\n\r\nThe captains had their dinner served in my lord's tapestry parlor, and\r\npoor little Harry thought his duty was to wait upon Captain Westbury's\r\nchair, as his custom had been to serve his lord when he sat there.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Countess, Dick the Scholar took Harry Esmond\r\nunder his special protection, and would examine him in his humanities\r\nand talk to him both of French and Latin, in which tongues the lad\r\nfound, and his new friend was willing enough to acknowledge, that he was\r\neven more proficient than Scholar Dick. Hearing that he had learned them\r\nfrom a Jesuit, in the praise of whom and whose goodness Harry was never\r\ntired of speaking, Dick, rather to the boy's surprise, who began to have\r\nan early shrewdness, like many children bred up alone, showed a great\r\ndeal of theological science, and knowledge of the points at issue\r\nbetween the two churches; so that he and Harry would have hours of\r\ncontroversy together, in which the boy was certainly worsted by the\r\narguments of this singular trooper. \xe2\x80\x9cI am no common soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick would\r\nsay, and indeed it was easy to see by his learning, breeding, and\r\nmany accomplishments, that he was not. \xe2\x80\x9cI am of one of the most ancient\r\nfamilies in the empire; I have had my education at a famous school,\r\nand a famous university; I learned my first rudiments of Latin near to\r\nSmithfield, in London, where the martyrs were roasted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hanged as many of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Harry; \xe2\x80\x9cand, for the matter of\r\npersecution, Father Holt told me that a young gentleman of Edinburgh,\r\neighteen years of age, student at the college there, was hanged for\r\nheresy only last year, though he recanted, and solemnly asked pardon for\r\nhis errors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith! there has been too much persecution on both sides: but 'twas you\r\ntaught us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, 'twas the Pagans began it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lad, and began to instance\r\na number of saints of the Church, from the proto-martyr downwards--\xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\none's fire went out under him: that one's oil cooled in the caldron: at\r\na third holy head the executioner chopped three times and it would not\r\ncome off. Show us martyrs in YOUR church for whom such miracles have\r\nbeen done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d says the trooper gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthe miracles of the first three\r\ncenturies belong to my Church as well as yours, Master Papist,\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nadded, with something of a smile upon his countenance, and a queer look\r\nat Harry--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, my little catechiser, I have sometimes thought about\r\nthose miracles, that there was not much good in them, since the victim's\r\nhead always finished by coming off at the third or fourth chop, and the\r\ncaldron, if it did not boil one day, boiled the next. Howbeit, in our\r\ntimes, the Church has lost that questionable advantage of respites.\r\nThere never was a shower to put out Ridley's fire, nor an angel to turn\r\nthe edge of Campion's axe. The rack tore the limbs of Southwell\r\nthe Jesuit and Sympson the Protestant alike. For faith, everywhere\r\nmultitudes die willingly enough. I have read in Monsieur Rycaut's\r\n'History of the Turks,' of thousands of Mahomet's followers rushing\r\nupon death in battle as upon certain Paradise; and in the great Mogul's\r\ndominions people fling themselves by hundreds under the cars of the\r\nidols annually, and the widows burn themselves on their husbands'\r\nbodies, as 'tis well known. 'Tis not the dying for a faith that's so\r\nhard, Master Harry--every man of every nation has done that--'tis the\r\nliving up to it that is difficult, as I know to my cost,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with\r\na sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd ah!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cmy poor lad, I am not strong enough to\r\nconvince thee by my life--though to die for my religion would give me\r\nthe greatest of joys--but I had a dear friend in Magdalen College in\r\nOxford; I wish Joe Addison were here to convince thee, as he quickly\r\ncould--for I think he's a match for the whole College of Jesuits; and\r\nwhat's more, in his life too. In that very sermon of Dr. Cudworth's\r\nwhich your priest was quoting from, and which suffered martydom in the\r\nbrazier,\xe2\x80\x9d--Dick added with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI had a thought of wearing the\r\nblack coat (but was ashamed of my life, you see, and took to this sorry\r\nred one); I have often thought of Joe Addison--Dr. Cudworth says,\r\n'A good conscience is the best looking-glass of heaven'--and there's\r\nserenity in my friend's face which always reflects it--I wish you could\r\nsee him, Harry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he do you a great deal of good?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lad, simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might have done,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other--\xe2\x80\x9cat least he taught me to see and\r\napprove better things. 'Tis my own fault, deteriora sequi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem very good,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm not what I seem, alas!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the trooper--and indeed, as it\r\nturned out, poor Dick told the truth--for that very night, at supper\r\nin the hall, where the gentlemen of the troop took their repasts,\r\nand passed most part of their days dicing and smoking of tobacco, and\r\nsinging and cursing, over the Castlewood ale--Harry Esmond found Dick\r\nthe Scholar in a woful state of drunkenness. He hiccupped out a sermon\r\nand his laughing companions bade him sing a hymn, on which Dick,\r\nswearing he would run the scoundrel through the body who insulted his\r\nreligion, made for his sword, which was hanging on the wall, and fell\r\ndown flat on the floor under it, saying to Harry, who ran forward to\r\nhelp him, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, little Papist, I wish Joseph Addison was here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough the troopers of the King's Life-Guards were all gentlemen, yet\r\nthe rest of the gentlemen seemed ignorant and vulgar boors to Harry\r\nEsmond, with the exception of this good-natured Corporal Steele the\r\nScholar, and Captain Westbury and Lieutenant Trant, who were always\r\nkind to the lad. They remained for some weeks or months encamped in\r\nCastlewood, and Harry learned from them, from time to time, how the lady\r\nat Hexton Castle was treated, and the particulars of her confinement\r\nthere. 'Tis known that King William was disposed to deal very leniently\r\nwith the gentry who remained faithful to the old King's cause; and no\r\nprince usurping a crown, as his enemies said he did, (righteously\r\ntaking it, as I think now,) ever caused less blood to be shed. As for\r\nwomen-conspirators, he kept spies on the least dangerous, and locked up\r\nthe others. Lady Castlewood had the best rooms in Hexton Castle, and the\r\ngaoler's garden to walk in; and though she repeatedly desired to be led\r\nout to execution, like Mary Queen of Scots, there never was any thought\r\nof taking her painted old head off, or any desire to do aught but keep\r\nher person in security.\r\n\r\nAnd it appeared she found that some were friends in her misfortune, whom\r\nshe had, in her prosperity, considered as her worst enemies. Colonel\r\nFrancis Esmond, my lord's cousin and her ladyship's, who had married the\r\nDean of Winchester's daughter, and, since King James's departure out of\r\nEngland, had lived not very far away from Hexton town, hearing of his\r\nkinswoman's strait, and being friends with Colonel Brice, commanding for\r\nKing William in Hexton, and with the Church dignitaries there, came\r\nto visit her ladyship in prison, offering to his uncle's daughter any\r\nfriendly services which lay in his power. And he brought his lady and\r\nlittle daughter to see the prisoner, to the latter of whom, a child\r\nof great beauty and many winning ways, the old Viscountess took not\r\na little liking, although between her ladyship and the child's mother\r\nthere was little more love than formerly. There are some injuries which\r\nwomen never forgive one another; and Madam Francis Esmond, in marrying\r\nher cousin, had done one of those irretrievable wrongs to Lady\r\nCastlewood. But as she was now humiliated, and in misfortune, Madam\r\nFrancis could allow a truce to her enmity, and could be kind for a\r\nwhile, at least, to her husband's discarded mistress. So the little\r\nBeatrix, her daughter, was permitted often to go and visit the\r\nimprisoned Viscountess, who, in so far as the child and its father\r\nwere concerned, got to abate in her anger towards that branch of the\r\nCastlewood family. And the letters of Colonel Esmond coming to light,\r\nas has been said, and his conduct being known to the King's council, the\r\nColonel was put in a better position with the existing government than\r\nhe had ever before been; any suspicions regarding his loyalty were\r\nentirely done away; and so he was enabled to be of more service to his\r\nkinswoman than he could otherwise have been.\r\n\r\nAnd now there befell an event by which this lady recovered her liberty,\r\nand the house of Castlewood got a new owner, and fatherless little Harry\r\nEsmond a new and most kind protector and friend. Whatever that secret\r\nwas which Harry was to hear from my lord, the boy never heard it; for\r\nthat night when Father Holt arrived, and carried my lord away with him,\r\nwas the last on which Harry ever saw his patron. What happened to my\r\nlord may be briefly told here. Having found the horses at the place\r\nwhere they were lying, my lord and Father Holt rode together to\r\nChatteris, where they had temporary refuge with one of the Father's\r\npenitents in that city; but the pursuit being hot for them, and the\r\nreward for the apprehension of one or the other considerable, it was\r\ndeemed advisable that they should separate; and the priest betook\r\nhimself to other places of retreat known to him, whilst my lord passed\r\nover from Bristol into Ireland, in which kingdom King James had a court\r\nand an army. My lord was but a small addition to this; bringing, indeed,\r\nonly his sword and the few pieces in his pocket; but the King received\r\nhim with some kindness and distinction in spite of his poor plight,\r\nconfirmed him in his new title of Marquis, gave him a regiment, and\r\npromised him further promotion. But titles or promotion were not to\r\nbenefit him now. My lord was wounded at the fatal battle of the Boyne,\r\nflying from which field (long after his master had set him an example)\r\nhe lay for a while concealed in the marshy country near to the town of\r\nTrim, and more from catarrh and fever caught in the bogs than from the\r\nsteel of the enemy in the battle, sank and died. May the earth lie light\r\nupon Thomas of Castlewood! He who writes this must speak in charity,\r\nthough this lord did him and his two grievous wrongs: for one of these\r\nhe would have made amends, perhaps, had life been spared him; but the\r\nother lay beyond his power to repair, though 'tis to be hoped that a\r\ngreater Power than a priest has absolved him of it. He got the comfort\r\nof this absolution, too, such as it was: a priest of Trim writing a\r\nletter to my lady to inform her of this calamity.\r\n\r\nBut in those days letters were slow of travelling, and our priest's took\r\ntwo months or more on its journey from Ireland to England: where, when\r\nit did arrive, it did not find my lady at her own house; she was at the\r\nKing's house of Hexton Castle when the letter came to Castlewood, but it\r\nwas opened for all that by the officer in command there.\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond well remembered the receipt of this letter, which Lockwood\r\nbrought in as Captain Westbury and Lieutenant Trant were on the green\r\nplaying at bowls, young Esmond looking on at the sport, or reading his\r\nbook in the arbor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere's news for Frank Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d says Captain Westbury; \xe2\x80\x9cHarry, did you\r\never see Colonel Esmond?\xe2\x80\x9d And Captain Westbury looked very hard at the\r\nboy as he spoke.\r\n\r\nHarry said he had seen him but once when he was at Hexton, at the ball\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he say anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said what I don't care to repeat,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry answered. For he was now\r\ntwelve years of age: he knew what his birth was, and the disgrace of\r\nit; and he felt no love towards the man who had most likely stained his\r\nmother's honor and his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you love my Lord Castlewood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wait until I know my mother, sir, to say,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy answered, his eyes\r\nfilling with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething has happened to Lord Castlewood,\xe2\x80\x9d Captain Westbury said in a\r\nvery grave tone--\xe2\x80\x9csomething which must happen to us all. He is dead of a\r\nwound received at the Boyne, fighting for King James.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad my lord fought for the right cause,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was better to meet death on the field like a man, than face it on\r\nTower-hill, as some of them may,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Westbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope he has\r\nmade some testament, or provided for thee somehow. This letter says he\r\nrecommends unicum filium suum dilectissimum to his lady. I hope he has\r\nleft you more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry did not know, he said. He was in the hands of Heaven and Fate; but\r\nmore lonely now, as it seemed to him, than he had been all the rest of\r\nhis life; and that night, as he lay in his little room which he still\r\noccupied, the boy thought with many a pang of shame and grief of his\r\nstrange and solitary condition: how he had a father and no father; a\r\nnameless mother that had been brought to ruin, perhaps, by that very\r\nfather whom Harry could only acknowledge in secret and with a blush,\r\nand whom he could neither love nor revere. And he sickened to think how\r\nFather Holt, a stranger, and two or three soldiers, his acquaintances\r\nof the last six weeks, were the only friends he had in the great wide\r\nworld, where he was now quite alone. The soul of the boy was full of\r\nlove, and he longed as he lay in the darkness there for some one upon\r\nwhom he could bestow it. He remembers, and must to his dying day, the\r\nthoughts and tears of that long night, the hours tolling through it.\r\nWho was he, and what? Why here rather than elsewhere? I have a mind, he\r\nthought, to go to that priest at Trim, and find out what my father said\r\nto him on his death-bed confession. Is there any child in the whole\r\nworld so unprotected as I am? Shall I get up and quit this place, and\r\nrun to Ireland? With these thoughts and tears the lad passed that night\r\naway until he wept himself to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the gentlemen of the guard, who had heard what had\r\nbefallen him, were more than usually kind to the child, especially his\r\nfriend Scholar Dick, who told him about his own father's death, which\r\nhad happened when Dick was a child at Dublin, not quite five years of\r\nage. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the first sensation of grief,\xe2\x80\x9d Dick said, \xe2\x80\x9cI ever knew.\r\nI remember I went into the room where his body lay, and my mother sat\r\nweeping beside it. I had my battledore in my hand, and fell a-beating\r\nthe coffin, and calling Papa; on which my mother caught me in her arms,\r\nand told me in a flood of tears Papa could not hear me, and would play\r\nwith me no more, for they were going to put him under ground, whence he\r\ncould never come to us again. And this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick kindly, \xe2\x80\x9chas made\r\nme pity all children ever since; and caused me to love thee, my poor\r\nfatherless, motherless lad. And, if ever thou wantest a friend, thou\r\nshalt have one in Richard Steele.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond thanked him, and was grateful. But what could Corporal\r\nSteele do for him? take him to ride a spare horse, and be servant to the\r\ntroop? Though there might be a bar in Harry Esmond's shield, it was a\r\nnoble one. The counsel of the two friends was, that little Harry\r\nshould stay where he was, and abide his fortune: so Esmond stayed on at\r\nCastlewood, awaiting with no small anxiety the fate, whatever it was,\r\nwhich was over him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nI AM LEFT AT CASTLEWOOD AN ORPHAN, AND FIND MOST KIND PROTECTORS THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the stay of the soldiers in Castlewood, honest Dick the Scholar\r\nwas the constant companion of the lonely little orphan lad Harry Esmond:\r\nand they read together, and they played bowls together, and when the\r\nother troopers or their officers, who were free-spoken over their cups,\r\n(as was the way of that day, when neither men nor women were over-nice,)\r\ntalked unbecomingly of their amours and gallantries before the child,\r\nDick, who very likely was setting the whole company laughing, would stop\r\ntheir jokes with a maxima debetur pueris reverentia, and once offered\r\nto lug out against another trooper called Hulking Tom, who wanted to ask\r\nHarry Esmond a ribald question.\r\n\r\nAlso, Dick seeing that the child had, as he said, a sensibility above\r\nhis years, and a great and praiseworthy discretion, confided to Harry\r\nhis love for a vintner's daughter, near to the Tollyard, Westminster,\r\nwhom Dick addressed as Saccharissa in many verses of his composition,\r\nand without whom he said it would be impossible that he could continue\r\nto live. He vowed this a thousand times in a day, though Harry smiled to\r\nsee the love-lorn swain had his health and appetite as well as the most\r\nheart-whole trooper in the regiment: and he swore Harry to secrecy too,\r\nwhich vow the lad religiously kept, until he found that officers and\r\nprivates were all taken into Dick's confidence, and had the benefit of\r\nhis verses. And it must be owned likewise that, while Dick was sighing\r\nafter Saccharissa in London, he had consolations in the country; for\r\nthere came a wench out of Castlewood village who had washed his linen,\r\nand who cried sadly when she heard he was gone: and without paying her\r\nbill too, which Harry Esmond took upon himself to discharge by giving\r\nthe girl a silver pocket-piece, which Scholar Dick had presented to him,\r\nwhen, with many embraces and prayers for his prosperity, Dick parted\r\nfrom him, the garrison of Castlewood being ordered away. Dick the\r\nScholar said he would never forget his young friend, nor indeed did he:\r\nand Harry was sorry when the kind soldiers vacated Castlewood, looking\r\nforward with no small anxiety (for care and solitude had made him\r\nthoughtful beyond his years) to his fate when the new lord and lady of\r\nthe house came to live there. He had lived to be past twelve years old\r\nnow; and had never had a friend, save this wild trooper, perhaps, and\r\nFather Holt; and had a fond and affectionate heart, tender to weakness,\r\nthat would fain attach itself to somebody, and did not seem at rest\r\nuntil it had found a friend who would take charge of it.\r\n\r\nThe instinct which led Henry Esmond to admire and love the gracious\r\nperson, the fair apparition of whose beauty and kindness had so moved\r\nhim when he first beheld her, became soon a devoted affection and\r\npassion of gratitude, which entirely filled his young heart, that\r\nas yet, except in the case of dear Father Holt, had had very little\r\nkindness for which to be thankful. O Dea certe, thought he, remembering\r\nthe lines out of the AEneas which Mr. Holt had taught him. There seemed,\r\nas the boy thought, in every look or gesture of this fair creature,\r\nan angelical softness and bright pity--in motion or repose she seemed\r\ngracious alike; the tone of her voice, though she uttered words ever so\r\ntrivial, gave him a pleasure that amounted almost to anguish. It cannot\r\nbe called love, that a lad of twelve years of age, little more than a\r\nmenial, felt for an exalted lady, his mistress: but it was worship.\r\nTo catch her glance, to divine her errand and run on it before she had\r\nspoken it; to watch, follow, adore her; became the business of his life.\r\nMeanwhile, as is the way often, his idol had idols of her own, and never\r\nthought of or suspected the admiration of her little pigmy adorer.\r\n\r\nMy lady had on her side her three idols: first and foremost, Jove\r\nand supreme ruler, was her lord, Harry's patron, the good Viscount of\r\nCastlewood. All wishes of his were laws with her. If he had a headache,\r\nshe was ill. If he frowned, she trembled. If he joked, she smiled and\r\nwas charmed. If he went a-hunting, she was always at the window to see\r\nhim ride away, her little son crowing on her arm, or on the watch till\r\nhis return. She made dishes for his dinner: spiced wine for him: made\r\nthe toast for his tankard at breakfast: hushed the house when he slept\r\nin his chair, and watched for a look when he woke. If my lord was not a\r\nlittle proud of his beauty, my lady adored it. She clung to his arm as\r\nhe paced the terrace, her two fair little hands clasped round his great\r\none; her eyes were never tired of looking in his face and wondering at\r\nits perfection. Her little son was his son, and had his father's look\r\nand curly brown hair. Her daughter Beatrix was his daughter, and had his\r\neyes--were there ever such beautiful eyes in the world? All the house\r\nwas arranged so as to bring him ease and give him pleasure. She liked\r\nthe small gentry round about to come and pay him court, never caring for\r\nadmiration for herself; those who wanted to be well with the lady must\r\nadmire him. Not regarding her dress, she would wear a gown to rags,\r\nbecause he had once liked it: and, if he brought her a brooch or a\r\nribbon, would prefer it to all the most costly articles of her wardrobe.\r\n\r\nMy lord went to London every year for six weeks, and the family being\r\ntoo poor to appear at Court with any figure, he went alone. It was not\r\nuntil he was out of sight that her face showed any sorrow: and what\r\na joy when he came back! What preparation before his return! The fond\r\ncreature had his arm-chair at the chimney-side--delighting to put the\r\nchildren in it, and look at them there. Nobody took his place at the\r\ntable; but his silver tankard stood there as when my lord was present.\r\n\r\nA pretty sight it was to see, during my lord's absence, or on those many\r\nmornings when sleep or headache kept him a-bed, this fair young lady of\r\nCastlewood, her little daughter at her knee, and her domestics gathered\r\nround her, reading the Morning Prayer of the English Church. Esmond\r\nlong remembered how she looked and spoke, kneeling reverently before the\r\nsacred book, the sun shining upon her golden hair until it made a halo\r\nround about her. A dozen of the servants of the house kneeled in a line\r\nopposite their mistress; for a while Harry Esmond kept apart from these\r\nmysteries, but Doctor Tusher showing him that the prayers read were\r\nthose of the Church of all ages, and the boy's own inclination prompting\r\nhim to be always as near as he might to his mistress, and to think all\r\nthings she did right, from listening to the prayers in the ante-chamber,\r\nhe came presently to kneel down with the rest of the household in\r\nthe parlor; and before a couple of years my lady had made a thorough\r\nconvert. Indeed, the boy loved his catechiser so much that he would have\r\nsubscribed to anything she bade him, and was never tired of listening to\r\nher fond discourse and simple comments upon the book, which she read to\r\nhim in a voice of which it was difficult to resist the sweet persuasion\r\nand tender appealing kindness. This friendly controversy, and the\r\nintimacy which it occasioned, bound the lad more fondly than ever to his\r\nmistress. The happiest period of all his life was this; and the\r\nyoung mother, with her daughter and son, and the orphan lad whom she\r\nprotected, read and worked and played, and were children together.\r\nIf the lady looked forward--as what fond woman does not?--towards the\r\nfuture, she had no plans from which Harry Esmond was left out; and a\r\nthousand and a thousand times, in his passionate and impetuous way,\r\nhe vowed that no power should separate him from his mistress; and only\r\nasked for some chance to happen by which he might show his fidelity\r\nto her. Now, at the close of his life, as he sits and recalls in\r\ntranquillity the happy and busy scenes of it, he can think, not\r\nungratefully, that he has been faithful to that early vow. Such a life\r\nis so simple that years may be chronicled in a few lines. But few men's\r\nlife-voyages are destined to be all prosperous; and this calm of which\r\nwe are speaking was soon to come to an end.\r\n\r\nAs Esmond grew, and observed for himself, he found of necessity much to\r\nread and think of outside that fond circle of kinsfolk who had admitted\r\nhim to join hand with them. He read more books than they cared to study\r\nwith him; was alone in the midst of them many a time, and passed nights\r\nover labors, futile perhaps, but in which they could not join him. His\r\ndear mistress divined his thoughts with her usual jealous watchfulness\r\nof affection: began to forebode a time when he would escape from his\r\nhome-nest; and, at his eager protestations to the contrary, would\r\nonly sigh and shake her head. Before those fatal decrees in life are\r\nexecuted, there are always secret previsions and warning omens. When\r\neverything yet seems calm, we are aware that the storm is coming. Ere\r\nthe happy days were over, two at least of that home-party felt that they\r\nwere drawing to a close; and were uneasy, and on the look-out for the\r\ncloud which was to obscure their calm.\r\n\r\n'Twas easy for Harry to see, however much his lady persisted in\r\nobedience and admiration for her husband, that my lord tired of his\r\nquiet life, and grew weary, and then testy, at those gentle bonds with\r\nwhich his wife would have held him. As they say the Grand Lama of Thibet\r\nis very much fatigued by his character of divinity, and yawns on\r\nhis altar as his bonzes kneel and worship him, many a home-god grows\r\nheartily sick of the reverence with which his family-devotees pursue\r\nhim, and sighs for freedom and for his old life, and to be off the\r\npedestal on which his dependants would have him sit for ever, whilst\r\nthey adore him, and ply him with flowers, and hymns, and incense,\r\nand flattery;--so, after a few years of his marriage my honest Lord\r\nCastlewood began to tire; all the high-flown raptures and devotional\r\nceremonies with which his wife, his chief priestess, treated him, first\r\nsent him to sleep, and then drove him out of doors; for the truth must\r\nbe told, that my lord was a jolly gentleman, with very little of the\r\naugust or divine in his nature, though his fond wife persisted in\r\nrevering it--and, besides, he had to pay a penalty for this love, which\r\npersons of his disposition seldom like to defray: and, in a word, if he\r\nhad a loving wife, had a very jealous and exacting one. Then he wearied\r\nof this jealousy; then he broke away from it; then came, no doubt,\r\ncomplaints and recriminations; then, perhaps, promises of amendment\r\nnot fulfilled; then upbraidings not the more pleasant because they\r\nwere silent, and only sad looks and tearful eyes conveyed them. Then,\r\nperhaps, the pair reached that other stage which is not uncommon in\r\nmarried life, when the woman perceives that the god of the honeymoon is\r\na god no more; only a mortal like the rest of us--and so she looks into\r\nher heart, and lo! vacuae sedes et inania arcana. And now, supposing our\r\nlady to have a fine genius and a brilliant wit of her own, and the magic\r\nspell and infatuation removed from her which had led her to worship as\r\na god a very ordinary mortal--and what follows? They live together, and\r\nthey dine together, and they say \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmy love\xe2\x80\x9d as heretofore;\r\nbut the man is himself, and the woman herself: that dream of love is\r\nover as everything else is over in life; as flowers and fury, and griefs\r\nand pleasures, are over.\r\n\r\nVery likely the Lady Castlewood had ceased to adore her husband herself\r\nlong before she got off her knees, or would allow her household to\r\ndiscontinue worshipping him. To do him justice, my lord never exacted\r\nthis subservience: he laughed and joked and drank his bottle, and\r\nswore when he was angry, much too familiarly for any one pretending to\r\nsublimity; and did his best to destroy the ceremonial with which his\r\nwife chose to surround him. And it required no great conceit on young\r\nEsmond's part to see that his own brains were better than his patron's,\r\nwho, indeed, never assumed any airs of superiority over the lad, or\r\nover any dependant of his, save when he was displeased, in which case he\r\nwould express his mind in oaths very freely; and who, on the contrary,\r\nperhaps, spoiled \xe2\x80\x9cParson Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called young Esmond, by\r\nconstantly praising his parts and admiring his boyish stock of learning.\r\n\r\nIt may seem ungracious in one who has received a hundred favors from his\r\npatron to speak in any but a reverential manner of his elders; but the\r\npresent writer has had descendants of his own, whom he has brought\r\nup with as little as possible of the servility at present exacted\r\nby parents from children (under which mask of duty there often lurks\r\nindifference, contempt, or rebellion): and as he would have his\r\ngrandsons believe or represent him to be not an inch taller than Nature\r\nhas made him: so, with regard to his past acquaintances, he would\r\nspeak without anger, but with truth, as far as he knows it, neither\r\nextenuating nor setting down aught in malice.\r\n\r\nSo long, then, as the world moved according to Lord Castlewood's wishes,\r\nhe was good-humored enough; of a temper naturally sprightly and easy,\r\nliking to joke, especially with his inferiors, and charmed to receive\r\nthe tribute of their laughter. All exercises of the body he could\r\nperform to perfection--shooting at a mark and flying, breaking horses,\r\nriding at the ring, pitching the quoit, playing at all games with great\r\nskill. And not only did he do these things well, but he thought he did\r\nthem to perfection; hence he was often tricked about horses, which he\r\npretended to know better than any jockey; was made to play at ball and\r\nbilliards by sharpers who took his money, and came back from London\r\nwofully poorer each time than he went, as the state of his affairs\r\ntestified when the sudden accident came by which his career was brought\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of the parade of dress, and passed as many hours daily at\r\nhis toilette as an elderly coquette. A tenth part of his day was spent\r\nin the brushing of his teeth and the oiling of his hair, which was\r\ncurling and brown, and which he did not like to conceal under a periwig,\r\nsuch as almost everybody of that time wore. (We have the liberty of our\r\nhair back now, but powder and pomatum along with it. When, I wonder,\r\nwill these monstrous poll-taxes of our age be withdrawn, and men allowed\r\nto carry their colors, black, red, or gray, as Nature made them?) And as\r\nhe liked her to be well dressed, his lady spared no pains in that matter\r\nto please him; indeed, she would dress her head or cut it off if he had\r\nbidden her.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonder to young Esmond, serving as page to my lord and lady,\r\nto hear, day after day, to such company as came, the same boisterous\r\nstories told by my lord, at which his lady never failed to smile or hold\r\ndown her head, and Doctor Tusher to burst out laughing at the proper\r\npoint, or cry, \xe2\x80\x9cFie, my lord, remember my cloth!\xe2\x80\x9d but with such a\r\nfaint show of resistance, that it only provoked my lord further. Lord\r\nCastlewood's stories rose by degrees, and became stronger after the ale\r\nat dinner and the bottle afterwards; my lady always taking flight after\r\nthe very first glass to Church and King, and leaving the gentlemen to\r\ndrink the rest of the toasts by themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd, as Harry Esmond was her page, he also was called from duty at this\r\ntime. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lord has lived in the army and with soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d she would\r\nsay to the lad, \xe2\x80\x9camongst whom great license is allowed. You have had\r\na different nurture, and I trust these things will change as you grow\r\nolder; not that any fault attaches to my lord, who is one of the best\r\nand most religious men in this kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d And very likely she believed\r\nso. 'Tis strange what a man may do, and a woman yet think him an angel.\r\n\r\nAnd as Esmond has taken truth for his motto, it must be owned, even\r\nwith regard to that other angel, his mistress, that she had a fault of\r\ncharacter which flawed her perfections. With the other sex perfectly\r\ntolerant and kindly, of her own she was invariably jealous; and a proof\r\nthat she had this vice is, that though she would acknowledge a thousand\r\nfaults that she had not, to this which she had she could never be got\r\nto own. But if there came a woman with even a semblance of beauty to\r\nCastlewood, she was so sure to find out some wrong in her, that my lord,\r\nlaughing in his jolly way, would often joke with her concerning her\r\nfoible. Comely servant-maids might come for hire, but none were taken\r\nat Castlewood. The housekeeper was old; my lady's own waiting-woman\r\nsquinted, and was marked with the small-pox; the housemaids and scullion\r\nwere ordinary country wenches, to whom Lady Castlewood was kind, as her\r\nnature made her to everybody almost; but as soon as ever she had to do\r\nwith a pretty woman, she was cold, retiring, and haughty. The country\r\nladies found this fault in her; and though the men all admired her,\r\ntheir wives and daughters complained of her coldness and aims, and said\r\nthat Castlewood was pleasanter in Lady Jezebel's time (as the dowager\r\nwas called) than at present. Some few were of my mistress's side.\r\nOld Lady Blenkinsop Jointure, who had been at court in King James the\r\nFirst's time, always took her side; and so did old Mistress Crookshank,\r\nBishop Crookshank's daughter, of Hexton, who, with some more of their\r\nlike, pronounced my lady an angel: but the pretty women were not of this\r\nmind; and the opinion of the country was that my lord was tied to his\r\nwife's apron-strings, and that she ruled over him.\r\n\r\nThe second fight which Harry Esmond had, was at fourteen years of age,\r\nwith Bryan Hawkshaw, Sir John Hawkshaw's son, of Bramblebrook, who,\r\nadvancing this opinion, that my lady was jealous and henpecked my lord,\r\nput Harry in such a fury, that Harry fell on him and with such rage,\r\nthat the other boy, who was two years older and by far bigger than he,\r\nhad by far the worst of the assault, until it was interrupted by Doctor\r\nTusher walking out of the dinner-room.\r\n\r\nBryan Hawkshaw got up bleeding at the nose, having, indeed, been\r\nsurprised, as many a stronger man might have been, by the fury of the\r\nassault upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou little bastard beggar!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll murder you for this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd indeed he was big enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBastard or not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, grinding his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\ncouple of swords, and if you like to meet me, as a man, on the terrace\r\nto-night--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here the Doctor coming up, the colloquy of the young champions\r\nended. Very likely, big as he was, Hawkshaw did not care to continue a\r\nfight with such a ferocious opponent as this had been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAFTER GOOD FORTUNE COMES EVIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince my Lady Mary Wortley Montagu brought home the custom of\r\ninoculation from Turkey (a perilous practice many deem it, and only a\r\nuseless rushing into the jaws of danger), I think the severity of the\r\nsmall-pox, that dreadful scourge of the world, has somewhat been abated\r\nin our part of it; and remember in my time hundreds of the young and\r\nbeautiful who have been carried to the grave, or have only risen from\r\ntheir pillows frightfully scarred and disfigured by this malady. Many\r\na sweet face hath left its roses on the bed on which this dreadful and\r\nwithering blight has laid them. In my early days, this pestilence would\r\nenter a village and destroy half its inhabitants: at its approach, it\r\nmay well be imagined, not only the beautiful but the strongest were\r\nalarmed, and those fled who could. One day in the year 1694 (I have good\r\nreason to remember it), Doctor Tusher ran into Castlewood House, with a\r\nface of consternation, saying that the malady had made its appearance at\r\nthe blacksmith's house in the village, and that one of the maids there\r\nwas down in the small-pox.\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith, besides his forge and irons for horses, had an ale-house\r\nfor men, which his wife kept, and his company sat on benches before the\r\ninn-door, looking at the smithy while they drank their beer. Now,\r\nthere was a pretty girl at this inn, the landlord's men called Nancy\r\nSievewright, a bouncing, fresh-looking lass, whose face was as red as\r\nthe hollyhocks over the pales of the garden behind the inn. At this time\r\nHarry Esmond was a lad of sixteen, and somehow in his walks and rambles\r\nit often happened that he fell in with Nancy Sievewright's bonny face;\r\nif he did not want something done at the blacksmith's he would go and\r\ndrink ale at the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Castles,\xe2\x80\x9d or find some pretext for seeing this\r\npoor Nancy. Poor thing, Harry meant or imagined no harm; and she, no\r\ndoubt, as little, but the truth is they were always meeting--in the\r\nlanes, or by the brook, or at the garden-palings, or about Castlewood:\r\nit was, \xe2\x80\x9cLord, Mr. Henry!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chow do you do, Nancy?\xe2\x80\x9d many and many a\r\ntime in the week. 'Tis surprising the magnetic attraction which draws\r\npeople together from ever so far. I blush as I think of poor Nancy now,\r\nin a red bodice and buxom purple cheeks and a canvas petticoat; and that\r\nI devised schemes, and set traps, and made speeches in my heart, which\r\nI seldom had courage to say when in presence of that humble enchantress,\r\nwho knew nothing beyond milking a cow, and opened her black eyes with\r\nwonder when I made one of my fine speeches out of Waller or Ovid. Poor\r\nNancy! from the midst of far-off years thine honest country face beams\r\nout; and I remember thy kind voice as if I had heard it yesterday.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Tusher brought the news that the small-pox was at the \xe2\x80\x9cThree\r\nCastles,\xe2\x80\x9d whither a tramper, it was said, had brought the malady, Henry\r\nEsmond's first thought was of alarm for poor Nancy, and then of shame\r\nand disquiet for the Castlewood family, lest he might have brought this\r\ninfection; for the truth is that Mr. Harry had been sitting in a back\r\nroom for an hour that day, where Nancy Sievewright was with a little\r\nbrother who complained of headache, and was lying stupefied and crying,\r\neither in a chair by the corner of the fire, or in Nancy's lap, or on\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nLittle Lady Beatrix screamed out at Dr. Tusher's news; and my lord cried\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me!\xe2\x80\x9d He was a brave man, and not afraid of death in\r\nany shape but this. He was very proud of his pink complexion and fair\r\nhair--but the idea of death by small-pox scared him beyond all other\r\nends. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will take the children and ride away to-morrow to Walcote:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n this was my lord's small house, inherited from his mother, near to\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the best refuge in case the disease spreads,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Tusher.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis awful to think of it beginning at the ale-house; half the people\r\nof the village have visited that to-day, or the blacksmith's, which is\r\nthe same thing. My clerk Nahum lodges with them--I can never go into my\r\nreading-desk and have that fellow so near me. I WON'T have that man near\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a parishioner dying in the small-pox sent to you, would you not go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked my lady, looking up from her frame of work, with her calm blue\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Lord, I wouldn't,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not in a popish country; and a sick man doth not absolutely\r\nneed absolution and confession,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis true they are a\r\ncomfort and a help to him when attainable, and to be administered with\r\nhope of good. But in a case where the life of a parish priest in the\r\nmidst of his flock is highly valuable to them, he is not called upon to\r\nrisk it (and therewith the lives, future prospects, and temporal, even\r\nspiritual welfare of his own family) for the sake of a single person,\r\nwho is not very likely in a condition even to understand the religious\r\nmessage whereof the priest is the bringer--being uneducated, and\r\nlikewise stupefied or delirious by disease. If your ladyship or his\r\nlordship, my excellent good friend and patron, were to take it . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Dr. Tusher. \xe2\x80\x9cAmen to that prayer, my very good lord!\r\nfor your sake I would lay my life down\xe2\x80\x9d--and, to judge from the alarmed\r\nlook of the Doctor's purple face, you would have thought that that\r\nsacrifice was about to be called for instantly.\r\n\r\nTo love children, and be gentle with them, was an instinct, rather than\r\na merit, in Henry Esmond; so much so, that he thought almost with a\r\nsort of shame of his liking for them, and of the softness into which it\r\nbetrayed him; and on this day the poor fellow had not only had his\r\nyoung friend, the milkmaid's brother, on his knee, but had been drawing\r\npictures and telling stories to the little Frank Castlewood, who had\r\noccupied the same place for an hour after dinner, and was never tired\r\nof Henry's tales, and his pictures of soldiers and horses. As luck would\r\nhave it, Beatrix had not on that evening taken her usual place, which\r\ngenerally she was glad enough to have, upon her tutor's lap. For\r\nBeatrix, from the earliest time, was jealous of every caress which was\r\ngiven to her little brother Frank. She would fling away even from the\r\nmaternal arms, if she saw Frank had been there before her; insomuch that\r\nLady Esmond was obliged not to show her love for her son in the presence\r\nof the little girl, and embraced one or the other alone. She would turn\r\npale and red with rage if she caught signs of intelligence or affection\r\nbetween Frank and his mother: would sit apart, and not speak for a whole\r\nnight, if she thought the boy had a better fruit or a larger cake than\r\nhers; would fling away a ribbon if he had one; and from the earliest\r\nage, sitting up in her little chair by the great fireplace opposite to\r\nthe corner where Lady Castlewood commonly sat at her embroidery, would\r\nutter infantine sarcasms about the favor shown to her brother. These, if\r\nspoken in the presence of Lord Castlewood, tickled and amused his humor;\r\nhe would pretend to love Frank best, and dandle and kiss him, and roar\r\nwith laughter at Beatrix's jealousy. But the truth is, my lord did not\r\noften witness these scenes, nor very much trouble the quiet fireside at\r\nwhich his lady passed many long evenings. My lord was hunting all day\r\nwhen the season admitted; he frequented all the cock-fights and fairs\r\nin the country, and would ride twenty miles to see a main fought, or two\r\nclowns break their heads at a cudgelling-match; and he liked better to\r\nsit in his parlor drinking ale and punch with Jack and Tom, than in\r\nhis wife's drawing-room: whither, if he came, he brought only too often\r\nbloodshot eyes, a hiccupping voice, and a reeling gait. The management\r\nof the house, and the property, the care of the few tenants and the\r\nvillage poor, and the accounts of the estate, were in the hands of his\r\nlady and her young secretary, Harry Esmond. My lord took charge of the\r\nstables, the kennel, and the cellar--and he filled this and emptied it\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nSo it chanced that upon this very day, when poor Harry Esmond had had\r\nthe blacksmith's son, and the peer's son, alike upon his knee, little\r\nBeatrix, who would come to her tutor willingly enough with her book and\r\nher writing, had refused him, seeing the place occupied by her brother,\r\nand, luckily for her, had sat at the further end of the room, away from\r\nhim, playing with a spaniel dog which she had, (and for which, by fits\r\nand starts, she would take a great affection,) and talking at Harry\r\nEsmond over her shoulder, as she pretended to caress the dog, saying\r\nthat Fido would love her, and she would love Fido, and nothing but Fido\r\nall her life.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, the news was brought that the little boy at the \xe2\x80\x9cThree\r\nCastles\xe2\x80\x9d was ill with the small-pox, poor Harry Esmond felt a shock of\r\nalarm, not so much for himself as for his mistress's son, whom he might\r\nhave brought into peril. Beatrix, who had pouted sufficiently, (and who,\r\nwhenever a stranger appeared, began, from infancy almost, to play off\r\nlittle graces to catch his attention,) her brother being now gone to\r\nbed, was for taking her place upon Esmond's knee: for, though the Doctor\r\nwas very obsequious to her, she did not like him, because he had thick\r\nboots and dirty hands (the pert young miss said), and because she hated\r\nlearning the catechism.\r\n\r\nBut as she advanced towards Esmond from the corner where she had been\r\nsulking, he started back and placed the great chair on which he was\r\nsitting between him and her--saying in the French language to Lady\r\nCastlewood, with whom the young lad had read much, and whom he had\r\nperfected in this tongue--\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, the child must not approach me; I must\r\ntell you that I was at the blacksmith's to-day, and had his little boy\r\nupon my lap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you took my son afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Castlewood said, very angry,\r\nand turning red. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, sir, for giving him such company.\r\nBeatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in English, \xe2\x80\x9cI forbid you to touch Mr. Esmond. Come\r\naway, child--come to your room. Come to your room--I wish your Reverence\r\ngood-night--and you, sir, had you not better go back to your friends at\r\nthe ale-house?\xe2\x80\x9d her eyes, ordinarily so kind, darted flashes of anger\r\nas she spoke; and she tossed up her head (which hung down commonly) with\r\nthe mien of a princess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey-day!\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, who was standing by the fireplace--indeed\r\nhe was in the position to which he generally came by that hour of the\r\nevening--\xe2\x80\x9cHey-day! Rachel, what are you in a passion about? Ladies ought\r\nnever to be in a passion. Ought they, Doctor Tusher? though it does good\r\nto see Rachel in a passion--Damme, Lady Castlewood, you look dev'lish\r\nhandsome in a passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, my lord, because Mr. Henry Esmond, having nothing to do with\r\nhis time here, and not having a taste for our company, has been to the\r\nale-house, where he has SOME FRIENDS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord burst out, with a laugh and an oath--\xe2\x80\x9cYou young slyboots, you've\r\nbeen at Nancy Sievewright. D--- the young hypocrite, who'd have thought\r\nit in him? I say, Tusher, he's been after--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady, \xe2\x80\x9cdon't insult me with this talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Harry, ready to cry with shame and\r\nmortification, \xe2\x80\x9cthe honor of that young person is perfectly unstained\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, more and more laughing and\r\ntipsy. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon his HONOR, Doctor--Nancy Sieve-- . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake Mistress Beatrix to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d my lady cried at this moment to Mrs.\r\nTucker her woman, who came in with her ladyship's tea. \xe2\x80\x9cPut her into my\r\nroom--no, into yours,\xe2\x80\x9d she added quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, my child: go, I say: not\r\na word!\xe2\x80\x9d And Beatrix, quite surprised at so sudden a tone of authority\r\nfrom one who was seldom accustomed to raise her voice, went out of the\r\nroom with a scared countenance, and waited even to burst out a-crying\r\nuntil she got to the door with Mrs. Tucker.\r\n\r\nFor once her mother took little heed of her sobbing, and continued\r\nto speak eagerly--\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis young man--your\r\ndependant--told me just now in French--he was ashamed to speak in his\r\nown language--that he had been at the ale-house all day, where he has\r\nhad that little wretch who is now ill of the small-pox on his knee. And\r\nhe comes home reeking from that place--yes, reeking from it--and takes\r\nmy boy into his lap without shame, and sits down by me, yes, by ME.\r\nHe may have killed Frank for what I know--killed our child. Why was he\r\nbrought in to disgrace our house? Why is he here? Let him go--let him\r\ngo, I say, to-night, and pollute the place no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had never once uttered a syllable of unkindness to Harry Esmond; and\r\nher cruel words smote the poor boy, so that he stood for some moments\r\nbewildered with grief and rage at the injustice of such a stab from such\r\na hand. He turned quite white from red, which he had been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help my birth, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnor my other misfortune. And\r\nas for your boy, if--if my coming nigh to him pollutes him now, it was\r\nnot so always. Good-night, my lord. Heaven bless you and yours for your\r\ngoodness to me. I have tired her ladyship's kindness out, and I will\r\ngo;\xe2\x80\x9d and, sinking down on his knee, Harry Esmond took the rough hand of\r\nhis benefactor and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to go to the ale-house--let him go,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm d--d if he shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn't think you could be so\r\nd--d ungrateful, Rachel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer reply was to burst into a flood of tears, and to quit the room with\r\na rapid glance at Harry Esmond,--as my lord, not heeding them, and\r\nstill in great good-humor, raised up his young client from his kneeling\r\nposture (for a thousand kindnesses had caused the lad to revere my lord\r\nas a father), and put his broad hand on Harry Esmond's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was always so,\xe2\x80\x9d my lord said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe very notion of a woman drives\r\nher mad. I took to liquor on that very account, by Jove, for no other\r\nreason than that; for she can't be jealous of a beer-barrel or a bottle\r\nof rum, can she, Doctor? D--- it, look at the maids--just look at\r\nthe maids in the house\xe2\x80\x9d (my lord pronounced all the words\r\ntogether--just-look-at-the-maze-in-the-house: jever-see-such-maze?) \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwouldn't take a wife out of Castlewood now, would you, Doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d and my\r\nlord burst out laughing.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, who had been looking at my Lord Castlewood from under his\r\neyelids, said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut joking apart, and, my lord, as a divine, I\r\ncannot treat the subject in a jocular light, nor, as a pastor of this\r\ncongregation, look with anything but sorrow at the idea of so very young\r\na sheep going astray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Esmond, bursting out indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe told me that\r\nyou yourself were a horrid old man, and had offered to kiss her in the\r\ndairy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Doctor Tusher, turning as red as a\r\nturkey-cock, while my lord continued to roar with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nlisten to the falsehoods of an abandoned girl--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is as honest as any woman in England, and as pure for me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nout Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cand, as kind, and as good. For shame on you to malign her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar be it from me to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven grant I may\r\nbe mistaken in the girl, and in you, sir, who have a truly PRECOCIOUS\r\ngenius; but that is not the point at issue at present. It appears that\r\nthe small-pox broke out in the little boy at the 'Three Castles;' that\r\nit was on him when you visited the ale-house, for your OWN reasons; and\r\nthat you sat with the child for some time, and immediately afterwards\r\nwith my young lord.\xe2\x80\x9d The Doctor raised his voice as he spoke, and\r\nlooked towards my lady, who had now come back, looking very pale, with a\r\nhandkerchief in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very true, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Esmond, looking at the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis to be feared that he may have brought the infection with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the ale-house--yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--- it, I forgot when I collared you, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my lord, stepping\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep off, Harry my boy; there's no good in running into the\r\nwolf's jaws, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady looked at him with some surprise, and instantly advancing to\r\nHenry Esmond, took his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nspoke very unkindly. I have no right to interfere with you--with your--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord broke out into an oath. \xe2\x80\x9cCan't you leave the boy alone, my\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked a little red, and faintly pressed the lad's hand as\r\nshe dropped it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no use, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cFrank was on his knee as he was\r\nmaking pictures, and was running constantly from Henry to me. The evil\r\nis done, if any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot with me, damme,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cI've been smoking,\xe2\x80\x9d--and he\r\nlighted his pipe again with a coal--\xe2\x80\x9cand it keeps off infection; and as\r\nthe disease is in the village--plague take it--I would have you leave\r\nit. We'll go to-morrow to Walcote, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady; \xe2\x80\x9cI may have had it as an infant: it\r\nbroke out in our house then; and when four of my sisters had it at home,\r\ntwo years before our marriage, I escaped it, and two of my dear sisters\r\ndied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't run the risk,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord; \xe2\x80\x9cI'm as bold as any man, but I'll\r\nnot bear that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake Beatrix with you and go,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady. \xe2\x80\x9cFor us the mischief is\r\ndone; and Tucker can wait upon us, who has had the disease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take care to choose 'em ugly enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord, at which her\r\nladyship hung down her head and looked foolish: and my lord, calling\r\naway Tusher, bade him come to the oak parlor and have a pipe. The Doctor\r\nmade a low bow to her ladyship (of which salaams he was profuse), and\r\nwalked off on his creaking square-toes after his patron.\r\n\r\nWhen the lady and the young man were alone, there was a silence of some\r\nmoments, during which he stood at the fire, looking rather vacantly\r\nat the dying embers, whilst her ladyship busied herself with the\r\ntambour-frame and needles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a pause, in a hard, dry voice,--\xe2\x80\x9cI REPEAT\r\nI am sorry that I showed myself so ungrateful for the safety of my son.\r\nIt was not at all my wish that you should leave us, I am sure, unless\r\nyou found pleasure elsewhere. But you must perceive, Mr. Esmond, that at\r\nyour age, and with your tastes, it is impossible that you can continue\r\nto stay upon the intimate footing in which you have been in this family.\r\nYou have wished to go to the University, and I think 'tis quite as well\r\nthat you should be sent thither. I did not press this matter, thinking\r\nyou a child, as you are, indeed, in years--quite a child; and I\r\nshould never have thought of treating you otherwise until--until these\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES came to light. And I shall beg my lord to despatch you\r\nas quick as possible: and will go on with Frank's learning as well as I\r\ncan, (I owe my father thanks for a little grounding, and you, I'm sure,\r\nfor much that you have taught me,)--and--and I wish you a good-night,\r\nMr. Esmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this she dropped a stately curtsy, and, taking her candle,\r\nwent away through the tapestry door, which led to her apartments. Esmond\r\nstood by the fireplace, blankly staring after her. Indeed, he scarce\r\nseemed to see until she was gone; and then her image was impressed upon\r\nhim, and remained for ever fixed upon his memory. He saw her retreating,\r\nthe taper lighting up her marble face, her scarlet lip quivering, and\r\nher shining golden hair. He went to his own room, and to bed, where he\r\ntried to read, as his custom was; but he never knew what he was reading\r\nuntil afterwards he remembered the appearance of the letters of the book\r\n(it was in Montaigne's Essays), and the events of the day passed before\r\nhim--that is, of the last hour of the day; for as for the morning, and\r\nthe poor milkmaid yonder, he never so much as once thought. And he could\r\nnot get to sleep until daylight, and woke with a violent headache, and\r\nquite unrefreshed.\r\n\r\nHe had brought the contagion with him from the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Castles\xe2\x80\x9d sure\r\nenough, and was presently laid up with the smallpox, which spared the\r\nhall no more than it did the cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nI HAVE THE SMALL-POX, AND PREPARE TO LEAVE CASTLEWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Harry Esmond passed through the crisis of that malady, and returned\r\nto health again, he found that little Frank Esmond had also suffered\r\nand rallied after the disease, and the lady his mother was down with it,\r\nwith a couple more of the household. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a Providence, for which we\r\nall ought to be thankful,\xe2\x80\x9d Doctor Tusher said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my lady and her son\r\nwere spared, while Death carried off the poor domestics of the house;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and rebuked Harry for asking, in his simple way, For which we ought\r\nto be thankful--that the servants were killed, or the gentlefolks\r\nwere saved? Nor could young Esmond agree in the Doctor's vehement\r\nprotestations to my lady, when he visited her during her convalescence,\r\nthat the malady had not in the least impaired her charms, and had not\r\nbeen churl enough to injure the fair features of the Viscountess of\r\nCastlewood; whereas, in spite of these fine speeches, Harry thought that\r\nher ladyship's beauty was very much injured by the small-pox. When\r\nthe marks of the disease cleared away, they did not, it is true, leave\r\nfurrows or scars on her face (except one, perhaps, on her forehead over\r\nher left eyebrow); but the delicacy of her rosy color and complexion was\r\ngone: her eyes had lost their brilliancy, her hair fell, and her face\r\nlooked older. It was as if a coarse hand had rubbed off the delicate\r\ntints of that sweet picture, and brought it, as one has seen unskilful\r\npainting-cleaners do, to the dead color. Also, it must be owned, that\r\nfor a year or two after the malady, her ladyship's nose was swollen and\r\nredder.\r\n\r\nThere would be no need to mention these trivialities, but that they\r\nactually influenced many lives, as trifles will in the world, where a\r\ngnat often plays a greater part than an elephant, and a mole-hill, as\r\nwe know in King William's case, can upset an empire. When Tusher in his\r\ncourtly way (at which Harry Esmond always chafed and spoke scornfully)\r\nvowed and protested that my lady's face was none the worse--the lad\r\nbroke out and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt IS worse and my mistress is not near so handsome\r\nas she was;\xe2\x80\x9d on which poor Lady Castlewood gave a rueful smile, and a\r\nlook into a little Venice glass she had, which showed her, I suppose,\r\nthat what the stupid boy said was only too true, for she turned away\r\nfrom the glass, and her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\nThe sight of these in Esmond's heart always created a sort of rage of\r\npity, and seeing them on the face of the lady whom he loved best, the\r\nyoung blunderer sank down on his knees, and besought her to pardon him,\r\nsaying that he was a fool and an idiot, that he was a brute to make such\r\na speech, he who had caused her malady; and Doctor Tusher told him that\r\na bear he was indeed, and a bear he would remain, at which speech poor\r\nyoung Esmond was so dumbstricken that he did not even growl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is MY bear, and I will not have him baited, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d my lady said,\r\npatting her hand kindly on the boy's head, as he was still kneeling at\r\nher feet. \xe2\x80\x9cHow your hair has come off! And mine, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with\r\nanother sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for myself that I cared,\xe2\x80\x9d my lady said to Harry, when the\r\nparson had taken his leave; \xe2\x80\x9cbut AM I very much changed? Alas! I fear\r\n'tis too true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, you have the dearest, and kindest, and sweetest face in the\r\nworld, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d the lad said; and indeed he thought and thinks so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill my lord think so when he comes back?\xe2\x80\x9d the lady asked with a sigh,\r\nand another look at her Venice glass. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose he should think as you\r\ndo, sir, that I am hideous--yes, you said hideous--he will cease to care\r\nfor me. 'Tis all men care for in women, our little beauty. Why did he\r\nselect me from among my sisters? 'Twas only for that. We reign but for a\r\nday or two: and be sure that Vashti knew Esther was coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cAhasuerus was the Grand Turk, and to change\r\nwas the manner of his country, and according to his law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are all Grand Turks for that matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady, \xe2\x80\x9cor would be if\r\nyou could. Come, Frank, come, my child. You are well, praised be Heaven.\r\nYOUR locks are not thinned by this dreadful small-pox: nor your poor\r\nface scarred--is it, my angel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank began to shout and whimper at the idea of such a misfortune. From\r\nthe very earliest time the young lord had been taught to admire his\r\nbeauty by his mother: and esteemed it as highly as any reigning toast\r\nvalued hers.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he himself was recovering from his fever and illness, a\r\npang of something like shame shot across young Esmond's breast, as he\r\nremembered that he had never once during his illness given a thought\r\nto the poor girl at the smithy, whose red cheeks but a month ago he\r\nhad been so eager to see. Poor Nancy! her cheeks had shared the fate of\r\nroses, and were withered now. She had taken the illness on the same day\r\nwith Esmond--she and her brother were both dead of the small-pox, and\r\nburied under the Castlewood yew-trees. There was no bright face looking\r\nnow from the garden, or to cheer the old smith at his lonely fireside.\r\nEsmond would have liked to have kissed her in her shroud (like the\r\nlass in Mr. Prior's pretty poem); but she rested many a foot below the\r\nground, when Esmond after his malady first trod on it.\r\n\r\nDoctor Tusher brought the news of this calamity, about which Harry\r\nEsmond longed to ask, but did not like. He said almost the whole village\r\nhad been stricken with the pestilence; seventeen persons were dead\r\nof it, among them mentioning the names of poor Nancy and her little\r\nbrother. He did not fail to say how thankful we survivors ought to be.\r\nIt being this man's business to flatter and make sermons, it must be\r\nowned he was most industrious in it, and was doing the one or the other\r\nall day.\r\n\r\nAnd so Nancy was gone; and Harry Esmond blushed that he had not a single\r\ntear for her, and fell to composing an elegy in Latin verses over the\r\nrustic little beauty. He bade the dryads mourn and the river-nymphs\r\ndeplore her. As her father followed the calling of Vulcan, he said that\r\nsurely she was like a daughter of Venus, though Sievewright's wife was\r\nan ugly shrew, as he remembered to have heard afterwards. He made a\r\nlong face, but, in truth, felt scarcely more sorrowful than a mute at a\r\nfuneral. These first passions of men and women are mostly abortive; and\r\nare dead almost before they are born. Esmond could repeat, to his last\r\nday, some of the doggerel lines in which his muse bewailed his pretty\r\nlass; not without shame to remember how bad the verses were, and how\r\ngood he thought them; how false the grief, and yet how he was rather\r\nproud of it. 'Tis an error, surely, to talk of the simplicity of youth.\r\nI think no persons are more hypocritical, and have a more affected\r\nbehavior to one another, than the young. They deceive themselves and\r\neach other with artifices that do not impose upon men of the world; and\r\nso we get to understand truth better, and grow simpler as we grow older.\r\n\r\nWhen my lady heard of the fate which had befallen poor Nancy, she said\r\nnothing so long as Tusher was by, but when he was gone, she took Harry\r\nEsmond's hand and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry, I beg your pardon for those cruel words I used on the night you\r\nwere taken ill. I am shocked at the fate of the poor creature, and\r\nam sure that nothing had happened of that with which, in my anger, I\r\ncharged you. And the very first day we go out, you must take me to the\r\nblacksmith, and we must see if there is anything I can do to console\r\nthe poor old man. Poor man! to lose both his children! What should I do\r\nwithout mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this was, indeed, the very first walk which my lady took, leaning on\r\nEsmond's arm, after her illness. But her visit brought no consolation to\r\nthe old father; and he showed no softness, or desire to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord\r\ngave and took away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and he knew what His servant's duty was.\r\nHe wanted for nothing--less now than ever before, as there were\r\nfewer mouths to feed. He wished her ladyship and Master Esmond good\r\nmorning--he had grown tall in his illness, and was but very little\r\nmarked; and with this, and a surly bow, he went in from the smithy to\r\nthe house, leaving my lady, somewhat silenced and shamefaced, at the\r\ndoor. He had a handsome stone put up for his two children, which may be\r\nseen in Castlewood churchyard to this very day; and before a year was\r\nout his own name was upon the stone. In the presence of Death, that\r\nsovereign ruler, a woman's coquetry is seared; and her jealousy will\r\nhardly pass the boundaries of that grim kingdom. 'Tis entirely of\r\nthe earth, that passion, and expires in the cold blue air, beyond our\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the danger was quite over, it was announced that my lord\r\nand his daughter would return. Esmond well remembered the day. The lady\r\nhis mistress was in a flurry of fear: before my lord came, she went into\r\nher room, and returned from it with reddened cheeks. Her fate was about\r\nto be decided. Her beauty was gone--was her reign, too, over? A minute\r\nwould say. My lord came riding over the bridge--he could be seen from\r\nthe great window, clad in scarlet, and mounted on his gray hackney--his\r\nlittle daughter ambled by him in a bright riding-dress of blue, on a\r\nshining chestnut horse. My lady leaned against the great mantel-piece,\r\nlooking on, with one hand on her heart--she seemed only the more pale\r\nfor those red marks on either cheek. She put her handkerchief to her\r\neyes, and withdrew it, laughing hysterically--the cloth was quite red\r\nwith the rouge when she took it away. She ran to her room again, and\r\ncame back with pale cheeks and red eyes--her son in her hand--just as my\r\nlord entered, accompanied by young Esmond, who had gone out to meet his\r\nprotector, and to hold his stirrup as he descended from horseback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Harry, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d my lord said, good-naturedly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look as gaunt as\r\na greyhound. The small-pox hasn't improved your beauty, and your side of\r\nthe house hadn't never too much of it--ho, ho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed, and sprang to the ground with no small agility, looking\r\nhandsome and red, within a jolly face and brown hair, like a Beef-eater;\r\nEsmond kneeling again, as soon as his patron had descended, performed\r\nhis homage, and then went to greet the little Beatrix, and help her from\r\nher horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie! how yellow you look,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand there are one, two, red\r\nholes in your face;\xe2\x80\x9d which, indeed, was very true; Harry Esmond's harsh\r\ncountenance bearing, as long as it continued to be a human face, the\r\nmarks of the disease.\r\n\r\nMy lord laughed again, in high good-humor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--- it!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with one of his usual oaths, \xe2\x80\x9cthe little slut sees\r\neverything. She saw the Dowager's paint t'other day, and asked her\r\nwhy she wore that red stuff--didn't you, Trix? and the Tower; and\r\nSt. James's; and the play; and the Prince George, and the Princess\r\nAnne--didn't you, Trix?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are both very fat, and smelt of brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d the child said.\r\n\r\nPapa roared with laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrandy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you know, Miss Pert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause your lordship smells of it after supper, when I embrace you\r\nbefore you go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady, who, indeed, was as pert\r\nas her father said, and looked as beautiful a little gipsy as eyes ever\r\ngazed on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now for my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord, going up the stairs, and passing\r\nunder the tapestry curtain that hung before the drawing-room door.\r\nEsmond remembered that noble figure, handsomely arrayed in scarlet.\r\nWithin the last few months he himself had grown from a boy to be a man,\r\nand with his figure his thoughts had shot up, and grown manly.\r\n\r\nMy lady's countenance, of which Harry Esmond was accustomed to watch the\r\nchanges, and with a solicitous affection to note and interpret the signs\r\nof gladness or care, wore a sad and depressed look for many weeks\r\nafter her lord's return: during which it seemed as if, by caresses and\r\nentreaties, she strove to win him back from some ill humor he had, and\r\nwhich he did not choose to throw off. In her eagerness to please him she\r\npractised a hundred of those arts which had formerly charmed him, but\r\nwhich seemed now to have lost their potency. Her songs did not amuse\r\nhim; and she hushed them and the children when in his presence. My lord\r\nsat silent at his dinner, drinking greatly, his lady opposite to him,\r\nlooking furtively at his face, though also speechless. Her silence\r\nannoyed him as much as her speech; and he would peevishly, and with an\r\noath, ask her why she held her tongue and looked so glum; or he would\r\nroughly check her when speaking, and bid her not talk nonsense. It\r\nseemed as if, since his return, nothing she could do or say could please\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen a master and mistress are at strife in a house, the subordinates\r\nin the family take the one side or the other. Harry Esmond stood in\r\nso great fear of my lord, that he would run a league barefoot to do a\r\nmessage for him; but his attachment for Lady Esmond was such a passion\r\nof grateful regard, that to spare her a grief, or to do her a service,\r\nhe would have given his life daily: and it was by the very depth and\r\nintensity of this regard that he began to divine how unhappy his adored\r\nlady's life was, and that a secret care (for she never spoke of her\r\nanxieties) was weighing upon her.\r\n\r\nCan any one, who has passed through the world and watched the nature\r\nof men and women there, doubt what had befallen her? I have seen, to be\r\nsure, some people carry down with them into old age the actual bloom\r\nof their youthful love, and I know that Mr. Thomas Parr lived to be a\r\nhundred and sixty years old. But, for all that, threescore and ten is\r\nthe age of men, and few get beyond it; and 'tis certain that a man who\r\nmarries for mere beaux yeux, as my lord did, considers this part of the\r\ncontract at an end when the woman ceases to fulfil hers, and his love\r\ndoes not survive her beauty. I know 'tis often otherwise, I say; and can\r\nthink (as most men in their own experience may) of many a house,\r\nwhere, lighted in early years, the sainted lamp of love hath never been\r\nextinguished; but so there is Mr. Parr, and so there is the great giant\r\nat the fair that is eight feet high--exceptions to men--and that poor\r\nlamp whereof I speak, that lights at first the nuptial chamber, is\r\nextinguished by a hundred winds and draughts down the chimney, or\r\nsputters out for want of feeding. And then--and then it is Chloe, in the\r\ndark, stark awake, and Strephon snoring unheeding; or vice versa, 'tis\r\npoor Strephon that has married a heartless jilt, and awoke out of that\r\nabsurd vision of conjugal felicity, which was to last for ever, and is\r\nover like any other dream. One and other has made his bed, and so must\r\nlie in it, until that final day when life ends, and they sleep separate.\r\n\r\nAbout this time young Esmond, who had a knack of stringing verses,\r\nturned some of Ovid's Epistles into rhymes, and brought them to his lady\r\nfor her delectation. Those which treated of forsaken women touched her\r\nimmensely, Harry remarked; and when Oenone called after Paris, and Medea\r\nbade Jason come back again, the lady of Castlewood sighed, and said she\r\nthought that part of the verses was the most pleasing. Indeed, she would\r\nhave chopped up the Dean, her old father, in order to bring her husband\r\nback again. But her beautiful Jason was gone, as beautiful Jasons will\r\ngo, and the poor enchantress had never a spell to keep him.\r\n\r\nMy lord was only sulky as long as his wife's anxious face or behavior\r\nseemed to upbraid him. When she had got to master these, and to show an\r\noutwardly cheerful countenance and behavior, her husband's good-humor\r\nreturned partially, and he swore and stormed no longer at dinner, but\r\nlaughed sometimes, and yawned unrestrainedly; absenting himself often\r\nfrom home, inviting more company thither, passing the greater part of\r\nhis days in the hunting-field, or over the bottle as before; but with\r\nthis difference, that the poor wife could no longer see now, as she had\r\ndone formerly, the light of love kindled in his eyes. He was with her,\r\nbut that flame was out: and that once welcome beacon no more shone\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWhat were this lady's feelings when forced to admit the truth whereof\r\nher foreboding glass had given her only too true warning, that within\r\nher beauty her reign had ended, and the days of her love were over?\r\nWhat does a seaman do in a storm if mast and rudder are carried away? He\r\nships a jurymast, and steers as he best can with an oar. What happens if\r\nyour roof falls in a tempest? After the first stun of the calamity the\r\nsufferer starts up, gropes around to see that the children are safe, and\r\nputs them under a shed out of the rain. If the palace burns down, you\r\ntake shelter in the barn. What man's life is not overtaken by one or\r\nmore of these tornadoes that send us out of the course, and fling us on\r\nrocks to shelter as best we may?\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Castlewood found that her great ship had gone down, she began\r\nas best she might after she had rallied from the effects of the loss,\r\nto put out small ventures of happiness; and hope for little gains and\r\nreturns, as a merchant on 'Change, indocilis pauperiem pati, having lost\r\nhis thousands, embarks a few guineas upon the next ship. She laid out\r\nher all upon her children, indulging them beyond all measure, as was\r\ninevitable with one of her kindness of disposition; giving all her\r\nthoughts to their welfare--learning, that she might teach them; and\r\nimproving her own many natural gifts and feminine accomplishments, that\r\nshe might impart them to her young ones. To be doing good for some one\r\nelse, is the life of most good women. They are exuberant of kindness, as\r\nit were, and must impart it to some one. She made herself a good scholar\r\nof French, Italian, and Latin, having been grounded in these by her\r\nfather in her youth; hiding these gifts from her husband out of fear,\r\nperhaps, that they should offend him, for my lord was no bookman--pish'd\r\nand psha'd at the notion of learned ladies, and would have been angry\r\nthat his wife could construe out of a Latin book of which he could\r\nscarce understand two words. Young Esmond was usher, or house tutor,\r\nunder her or over her, as it might happen. During my lord's many\r\nabsences, these school-days would go on uninterruptedly: the mother\r\nand daughter learning with surprising quickness; the latter by fits and\r\nstarts only, and as suited her wayward humor. As for the little lord,\r\nit must be owned that he took after his father in the matter of\r\nlearning--liked marbles and play, and the great horse and the little one\r\nwhich his father brought him, and on which he took him out a-hunting, a\r\ngreat deal better than Corderius and Lily; marshalled the village boys,\r\nand had a little court of them, already flogging them, and domineering\r\nover them with a fine imperious spirit, that made his father laugh when\r\nhe beheld it, and his mother fondly warn him. The cook had a son, the\r\nwoodman had two, the big lad at the porter's lodge took his cuffs\r\nand his orders. Doctor Tusher said he was a young nobleman of gallant\r\nspirit; and Harry Esmond, who was his tutor, and eight years his little\r\nlordship's senior, had hard work sometimes to keep his own temper, and\r\nhold his authority over his rebellious little chief and kinsman.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of years after that calamity had befallen which had robbed\r\nLady Castlewood of a little--a very little--of her beauty, and her\r\ncareless husband's heart (if the truth must be told, my lady had found\r\nnot only that her reign was over, but that her successor was appointed,\r\na Princess of a noble house in Drury Lane somewhere, who was installed\r\nand visited by my lord at the town eight miles off--pudet haec opprobria\r\ndicere nobis)--a great change had taken place in her mind, which, by\r\nstruggles only known to herself, at least never mentioned to any one,\r\nand unsuspected by the person who caused the pain she endured--had\r\nbeen schooled into such a condition as she could not very likely have\r\nimagined possible a score of months since, before her misfortunes had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nShe had oldened in that time as people do who suffer silently great\r\nmental pain; and learned much that she had never suspected before. She\r\nwas taught by that bitter teacher Misfortune. A child the mother of\r\nother children, but two years back her lord was a god to her; his words\r\nher law; his smile her sunshine; his lazy commonplaces listened to\r\neagerly, as if they were words of wisdom--all his wishes and freaks\r\nobeyed with a servile devotion. She had been my lord's chief slave and\r\nblind worshipper. Some women bear farther than this, and submit not only\r\nto neglect but to unfaithfulness too--but here this lady's allegiance\r\nhad failed her. Her spirit rebelled, and disowned any more obedience.\r\nFirst she had to bear in secret the passion of losing the adored object;\r\nthen to get further initiation, and to find this worshipped being was\r\nbut a clumsy idol: then to admit the silent truth, that it was she was\r\nsuperior, and not the monarch her master: that she had thoughts which\r\nhis brains could never master, and was the better of the two; quite\r\nseparate from my lord although tied to him, and bound, as almost all\r\npeople (save a very happy few), to work all her life alone. My lord sat\r\nin his chair, laughing his laugh, cracking his joke, his face flushing\r\nwith wine--my lady in her place over against him--he never suspecting\r\nthat his superior was there, in the calm resigned lady, cold of manner,\r\nwith downcast eyes. When he was merry in his cups, he would make jokes\r\nabout her coldness, and, \xe2\x80\x9cD--- it, now my lady is gone, we will have\r\nt'other bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. He was frank enough in telling his\r\nthoughts, such as they were. There was little mystery about my lord's\r\nwords or actions. His Fair Rosamond did not live in a Labyrinth, like\r\nthe lady of Mr. Addison's opera, but paraded with painted cheeks and a\r\ntipsy retinue in the country town. Had she a mind to be revenged, Lady\r\nCastlewood could have found the way to her rival's house easily enough;\r\nand, if she had come with bowl and dagger, would have been routed off\r\nthe ground by the enemy with a volley of Billingsgate, which the fair\r\nperson always kept by her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it has been said, that for Harry Esmond his benefactress's\r\nsweet face had lost none of its charms. It had always the kindest of\r\nlooks and smiles for him--smiles, not so gay and artless perhaps as\r\nthose which Lady Castlewood had formerly worn, when, a child herself,\r\nplaying with her children, her husband's pleasure and authority were all\r\nshe thought of; but out of her griefs and cares, as will happen I think\r\nwhen these trials fall upon a kindly heart, and are not too unbearable,\r\ngrew up a number of thoughts and excellences which had never come into\r\nexistence, had not her sorrow and misfortunes engendered them. Sure,\r\noccasion is the father of most that is good in us. As you have seen the\r\nawkward fingers and clumsy tools of a prisoner cut and fashion the most\r\ndelicate little pieces of carved work; or achieve the most prodigious\r\nunderground labors, and cut through walls of masonry, and saw iron bars\r\nand fetters; 'tis misfortune that awakens ingenuity, or fortitude, or\r\nendurance, in hearts where these qualities had never come to life but\r\nfor the circumstance which gave them a being.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Twas after Jason left her, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Castlewood once said with\r\none of her smiles to young Esmond (who was reading to her a version of\r\ncertain lines out of Euripides), \xe2\x80\x9cthat Medea became a learned woman and\r\na great enchantress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she could conjure the stars out of heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d the young tutor added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut she could not bring Jason back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my lady, very angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I mean nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9csave what I've read in books.\r\nWhat should I know about such matters? I have seen no woman save you\r\nand little Beatrix, and the parson's wife and my late mistress, and your\r\nladyship's woman here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men who wrote your books,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, \xe2\x80\x9cyour Horaces, and Ovids,\r\nand Virgils, as far as I know of them, all thought ill of us, as all\r\nthe heroes they wrote about used us basely. We were bred to be slaves\r\nalways; and even of our own times, as you are still the only lawgivers,\r\nI think our sermons seem to say that the best woman is she who bears\r\nher master's chains most gracefully. 'Tis a pity there are no nunneries\r\npermitted by our church: Beatrix and I would fly to one, and end our\r\ndays in peace there away from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is there no slavery in a convent?\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least if women are slaves there, no one sees them,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nlady. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don't work in street gangs with the public to jeer them: and\r\nif they suffer, suffer in private. Here comes my lord home from hunting.\r\nTake away the books. My lord does not love to see them. Lessons are over\r\nfor to-day, Mr. Tutor.\xe2\x80\x9d And with a curtsy and a smile she would end this\r\nsort of colloquy.\r\n\r\nIndeed \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Tutor,\xe2\x80\x9d as my lady called Esmond, had now business enough on\r\nhis hands in Castlewood house. He had three pupils, his lady and her two\r\nchildren, at whose lessons she would always be present; besides writing\r\nmy lord's letters, and arranging his accompts for him--when these could\r\nbe got from Esmond's indolent patron.\r\n\r\nOf the pupils the two young people were but lazy scholars, and as my\r\nlady would admit no discipline such as was then in use, my lord's son\r\nonly learned what he liked, which was but little, and never to his\r\nlife's end could be got to construe more than six lines of Virgil.\r\nMistress Beatrix chattered French prettily, from a very early age;\r\nand sang sweetly, but this was from her mother's teaching--not Harry\r\nEsmond's, who could scarce distinguish between \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Sleeves\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLillibullero;\xe2\x80\x9d although he had no greater delight in life than to hear\r\nthe ladies sing. He sees them now (will he ever forget them?) as they\r\nused to sit together of the summer evenings--the two golden heads over\r\nthe page--the child's little hand, and the mother's beating the time,\r\nwith their voices rising and falling in unison.\r\n\r\nBut if the children were careless, 'twas a wonder how eagerly the\r\nmother learnt from her young tutor--and taught him too. The happiest\r\ninstinctive faculty was this lady's--a faculty for discerning latent\r\nbeauties and hidden graces of books, especially books of poetry, as in a\r\nwalk she would spy out field-flowers and make posies of them, such as\r\nno other hand could. She was a critic, not by reason but by feeling; the\r\nsweetest commentator of those books they read together; and the happiest\r\nhours of young Esmond's life, perhaps, were those passed in the company\r\nof this kind mistress and her children.\r\n\r\nThese happy days were to end soon, however; and it was by the Lady\r\nCastlewood's own decree that they were brought to a conclusion. It\r\nhappened about Christmas-time, Harry Esmond being now past sixteen\r\nyears of age, that his old comrade, adversary, and friend, Tom Tusher,\r\nreturned from his school in London, a fair, well-grown, and sturdy lad,\r\nwho was about to enter college, with an exhibition from his school, and\r\na prospect of after promotion in the church. Tom Tusher's talk was of\r\nnothing but Cambridge now; and the boys, who were good friends, examined\r\neach other eagerly about their progress in books. Tom had learned some\r\nGreek and Hebrew, besides Latin, in which he was pretty well skilled,\r\nand also had given himself to mathematical studies under his father's\r\nguidance, who was a proficient in those sciences, of which Esmond knew\r\nnothing; nor could he write Latin so well as Tom, though he could talk\r\nit better, having been taught by his dear friend the Jesuit Father, for\r\nwhose memory the lad ever retained the warmest affection, reading his\r\nbooks, keeping his swords clean in the little crypt where the Father\r\nhad shown them to Esmond on the night of his visit; and often of a night\r\nsitting in the chaplain's room, which he inhabited, over his books, his\r\nverses, and rubbish, with which the lad occupied himself, he would look\r\nup at the window, thinking he wished it might open and let in the good\r\nFather. He had come and passed away like a dream; but for the swords\r\nand books Harry might almost think the Father was an imagination of his\r\nmind--and for two letters which had come to him, one from abroad, full\r\nof advice and affection, another soon after he had been confirmed by the\r\nBishop of Hexton, in which Father Holt deplored his falling away. But\r\nHarry Esmond felt so confident now of his being in the right, and of his\r\nown powers as a casuist, that he thought he was able to face the Father\r\nhimself in argument, and possibly convert him.\r\n\r\nTo work upon the faith of her young pupil, Esmond's kind mistress sent\r\nto the library of her father the Dean, who had been distinguished in the\r\ndisputes of the late king's reign; and, an old soldier now, had hung\r\nup his weapons of controversy. These he took down from his shelves\r\nwillingly for young Esmond, whom he benefited by his own personal advice\r\nand instruction. It did not require much persuasion to induce the boy\r\nto worship with his beloved mistress. And the good old nonjuring Dean\r\nflattered himself with a conversion which, in truth, was owing to a much\r\ngentler and fairer persuader.\r\n\r\nUnder her ladyship's kind eyes (my lord's being sealed in sleep pretty\r\ngenerally), Esmond read many volumes of the works of the famous British\r\nDivines of the last age, and was familiar with Wake and Sherlock, with\r\nStillingfleet and Patrick. His mistress never tired to listen or to\r\nread, to pursue the texts with fond comments, to urge those points which\r\nher fancy dwelt on most, or her reason deemed most important. Since the\r\ndeath of her father the Dean, this lady hath admitted a certain latitude\r\nof theological reading which her orthodox father would never have\r\nallowed; his favorite writers appealing more to reason and antiquity\r\nthan to the passions or imaginations of their readers, so that the works\r\nof Bishop Taylor, nay, those of Mr. Baxter and Mr. Law, have in reality\r\nfound more favor with my Lady Castlewood than the severer volumes of our\r\ngreat English schoolmen.\r\n\r\nIn later life, at the University, Esmond reopened the controversy, and\r\npursued it in a very different manner, when his patrons had determined\r\nfor him that he was to embrace the ecclesiastical life. But though his\r\nmistress's heart was in this calling, his own never was much. After that\r\nfirst fervor of simple devotion, which his beloved Jesuit priest had\r\ninspired in him, speculative theology took but little hold upon the\r\nyoung man's mind. When his early credulity was disturbed, and his saints\r\nand virgins taken out of his worship, to rank little higher than the\r\ndivinities of Olympus, his belief became acquiescence rather than ardor;\r\nand he made his mind up to assume the cassock and bands, as another\r\nman does to wear a breastplate and jack-boots, or to mount a merchant's\r\ndesk, for a livelihood, and from obedience and necessity, rather than\r\nfrom choice. There were scores of such men in Mr. Esmond's time at the\r\nuniversities, who were going to the church with no better calling than\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Tusher was gone, a feeling of no small depression and\r\ndisquiet fell upon young Esmond, of which, though he did not complain,\r\nhis kind mistress must have divined the cause: for soon after she showed\r\nnot only that she understood the reason of Harry's melancholy, but could\r\nprovide a remedy for it. Her habit was thus to watch, unobservedly,\r\nthose to whom duty or affection bound her, and to prevent their\r\ndesigns, or to fulfil them, when she had the power. It was this lady's\r\ndisposition to think kindnesses, and devise silent bounties and to\r\nscheme benevolence, for those about her. We take such goodness, for the\r\nmost part, as if it was our due; the Marys who bring ointment for our\r\nfeet get but little thanks. Some of us never feel this devotion at all,\r\nor are moved by it to gratitude or acknowledgment; others only recall it\r\nyears after, when the days are past in which those sweet kindnesses were\r\nspent on us, and we offer back our return for the debt by a poor tardy\r\npayment of tears. Then forgotten tones of love recur to us, and kind\r\nglances shine out of the past--oh so bright and clear!--oh so longed\r\nafter!--because they are out of reach; as holiday music from withinside\r\na prison wall--or sunshine seen through the bars; more prized because\r\nunattainable--more bright because of the contrast of present darkness\r\nand solitude, whence there is no escape.\r\n\r\nAll the notice, then, which Lady Castlewood seemed to take of Harry\r\nEsmond's melancholy, upon Tom Tusher's departure, was, by a gayety\r\nunusual to her, to attempt to dispel his gloom. She made his three\r\nscholars (herself being the chief one) more cheerful than ever they had\r\nbeen before, and more docile, too, all of them learning and reading\r\nmuch more than they had been accustomed to do. \xe2\x80\x9cFor who knows,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe lady, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat may happen, and whether we may be able to keep such a\r\nlearned tutor long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank Esmond said he for his part did not want to learn any more, and\r\ncousin Harry might shut up his book whenever he liked, if he would\r\ncome out a-fishing; and little Beatrix declared she would send for Tom\r\nTusher, and HE would be glad enough to come to Castlewood, if Harry\r\nchose to go away.\r\n\r\nAt last comes a messenger from Winchester one day, bearer of a letter,\r\nwith a great black seal, from the Dean there, to say that his sister\r\nwas dead, and had left her fortune of 2,000L. among her six nieces, the\r\nDean's daughters; and many a time since has Harry Esmond recalled the\r\nflushed face and eager look wherewith, after this intelligence, his kind\r\nlady regarded him. She did not pretend to any grief about the deceased\r\nrelative, from whom she and her family had been many years parted.\r\n\r\nWhen my lord heard of the news, he also did not make any very long\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cThe money will come very handy to furnish the music-room and the\r\ncellar, which is getting low, and buy your ladyship a coach and a\r\ncouple of horses that will do indifferent to ride or for the coach. And,\r\nBeatrix, you shall have a spinnet: and, Frank, you shall have a little\r\nhorse from Hexton Fair; and, Harry, you shall have five pounds to buy\r\nsome books,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord, who was generous with his own, and indeed\r\nwith other folk's money. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish your aunt would die once a year,\r\nRachel; we could spend your money, and all your sisters', too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have but one aunt--and--and I have another use for the money, my\r\nlord,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, turning very red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother use, my dear; and what do you know about money?\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what the devil is there that I don't give you which you want!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intend to give this money--can't you fancy how, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord swore one of his large oaths that he did not know in the least\r\nwhat she meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intend it for Harry Esmond to go to college. Cousin Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d says my\r\nlady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mustn't stay longer in this dull place, but make a name to\r\nyourself, and for us too, Harry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n it, Harry's well enough here,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, for a moment looking\r\nrather sulky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Harry going away? You don't mean to say you will go away?\xe2\x80\x9d cry out\r\nFrank and Beatrix at one breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will come back: and this will always be his home,\xe2\x80\x9d cries my\r\nlady, with blue eyes looking a celestial kindness: \xe2\x80\x9cand his scholars\r\nwill always love him; won't they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G-d, Rachel, you're a good woman!\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, seizing my lady's\r\nhand, at which she blushed very much, and shrank back, putting her\r\nchildren before her. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you joy, my kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, giving\r\nHarry Esmond a hearty slap on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI won't balk your luck. Go\r\nto Cambridge, boy, and when Tusher dies you shall have the living\r\nhere, if you are not better provided by that time. We'll furnish the\r\ndining-room and buy the horses another year. I'll give thee a nag out\r\nof the stable: take any one except my hack and the bay gelding and the\r\ncoach-horses; and God speed thee, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the sorrel, Harry; 'tis a good one. Father says 'tis the best\r\nin the stable,\xe2\x80\x9d says little Frank, clapping his hands, and jumping up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's come and see him in the stable.\xe2\x80\x9d And the other, in his delight\r\nand eagerness, was for leaving the room that instant to arrange about\r\nhis journey.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Castlewood looked after him with sad penetrating glances. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nwishes to be gone already, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to her husband.\r\n\r\nThe young man hung back abashed. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I would stay for ever, if your\r\nladyship bade me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou wouldst be a fool for thy pains, kinsman,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cTut,\r\ntut, man. Go and see the world. Sow thy wild oats; and take the best\r\nluck that Fate sends thee. I wish I were a boy again, that I might go to\r\ncollege, and taste the Trumpington ale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOurs, indeed, is but a dull home,\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lady, with a little of\r\nsadness and, maybe, of satire, in her voice: \xe2\x80\x9can old glum house, half\r\nruined, and the rest only half furnished; a woman and two children are\r\nbut poor company for men that are accustomed to better. We are only fit\r\nto be your worship's handmaids, and your pleasures must of necessity lie\r\nelsewhere than at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse me, Rachel, if I know now whether thou art in earnest or not,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn earnest, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d says she, still clinging by one of her children.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there much subject here for joke?\xe2\x80\x9d And she made him a grand curtsy,\r\nand, giving a stately look to Harry Esmond, which seemed to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember; you understand me, though he does not,\xe2\x80\x9d she left the room\r\nwith her children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince she found out that confounded Hexton business,\xe2\x80\x9d my lord\r\nsaid--\xe2\x80\x9cand be hanged to them that told her!--she has not been the same\r\nwoman. She, who used to be as humble as a milkmaid, is as proud as a\r\nprincess,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my counsel, Harry Esmond, and keep clear\r\nof women. Since I have had anything to do with the jades, they have\r\ngiven me nothing but disgust. I had a wife at Tangier, with whom, as she\r\ncouldn't speak a word of my language, you'd have thought I might lead a\r\nquiet life. But she tried to poison me, because she was jealous of a Jew\r\ngirl. There was your aunt, for aunt she is--aunt Jezebel, a pretty\r\nlife your father led with HER! and here's my lady. When I saw her on a\r\npillion, riding behind the Dean her father, she looked and was such a\r\nbaby, that a sixpenny doll might have pleased her. And now you see what\r\nshe is--hands off, highty-tighty, high and mighty, an empress couldn't\r\nbe grander. Pass us the tankard, Harry my boy. A mug of beer and a toast\r\nat morn, says my host. A toast and a mug of beer at noon, says my dear.\r\nD--n it, Polly loves a mug of ale, too, and laced with brandy, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Indeed, I suppose they drank it together; for my lord was often thick\r\nin his speech at mid-day dinner; and at night at supper, speechless\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond's departure resolved upon, it seemed as if the Lady\r\nCastlewood, too, rejoiced to lose him; for more than once, when the\r\nlad, ashamed perhaps at his own secret eagerness to go away (at any\r\nrate stricken with sadness at the idea of leaving those from whom he\r\nhad received so many proofs of love and kindness inestimable), tried to\r\nexpress to his mistress his sense of gratitude to her, and his sorrow at\r\nquitting those who had so sheltered and tended a nameless and houseless\r\norphan, Lady Castlewood cut short his protests of love and his\r\nlamentations, and would hear of no grief, but only look forward to\r\nHarry's fame and prospects in life. \xe2\x80\x9cOur little legacy will keep you\r\nfor four years like a gentleman. Heaven's Providence, your own genius,\r\nindustry, honor, must do the rest for you. Castlewood will always be a\r\nhome for you; and these children, whom you have taught and loved, will\r\nnot forget to love you. And, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d said she (and this was the only\r\ntime when she spoke with a tear in her eye, or a tremor in her voice),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit may happen in the course of nature that I shall be called away\r\nfrom them: and their father--and--and they will need true friends and\r\nprotectors. Promise me that you will be true to them--as--as I think I\r\nhave been to you--and a mother's fond prayer and blessing go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo help me God, madam, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry Esmond, falling on his\r\nknees, and kissing the hand of his dearest mistress. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will have\r\nme stay now, I will. What matters whether or no I make my way in life,\r\nor whether a poor bastard dies as unknown as he is now? 'Tis enough\r\nthat I have your love and kindness surely; and to make you happy is duty\r\nenough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy!\xe2\x80\x9d says she; \xe2\x80\x9cbut indeed I ought to be, with my children, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot happy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Esmond (for he knew what her life was, though he and\r\nhis mistress never spoke a word concerning it). \xe2\x80\x9cIf not happiness,\r\nit may be ease. Let me stay and work for you--let me stay and be your\r\nservant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, you are best away,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady, laughing, as she put her hand\r\non the boy's head for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall stay in no such dull place.\r\nYou shall go to college and distinguish yourself as becomes your name.\r\nThat is how you shall please me best; and--and if my children want you,\r\nor I want you, you shall come to us; and I know we may count on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay heaven forsake me if you may not!\xe2\x80\x9d Harry said, getting up from his\r\nknee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my knight longs for a dragon this instant that he may fight,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nmy lady, laughing; which speech made Harry Esmond start, and turn red;\r\nfor indeed the very thought was in his mind, that he would like\r\nthat some chance should immediately happen whereby he might show his\r\ndevotion. And it pleased him to think that his lady had called him \xe2\x80\x9cher\r\nknight,\xe2\x80\x9d and often and often he recalled this to his mind, and prayed\r\nthat he might be her true knight, too.\r\n\r\nMy lady's bed-chamber window looked out over the country, and you could\r\nsee from it the purple hills beyond Castlewood village, the green common\r\nbetwixt that and the Hall, and the old bridge which crossed over the\r\nriver. When Harry Esmond went away for Cambridge, little Frank ran\r\nalongside his horse as far as the bridge, and there Harry stopped for a\r\nmoment, and looked back at the house where the best part of his life had\r\nbeen passed. It lay before him with its gray familiar towers, a pinnacle\r\nor two shining in the sun, the buttresses and terrace walls casting\r\ngreat blue shades on the grass. And Harry remembered, all his life\r\nafter, how he saw his mistress at the window looking out on him in a\r\nwhite robe, the little Beatrix's chestnut curls resting at her mother's\r\nside. Both waved a farewell to him, and little Frank sobbed to leave\r\nhim. Yes, he WOULD be his lady's true knight, he vowed in his heart; he\r\nwaved her an adieu with his hat. The village people had Good-by to say\r\nto him too. All knew that Master Harry was going to college, and most of\r\nthem had a kind word and a look of farewell. I do not stop to say what\r\nadventures he began to imagine, or what career to devise for himself\r\nbefore he had ridden three miles from home. He had not read Monsieur\r\nGalland's ingenious Arabian tales as yet; but be sure that there are\r\nother folks who build castles in the air, and have fine hopes, and kick\r\nthem down too, besides honest Alnaschar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nI GO TO CAMBRIDGE, AND DO BUT LITTLE GOOD THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr lord, who said he should like to revisit the old haunts of his youth,\r\nkindly accompanied Harry Esmond in his first journey to Cambridge. Their\r\nroad lay through London, where my Lord Viscount would also have Harry\r\nstay a few days to show him the pleasures of the town before he entered\r\nupon his university studies, and whilst here Harry's patron conducted\r\nthe young man to my Lady Dowager's house at Chelsey near London:\r\nthe kind lady at Castlewood having specially ordered that the young\r\ngentleman and the old should pay a respectful visit in that quarter.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship the Viscountess Dowager occupied a handsome new house in\r\nChelsey, with a garden behind it, and facing the river, always a bright\r\nand animated sight with its swarms of sailors, barges, and wherries.\r\nHarry laughed at recognizing in the parlor the well-remembered old\r\npiece of Sir Peter Lely, wherein his father's widow was represented as\r\na virgin huntress, armed with a gilt bow-and-arrow, and encumbered only\r\nwith that small quantity of drapery which it would seem the virgins in\r\nKing Charles's day were accustomed to wear.\r\n\r\nMy Lady Dowager had left off this peculiar habit of huntress when she\r\nmarried. But though she was now considerably past sixty years of age, I\r\nbelieve she thought that airy nymph of the picture could still be easily\r\nrecognized in the venerable personage who gave an audience to Harry and\r\nhis patron.\r\n\r\nShe received the young man with even more favor than she showed to the\r\nelder, for she chose to carry on the conversation in French, in which my\r\nLord Castlewood was no great proficient, and expressed her satisfaction\r\nat finding that Mr. Esmond could speak fluently in that language. \xe2\x80\x9c'Twas\r\nthe only one fit for polite conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d she condescended to say, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nsuitable to persons of high breeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord laughed afterwards, as the gentlemen went away, at his\r\nkinswoman's behavior. He said he remembered the time when she could\r\nspeak English fast enough, and joked in his jolly way at the loss he had\r\nhad of such a lovely wife as that.\r\n\r\nMy Lady Viscountess deigned to ask his lordship news of his wife and\r\nchildren; she had heard that Lady Castlewood had had the small-pox; she\r\nhoped she was not so VERY much disfigured as people said.\r\n\r\nAt this remark about his wife's malady, my Lord Viscount winced and\r\nturned red; but the Dowager, in speaking of the disfigurement of the\r\nyoung lady, turned to her looking-glass and examined her old wrinkled\r\ncountenance in it with such a grin of satisfaction, that it was all her\r\nguests could do to refrain from laughing in her ancient face.\r\n\r\nShe asked Harry what his profession was to be; and my lord, saying that\r\nthe lad was to take orders, and have the living of Castlewood when old\r\nDr. Tusher vacated it, she did not seem to show any particular anger at\r\nthe notion of Harry's becoming a Church of England clergyman, nay, was\r\nrather glad than otherwise, that the youth should be so provided for.\r\nShe bade Mr. Esmond not to forget to pay her a visit whenever he passed\r\nthrough London, and carried her graciousness so far as to send a purse\r\nwith twenty guineas for him, to the tavern at which my lord put up (the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreyhound,\xe2\x80\x9d in Charing Cross); and, along with this welcome gift for\r\nher kinsman, she sent a little doll for a present to my lord's little\r\ndaughter Beatrix, who was growing beyond the age of dolls by this time,\r\nand was as tall almost as her venerable relative.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the town, and going to the plays, my Lord Castlewood and\r\nEsmond rode together to Cambridge, spending two pleasant days upon the\r\njourney. Those rapid new coaches were not established, as yet, that\r\nperformed the whole journey between London and the University in a\r\nsingle day; however, the road was pleasant and short enough to Harry\r\nEsmond, and he always gratefully remembered that happy holiday which his\r\nkind patron gave him.\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond was entered a pensioner of Trinity College in Cambridge,\r\nto which famous college my lord had also in his youth belonged. Dr.\r\nMontague was master at this time, and received my Lord Viscount with\r\ngreat politeness: so did Mr. Bridge, who was appointed to be Harry's\r\ntutor. Tom Tusher, who was of Emanuel College, and was by this time\r\na junior soph, came to wait upon my lord, and to take Harry under his\r\nprotection; and comfortable rooms being provided for him in the great\r\ncourt close by the gate, and near to the famous Mr. Newton's lodgings,\r\nHarry's patron took leave of him with many kind words and blessings,\r\nand an admonition to him to behave better at the University than my lord\r\nhimself had ever done.\r\n\r\n'Tis needless in these memoirs to go at any length into the particulars\r\nof Harry Esmond's college career. It was like that of a hundred young\r\ngentlemen of that day. But he had the ill fortune to be older by a\r\ncouple of years than most of his fellow-students; and by his previous\r\nsolitary mode of bringing up, the circumstances of his life, and the\r\npeculiar thoughtfulness and melancholy that had naturally engendered, he\r\nwas, in a great measure, cut off from the society of comrades who were\r\nmuch younger and higher-spirited than he. His tutor, who had bowed\r\ndown to the ground, as he walked my lord over the college grass-plats,\r\nchanged his behavior as soon as the nobleman's back was turned, and\r\nwas--at least Harry thought so--harsh and overbearing. When the lads\r\nused to assemble in their greges in hall, Harry found himself alone in\r\nthe midst of that little flock of boys; they raised a great laugh at\r\nhim when he was set on to read Latin, which he did with the foreign\r\npronunciation taught to him by his old master, the Jesuit, than which\r\nhe knew no other. Mr. Bridge, the tutor, made him the object of clumsy\r\njokes, in which he was fond of indulging. The young man's spirit was\r\nchafed, and his vanity mortified; and he found himself, for some time,\r\nas lonely in this place as ever he had been at Castlewood, whither he\r\nlonged to return. His birth was a source of shame to him, and he fancied\r\na hundred slights and sneers from young and old, who, no doubt, had\r\ntreated him better had he met them himself more frankly. And as he looks\r\nback, in calmer days, upon this period of his life, which he thought so\r\nunhappy, he can see that his own pride and vanity caused no small part\r\nof the mortifications which he attributed to other's ill will. The world\r\ndeals good-naturedly with good-natured people, and I never knew a sulky\r\nmisanthropist who quarrelled with it, but it was he, and not it, that\r\nwas in the wrong. Tom Tusher gave Harry plenty of good advice on this\r\nsubject, for Tom had both good sense and good humor; but Mr. Harry chose\r\nto treat his senior with a great deal of superfluous disdain and absurd\r\nscorn, and would by no means part from his darling injuries, in which,\r\nvery likely, no man believed but himself. As for honest Doctor Bridge,\r\nthe tutor found, after a few trials of wit with the pupil, that the\r\nyoung man was an ugly subject for wit, and that the laugh was often\r\nturned against him. This did not make tutor and pupil any better\r\nfriends; but had, so far, an advantage for Esmond, that Mr. Bridge was\r\ninduced to leave him alone; and so long as he kept his chapels, and did\r\nthe college exercises required of him, Bridge was content not to see\r\nHarry's glum face in his class, and to leave him to read and sulk for\r\nhimself in his own chamber.\r\n\r\nA poem or two in Latin and English, which were pronounced to have some\r\nmerit, and a Latin oration, (for Mr. Esmond could write that language\r\nbetter than pronounce it,) got him a little reputation both with the\r\nauthorities of the University and amongst the young men, with whom he\r\nbegan to pass for more than he was worth. A few victories over their\r\ncommon enemy, Mr. Bridge, made them incline towards him, and look upon\r\nhim as the champion of their order against the seniors. Such of the lads\r\nas he took into his confidence found him not so gloomy and haughty as\r\nhis appearance led them to believe; and Don Dismallo, as he was called,\r\nbecame presently a person of some little importance in his college, and\r\nwas, as he believes, set down by the seniors there as rather a dangerous\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nDon Dismallo was a staunch young Jacobite, like the rest of his family;\r\ngave himself many absurd airs of loyalty; used to invite young friends\r\nto Burgundy, and give the King's health on King James's birthday; wore\r\nblack on the day of his abdication; fasted on the anniversary of King\r\nWilliam's coronation; and performed a thousand absurd antics, of which\r\nhe smiles now to think.\r\n\r\nThese follies caused many remonstrances on Tom Tusher's part, who\r\nwas always a friend to the powers that be, as Esmond was always in\r\nopposition to them. Tom was a Whig, while Esmond was a Tory. Tom never\r\nmissed a lecture, and capped the proctor with the profoundest of bows.\r\nNo wonder he sighed over Harry's insubordinate courses, and was angry\r\nwhen the others laughed at him. But that Harry was known to have my\r\nLord Viscount's protection, Tom no doubt would have broken with him\r\naltogether. But honest Tom never gave up a comrade as long as he was the\r\nfriend of a great man. This was not out of scheming on Tom's part, but\r\na natural inclination towards the great. 'Twas no hypocrisy in him\r\nto flatter, but the bent of his mind, which was always perfectly\r\ngood-humored, obliging, and servile.\r\n\r\nHarry had very liberal allowances, for his dear mistress of Castlewood\r\nnot only regularly supplied him, but the Dowager of Chelsey made her\r\ndonation annual, and received Esmond at her house near London every\r\nChristmas; but, in spite of these benefactions, Esmond was constantly\r\npoor; whilst 'twas a wonder with how small a stipend from his father Tom\r\nTusher contrived to make a good figure. 'Tis true that Harry both spent,\r\ngave, and lent his money very freely, which Thomas never did. I think he\r\nwas like the famous Duke of Marlborough in this instance, who, getting\r\na present of fifty pieces, when a young man, from some foolish woman\r\nwho fell in love with his good looks, showed the money to Cadogan in a\r\ndrawer scores of years after, where it had lain ever since he had sold\r\nhis beardless honor to procure it. I do not mean to say that Tom ever\r\nlet out his good looks so profitably, for nature had not endowed him\r\nwith any particular charms of person, and he ever was a pattern of moral\r\nbehavior, losing no opportunity of giving the very best advice to his\r\nyounger comrade; with which article, to do him justice, he parted very\r\nfreely. Not but that he was a merry fellow, too, in his way; he loved a\r\njoke, if by good fortune he understood it, and took his share generously\r\nof a bottle if another paid for it, and especially if there was a young\r\nlord in company to drink it. In these cases there was not a harder\r\ndrinker in the University than Mr. Tusher could be; and it was edifying\r\nto behold him, fresh shaved and with smug face, singing out \xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n at early chapel in the morning. In his reading, poor Harry permitted\r\nhimself to go a-gadding after all the Nine Muses, and so very likely had\r\nbut little favor from any one of them; whereas Tom Tusher, who had\r\nno more turn for poetry than a ploughboy, nevertheless, by a dogged\r\nperseverance and obsequiousness in courting the divine Calliope, got\r\nhimself a prize, and some credit in the University, and a fellowship\r\nat his college, as a reward for his scholarship. In this time of Mr.\r\nEsmond's life, he got the little reading which he ever could boast of,\r\nand passed a good part of his days greedily devouring all the books on\r\nwhich he could lay hand. In this desultory way the works of most of the\r\nEnglish, French, and Italian poets came under his eyes, and he had\r\na smattering of the Spanish tongue likewise, besides the ancient\r\nlanguages, of which, at least of Latin, he was a tolerable master.\r\n\r\nThen, about midway in his University career, he fell to reading for the\r\nprofession to which worldly prudence rather than inclination called him,\r\nand was perfectly bewildered in theological controversy. In the course\r\nof his reading (which was neither pursued with that seriousness or that\r\ndevout mind which such a study requires) the youth found himself at the\r\nend of one month a Papist, and was about to proclaim his faith; the next\r\nmonth a Protestant, with Chillingworth; and the third a sceptic, with\r\nHobbes and Bayle. Whereas honest Tom Tusher never permitted his mind to\r\nstray out of the prescribed University path, accepted the Thirty-nine\r\nArticles with all his heart, and would have signed and sworn to other\r\nnine-and-thirty with entire obedience. Harry's wilfulness in this\r\nmatter, and disorderly thoughts and conversation, so shocked and\r\nafflicted his senior, that there grew up a coldness and estrangement\r\nbetween them, so that they became scarce more than mere acquaintances,\r\nfrom having been intimate friends when they came to college first.\r\nPolitics ran high, too, at the University; and here, also, the young\r\nmen were at variance. Tom professed himself, albeit a high-churchman,\r\na strong King William's-man; whereas Harry brought his family Tory\r\npolitics to college with him, to which he must add a dangerous\r\nadmiration for Oliver Cromwell, whose side, or King James's by turns,\r\nhe often chose to take in the disputes which the young gentlemen used\r\nto hold in each other's rooms, where they debated on the state of the\r\nnation, crowned and deposed kings, and toasted past and present heroes\r\nand beauties in flagons of college ale.\r\n\r\nThus, either from the circumstances of his birth, or the natural\r\nmelancholy of his disposition, Esmond came to live very much by himself\r\nduring his stay at the University, having neither ambition enough to\r\ndistinguish himself in the college career, nor caring to mingle with\r\nthe mere pleasures and boyish frolics of the students, who were, for\r\nthe most part, two or three years younger than he. He fancied that the\r\ngentlemen of the common-room of his college slighted him on account of\r\nhis birth, and hence kept aloof from their society. It may be that\r\nhe made the ill will, which he imagined came from them, by his own\r\nbehavior, which, as he looks back on it in after life, he now sees\r\nwas morose and haughty. At any rate, he was as tenderly grateful for\r\nkindness as he was susceptible of slight and wrong; and, lonely as\r\nhe was generally, yet had one or two very warm friendships for his\r\ncompanions of those days.\r\n\r\nOne of these was a queer gentleman that resided in the University,\r\nthough he was no member of it, and was the professor of a science scarce\r\nrecognized in the common course of college education. This was a French\r\nrefugee-officer, who had been driven out of his native country at the\r\ntime of the Protestant persecutions there, and who came to Cambridge,\r\nwhere he taught the science of the small-sword, and set up a\r\nsaloon-of-arms. Though he declared himself a Protestant, 'twas said\r\nMr. Moreau was a Jesuit in disguise; indeed, he brought very strong\r\nrecommendations to the Tory party, which was pretty strong in that\r\nUniversity, and very likely was one of the many agents whom King James\r\nhad in this country. Esmond found this gentleman's conversation very\r\nmuch more agreeable and to his taste than the talk of the college\r\ndivines in the common-room; he never wearied of Moreau's stories of\r\nthe wars of Turenne and Conde, in which he had borne a part; and being\r\nfamiliar with the French tongue from his youth, and in a place where\r\nbut few spoke it, his company became very agreeable to the brave old\r\nprofessor of arms, whose favorite pupil he was, and who made Mr. Esmond\r\na very tolerable proficient in the noble science of escrime.\r\n\r\nAt the next term Esmond was to take his degree of Bachelor of Arts, and\r\nafterwards, in proper season, to assume the cassock and bands which his\r\nfond mistress would have him wear. Tom Tusher himself was a parson and\r\na fellow of his college by this time; and Harry felt that he would very\r\ngladly cede his right to the living of Castlewood to Tom, and that his\r\nown calling was in no way to the pulpit. But as he was bound, before\r\nall things in the world, to his dear mistress at home, and knew that a\r\nrefusal on his part would grieve her, he determined to give her no\r\nhint of his unwillingness to the clerical office: and it was in this\r\nunsatisfactory mood of mind that he went to spend the last vacation he\r\nshould have at Castlewood before he took orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nI COME HOME FOR A HOLIDAY TO CASTLEWOOD, AND FIND A SKELETON IN THE\r\nHOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt his third long vacation, Esmond came as usual to Castlewood, always\r\nfeeling an eager thrill of pleasure when he found himself once more\r\nin the house where he had passed so many years, and beheld the kind\r\nfamiliar eyes of his mistress looking upon him. She and her children\r\n(out of whose company she scarce ever saw him) came to greet him. Miss\r\nBeatrix was grown so tall that Harry did not quite know whether he\r\nmight kiss her or no; and she blushed and held back when he offered\r\nthat salutation, though she took it, and even courted it, when they were\r\nalone. The young lord was shooting up to be like his gallant father in\r\nlook, though with his mother's kind eyes: the lady of Castlewood herself\r\nseemed grown, too, since Harry saw her--in her look more stately, in\r\nher person fuller, in her face still as ever most tender and friendly, a\r\ngreater air of command and decision than had appeared in that guileless\r\nsweet countenance which Harry remembered so gratefully. The tone of her\r\nvoice was so much deeper and sadder when she spoke and welcomed him,\r\nthat it quite startled Esmond, who looked up at her surprised as she\r\nspoke, when she withdrew her eyes from him; nor did she ever look at him\r\nafterwards when his own eyes were gazing upon her. A something hinting\r\nat grief and secret, and filling his mind with alarm undefinable, seemed\r\nto speak with that low thrilling voice of hers, and look out of those\r\nclear sad eyes. Her greeting to Esmond was so cold that it almost pained\r\nthe lad, (who would have liked to fall on his knees, and kiss the skirt\r\nof her robe, so fond and ardent was his respect and regard for her,)\r\nand he faltered in answering the questions which she, hesitating on her\r\nside, began to put to him. Was he happy at Cambridge? Did he study too\r\nhard? She hoped not. He had grown very tall, and looked very well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has got a moustache!\xe2\x80\x9d cries out Master Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does he not wear a peruke like my Lord Mohun?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Beatrix.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord says that nobody wears their own hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you will have to occupy your old chamber,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhope the housekeeper has got it ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, mamma, you have been there ten times these three days yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaims Frank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she cut some flowers which you planted in my garden--do you\r\nremember, ever so many years ago? when I was quite a little girl,\xe2\x80\x9d cries\r\nout Miss Beatrix, on tiptoe. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd mamma put them in your window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember when you grew well after you were ill that you used to like\r\nroses,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, blushing like one of them. They all conducted\r\nHarry Esmond to his chamber; the children running before, Harry walking\r\nby his mistress hand-in-hand.\r\n\r\nThe old room had been ornamented and beautified not a little to receive\r\nhim. The flowers were in the window in a china vase; and there was a\r\nfine new counterpane on the bed, which chatterbox Beatrix said mamma had\r\nmade too. A fire was crackling on the hearth, although it was June. My\r\nlady thought the room wanted warming; everything was done to make him\r\nhappy and welcome: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are not to be a page any longer, but a\r\ngentleman and kinsman, and to walk with papa and mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nchildren. And as soon as his dear mistress and children had left him to\r\nhimself, it was with a heart overflowing with love and gratefulness that\r\nhe flung himself down on his knees by the side of the little bed, and\r\nasked a blessing upon those who were so kind to him.\r\n\r\nThe children, who are always house tell-tales, soon made him acquainted\r\nwith the little history of the house and family. Papa had been to London\r\ntwice. Papa often went away now. Papa had taken Beatrix to Westlands,\r\nwhere she was taller than Sir George Harper's second daughter, though\r\nshe was two years older. Papa had taken Beatrix and Frank both to\r\nBellminster, where Frank had got the better of Lord Bellminster's son in\r\na boxing-match--my lord, laughing, told Harry afterwards. Many gentlemen\r\ncame to stop with papa, and papa had gotten a new game from London,\r\na French game, called a billiard--that the French king played it very\r\nwell: and the Dowager Lady Castlewood had sent Miss Beatrix a present;\r\nand papa had gotten a new chaise, with two little horses, which he drove\r\nhimself, beside the coach, which mamma went in; and Dr. Tusher was a\r\ncross old plague, and they did not like to learn from him at all; and\r\npapa did not care about them learning, and laughed when they were at\r\ntheir books, but mamma liked them to learn, and taught them; and \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon't think papa is fond of mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Beatrix, with her great\r\neyes. She had come quite close up to Harry Esmond by the time this\r\nprattle took place, and was on his knee, and had examined all the points\r\nof his dress, and all the good or bad features of his homely face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn't say that papa is not fond of mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, at\r\nthis confession. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma never said so; and mamma forbade you to say it,\r\nMiss Beatrix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n'Twas this, no doubt, that accounted for the sadness in Lady\r\nCastlewood's eyes, and the plaintive vibrations of her voice. Who\r\ndoes not know of eyes, lighted by love once, where the flame shines no\r\nmore?--of lamps extinguished, once properly trimmed and tended? Every\r\nman has such in his house. Such mementoes make our splendidest chambers\r\nlook blank and sad; such faces seen in a day cast a gloom upon our\r\nsunshine. So oaths mutually sworn, and invocations of heaven, and\r\npriestly ceremonies, and fond belief, and love, so fond and faithful\r\nthat it never doubted but that it should live for ever, are all of no\r\navail towards making love eternal: it dies, in spite of the banns and\r\nthe priest; and I have often thought there should be a visitation of the\r\nsick for it, and a funeral service, and an extreme unction, and an\r\nabi in pace. It has its course, like all mortal things--its beginning,\r\nprogress, and decay. It buds and it blooms out into sunshine, and it\r\nwithers and ends. Strephon and Chloe languish apart; join in a rapture:\r\nand presently you hear that Chloe is crying, and Strephon has broken\r\nhis crook across her back. Can you mend it so as to show no marks of\r\nrupture? Not all the priests of Hymen, not all the incantations to the\r\ngods, can make it whole!\r\n\r\nWaking up from dreams, books, and visions of college honors, in which\r\nfor two years, Harry Esmond had been immersed, he found himself,\r\ninstantly, on his return home, in the midst of this actual tragedy of\r\nlife, which absorbed and interested him more than all his tutor had\r\ntaught him. The persons whom he loved best in the world, and to whom he\r\nowed most, were living unhappily together. The gentlest and kindest of\r\nwomen was suffering ill usage and shedding tears in secret: the man who\r\nmade her wretched by neglect, if not by violence, was Harry's benefactor\r\nand patron. In houses where, in place of that sacred, inmost flame\r\nof love, there is discord at the centre, the whole household becomes\r\nhypocritical, and each lies to his neighbor. The husband (or it may\r\nbe the wife) lies when the visitor comes in, and wears a grin of\r\nreconciliation or politeness before him. The wife lies (indeed, her\r\nbusiness is to do that, and to smile, however much she is beaten),\r\nswallows her tears, and lies to her lord and master; lies in bidding\r\nlittle Jackey respect dear papa; lies in assuring grandpapa that she\r\nis perfectly happy. The servants lie, wearing grave faces behind their\r\nmaster's chair, and pretending to be unconscious of the fighting;\r\nand so, from morning till bedtime, life is passed in falsehood. And\r\nwiseacres call this a proper regard of morals, and point out Baucis and\r\nPhilemon as examples of a good life.\r\n\r\nIf my lady did not speak of her griefs to Harry Esmond, my lord was\r\nby no means reserved when in his cups, and spoke his mind very freely,\r\nbidding Harry in his coarse way, and with his blunt language, beware\r\nof all women as cheats, jades, jilts, and using other unmistakable\r\nmonosyllables in speaking of them. Indeed, 'twas the fashion of the day,\r\nas I must own; and there's not a writer of my time of any note, with the\r\nexception of poor Dick Steele, that does not speak of a woman as of\r\na slave, and scorn and use her as such. Mr. Pope, Mr. Congreve, Mr.\r\nAddison, Mr. Gay, every one of 'em, sing in this key, each according to\r\nhis nature and politeness, and louder and fouler than all in abuse is\r\nDr. Swift, who spoke of them as he treated them, worst of all.\r\n\r\nMuch of the quarrels and hatred which arise between married people come\r\nin my mind from the husband's rage and revolt at discovering that\r\nhis slave and bedfellow, who is to minister to all his wishes, and is\r\nchurch-sworn to honor and obey him--is his superior; and that HE,\r\nand not she, ought to be the subordinate of the twain; and in these\r\ncontroversies, I think, lay the cause of my lord's anger against his\r\nlady. When he left her, she began to think for herself, and her thoughts\r\nwere not in his favor. After the illumination, when the love-lamp is\r\nput out that anon we spoke of, and by the common daylight we look at the\r\npicture, what a daub it looks! what a clumsy effigy! How many men and\r\nwives come to this knowledge, think you? And if it be painful to a woman\r\nto find herself mated for life to a boor, and ordered to love and honor\r\na dullard; it is worse still for the man himself perhaps, whenever in\r\nhis dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder\r\nis, in truth, his superior; that the woman who does his bidding, and\r\nsubmits to his humor, should be his lord; that she can think a thousand\r\nthings beyond the power of his muddled brains; and that in yonder head,\r\non the pillow opposite to him, lie a thousand feelings, mysteries of\r\nthought, latent scorns and rebellions, whereof he only dimly perceives\r\nthe existence as they look out furtively from her eyes: treasures of\r\nlove doomed to perish without a hand to gather them; sweet fancies and\r\nimages of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower;\r\nbright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the\r\nsun: and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these,\r\ndrives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness, and chafes\r\nwithout that his prisoner is rebellious, and his sworn subject undutiful\r\nand refractory. So the lamp was out in Castlewood Hall, and the lord\r\nand lady there saw each other as they were. With her illness and altered\r\nbeauty my lord's fire for his wife disappeared; with his selfishness and\r\nfaithlessness her foolish fiction of love and reverence was rent away.\r\nLove!--who is to love what is base and unlovely? Respect!--who is to\r\nrespect what is gross and sensual? Not all the marriage oaths sworn\r\nbefore all the parsons, cardinals, ministers, muftis, and rabbins in\r\nthe world, can bind to that monstrous allegiance. This couple was living\r\napart then; the woman happy to be allowed to love and tend her children\r\n(who were never of her own good-will away from her), and thankful to\r\nhave saved such treasures as these out of the wreck in which the better\r\npart of her heart went down.\r\n\r\nThese young ones had had no instructors save their mother, and Doctor\r\nTusher for their theology occasionally, and had made more progress than\r\nmight have been expected under a tutor so indulgent and fond as Lady\r\nCastlewood. Beatrix could sing and dance like a nymph. Her voice was\r\nher father's delight after dinner. She ruled over the house with little\r\nimperial ways, which her parents coaxed and laughed at. She had long\r\nlearned the value of her bright eyes, and tried experiments in coquetry,\r\nin corpore vili, upon rustics and country squires, until she should\r\nprepare to conquer the world and the fashion. She put on a new ribbon to\r\nwelcome Harry Esmond, made eyes at him, and directed her young smiles at\r\nhim, not a little to the amusement of the young man, and the joy of her\r\nfather, who laughed his great laugh, and encouraged her in her thousand\r\nantics. Lady Castlewood watched the child gravely and sadly: the\r\nlittle one was pert in her replies to her mother, yet eager in her\r\nprotestations of love and promises of amendment; and as ready to cry\r\n(after a little quarrel brought on by her own giddiness) until she\r\nhad won back her mamma's favor, as she was to risk the kind lady's\r\ndispleasure by fresh outbreaks of restless vanity. From her mother's sad\r\nlooks she fled to her father's chair and boozy laughter. She already\r\nset the one against the other: and the little rogue delighted in the\r\nmischief which she knew how to make so early.\r\n\r\nThe young heir of Castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both. He\r\ntook their caresses as men do, and as if they were his right. He had\r\nhis hawks and his spaniel dog, his little horse and his beagles. He had\r\nlearned to ride, and to drink, and to shoot flying: and he had a\r\nsmall court, the sons of the huntsman and woodman, as became the\r\nheir-apparent, taking after the example of my lord his father. If he had\r\na headache, his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in\r\nthe house: my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way--(indeed, 'twas\r\non the day after New Year's Day, and an excess of mince-pie)--and said\r\nwith some of his usual oaths--\xe2\x80\x9cD--n it, Harry Esmond--you see how my\r\nlady takes on about Frank's megrim. She used to be sorry about me, my\r\nboy (pass the tankard, Harry), and to be frightened if I had a headache\r\nonce. She don't care about my head now. They're like that--women\r\nare--all the same, Harry, all jilts in their hearts. Stick to\r\ncollege--stick to punch and buttery ale: and never see a woman that's\r\nhandsomer than an old cinder-faced bed-maker. That's my counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was my lord's custom to fling out many jokes of this nature, in\r\npresence of his wife and children, at meals--clumsy sarcasms which my\r\nlady turned many a time, or which, sometimes, she affected not to hear,\r\nor which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim\r\nwince (as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with\r\ntears), or which again worked her up to anger and retort, when,\r\nin answer to one of these heavy bolts, she would flash back with a\r\nquivering reply. The pair were not happy; nor indeed was it happy to be\r\nwith them. Alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness\r\nand bankruptcy! To see a young couple loving each other is no wonder;\r\nbut to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all.\r\nHarry Esmond became the confidant of one and the other--that is, my\r\nlord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs (which were indeed of Lord\r\nCastlewood's own making), and Harry divined my lady's; his affection\r\nleading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which Lady\r\nCastlewood generally chose to go disguised, and see her heart aching\r\nwhilst her face wore a smile. 'Tis a hard task for women in life, that\r\nmask which the world bids them wear. But there is no greater crime than\r\nfor a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so. The\r\nworld is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face; and\r\nour women, like the Malabar wives, are forced to go smiling and painted\r\nto sacrifice themselves with their husbands; their relations being the\r\nmost eager to push them on to their duty, and, under their shouts and\r\napplauses, to smother and hush their cries of pain.\r\n\r\nSo, into the sad secret of his patron's household, Harry Esmond became\r\ninitiated, he scarce knew how. It had passed under his eyes two years\r\nbefore, when he could not understand it; but reading, and thought, and\r\nexperience of men, had oldened him; and one of the deepest sorrows of a\r\nlife which had never, in truth, been very happy, came upon him now, when\r\nhe was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite\r\npowerless to relieve.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance, nor\r\nhis seat as a peer of the kingdom of Ireland, where, indeed, he had but\r\na nominal estate; and refused an English peerage which King William's\r\ngovernment offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty.\r\n\r\nHe might have accepted this, and would doubtless, but for the earnest\r\nremonstrances of his wife, who ruled her husband's opinions better than\r\nshe could govern his conduct, and who being a simple-hearted woman,\r\nwith but one rule of faith and right, never thought of swerving from her\r\nfidelity to the exiled family, or of recognizing any other sovereign but\r\nKing James; and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to\r\nthe reigning power, no temptation, she thought, could induce her to\r\nacknowledge the Prince of Orange as rightful monarch, nor to let her\r\nlord so acknowledge him. So my Lord Castlewood remained a nonjuror all\r\nhis life nearly, though his self-denial caused him many a pang, and left\r\nhim sulky and out of humor.\r\n\r\nThe year after the Revolution, and all through King William's life, 'tis\r\nknown there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled\r\nfamily; but if my Lord Castlewood took any share of these, as is\r\nprobable, 'twas only for a short time, and when Harry Esmond was too\r\nyoung to be introduced into such important secrets.\r\n\r\nBut in the year 1695, when that conspiracy of Sir John Fenwick, Colonel\r\nLowick, and others, was set on foot, for waylaying King William as he\r\ncame from Hampton Court to London, and a secret plot was formed, in\r\nwhich a vast number of the nobility and people of honor were engaged,\r\nFather Holt appeared at Castlewood, and brought a young friend with\r\nhim, a gentleman whom 'twas easy to see that both my lord and the Father\r\ntreated with uncommon deference. Harry Esmond saw this gentleman, and\r\nknew and recognized him in after life, as shall be shown in its place;\r\nand he has little doubt now that my Lord Viscount was implicated\r\nsomewhat in the transactions which always kept Father Holt employed\r\nand travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and\r\ndisguises. The Father's companion went by the name of Captain James;\r\nand it was under a very different name and appearance that Harry Esmond\r\nafterwards saw him.\r\n\r\nIt was the next year that the Fenwick conspiracy blew up, which is a\r\nmatter of public history now, and which ended in the execution of Sir\r\nJohn and many more, who suffered manfully for their treason, and who\r\nwere attended to Tyburn by my lady's father Dean Armstrong, Mr.\r\nCollier, and other stout nonjuring clergymen, who absolved them at the\r\ngallows-foot.\r\n\r\n'Tis known that when Sir John was apprehended, discovery was made of a\r\ngreat number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy; when, with\r\na noble wisdom and clemency, the Prince burned the list of conspirators\r\nfurnished to him, and said he would know no more. Now it was after this\r\nthat Lord Castlewood swore his great oath, that he would never, so\r\nhelp him heaven, be engaged in any transaction against that brave and\r\nmerciful man; and so he told Holt when the indefatigable priest visited\r\nhim, and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy. After this\r\nmy lord ever spoke of King William as he was--as one of the wisest, the\r\nbravest, and the greatest of men. My Lady Esmond (for her part) said she\r\ncould never pardon the King, first, for ousting his father-in-law\r\nfrom his throne, and secondly, for not being constant to his wife, the\r\nPrincess Mary. Indeed, I think if Nero were to rise again, and be king\r\nof England, and a good family man, the ladies would pardon him. My lord\r\nlaughed at his wife's objections--the standard of virtue did not fit him\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThe last conference which Mr. Holt had with his lordship took place when\r\nHarry was come home for his first vacation from college (Harry saw his\r\nold tutor but for a half-hour, and exchanged no private words with him),\r\nand their talk, whatever it might be, left my Lord Viscount very much\r\ndisturbed in mind--so much so, that his wife, and his young kinsman,\r\nHenry Esmond, could not but observe his disquiet. After Holt was\r\ngone, my lord rebuffed Esmond, and again treated him with the greatest\r\ndeference; he shunned his wife's questions and company, and looked at\r\nhis children with such a face of gloom and anxiety, muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nchildren--poor children!\xe2\x80\x9d in a way that could not but fill those whose\r\nlife it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm. For which gloom,\r\neach person interested in the Lord Castlewood, framed in his or her own\r\nmind an interpretation.\r\n\r\nMy lady, with a laugh of cruel bitterness said, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the person\r\nat Hexton has been ill, or has scolded him\xe2\x80\x9d (for my lord's infatuation\r\nabout Mrs. Marwood was known only too well). Young Esmond feared for his\r\nmoney affairs, into the condition of which he had been initiated; and\r\nthat the expenses, always greater than his revenue, had caused Lord\r\nCastlewood disquiet.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes why my Lord Viscount had taken young Esmond into his\r\nspecial favor was a trivial one, that hath not before been mentioned,\r\nthough it was a very lucky accident in Henry Esmond's life. A very few\r\nmonths after my lord's coming to Castlewood, in the winter time--the\r\nlittle boy, being a child in a petticoat, trotting about--it happened\r\nthat little Frank was with his father after dinner, who fell asleep over\r\nhis wine, heedless of the child, who crawled to the fire; and, as good\r\nfortune would have it, Esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just\r\nas the poor little screaming urchin's coat was set on fire by a log;\r\nwhen Esmond, rushing forward, tore the dress off the infant, so that his\r\nown hands were burned more than the child's, who was frightened rather\r\nthan hurt by this accident. But certainly 'twas providential that a\r\nresolute person should have come in at that instant, or the child had\r\nbeen burned to death probably, my lord sleeping very heavily after\r\ndrinking, and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to\r\nface.\r\n\r\nEver after this the father, loud in his expressions of remorse and\r\nhumility for being a tipsy good-for-nothing, and of admiration for Harry\r\nEsmond, whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling\r\nservice, had the tenderest regard for his son's preserver, and Harry\r\nbecame quite as one of the family. His burns were tended with the\r\ngreatest care by his kind mistress, who said that heaven had sent him\r\nto be the guardian of her children, and that she would love him all her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAnd it was after this, and from the very great love and tenderness which\r\nhad grown up in this little household, rather than from the exhortations\r\nof Dean Armstrong (though these had no small weight with him), that\r\nHarry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear\r\nmistress, of which he has ever since been a professing member. As for\r\nDr. Tusher's boasts that he was the cause of this conversion--even in\r\nthese young days Mr. Esmond had such a contempt for the Doctor, that had\r\nTusher bade him believe anything (which he did not--never meddling at\r\nall), Harry would that instant have questioned the truth on't.\r\n\r\nMy lady seldom drank wine; but on certain days of the year, such as\r\nbirthdays (poor Harry had never a one) and anniversaries, she took a\r\nlittle; and this day, the 29th December, was one. At the end, then, of\r\nthis year, '96, it might have been a fortnight after Mr. Holt's last\r\nvisit, Lord Castlewood being still very gloomy in mind, and sitting at\r\ntable--my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine, and looking\r\nat her husband with one of her sweet smiles, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, will you not fill a bumper too, and let me call a toast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, holding out his empty glass to be filled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis the 29th of December,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, with her fond look of\r\ngratitude: \xe2\x80\x9cand my toast is, 'Harry--and God bless him, who saved my\r\nboy's life!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord looked at Harry hard, and drank the glass, but clapped it down\r\non the table in a moment, and, with a sort of groan, rose up, and went\r\nout of the room. What was the matter? We all knew that some great grief\r\nwas over him.\r\n\r\nWhether my lord's prudence had made him richer, or legacies had fallen\r\nto him, which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that\r\nfrugal one which had been too much for his small means, Harry Esmond\r\nknew not; but the house of Castlewood was now on a scale much more\r\ncostly than it had been during the first years of his lordship's coming\r\nto the title. There were more horses in the stable and more servants in\r\nthe hall, and many more guests coming and going now than formerly, when\r\nit was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house\r\nas befitted one of his lordship's rank, and the estate out of debt. And\r\nit did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new\r\nacquaintances at Castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there: not\r\nthat she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy; but\r\nthey were persons who could not be welcome to her; and whose society a\r\nlady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children. There\r\ncame fuddling squires from the country round, who bawled their songs\r\nunder her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord's punch and\r\nale: there came officers from Hexton, in whose company our little lord\r\nwas made to hear talk and to drink, and swear too, in a way that made\r\nthe delicate lady tremble for her son. Esmond tried to console her by\r\nsaying what he knew of his College experience; that with this sort\r\nof company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his\r\ncourse through the world: and it mattered very little whether he heard\r\nit at twelve years old or twenty--the youths who quitted mother's\r\napron-strings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes. But it\r\nwas about her daughter that Lady Castlewood was the most anxious,\r\nand the danger which she thought menaced the little Beatrix from the\r\nindulgences which her father gave her, (it must be owned that my lord,\r\nsince these unhappy domestic differences especially, was at once violent\r\nin his language to the children when angry, as he was too familiar, not\r\nto say coarse, when he was in a good humor,) and from the company into\r\nwhich the careless lord brought the child.\r\n\r\nNot very far off from Castlewood is Sark Castle, where the Marchioness\r\nof Sark lived, who was known to have been a mistress of the late King\r\nCharles--and to this house, whither indeed a great part of the country\r\ngentry went, my lord insisted upon going, not only himself, but on\r\ntaking his little daughter and son, to play with the children there. The\r\nchildren were nothing loth, for the house was splendid, and the welcome\r\nkind enough. But my lady, justly no doubt, thought that the children of\r\nsuch a mother as that noted Lady Sark had been, could be no good company\r\nfor her two; and spoke her mind to her lord. His own language when he\r\nwas thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest: to be brief, there was a\r\nfamily dispute on this, as there had been on many other points--and the\r\nlady was not only forced to give in, for the other's will was law--nor\r\ncould she, on account of their tender age, tell her children what\r\nwas the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure, or indeed\r\nmention to them any objection at all--but she had the additional secret\r\nmortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends,\r\nloaded with presents from them, and eager to be allowed to go back to\r\na place of such delights as Sark Castle. Every year she thought the\r\ncompany there would be more dangerous to her daughter, as from a child\r\nBeatrix grew to a woman, and her daily increasing beauty, and many\r\nfaults of character too, expanded.\r\n\r\nIt was Harry Esmond's lot to see one of the visits which the old Lady of\r\nSark paid to the Lady of Castlewood Hall: whither she came in state with\r\nsix chestnut horses and blue ribbons, a page on each carriage step, a\r\ngentleman of the horse, and armed servants riding before and behind her.\r\nAnd, but that it was unpleasant to see Lady Castlewood's face, it was\r\namusing to watch the behavior of the two enemies: the frigid patience\r\nof the younger lady, and the unconquerable good-humor of the elder--who\r\nwould see no offence whatever her rival intended, and who never ceased\r\nto smile and to laugh, and to coax the children, and to pay compliments\r\nto every man, woman, child, nay dog, or chair and table, in Castlewood,\r\nso bent was she upon admiring everything there. She lauded the children,\r\nand wished as indeed she well might--that her own family had been\r\nbrought up as well as those cherubs. She had never seen such a\r\ncomplexion as dear Beatrix's--though to be sure she had a right to\r\nit from father and mother--Lady Castlewood's was indeed a wonder of\r\nfreshness, and Lady Sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair\r\nwoman; and remarking Harry Esmond, with a fascinating superannuated\r\nsmile, she complimented him on his wit, which she said she could see\r\nfrom his eyes and forehead; and vowed that she would never have HIM at\r\nSark until her daughter were out of the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMY LORD MOHUN COMES AMONG US FOR NO GOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had ridden along with this old Princess's cavalcade, two\r\ngentlemen: her son, my Lord Firebrace, and his friend, my Lord Mohun,\r\nwho both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable\r\nLord of Castlewood. My Lord Firebrace was but a feeble-minded\r\nand weak-limbed young nobleman, small in stature and limited in\r\nunderstanding to judge from the talk young Esmond had with him; but\r\nthe other was a person of a handsome presence, with the bel air, and a\r\nbright daring warlike aspect, which, according to the chronicle of those\r\ndays, had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and\r\ntoasts. He had fought and conquered in France, as well as in Flanders;\r\nhe had served a couple of campaigns with the Prince of Baden on the\r\nDanube, and witnessed the rescue of Vienna from the Turk. And he spoke\r\nof his military exploits pleasantly, and with the manly freedom of a\r\nsoldier, so as to delight all his hearers at Castlewood, who were little\r\naccustomed to meet a companion so agreeable.\r\n\r\nOn the first day this noble company came, my lord would not hear of\r\ntheir departure before dinner, and carried away the gentlemen to amuse\r\nthem, whilst his wife was left to do the honors of her house to the old\r\nMarchioness and her daughter within. They looked at the stables where my\r\nLord Mohun praised the horses, though there was but a poor show there:\r\nthey walked over the old house and gardens, and fought the siege of\r\nOliver's time over again: they played a game of rackets in the old\r\ncourt, where my Lord Castlewood beat my Lord Mohun, who said he loved\r\nball of all things, and would quickly come back to Castlewood for his\r\nrevenge. After dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green\r\nalley; and when they parted they were sworn friends, my Lord Castlewood\r\nkissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback, and pronouncing\r\nhim the best companion he had met for many a long day. All night long,\r\nover his tobacco-pipe, Castlewood did not cease to talk to Harry Esmond\r\nin praise of his new friend, and in fact did not leave off speaking of\r\nhim until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed; and when my lady\r\nsaid there was something free in the Lord Mohun's looks and manner of\r\nspeech which caused her to mistrust him, her lord burst out with one of\r\nhis laughs and oaths; said that he never liked man, woman, or beast,\r\nbut what she was sure to be jealous of it; that Mohun was the prettiest\r\nfellow in England; that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the\r\ncountry; and that he would let Mohun know what my Lady Prude said of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Castlewood said, \xe2\x80\x9cI liked his conversation well enough.\r\n'Tis more amusing than that of most people I know. I thought it, I own,\r\ntoo free; not from what he said, as rather from what he implied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPsha! your ladyship does not know the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou found no fault when I was a miss at fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegad, madam, you are grown too old for a pinafore now; and I hold\r\nthat 'tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord,\r\nslapping the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Francis, I never thought otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my lady, rising\r\nand dropping him a curtsy, in which stately action, if there was\r\nobedience, there was defiance too; and in which a bystander, deeply\r\ninterested in the happiness of that pair as Harry Esmond was, might see\r\nhow hopelessly separated they were; what a great gulf of difference and\r\ndiscord had run between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G-d! Mohun is the best fellow in England; and I'll invite him here,\r\njust to plague that woman. Did you ever see such a frigid insolence as\r\nit is, Harry? That's the way she treats me,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, storming, and\r\nhis face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm nobody\r\nin my own house. I'm to be the humble servant of that parson's daughter.\r\nBy Jove! I'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at\r\nme as she does. She puts me to shame before the children with her d--d\r\nairs; and, I'll swear, tells Frank and Beaty that papa's a reprobate,\r\nand that they ought to despise me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed and indeed, sir, I never heard her say a word but of respect\r\nregarding you,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry Esmond interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, curse it! I wish she would speak. But she never does. She\r\nscorns me, and holds her tongue. She keeps off from me, as if I was a\r\npestilence. By George! she was fond enough of her pestilence once. And\r\nwhen I came a-courting, you would see miss blush--blush red, by George!\r\nfor joy. Why, what do you think she said to me, Harry? She said herself,\r\nwhen I joked with her about her d--d smiling red cheeks: ''Tis as they\r\ndo at St. James's; I put up my red flag when my king comes.' I was the\r\nking, you see, she meant. But now, sir, look at her! I believe she would\r\nbe glad if I was dead; and dead I've been to her these five years--ever\r\nsince you all of you had the small-pox: and she never forgave me for\r\ngoing away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, my lord, though 'twas hard to forgive, I think my mistress\r\nforgave it,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry Esmond said; \xe2\x80\x9cand remember how eagerly she watched\r\nyour lordship's return, and how sadly she turned away when she saw your\r\ncold looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamme!\xe2\x80\x9d cries out my lord; \xe2\x80\x9cwould you have had me wait and catch the\r\nsmall-pox? Where the deuce had been the good of that? I'll bear danger\r\nwith any man--but not useless danger--no, no. Thank you for nothing.\r\nAnd--you nod your head, and I know very well, Parson Harry, what you\r\nmean. There was the--the other affair to make her angry. But is a woman\r\nnever to forgive a husband who goes a-tripping? Do you take me for a\r\nsaint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir, I do not,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince that time my wife's as cold as the statue at Charing Cross. I\r\ntell thee she has no forgiveness in her, Henry. Her coldness blights\r\nmy whole life, and sends me to the punch-bowl, or driving about the\r\ncountry. My children are not mine, but hers, when we are together. 'Tis\r\nonly when she is out of sight with her abominable cold glances, that\r\nrun through me, that they'll come to me, and that I dare to give them so\r\nmuch as a kiss; and that's why I take 'em and love 'em in other people's\r\nhouses, Harry. I'm killed by the very virtue of that proud woman.\r\nVirtue! give me the virtue that can forgive; give me the virtue that\r\nthinks not of preserving itself, but of making other folks happy.\r\nDamme, what matters a scar or two if 'tis got in helping a friend in ill\r\nfortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd my lord again slapped the table, and took a great draught from the\r\ntankard. Harry Esmond admired as he listened to him, and thought how the\r\npoor preacher of this self-sacrifice had fled from the small-pox, which\r\nthe lady had borne so cheerfully, and which had been the cause of so\r\nmuch disunion in the lives of all in this house. \xe2\x80\x9cHow well men preach,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cand each is the example in his own sermon. How\r\neach has a story in a dispute, and a true one, too, and both are right\r\nor wrong as you will!\xe2\x80\x9d Harry's heart was pained within him, to watch the\r\nstruggles and pangs that tore the breast of this kind, manly friend and\r\nprotector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to God that my mistress could hear you\r\nspeak as I have heard you; she would know much that would make her life\r\nthe happier, could she hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d But my lord flung away with one of his\r\noaths, and a jeer; he said that Parson Harry was a good fellow; but that\r\nas for women, all women were alike--all jades and heartless. So a man\r\ndashes a fine vase down, and despises it for being broken. It may be\r\nworthless--true: but who had the keeping of it, and who shattered it?\r\n\r\nHarry, who would have given his life to make his benefactress and her\r\nhusband happy, bethought him, now that he saw what my lord's state of\r\nmind was, and that he really had a great deal of that love left in his\r\nheart, and ready for his wife's acceptance if she would take it, whether\r\nhe could not be a means of reconciliation between these two persons,\r\nwhom he revered the most in the world. And he cast about how he should\r\nbreak a part of his mind to his mistress, and warn her that in his,\r\nHarry's opinion, at least, her husband was still her admirer, and even\r\nher lover.\r\n\r\nBut he found the subject a very difficult one to handle, when he\r\nventured to remonstrate, which he did in the very gravest tone, (for\r\nlong confidence and reiterated proofs of devotion and loyalty had given\r\nhim a sort of authority in the house, which he resumed as soon as ever\r\nhe returned to it,) and with a speech that should have some effect, as,\r\nindeed, it was uttered with the speaker's own heart, he ventured most\r\ngently to hint to his adored mistress that she was doing her husband\r\nharm by her ill opinion of him, and that the happiness of all the family\r\ndepended upon setting her right.\r\n\r\nShe, who was ordinarily calm and most gentle, and full of smiles and\r\nsoft attentions, flushed up when young Esmond so spoke to her, and rose\r\nfrom her chair, looking at him with a haughtiness and indignation that\r\nhe had never before known her to display. She was quite an altered being\r\nfor that moment; and looked an angry princess insulted by a vassal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever heard me utter a word in my lord's disparagement?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked hastily, hissing out her words, and stamping her foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond said, looking down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you come to me as his ambassador--YOU?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would sooner see peace between you than anything else in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Harry answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand would go of any embassy that had that end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo YOU are my lord's go-between?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, not regarding this\r\nspeech. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are sent to bid me back into slavery again, and inform me\r\nthat my lord's favor is graciously restored to his handmaid? He is weary\r\nof Covent Garden, is he, that he comes home and would have the fatted\r\ncalf killed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's good authority for it, surely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a son, yes; but my lord is not my son. It was he who cast me away\r\nfrom him. It was he who broke our happiness down, and he bids me to\r\nrepair it. It was he who showed himself to me at last, as he was, not\r\nas I had thought him. It is he who comes before my children stupid and\r\nsenseless with wine--who leaves our company for that of frequenters of\r\ntaverns and bagnios--who goes from his home to the City yonder and his\r\nfriends there, and when he is tired of them returns hither, and expects\r\nthat I shall kneel and welcome him. And he sends YOU as his chamberlain!\r\nWhat a proud embassy! Monsieur, I make you my compliment of the new\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a proud embassy, and a happy embassy too, could I bring you\r\nand my lord together,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume you have fulfilled your mission now, sir. 'Twas a pretty\r\none for you to undertake. I don't know whether 'tis your Cambridge\r\nphilosophy, or time, that has altered your ways of thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady\r\nCastlewood continued, still in a sarcastic tone. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you too have\r\nlearned to love drink, and to hiccup over your wine or punch;--which is\r\nyour worship's favorite liquor? Perhaps you too put up at the 'Rose'\r\non your way to London, and have your acquaintances in Covent Garden. My\r\nservices to you, sir, to principal and ambassador, to master and--and\r\nlackey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat heavens! madam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done that thus, for a\r\nsecond time, you insult me? Do you wish me to blush for what I used to\r\nbe proud of, that I lived on your bounty? Next to doing you a service\r\n(which my life would pay for), you know that to receive one from you is\r\nmy highest pleasure. What wrong have I done you that you should wound me\r\nso, cruel woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at Esmond with wild eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nnone--none that you know of, Harry, or could help. Why did you bring\r\nback the small-pox,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom Castlewood village?\r\nYou could not help it, could you? Which of us knows whither fate leads\r\nus? But we were all happy, Henry, till then.\xe2\x80\x9d And Harry went away from\r\nthis colloquy, thinking still that the estrangement between his patron\r\nand his beloved mistress was remediable, and that each had at heart a\r\nstrong attachment to the other.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy between the Lords Mohun and Castlewood appeared to increase\r\nas long as the former remained in the country; and my Lord of Castlewood\r\nespecially seemed never to be happy out of his new comrade's sight.\r\nThey sported together, they drank, they played bowls and tennis: my Lord\r\nCastlewood would go for three days to Sark, and bring back my Lord Mohun\r\nto Castlewood--where indeed his lordship made himself very welcome to\r\nall persons, having a joke or a new game at romps for the children, all\r\nthe talk of the town for my lord, and music and gallantry and plenty of\r\nthe beau langage for my lady, and for Harry Esmond, who was never tired\r\nof hearing his stories of his campaigns and his life at Vienna, Venice,\r\nParis, and the famous cities of Europe which he had visited both in\r\npeace and war. And he sang at my lady's harpsichord, and played cards\r\nor backgammon, or his new game of billiards with my lord (of whom he\r\ninvariably got the better) always having a consummate good-humor, and\r\nbearing himself with a certain manly grace, that might exhibit somewhat\r\nof the camp and Alsatia perhaps, but that had its charm, and stamped\r\nhim a gentleman: and his manner to Lady Castlewood was so devoted and\r\nrespectful, that she soon recovered from the first feelings of dislike\r\nwhich she had conceived against him--nay, before long, began to be\r\ninterested in his spiritual welfare, and hopeful of his conversion,\r\nlending him books of piety, which he promised dutifully to study. With\r\nher my lord talked of reform, of settling into quiet life, quitting the\r\ncourt and town, and buying some land in the neighborhood--though it\r\nmust be owned that, when the two lords were together over their Burgundy\r\nafter dinner, their talk was very different, and there was very little\r\nquestion of conversion on my Lord Mohun's part. When they got to their\r\nsecond bottle, Harry Esmond used commonly to leave these two noble\r\ntopers, who, though they talked freely enough, heaven knows, in his\r\npresence (Good Lord, what a set of stories, of Alsatia and Spring\r\nGarden, of the taverns and gaming-houses, of the ladies of the\r\ncourt, and mesdames of the theatres, he can recall out of their godly\r\nconversation!)--although, I say, they talked before Esmond freely, yet\r\nthey seemed pleased when he went away, and then they had another\r\nbottle, and then they fell to cards, and then my Lord Mohun came to her\r\nladyship's drawing-room; leaving his boon companion to sleep off his\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n'Twas a point of honor with the fine gentlemen of those days to lose\r\nor win magnificently at their horse-matches, or games of cards and\r\ndice--and you could never tell, from the demeanor of these two lords\r\nafterwards, which had been successful and which the loser at their\r\ngames. And when my lady hinted to my lord that he played more than she\r\nliked, he dismissed her with a \xe2\x80\x9cpish,\xe2\x80\x9d and swore that nothing was more\r\nequal than play betwixt gentlemen, if they did but keep it up long\r\nenough. And these kept it up long enough, you may be sure. A man of\r\nfashion of that time often passed a quarter of his day at cards, and\r\nanother quarter at drink: I have known many a pretty fellow, who was\r\na wit too, ready of repartee, and possessed of a thousand graces, who\r\nwould be puzzled if he had to write more than his name.\r\n\r\nThere is scarce any thoughtful man or woman, I suppose, but can look\r\nback upon his course of past life, and remember some point, trifling\r\nas it may have seemed at the time of occurrence, which has nevertheless\r\nturned and altered his whole career. 'Tis with almost all of us, as\r\nin M. Massillon's magnificent image regarding King William, a grain de\r\nsable that perverts or perhaps overthrows us; and so it was but a light\r\nword flung in the air, a mere freak of perverse child's temper, that\r\nbrought down a whole heap of crushing woes upon that family whereof\r\nHarry Esmond formed a part.\r\n\r\nComing home to his dear Castlewood in the third year of his academical\r\ncourse, (wherein he had now obtained some distinction, his Latin Poem\r\non the death of the Duke of Gloucester, Princess Anne of Denmark's son,\r\nhaving gained him a medal, and introduced him to the society of the\r\nUniversity wits,) Esmond found his little friend and pupil Beatrix grown\r\nto be taller than her mother, a slim and lovely young girl, with cheeks\r\nmantling with health and roses: with eyes like stars shining out\r\nof azure, with waving bronze hair clustered about the fairest young\r\nforehead ever seen: and a mien and shape haughty and beautiful, such\r\nas that of the famous antique statue of the huntress Diana--at one time\r\nhaughty, rapid, imperious, with eyes and arrows that dart and kill.\r\nHarry watched and wondered at this young creature, and likened her in\r\nhis mind to Artemis with the ringing bow and shafts flashing death upon\r\nthe children of Niobe; at another time she was coy and melting as\r\nLuna shining tenderly upon Endymion. This fair creature, this lustrous\r\nPhoebe, was only young as yet, nor had nearly reached her full splendor:\r\nbut crescent and brilliant, our young gentleman of the University, his\r\nhead full of poetical fancies, his heart perhaps throbbing with desires\r\nundefined, admired this rising young divinity; and gazed at her (though\r\nonly as at some \xe2\x80\x9cbright particular star,\xe2\x80\x9d far above his earth) with\r\nendless delight and wonder. She had been a coquette from the earliest\r\ntimes almost, trying her freaks and jealousies, her wayward frolics and\r\nwinning caresses, upon all that came within her reach; she set her women\r\nquarrelling in the nursery, and practised her eyes on the groom as she\r\nrode behind him on the pillion.\r\n\r\nShe was the darling and torment of father and mother. She intrigued with\r\neach secretly; and bestowed her fondness and withdrew it, plied them\r\nwith tears, smiles, kisses, cajolements;--when the mother was angry, as\r\nhappened often, flew to the father, and sheltering behind him, pursued\r\nher victim; when both were displeased, transferred her caresses to the\r\ndomestics, or watched until she could win back her parents' good graces,\r\neither by surprising them into laughter and good-humor, or appeasing\r\nthem by submission and artful humility. She was saevo laeta negotio,\r\nlike that fickle goddess Horace describes, and of whose \xe2\x80\x9cmalicious joy\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n a great poet of our own has written so nobly--who, famous and heroic as\r\nhe was, was not strong enough to resist the torture of women.\r\n\r\nIt was but three years before that the child, then but ten years old,\r\nhad nearly managed to make a quarrel between Harry Esmond and his\r\ncomrade, good-natured, phlegmatic Thomas Tusher, who never of his own\r\nseeking quarrelled with anybody: by quoting to the latter some silly\r\njoke which Harry had made regarding him--(it was the merest idlest jest,\r\nthough it near drove two old friends to blows, and I think such a battle\r\nwould have pleased her)--and from that day Tom kept at a distance from\r\nher; and she respected him, and coaxed him sedulously whenever they met.\r\nBut Harry was much more easily appeased, because he was fonder of the\r\nchild: and when she made mischief, used cutting speeches, or caused her\r\nfriends pain, she excused herself for her fault, not by admitting and\r\ndeploring it, but by pleading not guilty, and asserting innocence so\r\nconstantly, and with such seeming artlessness, that it was impossible to\r\nquestion her plea. In her childhood, they were but mischiefs then which\r\nshe did; but her power became more fatal as she grew older--as a kitten\r\nfirst plays with a ball, and then pounces on a bird and kills it. 'Tis\r\nnot to be imagined that Harry Esmond had all this experience at this\r\nearly stage of his life, whereof he is now writing the history--many\r\nthings here noted were but known to him in later days. Almost everything\r\nBeatrix did or undid seemed good, or at least pardonable, to him then,\r\nand years afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt happened, then, that Harry Esmond came home to Castlewood for his\r\nlast vacation, with good hopes of a fellowship at his college, and a\r\ncontented resolve to advance his fortune that way. 'Twas in the first\r\nyear of the present century, Mr. Esmond (as far as he knew the period of\r\nhis birth) being then twenty-two years old. He found his quondam pupil\r\nshot up into this beauty of which we have spoken, and promising yet\r\nmore: her brother, my lord's son, a handsome high-spirited brave lad,\r\ngenerous and frank, and kind to everybody, save perhaps his sister,\r\nwith whom Frank was at war (and not from his but her fault)--adoring his\r\nmother, whose joy he was: and taking her side in the unhappy matrimonial\r\ndifferences which were now permanent, while of course Mistress Beatrix\r\nranged with her father. When heads of families fall out, it must\r\nnaturally be that their dependants wear the one or the other party's\r\ncolor; and even in the parliaments in the servants' hall or the stables,\r\nHarry, who had an early observant turn, could see which were my lord's\r\nadherents and which my lady's, and conjecture pretty shrewdly how their\r\nunlucky quarrel was debated. Our lackeys sit in judgment on us. My\r\nlord's intrigues may be ever so stealthily conducted, but his valet\r\nknows them; and my lady's woman carries her mistress's private history\r\nto the servants' scandal market, and exchanges it against the secrets of\r\nother abigails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMY LORD LEAVES US AND HIS EVIL BEHIND HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mohun (of whose exploits and fame some of the gentlemen of the\r\nUniversity had brought down but ugly reports) was once more a guest at\r\nCastlewood, and seemingly more intimately allied with my lord even than\r\nbefore. Once in the spring those two noblemen had ridden to Cambridge\r\nfrom Newmarket, whither they had gone for the horse-racing, and had\r\nhonored Harry Esmond with a visit at his rooms; after which Doctor\r\nMontague, the master of the College, who had treated Harry somewhat\r\nhaughtily, seeing his familiarity with these great folks, and that my\r\nLord Castlewood laughed and walked with his hand on Harry's shoulder,\r\nrelented to Mr. Esmond, and condescended to be very civil to him; and\r\nsome days after his arrival, Harry, laughing, told this story to Lady\r\nEsmond, remarking how strange it was that men famous for learning and\r\nrenowned over Europe, should, nevertheless, so bow down to a title, and\r\ncringe to a nobleman ever so poor. At this Mistress Beatrix flung up her\r\nhead, and said it became those of low origin to respect their betters;\r\nthat the parsons made themselves a great deal too proud, she thought;\r\nand that she liked the way at Lady Sark's best, where the chaplain,\r\nthough he loved pudding, as all parsons do, always went away before the\r\ncustard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I am a parson,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you give me no custard,\r\nBeatrix?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--you are different,\xe2\x80\x9d Beatrix answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are of our blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was a parson, as you call him,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut mine is a peer of Ireland,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mistress Beatrix, tossing her\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cLet people know their places. I suppose you will have me go down\r\non my knees and ask a blessing of Mr. Thomas Tusher, that has just been\r\nmade a curate and whose mother was a waiting-maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she tossed out of the room, being in one of her flighty humors then.\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, my lady looked so sad and grave, that Harry asked\r\nthe cause of her disquietude. She said it was not merely what he said\r\nof Newmarket, but what she had remarked, with great anxiety and\r\nterror, that my lord, ever since his acquaintance with the Lord\r\nMohun especially, had recurred to his fondness for play, which he had\r\nrenounced since his marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut men promise more than they are able to perform in marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nmy lady, with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI fear he has lost large sums; and our property,\r\nalways small, is dwindling away under this reckless dissipation. I heard\r\nof him in London with very wild company. Since his return, letters\r\nand lawyers are constantly coming and going: he seems to me to have a\r\nconstant anxiety, though he hides it under boisterousness and laughter.\r\nI looked through--through the door last night, and--and before,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nmy lady, \xe2\x80\x9cand saw them at cards after midnight; no estate will bear that\r\nextravagance, much less ours, which will be so diminished that my son\r\nwill have nothing at all, and my poor Beatrix no portion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could help you, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry Esmond, sighing, and\r\nwishing that unavailingly, and for the thousandth time in his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can? Only God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Esmond--\xe2\x80\x9conly God, in whose hands we\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d And so it is, and for his rule over his family, and for\r\nhis conduct to wife and children--subjects over whom his power is\r\nmonarchical--any one who watches the world must think with trembling\r\nsometimes of the account which many a man will have to render. For in\r\nour society there's no law to control the King of the Fireside. He is\r\nmaster of property, happiness--life almost. He is free to punish,\r\nto make happy or unhappy--to ruin or to torture. He may kill a wife\r\ngradually, and be no more questioned than the Grand seignior who drowns\r\na slave at midnight. He may make slaves and hypocrites of his children;\r\nor friends and freemen; or drive them into revolt and enmity against the\r\nnatural law of love. I have heard politicians and coffee-house wiseacres\r\ntalking over the newspaper, and railing at the tyranny of the French\r\nKing, and the Emperor, and wondered how these (who are monarchs, too,\r\nin their way) govern their own dominions at home, where each man rules\r\nabsolute. When the annals of each little reign are shown to the Supreme\r\nMaster, under whom we hold sovereignty, histories will be laid bare of\r\nhousehold tyrants as cruel as Amurath, and as savage as Nero, and as\r\nreckless and dissolute as Charles.\r\n\r\nIf Harry Esmond's patron erred, 'twas in the latter way, from a\r\ndisposition rather self-indulgent than cruel; and he might have been\r\nbrought back to much better feelings, had time been given to him to\r\nbring his repentance to a lasting reform.\r\n\r\nAs my lord and his friend Lord Mohun were such close companions,\r\nMistress Beatrix chose to be jealous of the latter; and the two\r\ngentlemen often entertained each other by laughing, in their rude\r\nboisterous way, at the child's freaks of anger and show of dislike.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen thou art old enough, thou shalt marry Lord Mohun,\xe2\x80\x9d Beatrix's\r\nfather would say: on which the girl would pout and say, \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather\r\nmarry Tom Tusher.\xe2\x80\x9d And because the Lord Mohun always showed an extreme\r\ngallantry to my Lady Castlewood, whom he professed to admire devotedly,\r\none day, in answer to this old joke of her father's, Beatrix said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink my lord would rather marry mamma than marry me; and is waiting\r\ntill you die to ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were said lightly and pertly by the girl one night before\r\nsupper, as the family party were assembled near the great fire. The two\r\nlords, who were at cards, both gave a start; my lady turned as red as\r\nscarlet, and bade Mistress Beatrix go to her own chamber; whereupon the\r\ngirl, putting on, as her wont was, the most innocent air, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsure I meant no wrong; I am sure mamma talks a great deal more to Harry\r\nEsmond than she does to papa--and she cried when Harry went away, and\r\nshe never does when papa goes away! and last night she talked to Lord\r\nMohun for ever so long, and sent us out of the room, and cried when we\r\ncame back, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n!\xe2\x80\x9d cried out my Lord Castlewood, out of all patience. \xe2\x80\x9cGo out of\r\nthe room, you little viper!\xe2\x80\x9d and he started up and flung down his cards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Lord Mohun what I said to him, Francis,\xe2\x80\x9d her ladyship said, rising\r\nup with a scared face, but yet with a great and touching dignity and\r\ncandor in her look and voice. \xe2\x80\x9cCome away with me, Beatrix.\xe2\x80\x9d Beatrix\r\nsprung up too; she was in tears now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest mamma, what have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cSure I meant no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And she clung to her mother, and the pair went out sobbing together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what your wife said to me, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d my Lord Mohun cried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParson Harry may hear it; and, as I hope for heaven, every word I say\r\nis true. Last night, with tears in her eyes, your wife implored me to\r\nplay no more with you at dice or at cards, and you know best whether\r\nwhat she asked was not for your good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it was, Mohun,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord in a dry hard voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nyou are a model of a man: and the world knows what a saint you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mohun was separated from his wife, and had had many affairs of\r\nhonor: of which women as usual had been the cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no saint, though your wife is--and I can answer for my actions as\r\nother people must for their words,\xe2\x80\x9d said my Lord Mohun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G--, my lord, you shall,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, starting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have another little account to settle first, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lord\r\nMohun. Whereupon Harry Esmond, filled with alarm for the consequences\r\nto which this disastrous dispute might lead, broke out into the most\r\nvehement expostulations with his patron and his adversary. \xe2\x80\x9cGracious\r\nheavens!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy lord, are you going to draw a sword upon your\r\nfriend in your own house? Can you doubt the honor of a lady who is as\r\npure as heaven, and would die a thousand times rather than do you a\r\nwrong? Are the idle words of a jealous child to set friends at variance?\r\nHas not my mistress, as much as she dared do, besought your lordship, as\r\nthe truth must be told, to break your intimacy with my Lord Mohun; and\r\nto give up the habit which may bring ruin on your family? But for my\r\nLord Mohun's illness, had he not left you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Faith, Frank, a man with a gouty toe can't run after other men's\r\nwives,\xe2\x80\x9d broke out my Lord Mohun, who indeed was in that way, and with\r\na laugh and a look at his swathed limb so frank and comical, that the\r\nother dashing his fist across his forehead was caught by that infectious\r\ngood-humor, and said with his oath, \xe2\x80\x9c---- it, Harry, I believe thee,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and so this quarrel was over, and the two gentlemen, at swords drawn but\r\njust now, dropped their points, and shook hands.\r\n\r\nBeati pacifici. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, bring my lady back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry's patron. Esmond\r\nwent away only too glad to be the bearer of such good news. He found her\r\nat the door; she had been listening there, but went back as he came. She\r\ntook both his hands, hers were marble cold. She seemed as if she would\r\nfall on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, and God bless you, my dear brother\r\nHarry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She kissed his hand, Esmond felt her tears upon it:\r\nand leading her into the room, and up to my lord, the Lord Castlewood,\r\nwith an outbreak of feeling and affection such as he had not exhibited\r\nfor many a long day, took his wife to his heart, and bent over and\r\nkissed her and asked her pardon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis time for me to go to roost. I will have my gruel a-bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\nLord Mohun: and limped off comically on Harry Esmond's arm. \xe2\x80\x9cBy George,\r\nthat woman is a pearl!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand 'tis only a pig that wouldn't\r\nvalue her. Have you seen the vulgar traipsing orange-girl whom\r\nEsmond\xe2\x80\x9d--but here Mr. Esmond interrupted him, saying, that these were\r\nnot affairs for him to know.\r\n\r\nMy lord's gentleman came in to wait upon his master, who was no sooner\r\nin his nightcap and dressing-gown than he had another visitor whom his\r\nhost insisted on sending to him: and this was no other than the Lady\r\nCastlewood herself with the toast and gruel, which her husband bade her\r\nmake and carry with her own hands in to her guest.\r\n\r\nLord Castlewood stood looking after his wife as she went on this errand,\r\nand as he looked, Harry Esmond could not but gaze on him, and remarked\r\nin his patron's face an expression of love, and grief, and care, which\r\nvery much moved and touched the young man. Lord Castlewood's hands fell\r\ndown at his sides, and his head on his breast, and presently he said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard what Mohun said, parson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat my lady was a saint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat there are two accounts to settle. I have been going wrong these\r\nfive years, Harry Esmond. Ever since you brought that damned small-pox\r\ninto the house, there has been a fate pursuing me, and I had best have\r\ndied of it, and not run away from it like a coward. I left Beatrix with\r\nher relations, and went to London; and I fell among thieves, Harry, and\r\nI got back to confounded cards and dice, which I hadn't touched since\r\nmy marriage--no, not since I was in the Duke's Guard, with those wild\r\nMohocks. And I have been playing worse and worse, and going deeper and\r\ndeeper into it; and I owe Mohun two thousand pounds now; and when it's\r\npaid I am little better than a beggar. I don't like to look my boy in\r\nthe face; he hates me, I know he does. And I have spent Beaty's little\r\nportion: and the Lord knows what will come if I live; the best thing I\r\ncan do is to die, and release what portion of the estate is redeemable\r\nfor the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMohun was as much master at Castlewood as the owner of the Hall itself;\r\nand his equipages filled the stables, where, indeed, there was room\r\nand plenty for many more horses than Harry Esmond's impoverished patron\r\ncould afford to keep. He had arrived on horseback with his people; but\r\nwhen his gout broke out my Lord Mohun sent to London for a light chaise\r\nhe had, drawn by a pair of small horses, and running as swift, wherever\r\nroads were good, as a Laplander's sledge. When this carriage came, his\r\nlordship was eager to drive the Lady Castlewood abroad in it, and did so\r\nmany times, and at a rapid pace, greatly to his companion's enjoyment,\r\nwho loved the swift motion and the healthy breezes over the downs which\r\nlie hard upon Castlewood, and stretch thence towards the sea. As this\r\namusement was very pleasant to her, and her lord, far from showing\r\nany mistrust of her intimacy with Lord Mohun, encouraged her to be his\r\ncompanion--as if willing by his present extreme confidence to make up\r\nfor any past mistrust which his jealousy had shown--the Lady Castlewood\r\nenjoyed herself freely in this harmless diversion, which, it must be\r\nowned, her guest was very eager to give her; and it seemed that she grew\r\nthe more free with Lord Mohun, and pleased with his company, because of\r\nsome sacrifice which his gallantry was pleased to make in her favor.\r\n\r\nSeeing the two gentlemen constantly at cards still of evenings, Harry\r\nEsmond one day deplored to his mistress that this fatal infatuation\r\nof her lord should continue; and now they seemed reconciled together,\r\nbegged his lady to hint to her husband that he should play no more.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Castlewood, smiling archly and gayly, said she would speak to\r\nhim presently, and that, for a few nights more at least, he might be let\r\nto have his amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know not what it costs you; and 'tis\r\neasy for any observer who knows the game, to see that Lord Mohun is by\r\nfar the stronger of the two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he is,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, still with exceeding good-humor; \xe2\x80\x9che is\r\nnot only the best player, but the kindest player in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, madam!\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond cried, transported and provoked. \xe2\x80\x9cDebts of honor\r\nmust be paid some time or other; and my master will be ruined if he goes\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry, shall I tell you a secret?\xe2\x80\x9d my lady replied, with kindness and\r\npleasure still in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cFrancis will not be ruined if he goes on;\r\nhe will be rescued if he goes on. I repent of having spoken and thought\r\nunkindly of the Lord Mohun when he was here in the past year. He is full\r\nof much kindness and good; and 'tis my belief that we shall bring him\r\nto better things. I have lent him 'Tillotson' and your favorite\r\n'Bishop Taylor,' and he is much touched, he says; and as a proof of his\r\nrepentance--(and herein lies my secret)--what do you think he is doing\r\nwith Francis? He is letting poor Frank win his money back again. He hath\r\nwon already at the last four nights; and my Lord Mohun says that he will\r\nnot be the means of injuring poor Frank and my dear children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in God's name, what do you return him for the sacrifice?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nEsmond, aghast; who knew enough of men, and of this one in particular,\r\nto be aware that such a finished rake gave nothing for nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cHow, in\r\nheaven's name, are you to pay him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay him! With a mother's blessing and a wife's prayers!\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lady,\r\nclasping her hands together. Harry Esmond did not know whether to\r\nlaugh, to be angry, or to love his dear mistress more than ever for the\r\nobstinate innocency with which she chose to regard the conduct of a man\r\nof the world, whose designs he knew better how to interpret. He told the\r\nlady, guardedly, but so as to make his meaning quite clear to her, what\r\nhe knew in respect of the former life and conduct of this nobleman; of\r\nother women against whom he had plotted, and whom he had overcome;\r\nof the conversation which he, Harry himself, had had with Lord Mohun,\r\nwherein the lord made a boast of his libertinism, and frequently avowed\r\nthat he held all women to be fair game (as his lordship styled this\r\npretty sport), and that they were all, without exception, to be won. And\r\nthe return Harry had for his entreaties and remonstrances was a fit\r\nof anger on Lady Castlewood's part, who would not listen to his\r\naccusations; she said and retorted that he himself must be very wicked\r\nand perverted to suppose evil designs where she was sure none were\r\nmeant. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is the good meddlers get of interfering,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry thought\r\nto himself with much bitterness; and his perplexity and annoyance were\r\nonly the greater, because he could not speak to my Lord Castlewood\r\nhimself upon a subject of this nature, or venture to advise or warn him\r\nregarding a matter so very sacred as his own honor, of which my lord was\r\nnaturally the best guardian.\r\n\r\nBut though Lady Castlewood would listen to no advice from her young\r\ndependant, and appeared indignantly to refuse it when offered, Harry\r\nhad the satisfaction to find that she adopted the counsel which she\r\nprofessed to reject; for the next day she pleaded a headache, when my\r\nLord Mohun would have had her drive out, and the next day the headache\r\ncontinued; and next day, in a laughing gay way, she proposed that the\r\nchildren should take her place in his lordship's car, for they would\r\nbe charmed with a ride of all things; and she must not have all the\r\npleasure for herself. My lord gave them a drive with a very good grace,\r\nthough, I dare say, with rage and disappointment inwardly--not that his\r\nheart was very seriously engaged in his designs upon this simple lady:\r\nbut the life of such men is often one of intrigue, and they can no more\r\ngo through the day without a woman to pursue, than a fox-hunter without\r\nhis sport after breakfast.\r\n\r\nUnder an affected carelessness of demeanor, and though there was no\r\noutward demonstration of doubt upon his patron's part since the quarrel\r\nbetween the two lords, Harry yet saw that Lord Castlewood was watching\r\nhis guest very narrowly; and caught sight of distrust and smothered rage\r\n(as Harry thought) which foreboded no good. On the point of honor Esmond\r\nknew how touchy his patron was; and watched him almost as a physician\r\nwatches a patient, and it seemed to him that this one was slow to take\r\nthe disease, though he could not throw off the poison when once it had\r\nmingled with his blood. We read in Shakspeare (whom the writer for his\r\npart considers to be far beyond Mr. Congreve, Mr. Dryden, or any of the\r\nwits of the present period,) that when jealousy is once declared, nor\r\npoppy, nor mandragora, nor all the drowsy syrups of the East, will ever\r\nsoothe it or medicine it away.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the symptoms seemed to be so alarming to this young physician\r\n(who, indeed, young as he was, had felt the kind pulses of all those\r\ndear kinsmen), that Harry thought it would be his duty to warn my Lord\r\nMohun, and let him know that his designs were suspected and watched. So\r\none day, when in rather a pettish humor his lordship had sent to Lady\r\nCastlewood, who had promised to drive with him, and now refused to come,\r\nHarry said--\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, if you will kindly give me a place by your side\r\nI will thank you; I have much to say to you, and would like to speak to\r\nyou alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou honor me by giving me your confidence, Mr. Henry Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nother, with a very grand bow. My lord was always a fine gentleman, and\r\nyoung as he was there was that in Esmond's manner which showed that he\r\nwas a gentleman too, and that none might take a liberty with him--so the\r\npair went out, and mounted the little carriage, which was in waiting for\r\nthem in the court, with its two little cream-colored Hanoverian horses\r\ncovered with splendid furniture and champing at the bit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry Esmond, after they were got into the country, and\r\npointing to my Lord Mohun's foot, which was swathed in flannel, and put\r\nup rather ostentatiously on a cushion--\xe2\x80\x9cmy lord, I studied medicine at\r\nCambridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Parson Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cand are you going to take out a\r\ndiploma: and cure your fellow-students of the--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the gout,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, interrupting him, and looking him hard in the\r\nface; \xe2\x80\x9cI know a good deal about the gout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you may never have it. 'Tis an infernal disease,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand its twinges are diabolical. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d and he made a dreadful wry face,\r\nas if he just felt a twinge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour lordship would be much better if you took off all that flannel--it\r\nonly serves to inflame the toe,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry continued, looking his man full\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it only serves to inflame the toe, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, with\r\nan innocent air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you took off that flannel, and flung that absurd slipper away, and\r\nwore a boot,\xe2\x80\x9d continues Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou recommend me boots, Mr. Esmond?\xe2\x80\x9d asks my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, boots and spurs. I saw your lordship three days ago run down the\r\ngallery fast enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry goes on. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure that taking gruel at\r\nnight is not so pleasant as claret to your lordship; and besides it\r\nkeeps your lordship's head cool for play, whilst my patron's is hot and\r\nflustered with drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Sdeath, sir, you dare not say that I don't play fair?\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord,\r\nwhipping his horses, which went away at a gallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are cool when my lord is drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry continued; \xe2\x80\x9cyour lordship\r\ngets the better of my patron. I have watched you as I looked up from my\r\nbooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou young Argus!\xe2\x80\x9d says Lord Mohun, who liked Harry Esmond--and for\r\nwhose company and wit, and a certain daring manner, Harry had a great\r\nliking too--\xe2\x80\x9cYou young Argus! you may look with all your hundred eyes\r\nand see we play fair. I've played away an estate of a night, and I've\r\nplayed my shirt off my back; and I've played away my periwig and gone\r\nhome in a nightcap. But no man can say I ever took an advantage of him\r\nbeyond the advantage of the game. I played a dice-cogging scoundrel in\r\nAlsatia for his ears and won 'em, and have one of 'em in my lodging in\r\nBow Street in a bottle of spirits. Harry Mohun will play any man for\r\nanything--always would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are playing awful stakes, my lord, in my patron's house,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand more games than are on the cards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord, turning round, with a flush on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d answers Harry, in a sarcastic tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your gout is\r\nwell--if ever you had it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my lord, getting hot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to tell the truth I believe your lordship has no more gout than I\r\nhave. At any rate, change of air will do you good, my Lord Mohun. And I\r\nmean fairly that you had better go from Castlewood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd were you appointed to give me this message?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Lord Mohun.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Frank Esmond commission you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one did. 'Twas the honor of my family that commissioned me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are prepared to answer this?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the other, furiously\r\nlashing his horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite, my lord: your lordship will upset the carriage if you whip so\r\nhotly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George, you have a brave spirit!\xe2\x80\x9d my lord cried out, bursting into a\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose 'tis that infernal botte de Jesuite that makes you so\r\nbold,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis the peace of the family I love best in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry Esmond\r\nsaid warmly--\xe2\x80\x9c'tis the honor of a noble benefactor--the happiness of my\r\ndear mistress and her children. I owe them everything in life, my lord;\r\nand would lay it down for any one of them. What brings you here to\r\ndisturb this quiet household? What keeps you lingering month after month\r\nin the country? What makes you feign illness, and invent pretexts for\r\ndelay? Is it to win my poor patron's money? Be generous, my lord, and\r\nspare his weakness for the sake of his wife and children. Is it to\r\npractise upon the simple heart of a virtuous lady? You might as well\r\nstorm the Tower single-handed. But you may blemish her name by light\r\ncomments on it, or by lawless pursuits--and I don't deny that 'tis in\r\nyour power to make her unhappy. Spare these innocent people, and leave\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Lord, I believe thou hast an eye to the pretty Puritan thyself,\r\nMaster Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, with his reckless, good-humored laugh, and\r\nas if he had been listening with interest to the passionate appeal of\r\nthe young man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhisper, Harry. Art thou in love with her thyself? Hath\r\ntipsy Frank Esmond come by the way of all flesh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harry, his face flushing and his eyes filling\r\nas he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cI never had a mother, but I love this lady as one. I\r\nworship her as a devotee worships a saint. To hear her name spoken\r\nlightly seems blasphemy to me. Would you dare think of your own mother\r\nso, or suffer any one so to speak of her? It is a horror to me to fancy\r\nthat any man should think of her impurely. I implore you, I beseech you,\r\nto leave her. Danger will come out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDanger, psha!\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, giving a cut to the horses, which at this\r\nminute--for we were got on to the Downs--fairly ran off into a gallop\r\nthat no pulling could stop. The rein broke in Lord Mohun's hands, and\r\nthe furious beasts scampered madly forwards, the carriage swaying to\r\nand fro, and the persons within it holding on to the sides as best\r\nthey might, until seeing a great ravine before them, where an upset was\r\ninevitable, the two gentlemen leapt for their lives, each out of his\r\nside of the chaise. Harry Esmond was quit for a fall on the grass, which\r\nwas so severe that it stunned him for a minute; but he got up presently\r\nvery sick, and bleeding at the nose, but with no other hurt. The Lord\r\nMohun was not so fortunate; he fell on his head against a stone, and lay\r\non the ground, dead to all appearance.\r\n\r\nThis misadventure happened as the gentlemen were on their return\r\nhomewards; and my Lord Castlewood, with his son and daughter, who were\r\ngoing out for a ride, met the ponies as they were galloping with the car\r\nbehind, the broken traces entangling their heels, and my lord's people\r\nturned and stopped them. It was young Frank who spied out Lord Mohun's\r\nscarlet coat as he lay on the ground, and the party made up to that\r\nunfortunate gentleman and Esmond, who was now standing over him. His\r\nlarge periwig and feathered hat had fallen off, and he was bleeding\r\nprofusely from a wound on the forehead, and looking, and being, indeed,\r\na corpse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat God! he's dead!\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cRide, some one: fetch a\r\ndoctor--stay. I'll go home and bring back Tusher; he knows surgery,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nmy lord, with his son after him, galloped away.\r\n\r\nThey were scarce gone when Harry Esmond, who was indeed but just come to\r\nhimself, bethought him of a similar accident which he had seen on a ride\r\nfrom Newmarket to Cambridge, and taking off a sleeve of my lord's\r\ncoat, Harry, with a penknife, opened a vein of his arm, and was greatly\r\nrelieved, after a moment, to see the blood flow. He was near half an\r\nhour before he came to himself, by which time Doctor Tusher and little\r\nFrank arrived, and found my lord not a corpse indeed, but as pale as\r\none.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, when he was able to bear motion, they put my lord upon\r\na groom's horse, and gave the other to Esmond, the men walking on each\r\nside of my lord, to support him, if need were, and worthy Doctor Tusher\r\nwith them. Little Frank and Harry rode together at a foot pace.\r\n\r\nWhen we rode together home, the boy said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe met mamma, who was walking\r\non the terrace with the doctor, and papa frightened her, and told her\r\nyou were dead . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I was dead!\xe2\x80\x9d asks Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Papa says: 'Here's poor Harry killed, my dear;' on which mamma\r\ngives a great scream; and oh, Harry! she drops down; and I thought she\r\nwas dead too. And you never saw such a way as papa was in: he swore one\r\nof his great oaths: and he turned quite pale; and then he began to laugh\r\nsomehow, and he told the Doctor to take his horse, and me to follow him;\r\nand we left him. And I looked back, and saw him dashing water out of the\r\nfountain on to mamma. Oh, she was so frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMusing upon this curious history--for my Lord Mohun's name was Henry\r\ntoo, and they called each other Frank and Harry often--and not a little\r\ndisturbed and anxious, Esmond rode home. His dear lady was on the\r\nterrace still, one of her women with her, and my lord no longer there.\r\nThere are steps and a little door thence down into the road. My lord\r\npassed, looking very ghastly, with a handkerchief over his head, and\r\nwithout his hat and periwig, which a groom carried, but his politeness\r\ndid not desert him, and he made a bow to the lady above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank heaven, you are safe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so is Harry too, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d says little Frank,--\xe2\x80\x9chuzzay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond got off the horse to run to his mistress, as did little\r\nFrank, and one of the grooms took charge of the two beasts, while the\r\nother, hat and periwig in hand, walked by my lord's bridle to the front\r\ngate, which lay half a mile away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my boy! what a fright you have given me!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Castlewood said,\r\nwhen Harry Esmond came up, greeting him with one of her shining looks,\r\nand a voice of tender welcome; and she was so kind as to kiss the young\r\nman ['twas the second time she had so honored him), and she walked into\r\nthe house between him and her son, holding a hand of each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nWE RIDE AFTER HIM TO LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a repose of a couple of days, the Lord Mohun was so far recovered\r\nof his hurt as to be able to announce his departure for the next\r\nmorning; when, accordingly, he took leave of Castlewood, proposing to\r\nride to London by easy stages, and lie two nights upon the road. His\r\nhost treated him with a studied and ceremonious courtesy, certainly\r\ndifferent from my lord's usual frank and careless demeanor; but there\r\nwas no reason to suppose that the two lords parted otherwise than good\r\nfriends, though Harry Esmond remarked that my Lord Viscount only saw\r\nhis guest in company with other persons, and seemed to avoid being alone\r\nwith him. Nor did he ride any distance with Lord Mohun, as his custom\r\nwas with most of his friends, whom he was always eager to welcome and\r\nunwilling to lose; but contented himself, when his lordship's horses\r\nwere announced, and their owner appeared, booted for his journey, to\r\ntake a courteous leave of the ladies of Castlewood, by following the\r\nLord Mohun down stairs to his horses, and by bowing and wishing him\r\na good-day, in the court-yard. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you in London before very\r\nlong, Mohun,\xe2\x80\x9d my lord said, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we will settle our\r\naccounts together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not let them trouble you, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other good-naturedly, and\r\nholding out his hand, looked rather surprised at the grim and stately\r\nmanner in which his host received his parting salutation; and so,\r\nfollowed by his people, he rode away.\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond was witness of the departure. It was very different to my\r\nlord's coming, for which great preparation had been made (the old house\r\nputting on its best appearance to welcome its guest), and there was\r\na sadness and constraint about all persons that day, which filled Mr.\r\nEsmond with gloomy forebodings, and sad indefinite apprehensions. Lord\r\nCastlewood stood at the door watching his guest and his people as they\r\nwent out under the arch of the outer gate. When he was there, Lord Mohun\r\nturned once more, my Lord Viscount slowly raised his beaver and bowed.\r\nHis face wore a peculiar livid look, Harry thought. He cursed and kicked\r\naway his dogs, which came jumping about him--then he walked up to the\r\nfountain in the centre of the court, and leaned against a pillar and\r\nlooked into the basin. As Esmond crossed over to his own room, late the\r\nchaplain's, on the other side of the court, and turned to enter in at\r\nthe low door, he saw Lady Castlewood looking through the curtains of\r\nthe great window of the drawing-room overhead, at my lord as he stood\r\nregarding the fountain. There was in the court a peculiar silence\r\nsomehow; and the scene remained long in Esmond's memory:--the sky bright\r\noverhead; the buttresses of the building and the sun-dial casting shadow\r\nover the gilt memento mori inscribed underneath; the two dogs, a black\r\ngreyhound and a spaniel nearly white, the one with his face up to the\r\nsun, and the other snuffing amongst the grass and stones, and my lord\r\nleaning over the fountain, which was bubbling audibly. 'Tis strange how\r\nthat scene, and the sound of that fountain, remain fixed on the memory\r\nof a man who has beheld a hundred sights of splendor, and danger too, of\r\nwhich he has kept no account.\r\n\r\nIt was Lady Castlewood--she had been laughing all the morning, and\r\nespecially gay and lively before her husband and his guest--who as soon\r\nas the two gentlemen went together from her room, ran to Harry, the\r\nexpression of her countenance quite changed now, and with a face and\r\neyes full of care, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cFollow them, Harry, I am sure something\r\nhas gone wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d And so it was that Esmond was made an eavesdropper at\r\nthis lady's orders and retired to his own chamber, to give himself time\r\nin truth to try and compose a story which would soothe his mistress, for\r\nhe could not but have his own apprehension that some serious quarrel was\r\npending between the two gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAnd now for several days the little company at Castlewood sat at\r\ntable as of evenings: this care, though unnamed and invisible, being\r\nnevertheless present alway, in the minds of at least three persons\r\nthere. My lord was exceeding gentle and kind. Whenever he quitted the\r\nroom, his wife's eyes followed him. He behaved to her with a kind of\r\nmournful courtesy and kindness remarkable in one of his blunt ways and\r\nordinary rough manner. He called her by her Christian name often and\r\nfondly, was very soft and gentle with the children, especially with the\r\nboy, whom he did not love, and being lax about church generally, he went\r\nthither and performed all the offices (down even to listening to Dr.\r\nTusher's sermon) with great devotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe paces his room all night; what is it? Henry, find out what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Lady Castlewood said constantly to her young dependant. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has sent\r\nthree letters to London,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, another day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, madam, they were to a lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry answered, who knew of\r\nthese letters, and had seen a part of the correspondence, which related\r\nto a new loan my lord was raising; and when the young man remonstrated\r\nwith his patron, my lord said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was only raising money to pay off an\r\nold debt on the property, which must be discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRegarding the money, Lady Castlewood was not in the least anxious. Few\r\nfond women feel money-distressed; indeed you can hardly give a woman\r\na greater pleasure than to bid her pawn her diamonds for the man she\r\nloves; and I remember hearing Mr. Congreve say of my Lord Marlborough,\r\nthat the reason why my lord was so successful with women as a young man,\r\nwas because he took money of them. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are few men who will make such\r\na sacrifice for them,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Congreve, who knew a part of the sex\r\npretty well.\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond's vacation was just over, and, as hath been said, he was\r\npreparing to return to the University for his last term before taking\r\nhis degree and entering into the Church. He had made up his mind for\r\nthis office, not indeed with that reverence which becomes a man about to\r\nenter upon a duty so holy, but with a worldly spirit of acquiescence\r\nin the prudence of adopting that profession for his calling. But his\r\nreasoning was that he owed all to the family of Castlewood, and loved\r\nbetter to be near them than anywhere else in the world; that he might\r\nbe useful to his benefactors, who had the utmost confidence in him and\r\naffection for him in return; that he might aid in bringing up the young\r\nheir of the house and acting as his governor; that he might continue to\r\nbe his dear patron's and mistress's friend and adviser, who both were\r\npleased to say that they should ever look upon him as such; and so, by\r\nmaking himself useful to those he loved best, he proposed to console\r\nhimself for giving up of any schemes of ambition which he might have had\r\nin his own bosom. Indeed, his mistress had told him that she would not\r\nhave him leave her; and whatever she commanded was will to him.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Castlewood's mind was greatly relieved in the last few days of\r\nthis well-remembered holiday time, by my lord's announcing one morning,\r\nafter the post had brought him letters from London, in a careless tone,\r\nthat the Lord Mohun was gone to Paris, and was about to make a great\r\njourney in Europe; and though Lord Castlewood's own gloom did not wear\r\noff, or his behavior alter, yet this cause of anxiety being removed from\r\nhis lady's mind, she began to be more hopeful and easy in her spirits,\r\nstriving too, with all her heart, and by all the means of soothing in\r\nher power, to call back my lord's cheerfulness and dissipate his moody\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nHe accounted for it himself, by saying that he was out of health; that\r\nhe wanted to see his physician; that he would go to London, and consult\r\nDoctor Cheyne. It was agreed that his lordship and Harry Esmond should\r\nmake the journey as far as London together; and of a Monday morning, the\r\n11th of October, in the year 1700, they set forwards towards London on\r\nhorseback. The day before being Sunday, and the rain pouring down, the\r\nfamily did not visit church; and at night my lord read the service\r\nto his family very finely, and with a peculiar sweetness and\r\ngravity--speaking the parting benediction, Harry thought, as solemn\r\nas ever he heard it. And he kissed and embraced his wife and children\r\nbefore they went to their own chambers with more fondness than he was\r\nordinarily wont to show, and with a solemnity and feeling of which they\r\nthought in after days with no small comfort.\r\n\r\nThey took horse the next morning (after adieux from the family as tender\r\nas on the night previous), lay that night on the road, and entered\r\nLondon at nightfall; my lord going to the \xe2\x80\x9cTrumpet,\xe2\x80\x9d in the Cockpit,\r\nWhitehall, a house used by the military in his time as a young man, and\r\naccustomed by his lordship ever since.\r\n\r\nAn hour after my lord's arrival (which showed that his visit had been\r\narranged beforehand), my lord's man of business arrived from Gray's Inn;\r\nand thinking that his patron might wish to be private with the lawyer,\r\nEsmond was for leaving them: but my lord said his business was short;\r\nintroduced Mr. Esmond particularly to the lawyer, who had been engaged\r\nfor the family in the old lord's time; who said that he had paid the\r\nmoney, as desired that day, to my Lord Mohun himself, at his lodgings in\r\nBow Street; that his lordship had expressed some surprise, as it was not\r\ncustomary to employ lawyers, he said, in such transactions between men\r\nof honor; but nevertheless, he had returned my Lord Viscount's note of\r\nhand, which he held at his client's disposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought the Lord Mohun had been in Paris!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Esmond, in great\r\nalarm and astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is come back at my invitation,\xe2\x80\x9d said my Lord Viscount. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\naccounts to settle together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray heaven they are over, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, looking hard at the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was\r\nrather troublesome about that money which I told you I had lost to him\r\nat play. And now 'tis paid, and we are quits on that score, and we shall\r\nmeet good friends again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d cried out Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you are deceiving me, and that\r\nthere is a quarrel between the Lord Mohun and you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuarrel--pish! We shall sup together this very night, and drink a\r\nbottle. Every man is ill-humored who loses such a sum as I have lost.\r\nBut now 'tis paid, and my anger is gone with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall we sup, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWE! Let some gentlemen wait till they are asked,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Viscount\r\nwith a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go to Duke Street, and see Mr. Betterton. You love\r\nthe play, I know. Leave me to follow my own devices: and in the morning\r\nwe'll breakfast together, with what appetite we may, as the play says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G--! my lord, I will not leave you this night,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry Esmond.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know the cause of your dispute. I swear to you 'tis nothing.\r\nOn the very day the accident befell Lord Mohun, I was speaking to him\r\nabout it. I know that nothing has passed but idle gallantry on his\r\npart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that nothing has passed but idle gallantry between Lord Mohun\r\nand my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, in a thundering voice--\xe2\x80\x9cyou knew of this and\r\ndid not tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew more of it than my dear mistress did herself, sir--a thousand\r\ntimes more. How was she, who was as innocent as a child, to know what\r\nwas the meaning of the covert addresses of a villain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA villain he is, you allow, and would have taken my wife away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, she is as pure as an angel,\xe2\x80\x9d cried young Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I said a word against her?\xe2\x80\x9d shrieks out my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I ever doubt\r\nthat she was pure? It would have been the last day of her life when\r\nI did. Do you fancy I think that SHE would go astray? No, she hasn't\r\npassion enough for that. She neither sins nor forgives. I know her\r\ntemper--and now I've lost her, by heaven I love her ten thousand times\r\nmore than ever I did--yes, when she was as young and as beautiful as an\r\nangel--when she smiled at me in her old father's house, and used to lie\r\nin wait for me there as I came from hunting--when I used to fling my\r\nhead down on her little knees and cry like a child on her lap--and swear\r\nI would reform, and drink no more and play no more, and follow women no\r\nmore; when all the men of the Court used to be following her--when she\r\nused to look with her child more beautiful, by George, than the Madonna\r\nin the Queen's Chapel. I am not good like her, I know it. Who is--by\r\nheaven, who is? I tired and wearied her, I know that very well. I\r\ncould not talk to her. You men of wit and books could do that, and I\r\ncouldn't--I felt I couldn't. Why, when you was but a boy of fifteen I\r\ncould hear you two together talking your poetry and your books till I\r\nwas in such a rage that I was fit to strangle you. But you were always a\r\ngood lad, Harry, and I loved you, you know I did. And I felt she didn't\r\nbelong to me: and the children don't. And I besotted myself, and gambled\r\nand drank, and took to all sorts of deviltries out of despair and fury.\r\nAnd now comes this Mohun, and she likes him, I know she likes him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, and on my soul, you are wrong, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe takes letters from him,\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord--\xe2\x80\x9clook here, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\npulled out a paper with a brown stain of blood upon it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt fell from\r\nhim that day he wasn't killed. One of the grooms picked it up from the\r\nground and gave it me. Here it is in their d--d comedy jargon. 'Divine\r\nGloriana--Why look so coldly on your slave who adores you? Have you no\r\ncompassion on the tortures you have seen me suffering? Do you vouchsafe\r\nno reply to billets that are written with the blood of my heart.' She\r\nhad more letters from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she answered none,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's not Mohun's fault,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will be revenged on\r\nhim, as God's in heaven, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a light word or two, will you risk your lady's honor and your\r\nfamily's happiness, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond interposed beseechingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPsha--there shall be no question of my wife's honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\ncan quarrel on plenty of grounds beside. If I live, that villain will be\r\npunished; if I fall, my family will be only the better: there will only\r\nbe a spendthrift the less to keep in the world: and Frank has better\r\nteaching than his father. My mind is made up, Harry Esmond, and whatever\r\nthe event is, I am easy about it. I leave my wife and you as guardians\r\nto the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that my lord was bent upon pursuing this quarrel, and that no\r\nentreaties would draw him from it, Harry Esmond (then of a hotter and\r\nmore impetuous nature than now, when care, and reflection, and gray\r\nhairs have calmed him) thought it was his duty to stand by his kind,\r\ngenerous patron, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, if you are determined upon war, you\r\nmust not go into it alone. 'Tis the duty of our house to stand by its\r\nchief; and I should neither forgive myself nor you if you did not call\r\nme, or I should be absent from you at a moment of danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Harry, my poor boy, you are bred for a parson,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord,\r\ntaking Esmond by the hand very kindly; \xe2\x80\x9cand it were a great pity that\r\nyou should meddle in the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour lordship thought of being a churchman once,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyour father's orders did not prevent him fighting at Castlewood against\r\nthe Roundheads. Your enemies are mine, sir; I can use the foils, as you\r\nhave seen, indifferently well, and don't think I shall be afraid when\r\nthe buttons are taken off 'em.\xe2\x80\x9d And then Harry explained, with some\r\nblushes and hesitation (for the matter was delicate, and he feared lest,\r\nby having put himself forward in the quarrel, he might have offended\r\nhis patron), how he had himself expostulated with the Lord Mohun, and\r\nproposed to measure swords with him if need were, and he could not be\r\ngot to withdraw peaceably in this dispute. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should have beat him,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never could parry that botte I brought\r\nfrom Cambridge. Let us have half an hour of it, and rehearse--I can\r\nteach it your lordship: 'tis the most delicate point in the world, and\r\nif you miss it, your adversary's sword is through you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George, Harry, you ought to be the head of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord,\r\ngloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had been a better Lord Castlewood than a lazy sot like\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, drawing his hand across his eyes, and surveying his\r\nkinsman with very kind and affectionate glances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us take our coats off and have half an hour's practice before\r\nnightfall,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, after thankfully grasping his patron's manly\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are but a little bit of a lad,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, good-humoredly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut, in faith, I believe you could do for that fellow. No, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll have none of your feints and tricks of stabbing: I can\r\nuse my sword pretty well too, and will fight my own quarrel my own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall be by to see fair play?\xe2\x80\x9d cries Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, God bless you--you shall be by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is it, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, for he saw that the matter had been\r\narranged privately and beforehand by my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis arranged thus: I sent off a courier to Jack Westbury to say that I\r\nwanted him specially. He knows for what, and will be here presently, and\r\ndrink part of that bottle of sack. Then we shall go to the theatre in\r\nDuke Street, where we shall meet Mohun; and then we shall all go sup at\r\nthe 'Rose' or the 'Greyhound.' Then we shall call for cards, and\r\nthere will be probably a difference over the cards--and then, God help\r\nus!--either a wicked villain and traitor shall go out of the world, or\r\na poor worthless devil, that doesn't care to remain in it. I am better\r\naway, Hal--my wife will be all the happier when I am gone,\xe2\x80\x9d says my\r\nlord, with a groan, that tore the heart of Harry Esmond, so that he\r\nfairly broke into a sob over his patron's kind hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe business was talked over with Mohun before he left home--Castlewood\r\nI mean\xe2\x80\x9d--my lord went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI took the letter in to him, which I had\r\nread, and I charged him with his villainy, and he could make no denial\r\nof it, only he said that my wife was innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so she is; before heaven, my lord, she is!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, no doubt. They always are,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, when she\r\nheard he was killed, she fainted from accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my lord, MY name is Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d cried out Esmond, burning red. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ntold my lady, 'Harry was killed!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamnation! shall I fight you too?\xe2\x80\x9d shouts my lord in a fury. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you,\r\nyou little serpent, warmed by my fire, going to sting--YOU?--No, my boy,\r\nyou're an honest boy; you are a good boy.\xe2\x80\x9d (And here he broke from rage\r\ninto tears even more cruel to see.) \xe2\x80\x9cYou are an honest boy, and I love\r\nyou; and, by heavens, I am so wretched that I don't care what sword it\r\nis that ends me. Stop, here's Jack Westbury. Well, Jack! Welcome, old\r\nboy! This is my kinsman, Harry Esmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho brought your bowls for you at Castlewood, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, bowing;\r\nand the three gentlemen sat down and drank of that bottle of sack which\r\nwas prepared for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry is number three,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn't be afraid of him,\r\nJack.\xe2\x80\x9d And the Colonel gave a look, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, he don't\r\nlook as if I need.\xe2\x80\x9d And then my lord explained what he had only told by\r\nhints before. When he quarrelled with Lord Mohun he was indebted to his\r\nlordship in a sum of sixteen hundred pounds, for which Lord Mohun said\r\nhe proposed to wait until my Lord Viscount should pay him. My lord\r\nhad raised the sixteen hundred pounds and sent them to Lord Mohun that\r\nmorning, and before quitting home had put his affairs into order, and\r\nwas now quite ready to abide the issue of the quarrel.\r\n\r\nWhen we had drunk a couple of bottles of sack, a coach was called, and\r\nthe three gentlemen went to the Duke's Playhouse, as agreed. The play\r\nwas one of Mr. Wycherley's--\xe2\x80\x9cLove in a Wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond has thought of that play ever since with a kind of terror,\r\nand of Mrs. Bracegirdle, the actress who performed the girl's part in\r\nthe comedy. She was disguised as a page, and came and stood before the\r\ngentlemen as they sat on the stage, and looked over her shoulder with\r\na pair of arch black eyes, and laughed at my lord, and asked what ailed\r\nthe gentleman from the country, and had he had bad news from Bullock\r\nfair?\r\n\r\nBetween the acts of the play the gentlemen crossed over and conversed\r\nfreely. There were two of Lord Mohun's party, Captain Macartney, in a\r\nmilitary habit, and a gentleman in a suit of blue velvet and silver in a\r\nfair periwig, with a rich fall of point of Venice lace--my Lord the Earl\r\nof Warwick and Holland. My lord had a paper of oranges, which he ate and\r\noffered to the actresses, joking with them. And Mrs. Bracegirdle, when\r\nmy Lord Mohun said something rude, turned on him, and asked him what he\r\ndid there, and whether he and his friends had come to stab anybody else,\r\nas they did poor Will Mountford? My lord's dark face grew darker at this\r\ntaunt, and wore a mischievous, fatal look. They that saw it remembered\r\nit, and said so afterward.\r\n\r\nWhen the play was ended the two parties joined company; and my Lord\r\nCastlewood then proposed that they should go to a tavern and sup.\r\nLockit's, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreyhound,\xe2\x80\x9d in Charing Cross, was the house selected.\r\nAll six marched together that way; the three lords going a-head, Lord\r\nMohun's captain, and Colonel Westbury, and Harry Esmond, walking behind\r\nthem. As they walked, Westbury told Harry Esmond about his old friend\r\nDick the Scholar, who had got promotion, and was Cornet of the Guards,\r\nand had wrote a book called the \xe2\x80\x9cChristian Hero,\xe2\x80\x9d and had all the Guards\r\nto laugh at him for his pains, for the Christian Hero was breaking the\r\ncommandments constantly, Westbury said, and had fought one or two duels\r\nalready. And, in a lower tone, Westbury besought young Mr. Esmond to\r\ntake no part in the quarrel. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no need for more seconds than\r\none,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cand the Captain or Lord Warwick might easily\r\nwithdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d But Harry said no; he was bent on going through with the\r\nbusiness. Indeed, he had a plan in his head, which, he thought, might\r\nprevent my Lord Viscount from engaging.\r\n\r\nThey went in at the bar of the tavern, and desired a private room and\r\nwine and cards, and when the drawer had brought these, they began to\r\ndrink and call healths, and as long as the servants were in the room\r\nappeared very friendly.\r\n\r\nHarry Esmond's plan was no other than to engage in talk with Lord Mohun,\r\nto insult him, and so get the first of the quarrel. So when cards were\r\nproposed he offered to play. \xe2\x80\x9cPsha!\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Mohun (whether wishing\r\nto save Harry, or not choosing, to try the botte de Jesuite, it is\r\nnot to be known)--\xe2\x80\x9cYoung gentlemen from college should not play these\r\nstakes. You are too young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho dares say I am too young?\xe2\x80\x9d broke out Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your lordship\r\nafraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid!\xe2\x80\x9d cries out Mohun.\r\n\r\nBut my good Lord Viscount saw the move--\xe2\x80\x9cI'll play you for ten moidores,\r\nMohun,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou silly boy, we don't play for groats here as you\r\ndo at Cambridge.\xe2\x80\x9d And Harry, who had no such sum in his pocket (for his\r\nhalf-year's salary was always pretty well spent before it was due), fell\r\nback with rage and vexation in his heart that he had not money enough to\r\nstake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll stake the young gentleman a crown,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Lord Mohun's captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought crowns were rather scarce with the gentlemen of the army,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they birch at College?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey birch fools,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cand they cane bullies, and they fling\r\npuppies into the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, then, there's some escapes drowning,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain, who was\r\nan Irishman; and all the gentlemen began to laugh, and made poor Harry\r\nonly more angry.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mohun presently snuffed a candle. It was when the drawers\r\nbrought in fresh bottles and glasses and were in the room on which my\r\nLord Viscount said--\xe2\x80\x9cThe Deuce take you, Mohun, how damned awkward you\r\nare. Light the candle, you drawer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamned awkward is a damned awkward expression, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cTown gentlemen don't use such words--or ask pardon if they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm a country gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Viscount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it by your manner,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Mohun. \xe2\x80\x9cNo man shall say damned\r\nawkward to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fling the words in your face, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other; \xe2\x80\x9cshall I send\r\nthe cards too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, gentlemen! before the servants?\xe2\x80\x9d cry out Colonel Westbury\r\nand my Lord Warwick in a breath. The drawers go out of the room hastily.\r\nThey tell the people below of the quarrel up stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough has been said,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel Westbury. \xe2\x80\x9cWill your lordships meet\r\nto-morrow morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill my Lord Castlewood withdraw his words?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the Earl of Warwick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord Castlewood will be ---- first,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel Westbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we have nothing for it. Take notice, gentlemen, there have been\r\noutrageous words--reparation asked and refused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd refused,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Castlewood, putting on his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall\r\nthe meeting be? and when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince my Lord refuses me satisfaction, which I deeply regret, there is\r\nno time so good as now,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Mohun. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us have chairs and go\r\nto Leicester Field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre your lordship and I to have the honor of exchanging a pass or two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says Colonel Westbury, with a low bow to my Lord of Warwick and Holland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an honor for me,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, with a profound congee, \xe2\x80\x9cto be\r\nmatched with a gentleman who has been at Mons and Namur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your Reverence permit me to give you a lesson?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, gentlemen, two on a side are plenty,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry's patron.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare the boy, Captain Macartney,\xe2\x80\x9d and he shook Harry's hand--for the\r\nlast time, save one, in his life.\r\n\r\nAt the bar of the tavern all the gentlemen stopped, and my Lord Viscount\r\nsaid, laughing, to the barwoman, that those cards set people sadly\r\na-quarrelling; but that the dispute was over now, and the parties were\r\nall going away to my Lord Mohun's house, in Bow Street, to drink a\r\nbottle more before going to bed.\r\n\r\nA half-dozen of chairs were now called, and the six gentlemen stepping\r\ninto them, the word was privately given to the chairmen to go to\r\nLeicester Field, where the gentlemen were set down opposite the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStandard Tavern.\xe2\x80\x9d It was midnight, and the town was abed by this time,\r\nand only a few lights in the windows of the houses; but the night was\r\nbright enough for the unhappy purpose which the disputants came about;\r\nand so all six entered into that fatal square, the chairmen standing\r\nwithout the railing and keeping the gate, lest any persons should\r\ndisturb the meeting.\r\n\r\nAll that happened there hath been matter of public notoriety, and is\r\nrecorded, for warning to lawless men, in the annals of our country.\r\nAfter being engaged for not more than a couple of minutes, as Harry\r\nEsmond thought (though being occupied at the time with his own\r\nadversary's point, which was active, he may not have taken a good note\r\nof time), a cry from the chairmen without, who were smoking their pipes,\r\nand leaning over the railings of the field as they watched the dim\r\ncombat within, announced that some catastrophe had happened, which\r\ncaused Esmond to drop his sword and look round, at which moment his\r\nenemy wounded him in the right hand. But the young man did not heed\r\nthis hurt much, and ran up to the place where he saw his dear master was\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mohun was standing over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you much hurt, Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I am a dead man,\xe2\x80\x9d my lord said from the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not so,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other; \xe2\x80\x9cand I call God to witness, Frank\r\nEsmond, that I would have asked your pardon, had you but given me a\r\nchance. In--in the first cause of our falling out, I swear that no one\r\nwas to blame but me, and--and that my lady--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d says my poor Lord Viscount, lifting himself on his elbow and\r\nspeaking faintly. \xe2\x80\x9c'Twas a dispute about the cards--the cursed cards.\r\nHarry my boy, are you wounded, too? God help thee! I loved thee, Harry,\r\nand thou must watch over my little Frank--and--and carry this little\r\nheart to my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here my dear lord felt in his breast for a locket he wore there,\r\nand, in the act, fell back fainting.\r\n\r\nWe were all at this terrified, thinking him dead; but Esmond and Colonel\r\nWestbury bade the chairmen come into the field; and so my lord was\r\ncarried to one Mr. Aimes, a surgeon, in Long Acre, who kept a bath, and\r\nthere the house was wakened up, and the victim of this quarrel carried\r\nin.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Viscount was put to bed, and his wound looked to by the surgeon,\r\nwho seemed both kind and skilful. When he had looked to my lord, he\r\nbandaged up Harry Esmond's hand (who, from loss of blood, had fainted\r\ntoo, in the house, and may have been some time unconscious); and when\r\nthe young man came to himself, you may be sure he eagerly asked what\r\nnews there were of his dear patron; on which the surgeon carried him\r\nto the room where the Lord Castlewood lay; who had already sent for a\r\npriest; and desired earnestly, they said, to speak with his kinsman. He\r\nwas lying on a bed, very pale and ghastly, with that fixed, fatal look\r\nin his eyes, which betokens death; and faintly beckoning all the other\r\npersons away from him with his hand, and crying out \xe2\x80\x9cOnly Harry Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the hand fell powerless down on the coverlet, as Harry came forward, and\r\nknelt down and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art all but a priest, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d my Lord Viscount gasped out, with a\r\nfaint smile, and pressure of his cold hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they all gone? Let me\r\nmake thee a death-bed confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with sacred Death waiting, as it were, at the bed-foot, as an awful\r\nwitness of his words, the poor dying soul gasped out his last wishes\r\nin respect of his family;--his humble profession of contrition for his\r\nfaults;--and his charity towards the world he was leaving. Some things\r\nhe said concerned Harry Esmond as much as they astonished him. And\r\nmy Lord Viscount, sinking visibly, was in the midst of these strange\r\nconfessions, when the ecclesiastic for whom my lord had sent, Mr.\r\nAtterbury, arrived.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman had reached to no great church dignity as yet, but\r\nwas only preacher at St. Bride's, drawing all the town thither by his\r\neloquent sermons. He was godson to my lord, who had been pupil to his\r\nfather; had paid a visit to Castlewood from Oxford more than once; and\r\nit was by his advice, I think, that Harry Esmond was sent to Cambridge,\r\nrather than to Oxford, of which place Mr. Atterbury, though a\r\ndistinguished member, spoke but ill.\r\n\r\nOur messenger found the good priest already at his books at five o'clock\r\nin the morning, and he followed the man eagerly to the house where my\r\npoor Lord Viscount lay--Esmond watching him, and taking his dying words\r\nfrom his mouth.\r\n\r\nMy lord, hearing of Mr. Atterbury's arrival, and squeezing Esmond's\r\nhand, asked to be alone with the priest; and Esmond left them there for\r\nthis solemn interview. You may be sure that his own prayers and grief\r\naccompanied that dying benefactor. My lord had said to him that which\r\nconfounded the young man--informed him of a secret which greatly\r\nconcerned him. Indeed, after hearing it, he had had good cause for doubt\r\nand dismay; for mental anguish as well as resolution. While the colloquy\r\nbetween Mr. Atterbury and his dying penitent took place within, an\r\nimmense contest of perplexity was agitating Lord Castlewood's young\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour--it may be more--Mr. Atterbury came out of the\r\nroom, looking very hard at Esmond, and holding a paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is on the brink of God's awful judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d the priest whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nhas made his breast clean to me. He forgives and believes, and makes\r\nrestitution. Shall it be in public? Shall we call a witness to sign it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed out the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cmy dearest lord has only done me\r\nkindness all his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest put the paper into Esmond's hand. He looked at it. It swam\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis a confession,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Atterbury.\r\n\r\nThere was a fire in the room where the cloths were drying for the baths,\r\nand there lay a heap in a corner saturated with the blood of my dear\r\nlord's body. Esmond went to the fire, and threw the paper into it. 'Twas\r\na great chimney with glazed Dutch tiles. How we remember such trifles at\r\nsuch awful moments!--the scrap of the book that we have read in a great\r\ngrief--the taste of that last dish that we have eaten before a duel, or\r\nsome such supreme meeting or parting. On the Dutch tiles at the Bagnio\r\nwas a rude picture representing Jacob in hairy gloves, cheating Isaac of\r\nEsau's birthright. The burning paper lighted it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis only a confession, Mr. Atterbury,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. He leaned\r\nhis head against the mantel-piece: a burst of tears came to his eyes.\r\nThey were the first he had shed as he sat by his lord, scared by this\r\ncalamity, and more yet by what the poor dying gentleman had told him,\r\nand shocked to think that he should be the agent of bringing this double\r\nmisfortune on those he loved best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Esmond. And accordingly they went into the\r\nnext chamber, where by this time, the dawn had broke, which showed my\r\nlord's poor pale face and wild appealing eyes, that wore that awful\r\nfatal look of coming dissolution. The surgeon was with him. He went into\r\nthe chamber as Atterbury came out thence. My Lord Viscount turned round\r\nhis sick eyes towards Esmond. It choked the other to hear that rattle in\r\nhis throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord Viscount,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Atterbury, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Esmond wants no witnesses,\r\nand hath burned the paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest master!\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond said, kneeling down, and taking his hand and\r\nkissing it.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Viscount sprang up in his bed, and flung his arms round Esmond.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bl--bless--\xe2\x80\x9d was all he said. The blood rushed from his mouth,\r\ndeluging the young man. My dearest lord was no more. He was gone with a\r\nblessing on his lips, and love and repentance and kindness in his manly\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBenedicti benedicentes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Atterbury, and the young man,\r\nkneeling at the bedside, groaned out an \xe2\x80\x9cAmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho shall take the news to her?\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr. Esmond's next thought. And\r\non this he besought Mr. Atterbury to bear the tidings to Castlewood.\r\nHe could not face his mistress himself with those dreadful news. Mr.\r\nAtterbury complying kindly, Esmond writ a hasty note on his table-book\r\nto my lord's man, bidding him get the horses for Mr. Atterbury, and ride\r\nwith him, and send Esmond's own valise to the Gatehouse prison, whither\r\nhe resolved to go and give himself up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nCONTAINS MR. ESMOND'S MILITARY LIFE, AND OTHER MATTERS APPERTAINING TO\r\nTHE ESMOND FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nI AM IN PRISON, AND VISITED, BUT NOT CONSOLED THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose may imagine, who have seen death untimely strike down persons\r\nrevered and beloved, and know how unavailing consolation is, what was\r\nHarry Esmond's anguish after being an actor in that ghastly midnight\r\nscene of blood and homicide. He could not, he felt, have faced his dear\r\nmistress, and told her that story. He was thankful that kind Atterbury\r\nconsented to break the sad news to her; but, besides his grief, which\r\nhe took into prison with him, he had that in his heart which secretly\r\ncheered and consoled him.\r\n\r\nA great secret had been told to Esmond by his unhappy stricken kinsman,\r\nlying on his death-bed. Were he to disclose it, as in equity and honor\r\nhe might do, the discovery would but bring greater grief upon those whom\r\nhe loved best in the world, and who were sad enough already. Should he\r\nbring down shame and perplexity upon all those beings to whom he was\r\nattached by so many tender ties of affection and gratitude? degrade his\r\nfather's widow? impeach and sully his father's and kinsman's honor? and\r\nfor what? for a barren title, to be worn at the expense of an innocent\r\nboy, the son of his dearest benefactress. He had debated this matter in\r\nhis conscience, whilst his poor lord was making his dying confession. On\r\none side were ambition, temptation, justice even; but love, gratitude,\r\nand fidelity, pleaded on the other. And when the struggle was over in\r\nHarry's mind, a glow of righteous happiness filled it; and it was with\r\ngrateful tears in his eyes that he returned thanks to God for that\r\ndecision which he had been enabled to make.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was denied by my own blood,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cthese dearest friends\r\nreceived and cherished me. When I was a nameless orphan myself, and\r\nneeded a protector, I found one in yonder kind soul, who has gone to his\r\naccount repenting of the innocent wrong he has done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this consoling thought he went away to give himself up at the\r\nprison, after kissing the cold lips of his benefactor.\r\n\r\nIt was on the third day after he had come to the Gatehouse prison,\r\n(where he lay in no small pain from his wound, which inflamed and ached\r\nseverely,) and with those thoughts and resolutions that have been just\r\nspoke of, to depress, and yet to console him, that H. Esmond's keeper\r\ncame and told him that a visitor was asking for him, and though he could\r\nnot see her face, which was enveloped in a black hood, her whole figure,\r\ntoo, being veiled and covered with the deepest mourning, Esmond knew at\r\nonce that his visitor was his dear mistress.\r\n\r\nHe got up from his bed, where he was lying, being very weak; and\r\nadvancing towards her as the retiring keeper shut the door upon him and\r\nhis guest in that sad place, he put forward his left hand (for the right\r\nwas wounded and bandaged), and he would have taken that kind one of his\r\nmistress, which had done so many offices of friendship for him for so\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nBut the Lady Castlewood went back from him, putting back her hood, and\r\nleaning against the great stanchioned door which the gaoler had just\r\nclosed upon them. Her face was ghastly white, as Esmond saw it, looking\r\nfrom the hood; and her eyes, ordinarily so sweet and tender, were fixed\r\non him with such a tragic glance of woe and anger, as caused the young\r\nman, unaccustomed to unkindness from that person, to avert his own\r\nglances from her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this, Mr. Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis where I see you; and 'tis to this\r\nyou have brought me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have come to console me in my calamity, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he (though, in\r\ntruth, he scarce knew how to address her, his emotions at beholding her\r\nso overpowered him).\r\n\r\nShe advanced a little, but stood silent and trembling, looking out\r\nat him from her black draperies, with her small white hands clasped\r\ntogether, and quivering lips and hollow eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to reproach me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cMy grief is\r\nsufficient as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake back your hand--do not touch me with it!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cLook!\r\nthere's blood on it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish they had taken it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Esmond; \xe2\x80\x9cif you are unkind to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me back my husband, Henry.\r\nWhy did you stand by at midnight and see him murdered? Why did the\r\ntraitor escape who did it? You, the champion of your house, who offered\r\nto die for us! You that he loved and trusted, and to whom I confided\r\nhim--you that vowed devotion and gratitude, and I believed you--yes, I\r\nbelieved you--why are you here, and my noble Francis gone? Why did\r\nyou come among us? You have only brought us grief and sorrow; and\r\nrepentance, bitter, bitter repentance, as a return for our love and\r\nkindness. Did I ever do you a wrong, Henry? You were but an orphan child\r\nwhen I first saw you--when HE first saw you, who was so good, and noble,\r\nand trusting. He would have had you sent away, but, like a foolish\r\nwoman, I besought him to let you stay. And you pretended to love us, and\r\nwe believed you--and you made our house wretched, and my husband's heart\r\nwent from me: and I lost him through you--I lost him--the husband of my\r\nyouth, I say. I worshipped him: you know I worshipped him--and he was\r\nchanged to me. He was no more my Francis of old--my dear, dear soldier.\r\nHe loved me before he saw you; and I loved him. Oh, God is my witness\r\nhow I loved him! Why did he not send you from among us? 'Twas only\r\nhis kindness, that could refuse me nothing then. And, young as you\r\nwere--yes, and weak and alone--there was evil, I knew there was evil in\r\nkeeping you. I read it in your face and eyes. I saw that they boded harm\r\nto us--and it came, I knew it would. Why did you not die when you had\r\nthe small-pox--and I came myself and watched you, and you didn't know me\r\nin your delirium--and you called out for me, though I was there at your\r\nside? All that has happened since, was a just judgment on my wicked\r\nheart--my wicked jealous heart. Oh, I am punished--awfully punished!\r\nMy husband lies in his blood--murdered for defending me, my kind, kind,\r\ngenerous lord--and you were by, and you let him die, Henry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words, uttered in the wildness of her grief, by one who was\r\nordinarily quiet, and spoke seldom except with a gentle smile and a\r\nsoothing tone, rung in Esmond's ear; and 'tis said that he repeated many\r\nof them in the fever into which he now fell from his wound, and perhaps\r\nfrom the emotion which such passionate, undeserved upbraidings caused\r\nhim. It seemed as if his very sacrifices and love for this lady and her\r\nfamily were to turn to evil and reproach: as if his presence amongst\r\nthem was indeed a cause of grief, and the continuance of his life but\r\nwoe and bitterness to theirs. As the Lady Castlewood spoke bitterly,\r\nrapidly, without a tear, he never offered a word of appeal or\r\nremonstrance: but sat at the foot of his prison-bed, stricken only with\r\nthe more pain at thinking it was that soft and beloved hand which should\r\nstab him so cruelly, and powerless against her fatal sorrow. Her words\r\nas she spoke struck the chords of all his memory, and the whole of\r\nhis boyhood and youth passed within him; whilst this lady, so fond\r\nand gentle but yesterday--this good angel whom he had loved and\r\nworshipped--stood before him, pursuing him with keen words and aspect\r\nmalign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I were in my lord's place,\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not my fault\r\nthat I was not there, madam. But Fate is stronger than all of us, and\r\nwilled what has come to pass. It had been better for me to have died\r\nwhen I had the illness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said she--and as she spoke she looked at him with a glance\r\nthat was at once so fond and so sad, that the young man, tossing up his\r\narms, wildly fell back, hiding his head in the coverlet of the bed. As\r\nhe turned he struck against the wall with his wounded hand, displacing\r\nthe ligature; and he felt the blood rushing again from the wound. He\r\nremembered feeling a secret pleasure at the accident--and thinking,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I were to end now, who would grieve for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis hemorrhage, or the grief and despair in which the luckless young\r\nman was at the time of the accident, must have brought on a deliquium\r\npresently; for he had scarce any recollection afterwards, save of some\r\none, his mistress probably, seizing his hand--and then of the buzzing\r\nnoise in his ears as he awoke, with two or three persons of the prison\r\naround his bed, whereon he lay in a pool of blood from his arm.\r\n\r\nIt was now bandaged up again by the prison surgeon, who happened to be\r\nin the place; and the governor's wife and servant, kind people both,\r\nwere with the patient. Esmond saw his mistress still in the room when\r\nhe awoke from his trance; but she went away without a word; though\r\nthe governor's wife told him that she sat in her room for some time\r\nafterward, and did not leave the prison until she heard that Esmond was\r\nlikely to do well.\r\n\r\nDays afterwards, when Esmond was brought out of a fever which he had,\r\nand which attacked him that night pretty sharply, the honest keeper's\r\nwife brought her patient a handkerchief fresh washed and ironed, and at\r\nthe corner of which he recognized his mistress's well-known cipher\r\nand viscountess's crown. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lady had bound it round his arm when he\r\nfainted, and before she called for help,\xe2\x80\x9d the keeper's wife said. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nlady! she took on sadly about her husband. He has been buried to-day,\r\nand a many of the coaches of the nobility went with him--my Lord\r\nMarlborough's and my Lord Sunderland's, and many of the officers of the\r\nGuards, in which he served in the old King's time; and my lady has been\r\nwith her two children to the King at Kensington, and asked for justice\r\nagainst my Lord Mohun, who is in hiding, and my Lord the Earl of Warwick\r\nand Holland, who is ready to give himself up and take his trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the news, coupled with assertions about her own honesty and\r\nthat of Molly her maid, who would never have stolen a certain trumpery\r\ngold sleeve-button of Mr. Esmond's that was missing after his fainting\r\nfit, that the keeper's wife brought to her lodger. His thoughts followed\r\nto that untimely grave, the brave heart, the kind friend, the gallant\r\ngentleman, honest of word and generous of thought, (if feeble of\r\npurpose, but are his betters much stronger than he?) who had given him\r\nbread and shelter when he had none; home and love when he needed them;\r\nand who, if he had kept one vital secret from him, had done that\r\nof which he repented ere dying--a wrong indeed, but one followed by\r\nremorse, and occasioned by almost irresistible temptation.\r\n\r\nEsmond took his handkerchief when his nurse left him, and very likely\r\nkissed it, and looked at the bauble embroidered in the corner. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nhas cost thee grief enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cdear lady, so loving and so\r\ntender. Shall I take it from thee and thy children? No, never! Keep it,\r\nand wear it, my little Frank, my pretty boy. If I cannot make a name for\r\nmyself, I can die without one. Some day, when my dear mistress sees my\r\nheart, I shall be righted; or if not here or now, why, elsewhere; where\r\nHonor doth not follow us, but where Love reigns perpetual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n'Tis needless to relate here, as the reports of the lawyers already have\r\nchronicled them, the particulars or issue of that trial which ensued\r\nupon my Lord Castlewood's melancholy homicide. Of the two lords engaged\r\nin that sad matter, the second, my Lord the Earl of Warwick and Holland,\r\nwho had been engaged with Colonel Westbury, and wounded by him, was\r\nfound not guilty by his peers, before whom he was tried (under the\r\npresidence of the Lord Steward, Lord Somers); and the principal, the\r\nLord Mohun, being found guilty of the manslaughter, (which, indeed, was\r\nforced upon him, and of which he repented most sincerely,) pleaded his\r\nclergy, and so was discharged without any penalty. The widow of the\r\nslain nobleman, as it was told us in prison, showed an extraordinary\r\nspirit; and, though she had to wait for ten years before her son was old\r\nenough to compass it, declared she would have revenge of her husband's\r\nmurderer. So much and suddenly had grief, anger, and misfortune appeared\r\nto change her. But fortune, good or ill, as I take it, does not change\r\nmen and women. It but develops their characters. As there are a thousand\r\nthoughts lying within a man that he does not know till he takes up the\r\npen to write, so the heart is a secret even to him (or her) who has it\r\nin his own breast. Who hath not found himself surprised into revenge, or\r\naction, or passion, for good or evil, whereof the seeds lay within him,\r\nlatent and unsuspected, until the occasion called them forth? With the\r\ndeath of her lord, a change seemed to come over the whole conduct and\r\nmind of Lady Castlewood; but of this we shall speak in the right season\r\nand anon.\r\n\r\nThe lords being tried then before their peers at Westminster, according\r\nto their privilege, being brought from the Tower with state processions\r\nand barges, and accompanied by lieutenants and axe-men, the commoners\r\nengaged in that melancholy fray took their trial at Newgate, as became\r\nthem; and, being all found guilty, pleaded likewise their benefit\r\nof clergy. The sentence, as we all know in these cases, is, that the\r\nculprit lies a year in prison, or during the King's pleasure, and is\r\nburned in the hand, or only stamped with a cold iron; or this part of\r\nthe punishment is altogether remitted at the grace of the Sovereign. So\r\nHarry Esmond found himself a criminal and a prisoner at two-and-twenty\r\nyears old; as for the two colonels, his comrades, they took the matter\r\nvery lightly. Duelling was a part of their business; and they could not\r\nin honor refuse any invitations of that sort.\r\n\r\nBut the case was different with Mr. Esmond. His life was changed by\r\nthat stroke of the sword which destroyed his kind patron's. As he lay in\r\nprison, old Dr. Tusher fell ill and died; and Lady Castlewood appointed\r\nThomas Tusher to the vacant living; about the filling of which she had\r\na thousand times fondly talked to Harry Esmond: how they never should\r\npart; how he should educate her boy; how to be a country clergyman, like\r\nsaintly George Herbert or pious Dr. Ken, was the happiest and greatest\r\nlot in life; how (if he were obstinately bent on it, though, for her\r\npart, she owned rather to holding Queen Bess's opinion, that a bishop\r\nshould have no wife, and if not a bishop why a clergyman?) she would\r\nfind a good wife for Harry Esmond: and so on, with a hundred pretty\r\nprospects told by fireside evenings, in fond prattle, as the children\r\nplayed about the hall. All these plans were overthrown now. Thomas\r\nTusher wrote to Esmond, as he lay in prison, announcing that his\r\npatroness had conferred upon him the living his reverend father had\r\nheld for many years; that she never, after the tragical events which had\r\noccurred (whereof Tom spoke with a very edifying horror), could see\r\nin the revered Tusher's pulpit, or at her son's table, the man who was\r\nanswerable for the father's life; that her ladyship bade him to say that\r\nshe prayed for her kinsman's repentance and his worldly happiness; that\r\nhe was free to command her aid for any scheme of life which he might\r\npropose to himself; but that on this side of the grave she would see him\r\nno more. And Tusher, for his own part, added that Harry should have his\r\nprayers as a friend of his youth, and commended him whilst he was in\r\nprison to read certain works of theology, which his Reverence pronounced\r\nto be very wholesome for sinners in his lamentable condition.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the return for a life of devotion--this the end of years of\r\naffectionate intercourse and passionate fidelity! Harry would have died\r\nfor his patron, and was held as little better than his murderer: he had\r\nsacrificed, she did not know how much, for his mistress, and she threw\r\nhim aside; he had endowed her family with all they had, and she talked\r\nabout giving him alms as to a menial! The grief for his patron's loss;\r\nthe pains of his own present position, and doubts as to the future: all\r\nthese were forgotten under the sense of the consummate outrage which he\r\nhad to endure, and overpowered by the superior pang of that torture.\r\n\r\nHe writ back a letter to Mr. Tusher from his prison, congratulating\r\nhis Reverence upon his appointment to the living of Castlewood:\r\nsarcastically bidding him to follow in the footsteps of his admirable\r\nfather, whose gown had descended upon him; thanking her ladyship for her\r\noffer of alms, which he said he should trust not to need; and beseeching\r\nher to remember that, if ever her determination should change towards\r\nhim, he would be ready to give her proofs of a fidelity which had never\r\nwavered, and which ought never to have been questioned by that house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if we meet no more, or only as strangers in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Esmond\r\nconcluded, \xe2\x80\x9ca sentence against the cruelty and injustice of which I\r\ndisdain to appeal; hereafter she will know who was faithful to her,\r\nand whether she had any cause to suspect the love and devotion of her\r\nkinsman and servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter the sending of this letter, the poor young fellow's mind was more\r\nat ease than it had been previously. The blow had been struck, and he\r\nhad borne it. His cruel goddess had shaken her wings and fled: and left\r\nhim alone and friendless, but virtute sua. And he had to bear him up, at\r\nonce the sense of his right and the feeling of his wrongs, his honor\r\nand his misfortune. As I have seen men waking and running to arms at a\r\nsudden trumpet, before emergency a manly heart leaps up resolute;\r\nmeets the threatening danger with undaunted countenance; and, whether\r\nconquered or conquering, faces it always. Ah! no man knows his strength\r\nor his weakness, till occasion proves them. If there be some thoughts\r\nand actions of his life from the memory of which a man shrinks with\r\nshame, sure there are some which he may be proud to own and remember;\r\nforgiven injuries, conquered temptations (now and then) and difficulties\r\nvanquished by endurance.\r\n\r\nIt was these thoughts regarding the living, far more than any great\r\npoignancy of grief respecting the dead, which affected Harry Esmond\r\nwhilst in prison after his trial: but it may be imagined that he could\r\ntake no comrade of misfortune into the confidence of his feelings,\r\nand they thought it was remorse and sorrow for his patron's loss which\r\naffected the young man, in error of which opinion he chose to leave\r\nthem. As a companion he was so moody and silent that the two officers,\r\nhis fellow-sufferers, left him to himself mostly, liked little very\r\nlikely what they knew of him, consoled themselves with dice, cards, and\r\nthe bottle, and whiled away their own captivity in their own way. It\r\nseemed to Esmond as if he lived years in that prison: and was changed\r\nand aged when he came out of it. At certain periods of life we live\r\nyears of emotion in a few weeks--and look back on those times, as on\r\ngreat gaps between the old life and the new. You do not know how much\r\nyou suffer in those critical maladies of the heart, until the disease is\r\nover and you look back on it afterwards. During the time, the suffering\r\nis at least sufferable. The day passes in more or less of pain, and the\r\nnight wears away somehow. 'Tis only in after days that we see what the\r\ndanger has been--as a man out a-hunting or riding for his life looks at\r\na leap, and wonders how he should have survived the taking of it. O dark\r\nmonths of grief and rage! of wrong and cruel endurance! He is old now\r\nwho recalls you. Long ago he has forgiven and blest the soft hand that\r\nwounded him: but the mark is there, and the wound is cicatrized only--no\r\ntime, tears, caresses, or repentance, can obliterate the scar. We are\r\nindocile to put up with grief, however. Reficimus rates quassas: we\r\ntempt the ocean again and again, and try upon new ventures. Esmond\r\nthought of his early time as a novitiate, and of this past trial as\r\nan initiation before entering into life--as our young Indians undergo\r\ntortures silently before they pass to the rank of warriors in the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe officers, meanwhile, who were not let into the secret of the grief\r\nwhich was gnawing at the side of their silent young friend, and being\r\naccustomed to such transactions, in which one comrade or another was\r\ndaily paying the forfeit of the sword, did not, of course, bemoan\r\nthemselves very inconsolably about the fate of their late companion in\r\narms. This one told stories of former adventures of love, or war,\r\nor pleasure, in which poor Frank Esmond had been engaged; t'other\r\nrecollected how a constable had been bilked, or a tavern-bully beaten:\r\nwhilst my lord's poor widow was sitting at his tomb worshipping him as\r\nan actual saint and spotless hero--so the visitors said who had news of\r\nLady Castlewood; and Westbury and Macartney had pretty nearly had all\r\nthe town to come and see them.\r\n\r\nThe duel, its fatal termination, the trial of the two peers and the\r\nthree commoners concerned, had caused the greatest excitement in the\r\ntown. The prints and News Letters were full of them. The three gentlemen\r\nin Newgate were almost as much crowded as the bishops in the Tower, or\r\na highwayman before execution. We were allowed to live in the Governor's\r\nhouse, as hath been said, both before trial and after condemnation,\r\nwaiting the King's pleasure; nor was the real cause of the fatal quarrel\r\nknown, so closely had my lord and the two other persons who knew it kept\r\nthe secret, but every one imagined that the origin of the meeting was\r\na gambling dispute. Except fresh air, the prisoners had, upon payment,\r\nmost things they could desire. Interest was made that they should not\r\nmix with the vulgar convicts, whose ribald choruses and loud laughter\r\nand curses could be heard from their own part of the prison, where they\r\nand the miserable debtors were confined pell-mell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nI COME TO THE END OF MY CAPTIVITY, BUT NOT OF MY TROUBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the company which came to visit the two officers was an old\r\nacquaintance of Harry Esmond; that gentleman of the Guards, namely,\r\nwho had been so kind to Harry when Captain Westbury's troop had been\r\nquartered at Castlewood more than seven years before. Dick the Scholar\r\nwas no longer Dick the Trooper now, but Captain Steele of Lucas's\r\nFusiliers, and secretary to my Lord Cutts, that famous officer of King\r\nWilliam's, the bravest and most beloved man of the English army. The\r\ntwo jolly prisoners had been drinking with a party of friends (for\r\nour cellar and that of the keepers of Newgate, too, were supplied\r\nwith endless hampers of Burgundy and Champagne that the friends of the\r\nColonels sent in); and Harry, having no wish for their drink or their\r\nconversation, being too feeble in health for the one and too sad in\r\nspirits for the other, was sitting apart in his little room, reading\r\nsuch books as he had, one evening, when honest Colonel Westbury, flushed\r\nwith liquor, and always good-humored in and out of his cups, came\r\nlaughing into Harry's closet and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHo, young Killjoy! here's a\r\nfriend come to see thee; he'll pray with thee, or he'll drink with thee;\r\nor he'll drink and pray turn about. Dick, my Christian hero, here's the\r\nlittle scholar of Castlewood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick came up and kissed Esmond on both cheeks, imparting a strong\r\nperfume of burnt sack along with his caress to the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! is this the little man that used to talk Latin and fetch our\r\nbowls? How tall thou art grown! I protest I should have known thee\r\nanywhere. And so you have turned ruffian and fighter; and wanted to\r\nmeasure swords with Mohun, did you? I protest that Mohun said at the\r\nGuard dinner yesterday, where there was a pretty company of us, that the\r\nyoung fellow wanted to fight him, and was the better man of the two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we could have tried and proved it, Mr. Steele,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond,\r\nthinking of his dead benefactor, and his eyes filling with tears.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of that one cruel letter which he had from his\r\nmistress, Mr. Esmond heard nothing from her, and she seemed determined\r\nto execute her resolve of parting from him and disowning him. But he had\r\nnews of her, such as it was, which Mr. Steele assiduously brought him\r\nfrom the Prince's and Princess's Court, where our honest Captain had\r\nbeen advanced to the post of gentleman waiter. When off duty there,\r\nCaptain Dick often came to console his friends in captivity; a good\r\nnature and a friendly disposition towards all who were in ill-fortune\r\nno doubt prompting him to make his visits, and good-fellowship and good\r\nwine to prolong them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith,\xe2\x80\x9d says Westbury, \xe2\x80\x9cthe little scholar was the first to begin the\r\nquarrel--I mind me of it now--at Lockit's. I always hated that fellow\r\nMohun. What was the real cause, of the quarrel betwixt him and poor\r\nFrank? I would wager 'twas a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Twas a quarrel about play--on my word, about play,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\npoor lord lost great sums to his guest at Castlewood. Angry words passed\r\nbetween them; and, though Lord Castlewood was the kindest and most\r\npliable soul alive, his spirit was very high; and hence that meeting\r\nwhich has brought us all here,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond, resolved never to\r\nacknowledge that there had ever been any other cause but cards for the\r\nduel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not like to use bad words of a nobleman,\xe2\x80\x9d says Westbury; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nif my Lord Mohun were a commoner, I would say, 'twas a pity he was not\r\nhanged. He was familiar with dice and women at a time other boys are at\r\nschool being birched; he was as wicked as the oldest rake, years ere he\r\nhad done growing; and handled a sword and a foil, and a bloody one, too,\r\nbefore he ever used a razor. He held poor Will Mountford in talk that\r\nnight, when bloody Dick Hill ran him through. He will come to a bad end,\r\nwill that young lord; and no end is bad enough for him,\xe2\x80\x9d says honest\r\nMr. Westbury: whose prophecy was fulfilled twelve years after, upon that\r\nfatal day when Mohun fell, dragging down one of the bravest and greatest\r\ngentlemen in England in his fall.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Steele, then, who brought the public rumor, as well as his own\r\nprivate intelligence, Esmond learned the movements of his unfortunate\r\nmistress. Steele's heart was of very inflammable composition; and the\r\ngentleman usher spoke in terms of boundless admiration both of the widow\r\n(that most beautiful woman, as he said) and of her daughter, who, in\r\nthe Captain's eyes, was a still greater paragon. If the pale widow, whom\r\nCaptain Richard, in his poetic rapture compared to a Niobe in tears--to\r\na Sigismunda--to a weeping Belvidera, was an object the most lovely\r\nand pathetic which his eyes had ever beheld, or for which his heart had\r\nmelted, even her ripened perfections and beauty were as nothing compared\r\nto the promise of that extreme loveliness which the good Captain saw\r\nin her daughter. It was matre pulcra filia pulcrior. Steele composed\r\nsonnets whilst he was on duty in his Prince's ante-chamber, to the\r\nmaternal and filial charms. He would speak for hours about them to Harry\r\nEsmond; and, indeed, he could have chosen few subjects more likely to\r\ninterest the unhappy young man, whose heart was now as always devoted\r\nto these ladies; and who was thankful to all who loved them, or praised\r\nthem, or wished them well.\r\n\r\nNot that his fidelity was recompensed by any answering kindness, or\r\nshow of relenting even, on the part of a mistress obdurate now after ten\r\nyears of love and benefactions. The poor young man getting no answer,\r\nsave Tusher's, to that letter which he had written, and being too proud\r\nto write more, opened a part of his heart to Steele, than whom no man,\r\nwhen unhappy, could find a kinder hearer, or more friendly emissary;\r\ndescribed (in words which were no doubt pathetic, for they came imo\r\npectore, and caused honest Dick to weep plentifully) his youth, his\r\nconstancy, his fond devotion to that household which had reared him; his\r\naffection, how earned, and how tenderly requited until but yesterday,\r\nand (as far as he might) the circumstances and causes for which that\r\nsad quarrel had made of Esmond a prisoner under sentence, a widow and\r\norphans of those whom in life he held dearest. In terms that might well\r\nmove a harder-hearted man than young Esmond's confidant--for, indeed,\r\nthe speaker's own heart was half broke as he uttered them--he described\r\na part of what had taken place in that only sad interview which his\r\nmistress had granted him; how she had left him with anger and almost\r\nimprecation, whose words and thoughts until then had been only blessing\r\nand kindness; how she had accused him of the guilt of that blood, in\r\nexchange for which he would cheerfully have sacrificed his own (indeed,\r\nin this the Lord Mohun, the Lord Warwick, and all the gentlemen engaged,\r\nas well as the common rumor out of doors--Steele told him--bore out the\r\nluckless young man); and with all his heart, and tears, he besought\r\nMr. Steele to inform his mistress of her kinsman's unhappiness, and to\r\ndeprecate that cruel anger she showed him. Half frantic with grief\r\nat the injustice done him, and contrasting it with a thousand soft\r\nrecollections of love and confidence gone by, that made his present\r\nmisery inexpressibly more bitter, the poor wretch passed many a lonely\r\nday and wakeful night in a kind of powerless despair and rage against\r\nhis iniquitous fortune. It was the softest hand that struck him, the\r\ngentlest and most compassionate nature that persecuted him. \xe2\x80\x9cI would as\r\nlief,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chave pleaded guilty to the murder, and have suffered\r\nfor it like any other felon, as have to endure the torture to which my\r\nmistress subjects me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough the recital of Esmond's story, and his passionate appeals and\r\nremonstrances, drew so many tears from Dick who heard them, they had\r\nno effect upon the person whom they were designed to move. Esmond's\r\nambassador came back from the mission with which the poor young\r\ngentleman had charged him, with a sad blank face and a shake of the\r\nhead, which told that there was no hope for the prisoner; and scarce a\r\nwretched culprit in that prison of Newgate ordered for execution, and\r\ntrembling for a reprieve, felt more cast down than Mr. Esmond, innocent\r\nand condemned.\r\n\r\nAs had been arranged between the prisoner and his counsel in their\r\nconsultations, Mr. Steele had gone to the dowager's house in Chelsey,\r\nwhere it has been said the widow and her orphans were, had seen my Lady\r\nViscountess, and pleaded the cause of her unfortunate kinsman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\nthink I spoke well, my poor boy,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Steele; \xe2\x80\x9cfor who would not\r\nspeak well in such a cause, and before so beautiful a judge? I did not\r\nsee the lovely Beatrix (sure her famous namesake of Florence was never\r\nhalf so beautiful), only the young Viscount was in the room with the\r\nLord Churchill, my Lord of Marlborough's eldest son. But these young\r\ngentlemen went off to the garden; I could see them from the window\r\ntilting at each other with poles in a mimic tournament (grief touches\r\nthe young but lightly, and I remember that I beat a drum at the coffin\r\nof my own father). My Lady Viscountess looked out at the two boys at\r\ntheir game and said--'You see, sir, children are taught to use weapons\r\nof death as toys, and to make a sport of murder;' and as she spoke she\r\nlooked so lovely, and stood there in herself so sad and beautiful, an\r\ninstance of that doctrine whereof I am a humble preacher, that had I not\r\ndedicated my little volume of the 'Christian Hero'--(I perceive, Harry,\r\nthou hast not cut the leaves of it. The sermon is good, believe me,\r\nthough the preacher's life may not answer it)--I say, hadn't I dedicated\r\nthe volume to Lord Cutts, I would have asked permission to place her\r\nladyship's name on the first page. I think I never saw such a beautiful\r\nviolet as that of her eyes, Harry. Her complexion is of the pink of the\r\nblush-rose, she hath an exquisite turned wrist and dimpled hand, and I\r\nmake no doubt--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you come to tell me about the dimples on my lady's hand?\xe2\x80\x9d broke out\r\nMr. Esmond, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lovely creature in affliction seems always doubly beautiful to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says the poor Captain, who indeed was but too often in a state to see\r\ndouble, and so checked he resumed the interrupted thread of his story.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I spoke my business,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Steele said, \xe2\x80\x9cand narrated to your\r\nmistress what all the world knows, and the other side hath been eager to\r\nacknowledge--that you had tried to put yourself between the two lords,\r\nand to take your patron's quarrel on your own point; I recounted the\r\ngeneral praises of your gallantry, besides my Lord Mohun's particular\r\ntestimony to it; I thought the widow listened with some interest, and\r\nher eyes--I have never seen such a violet, Harry--looked up at mine once\r\nor twice. But after I had spoken on this theme for a while she suddenly\r\nbroke away with a cry of grief. 'I would to God, sir,' she said, 'I had\r\nnever heard that word gallantry which you use, or known the meaning of\r\nit. My lord might have been here but for that; my home might be happy;\r\nmy poor boy have a father. It was what you gentlemen call gallantry came\r\ninto my home, and drove my husband on to the cruel sword that killed\r\nhim. You should not speak the word to a Christian woman, sir, a poor\r\nwidowed mother of orphans, whose home was happy until the world came\r\ninto it--the wicked godless world, that takes the blood of the innocent,\r\nand lets the guilty go free.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the afflicted lady spoke in this strain, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Steele\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cit seemed as if indignation moved her, even more than grief.\r\n'Compensation!' she went on passionately, her cheeks and eyes kindling;\r\n'what compensation does your world give the widow for her husband, and\r\nthe children for the murderer of their father? The wretch who did the\r\ndeed has not even a punishment. Conscience! what conscience has he, who\r\ncan enter the house of a friend, whisper falsehood and insult to a woman\r\nthat never harmed him, and stab the kind heart that trusted him? My\r\nLord--my Lord Wretch's, my Lord Villain's, my Lord Murderer's peers meet\r\nto try him, and they dismiss him with a word or two of reproof and send\r\nhim into the world again, to pursue women with lust and falsehood, and\r\nto murder unsuspecting guests that harbor him. That day, my Lord--my\r\nLord Murderer--(I will never name him)--was let loose, a woman was\r\nexecuted at Tyburn for stealing in a shop. But a man may rob another of\r\nhis life, or a lady of her honor, and shall pay no penalty! I take my\r\nchild, run to the throne, and on my knees ask for justice, and the King\r\nrefuses me. The King! he is no king of mine--he never shall be. He, too,\r\nrobbed the throne from the king his father--the true king--and he has\r\ngone unpunished, as the great do.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI then thought to speak for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Steele continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\ninterposed by saying, 'There was one, madam, who, at least, would have\r\nput his own breast between your husband's and my Lord Mohun's sword.\r\nYour poor young kinsman, Harry Esmond, hath told me that he tried to\r\ndraw the quarrel on himself.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Are you come from HIM?' asked the lady (so Mr. Steele went on) rising\r\nup with a great severity and stateliness. 'I thought you had come from\r\nthe Princess. I saw Mr. Esmond in his prison, and bade him farewell. He\r\nbrought misery into my house. He never should have entered it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Madam, madam, he is not to blame,' I interposed,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr.\r\nSteele.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Do I blame him to you, sir?' asked the widow. 'If 'tis he who sent\r\nyou, say that I have taken counsel, where'--she spoke with a very\r\npallid cheek now, and a break in her voice--'where all who ask may have\r\nit;--and that it bids me to part from him, and to see him no more. We\r\nmet in the prison for the last time--at least for years to come. It\r\nmay be, in years hence, when--when our knees and our tears and our\r\ncontrition have changed our sinful hearts, sir, and wrought our pardon,\r\nwe may meet again--but not now. After what has passed, I could not bear\r\nto see him. I wish him well, sir; but I wish him farewell, too; and if\r\nhe has that--that regard towards us which he speaks of, I beseech him to\r\nprove it by obeying me in this.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I shall break the young man's heart, madam, by this hard sentence,'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mr. Steele said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady shook her head,\xe2\x80\x9d continued my kind scholar. \xe2\x80\x9c'The hearts of\r\nyoung men, Mr. Steele, are not so made,' she said. 'Mr. Esmond will find\r\nother--other friends. The mistress of this house has relented very much\r\ntowards the late lord's son,' she added, with a blush, 'and has promised\r\nme, that is, has promised that she will care for his fortune. Whilst I\r\nlive in it, after the horrid horrid deed which has passed, Castlewood\r\nmust never be a home to him--never. Nor would I have him write to\r\nme--except--no--I would have him never write to me, nor see him more.\r\nGive him, if you will, my parting--Hush! not a word of this before my\r\ndaughter.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere the fair Beatrix entered from the river, with her cheeks flushing\r\nwith health, and looking only the more lovely and fresh for the mourning\r\nhabiliments which she wore. And my Lady Viscountess said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Beatrix, this is Mr. Steele, gentleman-usher to the Prince's Highness.\r\nWhen does your new comedy appear, Mr. Steele?' I hope thou wilt be out\r\nof prison for the first night, Harry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sentimental Captain concluded his sad tale, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, the\r\nbeauty of Filia pulcrior drove pulcram matrem out of my head; and yet\r\nas I came down the river, and thought about the pair, the pallid dignity\r\nand exquisite grace of the matron had the uppermost, and I thought her\r\neven more noble than the virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party of prisoners lived very well in Newgate, and with comforts\r\nvery different to those which were awarded to the poor wretches there\r\n(his insensibility to their misery, their gayety still more frightful,\r\ntheir curses and blasphemy, hath struck with a kind of shame since--as\r\nproving how selfish, during his imprisonment, his own particular grief\r\nwas, and how entirely the thoughts of it absorbed him): if the three\r\ngentlemen lived well under the care of the Warden of Newgate, it was\r\nbecause they paid well: and indeed the cost at the dearest ordinary\r\nor the grandest tavern in London could not have furnished a longer\r\nreckoning, than our host of the \xe2\x80\x9cHandcuff Inn\xe2\x80\x9d--as Colonel Westbury\r\ncalled it. Our rooms were the three in the gate over Newgate--on the\r\nsecond story looking up Newgate Street towards Cheapside and Paul's\r\nChurch. And we had leave to walk on the roof, and could see thence\r\nSmithfield and the Bluecoat Boys' School, Gardens, and the Chartreux,\r\nwhere, as Harry Esmond remembered, Dick the Scholar, and his friend Tom\r\nTusher, had had their schooling.\r\n\r\nHarry could never have paid his share of that prodigious heavy reckoning\r\nwhich my landlord brought to his guests once a week: for he had but\r\nthree pieces in his pockets that fatal night before the duel, when the\r\ngentlemen were at cards, and offered to play five. But whilst he was yet\r\nill at the Gatehouse, after Lady Castlewood had visited him there, and\r\nbefore his trial, there came one in an orange-tawny coat and blue lace,\r\nthe livery which the Esmonds always wore, and brought a sealed packet\r\nfor Mr. Esmond, which contained twenty guineas, and a note saying that\r\na counsel had been appointed for him, and that more money would be\r\nforthcoming whenever he needed it.\r\n\r\n'Twas a queer letter from the scholar as she was, or as she called\r\nherself: the Dowager Viscountess Castlewood, written in the strange\r\nbarbarous French which she and many other fine ladies of that\r\ntime--witness her Grace of Portsmouth--employed. Indeed, spelling was\r\nnot an article of general commodity in the world then, and my Lord\r\nMarlborough's letters can show that he, for one, had but a little share\r\nof this part of grammar:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMONG COUSSIN,\xe2\x80\x9d my Lady Viscountess Dowager wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cje scay que vous\r\nvous etes bravement batew et grievement blessay--du coste de feu M. le\r\nVicomte.

R. H. the Prince of Wales, born\r\nin the same year and month with Frank, and just proclaimed at Saint\r\nGermains, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nI TAKE THE QUEEN'S PAY IN QUIN'S REGIMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fellow in the orange-tawny livery with blue lace and facings was\r\nin waiting when Esmond came out of prison, and, taking the young\r\ngentleman's slender baggage, led the way out of that odious Newgate, and\r\nby Fleet Conduit, down to the Thames, where a pair of oars was called,\r\nand they went up the river to Chelsey. Esmond thought the sun had never\r\nshone so bright; nor the air felt so fresh and exhilarating. Temple\r\nGarden, as they rowed by, looked like the garden of Eden to him, and\r\nthe aspect of the quays, wharves, and buildings by the river, Somerset\r\nHouse, and Westminster (where the splendid new bridge was just\r\nbeginning), Lambeth tower and palace, and that busy shining scene of the\r\nThames swarming with boats and barges, filled his heart with pleasure\r\nand cheerfulness--as well such a beautiful scene might to one who had\r\nbeen a prisoner so long, and with so many dark thoughts deepening the\r\ngloom of his captivity. They rowed up at length to the pretty village\r\nof Chelsey, where the nobility have many handsome country-houses; and\r\nso came to my Lady Viscountess's house, a cheerful new house in the\r\nrow facing the river, with a handsome garden behind it, and a pleasant\r\nlook-out both towards Surrey and Kensington, where stands the noble\r\nancient palace of the Lord Warwick, Harry's reconciled adversary.\r\n\r\nHere in her ladyship's saloon, the young man saw again some of those\r\npictures which had been at Castlewood, and which she had removed thence\r\non the death of her lord, Harry's father. Specially, and in the place of\r\nhonor, was Sir Peter Lely's picture of the honorable Mistress Isabella\r\nEsmond as Diana, in yellow satin, with a bow in her hand and a crescent\r\nin her forehead; and dogs frisking about her. 'Twas painted about the\r\ntime when royal Endymions were said to find favor with this virgin\r\nhuntress; and, as goddesses have youth perpetual, this one believed to\r\nthe day of her death that she never grew older: and always persisted in\r\nsupposing the picture was still like her.\r\n\r\nAfter he had been shown to her room by the groom of the chamber, who\r\nfilled many offices besides in her ladyship's modest household, and\r\nafter a proper interval, his elderly goddess Diana vouchsafed to appear\r\nto the young man. A blackamoor in a Turkish habit, with red boots and a\r\nsilver collar, on which the Viscountess's arms were engraven, preceded\r\nher and bore her cushion; then came her gentlewoman; a little pack of\r\nspaniels barking and frisking about preceded the austere huntress--then,\r\nbehold, the Viscountess herself \xe2\x80\x9cdropping odors.\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond recollected\r\nfrom his childhood that rich aroma of musk which his mother-in-law\r\n(for she may be called so) exhaled. As the sky grows redder and redder\r\ntowards sunset, so, in the decline of her years, the cheeks of my Lady\r\nDowager blushed more deeply. Her face was illuminated with vermilion,\r\nwhich appeared the brighter from the white paint employed to set it off.\r\nShe wore the ringlets which had been in fashion in King Charles's time;\r\nwhereas the ladies of King William's had head-dresses like the towers of\r\nCybele. Her eyes gleamed out from the midst of this queer structure of\r\npaint, dyes, and pomatums. Such was my Lady Viscountess, Mr. Esmond's\r\nfather's widow.\r\n\r\nHe made her such a profound bow as her dignity and relationship merited,\r\nand advanced with the greatest gravity, and once more kissed that\r\nhand, upon the trembling knuckles of which glittered a score of\r\nrings--remembering old times when that trembling hand made him tremble.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarchioness,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, bowing, and on one knee, \xe2\x80\x9cis it only the hand I\r\nmay have the honor of saluting?\xe2\x80\x9d For, accompanying that inward laughter,\r\nwhich the sight of such an astonishing old figure might well produce\r\nin the young man, there was good will too, and the kindness of\r\nconsanguinity. She had been his father's wife, and was his grandfather's\r\ndaughter. She had suffered him in old days, and was kind to him now\r\nafter her fashion. And now that bar-sinister was removed from Esmond's\r\nthought, and that secret opprobrium no longer cast upon his mind, he was\r\npleased to feel family ties and own them--perhaps secretly vain of the\r\nsacrifice he had made, and to think that he, Esmond, was really the\r\nchief of his house, and only prevented by his own magnanimity from\r\nadvancing his claim.\r\n\r\nAt least, ever since he had learned that secret from his poor patron\r\non his dying bed, actually as he was standing beside it, he had felt an\r\nindependency which he had never known before, and which since did not\r\ndesert him. So he called his old aunt Marchioness, but with an air as if\r\nhe was the Marquis of Esmond who so addressed her.\r\n\r\nDid she read in the young gentleman's eyes, which had now no fear of\r\nhers or their superannuated authority, that he knew or suspected the\r\ntruth about his birth? She gave a start of surprise at his altered\r\nmanner: indeed, it was quite a different bearing to that of the\r\nCambridge student who had paid her a visit two years since, and whom\r\nshe had dismissed with five pieces sent by the groom of the chamber. She\r\neyed him, then trembled a little more than was her wont, perhaps, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d in a frightened voice.\r\n\r\nHis resolution, as has been said before, had been quite different,\r\nnamely, so to bear himself through life as if the secret of his birth\r\nwas not known to him; but he suddenly and rightly determined on a\r\ndifferent course. He asked that her ladyship's attendants should be\r\ndismissed, and when they were private--\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, nephew, at least,\r\nmadam, it should be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA great wrong has been done to me and to\r\nyou, and to my poor mother, who is no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare before heaven that I was guiltless of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out,\r\ngiving up her cause at once. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was your wicked father who--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho brought this dishonor on our family,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\r\nfull well. I want to disturb no one. Those who are in present possession\r\nhave been my dearest benefactors, and are quite innocent of intentional\r\nwrong to me. The late lord, my dear patron, knew not the truth until a\r\nfew months before his death, when Father Holt brought the news to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wretch! he had it in confession! he had it in confession!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nout the Dowager Lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so. He learned it elsewhere as well as in confession,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Esmond\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father, when wounded at the Boyne, told the truth to a\r\nFrench priest, who was in hiding after the battle, as well as to the\r\npriest there, at whose house he died. This gentleman did not think fit\r\nto divulge the story till he met with Mr. Holt at Saint Omer's. And\r\nthe latter kept it back for his own purpose, and until he had learned\r\nwhether my mother was alive or no. She is dead years since, my poor\r\npatron told me with his dying breath, and I doubt him not. I do not know\r\neven whether I could prove a marriage. I would not if I could. I do\r\nnot care to bring shame on our name, or grief upon those whom I love,\r\nhowever hardly they may use me. My father's son, madam, won't aggravate\r\nthe wrong my father did you. Continue to be his widow, and give me\r\nyour kindness. 'Tis all I ask from you; and I shall never speak of this\r\nmatter again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais vous etes un noble jeune homme!\xe2\x80\x9d breaks out my lady, speaking, as\r\nusual with her when she was agitated, in the French language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoblesse oblige,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond, making her a low bow. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\nthose alive to whom, in return for their love to me, I often fondly said\r\nI would give my life away. Shall I be their enemy now, and quarrel about\r\na title? What matters who has it? 'Tis with the family still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can there be in that little prude of a woman that makes men so\r\nraffoler about her?\xe2\x80\x9d cries out my Lady Dowager. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was here for a\r\nmonth petitioning the King. She is pretty, and well conserved; but she\r\nhas not the bel air. In his late Majesty's Court all the men pretended\r\nto admire her, and she was no better than a little wax doll. She is\r\nbetter now, and looks the sister of her daughter; but what mean you\r\nall by bepraising her? Mr. Steele, who was in waiting on Prince George,\r\nseeing her with her two children going to Kensington, writ a poem about\r\nher, and says he shall wear her colors, and dress in black for the\r\nfuture. Mr. Congreve says he will write a 'Mourning Widow,' that shall\r\nbe better than his 'Mourning Bride.' Though their husbands quarrelled\r\nand fought when that wretch Churchill deserted the King (for which he\r\ndeserved to be hung), Lady Marlborough has again gone wild about the\r\nlittle widow; insulted me in my own drawing-room, by saying 'twas not\r\nthe OLD widow, but the young Viscountess, she had come to see. Little\r\nCastlewood and little Lord Churchill are to be sworn friends, and have\r\nboxed each other twice or thrice like brothers already. 'Twas that\r\nwicked young Mohun who, coming back from the provinces last year, where\r\nhe had disinterred her, raved about her all the winter; said she was a\r\npearl set before swine; and killed poor stupid Frank. The quarrel was\r\nall about his wife. I know 'twas all about her. Was there anything\r\nbetween her and Mohun, nephew? Tell me now--was there anything? About\r\nyourself, I do not ask you to answer questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond blushed up. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady's virtue is like that of a saint in\r\nheaven, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!--mon neveu. Many saints get to heaven after having a deal to repent\r\nof. I believe you are like all the rest of the fools, and madly in love\r\nwith her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I loved and honored her before all the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take no shame in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she has shut her door on you--given the living to that horrid young\r\ncub, son of that horrid old bear, Tusher, and says she will never see\r\nyou more. Monsieur mon neveu--we are all like that. When I was a young\r\nwoman, I'm positive that a thousand duels were fought about me. And when\r\npoor Monsieur de Souchy drowned himself in the canal at Bruges because I\r\ndanced with Count Springbock, I couldn't squeeze out a single tear, but\r\ndanced till five o'clock the next morning. 'Twas the Count--no, 'twas my\r\nLord Ormond that played the fiddles, and his Majesty did me the honor of\r\ndancing all night with me.--How you are grown! You have got the bel air.\r\nYou are a black man. Our Esmonds are all black. The little prude's son\r\nis fair; so was his father--fair and stupid. You were an ugly little\r\nwretch when you came to Castlewood--you were all eyes, like a young\r\ncrow. We intended you should be a priest. That awful Father Holt--how\r\nhe used to frighten me when I was ill! I have a comfortable director\r\nnow--the Abbe Douillette--a dear man. We make meagre on Fridays always.\r\nMy cook is a devout pious man. You, of course, are of the right way of\r\nthinking. They say the Prince of Orange is very ill indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this way the old Dowager rattled on remorselessly to Mr. Esmond, who\r\nwas quite astounded with her present volubility, contrasting it with her\r\nformer haughty behavior to him. But she had taken him into favor for the\r\nmoment, and chose not only to like him, as far as her nature permitted,\r\nbut to be afraid of him; and he found himself to be as familiar with her\r\nnow as a young man, as, when a boy, he had been timorous and silent.\r\nShe was as good as her word respecting him. She introduced him to her\r\ncompany, of which she entertained a good deal--of the adherents of King\r\nJames of course--and a great deal of loud intriguing took place over her\r\ncard-tables. She presented Mr. Esmond as her kinsman to many persons\r\nof honor; she supplied him not illiberally with money, which he had no\r\nscruple in accepting from her, considering the relationship which he\r\nbore to her, and the sacrifices which he himself was making in behalf\r\nof the family. But he had made up his mind to continue at no woman's\r\napron-strings longer; and perhaps had cast about how he should\r\ndistinguish himself, and make himself a name, which his singular\r\nfortune had denied him. A discontent with his former bookish life and\r\nquietude,--a bitter feeling of revolt at that slavery in which he had\r\nchosen to confine himself for the sake of those whose hardness\r\ntowards him make his heart bleed,--a restless wish to see men and the\r\nworld,--led him to think of the military profession: at any rate,\r\nto desire to see a few campaigns, and accordingly he pressed his new\r\npatroness to get him a pair of colors; and one day had the honor of\r\nfinding himself appointed an ensign in Colonel Quin's regiment of\r\nFusileers on the Irish establishment.\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond's commission was scarce three weeks old when that accident\r\nbefell King William which ended the life of the greatest, the wisest,\r\nthe bravest, and most clement sovereign whom England ever knew.\r\n'Twas the fashion of the hostile party to assail this great prince's\r\nreputation during his life; but the joy which they and all his enemies\r\nin Europe showed at his death, is a proof of the terror in which they\r\nheld him. Young as Esmond was, he was wise enough (and generous enough\r\ntoo, let it be said) to scorn that indecency of gratulation which broke\r\nout amongst the followers of King James in London, upon the death of\r\nthis illustrious prince, this invincible warrior, this wise and moderate\r\nstatesman. Loyalty to the exiled king's family was traditional, as has\r\nbeen said, in that house to which Mr. Esmond belonged. His father's\r\nwidow had all her hopes, sympathies, recollections, prejudices, engaged\r\non King James's side; and was certainly as noisy a conspirator as ever\r\nasserted the King's rights, or abused his opponent's, over a\r\nquadrille table or a dish of bohea. Her ladyship's house swarmed with\r\necclesiastics, in disguise and out; with tale-bearers from St. Germains;\r\nand quidnuncs that knew the last news from Versailles; nay, the exact\r\nforce and number of the next expedition which the French king was to\r\nsend from Dunkirk, and which was to swallow up the Prince of Orange, his\r\narmy and his court. She had received the Duke of Berwick when he landed\r\nhere in '96. She kept the glass he drank from, vowing she never would\r\nuse it till she drank King James the Third's health in it on his\r\nMajesty's return; she had tokens from the Queen, and relics of the saint\r\nwho, if the story was true, had not always been a saint as far as she\r\nand many others were concerned. She believed in the miracles wrought at\r\nhis tomb, and had a hundred authentic stories of wondrous cures effected\r\nby the blessed king's rosaries, the medals which he wore, the locks of\r\nhis hair, or what not. Esmond remembered a score of marvellous tales\r\nwhich the credulous old woman told him. There was the Bishop of Autun,\r\nthat was healed of a malady he had for forty years, and which left\r\nhim after he said mass for the repose of the king's soul. There was M.\r\nMarais, a surgeon in Auvergne, who had a palsy in both his legs, which\r\nwas cured through the king's intercession. There was Philip Pitet, of\r\nthe Benedictines, who had a suffocating cough, which wellnigh\r\nkilled him, but he besought relief of heaven through the merits and\r\nintercession of the blessed king, and he straightway felt a profuse\r\nsweat breaking out all over him, and was recovered perfectly. And\r\nthere was the wife of Mons. Lepervier, dancing-master to the Duke\r\nof Saxe-Gotha, who was entirely eased of a rheumatism by the king's\r\nintercession, of which miracle there could be no doubt, for her surgeon\r\nand his apprentice had given their testimony, under oath, that they did\r\nnot in any way contribute to the cure. Of these tales, and a thousand\r\nlike them, Mr. Esmond believed as much as he chose. His kinswoman's\r\ngreater faith had swallow for them all.\r\n\r\nThe English High Church party did not adopt these legends. But truth and\r\nhonor, as they thought, bound them to the exiled king's side; nor\r\nhad the banished family any warmer supporter than that kind lady of\r\nCastlewood, in whose house Esmond was brought up. She influenced her\r\nhusband, very much more perhaps than my lord knew, who admired his wife\r\nprodigiously though he might be inconstant to her, and who, adverse\r\nto the trouble of thinking himself, gladly enough adopted the opinions\r\nwhich she chose for him. To one of her simple and faithful heart,\r\nallegiance to any sovereign but the one was impossible. To serve King\r\nWilliam for interest's sake would have been a monstrous hypocrisy and\r\ntreason. Her pure conscience could no more have consented to it than to\r\na theft, a forgery, or any other base action. Lord Castlewood might have\r\nbeen won over, no doubt, but his wife never could: and he submitted his\r\nconscience to hers in this case as he did in most others, when he was\r\nnot tempted too sorely. And it was from his affection and gratitude\r\nmost likely, and from that eager devotion for his mistress, which\r\ncharacterized all Esmond's youth, that the young man subscribed to this,\r\nand other articles of faith, which his fond benefactress set him. Had\r\nshe been a Whig, he had been one; had she followed Mr. Fox, and turned\r\nQuaker, no doubt he would have abjured ruffles and a periwig, and have\r\nforsworn swords, lace-coats, and clocked stockings. In the scholars'\r\nboyish disputes at the University, where parties ran very high,\r\nEsmond was noted as a Jacobite, and very likely from vanity as much as\r\naffection took the side of his family.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of the clergy of the country and more than a half of\r\nthe nation were on this side. Ours is the most loyal people in the world\r\nsurely; we admire our kings, and are faithful to them long after they\r\nhave ceased to be true to us. 'Tis a wonder to any one who looks back at\r\nthe history of the Stuart family to think how they kicked their\r\ncrowns away from them; how they flung away chances after chances; what\r\ntreasures of loyalty they dissipated, and how fatally they were bent on\r\nconsummating their own ruin. If ever men had fidelity, 'twas they; if\r\never men squandered opportunity, 'twas they; and, of all the enemies\r\nthey had, they themselves were the most fatal.\r\n\r\nWhen the Princess Anne succeeded, the wearied nation was glad enough to\r\ncry a truce from all these wars, controversies, and conspiracies, and\r\nto accept in the person of a Princess of the blood royal a compromise\r\nbetween the parties into which the country was divided. The Tories\r\ncould serve under her with easy consciences; though a Tory herself,\r\nshe represented the triumph of the Whig opinion. The people of England,\r\nalways liking that their Princes should be attached to their own\r\nfamilies, were pleased to think the Princess was faithful to hers; and\r\nup to the very last day and hour of her reign, and but for that fatality\r\nwhich he inherited from his fathers along with their claims to the\r\nEnglish crown, King James the Third might have worn it. But he neither\r\nknew how to wait an opportunity, nor to use it when he had it; he was\r\nventuresome when he ought to have been cautious, and cautious when\r\nhe ought to have dared everything. 'Tis with a sort of rage at his\r\ninaptitude that one thinks of his melancholy story. Do the Fates deal\r\nmore specially with kings than with common men? One is apt to imagine\r\nso, in considering the history of that royal race, in whose behalf\r\nso much fidelity, so much valor, so much blood were desperately and\r\nbootlessly expended.\r\n\r\nThe King dead then, the Princess Anne (ugly Anne Hyde's daughter, our\r\nDowager at Chelsey called her) was proclaimed by trumpeting heralds\r\nall over the town from Westminster to Ludgate Hill, amidst immense\r\njubilations of the people.\r\n\r\nNext week my Lord Marlborough was promoted to the Garter, and to\r\nbe Captain-General of her Majesty's forces at home and abroad. This\r\nappointment only inflamed the Dowager's rage, or, as she thought it, her\r\nfidelity to her rightful sovereign. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Princess is but a puppet in\r\nthe hands of that fury of a woman, who comes into my drawing-room and\r\ninsults me to my face. What can come to a country that is given over to\r\nsuch a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Dowager: \xe2\x80\x9cAs for that double-faced traitor, my\r\nLord Marlborough, he has betrayed every man and every woman with whom he\r\nhas had to deal, except his horrid wife, who makes him tremble. 'Tis all\r\nover with the country when it has got into the clutches of such wretches\r\nas these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond's old kinswoman saluted the new powers in this way; but some good\r\nfortune at last occurred to a family which stood in great need of it, by\r\nthe advancement of these famous personages who benefited humbler people\r\nthat had the luck of being in their favor. Before Mr. Esmond left\r\nEngland in the month of August, and being then at Portsmouth, where he\r\nhad joined his regiment, and was busy at drill, learning the practice\r\nand mysteries of the musket and pike, he heard that a pension on the\r\nStamp Office had been got for his late beloved mistress, and that the\r\nyoung Mistress Beatrix was also to be taken into court. So much good,\r\nat least, had come of the poor widow's visit to London, not revenge upon\r\nher husband's enemies, but reconcilement to old friends, who pitied, and\r\nseemed inclined to serve her. As for the comrades in prison and the\r\nlate misfortune, Colonel Westbury was with the Captain-General gone to\r\nHolland; Captain Macartney was now at Portsmouth, with his regiment of\r\nFusileers and the force under command of his Grace the Duke of Ormond,\r\nbound for Spain it was said; my Lord Warwick was returned home; and Lord\r\nMohun, so far from being punished for the homicide which had brought so\r\nmuch grief and change into the Esmond family, was gone in company of my\r\nLord Macclesfield's splendid embassy to the Elector of Hanover, carrying\r\nthe Garter to his Highness, and a complimentary letter from the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom such fitful lights as could be cast upon his dark history by the\r\nbroken narrative of his poor patron, torn by remorse and struggling in\r\nthe last pangs of dissolution, Mr. Esmond had been made to understand\r\nso far, that his mother was long since dead; and so there could be\r\nno question as regarded her or her honor, tarnished by her husband's\r\ndesertion and injury, to influence her son in any steps which he might\r\ntake either for prosecuting or relinquishing his own just claims. It\r\nappeared from my poor lord's hurried confession, that he had been made\r\nacquainted with the real facts of the case only two years since, when\r\nMr. Holt visited him, and would have implicated him in one of those many\r\nconspiracies by which the secret leaders of King James's party in this\r\ncountry were ever endeavoring to destroy the Prince of Orange's life or\r\npower: conspiracies so like murder, so cowardly in the means used, so\r\nwicked in the end, that our nation has sure done well in throwing\r\noff all allegiance and fidelity to the unhappy family that could not\r\nvindicate its right except by such treachery--by such dark intrigue and\r\nbase agents. There were designs against King William that were no\r\nmore honorable than the ambushes of cut-throats and footpads. 'Tis\r\nhumiliating to think that a great Prince, possessor of a great and\r\nsacred right, and upholder of a great cause, should have stooped to such\r\nbaseness of assassination and treasons as are proved by the unfortunate\r\nKing James's own warrant and sign manual given to his supporters in this\r\ncountry. What he and they called levying war was, in truth, no better\r\nthan instigating murder. The noble Prince of Orange burst magnanimously\r\nthrough those feeble meshes of conspiracy in which his enemies tried\r\nto envelop him: it seemed as if their cowardly daggers broke upon the\r\nbreast of his undaunted resolution. After King James's death, the\r\nQueen and her people at St. Germains--priests and women for the most\r\npart--continued their intrigues in behalf of the young Prince, James the\r\nThird, as he was called in France and by his party here (this Prince, or\r\nChevalier de St. George, was born in the same year with Esmond's young\r\npupil Frank, my Lord Viscount's son); and the Prince's affairs, being in\r\nthe hands of priests and women, were conducted as priests and women will\r\nconduct them, artfully, cruelly, feebly, and to a certain bad issue. The\r\nmoral of the Jesuits' story I think as wholesome a one as ever was\r\nwrit: the artfullest, the wisest, the most toilsome, and dexterous\r\nplot-builders in the world--there always comes a day when the roused\r\npublic indignation kicks their flimsy edifice down, and sends its\r\ncowardly enemies a-flying. Mr. Swift hath finely described that passion\r\nfor intrigue, that love of secrecy, slander, and lying, which belongs to\r\nweak people, hangers-on of weak courts. 'Tis the nature of such to\r\nhate and envy the strong, and conspire their ruin; and the conspiracy\r\nsucceeds very well, and everything presages the satisfactory overthrow\r\nof the great victim; until one day Gulliver rouses himself, shakes off\r\nthe little vermin of an enemy, and walks away unmolested. Ah! the Irish\r\nsoldiers might well say after the Boyne, \xe2\x80\x9cChange kings with us and we\r\nwill fight it over again.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, the fight was not fair between the\r\ntwo. 'Twas a weak, priest-ridden, woman-ridden man, with such puny\r\nallies and weapons as his own poor nature led him to choose, contending\r\nagainst the schemes, the generalship, the wisdom, and the heart of a\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nOn one of these many coward's errands then, (for, as I view them now,\r\nI can call them no less,) Mr. Holt had come to my lord at Castlewood,\r\nproposing some infallible plan for the Prince of Orange's destruction,\r\nin which my Lord Viscount, loyalist as he was, had indignantly refused\r\nto join. As far as Mr. Esmond could gather from his dying words, Holt\r\ncame to my lord with a plan of insurrection, and offer of the renewal,\r\nin his person, of that marquis's title which King James had conferred on\r\nthe preceding viscount; and on refusal of this bribe, a threat was made,\r\non Holt's part, to upset my Lord Viscount's claim to his estate and\r\ntitle of Castlewood altogether. To back this astounding piece of\r\nintelligence, of which Henry Esmond's patron now had the first light,\r\nHolt came armed with the late lord's dying declaration, after the affair\r\nof the Boyne, at Trim, in Ireland, made both to the Irish priest and a\r\nFrench ecclesiastic of Holt's order, that was with King James's army.\r\nHolt showed, or pretended to show, the marriage certificate of the late\r\nViscount Esmond with my mother, in the city of Brussels, in the year\r\n1677, when the viscount, then Thomas Esmond, was serving with the\r\nEnglish army in Flanders; he could show, he said, that this Gertrude,\r\ndeserted by her husband long since, was alive, and a professed nun in\r\nthe year 1685, at Brussels, in which year Thomas Esmond married\r\nhis uncle's daughter, Isabella, now called Viscountess Dowager of\r\nCastlewood; and leaving him, for twelve hours, to consider this\r\nastounding news (so the poor dying lord said), disappeared with his\r\npapers in the mysterious way in which he came. Esmond knew how, well\r\nenough: by that window from which he had seen the Father issue:--but\r\nthere was no need to explain to my poor lord, only to gather from his\r\nparting lips the words which he would soon be able to utter no more.\r\n\r\nEre the twelve hours were over, Holt himself was a prisoner, implicated\r\nin Sir John Fenwick's conspiracy, and locked up at Hexton first, whence\r\nhe was transferred to the Tower; leaving the poor Lord Viscount, who\r\nwas not aware of the others being taken, in daily apprehension of his\r\nreturn, when (as my Lord Castlewood declared, calling God to witness,\r\nand with tears in his dying eyes) it had been his intention at once to\r\ngive up his estate and his title to their proper owner, and to retire to\r\nhis own house at Walcote with his family. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd would to God I had done\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d the poor lord said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not be here now, wounded to death, a\r\nmiserable, stricken man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord waited day after day, and, as may be supposed, no messenger\r\ncame; but at a month's end Holt got means to convey to him a message\r\nout of the Tower, which was to this effect: that he should consider all\r\nunsaid that had been said, and that things were as they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a sore temptation,\xe2\x80\x9d said my poor lord. \xe2\x80\x9cSince I had come into\r\nthis cursed title of Castlewood, which hath never prospered with me, I\r\nhave spent far more than the income of that estate, and my paternal one,\r\ntoo. I calculated all my means down to the last shilling, and found I\r\nnever could pay you back, my poor Harry, whose fortune I had had for\r\ntwelve years. My wife and children must have gone out of the house\r\ndishonored, and beggars. God knows, it hath been a miserable one for me\r\nand mine. Like a coward, I clung to that respite which Holt gave me. I\r\nkept the truth from Rachel and you. I tried to win money of Mohun, and\r\nonly plunged deeper into debt; I scarce dared look thee in the face when\r\nI saw thee. This sword hath been hanging over my head these two years. I\r\nswear I felt happy when Mohun's blade entered my side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter lying ten months in the Tower, Holt, against whom nothing could\r\nbe found except that he was a Jesuit priest, known to be in King James's\r\ninterest, was put on shipboard by the incorrigible forgiveness of King\r\nWilliam, who promised him, however, a hanging if ever he should again\r\nset foot on English shore. More than once, whilst he was in prison\r\nhimself, Esmond had thought where those papers could be, which the\r\nJesuit had shown to his patron, and which had such an interest for\r\nhimself. They were not found on Mr. Holt's person when that Father was\r\napprehended, for had such been the case my Lords of the Council had seen\r\nthem, and this family history had long since been made public. However,\r\nEsmond cared not to seek the papers. His resolution being taken; his\r\npoor mother dead; what matter to him that documents existed proving his\r\nright to a title which he was determined not to claim, and of which he\r\nvowed never to deprive that family which he loved best in the world?\r\nPerhaps he took a greater pride out of his sacrifice than he would have\r\nhad in those honors which he was resolved to forego. Again, as long as\r\nthese titles were not forthcoming, Esmond's kinsman, dear young Francis,\r\nwas the honorable and undisputed owner of the Castlewood estate and\r\ntitle. The mere word of a Jesuit could not overset Frank's right of\r\noccupancy, and so Esmond's mind felt actually at ease to think the\r\npapers were missing, and in their absence his dear mistress and her son\r\nthe lawful Lady and Lord of Castlewood.\r\n\r\nVery soon after his liberation, Mr. Esmond made it his business to ride\r\nto that village of Ealing where he had passed his earliest years in\r\nthis country, and to see if his old guardians were still alive and\r\ninhabitants of that place. But the only relique which he found of old\r\nM. Pastoureau was a stone in the churchyard, which told that Athanasius\r\nPastoureau, a native of Flanders, lay there buried, aged 87 years. The\r\nold man's cottage, which Esmond perfectly recollected, and the garden\r\n(where in his childhood he had passed many hours of play and reverie,\r\nand had many a beating from his termagant of a foster-mother), were\r\nnow in the occupation of quite a different family; and it was with\r\ndifficulty that he could learn in the village what had come of\r\nPastoureau's widow and children. The clerk of the parish recollected\r\nher--the old man was scarce altered in the fourteen years that had\r\npassed since last Esmond set eyes on him. It appeared she had pretty\r\nsoon consoled herself after the death of her old husband, whom she ruled\r\nover, by taking a new one younger than herself, who spent her money\r\nand ill-treated her and her children. The girl died; one of the boys\r\n'listed; the other had gone apprentice. Old Mr. Rogers, the clerk, said\r\nhe had heard that Mrs. Pastoureau was dead too. She and her husband had\r\nleft Ealing this seven year; and so Mr. Esmond's hopes of gaining any\r\ninformation regarding his parentage from this family were brought to an\r\nend. He gave the old clerk a crown-piece for his news, smiling to think\r\nof the time when he and his little playfellows had slunk out of the\r\nchurchyard or hidden behind the gravestones, at the approach of this\r\nawful authority.\r\n\r\nWho was his mother? What had her name been? When did she die? Esmond\r\nlonged to find some one who could answer these questions to him, and\r\nthought even of putting them to his aunt the Viscountess, who had\r\ninnocently taken the name which belonged of right to Henry's mother.\r\nBut she knew nothing, or chose to know nothing, on this subject, nor,\r\nindeed, could Mr. Esmond press her much to speak on it. Father Holt was\r\nthe only man who could enlighten him, and Esmond felt he must wait until\r\nsome fresh chance or new intrigue might put him face to face with his\r\nold friend, or bring that restless indefatigable spirit back to England\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe appointment to his ensigncy, and the preparations necessary for the\r\ncampaign, presently gave the young gentleman other matters to think of.\r\nHis new patroness treated him very kindly and liberally; she promised\r\nto make interest and pay money, too, to get him a company speedily; she\r\nbade him procure a handsome outfit, both of clothes and of arms, and\r\nwas pleased to admire him when he made his first appearance in his laced\r\nscarlet coat, and to permit him to salute her on the occasion of this\r\ninteresting investiture. \xe2\x80\x9cRed,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, tossing up her old head, \xe2\x80\x9chath\r\nalways been the color worn by the Esmonds.\xe2\x80\x9d And so her ladyship wore\r\nit on her own cheeks very faithfully to the last. She would have him be\r\ndressed, she said, as became his father's son, and paid cheerfully for\r\nhis five-pound beaver, his black buckled periwig, and his fine holland\r\nshirts, and his swords, and his pistols, mounted with silver. Since the\r\nday he was born, poor Harry had never looked such a fine gentleman: his\r\nliberal step-mother filled his purse with guineas, too, some of which\r\nCaptain Steele and a few choice spirits helped Harry to spend in an\r\nentertainment which Dick ordered (and, indeed, would have paid for, but\r\nthat he had no money when the reckoning was called for; nor would the\r\nlandlord give him any more credit) at the \xe2\x80\x9cGarter,\xe2\x80\x9d over against the\r\ngate of the Palace, in Pall Mall.\r\n\r\nThe old Viscountess, indeed, if she had done Esmond any wrong formerly,\r\nseemed inclined to repair it by the present kindness of her behavior:\r\nshe embraced him copiously at parting, wept plentifully, bade him write\r\nby every packet, and gave him an inestimable relic, which she besought\r\nhim to wear round his neck--a medal, blessed by I know not what pope,\r\nand worn by his late sacred Majesty King James. So Esmond arrived at his\r\nregiment with a better equipage than most young officers could afford.\r\nHe was older than most of his seniors, and had a further advantage which\r\nbelonged but to very few of the army gentlemen in his day--many of whom\r\ncould do little more than write their names--that he had read much, both\r\nat home and at the University, was master of two or three languages, and\r\nhad that further education which neither books nor years will give, but\r\nwhich some men get from the silent teaching of adversity. She is a great\r\nschoolmistress, as many a poor fellow knows, that hath held his hand out\r\nto her ferule, and whimpered over his lesson before her awful chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nI GO ON THE VIGO BAY EXPEDITION, TASTE SALT-WATER AND SMELL POWDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first expedition in which Mr. Esmond had the honor to be engaged,\r\nrather resembled one of the invasions projected by the redoubted Captain\r\nAvory or Captain Kidd, than a war between crowned heads, carried on by\r\ngenerals of rank and honor. On the 1st day of July, 1702, a great fleet,\r\nof a hundred and fifty sail, set sail from Spithead, under the command\r\nof Admiral Shovell, having on board 12,000 troops, with his Grace the\r\nDuke of Ormond as the Capt.-General of the expedition. One of these\r\n12,000 heroes having never been to sea before, or, at least, only once\r\nin his infancy, when he made the voyage to England from that unknown\r\ncountry where he was born--one of those 12,000--the junior ensign of\r\nColonel Quin's regiment of Fusileers--was in a quite unheroic state of\r\ncorporal prostration a few hours after sailing; and an enemy, had he\r\nboarded the ship, would have had easy work of him. From Portsmouth\r\nwe put into Plymouth, and took in fresh reinforcements. We were off\r\nFinisterre on the 31st of July, so Esmond's table-book informs him: and\r\non the 8th of August made the rock of Lisbon. By this time the Ensign\r\nwas grown as bold as an admiral, and a week afterwards had the fortune\r\nto be under fire for the first time--and under water, too,--his boat\r\nbeing swamped in the surf in Toros Bay, where the troops landed. The\r\nducking of his new coat was all the harm the young soldier got in this\r\nexpedition, for, indeed, the Spaniards made no stand before our troops,\r\nand were not in strength to do so.\r\n\r\nBut the campaign, if not very glorious, was very pleasant. New sights of\r\nnature, by sea and land--a life of action, beginning now for the first\r\ntime--occupied and excited the young man. The many accidents, and the\r\nroutine of shipboard--the military duty--the new acquaintances, both of\r\nhis comrades in arms, and of the officers of the fleet--served to cheer\r\nand occupy his mind, and waken it out of that selfish depression into\r\nwhich his late unhappy fortunes had plunged him. He felt as if the ocean\r\nseparated him from his past care, and welcomed the new era of life which\r\nwas dawning for him. Wounds heal rapidly in a heart of two-and-twenty;\r\nhopes revive daily; and courage rallies in spite of a man. Perhaps,\r\nas Esmond thought of his late despondency and melancholy, and how\r\nirremediable it had seemed to him, as he lay in his prison a few months\r\nback, he was almost mortified in his secret mind at finding himself so\r\ncheerful.\r\n\r\nTo see with one's own eyes men and countries, is better than reading all\r\nthe books of travel in the world: and it was with extreme delight and\r\nexultation that the young man found himself actually on his grand tour,\r\nand in the view of people and cities which he had read about as a boy.\r\nHe beheld war for the first time--the pride, pomp, and circumstance of\r\nit, at least, if not much of the danger. He saw actually, and with\r\nhis own eyes, those Spanish cavaliers and ladies whom he had beheld\r\nin imagination in that immortal story of Cervantes, which had been\r\nthe delight of his youthful leisure. 'Tis forty years since Mr. Esmond\r\nwitnessed those scenes, but they remain as fresh in his memory as on the\r\nday when first he saw them as a young man. A cloud, as of grief, that\r\nhad lowered over him, and had wrapped the last years of his life in\r\ngloom, seemed to clear away from Esmond during this fortunate voyage and\r\ncampaign. His energies seemed to awaken and to expand under a cheerful\r\nsense of freedom. Was his heart secretly glad to have escaped from that\r\nfond but ignoble bondage at home? Was it that the inferiority to\r\nwhich the idea of his base birth had compelled him, vanished with the\r\nknowledge of that secret, which though, perforce, kept to himself, was\r\nyet enough to cheer and console him? At any rate, young Esmond of the\r\narmy was quite a different being to the sad little dependant of the\r\nkind Castlewood household, and the melancholy student of Trinity Walks;\r\ndiscontented with his fate, and with the vocation into which that drove\r\nhim, and thinking, with a secret indignation, that the cassock and\r\nbands, and the very sacred office with which he had once proposed to\r\ninvest himself, were, in fact, but marks of a servitude which was to\r\ncontinue all his life long. For, disguise it as he might to himself,\r\nhe had all along felt that to be Castlewood's chaplain was to be\r\nCastlewood's inferior still, and that his life was but to be a long,\r\nhopeless servitude. So, indeed, he was far from grudging his old friend\r\nTom Tusher's good fortune (as Tom, no doubt, thought it). Had it been a\r\nmitre and Lambeth which his friends offered him, and not a small living\r\nand a country parsonage, he would have felt as much a slave in one case\r\nas in the other, and was quite happy and thankful to be free.\r\n\r\nThe bravest man I ever knew in the army, and who had been present in\r\nmost of King William's actions, as well as in the campaigns of the great\r\nDuke of Marlborough, could never be got to tell us of any achievement of\r\nhis, except that once Prince Eugene ordered him up a tree to reconnoitre\r\nthe enemy, which feat he could not achieve on account of the horseman's\r\nboots he wore; and on another day that he was very nearly taken prisoner\r\nbecause of these jack-boots, which prevented him from running away.\r\nThe present narrator shall imitate this laudable reserve, and doth not\r\nintend to dwell upon his military exploits, which were in truth not very\r\ndifferent from those of a thousand other gentlemen. This first campaign\r\nof Mr. Esmond's lasted but a few days; and as a score of books have been\r\nwritten concerning it, it may be dismissed very briefly here.\r\n\r\nWhen our fleet came within view of Cadiz, our commander sent a boat\r\nwith a white flag and a couple of officers to the Governor of Cadiz, Don\r\nScipio de Brancaccio, with a letter from his Grace, in which he hoped\r\nthat as Don Scipio had formerly served with the Austrians against the\r\nFrench, 'twas to be hoped that his Excellency would now declare himself\r\nagainst the French King, and for the Austrian in the war between King\r\nPhilip and King Charles. But his Excellency, Don Scipio, prepared a\r\nreply, in which he announced that, having served his former king with\r\nhonor and fidelity, he hoped to exhibit the same loyalty and devotion\r\ntowards his present sovereign, King Philip V.; and by the time this\r\nletter was ready, the two officers had been taken to see the town, and\r\nthe alameda, and the theatre, where bull-fights are fought, and the\r\nconvents, where the admirable works of Don Bartholomew Murillo inspired\r\none of them with a great wonder and delight--such as he had never felt\r\nbefore--concerning this divine art of painting; and these sights over,\r\nand a handsome refection and chocolate being served to the English\r\ngentlemen, they were accompanied back to their shallop with every\r\ncourtesy, and were the only two officers of the English army that saw at\r\nthat time that famous city.\r\n\r\nThe general tried the power of another proclamation on the Spaniards, in\r\nwhich he announced that we only came in the interest of Spain and King\r\nCharles, and for ourselves wanted to make no conquest nor settlement\r\nin Spain at all. But all this eloquence was lost upon the Spaniards, it\r\nwould seem: the Captain-General of Andalusia would no more listen to us\r\nthan the Governor of Cadiz; and in reply to his Grace's proclamation,\r\nthe Marquis of Villadarias fired off another, which those who knew the\r\nSpanish thought rather the best of the two; and of this number was Harry\r\nEsmond, whose kind Jesuit in old days had instructed him, and now had\r\nthe honor of translating for his Grace these harmless documents of war.\r\nThere was a hard touch for his Grace, and, indeed, for other generals in\r\nher Majesty's service, in the concluding sentence of the Don: \xe2\x80\x9cThat he\r\nand his council had the generous example of their ancestors to follow,\r\nwho had never yet sought their elevation in the blood or in the flight\r\nof their kings. 'Mori pro patria' was his device, which the Duke might\r\ncommunicate to the Princess who governed England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether the troops were angry at this repartee or no, 'tis certain\r\nsomething put them in a fury; for, not being able to get possession of\r\nCadiz, our people seized upon Port Saint Mary's and sacked it, burning\r\ndown the merchants' storehouses, getting drunk with the famous wines\r\nthere, pillaging and robbing quiet houses and convents, murdering and\r\ndoing worse. And the only blood which Mr. Esmond drew in this shameful\r\ncampaign, was the knocking down an English sentinel with a half-pike,\r\nwho was offering insult to a poor trembling nun. Is she going to turn\r\nout a beauty? or a princess? or perhaps Esmond's mother that he had lost\r\nand never seen? Alas no, it was but a poor wheezy old dropsical woman,\r\nwith a wart upon her nose. But having been early taught a part of the\r\nRoman religion, he never had the horror of it that some Protestants have\r\nshown, and seem to think to be a part of ours.\r\n\r\nAfter the pillage and plunder of St. Mary's and an assault upon a fort\r\nor two, the troops all took shipping, and finished their expedition, at\r\nany rate, more brilliantly than it had begun. Hearing that the French\r\nfleet with a great treasure was in Vigo Bay, our Admirals, Rooke and\r\nHopson, pursued the enemy thither; the troops landed and carried the\r\nforts that protected the bay, Hopson passing the boom first on board\r\nhis ship the \xe2\x80\x9cTorbay,\xe2\x80\x9d and the rest of the ships, English and Dutch,\r\nfollowing him. Twenty ships were burned or taken in the Port of\r\nRedondilla, and a vast deal more plunder than was ever accounted for;\r\nbut poor men before that expedition were rich afterwards, and so often\r\nwas it found and remarked that the Vigo officers came home with pockets\r\nfull of money, that the notorious Jack Shafto, who made such a figure at\r\nthe coffeehouses and gaming-tables in London, and gave out that he had\r\nbeen a soldier at Vigo, owned, when he was about to be hanged, that\r\nBagshot Heath had been HIS Vigo, and that he only spoke of La Redondilla\r\nto turn away people's eyes from the real place where the booty lay.\r\nIndeed, Hounslow or Vigo--which matters much? The latter was a bad\r\nbusiness, though Mr. Addison did sing its praises in Latin. That honest\r\ngentleman's muse had an eye to the main chance; and I doubt whether she\r\nsaw much inspiration in the losing side.\r\n\r\nBut though Esmond, for his part, got no share of this fabulous booty,\r\none great prize which he had out of the campaign was, that excitement of\r\naction and change of scene, which shook off a great deal of his previous\r\nmelancholy. He learnt at any rate to bear his fate cheerfully. He\r\nbrought back a browned face, a heart resolute enough, and a little\r\npleasant store of knowledge and observation, from that expedition, which\r\nwas over with the autumn, when the troops were back in England again;\r\nand Esmond giving up his post of secretary to General Lumley, whose\r\ncommand was over, and parting with that officer with many kind\r\nexpressions of good will on the General's side, had leave to go to\r\nLondon, to see if he could push his fortunes any way further, and found\r\nhimself once more in his dowager aunt's comfortable quarters at Chelsey,\r\nand in greater favor than ever with the old lady. He propitiated her\r\nwith a present of a comb, a fan, and a black mantle, such as the ladies\r\nof Cadiz wear, and which my Lady Viscountess pronounced became her style\r\nof beauty mightily. And she was greatily edified at hearing of that\r\nstory of his rescue of the nun, and felt very little doubt but that her\r\nKing James's relic, which he had always dutifully worn in his desk, had\r\nkept him out of danger, and averted the shot of the enemy. My lady made\r\nfeasts for him, introduced him to more company, and pushed his fortunes\r\nwith such enthusiasm and success, that she got a promise of a company\r\nfor him through the Lady Marlborough's interest, who was graciously\r\npleased to accept of a diamond worth a couple of hundred guineas, which\r\nMr. Esmond was enabled to present to her ladyship through his aunt's\r\nbounty, and who promised that she would take charge of Esmond's fortune.\r\nHe had the honor to make his appearance at the Queen's drawing-room\r\noccasionally, and to frequent my Lord Marlborough's levees. That\r\ngreat man received the young one with very especial favor, so Esmond's\r\ncomrades said, and deigned to say that he had received the best reports\r\nof Mr. Esmond, both for courage and ability, whereon you may be sure\r\nthe young gentleman made a profound bow, and expressed himself eager to\r\nserve under the most distinguished captain in the world.\r\n\r\nWhilst his business was going on thus prosperously, Esmond had his\r\nshare of pleasure too, and made his appearance along with other young\r\ngentlemen at the coffee-houses, the theatres, and the Mall. He longed to\r\nhear of his dear mistress and her family: many a time, in the midst of\r\nthe gayeties and pleasures of the town, his heart fondly reverted to\r\nthem; and often as the young fellows of his society were making merry\r\nat the tavern, and calling toasts (as the fashion of that day was) over\r\ntheir wine, Esmond thought of persons--of two fair women, whom he had\r\nbeen used to adore almost, and emptied his glass with a sigh.\r\n\r\nBy this time the elder Viscountess had grown tired again of the younger,\r\nand whenever she spoke of my lord's widow, 'twas in terms by no means\r\ncomplimentary towards that poor lady: the younger woman not needing her\r\nprotection any longer, the elder abused her. Most of the family quarrels\r\nthat I have seen in life (saving always those arising from money\r\ndisputes, when a division of twopence halfpenny will often drive the\r\ndearest relatives into war and estrangement,) spring out of jealousy\r\nand envy. Jack and Tom, born of the same family and to the same fortune,\r\nlive very cordially together, not until Jack is ruined when Tom deserts\r\nhim, but until Tom makes a sudden rise in prosperity, which Jack can't\r\nforgive. Ten times to one 'tis the unprosperous man that is angry, not\r\nthe other who is in fault. 'Tis Mrs. Jack, who can only afford a chair,\r\nthat sickens at Mrs. Tom's new coach-and-sick, cries out against her\r\nsister's airs, and sets her husband against his brother. 'Tis Jack who\r\nsees his brother shaking hands with a lord (with whom Jack would like\r\nto exchange snuff-boxes himself), that goes home and tells his wife how\r\npoor Tom is spoiled, he fears, and no better than a sneak, parasite, and\r\nbeggar on horse back. I remember how furious the coffee-house wits were\r\nwith Dick Steele when he set up his coach and fine house in Bloomsbury:\r\nthey began to forgive him when the bailiffs were after him, and abused\r\nMr. Addison for selling Dick's country-house. And yet Dick in the\r\nsponging-house, or Dick in the Park, with his four mares and plated\r\nharness, was exactly the same gentle, kindly, improvident, jovial Dick\r\nSteele: and yet Mr. Addison was perfectly right in getting the money\r\nwhich was his, and not giving up the amount of his just claim, to\r\nbe spent by Dick upon champagne and fiddlers, laced clothes, fine\r\nfurniture, and parasites, Jew and Christian, male and female, who clung\r\nto him. As, according to the famous maxim of Monsieur de Rochefoucault,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin our friends' misfortunes there's something secretly pleasant to us;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n so, on the other hand, their good fortune is disagreeable. If 'tis hard\r\nfor a man to bear his own good luck, 'tis harder still for his friends\r\nto bear it for him and but few of them ordinarily can stand that trial:\r\nwhereas one of the \xe2\x80\x9cprecious uses\xe2\x80\x9d of adversity is, that it is a great\r\nreconciler; that it brings back averted kindness, disarms animosity, and\r\ncauses yesterday's enemy to fling his hatred aside, and hold out a hand\r\nto the fallen friend of old days. There's pity and love, as well as\r\nenvy, in the same heart and towards the same person. The rivalry stops\r\nwhen the competitor tumbles; and, as I view it, we should look at these\r\nagreeable and disagreeable qualities of our humanity humbly alike. They\r\nare consequent and natural, and our kindness and meanness both manly.\r\n\r\nSo you may either read the sentence, that the elder of Esmond's two\r\nkinswomen pardoned the younger her beauty, when that had lost somewhat\r\nof its freshness, perhaps; and forgot most her grievances against the\r\nother, when the subject of them was no longer prosperous and enviable;\r\nor we may say more benevolently (but the sum comes to the same figures,\r\nworked either way,) that Isabella repented of her unkindness towards\r\nRachel, when Rachel was unhappy; and, bestirring herself in behalf of\r\nthe poor widow and her children, gave them shelter and friendship.\r\nThe ladies were quite good friends as long as the weaker one needed a\r\nprotector. Before Esmond went away on his first campaign, his mistress\r\nwas still on terms of friendship (though a poor little chit, a\r\nwoman that had evidently no spirit in her, &c.) with the elder Lady\r\nCastlewood; and Mistress Beatrix was allowed to be a beauty.\r\n\r\nBut between the first year of Queen Anne's reign, and the second, sad\r\nchanges for the worse had taken place in the two younger ladies,\r\nat least in the elder's description of them. Rachel, Viscountess\r\nCastlewood, had no more face than a dumpling, and Mrs. Beatrix was grown\r\nquite coarse, and was losing all her beauty. Little Lord Blandford--(she\r\nnever would call him Lord Blandford; his father was Lord Churchill--the\r\nKing, whom he betrayed, had made him Lord Churchill, and he was Lord\r\nChurchill still)--might be making eyes at her; but his mother, that\r\nvixen of a Sarah Jennings, would never hear of such a folly. Lady\r\nMarlborough had got her to be a maid of honor at Court to the Princess,\r\nbut she would repent of it. The widow Francis (she was but Mrs. Francis\r\nEsmond) was a scheming, artful, heartless hussy. She was spoiling her\r\nbrat of a boy, and she would end by marrying her chaplain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Tusher!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Esmond, feeling a strange pang of rage and\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--Tusher, my maid's son; and who has got all the qualities of\r\nhis father the lackey in black, and his accomplished mamma the\r\nwaiting-woman,\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you suppose that a sentimental\r\nwidow, who will live down in that dingy dungeon of a Castlewood, where\r\nshe spoils her boy, kills the poor with her drugs, has prayers twice a\r\nday and sees nobody but the chaplain--what do you suppose she can do,\r\nmon Cousin, but let the horrid parson, with his great square toes and\r\nhideous little green eyes, make love to her? Cela c'est vu, mon Cousin.\r\nWhen I was a girl at Castlewood, all the chaplains fell in love with\r\nme--they've nothing else to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady went on with more talk of this kind, though, in truth, Esmond\r\nhad no idea of what she said further, so entirely did her first words\r\noccupy his thought. Were they true? Not all, nor half, nor a tenth part\r\nof what the garrulous old woman said, was true. Could this be so? No\r\near had Esmond for anything else, though his patroness chatted on for an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nSome young gentlemen of the town, with whom Esmond had made\r\nacquaintance, had promised to present him to that most charming of\r\nactresses, and lively and agreeable of women, Mrs. Bracegirdle, about\r\nwhom Harry's old adversary Mohun had drawn swords, a few years before my\r\npoor lord and he fell out. The famous Mr. Congreve had stamped with his\r\nhigh approval, to the which there was no gainsaying, this delightful\r\nperson: and she was acting in Dick Steele's comedies, and finally, and\r\nfor twenty-four hours after beholding her, Mr. Esmond felt himself, or\r\nthought himself, to be as violently enamored of this lovely brunette,\r\nas were a thousand other young fellows about the city. To have once seen\r\nher was to long to behold her again; and to be offered the delightful\r\nprivilege of her acquaintance, was a pleasure the very idea of which set\r\nthe young lieutenant's heart on fire. A man cannot live with comrades\r\nunder the tents without finding out that he too is five-and-twenty. A\r\nyoung fellow cannot be cast down by grief and misfortune ever so severe\r\nbut some night he begins to sleep sound, and some day when dinner-time\r\ncomes to feel hungry for a beefsteak. Time, youth and good health, new\r\nscenes and the excitement of action and a campaign, had pretty well\r\nbrought Esmond's mourning to an end; and his comrades said that Don\r\nDismal, as they called him, was Don Dismal no more. So when a party was\r\nmade to dine at the \xe2\x80\x9cRose,\xe2\x80\x9d and go to the playhouse afterward, Esmond\r\nwas as pleased as another to take his share of the bottle and the play.\r\n\r\nHow was it that the old aunt's news, or it might be scandal, about\r\nTom Tusher, caused such a strange and sudden excitement in Tom's old\r\nplayfellow? Hadn't he sworn a thousand times in his own mind that the\r\nLady of Castlewood, who had treated him with such kindness once,\r\nand then had left him so cruelly, was, and was to remain henceforth,\r\nindifferent to him for ever? Had his pride and his sense of justice not\r\nlong since helped him to cure the pain of that desertion--was it even a\r\npain to him now? Why, but last night as he walked across the fields\r\nand meadows to Chelsey from Pall Mall, had he not composed two or three\r\nstanzas of a song, celebrating Bracegirdle's brown eyes, and declaring\r\nthem a thousand times more beautiful than the brightest blue ones that\r\never languished under the lashes of an insipid fair beauty! But Tom\r\nTusher! Tom Tusher, the waiting-woman's son, raising up his little eyes\r\nto his mistress! Tom Tusher presuming to think of Castlewood's widow!\r\nRage and contempt filled Mr. Harry's heart at the very notion; the honor\r\nof the family, of which he was the chief, made it his duty to prevent\r\nso monstrous an alliance, and to chastise the upstart who could dare\r\nto think of such an insult to their house. 'Tis true Mr. Esmond often\r\nboasted of republican principles, and could remember many fine speeches\r\nhe had made at college and elsewhere, with WORTH and not BIRTH for a\r\ntext: but Tom Tusher to take the place of the noble Castlewood--faugh!\r\n'twas as monstrous as King Hamlet's widow taking off her weeds for\r\nClaudius. Esmond laughed at all widows, all wives, all women; and were\r\nthe banns about to be published, as no doubt they were, that very next\r\nSunday at Walcote Church, Esmond swore that he would be present to shout\r\nNo! in the face of the congregation, and to take a private revenge upon\r\nthe ears of the bridegroom.\r\n\r\nInstead of going to dinner then at the \xe2\x80\x9cRose\xe2\x80\x9d that night, Mr. Esmond\r\nbade his servant pack a portmanteau and get horses, and was at Farnham,\r\nhalf-way on the road to Walcote, thirty miles off, before his comrades\r\nhad got to their supper after the play. He bade his man give no hint to\r\nmy Lady Dowager's household of the expedition on which he was going;\r\nand as Chelsey was distant from London, the roads bad, and infested\r\nby footpads, and Esmond often in the habit, when engaged in a party of\r\npleasure, of lying at a friend's lodging in town, there was no need that\r\nhis old aunt should be disturbed at his absence--indeed, nothing more\r\ndelighted the old lady than to fancy that mon cousin, the incorrigible\r\nyoung sinner, was abroad boxing the watch, or scouring St. Giles's. When\r\nshe was not at her books of devotion, she thought Etheridge and Sedley\r\nvery good reading. She had a hundred pretty stories about Rochester,\r\nHarry Jermyn, and Hamilton; and if Esmond would but have run away with\r\nthe wife even of a citizen, 'tis my belief she would have pawned her\r\ndiamonds (the best of them went to our Lady of Chaillot) to pay his\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\nMy lord's little house of Walcote--which he inhabited before he took\r\nhis title and occupied the house of Castlewood--lies about a mile from\r\nWinchester, and his widow had returned to Walcote after my lord's death\r\nas a place always dear to her, and where her earliest and happiest days\r\nhad been spent, cheerfuller than Castlewood, which was too large for her\r\nstraitened means, and giving her, too, the protection of the ex-dean,\r\nher father. The young Viscount had a year's schooling at the famous\r\ncollege there, with Mr. Tusher as his governor. So much news of them Mr.\r\nEsmond had had during the past year from the old Viscountess, his own\r\nfather's widow; from the young one there had never been a word.\r\n\r\nTwice or thrice in his benefactor's lifetime, Esmond had been to\r\nWalcote; and now, taking but a couple of hours' rest only at the inn on\r\nthe road, he was up again long before daybreak, and made such good speed\r\nthat he was at Walcote by two o'clock of the day. He rid to the end of\r\nthe village, where he alighted and sent a man thence to Mr. Tusher, with\r\na message that a gentleman from London would speak with him on urgent\r\nbusiness. The messenger came back to say the Doctor was in town, most\r\nlikely at prayers in the Cathedral. My Lady Viscountess was there, too;\r\nshe always went to Cathedral prayers every day.\r\n\r\nThe horses belonged to the post-house at Winchester. Esmond mounted\r\nagain and rode on to the \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge;\xe2\x80\x9d whence he walked, leaving his\r\ngrumbling domestic at last happy with a dinner, straight to the\r\nCathedral. The organ was playing: the winter's day was already growing\r\ngray: as he passed under the street-arch into the Cathedral yard, and\r\nmade his way into the ancient solemn edifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE 29TH DECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was scarce a score of persons in the Cathedral beside the Dean and\r\nsome of his clergy, and the choristers, young and old, that performed\r\nthe beautiful evening prayer. But Mr. Tusher was one of the officiants,\r\nand read from the eagle in an authoritative voice, and a great black\r\nperiwig; and in the stalls, still in her black widow's hood, sat\r\nEsmond's dear mistress, her son by her side, very much grown, and indeed\r\na noble-looking youth, with his mother's eyes, and his father's curling\r\nbrown hair, that fell over his point de Venise--a pretty picture such\r\nas Van Dyck might have painted. Mons. Rigaud's portrait of my Lord\r\nViscount, done at Paris afterwards, gives but a French version of his\r\nmanly, frank, English face. When he looked up there were two sapphire\r\nbeams out of his eyes such as no painter's palette has the color to\r\nmatch, I think. On this day there was not much chance of seeing that\r\nparticular beauty of my young lord's countenance; for the truth is, he\r\nkept his eyes shut for the most part, and, the anthem being rather long,\r\nwas asleep.\r\n\r\nBut the music ceasing, my lord woke up, looking about him, and his eyes\r\nlighting on Mr. Esmond, who was sitting opposite him, gazing with no\r\nsmall tenderness and melancholy upon two persons who had so much of his\r\nheart for so many years, Lord Castlewood, with a start, pulled at his\r\nmother's sleeve (her face had scarce been lifted from her book), and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d so loud, that Esmond could hear on the other side\r\nof the church, and the old Dean on his throned stall. Lady Castlewood\r\nlooked for an instant as her son bade her, and held up a warning finger\r\nto Frank; Esmond felt his whole face flush, and his heart throbbing,\r\nas that dear lady beheld him once more. The rest of the prayers were\r\nspeedily over; Mr. Esmond did not hear them; nor did his mistress, very\r\nlikely, whose hood went more closely over her face, and who never lifted\r\nher head again until the service was over, the blessing given, and Mr.\r\nDean, and his procession of ecclesiastics, out of the inner chapel.\r\n\r\nYoung Castlewood came clambering over the stalls before the clergy were\r\nfairly gone, and running up to Esmond, eagerly embraced him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\r\ndearest old Harry!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9care you come back? Have you been to the\r\nwars? You'll take me with you when you go again? Why didn't you write to\r\nus? Come to mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond could hardly say more than a \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nhis heart was very full and grateful at all this tenderness on the lad's\r\npart; and he was as much moved at seeing Frank as he was fearful about\r\nthat other interview which was now to take place: for he knew not if the\r\nwidow would reject him as she had done so cruelly a year ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was kind of you to come back to us, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Esmond said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you might come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe read of the fleet coming to Portsmouth. Why did you not come from\r\nPortsmouth?\xe2\x80\x9d Frank asked, or my Lord Viscount, as he now must be called.\r\n\r\nEsmond had thought of that too. He would have given one of his eyes so\r\nthat he might see his dear friends again once more; but believing\r\nthat his mistress had forbidden him her house, he had obeyed her, and\r\nremained at a distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had but to ask, and you know I would be here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand, her little fair hand; there was only her marriage\r\nring on it. The quarrel was all over. The year of grief and estrangement\r\nwas passed. They never had been separated. His mistress had never been\r\nout of his mind all that time. No, not once. No, not in the prison; nor\r\nin the camp; nor on shore before the enemy; nor at sea under the stars\r\nof solemn midnight; nor as he watched the glorious rising of the dawn:\r\nnot even at the table, where he sat carousing with friends, or at the\r\ntheatre yonder, where he tried to fancy that other eyes were brighter\r\nthan hers. Brighter eyes there might be, and faces more beautiful, but\r\nnone so dear--no voice so sweet as that of his beloved mistress, who\r\nhad been sister, mother, goddess to him during his youth--goddess now no\r\nmore, for he knew of her weaknesses; and by thought, by suffering,\r\nand that experience it brings, was older now than she; but more fondly\r\ncherished as woman perhaps than ever she had been adored as divinity.\r\nWhat is it? Where lies it? the secret which makes one little hand the\r\ndearest of all? Whoever can unriddle that mystery? Here she was, her son\r\nby his side, his dear boy. Here she was, weeping and happy. She took\r\nhis hand in both hers; he felt her tears. It was a rapture of\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes Squaretoes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Frank. \xe2\x80\x9cHere's Tusher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTusher, indeed, now appeared, creaking on his great heels. Mr. Tom had\r\ndivested himself of his alb or surplice, and came forward habited in his\r\ncassock and great black periwig. How had Esmond ever been for a moment\r\njealous of this fellow?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us thy hand, Tom Tusher,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The chaplain made him a very\r\nlow and stately bow. \xe2\x80\x9cI am charmed to see Captain Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nlord and I have read the Reddas incolumem precor, and applied it, I am\r\nsure, to you. You come back with Gaditanian laurels; when I heard you\r\nwere bound thither, I wished, I am sure, I was another Septimius. My\r\nLord Viscount, your lordship remembers Septimi, Gades aditure mecum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's an angle of earth that I love better than Gades, Tusher,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nMr. Esmond. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis that one where your reverence hath a parsonage, and\r\nwhere our youth was brought up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA house that has so many sacred recollections to me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Tusher\r\n(and Harry remembered how Tom's father used to flog him there)--\xe2\x80\x9ca house\r\nnear to that of my respected patron, my most honored patroness, must\r\never be a dear abode to me. But, madam, the verger waits to close the\r\ngates on your ladyship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Harry's coming home to supper. Huzzay! huzzay!\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, I shall run home and bid Beatrix put her ribbons on. Beatrix is\r\na maid of honor, Harry. Such a fine set-up minx!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour heart was never in the Church, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d the widow said, in her\r\nsweet low tone, as they walked away together. (Now, it seemed they never\r\nhad been parted, and again, as if they had been ages asunder.) \xe2\x80\x9cI always\r\nthought you had no vocation that way; and that 'twas a pity to shut you\r\nout from the world. You would but have pined and chafed at Castlewood:\r\nand 'tis better you should make a name for yourself. I often said so to\r\nmy dear lord. How he loved you! 'Twas my lord that made you stay with\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked no better than to stay near you always,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to go was best, Harry. When the world cannot give peace, you will\r\nknow where to find it; but one of your strong imagination and eager\r\ndesires must try the world first before he tires of it. 'Twas not to be\r\nthought of, or if it once was, it was only by my selfishness, that you\r\nshould remain as chaplain to a country gentleman and tutor to a little\r\nboy. You are of the blood of the Esmonds, kinsman; and that was always\r\nwild in youth. Look at Francis. He is but fifteen, and I scarce can keep\r\nhim in my nest. His talk is all of war and pleasure, and he longs to\r\nserve in the next campaign. Perhaps he and the young Lord Churchill\r\nshall go the next. Lord Marlborough has been good to us. You know how\r\nkind they were in my misfortune. And so was your--your father's widow.\r\nNo one knows how good the world is, till grief comes to try us. 'Tis\r\nthrough my Lady Marlborough's goodness that Beatrix hath her place at\r\nCourt; and Frank is under my Lord Chamberlain. And the dowager lady,\r\nyour father's widow, has promised to provide for you--has she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes. As far as present favor went, Lady Castlewood was\r\nvery good to him. And should her mind change,\xe2\x80\x9d he added gayly, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nladies' minds will, I am strong enough to bear my own burden, and make\r\nmy way somehow. Not by the sword very likely. Thousands have a better\r\ngenius for that than I, but there are many ways in which a young man of\r\ngood parts and education can get on in the world; and I am pretty sure,\r\none way or other, of promotion!\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, he had found patrons already in\r\nthe army, and amongst persons very able to serve him, too; and told his\r\nmistress of the flattering aspect of fortune. They walked as though\r\nthey had never been parted, slowly, with the gray twilight closing round\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now we are drawing near to home,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would\r\ncome, Harry, if--if it was but to forgive me for having spoken unjustly\r\nto you after that horrid--horrid misfortune. I was half frantic with\r\ngrief then when I saw you. And I know now--they have told me. That\r\nwretch, whose name I can never mention, even has said it: how you tried\r\nto avert the quarrel, and would have taken it on yourself, my poor\r\nchild: but it was God's will that I should be punished, and that my dear\r\nlord should fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me his blessing on his death-bed,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond said. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God for\r\nthat legacy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen, amen! dear Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, pressing his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it.\r\nMr. Atterbury, of St. Bride's, who was called to him, told me so. And I\r\nthanked God, too, and in my prayers ever since remembered it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had spared me many a bitter night, had you told me sooner,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nEsmond said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, in a tone of such sweet humility,\r\nas made Esmond repent that he should ever have dared to reproach her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow how wicked my heart has been; and I have suffered too, my dear. I\r\nconfessed to Mr. Atterbury--I must not tell any more. He--I said I\r\nwould not write to you or go to you--and it was better even that having\r\nparted, we should part. But I knew you would come back--I own that. That\r\nis no one's fault. And to-day, Henry, in the anthem, when they sang\r\nit, 'When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion, we were like them that\r\ndream,' I thought, yes, like them that dream--them that dream. And then\r\nit went, 'They that sow in tears shall reap in joy; and he that goeth\r\nforth and weepeth, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing\r\nhis sheaves with him;' I looked up from the book, and saw you. I was not\r\nsurprised when I saw you. I knew you would come, my dear, and saw the\r\ngold sunshine round your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled an almost wild smile as she looked up at him. The moon was up\r\nby this time, glittering keen in the frosty sky. He could see, for the\r\nfirst time now clearly, her sweet careworn face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what day it is?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the 29th of\r\nDecember--it is your birthday! But last year we did not drink it--no,\r\nno. My lord was cold, and my Harry was likely to die: and my brain\r\nwas in a fever; and we had no wine. But now--now you are come again,\r\nbringing your sheaves with you, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d She burst into a wild flood of\r\nweeping as she spoke; she laughed and sobbed on the young man's heart,\r\ncrying out wildly, \xe2\x80\x9cbringing your sheaves with you--your sheaves with\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he had sometimes felt, gazing up from the deck at midnight into the\r\nboundless starlit depths overhead, in a rapture of devout wonder at that\r\nendless brightness and beauty--in some such a way now, the depth of this\r\npure devotion (which was, for the first time, revealed to him) quite\r\nsmote upon him, and filled his heart with thanksgiving. Gracious God,\r\nwho was he, weak and friendless creature, that such a love should be\r\npoured out upon him? Not in vain--not in vain has he lived--hard and\r\nthankless should he be to think so--that has such a treasure given him.\r\nWhat is ambition compared to that, but selfish vanity? To be rich, to be\r\nfamous? What do these profit a year hence, when other names sound louder\r\nthan yours, when you lie hidden away under the ground, along with\r\nidle titles engraven on your coffin? But only true love lives after\r\nyou--follows your memory with secret blessing--or precedes you, and\r\nintercedes for you. Non omnis moriar--if dying, I yet live in a tender\r\nheart or two; nor am lost and hopeless living, if a sainted departed\r\nsoul still loves and prays for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf--if 'tis so, dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Esmond said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should I ever leave\r\nyou? If God hath given me this great boon--and near or far from me, as I\r\nknow now, the heart of my dearest mistress follows me, let me have that\r\nblessing near me, nor ever part with it till death separate us. Come\r\naway--leave this Europe, this place which has so many sad recollections\r\nfor you. Begin a new life in a new world. My good lord often talked\r\nof visiting that land in Virginia which King Charles gave us--gave his\r\nancestor. Frank will give us that. No man there will ask if there is a\r\nblot on my name, or inquire in the woods what my title is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my children--and my duty--and my good father, Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d she broke\r\nout. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has none but me now! for soon my sister will leave him, and the\r\nold man will be alone. He has conformed since the new Queen's reign; and\r\nhere in Winchester, where they love him, they have found a church for\r\nhim. When the children leave me, I will stay with him. I cannot follow\r\nthem into the great world, where their way lies--it scares me. They will\r\ncome and visit me; and you will, sometimes, Henry--yes, sometimes, as\r\nnow, in the Holy Advent season, when I have seen and blessed you once\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would leave all to follow you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Esmond; \xe2\x80\x9cand can you not be\r\nas generous for me, dear lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and it was with a mother's sweet plaintive tone\r\nand look that she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world is beginning for you. For me, I have\r\nbeen so weak and sinful that I must leave it, and pray out an expiation,\r\ndear Henry. Had we houses of religion as there were once, and many\r\ndivines of our Church would have them again, I often think I would\r\nretire to one and pass my life in penance. But I would love you\r\nstill--yes, there is no sin in such a love as mine now; and my dear lord\r\nin heaven may see my heart; and knows the tears that have washed my sin\r\naway--and now--now my duty is here, by my children whilst they need me,\r\nand by my poor old father, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not by me?\xe2\x80\x9d Henry said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d she said again, and raised her hand up to his lip. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nyour nurse. You could not see me, Harry, when you were in the small-pox,\r\nand I came and sat by you. Ah! I prayed that I might die, but it would\r\nhave been in sin, Henry. Oh, it is horrid to look back to that time.\r\nIt is over now and past, and it has been forgiven me. When you need me\r\nagain, I will come ever so far. When your heart is wounded, then come\r\nto me, my dear. Be silent! let me say all. You never loved me, dear\r\nHenry--no, you do not now, and I thank heaven for it. I used to watch\r\nyou, and knew by a thousand signs that it was so. Do you remember how\r\nglad you were to go away to college? 'Twas I sent you. I told my papa\r\nthat, and Mr. Atterbury too, when I spoke to him in London. And they\r\nboth gave me absolution--both--and they are godly men, having authority\r\nto bind and to loose. And they forgave me, as my dear lord forgave me\r\nbefore he went to heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the angels are not all in heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Esmond said. And as\r\na brother folds a sister to his heart; and as a mother cleaves to her\r\nson's breast--so for a few moments Esmond's beloved mistress came to him\r\nand blessed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nI AM MADE WELCOME AT WALCOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they came up to the house at Walcote, the windows from within were\r\nlighted up with friendly welcome; the supper-table was spread in the\r\noak-parlor; it seemed as if forgiveness and love were awaiting the\r\nreturning prodigal. Two or three familiar faces of domestics were on the\r\nlook-out at the porch--the old housekeeper was there, and young Lockwood\r\nfrom Castlewood in my lord's livery of tawny and blue. His dear mistress\r\npressed his arm as they passed into the hall. Her eyes beamed out on him\r\nwith affection indescribable. \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome,\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said, as she looked\r\nup, putting back her fair curls and black hood. A sweet rosy smile\r\nblushed on her face; Harry thought he had never seen her look so\r\ncharming. Her face was lighted with a joy that was brighter than\r\nbeauty--she took a hand of her son who was in the hall waiting his\r\nmother--she did not quit Esmond's arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome, Harry!\xe2\x80\x9d my young lord echoed after her. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, we are all come\r\nto say so. Here's old Pincot, hasn't she grown handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d and Pincot,\r\nwho was older, and no handsomer than usual, made a curtsy to the\r\nCaptain, as she called Esmond, and told my lord to \xe2\x80\x9cHave done, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here's Jack Lockwood. He'll make a famous grenadier, Jack; and so\r\nshall I; we'll both 'list under you, Cousin. As soon as I'm seventeen,\r\nI go to the army--every gentleman goes to the army. Look! who comes\r\nhere--ho, ho!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis Mistress Trix, with a new\r\nribbon; I knew she would put one on as soon as she heard a captain was\r\ncoming to supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis laughing colloquy took place in the hall of Walcote House: in the\r\nmidst of which is a staircase that leads from an open gallery, where are\r\nthe doors of the sleeping chambers: and from one of these, a wax candle\r\nin her hand, and illuminating her, came Mistress Beatrix--the light\r\nfalling indeed upon the scarlet ribbon which she wore, and upon the most\r\nbrilliant white neck in the world.\r\n\r\nEsmond had left a child and found a woman, grown beyond the common\r\nheight; and arrived at such a dazzling completeness of beauty, that\r\nhis eyes might well show surprise and delight at beholding her. In hers\r\nthere was a brightness so lustrous and melting, that I have seen a whole\r\nassembly follow her as if by an attraction irresistible: and that night\r\nthe great Duke was at the playhouse after Ramillies, every soul turned\r\nand looked (she chanced to enter at the opposite side of the theatre at\r\nthe same moment) at her, and not at him. She was a brown beauty: that\r\nis, her eyes, hair, and eyebrows and eyelashes were dark: her hair\r\ncurling with rich undulations, and waving over her shoulders; but her\r\ncomplexion was as dazzling white as snow in sunshine; except her cheeks,\r\nwhich were a bright red, and her lips, which were of a still deeper\r\ncrimson. Her mouth and chin, they said, were too large and full, and so\r\nthey might be for a goddess in marble, but not for a woman whose eyes\r\nwere fire, whose look was love, whose voice was the sweetest low song,\r\nwhose shape was perfect symmetry, health, decision, activity, whose\r\nfoot as it planted itself on the ground was firm but flexible, and whose\r\nmotion, whether rapid or slow, was always perfect grace--agile as\r\na nymph, lofty as a queen,--now melting, now imperious, now\r\nsarcastic--there was no single movement of hers but was beautiful. As he\r\nthinks of her, he who writes feels young again, and remembers a paragon.\r\n\r\nSo she came holding her dress with one fair rounded arm, and her taper\r\nbefore her, tripping down the stair to greet Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hath put on her scarlet stockings and white shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord,\r\nstill laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my fine mistress! is this the way you set your cap\r\nat the Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d She approached, shining smiles upon Esmond, who could\r\nlook at nothing but her eyes. She advanced holding forward her head, as\r\nif she would have him kiss her as he used to do when she was a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am grown too big! Welcome, cousin Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\nmade him an arch curtsy, sweeping down to the ground almost, with the\r\nmost gracious bend, looking up the while with the brightest eyes and\r\nsweetest smile. Love seemed to radiate from her. Harry eyed her with\r\nsuch a rapture as the first lover is described as having by Milton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN'est-ce pas?\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, in a low, sweet voice, still hanging on\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nEsmond turned round with a start and a blush, as he met his mistress's\r\nclear eyes. He had forgotten her, rapt in admiration of the filia\r\npulcrior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight foot forward, toe turned out, so: now drop the curtsy, and show\r\nthe red stockings, Trix. They've silver clocks, Harry. The Dowager sent\r\n'em. She went to put 'em on,\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, you stupid child!\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss, smothering her brother with kisses;\r\nand then she must come and kiss her mamma, looking all the while at\r\nHarry, over his mistress's shoulder. And if she did not kiss him, she\r\ngave him both her hands, and then took one of his in both hands, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Harry, we're so, SO glad you're come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are woodcocks for supper,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cHuzzay! It was such a\r\nhungry sermon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is the 29th of December; and our Harry has come home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuzzay, old Pincot!\xe2\x80\x9d again says my lord; and my dear lady's lips looked\r\nas if they were trembling with a prayer. She would have Harry lead in\r\nBeatrix to the supper-room, going herself with my young Lord Viscount;\r\nand to this party came Tom Tusher directly, whom four at least out of\r\nthe company of five wished away. Away he went, however, as soon as the\r\nsweetmeats were put down, and then, by the great crackling fire, his\r\nmistress or Beatrix, with her blushing graces, filling his glass\r\nfor him, Harry told the story of his campaign, and passed the most\r\ndelightful night his life had ever known. The sun was up long ere he\r\nwas, so deep, sweet, and refreshing was his slumber. He woke as if\r\nangels had been watching at his bed all night. I dare say one that was\r\nas pure and loving as an angel had blessed his sleep with her prayers.\r\n\r\nNext morning the chaplain read prayers to the little household at\r\nWalcote, as the custom was; Esmond thought Mistress Beatrix did not\r\nlisten to Tusher's exhortation much: her eyes were wandering everywhere\r\nduring the service, at least whenever he looked up he met them. Perhaps\r\nhe also was not very attentive to his Reverence the Chaplain. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nmight have been my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he was thinking; \xe2\x80\x9cthis might have been my duty\r\nfrom now till old age. Well, were it not a pleasant one to be with these\r\ndear friends and part from 'em no more? Until--until the destined lover\r\ncomes and takes away pretty Beatrix\xe2\x80\x9d--and the best part of Tom Tusher's\r\nexposition, which may have been very learned and eloquent, was quite\r\nlost to poor Harry by this vision of the destined lover, who put the\r\npreacher out.\r\n\r\nAll the while of the prayers, Beatrix knelt a little way before Harry\r\nEsmond. The red stockings were changed for a pair of gray, and black\r\nshoes, in which her feet looked to the full as pretty. All the roses\r\nof spring could not vie with the brightness of her complexion; Esmond\r\nthought he had never seen anything like the sunny lustre of her eyes. My\r\nLady Viscountess looked fatigued, as if with watching, and her face was\r\npale.\r\n\r\nMiss Beatrix remarked these signs of indisposition in her mother and\r\ndeplored them. \xe2\x80\x9cI am an old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, with a kind smile; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncannot hope to look as young as you do, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe'll never look as good as you do if she lives till she's a hundred,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says my lord, taking his mother by the waist, and kissing her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I look very wicked, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, turning full round on\r\nEsmond, with her pretty face so close under his chin, that the soft\r\nperfumed hair touched it. She laid her finger-tips on his sleeve as she\r\nspoke; and he put his other hand over hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm like your looking-glass,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cand that can't flatter you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe means that you are always looking at him, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d says her mother,\r\narchly. Beatrix ran away from Esmond at this, and flew to her mamma,\r\nwhom she kissed, stopping my lady's mouth with her pretty hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Harry is very good to look at,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, with her fond eyes\r\nregarding the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf 'tis good to see a happy face,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see that.\xe2\x80\x9d My lady\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d with a sigh; and Harry thought the memory of her dear lord\r\nrose up and rebuked her back again into sadness; for her face lost the\r\nsmile, and resumed its look of melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Harry, how fine we look in our scarlet and silver, and our black\r\nperiwig,\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am tired of my own hair. When shall\r\nI have a peruke? Where did you get your steenkirk, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's some of my Lady Dowager's lace,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry; \xe2\x80\x9cshe gave me this and\r\na number of other fine things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lady Dowager isn't such a bad woman,\xe2\x80\x9d my lord continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe's not so--so red as she's painted,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Beatrix.\r\n\r\nHer brother broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI'll tell her you said so; by the Lord,\r\nTrix, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d he cries out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe'll know that you hadn't the wit to say it, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss\r\nBeatrix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won't quarrel the first day Harry's here, will we, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung lord. \xe2\x80\x9cWe'll see if we can get on to the new year without a fight.\r\nHave some of this Christmas pie. And here comes the tankard; no, it's\r\nPincot with the tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill the Captain choose a dish?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mistress Beatrix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d my lord goes on, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll show thee my horses after\r\nbreakfast; and we'll go a bird-netting to-night, and on Monday there's a\r\ncock-match at Winchester--do you love cock-fighting, Harry?--between\r\nthe gentlemen of Sussex and the gentlemen of Hampshire, at ten pound the\r\nbattle, and fifty pound the odd battle to show one-and-twenty cocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will you do, Beatrix, to amuse our kinsman?\xe2\x80\x9d asks my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll listen to him,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure he has a hundred things\r\nto tell us. And I'm jealous already of the Spanish ladies. Was that\r\na beautiful nun at Cadiz that you rescued from the soldiers? Your man\r\ntalked of it last night in the kitchen, and Mrs. Betty told me this\r\nmorning as she combed my hair. And he says you must be in love, for you\r\nsat on deck all night, and scribbled verses all day in your tablebook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Harry thought if he had wanted a subject for verses yesterday, to-day he\r\nhad found one: and not all the Lindamiras and Ardelias of the poets were\r\nhalf so beautiful as this young creature; but he did not say so, though\r\nsome one did for him.\r\n\r\nThis was his dear lady, who, after the meal was over, and the young\r\npeople were gone, began talking of her children with Mr. Esmond, and of\r\nthe characters of one and the other, and of her hopes and fears for\r\nboth of them. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis not while they are at home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand in their\r\nmother's nest, I fear for them--'tis when they are gone into the world,\r\nwhither I shall not be able to follow them. Beatrix will begin her\r\nservice next year. You may have heard a rumor about--about my Lord\r\nBlandford. They were both children; and it is but idle talk. I know my\r\nkinswoman would never let him make such a poor marriage as our Beatrix\r\nwould be. There's scarce a princess in Europe that she thinks is good\r\nenough for him or for her ambition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's not a princess in Europe to compare with her,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn beauty? No, perhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my lady. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is most beautiful,\r\nisn't she? 'Tis not a mother's partiality that deceives me. I marked\r\nyou yesterday when she came down the stair: and read it in your face.\r\nWe look when you don't fancy us looking, and see better than you think,\r\ndear Harry: and just now when they spoke about your poems--you writ\r\npretty lines when you were but a boy--you thought Beatrix was a pretty\r\nsubject for verse, did not you, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d (The gentleman could only blush\r\nfor a reply.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so she is--nor are you the first her pretty face has\r\ncaptivated. 'Tis quickly done. Such a pair of bright eyes as hers learn\r\ntheir power very soon, and use it very early.\xe2\x80\x9d And, looking at him\r\nkeenly with hers, the fair widow left him.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is--a pair of bright eyes with a dozen glances suffice to\r\nsubdue a man; to enslave him, and inflame him; to make him even forget;\r\nthey dazzle him so that the past becomes straightway dim to him; and he\r\nso prizes them that he would give all his life to possess 'em. What is\r\nthe fond love of dearest friends compared to this treasure? Is memory as\r\nstrong as expectancy? fruition, as hunger? gratitude, as desire? I have\r\nlooked at royal diamonds in the jewel-rooms in Europe, and thought how\r\nwars have been made about 'em; Mogul sovereigns deposed and strangled\r\nfor them, or ransomed with them; millions expended to buy them; and\r\ndaring lives lost in digging out the little shining toys that I value\r\nno more than the button in my hat. And so there are other glittering\r\nbaubles (of rare water too) for which men have been set to kill and\r\nquarrel ever since mankind began; and which last but for a score of\r\nyears, when their sparkle is over. Where are those jewels now that\r\nbeamed under Cleopatra's forehead, or shone in the sockets of Helen?\r\n\r\nThe second day after Esmond's coming to Walcote, Tom Tusher had leave\r\nto take a holiday, and went off in his very best gown and bands to court\r\nthe young woman whom his Reverence desired to marry, and who was not\r\na viscount's widow, as it turned out, but a brewer's relict at\r\nSouthampton, with a couple of thousand pounds to her fortune: for honest\r\nTom's heart was under such excellent control, that Venus herself without\r\na portion would never have caused it to flutter. So he rode away on his\r\nheavy-paced gelding to pursue his jog-trot loves, leaving Esmond to the\r\nsociety of his dear mistress and her daughter, and with his young lord\r\nfor a companion, who was charmed, not only to see an old friend, but to\r\nhave the tutor and his Latin books put out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe boy talked of things and people, and not a little about himself, in\r\nhis frank artless way. 'Twas easy to see that he and his sister had the\r\nbetter of their fond mother, for the first place in whose affections,\r\nthough they fought constantly, and though the kind lady persisted that\r\nshe loved both equally, 'twas not difficult to understand that Frank was\r\nhis mother's darling and favorite. He ruled the whole household (always\r\nexcepting rebellious Beatrix) not less now than when he was a child\r\nmarshalling the village boys in playing at soldiers, and caning them\r\nlustily too, like the sturdiest corporal. As for Tom Tusher, his\r\nReverence treated the young lord with that politeness and deference\r\nwhich he always showed for a great man, whatever his age or his stature\r\nwas. Indeed, with respect to this young one, it was impossible not to\r\nlove him, so frank and winning were his manners, his beauty, his gayety,\r\nthe ring of his laughter, and the delightful tone of his voice. Wherever\r\nhe went, he charmed and domineered. I think his old grandfather the\r\nDean, and the grim old housekeeper, Mrs. Pincot, were as much his\r\nslaves as his mother was: and as for Esmond, he found himself presently\r\nsubmitting to a certain fascination the boy had, and slaving it like the\r\nrest of the family. The pleasure which he had in Frank's mere company\r\nand converse exceeded that which he ever enjoyed in the society of any\r\nother man, however delightful in talk, or famous for wit. His presence\r\nbrought sunshine into a room, his laugh, his prattle, his noble beauty\r\nand brightness of look cheered and charmed indescribably. At the least\r\ntale of sorrow, his hands were in his purse, and he was eager with\r\nsympathy and bounty. The way in which women loved and petted him, when,\r\na year or two afterwards, he came upon the world, yet a mere boy, and\r\nthe follies which they did for him (as indeed he for them), recalled\r\nthe career of Rochester, and outdid the successes of Grammont. His very\r\ncreditors loved him; and the hardest usurers, and some of the rigid\r\nprudes of the other sex too, could deny him nothing. He was no more\r\nwitty than another man, but what he said, he said and looked as no\r\nman else could say or look it. I have seen the women at the comedy at\r\nBruxelles crowd round him in the lobby: and as he sat on the stage more\r\npeople looked at him than at the actors, and watched him; and I remember\r\nat Ramillies, when he was hit and fell, a great big red-haired Scotch\r\nsergeant flung his halbert down, burst out a-crying like a woman,\r\nseizing him up as if he had been an infant, and carrying him out of the\r\nfire. This brother and sister were the most beautiful couple ever seen;\r\nthough after he winged away from the maternal nest this pair were seldom\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nSitting at dinner two days after Esmond's arrival (it was the last day\r\nof the year), and so happy a one to Harry Esmond, that to enjoy it was\r\nquite worth all the previous pain which he had endured and forgot, my\r\nyoung lord, filling a bumper, and bidding Harry take another, drank to\r\nhis sister, saluting her under the title of \xe2\x80\x9cMarchioness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarchioness!\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, not without a pang of wonder, for he was\r\ncurious and jealous already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, with a toss of her head. My Lady\r\nViscountess looked up for a moment at Esmond, and cast her eyes down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Marchioness of Blandford,\xe2\x80\x9d says Frank. \xe2\x80\x9cDon't you know--hath not\r\nRouge Dragon told you?\xe2\x80\x9d (My lord used to call the Dowager of Chelsey by\r\nthis and other names.) \xe2\x80\x9cBlandford has a lock of her hair: the Duchess\r\nfound him on his knees to Mistress Trix, and boxed his ears, and said\r\nDr. Hare should whip him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Mr. Tusher would whip you too,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix.\r\n\r\nMy lady only said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will tell none of these silly stories\r\nelsewhere than at home, Francis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis true, on my word,\xe2\x80\x9d continues Frank: \xe2\x80\x9clook at Harry scowling,\r\nmother, and see how Beatrix blushes as red as the silver-clocked\r\nstockings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had best leave the gentlemen to their wine and their talk,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says Mistress Beatrix, rising up with the air of a young queen, tossing\r\nher rustling flowing draperies about her, and quitting the room,\r\nfollowed by her mother.\r\n\r\nLady Castlewood again looked at Esmond, as she stooped down and kissed\r\nFrank. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not tell those silly stories, child,\xe2\x80\x9d she said: \xe2\x80\x9cdo not drink\r\nmuch wine, sir; Harry never loved to drink wine.\xe2\x80\x9d And she went away,\r\ntoo, in her black robes, looking back on the young man with her fair,\r\nfond face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgad! it's true,\xe2\x80\x9d says Frank, sipping his wine with the air of a lord.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat think you of this Lisbon--real Collares? 'Tis better than your\r\nheady port: we got it out of one of the Spanish ships that came from\r\nVigo last year: my mother bought it at Southampton, as the ship was\r\nlying there--the 'Rose,' Captain Hawkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I came home in that ship,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it brought home a good fellow and good wine,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cI say,\r\nHarry, I wish thou hadst not that cursed bar sinister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not the bar sinister?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I go to the army and am killed--every gentleman goes to the\r\narmy--who is to take care of the women? Trix will never stop at home;\r\nmother's in love with you,--yes, I think mother's in love with you. She\r\nwas always praising you, and always talking about you; and when she\r\nwent to Southampton, to see the ship, I found her out. But you see it is\r\nimpossible: we are of the oldest blood in England; we came in with the\r\nConqueror; we were only baronets,--but what then? we were forced into\r\nthat. James the First forced our great grandfather. We are above titles;\r\nwe old English gentry don't want 'em; the Queen can make a duke any day.\r\nLook at Blandford's father, Duke Churchill, and Duchess Jennings, what\r\nwere they, Harry? Damn it, sir, what are they, to turn up their noses at\r\nus? Where were they when our ancestor rode with King Henry at Agincourt,\r\nand filled up the French King's cup after Poictiers? 'Fore George, sir,\r\nwhy shouldn't Blandford marry Beatrix? By G--! he SHALL marry Beatrix,\r\nor tell me the reason why. We'll marry with the best blood of England,\r\nand none but the best blood of England. You are an Esmond, and you can't\r\nhelp your birth, my boy. Let's have another bottle. What! no more? I've\r\ndrunk three parts of this myself. I had many a night with my father; you\r\nstood to him like a man, Harry. You backed your blood; you can't help\r\nyour misfortune, you know,--no man can help that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder said he would go in to his mistress's tea-table. The young\r\nlad, with a heightened color and voice, began singing a snatch of a\r\nsong, and marched out of the room. Esmond heard him presently calling\r\nhis dogs about him, and cheering and talking to them; and by a hundred\r\nof his looks and gestures, tricks of voice and gait, was reminded of the\r\ndead lord, Frank's father.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the sylvester night passed away; the family parted long before\r\nmidnight, Lady Castlewood remembering, no doubt, former New Years' Eves,\r\nwhen healths were drunk, and laughter went round in the company of him,\r\nto whom years, past, and present, and future, were to be as one; and so\r\ncared not to sit with her children and hear the Cathedral bells ringing\r\nthe birth of the year 1703. Esmond heard the chimes as he sat in his own\r\nchamber, ruminating by the blazing fire there, and listened to the last\r\nnotes of them, looking out from his window towards the city, and the\r\ngreat gray towers of the Cathedral lying under the frosty sky, with the\r\nkeen stars shining above.\r\n\r\nThe sight of these brilliant orbs no doubt made him think of other\r\nluminaries. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so her eyes have already done execution,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nEsmond--\xe2\x80\x9con whom?--who can tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d Luckily his kinsman was by,\r\nand Esmond knew he would have no difficulty in finding out Mistress\r\nBeatrix's history from the simple talk of the boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFAMILY TALK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Harry admired and submitted to in the pretty lad his kinsman was\r\n(for why should he resist it?) the calmness of patronage which my young\r\nlord assumed, as if to command was his undoubted right, and all the\r\nworld (below his degree) ought to bow down to Viscount Castlewood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know my place, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm not proud--the boys at\r\nWinchester College say I'm proud: but I'm not proud. I am simply Francis\r\nJames Viscount Castlewood in the peerage of Ireland. I might have been\r\n(do you know that?) Francis James Marquis and Earl of Esmond in that of\r\nEngland. The late lord refused the title which was offered to him by\r\nmy godfather, his late Majesty. You should know that--you are of our\r\nfamily, you know you cannot help your bar sinister, Harry, my dear\r\nfellow; and you belong to one of the best families in England, in spite\r\nof that; and you stood by my father, and by G--! I'll stand by you.\r\nYou shall never want a friend, Harry, while Francis James Viscount\r\nCastlewood has a shilling. It's now 1703--I shall come of age in 1709.\r\nI shall go back to Castlewood; I shall live at Castlewood; I shall build\r\nup the house. My property will be pretty well restored by then. The late\r\nviscount mismanaged my property, and left it in a very bad state.\r\nMy mother is living close, as you see, and keeps me in a way hardly\r\nbefitting a peer of these realms; for I have but a pair of horses, a\r\ngovernor, and a man that is valet and groom. But when I am of age, these\r\nthings will be set right, Harry. Our house will be as it should be. You\r\nwill always come to Castlewood, won't you? You shall always have your\r\ntwo rooms in the court kept for you; and if anybody slights you, d---\r\nthem! let them have a care of ME. I shall marry early--Trix will be a\r\nduchess by that time, most likely; for a cannon ball may knock over his\r\ngrace any day, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Viscount. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are of the family--you are\r\nfaithful to us, by George, and I tell you everything. Blandford will\r\nmarry her--or\xe2\x80\x9d--and here he put his little hand on his sword--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nunderstand the rest. Blandford knows which of us two is the best weapon.\r\nAt small-sword, or back-sword, or sword and dagger if he likes; I can\r\nbeat him. I have tried him, Harry; and begad he knows I am a man not to\r\nbe trifled with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do not mean,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, concealing his laughter, but not his\r\nwonder, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you can force my Lord Blandford, the son of the first man\r\nof this kingdom, to marry your sister at sword's point?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say that we are cousins by the mother's side, though that's\r\nnothing to boast of. I mean to say that an Esmond is as good as a\r\nChurchill; and when the King comes back, the Marquis of Esmond's sister\r\nmay be a match for any nobleman's daughter in the kingdom. There are\r\nbut two marquises in all England, William Herbert Marquis of Powis, and\r\nFrancis James Marquis of Esmond; and hark you, Harry,--now swear you\r\nwill never mention this. Give me your honor as a gentleman, for you ARE\r\na gentleman, though you are a--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well?\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, a little impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, when after my late viscount's misfortune, my mother went\r\nup with us to London, to ask for justice against you all (as for Mohun,\r\nI'll have his blood, as sure as my name is Francis Viscount Esmond)--we\r\nwent to stay with our cousin my Lady Marlborough, with whom we had\r\nquarrelled for ever so long. But when misfortune came, she stood by her\r\nblood:--so did the Dowager Viscountess stand by her blood,--so did\r\nyou. Well, sir, whilst my mother was petitioning the late Prince of\r\nOrange--for I will never call him king--and while you were in prison, we\r\nlived at my Lord Marlborough's house, who was only a little there, being\r\naway with the army in Holland. And then . . . I say, Harry, you won't\r\ntell, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry again made a vow of secrecy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there used to be all sorts of fun, you know: my Lady Marlborough\r\nwas very fond of us, and she said I was to be her page; and she got Trix\r\nto be a maid of honor, and while she was up in her room crying, we used\r\nto be always having fun, you know; and the Duchess used to kiss me, and\r\nso did her daughters, and Blandford fell tremendous in love with Trix,\r\nand she liked him; and one day he--he kissed her behind a door--he did\r\nthough,--and the Duchess caught him, and she banged such a box of the\r\near both at Trix and Blandford--you should have seen it! And then she\r\nsaid that we must leave directly, and abused my mamma who was cognizant\r\nof the business; but she wasn't--never thinking about anything but\r\nfather. And so we came down to Walcote. Blandford being locked up, and\r\nnot allowed to see Trix. But I got at him. I climbed along the gutter,\r\nand in through the window, where he was crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Marquis,' says I, when he had opened it and helped me in, 'you know I\r\nwear a sword,' for I had brought it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, viscount,' says he--'oh, my dearest Frank!' and he threw himself\r\ninto my arms and burst out a-crying. 'I do love Mistress Beatrix so,\r\nthat I shall die if I don't have her.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My dear Blandford,' says I, 'you are young to think of marrying;' for\r\nhe was but fifteen, and a young fellow of that age can scarce do so, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'But I'll wait twenty years, if she'll have me,' says he. 'I'll\r\nnever marry--no, never, never, never, marry anybody but her. No, not a\r\nprincess, though they would have me do it ever so. If Beatrix will wait\r\nfor me, her Blandford swears he will be faithful.' And he wrote a paper\r\n(it wasn't spelt right, for he wrote 'I'm ready to SINE WITH MY BLODE,'\r\nwhich, you know, Harry, isn't the way of spelling it), and vowing that\r\nhe would marry none other but the Honorable Mistress Gertrude Beatrix\r\nEsmond, only sister of his dearest friend Francis James, fourth Viscount\r\nEsmond. And so I gave him a locket of her hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA locket of her hair?\xe2\x80\x9d cries Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Trix gave me one after the fight with the Duchess that very day.\r\nI am sure I didn't want it; and so I gave it him, and we kissed at\r\nparting, and said--'Good-by, brother.' And I got back through the\r\ngutter; and we set off home that very evening. And he went to King's\r\nCollege, in Cambridge, and I'M going to Cambridge soon; and if he\r\ndoesn't stand to his promise (for he's only wrote once),--he knows I\r\nwear a sword, Harry. Come along, and let's go see the cocking-match at\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . . But I say,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, laughing, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't think\r\nTrix will break her heart about him. La bless you! whenever she sees\r\na man, she makes eyes at him; and young Sir Wilmot Crawley of Queen's\r\nCrawley, and Anthony Henley of Airesford, were at swords drawn about\r\nher, at the Winchester Assembly, a month ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night Mr. Harry's sleep was by no means so pleasant or sweet as it\r\nhad been on the first two evenings after his arrival at Walcote. \xe2\x80\x9cSo the\r\nbright eyes have been already shining on another,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\npretty lips, or the cheeks at any rate, have begun the work which they\r\nwere made for. Here's a girl not sixteen, and one young gentleman is\r\nalready whimpering over a lock of her hair, and two country squires\r\nare ready to cut each other's throats that they may have the honor of a\r\ndance with her. What a fool am I to be dallying about this passion, and\r\nsingeing my wings in this foolish flame. Wings!--why not say crutches?\r\n'There is but eight years' difference between us, to be sure; but in\r\nlife I am thirty years older. How could I ever hope to please such a\r\nsweet creature as that, with my rough ways and glum face? Say that I\r\nhave merit ever so much, and won myself a name, could she ever listen\r\nto me? She must be my Lady Marchioness, and I remain a nameless bastard.\r\nOh! my master, my master!\xe2\x80\x9d (here he fell to thinking with a passionate\r\ngrief of the vow which he had made to his poor dying lord.) \xe2\x80\x9cOh! my\r\nmistress, dearest and kindest, will you be contented with the sacrifice\r\nwhich the poor orphan makes for you, whom you love, and who so loves\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then came a fiercer pang of temptation. \xe2\x80\x9cA word from me,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9ca syllable of explanation, and all this might be changed; but\r\nno, I swore it over the dying bed of my benefactor. For the sake of him\r\nand his; for the sacred love and kindness of old days; I gave my promise\r\nto him, and may kind heaven enable me to keep my vow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day, although Esmond gave no sign of what was going on in his\r\nmind, but strove to be more than ordinarily gay and cheerful when he met\r\nhis friends at the morning meal, his dear mistress, whose clear eyes it\r\nseemed no emotion of his could escape, perceived that something troubled\r\nhim, for she looked anxiously towards him more than once during the\r\nbreakfast, and when he went up to his chamber afterwards she presently\r\nfollowed him, and knocked at his door.\r\n\r\nAs she entered, no doubt the whole story was clear to her at once,\r\nfor she found our young gentleman packing his valise, pursuant to the\r\nresolution which he had come to over-night of making a brisk retreat out\r\nof this temptation.\r\n\r\nShe closed the door very carefully behind her, and then leant against\r\nit, very pale, her hands folded before her, looking at the young man,\r\nwho was kneeling over his work of packing. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe rose up from his knees, blushing, perhaps, to be so discovered, in\r\nthe very act, as it were, and took one of her fair little hands--it was\r\nthat which had her marriage ring on--and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is best that it should be so, dearest lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you were going, at breakfast. I--I thought you might stay. What\r\nhas happened? Why can't you remain longer with us? What has Frank told\r\nyou--you were talking together late last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had but three days' leave from Chelsey,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond said, as gayly as he\r\ncould. \xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt--she lets me call her aunt--is my mistress now! I owe\r\nher my lieutenancy and my laced coat. She has taken me into high favor;\r\nand my new General is to dine at Chelsey to-morrow--General Lumley,\r\nmadam--who has appointed me his aide-de-camp, and on whom I must have\r\nthe honor of waiting. See, here is a letter from the Dowager; the\r\npost brought it last night; and I would not speak of it, for fear of\r\ndisturbing our last merry meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady glanced at the letter, and put it down with a smile that\r\nwas somewhat contemptuous. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no need to read the letter,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nshe--(indeed, 'twas as well she did not; for the Chelsey missive, in the\r\npoor Dowager's usual French jargon, permitted him a longer holiday\r\nthan he said. \xe2\x80\x9cJe vous donne,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth her ladyship, \xe2\x80\x9coui jour, pour vous\r\nfatigay parfaictement de vos parens fatigans\xe2\x80\x9d)--\xe2\x80\x9cI have no need to read\r\nthe letter,\xe2\x80\x9d says she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it Frank told you last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me little I did not know,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Esmond answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have\r\nthought of that little, and here's the result: I have no right to the\r\nname I bear, dear lady; and it is only by your sufferance that I am\r\nallowed to keep it. If I thought for an hour of what has perhaps crossed\r\nyour mind too--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI thought of it; and think of it. I\r\nwould sooner call you my son than the greatest prince in Europe--yes,\r\nthan the greatest prince. For who is there so good and so brave, and who\r\nwould love her as you would? But there are reasons a mother can't tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Esmond, interrupting her with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nthere's Sir Wilmot Crawley of Queen's Crawley, and Mr. Anthony Henley\r\nof the Grange, and my Lord Marquis of Blandford, that seems to be the\r\nfavored suitor. You shall ask me to wear my Lady Marchioness's favors\r\nand to dance at her ladyship's wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Harry, Harry, it is none of these follies that frighten me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nout Lady Castlewood. \xe2\x80\x9cLord Churchill is but a child, his outbreak about\r\nBeatrix was a mere boyish folly. His parents would rather see him buried\r\nthan married to one below him in rank. And do you think that I would\r\nstoop to sue for a husband for Francis Esmond's daughter; or submit to\r\nhave my girl smuggled into that proud family to cause a quarrel between\r\nson and parents, and to be treated only as an inferior? I would disdain\r\nsuch a meanness. Beatrix would scorn it. Ah! Henry, 'tis not with you\r\nthe fault lies, 'tis with her. I know you both, and love you: need I\r\nbe ashamed of that love now? No, never, never, and 'tis not you, dear\r\nHarry, that is unworthy. 'Tis for my poor Beatrix I tremble--whose\r\nheadstrong will frightens me; whose jealous temper (they say I was\r\njealous too, but, pray God, I am cured of that sin) and whose vanity no\r\nwords or prayers of mine can cure--only suffering, only experience, and\r\nremorse afterwards. Oh! Henry, she will make no man happy who loves her.\r\nGo away, my son: leave her: love us always, and think kindly of us: and\r\nfor me, my dear, you know that these walls contain all that I love in\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn after life, did Esmond find the words true which his fond mistress\r\nspoke from her sad heart? Warning he had: but I doubt others had warning\r\nbefore his time, and since: and he benefited by it as most men do.\r\n\r\nMy young Lord Viscount was exceeding sorry when he heard that Harry\r\ncould not come to the cock-match with him, and must go to London, but no\r\ndoubt my lord consoled himself when the Hampshire cocks won the match;\r\nand he saw every one of the battles, and crowed properly over the\r\nconquered Sussex gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAs Esmond rode towards town his servant, coming up to him, informed him\r\nwith a grin, that Mistress Beatrix had brought out a new gown and blue\r\nstockings for that day's dinner, in which she intended to appear, and\r\nhad flown into a rage and given her maid a slap on the face soon after\r\nshe heard he was going away. Mistress Beatrix's woman, the fellow said,\r\ncame down to the servants' hall crying, and with the mark of a blow\r\nstill on her cheek: but Esmond peremptorily ordered him to fall back\r\nand be silent, and rode on with thoughts enough of his own to occupy\r\nhim--some sad ones, some inexpressibly dear and pleasant.\r\n\r\nHis mistress, from whom he had been a year separated, was his dearest\r\nmistress again. The family from which he had been parted, and which he\r\nloved with the fondest devotion, was his family once more. If Beatrix's\r\nbeauty shone upon him, it was with a friendly lustre, and he could\r\nregard it with much such a delight as he brought away after seeing the\r\nbeautiful pictures of the smiling Madonnas in the convent at Cadiz, when\r\nhe was despatched thither with a flag; and as for his mistress, 'twas\r\ndifficult to say with what a feeling he regarded her. 'Twas happiness to\r\nhave seen her; 'twas no great pang to part; a filial tenderness, a love\r\nthat was at once respect and protection, filled his mind as he thought\r\nof her; and near her or far from her, and from that day until now, and\r\nfrom now till death is past and beyond it, he prays that sacred flame\r\nmay ever burn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nI MAKE THE CAMPAIGN OF 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond rode up to London then, where, if the Dowager had been angry\r\nat the abrupt leave of absence he took, she was mightily pleased at his\r\nspeedy return.\r\n\r\nHe went immediately and paid his court to his new general, General\r\nLumley, who received him graciously, having known his father, and also,\r\nhe was pleased to say, having had the very best accounts of Mr. Esmond\r\nfrom the officer whose aide-de-camp he had been at Vigo. During this\r\nwinter Mr. Esmond was gazetted to a lieutenancy in Brigadier Webb's\r\nregiment of Fusileers, then with their colonel in Flanders; but being\r\nnow attached to the suite of Mr. Lumley, Esmond did not join his own\r\nregiment until more than a year afterwards, and after his return from\r\nthe campaign of Blenheim, which was fought the next year. The campaign\r\nbegan very early, our troops marching out of their quarters before the\r\nwinter was almost over, and investing the city of Bonn, on the Rhine,\r\nunder the Duke's command. His Grace joined the army in deep grief of\r\nmind, with crape on his sleeve, and his household in mourning; and the\r\nvery same packet which brought the Commander-in-Chief over, brought\r\nletters to the forces which preceded him, and one from his dear mistress\r\nto Esmond, which interested him not a little.\r\n\r\nThe young Marquis of Blandford, his Grace's son, who had been entered in\r\nKing's College in Cambridge, (whither my Lord Viscount had also gone,\r\nto Trinity, with Mr. Tusher as his governor,) had been seized with\r\nsmall-pox, and was dead at sixteen years of age, and so poor Frank's\r\nschemes for his sister's advancement were over, and that innocent\r\nchildish passion nipped in the birth.\r\n\r\nEsmond's mistress would have had him return, at least her letters hinted\r\nas much; but in the presence of the enemy this was impossible, and\r\nour young man took his humble share in the siege, which need not be\r\ndescribed here, and had the good luck to escape without a wound of any\r\nsort, and to drink his general's health after the surrender. He was\r\nin constant military duty this year, and did not think of asking for a\r\nleave of absence, as one or two of his less fortunate friends did, who\r\nwere cast away in that tremendous storm which happened towards the\r\nclose of November, that \xe2\x80\x9cwhich of late o'er pale Britannia past\xe2\x80\x9d (as\r\nMr. Addison sang of it), and in which scores of our greatest ships and\r\n15,000 of our seamen went down.\r\n\r\nThey said that our Duke was quite heart-broken by the calamity which had\r\nbefallen his family; but his enemies found that he could subdue them,\r\nas well as master his grief. Successful as had been this great General's\r\noperations in the past year, they were far enhanced by the splendor of\r\nhis victory in the ensuing campaign. His Grace the Captain-General went\r\nto England after Bonn, and our army fell back into Holland, where, in\r\nApril 1704, his Grace again found the troops, embarking from Harwich\r\nand landing at Maesland Sluys: thence his Grace came immediately to the\r\nHague, where he received the foreign ministers, general officers, and\r\nother people of quality. The greatest honors were paid to his Grace\r\neverywhere--at the Hague, Utrecht, Ruremonde, and Maestricht; the civil\r\nauthorities coming to meet his coaches: salvos of cannon saluting him,\r\ncanopies of state being erected for him where he stopped, and feasts\r\nprepared for the numerous gentlemen following in his suite. His Grace\r\nreviewed the troops of the States-General between Liege and Maestricht,\r\nand afterwards the English forces, under the command of General\r\nChurchill, near Bois-le-Duc. Every preparation was made for a long\r\nmarch; and the army heard, with no small elation, that it was the\r\nCommander-in-Chief's intention to carry the war out of the Low\r\nCountries, and to march on the Mozelle. Before leaving our camp at\r\nMaestricht, we heard that the French, under the Marshal Villeroy, were\r\nalso bound towards the Mozelle.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of May, the army reached Coblentz; and next day, his\r\nGrace, and the generals accompanying him, went to visit the Elector of\r\nTreves at his Castle of Ehrenbreitstein, the horse and dragoons passing\r\nthe Rhine whilst the Duke was entertained at a grand feast by the\r\nElector. All as yet was novelty, festivity, and splendor--a brilliant\r\nmarch of a great and glorious army through a friendly country, and\r\nsure through some of the most beautiful scenes of nature which I ever\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nThe foot and artillery, following after the horse as quick as possible,\r\ncrossed the Rhine under Ehrenbreitstein, and so to Castel, over against\r\nMayntz, in which city his Grace, his generals, and his retinue were\r\nreceived at the landing-place by the Elector's coaches, carried to\r\nhis Highness's palace amidst the thunder of cannon, and then once more\r\nmagnificently entertained. Gidlingen, in Bavaria, was appointed as the\r\ngeneral rendezvous of the army, and thither, by different routes, the\r\nwhole forces of English, Dutch, Danes, and German auxiliaries took their\r\nway. The foot and artillery under General Churchill passed the Neckar,\r\nat Heidelberg; and Esmond had an opportunity of seeing that city and\r\npalace, once so famous and beautiful (though shattered and battered by\r\nthe French, under Turenne, in the late war), where his grandsire had\r\nserved the beautiful and unfortunate Electress-Palatine, the first King\r\nCharles's sister.\r\n\r\nAt Mindelsheim, the famous Prince of Savoy came to visit our commander,\r\nall of us crowding eagerly to get a sight of that brilliant and intrepid\r\nwarrior; and our troops were drawn up in battalia before the Prince,\r\nwho was pleased to express his admiration of this noble English army. At\r\nlength we came in sight of the enemy between Dillingen and Lawingen, the\r\nBrentz lying between the two armies. The Elector, judging that Donauwort\r\nwould be the point of his Grace's attack, sent a strong detachment of\r\nhis best troops to Count Darcos, who was posted at Schellenberg, near\r\nthat place, where great intrenchments were thrown up, and thousands of\r\npioneers employed to strengthen the position.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of July his Grace stormed the post, with what success on our\r\npart need scarce be told. His Grace advanced with six thousand foot,\r\nEnglish and Dutch, thirty squadrons, and three regiments of Imperial\r\nCuirassiers, the Duke crossing the river at the head of the cavalry.\r\nAlthough our troops made the attack with unparalleled courage and\r\nfury--rushing up to the very guns of the enemy, and being slaughtered\r\nbefore their works--we were driven back many times, and should not have\r\ncarried them, but that the Imperialists came up under the Prince of\r\nBaden, when the enemy could make no head against us: we pursued them\r\ninto the trenches, making a terrible slaughter there, and into the very\r\nDanube, where a great part of his troops, following the example of their\r\ngenerals, Count Darcos and the Elector himself, tried to save themselves\r\nby swimming. Our army entered Donauwort, which the Bavarians evacuated;\r\nand where 'twas said the Elector purposed to have given us a warm\r\nreception, by burning us in our beds; the cellars of the houses, when we\r\ntook possession of them, being found stuffed with straw. But though the\r\nlinks were there, the link-boys had run away. The townsmen saved their\r\nhouses, and our General took possession of the enemy's ammunition in the\r\narsenals, his stores, and magazines. Five days afterwards a great \xe2\x80\x9cTe\r\nDeum\xe2\x80\x9d was sung in Prince Lewis's army, and a solemn day of thanksgiving\r\nheld in our own; the Prince of Savoy's compliments coming to his Grace\r\nthe Captain-General during the day's religious ceremony, and concluding,\r\nas it were, with an Amen.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having seen a great military march through a friendly country;\r\nthe pomps and festivities of more than one German court; the severe\r\nstruggle of a hotly contested battle, and the triumph of victory, Mr.\r\nEsmond beheld another part of military duty: our troops entering the\r\nenemy's territory, and putting all around them to fire and sword;\r\nburning farms, wasted fields, shrieking women, slaughtered sons and\r\nfathers, and drunken soldiery, cursing and carousing in the midst of\r\ntears, terror, and murder. Why does the stately Muse of History, that\r\ndelights in describing the valor of heroes and the grandeur of conquest,\r\nleave out these scenes, so brutal, mean, and degrading, that yet form by\r\nfar the greater part of the drama of war? You, gentlemen of England, who\r\nlive at home at ease, and compliment yourselves in the songs of triumph\r\nwith which our chieftains are bepraised--you pretty maidens, that come\r\ntumbling down the stairs when the fife and drum call you, and huzzah for\r\nthe British Grenadiers--do you take account that these items go to make\r\nup the amount of the triumph you admire, and form part of the duties of\r\nthe heroes you fondle? Our chief, whom England and all Europe, saving\r\nonly the Frenchmen, worshipped almost, had this of the godlike in him,\r\nthat he was impassible before victory, before danger, before defeat.\r\nBefore the greatest obstacle or the most trivial ceremony; before a\r\nhundred thousand men drawn in battalia, or a peasant slaughtered at the\r\ndoor of his burning hovel; before a carouse of drunken German lords, or\r\na monarch's court or a cottage table, where his plans were laid, or an\r\nenemy's battery, vomiting flame and death, and strewing corpses round\r\nabout him;--he was always cold, calm, resolute, like fate. He performed\r\na treason or a court-bow, he told a falsehood as black as Styx, as\r\neasily as he paid a compliment or spoke about the weather. He took a\r\nmistress, and left her; he betrayed his benefactor, and supported him,\r\nor would have murdered him, with the same calmness always, and having\r\nno more remorse than Clotho when she weaves the thread, or Lachesis when\r\nshe cuts it. In the hour of battle I have heard the Prince of Savoy's\r\nofficers say, the Prince became possessed with a sort of warlike fury;\r\nhis eyes lighted up; he rushed hither and thither, raging; he shrieked\r\ncurses and encouragement, yelling and harking his bloody war-dogs on,\r\nand himself always at the first of the hunt. Our duke was as calm at the\r\nmouth of the cannon as at the door of a drawing-room. Perhaps he could\r\nnot have been the great man he was, had he had a heart either for\r\nlove or hatred, or pity or fear, or regret or remorse. He achieved\r\nthe highest deed of daring, or deepest calculation of thought, as he\r\nperformed the very meanest action of which a man is capable; told a lie,\r\nor cheated a fond woman, or robbed a poor beggar of a halfpenny, with a\r\nlike awful serenity and equal capacity of the highest and lowest acts of\r\nour nature.\r\n\r\nHis qualities were pretty well known in the army, where there were\r\nparties of all politics, and of plenty of shrewdness and wit; but there\r\nexisted such a perfect confidence in him, as the first captain of the\r\nworld, and such a faith and admiration in his prodigious genius and\r\nfortune, that the very men whom he notoriously cheated of their pay, the\r\nchiefs whom he used and injured--(for he used all men, great and small,\r\nthat came near him, as his instruments alike, and took something of\r\ntheirs, either some quality or some property)--the blood of a soldier, it\r\nmight be, or a jewelled hat, or a hundred thousand crowns from a king,\r\nor a portion out of a starving sentinel's three-farthings; or (when he\r\nwas young) a kiss from a woman, and the gold chain off her neck, taking\r\nall he could from woman or man, and having, as I have said, this of the\r\ngodlike in him, that he could see a hero perish or a sparrow fall, with\r\nthe same amount of sympathy for either. Not that he had no tears; he\r\ncould always order up this reserve at the proper moment to battle; he\r\ncould draw upon tears or smiles alike, and whenever need was for using\r\nthis cheap coin. He would cringe to a shoeblack, as he would flatter a\r\nminister or a monarch; be haughty, be humble, threaten, repent, weep,\r\ngrasp your hand, (or stab you whenever he saw occasion)--but yet those\r\nof the army, who knew him best and had suffered most from him, admired\r\nhim most of all: and as he rode along the lines to battle or galloped\r\nup in the nick of time to a battalion reeling from before the enemy's\r\ncharge or shot, the fainting men and officers got new courage as they\r\nsaw the splendid calm of his face, and felt that his will made them\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nAfter the great victory of Blenheim the enthusiasm of the army for the\r\nDuke, even of his bitterest personal enemies in it, amounted to a sort\r\nof rage--nay, the very officers who cursed him in their hearts were\r\namong the most frantic to cheer him. Who could refuse his meed of\r\nadmiration to such a victory and such a victor? Not he who writes: a man\r\nmay profess to be ever so much a philosopher; but he who fought on that\r\nday must feel a thrill of pride as he recalls it.\r\n\r\nThe French right was posted near to the village of Blenheim, on the\r\nDanube, where the Marshal Tallard's quarters were; their line extending\r\nthrough, it may be a league and a half, before Lutzingen and up to a\r\nwoody hill, round the base of which, and acting against the Prince of\r\nSavoy, were forty of his squadrons.\r\n\r\nHere was a village that the Frenchmen had burned, the wood being, in\r\nfact, a better shelter and easier of guard than any village.\r\n\r\nBefore these two villages and the French lines ran a little stream, not\r\nmore than two foot broad, through a marsh (that was mostly dried up\r\nfrom the heats of the weather), and this stream was the only separation\r\nbetween the two armies--ours coming up and ranging themselves in line\r\nof battle before the French, at six o'clock in the morning; so that our\r\nline was quite visible to theirs; and the whole of this great plain was\r\nblack and swarming with troops for hours before the cannonading began.\r\n\r\nOn one side and the other this cannonading lasted many hours. The French\r\nguns being in position in front of their line, and doing severe damage\r\namong our horse especially, and on our right wing of Imperialists under\r\nthe Prince of Savoy, who could neither advance his artillery nor his\r\nlines, the ground before him being cut up by ditches, morasses, and very\r\ndifficult of passage for the guns.\r\n\r\nIt was past mid-day when the attack began on our left, where Lord Cutts\r\ncommanded, the bravest and most beloved officer in the English army.\r\nAnd now, as if to make his experience in war complete, our young\r\naide-de-camp having seen two great armies facing each other in line of\r\nbattle, and had the honor of riding with orders from one end to other\r\nof the line, came in for a not uncommon accompaniment of military glory,\r\nand was knocked on the head, along with many hundred of brave fellows,\r\nalmost at the very commencement of this famous day of Blenheim. A little\r\nafter noon, the disposition for attack being completed with much delay\r\nand difficulty, and under a severe fire from the enemy's guns, that\r\nwere better posted and more numerous than ours, a body of English and\r\nHessians, with Major-General Wilkes commanding at the extreme left of\r\nour line, marched upon Blenheim, advancing with great gallantry, the\r\nMajor-General on foot, with his officers, at the head of the column, and\r\nmarching, with his hat off, intrepidly in the face of the enemy, who was\r\npouring in a tremendous fire from his guns and musketry, to which our\r\npeople were instructed not to reply, except with pike and bayonet when\r\nthey reached the French palisades. To these Wilkes walked intrepidly,\r\nand struck the woodwork with his sword before our people charged it.\r\nHe was shot down at the instant, with his colonel, major, and several\r\nofficers; and our troops cheering and huzzaing, and coming on, as they\r\ndid, with immense resolution and gallantry, were nevertheless stopped by\r\nthe murderous fire from behind the enemy's defences, and then attacked\r\nin flank by a furious charge of French horse which swept out of\r\nBlenheim, and cut down our men in great numbers. Three fierce and\r\ndesperate assaults of our foot were made and repulsed by the enemy; so\r\nthat our columns of foot were quite shattered, and fell back, scrambling\r\nover the little rivulet, which we had crossed so resolutely an hour\r\nbefore, and pursued by the French cavalry, slaughtering us and cutting\r\nus down.\r\n\r\nAnd now the conquerors were met by a furious charge of English horse\r\nunder Esmond's general, General Lumley, behind whose squadrons the\r\nflying foot found refuge, and formed again, whilst Lumley drove back the\r\nFrench horse, charging up to the village of Blenheim and the palisades\r\nwhere Wilkes, and many hundred more gallant Englishmen, lay in\r\nslaughtered heaps. Beyond this moment, and of this famous victory, Mr.\r\nEsmond knows nothing; for a shot brought down his horse and our young\r\ngentleman on it, who fell crushed and stunned under the animal, and came\r\nto his senses he knows not how long after, only to lose them again from\r\npain and loss of blood. A dim sense, as of people groaning round about\r\nhim, a wild incoherent thought or two for her who occupied so much of\r\nhis heart now, and that here his career, and his hopes, and misfortunes\r\nwere ended, he remembers in the course of these hours. When he woke up,\r\nit was with a pang of extreme pain, his breastplate was taken off, his\r\nservant was holding his head up, the good and faithful lad of Hampshire*\r\nwas blubbering over his master, whom he found and had thought dead, and\r\na surgeon was probing a wound in the shoulder, which he must have got\r\nat the same moment when his horse was shot and fell over him. The battle\r\nwas over at this end of the field, by this time: the village was in\r\npossession of the English, its brave defenders prisoners, or fled,\r\nor drowned, many of them, in the neighboring waters of Donau. But for\r\nhonest Lockwood's faithful search after his master, there had no doubt\r\nbeen an end of Esmond here, and of this his story. The marauders were\r\nout riffling the bodies as they lay on the field, and Jack had brained\r\none of these gentry with the club-end of his musket, who had eased\r\nEsmond of his hat and periwig, his purse, and fine silver-mounted\r\npistols which the Dowager gave him, and was fumbling in his pockets\r\nfor further treasure, when Jack Lockwood came up and put an end to the\r\nscoundrel's triumph.\r\n\r\n     * My mistress, before I went this campaign, sent me John\r\n     Lockwood out of Walcote, who hath ever since remained with\r\n     me.--H. E.\r\n\r\nHospitals for our wounded were established at Blenheim, and here for\r\nseveral weeks Esmond lay in very great danger of his life; the wound\r\nwas not very great from which he suffered, and the ball extracted by the\r\nsurgeon on the spot where our young gentleman received it; but a fever\r\nset in next day, as he was lying in hospital, and that almost carried\r\nhim away. Jack Lockwood said he talked in the wildest manner during his\r\ndelirium; that he called himself the Marquis of Esmond, and seizing one\r\nof the surgeon's assistants who came to dress his wounds, swore that he\r\nwas Madam Beatrix, and that he would make her a duchess if she would\r\nbut say yes. He was passing the days in these crazy fancies, and vana\r\nsomnia, whilst the army was singing \xe2\x80\x9cTe Deum\xe2\x80\x9d for the victory, and\r\nthose famous festivities were taking place at which our Duke, now made a\r\nPrince of the Empire, was entertained by the King of the Romans and his\r\nnobility. His Grace went home by Berlin and Hanover, and Esmond lost\r\nthe festivities which took place at those cities, and which his general\r\nshared in company of the other general officers who travelled with our\r\ngreat captain. When he could move, it was by the Duke of Wurtemberg's\r\ncity of Stuttgard that he made his way homewards, revisiting Heidelberg\r\nagain, whence he went to Manheim, and hence had a tedious but easy water\r\njourney down the river of Rhine, which he had thought a delightful and\r\nbeautiful voyage indeed, but that his heart was longing for home, and\r\nsomething far more beautiful and delightful.\r\n\r\nAs bright and welcome as the eyes almost of his mistress shone the\r\nlights of Harwich, as the packet came in from Holland. It was not\r\nmany hours ere he, Esmond, was in London, of that you may be sure, and\r\nreceived with open arms by the old Dowager of Chelsey, who vowed, in her\r\njargon of French and English, that he had the air noble, that his pallor\r\nembellished him, that he was an Amadis and deserved a Gloriana; and oh!\r\nflames and darts! what was his joy at hearing that his mistress was come\r\ninto waiting, and was now with her Majesty at Kensington! Although Mr.\r\nEsmond had told Jack Lockwood to get horses and they would ride for\r\nWinchester that night, when he heard this news he countermanded the\r\nhorses at once; his business lay no longer in Hants; all his hope and\r\ndesire lay within a couple of miles of him in Kensington Park wall. Poor\r\nHarry had never looked in the glass before so eagerly to see whether he\r\nhad the bel air, and his paleness really did become him; he never\r\ntook such pains about the curl of his periwig, and the taste of his\r\nembroidery and point-lace, as now, before Mr. Amadis presented himself\r\nto Madam Gloriana. Was the fire of the French lines half so murderous\r\nas the killing glances from her ladyship's eyes? Oh! darts and raptures,\r\nhow beautiful were they!\r\n\r\nAnd as, before the blazing sun of morning, the moon fades away in the\r\nsky almost invisible, Esmond thought, with a blush perhaps, of another\r\nsweet pale face, sad and faint, and fading out of sight, with its sweet\r\nfond gaze of affection; such a last look it seemed to cast as Eurydice\r\nmight have given, yearning after her lover, when Fate and Pluto summoned\r\nher, and she passed away into the shades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAN OLD STORY ABOUT A FOOL AND A WOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny taste for pleasure which Esmond had (and he liked to desipere in\r\nloco, neither more nor less than most young men of his age) he could\r\nnow gratify to the utmost extent, and in the best company which the town\r\nafforded. When the army went into winter quarters abroad, those of the\r\nofficers who had interest or money easily got leave of absence, and\r\nfound it much pleasanter to spend their time in Pall Mall and Hyde Park,\r\nthan to pass the winter away behind the fortifications of the dreary\r\nold Flanders towns, where the English troops were gathered. Yachts and\r\npackets passed daily between the Dutch and Flemish ports and Harwich;\r\nthe roads thence to London and the great inns were crowded with\r\narmy gentlemen; the taverns and ordinaries of the town swarmed with\r\nred-coats; and our great Duke's levees at St. James's were as thronged\r\nas they had been at Ghent and Brussels, where we treated him, and he us,\r\nwith the grandeur and ceremony of a sovereign. Though Esmond had been\r\nappointed to a lieutenancy in the Fusileer regiment, of which that\r\ncelebrated officer, Brigadier John Richmond Webb, was colonel, he\r\nhad never joined the regiment, nor been introduced to its excellent\r\ncommander, though they had made the same campaign together, and been\r\nengaged in the same battle. But being aide-de-camp to General Lumley,\r\nwho commanded the division of horse, and the army marching to its point\r\nof destination on the Danube by different routes, Esmond had not fallen\r\nin, as yet, with his commander and future comrades of the fort; and it\r\nwas in London, in Golden Square, where Major-General Webb lodged, that\r\nCaptain Esmond had the honor of first paying his respects to his friend,\r\npatron, and commander of after days.\r\n\r\nThose who remember this brilliant and accomplished gentleman may\r\nrecollect his character, upon which he prided himself, I think, not a\r\nlittle, of being the handsomest man in the army; a poet who writ a\r\ndull copy of verses upon the battle of Oudenarde three years after,\r\ndescribing Webb, says:--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cTo noble danger Webb conducts the way,\r\n     His great example all his troops obey;\r\n     Before the front the general sternly rides,\r\n     With such an air as Mars to battle strides:\r\n     Propitious heaven must sure a hero save,\r\n     Like Paris handsome, and like Hector brave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Webb thought these verses quite as fine as Mr. Addison's on the\r\nBlenheim Campaign, and, indeed, to be Hector a la mode de Paris, was\r\npart of this gallant gentleman's ambition. It would have been difficult\r\nto find an officer in the whole army, or amongst the splendid courtiers\r\nand cavaliers of the Maison du Roy, that fought under Vendosme and\r\nVilleroy in the army opposed to ours, who was a more accomplished\r\nsoldier and perfect gentleman, and either braver or better-looking.\r\nAnd if Mr. Webb believed of himself what the world said of him, and was\r\ndeeply convinced of his own indisputable genius, beauty, and valor, who\r\nhas a right to quarrel with him very much? This self-content of his kept\r\nhim in general good-humor, of which his friends and dependants got the\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nHe came of a very ancient Wiltshire family, which he respected above all\r\nfamilies in the world: he could prove a lineal descent from King Edward\r\nthe First, and his first ancestor, Roaldus de Richmond, rode by William\r\nthe Conqueror's side on Hastings field. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were gentlemen, Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nused to say, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the Churchills were horse-boys.\xe2\x80\x9d He was a very\r\ntall man, standing in his pumps six feet three inches (in his great\r\njack-boots, with his tall fair periwig, and hat and feather, he could\r\nnot have been less than eight feet high). \xe2\x80\x9cI am taller than Churchill,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he would say, surveying himself in the glass, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am a better made\r\nman; and if the women won't like a man that hasn't a wart on his nose,\r\nfaith, I can't help myself, and Churchill has the better of me there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Indeed, he was always measuring himself with the Duke, and always asking\r\nhis friends to measure them. And talking in this frank way, as he would\r\ndo, over his cups, wags would laugh and encourage him; friends would\r\nbe sorry for him; schemers and flatterers would egg him on, and\r\ntale-bearers carry the stories to headquarters, and widen the difference\r\nwhich already existed there, between the great captain and one of the\r\nablest and bravest lieutenants he ever had.\r\n\r\nHis rancor against the Duke was so apparent, that one saw it in the\r\nfirst half-hour's conversation with General Webb; and his lady, who\r\nadored her General, and thought him a hundred times taller, handsomer,\r\nand braver than a prodigal nature had made him, hated the great Duke\r\nwith such an intensity as it becomes faithful wives to feel against\r\ntheir husbands' enemies. Not that my Lord Duke was so yet; Mr. Webb had\r\nsaid a thousand things against him, which his superior had pardoned; and\r\nhis Grace, whose spies were everywhere, had heard a thousand things more\r\nthat Webb had never said. But it cost this great man no pains to pardon;\r\nand he passed over an injury or a benefit alike easily.\r\n\r\nShould any child of mine take the pains to read these his ancestor's\r\nmemoirs, I would not have him judge of the great Duke* by what a\r\ncontemporary has written of him. No man hath been so immensely lauded\r\nand decried as this great statesman and warrior; as, indeed, no man ever\r\ndeserved better the very greatest praise and the strongest censure. If\r\nthe present writer joins with the latter faction, very likely a private\r\npique of his own may be the cause of his ill-feeling.\r\n\r\n     * This passage in the Memoirs of Esmond is written on a leaf\r\n     inserted into the MS. book, and dated 1744, probably after\r\n     he had heard of the Duchess's death.\r\n\r\nOn presenting himself at the Commander-in-Chief's levee, his Grace had\r\nnot the least remembrance of General Lumley's aide-de-camp, and though\r\nhe knew Esmond's family perfectly well, having served with both lords\r\n(my Lord Francis and the Viscount Esmond's father) in Flanders, and in\r\nthe Duke of York's Guard, the Duke of Marlborough, who was friendly\r\nand serviceable to the (so-styled) legitimate representatives of the\r\nViscount Castlewood, took no sort of notice of the poor lieutenant\r\nwho bore their name. A word of kindness or acknowledgment, or a single\r\nglance of approbation, might have changed Esmond's opinion of the great\r\nman; and instead of a satire, which his pen cannot help writing, who\r\nknows but that the humble historian might have taken the other side of\r\npanegyric? We have but to change the point of view, and the greatest\r\naction looks mean; as we turn the perspective-glass, and a giant appears\r\na pigmy. You may describe, but who can tell whether your sight is clear\r\nor not, or your means of information accurate? Had the great man said\r\nbut a word of kindness to the small one (as he would have stepped out\r\nof his gilt chariot to shake hands with Lazarus in rags and sores, if he\r\nthought Lazarus could have been of any service to him), no doubt Esmond\r\nwould have fought for him with pen and sword to the utmost of his might;\r\nbut my lord the lion did not want master mouse at this moment, and so\r\nMuscipulus went off and nibbled in opposition.\r\n\r\nSo it was, however, that a young gentleman, who, in the eyes of his\r\nfamily, and in his own, doubtless, was looked upon as a consummate hero,\r\nfound that the great hero of the day took no more notice of him than\r\nof the smallest drummer in his Grace's army. The Dowager at Chelsey was\r\nfurious against this neglect of her family, and had a great battle with\r\nLady Marlborough (as Lady Castlewood insisted on calling the Duchess).\r\nHer Grace was now Mistress of the Robes to her Majesty, and one of the\r\ngreatest personages in this kingdom, as her husband was in all Europe,\r\nand the battle between the two ladies took place in the Queen's\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess, in reply to my aunt's eager clamor, said haughtily, that\r\nshe had done her best for the legitimate branch of the Esmonds, and\r\ncould not be expected to provide for the bastard brats of the family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBastards!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Viscountess, in a fury. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are bastards among\r\nthe Churchills, as your Grace knows, and the Duke of Berwick is provided\r\nfor well enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Duchess, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know whose fault it is that there are\r\nno such dukes in the Esmond family too, and how that little scheme of a\r\ncertain lady miscarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond's friend, Dick Steele, who was in waiting on the Prince, heard\r\nthe controversy between the ladies at court. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd faith,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dick, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink, Harry, thy kinswoman had the worst of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not keep the story quiet; 'twas all over the coffee-houses ere\r\nnight; it was printed in a News Letter before a month was over, and \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nreply of her Grace the Duchess of M-rlb-r-gh to a Popish Lady of the\r\nCourt, once a favorite of the late K--- J-m-s,\xe2\x80\x9d was printed in half a\r\ndozen places, with a note stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthis duchess, when the head\r\nof this lady's family came by his death lately in a fatal duel, never\r\nrested until she got a pension for the orphan heir, and widow, from her\r\nMajesty's bounty.\xe2\x80\x9d The squabble did not advance poor Esmond's promotion\r\nmuch, and indeed made him so ashamed of himself that he dared not show\r\nhis face at the Commander-in-Chief's levees again.\r\n\r\nDuring those eighteen months which had passed since Esmond saw his dear\r\nmistress, her good father, the old Dean, quitted this life, firm in his\r\nprinciples to the very last, and enjoining his family always to remember\r\nthat the Queen's brother, King James the Third, was their rightful\r\nsovereign. He made a very edifying end, as his daughter told Esmond, and\r\nnot a little to her surprise, after his death (for he had lived always\r\nvery poorly) my lady found that her father had left no less a sum than\r\n3,000L. behind him, which he bequeathed to her.\r\n\r\nWith this little fortune Lady Castlewood was enabled, when her\r\ndaughter's turn at Court came, to come to London, where she took a small\r\ngenteel house at Kensington, in the neighborhood of the Court, bringing\r\nher children with her, and here it was that Esmond found his friends.\r\n\r\nAs for the young lord, his university career had ended rather abruptly.\r\nHonest Tusher, his governor, had found my young gentleman quite\r\nungovernable. My lord worried his life away with tricks; and broke out,\r\nas home-bred lads will, into a hundred youthful extravagances, so that\r\nDr. Bentley, the new master of Trinity, thought fit to write to the\r\nViscountess Castlewood, my lord's mother, and beg her to remove the\r\nyoung nobleman from a college where he declined to learn, and where he\r\nonly did harm by his riotous example. Indeed, I believe he nearly set\r\nfire to Nevil's Court, that beautiful new quadrangle of our college,\r\nwhich Sir Christopher Wren had lately built. He knocked down a\r\nproctor's man that wanted to arrest him in a midnight prank; he gave\r\na dinner-party on the Prince of Wales's birthday, which was within\r\na fortnight of his own, and the twenty young gentlemen then present\r\nsallied out after their wine, having toasted King James's health with\r\nopen windows, and sung cavalier songs, and shouted \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the\r\nKing!\xe2\x80\x9d in the great court, so that the master came out of his lodge at\r\nmidnight, and dissipated the riotous assembly.\r\n\r\nThis was my lord's crowning freak, and the Rev. Thomas Tusher, domestic\r\nchaplain to the Right Honorable the Lord Viscount Castlewood, finding\r\nhis prayers and sermons of no earthly avail to his lordship, gave up his\r\nduties of governor; went and married his brewer's widow at Southampton,\r\nand took her and her money to his parsonage house at Castlewood.\r\n\r\nMy lady could not be angry with her son for drinking King James's\r\nhealth, being herself a loyal Tory, as all the Castlewood family were,\r\nand acquiesced with a sigh, knowing, perhaps, that her refusal would be\r\nof no avail to the young lord's desire for a military life. She would\r\nhave liked him to be in Mr. Esmond's regiment, hoping that Harry might\r\nact as a guardian and adviser to his wayward young kinsman; but my young\r\nlord would hear of nothing but the Guards, and a commission was got for\r\nhim in the Duke of Ormond's regiment; so Esmond found my lord, ensign\r\nand lieutenant, when he returned from Germany after the Blenheim\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced by both Lady Castlewood's children when they\r\nappeared in public was extraordinary, and the whole town speedily rang\r\nwith their fame: such a beautiful couple, it was declared, never had\r\nbeen seen; the young maid of honor was toasted at every table and\r\ntavern, and as for my young lord, his good looks were even more admired\r\nthan his sister's. A hundred songs were written about the pair, and\r\nas the fashion of that day was, my young lord was praised in these\r\nAnacreontics as warmly as Bathyllus. You may be sure that he accepted\r\nvery complacently the town's opinion of him, and acquiesced with that\r\nfrankness and charming good-humor he always showed in the idea that he\r\nwas the prettiest fellow in all London.\r\n\r\nThe old Dowager at Chelsey, though she could never be got to acknowledge\r\nthat Mistress Beatrix was any beauty at all, (in which opinion, as it\r\nmay be imagined, a vast number of the ladies agreed with her), yet, on\r\nthe very first sight of young Castlewood, she owned she fell in love\r\nwith him: and Henry Esmond, on his return to Chelsey, found himself\r\nquite superseded in her favor by her younger kinsman. The feat of\r\ndrinking the King's health at Cambridge would have won her heart, she\r\nsaid, if nothing else did. \xe2\x80\x9cHow had the dear young fellow got such\r\nbeauty?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNot from his father--certainly not from his mother.\r\nHow had he come by such noble manners, and the perfect bel air? That\r\ncountrified Walcote widow could never have taught him.\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond had his\r\nown opinion about the countrified Walcote widow, who had a quiet grace\r\nand serene kindness, that had always seemed to him the perfection of\r\ngood breeding, though he did not try to argue this point with his aunt.\r\nBut he could agree in most of the praises which the enraptured old\r\ndowager bestowed on my Lord Viscount, than whom he never beheld a more\r\nfascinating and charming gentleman. Castlewood had not wit so much as\r\nenjoyment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lad looks good things,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Steele used to say; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhis laugh lights up a conversation as much as ten repartees from\r\nMr. Congreve. I would as soon sit over a bottle with him as with Mr.\r\nAddison; and rather listen to his talk than hear Nicolini. Was ever\r\nman so gracefully drunk as my Lord Castlewood? I would give anything to\r\ncarry my wine\xe2\x80\x9d (though, indeed, Dick bore his very kindly, and plenty\r\nof it, too), \xe2\x80\x9clike this incomparable young man. When he is sober he is\r\ndelightful; and when tipsy, perfectly irresistible.\xe2\x80\x9d And referring to\r\nhis favorite, Shakspeare (who was quite out of fashion until Steele\r\nbrought him back into the mode), Dick compared Lord Castlewood to Prince\r\nHal, and was pleased to dub Esmond as ancient Pistol.\r\n\r\nThe Mistress of the Robes, the greatest lady in England after the Queen,\r\nor even before her Majesty, as the world said, though she never could be\r\ngot to say a civil word to Beatrix, whom she had promoted to her place\r\nas maid of honor, took her brother into instant favor. When young\r\nCastlewood, in his new uniform, and looking like a prince out of a fairy\r\ntale, went to pay his duty to her Grace, she looked at him for a minute\r\nin silence, the young man blushing and in confusion before her, then\r\nfairly burst out a-crying, and kissed him before her daughters and\r\ncompany. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was my boy's friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, through her sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nBlandford might have been like him.\xe2\x80\x9d And everybody saw, after this mark\r\nof the Duchess's favor, that my young lord's promotion was secure, and\r\npeople crowded round the favorite's favorite, who became vainer and\r\ngayer, and more good-humored than ever.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Madam Beatrix was making her conquests on her own side, and\r\namongst them was one poor gentleman, who had been shot by her young eyes\r\ntwo years before, and had never been quite cured of that wound; he knew,\r\nto be sure, how hopeless any passion might be, directed in that quarter,\r\nand had taken that best, though ignoble, remedium amoris, a speedy\r\nretreat from before the charmer, and a long absence from her; and not\r\nbeing dangerously smitten in the first instance, Esmond pretty soon got\r\nthe better of his complaint, and if he had it still, did not know he had\r\nit, and bore it easily. But when he returned after Blenheim, the young\r\nlady of sixteen, who had appeared the most beautiful object his eyes had\r\never looked on two years back, was now advanced to a perfect ripeness\r\nand perfection of beauty, such as instantly enthralled the poor devil,\r\nwho had already been a fugitive from her charms. Then he had seen her\r\nbut for two days, and fled; now he beheld her day after day, and when\r\nshe was at Court watched after her; when she was at home, made one of\r\nthe family party; when she went abroad, rode after her mother's chariot;\r\nwhen she appeared in public places, was in the box near her, or in the\r\npit looking at her; when she went to church was sure to be there, though\r\nhe might not listen to the sermon, and be ready to hand her to her chair\r\nif she deigned to accept of his services, and select him from a score of\r\nyoung men who were always hanging round about her. When she went away,\r\naccompanying her Majesty to Hampton Court, a darkness fell over London.\r\nGods, what nights has Esmond passed, thinking of her, rhyming about her,\r\ntalking about her! His friend Dick Steele was at this time courting\r\nthe young lady, Mrs. Scurlock, whom he married; she had a lodging in\r\nKensington Square, hard by my Lady Castlewood's house there. Dick and\r\nHarry, being on the same errand, used to meet constantly at Kensington.\r\nThey were always prowling about that place, or dismally walking thence,\r\nor eagerly running thither. They emptied scores of bottles at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKing's Arms,\xe2\x80\x9d each man prating of his love, and allowing the other to\r\ntalk on condition that he might have his own turn as a listener. Hence\r\narose an intimacy between them, though to all the rest of their friends\r\nthey must have been insufferable. Esmond's verses to \xe2\x80\x9cGloriana at the\r\nHarpsichord,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cGloriana's Nosegay,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cGloriana at Court,\xe2\x80\x9d appeared\r\nthis year in the Observator.--Have you never read them? They were\r\nthought pretty poems, and attributed by some to Mr. Prior.\r\n\r\nThis passion did not escape--how should it?--the clear eyes of Esmond's\r\nmistress: he told her all; what will a man not do when frantic with\r\nlove? To what baseness will he not demean himself? What pangs will he\r\nnot make others suffer, so that he may ease his selfish heart of a part\r\nof its own pain? Day after day he would seek his dear mistress, pour\r\ninsane hopes, supplications, rhapsodies, raptures, into her ear. She\r\nlistened, smiled, consoled, with untiring pity and sweetness. Esmond was\r\nthe eldest of her children, so she was pleased to say; and as for her\r\nkindness, who ever had or would look for aught else from one who was\r\nan angel of goodness and pity? After what has been said, 'tis needless\r\nalmost to add that poor Esmond's suit was unsuccessful. What was a\r\nnameless, penniless lieutenant to do, when some of the greatest in\r\nthe land were in the field? Esmond never so much as thought of asking\r\npermission to hope so far above his reach as he knew this prize was\r\nand passed his foolish, useless life in mere abject sighs and impotent\r\nlonging. What nights of rage, what days of torment, of passionate\r\nunfulfilled desire, of sickening jealousy can he recall! Beatrix\r\nthought no more of him than of the lackey that followed her chair. His\r\ncomplaints did not touch her in the least; his raptures rather fatigued\r\nher; she cared for his verses no more than for Dan Chaucer's, who's\r\ndead these ever so many hundred years; she did not hate him; she rather\r\ndespised him, and just suffered him.\r\n\r\nOne day, after talking to Beatrix's mother, his dear, fond, constant\r\nmistress--for hours--for all day long--pouring out his flame and his\r\npassion, his despair and rage, returning again and again to the theme,\r\npacing the room, tearing up the flowers on the table, twisting and\r\nbreaking into bits the wax out of the stand-dish, and performing a\r\nhundred mad freaks of passionate folly; seeing his mistress at last\r\nquite pale and tired out with sheer weariness of compassion, and\r\nwatching over his fever for the hundredth time, Esmond seized up his\r\nhat, and took his leave. As he got into Kensington Square, a sense of\r\nremorse came over him for the wearisome pain he had been inflicting upon\r\nthe dearest and kindest friend ever man had. He went back to the house,\r\nwhere the servant still stood at the open door, ran up the stairs, and\r\nfound his mistress where he had left her in the embrasure of the window,\r\nlooking over the fields towards Chelsey. She laughed, wiping away at the\r\nsame time the tears which were in her kind eyes; he flung himself down\r\non his knees, and buried his head in her lap. She had in her hand the\r\nstalk of one of the flowers, a pink, that he had torn to pieces. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\npardon me, pardon me, my dearest and kindest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI am in hell,\r\nand you are the angel that brings me a drop of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am your mother, you are my son, and I love you always,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nholding her hands over him: and he went away comforted and humbled in\r\nmind, as he thought of that amazing and constant love and tenderness\r\nwith which this sweet lady ever blessed and pursued him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMOUS MR. JOSEPH ADDISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen ushers had a table at Kensington, and the Guard a very\r\nsplendid dinner daily at St. James's, at either of which ordinaries\r\nEsmond was free to dine. Dick Steele liked the Guard-table better than\r\nhis own at the gentlemen ushers', where there was less wine and more\r\nceremony; and Esmond had many a jolly afternoon in company of his\r\nfriend, and a hundred times at least saw Dick into his chair. If there\r\nis verity in wine, according to the old adage, what an amiable-natured\r\ncharacter Dick's must have been! In proportion as he took in wine he\r\noverflowed with kindness. His talk was not witty so much as charming.\r\nHe never said a word that could anger anybody, and only became the more\r\nbenevolent the more tipsy he grew. Many of the wags derided the poor\r\nfellow in his cups, and chose him as a butt for their satire: but there\r\nwas a kindness about him, and a sweet playful fancy, that seemed to\r\nEsmond far more charming than the pointed talk of the brightest wits,\r\nwith their elaborate repartees and affected severities. I think\r\nSteele shone rather than sparkled. Those famous beaux-esprits of the\r\ncoffee-houses (Mr. William Congreve, for instance, when his gout and\r\nhis grandeur permitted him to come among us) would make many brilliant\r\nhits--half a dozen in a night sometimes--but, like sharp-shooters, when\r\nthey had fired their shot, they were obliged to retire under cover till\r\ntheir pieces were loaded again, and wait till they got another chance at\r\ntheir enemy; whereas Dick never thought that his bottle companion was a\r\nbutt to aim at--only a friend to shake by the hand. The poor fellow had\r\nhalf the town in his confidence; everybody knew everything about his\r\nloves and his debts, his creditors or his mistress's obduracy. When\r\nEsmond first came on to the town, honest Dick was all flames and\r\nraptures for a young lady, a West India fortune, whom he married. In a\r\ncouple of years the lady was dead, the fortune was all but spent, and\r\nthe honest widower was as eager in pursuit of a new paragon of beauty,\r\nas if he had never courted and married and buried the last one.\r\n\r\nQuitting the Guard-table one Sunday afternoon, when by chance Dick had a\r\nsober fit upon him, he and his friend were making their way down Germain\r\nStreet, and Dick all of a sudden left his companion's arm, and ran after\r\na gentleman who was poring over a folio volume at the book-shop near to\r\nSt. James's Church. He was a fair, tall man, in a snuff-colored suit,\r\nwith a plain sword, very sober, and almost shabby in appearance--at\r\nleast when compared to Captain Steele, who loved to adorn his jolly\r\nround person with the finest of clothes, and shone in scarlet and gold\r\nlace. The Captain rushed up, then, to the student of the book-stall,\r\ntook him in his arms, hugged him, and would have kissed him--for Dick\r\nwas always hugging and bussing his friends--but the other stepped\r\nback with a flush on his pale face, seeming to decline this public\r\nmanifestation of Steele's regard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Joe, where hast thou hidden thyself this age?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the\r\nCaptain, still holding both his friend's hands; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been languishing\r\nfor thee this fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fortnight is not an age, Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, very good-humoredly.\r\n(He had light blue eyes, extraordinary bright, and a face perfectly\r\nregular and handsome, like a tinted statue.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have been hiding\r\nmyself--where do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! not across the water, my dear Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d says Steele, with a look of\r\ngreat alarm: \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest I have always--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says his friend, interrupting him with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not come\r\nto such straits as that, Dick. I have been hiding, sir, at a place where\r\npeople never think of finding you--at my own lodgings, whither I am\r\ngoing to smoke a pipe now and drink a glass of sack: will your honor\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry Esmond, come hither,\xe2\x80\x9d cries out Dick. \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast heard me talk\r\nover and over again of my dearest Joe, my guardian angel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond, with a bow, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not from you only that I\r\nhave learnt to admire Mr. Addison. We loved good poetry at Cambridge as\r\nwell as at Oxford; and I have some of yours by heart, though I have put\r\non a red coat. . . . 'O qui canoro blandius Orpheo vocale ducis carmen;'\r\nshall I go on, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond, who, indeed, had read and loved\r\nthe charming Latin poems of Mr. Addison, as every scholar of that time\r\nknew and admired them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Captain Esmond who was at Blenheim,\xe2\x80\x9d says Steele.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, with a low bow, \xe2\x80\x9cat Mr. Addison's\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Addison, with a smile; as, indeed,\r\neverybody about town had heard that unlucky story about Esmond's dowager\r\naunt and the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were going to the 'George' to take a bottle before the play,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nSteele: \xe2\x80\x9cwilt thou be one, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Addison said his own lodgings were hard by, where he was still rich\r\nenough to give a good bottle of wine to his friends; and invited the\r\ntwo gentlemen to his apartment in the Haymarket, whither we accordingly\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall get credit with my landlady,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she\r\nsees two such fine gentlemen as you come up my stair.\xe2\x80\x9d And he politely\r\nmade his visitors welcome to his apartment, which was indeed but a\r\nshabby one, though no grandee of the land could receive his guests with\r\na more perfect and courtly grace than this gentleman. A frugal dinner,\r\nconsisting of a slice of meat and a penny loaf, was awaiting the owner\r\nof the lodgings. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wine is better than my meat,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Addison;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy Lord Halifax sent me the Burgundy.\xe2\x80\x9d And he set a bottle and glasses\r\nbefore his friends, and ate his simple dinner in a very few minutes,\r\nafter which the three fell to, and began to drink. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr.\r\nAddison, pointing to his writing-table, whereon was a map of the action\r\nat Hochstedt, and several other gazettes and pamphlets relating to the\r\nbattle, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I, too, am busy about your affairs, Captain. I am engaged\r\nas a poetical gazetteer, to say truth, and am writing a poem on the\r\ncampaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Esmond, at the request of his host, told him what he knew about the\r\nfamous battle, drew the river on the table aliquo mero, and with the aid\r\nof some bits of tobacco-pipe showed the advance of the left wing, where\r\nhe had been engaged.\r\n\r\nA sheet or two of the verses lay already on the table beside our bottles\r\nand glasses, and Dick having plentifully refreshed himself from the\r\nlatter, took up the pages of manuscript, writ out with scarce a blot or\r\ncorrection, in the author's slim, neat handwriting, and began to read\r\ntherefrom with great emphasis and volubility. At pauses of the verse,\r\nthe enthusiastic reader stopped and fired off a great salvo of applause.\r\n\r\nEsmond smiled at the enthusiasm of Addison's friend. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are like the\r\nGerman Burghers,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cand the Princes on the Mozelle: when our\r\narmy came to a halt, they always sent a deputation to compliment the\r\nchief, and fired a salute with all their artillery from their walls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd drunk the great chiefs health afterward, did not they?\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nCaptain Steele, gayly filling up a bumper;--he never was tardy at that\r\nsort of acknowledgment of a friend's merit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Duke, since you will have me act his Grace's part,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr.\r\nAddison, with a smile, and something of a blush, \xe2\x80\x9cpledged his friends in\r\nreturn. Most Serene Elector of Covent Garden, I drink to your Highness's\r\nhealth,\xe2\x80\x9d and he filled himself a glass. Joseph required scarce more\r\npressing than Dick to that sort of amusement; but the wine never seemed\r\nat all to fluster Mr. Addison's brains; it only unloosed his tongue:\r\nwhereas Captain Steele's head and speech were quite overcome by a single\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\nNo matter what the verses were, and, to say truth, Mr. Esmond found some\r\nof them more than indifferent, Dick's enthusiasm for his chief\r\nnever faltered, and in every line from Addison's pen, Steele found\r\na master-stroke. By the time Dick had come to that part of the poem,\r\nwherein the bard describes as blandly as though he were recording\r\na dance at the opera, or a harmless bout of bucolic cudgelling at a\r\nvillage fair, that bloody and ruthless part of our campaign, with the\r\nremembrance whereof every soldier who bore a part in it must sicken\r\nwith shame--when we were ordered to ravage and lay waste the Elector's\r\ncountry; and with fire and murder, slaughter and crime, a great part of\r\nhis dominions was overrun; when Dick came to the lines--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn vengeance roused the soldier fills his hand\r\n     With sword and fire, and ravages the land,\r\n     In crackling flames a thousand harvests burn,\r\n     A thousand villages to ashes turn.\r\n     To the thick woods the woolly flocks retreat,\r\n     And mixed with bellowing herds confusedly bleat.\r\n     Their trembling lords the common shade partake,\r\n     And cries of infants found in every brake.\r\n     The listening soldier fixed in sorrow stands,\r\n     Loth to obey his leader's just commands.\r\n     The leader grieves, by generous pity swayed,\r\n     To see his just commands so well obeyed;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nby this time wine and friendship had brought poor Dick to a perfectly\r\nmaudlin state, and he hiccupped out the last line with a tenderness that\r\nset one of his auditors a-laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admire the license of your poets,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond to Mr. Addison. (Dick,\r\nafter reading of the verses, was fain to go off, insisting on kissing\r\nhis two dear friends before his departure, and reeling away with his\r\nperiwig over his eyes.) \xe2\x80\x9cI admire your art: the murder of the campaign\r\nis done to military music, like a battle at the opera, and the virgins\r\nshriek in harmony, as our victorious grenadiers march into their\r\nvillages. Do you know what a scene it was?\xe2\x80\x9d--(by this time, perhaps,\r\nthe wine had warmed Mr. Esmond's head too,)--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat a triumph you are\r\ncelebrating? what scenes of shame and horror were enacted, over which\r\nthe commander's genius presided, as calm as though he didn't belong to\r\nour sphere? You talk of the 'listening soldier fixed in sorrow,' the\r\n'leader's grief swayed by generous pity;' to my belief the leader cared\r\nno more for bleating flocks than he did for infants' cries, and many\r\nof our ruffians butchered one or the other with equal alacrity. I was\r\nashamed of my trade when I saw those horrors perpetrated, which came\r\nunder every man's eyes. You hew out of your polished verses a stately\r\nimage of smiling victory; I tell you 'tis an uncouth, distorted, savage\r\nidol; hideous, bloody, and barbarous. The rites performed before it are\r\nshocking to think of. You great poets should show it as it is--ugly and\r\nhorrible, not beautiful and serene. Oh, sir, had you made the campaign,\r\nbelieve me, you never would have sung it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this little outbreak, Mr. Addison was listening, smoking out of\r\nhis long pipe, and smiling very placidly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have?\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nhe. \xe2\x80\x9cIn our polished days, and according to the rules of art, 'tis\r\nimpossible that the Muse should depict tortures or begrime her hands\r\nwith the horrors of war. These are indicated rather than described; as\r\nin the Greek tragedies, that, I dare say, you have read (and sure there\r\ncan be no more elegant specimens of composition), Agamemnon is slain, or\r\nMedea's children destroyed, away from the scene;--the chorus occupying\r\nthe stage and singing of the action to pathetic music. Something of this\r\nI attempt, my dear sir, in my humble way: 'tis a panegyric I mean to\r\nwrite, and not a satire. Were I to sing as you would have me, the town\r\nwould tear the poet in pieces, and burn his book by the hands of the\r\ncommon hangman. Do you not use tobacco? Of all the weeds grown on earth,\r\nsure the nicotian is the most soothing and salutary. We must paint our\r\ngreat Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Addison went on, \xe2\x80\x9cnot as a man, which no doubt he is,\r\nwith weaknesses like the rest of us, but as a hero. 'Tis in a triumph,\r\nnot a battle, that your humble servant is riding his sleek Pegasus. We\r\ncollege poets trot, you know, on very easy nags; it hath been, time\r\nout of mind, part of the poet's profession to celebrate the actions of\r\nheroes in verse, and to sing the deeds which you men of war perform. I\r\nmust follow the rules of my art, and the composition of such a strain\r\nas this must be harmonious and majestic, not familiar, or too near\r\nthe vulgar truth. Si parva licet: if Virgil could invoke the divine\r\nAugustus, a humbler poet from the banks of the Isis may celebrate a\r\nvictory and a conqueror of our own nation, in whose triumphs every\r\nBriton has a share, and whose glory and genius contributes to every\r\ncitizen's individual honor. When hath there been, since our Henrys' and\r\nEdwards' days, such a great feat of arms as that from which you yourself\r\nhave brought away marks of distinction? If 'tis in my power to sing that\r\nsong worthily, I will do so, and be thankful to my Muse. If I fail as a\r\npoet, as a Briton at least I will show my loyalty, and fling up my cap\r\nand huzzah for the conqueror:--\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9c'Rheni pacator et Istri\r\n     Omnis in hoc uno variis discordia cessit\r\n     Ordinibus; laetatur eques, plauditque senator,\r\n     Votaque patricio certant plebeia favori.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were as brave men on that field,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond (who never\r\ncould be made to love the Duke of Marlborough, nor to forget those\r\nstories which he used to hear in his youth regarding that great chiefs\r\nselfishness and treachery)--\xe2\x80\x9cthere were men at Blenheim as good as the\r\nleader, whom neither knights nor senators applauded, nor voices plebeian\r\nor patrician favored, and who lie there forgotten, under the clods. What\r\npoet is there to sing them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sing the gallant souls of heroes sent to Hades!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Addison,\r\nwith a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you celebrate them all? If I may venture to\r\nquestion anything in such an admirable work, the catalogue of the ships\r\nin Homer hath always appeared to me as somewhat wearisome; what had the\r\npoem been, supposing the writer had chronicled the names of captains,\r\nlieutenants, rank and file? One of the greatest of a great man's\r\nqualities is success; 'tis the result of all the others; 'tis a latent\r\npower in him which compels the favor of the gods, and subjugates\r\nfortune. Of all his gifts I admire that one in the great Marlborough. To\r\nbe brave? every man is brave. But in being victorious, as he is, I fancy\r\nthere is something divine. In presence of the occasion, the great\r\nsoul of the leader shines out, and the god is confessed. Death itself\r\nrespects him, and passes by him to lay others low. War and carnage flee\r\nbefore him to ravage other parts of the field, as Hector from before the\r\ndivine Achilles. You say he hath no pity; no more have the gods, who are\r\nabove it, and superhuman. The fainting battle gathers strength at his\r\naspect; and, wherever he rides, victory charges with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA couple of days after, when Mr. Esmond revisited his poetic friend, he\r\nfound this thought, struck out in the fervor of conversation, improved\r\nand shaped into those famous lines, which are in truth the noblest in\r\nthe poem of the \xe2\x80\x9cCampaign.\xe2\x80\x9d As the two gentlemen sat engaged in talk,\r\nMr. Addison solacing himself with his customary pipe, the little\r\nmaid-servant that waited on his lodging came up, preceding a gentleman\r\nin fine laced clothes, that had evidently been figuring at Court or a\r\ngreat man's levee. The courtier coughed a little at the smoke of the\r\npipe, and looked round the room curiously, which was shabby enough, as\r\nwas the owner in his worn, snuff-colored suit and plain tie-wig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow goes on the magnum opus, Mr. Addison?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Court gentleman on\r\nlooking down at the papers that were on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were but now over it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Addison (the greatest courtier in the\r\nland could not have a more splendid politeness, or greater dignity of\r\nmanner). \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9con the table: hac ibat Simois,\r\nhere ran the little river Nebel: hic est Sigeia tellus, here are\r\nTallard's quarters, at the bowl of this pipe, at the attack of which\r\nCaptain Esmond was present. I have the honor to introduce him to Mr.\r\nBoyle; and Mr. Esmond was but now depicting aliquo proelia mixta mero,\r\nwhen you came in.\xe2\x80\x9d In truth, the two gentlemen had been so engaged when\r\nthe visitor arrived, and Addison, in his smiling way, speaking of Mr.\r\nWebb, colonel of Esmond's regiment (who commanded a brigade in the\r\naction, and greatly distinguished himself there), was lamenting that he\r\ncould find never a suitable rhyme for Webb, otherwise the brigade should\r\nhave had a place in the poet's verses. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for you, you are but a\r\nlieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d says Addison, \xe2\x80\x9cand the Muse can't occupy herself with any\r\ngentleman under the rank of a field officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle was all impatient to hear, saying that my Lord Treasurer\r\nand my Lord Halifax were equally anxious; and Addison, blushing, began\r\nreading of his verses, and, I suspect, knew their weak parts as well\r\nas the most critical hearer. When he came to the lines describing the\r\nangel, that\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cInspired repulsed battalions to engage,\r\n     And taught the doubtful battle where to rage,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nhe read with great animation, looking at Esmond, as much as to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know where that simile came from--from our talk, and our bottle of\r\nBurgundy, the other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poet's two hearers were caught with enthusiasm, and applauded the\r\nverses with all their might. The gentleman of the Court sprang up in\r\ngreat delight. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a word more, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust me with\r\nthe papers--I'll defend them with my life. Let me read them over to my\r\nLord Treasurer, whom I am appointed to see in half an hour. I venture to\r\npromise, the verses shall lose nothing by my reading, and then, sir, we\r\nshall see whether Lord Halifax has a right to complain that his friend's\r\npension is no longer paid.\xe2\x80\x9d And without more ado, the courtier in lace\r\nseized the manuscript pages, placed them in his breast with his ruffled\r\nhand over his heart, executed a most gracious wave of the hat with the\r\ndisengaged hand, and smiled and bowed out of the room, leaving an odor\r\nof pomander behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes not the chamber look quite dark?\xe2\x80\x9d says Addison, surveying it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cafter the glorious appearance and disappearance of that gracious\r\nmessenger? Why, he illuminated the whole room. Your scarlet, Mr. Esmond,\r\nwill bear any light; but this threadbare old coat of mine, how very worn\r\nit looked under the glare of that splendor! I wonder whether they will\r\ndo anything for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I came out of Oxford into the\r\nworld, my patrons promised me great things; and you see where their\r\npromises have landed me, in a lodging up two pair of stairs, with a\r\nsixpenny dinner from the cook's shop. Well, I suppose this promise will\r\ngo after the others, and fortune will jilt me, as the jade has been\r\ndoing any time these seven years. 'I puff the prostitute away,'\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nhe, smiling, and blowing a cloud out of his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no hardship\r\nin poverty, Esmond, that is not bearable; no hardship even in honest\r\ndependence that an honest man may not put up with. I came out of the lap\r\nof Alma Mater, puffed up with her praises of me, and thinking to make\r\na figure in the world with the parts and learning which had got me no\r\nsmall name in our college. The world is the ocean, and Isis and Charwell\r\nare but little drops, of which the sea takes no account. My reputation\r\nended a mile beyond Maudlin Tower; no one took note of me; and I learned\r\nthis at least, to bear up against evil fortune with a cheerful heart.\r\nFriend Dick hath made a figure in the world, and has passed me in the\r\nrace long ago. What matters a little name or a little fortune? There is\r\nno fortune that a philosopher cannot endure. I have been not unknown as\r\na scholar, and yet forced to live by turning bear-leader, and teaching\r\na boy to spell. What then? The life was not pleasant, but possible--the\r\nbear was bearable. Should this venture fail, I will go back to Oxford;\r\nand some day, when you are a general, you shall find me a curate in a\r\ncassock and bands, and I shall welcome your honor to my cottage in the\r\ncountry, and to a mug of penny ale. 'Tis not poverty that's the hardest\r\nto bear, or the least happy lot in life,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Addison, shaking the\r\nash out of his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, my pipe is smoked out. Shall we have another\r\nbottle? I have still a couple in the cupboard, and of the right sort. No\r\nmore?--let us go abroad and take a turn on the Mall, or look in at the\r\ntheatre and see Dick's comedy. 'Tis not a masterpiece of wit; but Dick\r\nis a good fellow, though he doth not set the Thames on fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithin a month after this day, Mr. Addison's ticket had come up a\r\nprodigious prize in the lottery of life. All the town was in an uproar\r\nof admiration of his poem, the \xe2\x80\x9cCampaign,\xe2\x80\x9d which Dick Steele was\r\nspouting at every coffee-house in Whitehall and Covent Garden. The wits\r\non the other side of Temple Bar saluted him at once as the greatest poet\r\nthe world had seen for ages; the people huzza'ed for Marlborough and\r\nfor Addison, and, more than this, the party in power provided for the\r\nmeritorious poet, and Addison got the appointment of Commissioner of\r\nExcise, which the famous Mr. Locke vacated, and rose from this place to\r\nother dignities and honors; his prosperity from henceforth to the end of\r\nhis life being scarce ever interrupted. But I doubt whether he was not\r\nhappier in his garret in the Haymarket, than ever he was in his splendid\r\npalace at Kensington; and I believe the fortune that came to him in the\r\nshape of the countess his wife was no better than a shrew and a vixen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGay as the town was, 'twas but a dreary place for Mr. Esmond, whether\r\nhis charmer was in or out of it, and he was glad when his general gave\r\nhim notice that he was going back to his division of the army which lay\r\nin winter-quarters at Bois-le-Duc. His dear mistress bade him\r\nfarewell with a cheerful face; her blessing he knew he had always, and\r\nwheresoever fate carried him. Mistress Beatrix was away in attendance on\r\nher Majesty at Hampton Court, and kissed her fair fingertips to him, by\r\nway of adieu, when he rode thither to take his leave. She received her\r\nkinsman in a waiting-room, where there were half a dozen more ladies of\r\nthe Court, so that his high-flown speeches, had he intended to make\r\nany (and very likely he did), were impossible; and she announced to her\r\nfriends that her cousin was going to the army, in as easy a manner as\r\nshe would have said he was going to a chocolate-house. He asked with\r\na rather rueful face, if she had any orders for the army? and she was\r\npleased to say that she would like a mantle of Mechlin lace. She made\r\nhim a saucy curtsy in reply to his own dismal bow. She deigned to kiss\r\nher fingertips from the window, where she stood laughing with the other\r\nladies, and chanced to see him as he made his way to the \xe2\x80\x9cToy.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nDowager at Chelsey was not sorry to part with him this time. \xe2\x80\x9cMon cher,\r\nvous etes triste comme un sermon,\xe2\x80\x9d she did him the honor to say to him;\r\nindeed, gentlemen in his condition are by no means amusing companions,\r\nand besides, the fickle old woman had now found a much more amiable\r\nfavorite, and raffoled for her darling lieutenant of the Guard. Frank\r\nremained behind for a while, and did not join the army till later, in\r\nthe suite of his Grace the Commander-in-Chief. His dear mother, on the\r\nlast day before Esmond went away, and when the three dined together,\r\nmade Esmond promise to befriend her boy, and besought Frank to take the\r\nexample of his kinsman as of a loyal gentleman and brave soldier, so\r\nshe was pleased to say; and at parting, betrayed not the least sign of\r\nfaltering or weakness, though, God knows, that fond heart was fearful\r\nenough when others were concerned, though so resolute in bearing its own\r\npain.\r\n\r\nEsmond's general embarked at Harwich. 'Twas a grand sight to see Mr.\r\nWebb dressed in scarlet on the deck, waving his hat as our yacht put\r\noff, and the guns saluted from the shore. Harry did not see his viscount\r\nagain, until three months after, at Bois-le-Duc, when his Grace the Duke\r\ncame to take the command, and Frank brought a budget of news from home:\r\nhow he had supped with this actress, and got tired of that; how he had\r\ngot the better of Mr. St. John, both over the bottle, and with Mrs.\r\nMountford, of the Haymarket Theatre (a veteran charmer of fifty, with\r\nwhom the young scapegrace chose to fancy himself in love); how his\r\nsister was always at her tricks, and had jilted a young baron for an\r\nold earl. \xe2\x80\x9cI can't make out Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cshe cares for none of\r\nus--she only thinks about herself; she is never happy unless she is\r\nquarrelling; but as for my mother--my mother, Harry, is an angel.\xe2\x80\x9d Harry\r\ntried to impress on the young fellow the necessity of doing everything\r\nin his power to please that angel; not to drink too much; not to go into\r\ndebt; not to run after the pretty Flemish girls, and so forth, as became\r\na senior speaking to a lad. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Lord bless thee!\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmay do what I like, and I know she will love me all the same;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nso, indeed, he did what he liked. Everybody spoiled him, and his grave\r\nkinsman as much as the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nI GET A COMPANY IN THE CAMPAIGN OF 1706.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Whit-Sunday, the famous 23rd of May, 1706, my young lord first came\r\nunder the fire of the enemy, whom we found posted in order of battle,\r\ntheir lines extending three miles or more, over the high ground behind\r\nthe little Gheet river, and having on his left the little village of\r\nAnderkirk or Autre-eglise, and on his right Ramillies, which has given\r\nits name to one of the most brilliant and disastrous days of battle that\r\nhistory ever hath recorded.\r\n\r\nOur Duke here once more met his old enemy of Blenheim, the Bavarian\r\nElector and the Marechal Villeroy, over whom the Prince of Savoy had\r\ngained the famous victory of Chiari. What Englishman or Frenchman doth\r\nnot know the issue of that day? Having chosen his own ground, having\r\na force superior to the English, and besides the excellent Spanish and\r\nBavarian troops, the whole Maison-du-Roy with him, the most splendid\r\nbody of horse in the world,--in an hour (and in spite of the prodigious\r\ngallantry of the French Royal Household, who charged through the centre\r\nof our line and broke it,) this magnificent army of Villeroy was utterly\r\nrouted by troops that had been marching for twelve hours, and by the\r\nintrepid skill of a commander, who did, indeed, seem in the presence of\r\nthe enemy to be the very Genius of Victory.\r\n\r\nI think it was more from conviction than policy, though that policy was\r\nsurely the most prudent in the world, that the great Duke always spoke\r\nof his victories with an extraordinary modesty, and as if it was not so\r\nmuch his own admirable genius and courage which achieved these amazing\r\nsuccesses, but as if he was a special and fatal instrument in the hands\r\nof Providence, that willed irresistibly the enemy's overthrow. Before\r\nhis actions he always had the church service read solemnly, and\r\nprofessed an undoubting belief that our Queen's arms were blessed and\r\nour victory sure. All the letters which he writ after his battles\r\nshow awe rather than exultation; and he attributes the glory of these\r\nachievements, about which I have heard mere petty officers and men\r\nbragging with a pardonable vainglory, in nowise to his own bravery or\r\nskill, but to the superintending protection of heaven, which he ever\r\nseemed to think was our especial ally. And our army got to believe so,\r\nand the enemy learnt to think so too; for we never entered into a battle\r\nwithout a perfect confidence that it was to end in a victory; nor did\r\nthe French, after the issue of Blenheim, and that astonishing triumph of\r\nRamillies, ever meet us without feeling that the game was lost before it\r\nwas begun to be played, and that our general's fortune was irresistible.\r\nHere, as at Blenheim, the Duke's charger was shot, and 'twas thought for\r\na moment he was dead. As he mounted another, Binfield, his master of the\r\nhorse, kneeling to hold his Grace's stirrup, had his head shot away by\r\na cannon-ball. A French gentleman of the Royal Household, that was a\r\nprisoner with us, told the writer that at the time of the charge of\r\nthe Household, when their horse and ours were mingled, an Irish officer\r\nrecognized the Prince-Duke, and calling out--\xe2\x80\x9cMarlborough, Marlborough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n fired his pistol at him a bout-portant, and that a score more carbines\r\nand pistols were discharged at him. Not one touched him: he rode through\r\nthe French Curiassiers sword-in-hand, and entirely unhurt, and calm and\r\nsmiling, rallied the German Horse, that was reeling before the enemy,\r\nbrought these and twenty squadrons of Orkney's back upon them, and\r\ndrove the French across the river, again leading the charge himself, and\r\ndefeating the only dangerous move the French made that day.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Webb commanded on the left of our line, and had his own\r\nregiment under the orders of their beloved colonel. Neither he nor they\r\nbelied their character for gallantry on this occasion; but it was about\r\nhis dear young lord that Esmond was anxious, never having sight of him\r\nsave once, in the whole course of the day, when he brought an order from\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief to Mr. Webb. When our horse, having charged round\r\nthe right flank of the enemy by Overkirk, had thrown him into entire\r\nconfusion, a general advance was made, and our whole line of foot,\r\ncrossing the little river and the morass, ascended the high ground where\r\nthe French were posted, cheering as they went, the enemy retreating\r\nbefore them. 'Twas a service of more glory than danger, the French\r\nbattalions never waiting to exchange push of pike or bayonet with ours;\r\nand the gunners flying from their pieces, which our line left behind us\r\nas they advanced, and the French fell back.\r\n\r\nAt first it was a retreat orderly enough; but presently the retreat\r\nbecame a rout, and a frightful slaughter of the French ensued on this\r\npanic: so that an army of sixty thousand men was utterly crushed and\r\ndestroyed in the course of a couple of hours. It was as if a hurricane\r\nhad seized a compact numerous fleet, flung it all to the winds,\r\nshattered, sunk, and annihilated it: afflavit Deus, et dissipati sunt.\r\nThe French army of Flanders was gone, their artillery, their standards,\r\ntheir treasure, provisions, and ammunition were all left behind them:\r\nthe poor devils had even fled without their soup-kettles, which are\r\nas much the palladia of the French infantry as of the Grand Seignior's\r\nJanissaries, and round which they rally even more than round their\r\nlilies.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit, and a dreadful carnage which ensued (for the dregs of a\r\nbattle, however brilliant, are ever a base residue of rapine, cruelty,\r\nand drunken plunder,) was carried far beyond the field of Ramillies.\r\n\r\nHonest Lockwood, Esmond's servant, no doubt wanted to be among the\r\nmarauders himself and take his share of the booty; for when, the action\r\nover, and the troops got to their ground for the night, the Captain bade\r\nLockwood get a horse, he asked, with a very rueful countenance, whether\r\nhis honor would have him come too; but his honor only bade him go about\r\nhis own business, and Jack hopped away quite delighted as soon as he\r\nsaw his master mounted. Esmond made his way, and not without danger\r\nand difficulty, to his Grace's headquarters, and found for himself very\r\nquickly where the aide-de-camps' quarters were, in an out-building of\r\na farm, where several of these gentlemen were seated, drinking and\r\nsinging, and at supper. If he had any anxiety about his boy, 'twas\r\nrelieved at once. One of the gentlemen was singing a song to a tune that\r\nMr. Farquhar and Mr. Gay both had used in their admirable comedies, and\r\nvery popular in the army of that day; and after the song came a chorus,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver the hills and far away;\xe2\x80\x9d and Esmond heard Frank's fresh voice,\r\nsoaring, as it were, over the songs of the rest of the young men--a\r\nvoice that had always a certain artless, indescribable pathos with it,\r\nand indeed which caused Mr. Esmond's eyes to fill with tears now, out\r\nof thankfulness to God the child was safe and still alive to laugh and\r\nsing.\r\n\r\nWhen the song was over Esmond entered the room, where he knew several of\r\nthe gentlemen present, and there sat my young lord, having taken off\r\nhis cuirass, his waistcoat open, his face flushed, his long yellow\r\nhair hanging over his shoulders, drinking with the rest; the youngest,\r\ngayest, handsomest there. As soon as he saw Esmond, he clapped down his\r\nglass, and running towards his friend, put both his arms round him and\r\nembraced him. The other's voice trembled with joy as he greeted the\r\nlad; he had thought but now as he stood in the court-yard under the\r\nclear-shining moonlight: \xe2\x80\x9cGreat God! what a scene of murder is here\r\nwithin a mile of us; what hundreds and thousands have faced danger\r\nto-day; and here are these lads singing over their cups, and the same\r\nmoon that is shining over yonder horrid field is looking down on Walcote\r\nvery likely, while my lady sits and thinks about her boy that is at the\r\nwar.\xe2\x80\x9d As Esmond embraced his young pupil now, 'twas with the feeling\r\nof quite religious thankfulness and an almost paternal pleasure that he\r\nbeheld him.\r\n\r\nRound his neck was a star with a striped ribbon, that was made of small\r\nbrilliants and might be worth a hundred crowns. \xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cwon't\r\nthat be a pretty present for mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you the Order?\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, saluting the gentleman: \xe2\x80\x9cdid you\r\nwin it in battle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, \xe2\x80\x9cwith my sword and my spear. There was a\r\nmousquetaire that had it round his neck--such a big mousquetaire, as big\r\nas General Webb. I called out to him to surrender, and that I'd give him\r\nquarter: he called me a petit polisson and fired his pistol at me, and\r\nthen sent it at my head with a curse. I rode at him, sir, drove my sword\r\nright under his arm-hole, and broke it in the rascal's body. I found\r\na purse in his holster with sixty-five Louis in it, and a bundle of\r\nlove-letters, and a flask of Hungary-water. Vive la guerre! there are\r\nthe ten pieces you lent me. I should like to have a fight every day;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and he pulled at his little moustache and bade a servant bring a supper\r\nto Captain Esmond.\r\n\r\nHarry fell to with a very good appetite; he had tasted nothing since\r\ntwenty hours ago, at early dawn. Master Grandson, who read this, do you\r\nlook for the history of battles and sieges? Go, find them in the proper\r\nbooks; this is only the story of your grandfather and his family. Far\r\nmore pleasant to him than the victory, though for that too he may say\r\nmeminisse juvat, it was to find that the day was over, and his dear\r\nyoung Castlewood was unhurt.\r\n\r\nAnd would you, sirrah, wish to know how it was that a sedate Captain\r\nof Foot, a studious and rather solitary bachelor of eight or nine and\r\ntwenty years of age, who did not care very much for the jollities which\r\nhis comrades engaged in, and was never known to lose his heart in any\r\ngarrison-town--should you wish to know why such a man had so prodigious\r\na tenderness, and tended so fondly a boy of eighteen, wait, my good\r\nfriend, until thou art in love with thy schoolfellow's sister, and then\r\nsee how mighty tender thou wilt be towards him. Esmond's general and\r\nhis Grace the Prince-Duke were notoriously at variance, and the former's\r\nfriendship was in nowise likely to advance any man's promotion of whose\r\nservices Webb spoke well; but rather likely to injure him, so the army\r\nsaid, in the favor of the greater man. However, Mr. Esmond had the good\r\nfortune to be mentioned very advantageously by Major-General Webb in his\r\nreport after the action; and the major of his regiment and two of the\r\ncaptains having been killed upon the day of Ramillies, Esmond, who was\r\nsecond of the lieutenants, got his company, and had the honor of serving\r\nas Captain Esmond in the next campaign.\r\n\r\nMy lord went home in the winter, but Esmond was afraid to follow him.\r\nHis dear mistress wrote him letters more than once, thanking him, as\r\nmothers know how to thank, for his care and protection of her boy,\r\nextolling Esmond's own merits with a great deal more praise than they\r\ndeserved; for he did his duty no better than any other officer; and\r\nspeaking sometimes, though gently and cautiously, of Beatrix. News came\r\nfrom home of at least half a dozen grand matches that the beautiful maid\r\nof honor was about to make. She was engaged to an earl, our gentleman of\r\nSt. James's said, and then jilted him for a duke, who, in his turn, had\r\ndrawn off. Earl or duke it might be who should win this Helen, Esmond\r\nknew she would never bestow herself on a poor captain. Her conduct, it\r\nwas clear, was little satisfactory to her mother, who scarcely mentioned\r\nher, or else the kind lady thought it was best to say nothing, and leave\r\ntime to work out its cure. At any rate, Harry was best away from the\r\nfatal object which always wrought him so much mischief; and so he never\r\nasked for leave to go home, but remained with his regiment that was\r\ngarrisoned in Brussels, which city fell into our hands when the victory\r\nof Ramillies drove the French out of Flanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nI MEET AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE IN FLANDERS, AND FIND MY MOTHER'S GRAVE AND\r\nMY OWN CRADLE THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing one day in the Church of St. Gudule, at Brussels, admiring the\r\nantique splendor of the architecture (and always entertaining a great\r\ntenderness and reverence for the Mother Church, that hath been as\r\nwickedly persecuted in England as ever she herself persecuted in the\r\ndays of her prosperity), Esmond saw kneeling at a side altar an officer\r\nin a green uniform coat, very deeply engaged in devotion. Something\r\nfamiliar in the figure and posture of the kneeling man struck Captain\r\nEsmond, even before he saw the officer's face. As he rose up, putting\r\naway into his pocket a little black breviary, such as priests use,\r\nEsmond beheld a countenance so like that of his friend and tutor of\r\nearly days, Father Holt, that he broke out into an exclamation of\r\nastonishment and advanced a step towards the gentleman, who was making\r\nhis way out of church. The German officer too looked surprised when he\r\nsaw Esmond, and his face from being pale grew suddenly red. By this mark\r\nof recognition, the Englishman knew that he could not be mistaken; and\r\nthough the other did not stop, but on the contrary rather hastily walked\r\naway towards the door, Esmond pursued him and faced him once more, as\r\nthe officer, helping himself to holy water, turned mechanically towards\r\nthe altar, to bow to it ere he quitted the sacred edifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Father!\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond in English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence! I do not understand. I do not speak English,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other\r\nin Latin.\r\n\r\nEsmond smiled at this sign of confusion, and replied in the same\r\nlanguage--\xe2\x80\x9cI should know my Father in any garment, black or white,\r\nshaven or bearded;\xe2\x80\x9d for the Austrian officer was habited quite in the\r\nmilitary manner, and had as warlike a mustachio as any Pandour.\r\n\r\nHe laughed--we were on the church steps by this time, passing through\r\nthe crowd of beggars that usually is there holding up little trinkets\r\nfor sale and whining for alms. \xe2\x80\x9cYou speak Latin,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cin the\r\nEnglish way, Harry Esmond; you have forsaken the old true Roman tongue\r\nyou once knew.\xe2\x80\x9d His tone was very frank, and friendly quite; the kind\r\nvoice of fifteen years back; he gave Esmond his hand as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOthers have changed their coats too, my Father,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, glancing\r\nat his friend's military decoration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! I am Mr. or Captain von Holtz, in the Bavarian Elector's service,\r\nand on a mission to his Highness the Prince of Savoy. You can keep a\r\nsecret I know from old times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain von Holtz,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cI am your very humble servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, too, have changed your coat,\xe2\x80\x9d continues the other in his\r\nlaughing way; \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of you at Cambridge and afterwards: we have\r\nfriends everywhere; and I am told that Mr. Esmond at Cambridge was as\r\ngood a fencer as he was a bad theologian.\xe2\x80\x9d (So, thinks Esmond, my old\r\nmaitre d'armes was a Jesuit, as they said.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, reading his thoughts quite as\r\nhe used to do in old days; \xe2\x80\x9cyou were all but killed at Hochstedt of a\r\nwound in the left side. You were before that at Vigo, aide-de-camp to\r\nthe Duke of Ormonde. You got your company the other day after Ramillies;\r\nyour general and the Prince-Duke are not friends; he is of the Webbs of\r\nLydiard Tregoze, in the county of York, a relation of my Lord St. John.\r\nYour cousin, M. de Castlewood, served his first campaign this year in\r\nthe Guard; yes, I do know a few things, as you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Esmond laughed in his turn. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have indeed a curious\r\nknowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. A foible of Mr. Holt's, who did know more about\r\nbooks and men than, perhaps, almost any person Esmond had ever met,\r\nwas omniscience; thus in every point he here professed to know, he was\r\nnearly right, but not quite. Esmond's wound was in the right side, not\r\nthe left; his first general was General Lumley; Mr. Webb came out of\r\nWiltshire, not out of Yorkshire; and so forth. Esmond did not think fit\r\nto correct his old master in these trifling blunders, but they served\r\nto give him a knowledge of the other's character, and he smiled to think\r\nthat this was his oracle of early days; only now no longer infallible or\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continues Father Holt, or Captain von Holtz, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a man who has\r\nnot been in England these eight years, I know what goes on in London\r\nvery well. The old Dean is dead, my Lady Castlewood's father. Do you\r\nknow that your recusant bishops wanted to consecrate him Bishop\r\nof Southampton, and that Collier is Bishop of Thetford by the same\r\nimposition? The Princess Anne has the gout and eats too much; when the\r\nKing returns, Collier will be an archbishop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope to see your Eminence no\r\nlonger in jack-boots, but red stockings, at Whitehall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are always with us--I know that--I heard of that when you were at\r\nCambridge; so was the late lord; so is the young viscount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so was my father before me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Esmond, looking calmly at the\r\nother, who did not, however, show the least sign of intelligence in his\r\nimpenetrable gray eyes--how well Harry remembered them and their look!\r\nonly crows' feet were wrinkled round them--marks of black old Time had\r\nsettled there.\r\n\r\nEsmond's face chose to show no more sign of meaning than the Father's.\r\nThere may have been on the one side and the other just the faintest\r\nglitter of recognition, as you see a bayonet shining out of an ambush;\r\nbut each party fell back, when everything was again dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, mon capitaine, where have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, turning\r\naway the conversation from this dangerous ground, where neither chose to\r\nengage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may have been in Pekin,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cor I may have been in\r\nParaguay--who knows where? I am now Captain von Holtz, in the service of\r\nhis Electoral Highness, come to negotiate exchange of prisoners with his\r\nHighness of Savoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n'Twas well known that very many officers in our army were well-affected\r\ntowards the young king at St. Germains, whose right to the throne was\r\nundeniable, and whose accession to it, at the death of his sister, by\r\nfar the greater part of the English people would have preferred, to\r\nthe having a petty German prince for a sovereign, about whose cruelty,\r\nrapacity, boorish manners, and odious foreign ways, a thousand stories\r\nwere current. It wounded our English pride to think that a shabby\r\nHigh-Dutch duke, whose revenues were not a tithe as great as those of\r\nmany of the princes of our ancient English nobility, who could not speak\r\na word of our language, and whom we chose to represent as a sort\r\nof German boor, feeding on train-oil and sour-crout, with a bevy of\r\nmistresses in a barn, should come to reign over the proudest and most\r\npolished people in the world. Were we, the conquerors of the Grand\r\nMonarch, to submit to that ignoble domination? What did the Hanoverian's\r\nProtestantism matter to us? Was it not notorious (we were told and led\r\nto believe so) that one of the daughters of this Protestant hero was\r\nbeing bred up with no religion at all, as yet, and ready to be made\r\nLutheran or Roman, according as the husband might be whom her parents\r\nshould find for her? This talk, very idle and abusive much of it was,\r\nwent on at a hundred mess-tables in the army; there was scarce an ensign\r\nthat did not hear it, or join in it, and everybody knew, or affected to\r\nknow, that the Commander-in-Chief himself had relations with his nephew,\r\nthe Duke of Berwick ['twas by an Englishman, thank God, that we were\r\nbeaten at Almanza), and that his Grace was most anxious to restore the\r\nroyal race of his benefactors, and to repair his former treason.\r\n\r\nThis is certain, that for a considerable period no officer in the\r\nDuke's army lost favor with the Commander-in-Chief for entertaining or\r\nproclaiming his loyalty towards the exiled family. When the Chevalier de\r\nSt. George, as the King of England called himself, came with the dukes\r\nof the French blood royal, to join the French army under Vendosme,\r\nhundreds of ours saw him and cheered him, and we all said he was like\r\nhis father in this, who, seeing the action of La Hogue fought between\r\nthe French ships and ours, was on the side of his native country during\r\nthe battle. But this, at least the Chevalier knew, and every one knew,\r\nthat, however well our troops and their general might be inclined\r\ntowards the prince personally, in the face of the enemy there was no\r\nquestion at all. Wherever my Lord Duke found a French army, he would\r\nfight and beat it, as he did at Oudenarde, two years after Ramillies,\r\nwhere his Grace achieved another of his transcendent victories; and the\r\nnoble young prince, who charged gallantly along with the magnificent\r\nMaison-du-Roy, sent to compliment his conquerors after the action.\r\n\r\nIn this battle, where the young Electoral Prince of Hanover behaved\r\nhimself very gallantly, fighting on our side, Esmond's dear General\r\nWebb distinguished himself prodigiously, exhibiting consummate skill\r\nand coolness as a general, and fighting with the personal bravery of\r\na common soldier. Esmond's good-luck again attended him; he escaped\r\nwithout a hurt, although more than a third of his regiment was killed,\r\nhad again the honor to be favorably mentioned in his commander's report,\r\nand was advanced to the rank of major. But of this action there is\r\nlittle need to speak, as it hath been related in every Gazette, and\r\ntalked of in every hamlet in this country. To return from it to the\r\nwriter's private affairs, which here, in his old age, and at a distance,\r\nhe narrates for his children who come after him. Before Oudenarde, after\r\nthat chance rencontre with Captain von Holtz at Brussels, a space of\r\nmore than a year elapsed, during which the captain of Jesuits and the\r\ncaptain of Webb's Fusileers were thrown very much together. Esmond had\r\nno difficulty in finding out (indeed, the other made no secret of it\r\nto him, being assured from old times of his pupil's fidelity), that\r\nthe negotiator of prisoners was an agent from St. Germains, and that he\r\ncarried intelligence between great personages in our camp and that of\r\nthe French. \xe2\x80\x9cMy business,\xe2\x80\x9d said he--\xe2\x80\x9cand I tell you, both because I can\r\ntrust you and your keen eyes have already discovered it--is between the\r\nKing of England and his subjects here engaged in fighting the French\r\nking. As between you and them, all the Jesuits in the world will not\r\nprevent your quarrelling: fight it out, gentlemen. St. George for\r\nEngland, I say--and you know who says so, wherever he may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI think Holt loved to make a parade of mystery, as it were, and would\r\nappear and disappear at our quarters as suddenly as he used to return\r\nand vanish in the old days at Castlewood. He had passes between both\r\narmies, and seemed to know (but with that inaccuracy which belonged to\r\nthe good Father's omniscience) equally well what passed in the French\r\ncamp and in ours. One day he would give Esmond news of a great feste\r\nthat took place in the French quarters, of a supper of Monsieur de\r\nRohan's, where there was play and violins, and then dancing and masques;\r\nthe King drove thither in Marshal Villars' own guinguette. Another day\r\nhe had the news of his Majesty's ague: the King had not had a fit these\r\nten days, and might be said to be well. Captain Holtz made a visit to\r\nEngland during this time, so eager was he about negotiating prisoners;\r\nand 'twas on returning from this voyage that he began to open himself\r\nmore to Esmond, and to make him, as occasion served, at their various\r\nmeetings, several of those confidences which are here set down all\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe reason of his increased confidence was this: upon going to London,\r\nthe old director of Esmond's aunt, the dowager, paid her ladyship a\r\nvisit at Chelsey, and there learnt from her that Captain Esmond was\r\nacquainted with the secret of his family, and was determined never to\r\ndivulge it. The knowledge of this fact raised Esmond in his old tutor's\r\neyes, so Holt was pleased to say, and he admired Harry very much for his\r\nabnegation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe family at Castlewood have done far more for me than my own ever\r\ndid,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would give my life for them. Why should I grudge\r\nthe only benefit that 'tis in my power to confer on them?\xe2\x80\x9d The good\r\nFather's eyes filled with tears at this speech, which to the other\r\nseemed very simple: he embraced Esmond, and broke out into many admiring\r\nexpressions; he said he was a noble coeur, that he was proud of him, and\r\nfond of him as his pupil and friend--regretted more than ever that he\r\nhad lost him, and been forced to leave him in those early times, when\r\nhe might have had an influence over him, have brought him into that\r\nonly true church to which the Father belonged, and enlisted him in the\r\nnoblest army in which a man ever engaged--meaning his own society of\r\nJesus, which numbers (says he) in its troops the greatest heroes the\r\nworld ever knew;--warriors brave enough to dare or endure anything, to\r\nencounter any odds, to die any death--soldiers that have won triumphs a\r\nthousand times more brilliant than those of the greatest general; that\r\nhave brought nations on their knees to their sacred banner, the Cross;\r\nthat have achieved glories and palms incomparably brighter than those\r\nawarded to the most splendid earthly conquerors--crowns of immortal\r\nlight, and seats in the high places of heaven.\r\n\r\nEsmond was thankful for his old friend's good opinion, however little\r\nhe might share the Jesuit-father's enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of\r\nthat question, too,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cdear Father,\xe2\x80\x9d and he took the other's\r\nhand--\xe2\x80\x9cthought it out for myself, as all men must, and contrive to do\r\nthe right, and trust to heaven as devoutly in my way as you in yours.\r\nAnother six months of you as a child, and I had desired no better. I\r\nused to weep upon my pillow at Castlewood as I thought of you, and I\r\nmight have been a brother of your order; and who knows,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond added,\r\nwith a smile, \xe2\x80\x9ca priest in full orders, and with a pair of mustachios,\r\nand a Bavarian uniform?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son,\xe2\x80\x9d says Father Holt, turning red, \xe2\x80\x9cin the cause of religion and\r\nloyalty all disguises are fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9call disguises are fair, you say; and all\r\nuniforms, say I, black or red,--a black cockade or a white one--or a\r\nlaced hat, or a sombrero, with a tonsure under it. I cannot believe that\r\nSt. Francis Xavier sailed over the sea in a cloak, or raised the dead--I\r\ntried, and very nearly did once, but cannot. Suffer me to do the right,\r\nand to hope for the best in my own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond wished to cut short the good Father's theology, and succeeded;\r\nand the other, sighing over his pupil's invincible ignorance, did not\r\nwithdraw his affection from him, but gave him his utmost confidence--as\r\nmuch, that is to say, as a priest can give: more than most do; for he\r\nwas naturally garrulous, and too eager to speak.\r\n\r\nHolt's friendship encouraged Captain Esmond to ask, what he long wished\r\nto know, and none could tell him, some history of the poor mother\r\nwhom he had often imagined in his dreams, and whom he never knew. He\r\ndescribed to Holt those circumstances which are already put down in the\r\nfirst part of this story--the promise he had made to his dear lord, and\r\nthat dying friend's confession; and he besought Mr. Holt to tell him\r\nwhat he knew regarding the poor woman from whom he had been taken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was of this very town,\xe2\x80\x9d Holt said, and took Esmond to see the\r\nstreet where her father lived, and where, as he believed, she was born.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn 1676, when your father came hither in the retinue of the late king,\r\nthen Duke of York, and banished hither in disgrace, Captain Thomas\r\nEsmond became acquainted with your mother, pursued her, and made a\r\nvictim of her; he hath told me in many subsequent conversations, which\r\nI felt bound to keep private then, that she was a woman of great virtue\r\nand tenderness, and in all respects a most fond, faithful creature. He\r\ncalled himself Captain Thomas, having good reason to be ashamed of\r\nhis conduct towards her, and hath spoken to me many times with sincere\r\nremorse for that, as with fond love for her many amiable qualities, he\r\nowned to having treated her very ill: and that at this time his life was\r\none of profligacy, gambling, and poverty. She became with child of\r\nyou; was cursed by her own parents at that discovery; though she never\r\nupbraided, except by her involuntary tears, and the misery depicted on\r\nher countenance, the author of her wretchedness and ruin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomas Esmond--Captain Thomas, as he was called--became engaged in a\r\ngaming-house brawl, of which the consequence was a duel, and a wound so\r\nsevere that he never--his surgeon said--could outlive it. Thinking his\r\ndeath certain, and touched with remorse, he sent for a priest of the\r\nvery Church of St. Gudule where I met you; and on the same day, after\r\nhis making submission to our Church, was married to your mother a few\r\nweeks before you were born. My Lord Viscount Castlewood, Marquis of\r\nEsmond, by King James's patent, which I myself took to your father, your\r\nlordship was christened at St. Gudule by the same cure who married your\r\nparents, and by the name of Henry Thomas, son of E. Thomas, officier\r\nAnglois, and Gertrude Maes. You see you belong to us from your birth,\r\nand why I did not christen you when you became my dear little pupil at\r\nCastlewood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father's wound took a favorable turn--perhaps his conscience was\r\neased by the right he had done--and to the surprise of the doctors\r\nhe recovered. But as his health came back, his wicked nature, too,\r\nreturned. He was tired of the poor girl, whom he had ruined; and\r\nreceiving some remittance from his uncle, my lord the old viscount, then\r\nin England, he pretended business, promised return, and never saw your\r\npoor mother more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe owned to me, in confession first, but afterwards in talk before your\r\naunt, his wife, else I never could have disclosed what I now tell you,\r\nthat on coming to London he writ a pretended confession to poor Gertrude\r\nMaes--Gertrude Esmond--of his having been married in England previously,\r\nbefore uniting himself with her; said that his name was not Thomas;\r\nthat he was about to quit Europe for the Virginian plantations, where,\r\nindeed, your family had a grant of land from King Charles the First;\r\nsent her a supply of money, the half of the last hundred guineas he had,\r\nentreated her pardon, and bade her farewell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Gertrude never thought that the news in this letter might be\r\nuntrue as the rest of your father's conduct to her. But though a young\r\nman of her own degree, who knew her history, and whom she liked before\r\nshe saw the English gentleman who was the cause of all her misery,\r\noffered to marry her, and to adopt you as his own child, and give you\r\nhis name, she refused him. This refusal only angered her father, who had\r\ntaken her home; she never held up her head there, being the subject\r\nof constant unkindness after her fall; and some devout ladies of her\r\nacquaintance offering to pay a little pension for her, she went into a\r\nconvent, and you were put out to nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sister of the young fellow who would have adopted you as his son\r\nwas the person who took charge of you. Your mother and this person were\r\ncousins. She had just lost a child of her own, which you replaced, your\r\nown mother being too sick and feeble to feed you; and presently your\r\nnurse grew so fond of you, that she even grudged letting you visit the\r\nconvent where your mother was, and where the nuns petted the little\r\ninfant, as they pitied and loved its unhappy parent. Her vocation became\r\nstronger every day, and at the end of two years she was received as a\r\nsister of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour nurse's family were silk-weavers out of France, whither they\r\nreturned to Arras in French Flanders, shortly before your mother took\r\nher vows, carrying you with them, then a child of three years old. 'Twas\r\na town, before the late vigorous measures of the French king, full of\r\nProtestants, and here your nurse's father, old Pastoureau, he with\r\nwhom you afterwards lived at Ealing, adopted the reformed doctrines,\r\nperverting all his house with him. They were expelled thence by the\r\nedict of his most Christian Majesty, and came to London, and set up\r\ntheir looms in Spittlefields. The old man brought a little money with\r\nhim, and carried on his trade, but in a poor way. He was a widower; by\r\nthis time his daughter, a widow too, kept house for him, and his son\r\nand he labored together at their vocation. Meanwhile your father had\r\npublicly owned his conversion just before King Charles's death (in whom\r\nour Church had much such another convert), was reconciled to my Lord\r\nViscount Castlewood, and married, as you know, to his daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt chanced that the younger Pastoureau, going with a piece of brocade\r\nto the mercer who employed him, on Ludgate Hill, met his old rival\r\ncoming out of an ordinary there. Pastoureau knew your father at once,\r\nseized him by the collar, and upbraided him as a villain, who had\r\nseduced his mistress, and afterwards deserted her and her son. Mr.\r\nThomas Esmond also recognized Pastoureau at once, besought him to calm\r\nhis indignation, and not to bring a crowd round about them; and bade\r\nhim to enter into the tavern, out of which he had just stepped, when\r\nhe would give him any explanation. Pastoureau entered, and heard the\r\nlandlord order the drawer to show Captain Thomas to a room; it was by\r\nhis Christian name that your father was familiarly called at his tavern\r\nhaunts, which, to say the truth, were none of the most reputable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you that Captain Thomas, or my Lord Viscount afterwards,\r\nwas never at a loss for a story, and could cajole a woman or a dun with\r\na volubility, and an air of simplicity at the same time, of which many\r\na creditor of his has been the dupe. His tales used to gather\r\nverisimilitude as he went on with them. He strung together fact after\r\nfact with a wonderful rapidity and coherence. It required, saving your\r\npresence, a very long habit of acquaintance with your father to know\r\nwhen his lordship was l----,--telling the truth or no.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me with rueful remorse when he was ill--for the fear of death\r\nset him instantly repenting, and with shrieks of laughter when he was\r\nwell, his lordship having a very great sense of humor--how in a half an\r\nhour's time, and before a bottle was drunk, he had completely succeeded\r\nin biting poor Pastoureau. The seduction he owned to: that he could not\r\nhelp: he was quite ready with tears at a moment's warning, and shed them\r\nprofusely to melt his credulous listener. He wept for your mother even\r\nmore than Pastoureau did, who cried very heartily, poor fellow, as my\r\nlord informed me; he swore upon his honor that he had twice sent money\r\nto Brussels, and mentioned the name of the merchant with whom it was\r\nlying for poor Gertrude's use. He did not even know whether she had\r\na child or no, or whether she was alive or dead; but got these facts\r\neasily out of honest Pastoureau's answers to him. When he heard that\r\nshe was in a convent, he said he hoped to end his days in one himself,\r\nshould he survive his wife, whom he hated, and had been forced by a\r\ncruel father to marry; and when he was told that Gertrude's son was\r\nalive, and actually in London, 'I started,' says he; 'for then, damme,\r\nmy wife was expecting to lie in, and I thought should this old Put, my\r\nfather-in-law, run rusty, here would be a good chance to frighten him.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe expressed the deepest gratitude to the Pastoureau family for the\r\ncare of the infant: you were now near six years old; and on Pastoureau\r\nbluntly telling him, when he proposed to go that instant and see the\r\ndarling child, that they never wished to see his ill-omened face again\r\nwithin their doors; that he might have the boy, though they should all\r\nbe very sorry to lose him; and that they would take his money, they\r\nbeing poor, if he gave it; or bring him up, by God's help, as they had\r\nhitherto done, without: he acquiesced in this at once, with a sigh,\r\nsaid, 'Well, 'twas better that the dear child should remain with\r\nfriends who had been so admirably kind to him;' and in his talk to\r\nme afterwards, honestly praised and admired the weaver's conduct and\r\nspirit; owned that the Frenchman was a right fellow, and he, the Lord\r\nhave mercy upon him, a sad villain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holt went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cwas good-natured with his money\r\nwhen he had it; and having that day received a supply from his uncle,\r\ngave the weaver ten pieces with perfect freedom, and promised him\r\nfurther remittances. He took down eagerly Pastoureau's name and place of\r\nabode in his table-book, and when the other asked him for his own,\r\ngave, with the utmost readiness, his name as Captain Thomas, New Lodge,\r\nPenzance, Cornwall; he said he was in London for a few days only on\r\nbusiness connected with his wife's property; described her as a shrew,\r\nthough a woman of kind disposition; and depicted his father as a Cornish\r\nsquire, in an infirm state of health, at whose death he hoped for\r\nsomething handsome, when he promised richly to reward the admirable\r\nprotector of his child, and to provide for the boy. 'And by Gad, sir,'\r\nhe said to me in his strange laughing way, 'I ordered a piece of brocade\r\nof the very same pattern as that which the fellow was carrying, and\r\npresented it to my wife for a morning wrapper, to receive company after\r\nshe lay in of our little boy.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour little pension was paid regularly enough; and when your father\r\nbecame Viscount Castlewood on his uncle's demise, I was employed to keep\r\na watch over you, and 'twas at my instance that you were brought home.\r\nYour foster-mother was dead; her father made acquaintance with a woman\r\nwhom he married, who quarrelled with his son. The faithful creature came\r\nback to Brussels to be near the woman he loved, and died, too, a few\r\nmonths before her. Will you see her cross in the convent cemetery? The\r\nSuperior is an old penitent of mine, and remembers Soeur Marie Madeleine\r\nfondly still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nEsmond came to this spot in one sunny evening of spring, and saw,\r\namidst a thousand black crosses, casting their shadows across the grassy\r\nmounds, that particular one which marked his mother's resting-place.\r\nMany more of those poor creatures that lay there had adopted that same\r\nname, with which sorrow had rebaptized her, and which fondly seemed to\r\nhint their individual story of love and grief. He fancied her in tears\r\nand darkness, kneeling at the foot of her cross, under which her cares\r\nwere buried. Surely he knelt down, and said his own prayer there, not\r\nin sorrow so much as in awe (for even his memory had no recollection of\r\nher), and in pity for the pangs which the gentle soul in life had\r\nbeen made to suffer. To this cross she brought them; for this heavenly\r\nbridegroom she exchanged the husband who had wooed her, the traitor\r\nwho had left her. A thousand such hillocks lay round about, the gentle\r\ndaisies springing out of the grass over them, and each bearing its\r\ncross and requiescat. A nun, veiled in black, was kneeling hard by, at a\r\nsleeping sister's bedside (so fresh made, that the spring had scarce\r\nhad time to spin a coverlid for it); beyond the cemetery walls you had\r\nglimpses of life and the world, and the spires and gables of the city. A\r\nbird came down from a roof opposite, and lit first on a cross, and then\r\non the grass below it, whence it flew away presently with a leaf in its\r\nmouth: then came a sound as of chanting, from the chapel of the\r\nsisters hard by; others had long since filled the place which poor Mary\r\nMagdeleine once had there, were kneeling at the same stall, and hearing\r\nthe same hymns and prayers in which her stricken heart had found\r\nconsolation. Might she sleep in peace--might she sleep in peace; and we,\r\ntoo, when our struggles and pains are over! But the earth is the Lord's\r\nas the heaven is; we are alike his creatures here and yonder. I took a\r\nlittle flower off the hillock and kissed it, and went my way, like\r\nthe bird that had just lighted on the cross by me, back into the world\r\nagain. Silent receptacle of death; tranquil depth of calm, out of reach\r\nof tempest and trouble! I felt as one who had been walking below the\r\nsea, and treading amidst the bones of shipwrecks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF 1707, 1708.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the year which succeeded that in which the glorious\r\nbattle of Ramillies had been fought, our army made no movement of\r\nimportance, much to the disgust of very many of our officers remaining\r\ninactive in Flanders, who said that his Grace the Captain-General had\r\nhad fighting enough, and was all for money now, and the enjoyment of his\r\nfive thousand a year and his splendid palace at Woodstock, which was\r\nnow being built. And his Grace had sufficient occupation fighting his\r\nenemies at home this year, where it began to be whispered that his favor\r\nwas decreasing, and his duchess losing her hold on the Queen, who was\r\ntransferring her royal affections to the famous Mrs. Masham, and Mrs.\r\nMasham's humble servant, Mr. Harley. Against their intrigues, our Duke\r\npassed a great part of his time intriguing. Mr. Harley was got out\r\nof office, and his Grace, in so far, had a victory. But her Majesty,\r\nconvinced against her will, was of that opinion still, of which the poet\r\nsays people are when so convinced, and Mr. Harley before long had his\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the business of fighting did not go on any way to the\r\nsatisfaction of Marlborough's gallant lieutenants. During all 1707,\r\nwith the French before us, we had never so much as a battle; our army in\r\nSpain was utterly routed at Almanza by the gallant Duke of Berwick; and\r\nwe of Webb's, which regiment the young Duke had commanded before his\r\nfather's abdication, were a little proud to think that it was our\r\ncolonel who had achieved this victory. \xe2\x80\x9cI think if I had had Galway's\r\nplace, and my Fusileers,\xe2\x80\x9d says our General, \xe2\x80\x9cwe would not have laid down\r\nour arms, even to our old colonel, as Galway did;\xe2\x80\x9d and Webb's officers\r\nswore if we had had Webb, at least we would not have been taken\r\nprisoners. Our dear old general talked incautiously of himself and of\r\nothers; a braver or a more brilliant soldier never lived than he; but\r\nhe blew his honest trumpet rather more loudly than became a commander of\r\nhis station, and, mighty man of valor as he was, shook his great spear\r\nand blustered before the army too fiercely.\r\n\r\nMysterious Mr. Holtz went off on a secret expedition in the early part\r\nof 1708, with great elation of spirits and a prophecy to Esmond that a\r\nwonderful something was about to take place. This secret came out on\r\nmy friend's return to the army, whither he brought a most rueful and\r\ndejected countenance, and owned that the great something he had been\r\nengaged upon had failed utterly. He had been indeed with that luckless\r\nexpedition of the Chevalier de St. George, who was sent by the French\r\nking with ships and an army from Dunkirk, and was to have invaded\r\nand conquered Scotland. But that ill wind which ever opposed all the\r\nprojects upon which the Prince ever embarked, prevented the Chevalier's\r\ninvasion of Scotland, as 'tis known, and blew poor Monsieur von Holtz\r\nback into our camp again, to scheme and foretell, and to pry about as\r\nusual. The Chevalier (the king of England, as some of us held him) went\r\nfrom Dunkirk to the French army to make the campaign against us. The\r\nDuke of Burgundy had the command this year, having the Duke of Berry\r\nwith him, and the famous Mareschal Vendosme and the Duke of Matignon to\r\naid him in the campaign. Holtz, who knew everything that was passing\r\nin Flanders and France (and the Indies for what I know), insisted that\r\nthere would be no more fighting in 1708 than there had been in the\r\nprevious year, and that our commander had reasons for keeping him quiet.\r\nIndeed, Esmond's general, who was known as a grumbler, and to have a\r\nhearty mistrust of the great Duke, and hundreds more officers besides,\r\ndid not scruple to say that these private reasons came to the Duke\r\nin the shape of crown-pieces from the French King, by whom the\r\nGeneralissimo was bribed to avoid a battle. There were plenty of men in\r\nour lines, quidnuncs, to whom Mr. Webb listened only too willingly, who\r\ncould specify the exact sums the Duke got, how much fell to Cadogan's\r\nshare, and what was the precise fee given to Doctor Hare.\r\n\r\nAnd the successes with which the French began the campaign of 1708\r\nserved to give strength to these reports of treason, which were in\r\neverybody's mouth. Our general allowed the enemy to get between us and\r\nGhent, and declined to attack him, though for eight and forty hours the\r\narmies were in presence of each other. Ghent was taken, and on the same\r\nday Monsieur de la Mothe summoned Bruges; and these two great cities\r\nfell into the hands of the French without firing a shot. A few days\r\nafterwards La Mothe seized upon the fort of Plashendall: and it began\r\nto be supposed that all Spanish Flanders, as well as Brabant, would fall\r\ninto the hands of the French troops; when the Prince Eugene arrived from\r\nthe Mozelle, and then there was no more shilly-shallying.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Savoy always signalized his arrival at the army by a great\r\nfeast (my Lord Duke's entertainments were both seldom and shabby): and\r\nI remember our general returning from this dinner with the two\r\ncommanders-in-chief; his honest head a little excited by wine, which\r\nwas dealt out much more liberally by the Austrian than by the English\r\ncommander:--\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d says my general, slapping the table, with an oath,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che must fight; and when he is forced to it, d--- it, no man in Europe\r\ncan stand up against Jack Churchill.\xe2\x80\x9d Within a week the battle of\r\nOudenarde was fought, when, hate each other as they might, Esmond's\r\ngeneral and the Commander-in-Chief were forced to admire each other, so\r\nsplendid was the gallantry of each upon this day.\r\n\r\nThe brigade commanded by Major-General Webb gave and received about\r\nas hard knocks as any that were delivered in that action, in which Mr.\r\nEsmond had the fortune to serve at the head of his own company in his\r\nregiment, under the command of their own Colonel as Major-General; and\r\nit was his good luck to bring the regiment out of action as commander\r\nof it, the four senior officers above him being killed in the prodigious\r\nslaughter which happened on that day. I like to think that Jack\r\nHaythorn, who sneered at me for being a bastard and a parasite of\r\nWebb's, as he chose to call me, and with whom I had had words, shook\r\nhands with me the day before the battle began. Three days before, poor\r\nBrace, our Lieutenant-Colonel, had heard of his elder brother's death,\r\nand was heir to a baronetcy in Norfolk, and four thousand a year. Fate,\r\nthat had left him harmless through a dozen campaigns, seized on him just\r\nas the world was worth living for, and he went into action knowing, as\r\nhe said, that the luck was going to turn against him. The Major had just\r\njoined us--a creature of Lord Marlborough, put in much to the dislike of\r\nthe other officers, and to be a spy upon us, as it was said. I know\r\nnot whether the truth was so, nor who took the tattle of our mess to\r\nheadquarters, but Webb's regiment, as its Colonel, was known to be in\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief's black books: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he did not dare to break\r\nit up at home,\xe2\x80\x9d our gallant old chief used to say, \xe2\x80\x9che was determined to\r\ndestroy it before the enemy;\xe2\x80\x9d so that poor Major Proudfoot was put into\r\na post of danger.\r\n\r\nEsmond's dear young Viscount, serving as aide-de-camp to my Lord Duke,\r\nreceived a wound, and won an honorable name for himself in the Gazette;\r\nand Captain Esmond's name was sent in for promotion by his General, too,\r\nwhose favorite he was. It made his heart beat to think that certain eyes\r\nat home, the brightest in the world, might read the page on which his\r\nhumble services were recorded; but his mind was made up steadily to keep\r\nout of their dangerous influence, and to let time and absence conquer\r\nthat passion he had still lurking about him. Away from Beatrix, it did\r\nnot trouble him; but he knew as certain that if he returned home, his\r\nfever would break out again, and avoided Walcote as a Lincolnshire man\r\navoids returning to his fens, where he is sure that the ague is lying in\r\nwait for him.\r\n\r\nWe of the English party in the army, who were inclined to sneer at\r\neverything that came out of Hanover, and to treat as little better than\r\nboors and savages the Elector's court and family, were yet forced to\r\nconfess that, on the day of Oudenarde, the young Electoral Prince, then\r\nmaking his first campaign, conducted himself with the spirit and courage\r\nof an approved soldier. On this occasion his Electoral Highness had\r\nbetter luck than the King of England, who was with his cousins in the\r\nenemy's camp, and had to run with them at the ignominious end of the\r\nday. With the most consummate generals in the world before them, and\r\nan admirable commander on their own side, they chose to neglect the\r\ncouncils, and to rush into a combat with the former, which would have\r\nended in the utter annihilation of their army but for the great skill\r\nand bravery of the Duke of Vendosme, who remedied, as far as courage and\r\ngenius might, the disasters occasioned by the squabbles and follies of\r\nhis kinsmen, the legitimate princes of the blood royal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Duke of Berwick had but been in the army, the fate of the day\r\nwould have been very different,\xe2\x80\x9d was all that poor Mr. von Holtz could\r\nsay; \xe2\x80\x9cand you would have seen that the hero of Almanza was fit to\r\nmeasure swords with the conqueror of Blenheim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe business relative to the exchange of prisoners was always going on,\r\nand was at least that ostensible one which kept Mr. Holtz perpetually on\r\nthe move between the forces of the French and the Allies. I can answer\r\nfor it, that he was once very near hanged as a spy by Major-General\r\nWayne, when he was released and sent on to head-quarters by a special\r\norder of the Commander-in-Chief. He came and went, always favored,\r\nwherever he was, by some high though occult protection. He carried\r\nmessages between the Duke of Berwick and his uncle, our Duke. He seemed\r\nto know as well what was taking place in the Prince's quarter as our\r\nown: he brought the compliments of the King of England to some of our\r\nofficers, the gentlemen of Webb's among the rest, for their behavior on\r\nthat great day; and after Wynendael, when our General was chafing at the\r\nneglect of our Commander-in-Chief, he said he knew how that action\r\nwas regarded by the chiefs of the French army, and that the stand made\r\nbefore Wynendael wood was the passage by which the Allies entered Lille.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says Holtz (and some folks were very willing to listen to him),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif the king came by his own, how changed the conduct of affairs would\r\nbe! His Majesty's very exile has this advantage, that he is enabled to\r\nread England impartially, and to judge honestly of all the eminent men.\r\nHis sister is always in the hand of one greedy favorite or another,\r\nthrough whose eyes she sees, and to whose flattery or dependants she\r\ngives away everything. Do you suppose that his Majesty, knowing England\r\nso well as he does, would neglect such a man as General Webb? He ought\r\nto be in the House of Peers as Lord Lydiard. The enemy and all Europe\r\nknow his merit; it is that very reputation which certain great people,\r\nwho hate all equality and independence, can never pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nintended that these conversations should be carried to Mr. Webb. They\r\nwere welcome to him, for great as his services were, no man could value\r\nthem more than John Richmond Webb did himself, and the differences\r\nbetween him and Marlborough being notorious, his Grace's enemies in\r\nthe army and at home began to court Webb, and set him up against\r\nthe all-grasping, domineering chief. And soon after the victory of\r\nOudenarde, a glorious opportunity fell into General Webb's way, which\r\nthat gallant warrior did not neglect, and which gave him the means of\r\nimmensely increasing his reputation at home.\r\n\r\nAfter Oudenarde, and against the counsels of Marlborough, it was\r\nsaid, the Prince of Savoy sat down before Lille, the capital of French\r\nFlanders, and commenced that siege, the most celebrated of our time,\r\nand almost as famous as the siege of Troy itself, for the feats of valor\r\nperformed in the assault and the defence. The enmity of the Prince of\r\nSavoy against the French king was a furious personal hate, quite unlike\r\nthe calm hostility of our great English general, who was no more moved\r\nby the game of war than that of billiards, and pushed forward his\r\nsquadrons, and drove his red battalions hither and thither as calmly as\r\nhe would combine a stroke or make a cannon with the balls. The game\r\nover (and he played it so as to be pretty sure to win it), not the\r\nleast animosity against the other party remained in the breast of this\r\nconsummate tactician. Whereas between the Prince of Savoy and the French\r\nit was guerre a mort. Beaten off in one quarter, as he had been at\r\nToulon in the last year, he was back again on another frontier of\r\nFrance, assailing it with his indefatigable fury. When the Prince came\r\nto the army, the smouldering fires of war were lighted up and burst\r\nout into a flame. Our phlegmatic Dutch allies were made to advance at a\r\nquick march--our calm Duke forced into action. The Prince was an army\r\nin himself against the French; the energy of his hatred, prodigious,\r\nindefatigable--infectious over hundreds of thousands of men. The\r\nEmperor's general was repaying, and with a vengeance, the slight the\r\nFrench King had put upon the fiery little Abbe of Savoy. Brilliant and\r\nfamous as a leader himself, and beyond all measure daring and intrepid,\r\nand enabled to cope with almost the best of those famous men of war who\r\ncommanded the armies of the French King, Eugene had a weapon, the equal\r\nof which could not be found in France, since the cannon-shot of Sasbach\r\nlaid low the noble Turenne, and could hurl Marlborough at the heads\r\nof the French host, and crush them as with a rock, under which all the\r\ngathered strength of their strongest captains must go down.\r\n\r\nThe English Duke took little part in that vast siege of Lille, which\r\nthe Imperial Generalissimo pursued with all his force and vigor, further\r\nthan to cover the besieging lines from the Duke of Burgundy's army,\r\nbetween which and the Imperialists our Duke lay. Once, when Prince\r\nEugene was wounded, our Duke took his Highness's place in the trenches;\r\nbut the siege was with the Imperialists, not with us. A division under\r\nWebb and Rantzau was detached into Artois and Picardy upon the most\r\npainful and odious service that Mr. Esmond ever saw in the course of his\r\nmilitary life. The wretched towns of the defenceless provinces, whose\r\nyoung men had been drafted away into the French armies, which year after\r\nyear the insatiable war devoured, were left at our mercy; and our orders\r\nwere to show them none. We found places garrisoned by invalids,\r\nand children and women; poor as they were, and as the costs of this\r\nmiserable war had made them, our commission was to rob these almost\r\nstarving wretches--to tear the food out of their granaries, and strip\r\nthem of their rags. 'Twas an expedition of rapine and murder we were\r\nsent on: our soldiers did deeds such as an honest man must blush to\r\nremember. We brought back money and provisions in quantity to the Duke's\r\ncamp; there had been no one to resist us, and yet who dares to tell with\r\nwhat murder and violence, with what brutal cruelty, outrage, insult,\r\nthat ignoble booty had been ravished from the innocent and miserable\r\nvictims of the war?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, gallantly as the operations before Lille had been conducted,\r\nthe Allies had made but little progress, and 'twas said when we returned\r\nto the Duke of Marlborough's camp, that the siege would never be brought\r\nto a satisfactory end, and that the Prince of Savoy would be forced to\r\nraise it. My Lord Marlborough gave this as his opinion openly; those who\r\nmistrusted him, and Mr. Esmond owns himself to be of the number, hinted\r\nthat the Duke had his reasons why Lille should not be taken, and that he\r\nwas paid to that end by the French King. If this was so, and I believe\r\nit, General Webb had now a remarkable opportunity of gratifying his\r\nhatred of the Commander-in-Chief, of balking that shameful avarice,\r\nwhich was one of the basest and most notorious qualities of the famous\r\nDuke, and of showing his own consummate skill as a commander. And when\r\nI consider all the circumstances preceding the event which will now\r\nbe related, that my Lord Duke was actually offered certain millions\r\nof crowns provided that the siege of Lille should be raised: that the\r\nImperial army before it was without provisions and ammunition, and must\r\nhave decamped but for the supplies that they received; that the march\r\nof the convoy destined to relieve the siege was accurately known to the\r\nFrench; and that the force covering it was shamefully inadequate to that\r\nend, and by six times inferior to Count de la Mothe's army, which\r\nwas sent to intercept the convoy; when 'tis certain that the Duke of\r\nBerwick, De la Mothe's chief, was in constant correspondence with his\r\nuncle, the English Generalissimo: I believe on my conscience that 'twas\r\nmy Lord Marlborough's intention to prevent those supplies, of which the\r\nPrince of Savoy stood in absolute need, from ever reaching his Highness;\r\nthat he meant to sacrifice the little army which covered this convoy,\r\nand to betray it as he had betrayed Tollemache at Brest; as he had\r\nbetrayed every friend he had, to further his own schemes of avarice or\r\nambition. But for the miraculous victory which Esmond's general won over\r\nan army six or seven times greater than his own, the siege of Lille\r\nmust have been raised; and it must be remembered that our gallant little\r\nforce was under the command of a general whom Marlborough hated, that he\r\nwas furious with the conqueror, and tried by the most open and shameless\r\ninjustice afterwards to rob him of the credit of his victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nGENERAL WEBB WINS THE BATTLE OF WYNENDAEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the besiegers and besieged of Lille, some of the most brilliant feats\r\nof valor were performed that ever illustrated any war. On the French\r\nside (whose gallantry was prodigious, the skill and bravery of Marshal\r\nBoufflers actually eclipsing those of his conqueror, the Prince of\r\nSavoy) may be mentioned that daring action of Messieurs de Luxembourg\r\nand Tournefort, who, with a body of horse and dragoons, carried powder\r\ninto the town, of which the besieged were in extreme want, each soldier\r\nbringing a bag with forty pounds of powder behind him; with which\r\nperilous provision they engaged our own horse, faced the fire of the\r\nfoot brought out to meet them: and though half of the men were blown up\r\nin the dreadful errand they rode on, a part of them got into the town\r\nwith the succors of which the garrison was so much in want. A French\r\nofficer, Monsieur du Bois, performed an act equally daring, and\r\nperfectly successful. The Duke's great army lying at Helchin, and\r\ncovering the siege, and it being necessary for M. de Vendosme to get\r\nnews of the condition of the place, Captain Dubois performed his famous\r\nexploit: not only passing through the lines of the siege, but swimming\r\nafterwards no less than seven moats and ditches: and coming back the\r\nsame way, swimming with his letters in his mouth.\r\n\r\nBy these letters Monsieur de Boufflers said that he could undertake\r\nto hold the place till October; and that if one of the convoys of the\r\nAllies could be intercepted, they must raise the siege altogether.\r\n\r\nSuch a convoy as hath been said was now prepared at Ostend, and about to\r\nmarch for the siege; and on the 27th September we (and the French\r\ntoo) had news that it was on its way. It was composed of 700 wagons,\r\ncontaining ammunition of all sorts, and was escorted out of Ostend by\r\n2,000 infantry and 300 horse. At the same time M. de la Mothe quitted\r\nBruges, having with him five-and-thirty battalions, and upwards of sixty\r\nsquadrons and forty guns, in pursuit of the convoy.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Webb had meanwhile made up a force of twenty battalions\r\nand three squadrons of dragoons at Turout, whence he moved to cover the\r\nconvoy and pursue La Mothe: with whose advanced guard ours came up upon\r\nthe great plain of Turout, and before the little wood and castle of\r\nWynendael; behind which the convoy was marching.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they came in sight of the enemy, our advanced troops were\r\nhalted, with the wood behind them, and the rest of our force brought up\r\nas quickly as possible, our little body of horse being brought forward\r\nto the opening of the plain, as our General said, to amuse the enemy.\r\nWhen M. de la Mothe came up, he found us posted in two lines in front of\r\nthe wood; and formed his own army in battle facing ours, in eight lines,\r\nfour of infantry in front, and dragoons and cavalry behind.\r\n\r\nThe French began the action, as usual, with a cannonade which lasted\r\nthree hours, when they made their attack, advancing in eight lines, four\r\nof foot and four of horse, upon the allied troops in the wood where we\r\nwere posted. Their infantry behaved ill; they were ordered to charge\r\nwith the bayonet, but, instead, began to fire, and almost at the very\r\nfirst discharge from our men, broke and fled. The cavalry behaved\r\nbetter; with these alone, who were three or four times as numerous as\r\nour whole force, Monsieur de la Mothe might have won victory: but only\r\ntwo of our battalions were shaken in the least; and these speedily\r\nrallied: nor could the repeated attacks of the French horse cause our\r\ntroops to budge an inch from the position in the wood in which our\r\nGeneral had placed them.\r\n\r\nAfter attacking for two hours, the French retired at nightfall entirely\r\nfoiled. With all the loss we had inflicted upon him, the enemy was still\r\nthree times stronger than we: and it could not be supposed that our\r\nGeneral could pursue M. de la Mothe, or do much more than hold our\r\nground about the wood, from which the Frenchman had in vain attempted\r\nto dislodge us. La Mothe retired behind his forty guns, his cavalry\r\nprotecting them better than it had been enabled to annoy us; and\r\nmeanwhile the convoy, which was of more importance than all our little\r\nforce, and the safe passage of which we would have dropped to the last\r\nman to accomplish, marched away in perfect safety during the action, and\r\njoyfully reached the besieging camp before Lille.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Cadogan, my Lord Duke's Quarter-Master-General, (and\r\nbetween whom and Mr. Webb there was no love lost), accompanied the\r\nconvoy, and joined Mr. Webb with a couple of hundred horse just as the\r\nbattle was over, and the enemy in full retreat. He offered, readily\r\nenough, to charge with his horse upon the French as they fell back; but\r\nhis force was too weak to inflict any damage upon them; and Mr. Webb,\r\ncommanding as Cadogan's senior, thought enough was done in holding\r\nour ground before an enemy that might still have overwhelmed us had we\r\nengaged him in the open territory, and in securing the safe passage of\r\nthe convoy. Accordingly, the horse brought up by Cadogan did not draw\r\na sword; and only prevented, by the good countenance they showed, any\r\ndisposition the French might have had to renew the attack on us. And no\r\nattack coming, at nightfall General Cadogan drew off with his squadron,\r\nbeing bound for head-quarters, the two Generals at parting grimly\r\nsaluting each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be at Roncq time enough to lick my Lord Duke's trenchers at\r\nsupper,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Webb.\r\n\r\nOur own men lay out in the woods of Wynendael that night, and our\r\nGeneral had his supper in the little castle there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was Cadogan, I would have a peerage for this day's work,\xe2\x80\x9d General\r\nWebb said; \xe2\x80\x9cand, Harry, thou shouldst have a regiment. Thou hast been\r\nreported in the last two actions: thou wert near killed in the first. I\r\nshall mention thee in my despatch to his Grace the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nand recommend thee to poor Dick Harwood's vacant majority. Have you ever\r\na hundred guineas to give Cardonnel? Slip them into his hand to-morrow,\r\nwhen you go to head-quarters with my report.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this report the Major-General was good enough to mention Captain\r\nEsmond's name with particular favor; and that gentleman carried the\r\ndespatch to head-quarters the next day, and was not a little pleased\r\nto bring back a letter by his Grace's secretary, addressed to\r\nLieutenant-General Webb. The Dutch officer despatched by Count Nassau\r\nWoudenbourg, Vaelt-Mareschal Auverquerque's son, brought back also a\r\ncomplimentary letter to his commander, who had seconded Mr. Webb in the\r\naction with great valor and skill.\r\n\r\nEsmond, with a low bow and a smiling face, presented his despatch, and\r\nsaluted Mr. Webb as Lieutenant-General, as he gave it in. The gentlemen\r\nround about him--he was riding with his suite on the road to Menin as\r\nEsmond came up with him--gave a cheer, and he thanked them, and opened\r\nthe despatch with rather a flushed, eager face.\r\n\r\nHe slapped it down on his boot in a rage after he had read it. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis not\r\neven writ with his own hand. Read it out, Esmond.\xe2\x80\x9d And Esmond read it\r\nout:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSIR,--Mr. Cadogan is just now come in, and has acquainted me with the\r\nsuccess of the action you had yesterday in the afternoon against the\r\nbody of troops commanded by M. de la Mothe, at Wynendael, which must be\r\nattributed chiefly to your good conduct and resolution. You may be sure\r\nI shall do you justice at home, and be glad on all occasions to own the\r\nservice you have done in securing this convoy.--Yours, &c., M.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo lines by that d--d Cardonnel, and no more, for the taking of\r\nLille--for beating five times our number--for an action as brilliant\r\nas the best he ever fought,\xe2\x80\x9d says poor Mr. Webb. \xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant-General!\r\nThat's not his doing. I was the oldest major-general. By ----, I believe\r\nhe had been better pleased if I had been beat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter to the Dutch officer was in French, and longer and more\r\ncomplimentary than that to Mr. Webb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is the man,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cthat's gorged with gold--that's\r\ncovered with titles and honors that we won for him--and that grudges\r\neven a line of praise to a comrade in arms! Hasn't he enough? Don't\r\nwe fight that he may roll in riches? Well, well, wait for the Gazette,\r\ngentlemen. The Queen and the country will do us justice if his Grace\r\ndenies it us.\xe2\x80\x9d There were tears of rage in the brave warrior's eyes as\r\nhe spoke; and he dashed them off his face on to his glove. He shook his\r\nfist in the air. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I had rather\r\nhave than a peerage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d some of them asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had rather have a quarter of an hour with John Churchill, on a fair\r\ngreen field, and only a pair of rapiers between my shirt and his--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir!\xe2\x80\x9d interposes one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him so! I know that's what you mean. I know every word goes to him\r\nthat's dropped from every general officer's mouth. I don't say he's not\r\nbrave. Curse him! he's brave enough; but we'll wait for the Gazette,\r\ngentlemen. God save her Majesty! she'll do us justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Gazette did not come to us till a month afterwards; when my General\r\nand his officers had the honor to dine with Prince Eugene in Lille; his\r\nHighness being good enough to say that we had brought the provisions,\r\nand ought to share in the banquet. 'Twas a great banquet. His Grace of\r\nMarlborough was on his Highness's right, and on his left the Mareschal\r\nde Boufflers, who had so bravely defended the place. The chief officers\r\nof either army were present; and you may be sure Esmond's General was\r\nsplendid this day: his tall noble person, and manly beauty of face, made\r\nhim remarkable anywhere; he wore, for the first time, the star of the\r\nOrder of Generosity, that his Prussian Majesty had sent to him for\r\nhis victory. His Highness the Prince of Savoy called a toast to the\r\nconqueror of Wynendael. My Lord Duke drank it with rather a sickly\r\nsmile. The aides-de-camp were present: and Harry Esmond and his dear\r\nyoung lord were together, as they always strove to be when duty would\r\npermit: they were over against the table where the generals were, and\r\ncould see all that passed pretty well. Frank laughed at my Lord Duke's\r\nglum face: the affair of Wynendael, and the Captain-General's conduct to\r\nWebb, had been the talk of the whole army. When his Highness spoke, and\r\ngave--\xe2\x80\x9cLe vainqueur de Wynendael; son armee et sa victoire,\xe2\x80\x9d adding,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cqui nous font diner a Lille aujourd'huy\xe2\x80\x9d--there was a great cheer\r\nthrough the hall; for Mr. Webb's bravery, generosity, and very\r\nweaknesses of character caused him to be beloved in the army.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike Hector, handsome, and like Paris, brave!\xe2\x80\x9d whispers Frank\r\nCastlewood. \xe2\x80\x9cA Venus, an elderly Venus, couldn't refuse him a pippin.\r\nStand up, Harry. See, we are drinking the army of Wynendael. Ramillies\r\nis nothing to it. Huzzay! huzzay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this very time, and just after our General had made his\r\nacknowledgment, some one brought in an English Gazette--and was passing\r\nit from hand to hand down the table. Officers were eager enough to read\r\nit; mothers and sisters at home must have sickened over it. There scarce\r\ncame out a Gazette for six years that did not tell of some heroic death\r\nor some brilliant achievement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is--Action of Wynendael--here you are, General,\xe2\x80\x9d says Frank,\r\nseizing hold of the little dingy paper that soldiers love to read so;\r\nand, scrambling over from our bench, he went to where the General\r\nsat, who knew him, and had seen many a time at his table his laughing,\r\nhandsome face, which everybody loved who saw. The generals in their\r\ngreat perukes made way for him. He handed the paper over General Dohna's\r\nbuff-coat to our General on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nHe came hobbling back, and blushing at his feat: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he'd like\r\nit, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d the young fellow whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn't I like to read my name\r\nafter Ramillies, in the London Gazette?--Viscount Castlewood serving a\r\nvolunteer--I say, what's yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Webb, reading the Gazette, looked very strange--slapped it down\r\non the table--then sprang up in his place, and began to--\xe2\x80\x9cWill your\r\nHighness please to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis Grace the Duke of Marlborough here jumped up too--\xe2\x80\x9cThere's some\r\nmistake, my dear General Webb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace had better rectify it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Webb, holding out the\r\nletter; but he was five off his Grace the Prince Duke, who, besides,\r\nwas higher than the General (being seated with the Prince of Savoy,\r\nthe Electoral Prince of Hanover, and the envoys of Prussia and Denmark,\r\nunder a baldaquin), and Webb could not reach him, tall as he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, with a smile, as if catching at some idea, and then,\r\nwith a perfect courtesy, drawing his sword, he ran the Gazette through\r\nwith the point, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to hand it to your Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke looked very black. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, to his Master of the\r\nHorse, who was waiting behind him.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-General made a very low bow, and retired and finished his\r\nglass. The Gazette in which Mr. Cardonnel, the Duke's secretary, gave an\r\naccount of the victory of Wynendael, mentioned Mr. Webb's name, but gave\r\nthe sole praise and conduct of the action to the Duke's favorite, Mr.\r\nCadogan.\r\n\r\nThere was no little talk and excitement occasioned by this strange\r\nbehavior of General Webb, who had almost drawn a sword upon the\r\nCommander-in-Chief; but the General, after the first outbreak of\r\nhis anger, mastered it outwardly altogether; and, by his\r\nsubsequent behavior, had the satisfaction of even more angering the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, than he could have done by any public exhibition of\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\nOn returning to his quarters, and consulting with his chief adviser, Mr.\r\nEsmond, who was now entirely in the General's confidence, and treated by\r\nhim as a friend, and almost a son, Mr. Webb writ a letter to his Grace\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, in which he said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace must be aware that the sudden perusal of the London\r\nGazette, in which your Grace's secretary, Mr. Cardonnel, hath mentioned\r\nMajor-General Cadogan's name as the officer commanding in the late\r\naction of Wynendael, must have caused a feeling of anything but pleasure\r\nto the General who fought that action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace must be aware that Mr. Cadogan was not even present at the\r\nbattle, though he arrived with squadrons of horse at its close, and put\r\nhimself under the command of his superior officer. And as the result of\r\nthe battle of Wynendael, in which Lieutenant-General Webb had the good\r\nfortune to command, was the capture of Lille, the relief of Brussels,\r\nthen invested by the enemy under the Elector of Bavaria, the restoration\r\nof the great cities of Ghent and Bruges, of which the enemy (by treason\r\nwithin the walls) had got possession in the previous year, Mr. Webb\r\ncannot consent to forego the honors of such a success and service, for\r\nthe benefit of Mr. Cadogan, or any other person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as the military operations of the year are over,\r\nLieutenant-General Webb will request permission to leave the army, and\r\nreturn to his place in Parliament, where he gives notice to his Grace\r\nthe Commander-in Chief, that he shall lay his case before the House of\r\nCommons, the country, and her Majesty the Queen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy his eagerness to rectify that false statement of the Gazette, which\r\nhad been written by his Grace's secretary, Mr. Cardonnel, Mr. Webb, not\r\nbeing able to reach his Grace the Commander-in-Chief on account of the\r\ngentlemen seated between them, placed the paper containing the false\r\nstatement on his sword, so that it might more readily arrive in the\r\nhands of his Grace the Duke of Marlborough, who surely would wish to do\r\njustice to every officer of his army.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Webb knows his duty too well to think of insubordination to his\r\nsuperior officer, or of using his sword in a campaign against any but\r\nthe enemies of her Majesty. He solicits permission to return to England\r\nimmediately the military duties will permit, and take with him to\r\nEngland Captain Esmond, of his regiment, who acted as his aide-de-camp,\r\nand was present during the entire action, and noted by his watch the\r\ntime when Mr. Cadogan arrived at its close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief could not but grant this permission, nor could\r\nhe take notice of Webb's letter, though it was couched in terms the most\r\ninsulting. Half the army believed that the cities of Ghent and Bruges\r\nwere given up by a treason, which some in our army very well understood;\r\nthat the Commander-in-Chief would not have relieved Lille if he could\r\nhave helped himself; that he would not have fought that year had not the\r\nPrince of Savoy forced him. When the battle once began, then, for his\r\nown renown, my Lord Marlborough would fight as no man in the world ever\r\nfought better; and no bribe on earth could keep him from beating the\r\nenemy.*\r\n\r\n     * Our Grandfather's hatred of the Duke of Marlborough\r\n     appears all through his account of these campaigns.  He\r\n     always persisted that the Duke was the greatest traitor and\r\n     soldier history ever told of: and declared that he took\r\n     bribes on all hands during the war.  My Lord Marquis (for so\r\n     we may call him here, though he never went by any other name\r\n     than Colonel Esmond) was in the habit of telling many\r\n     stories which he did not set down in his memoirs, and which\r\n     he had from his friend the Jesuit, who was not always\r\n     correctly informed, and who persisted that Marlborough was\r\n     looking for a bribe of two millions of crowns before the\r\n     campaign of Ramillies.\r\n\r\n     And our Grandmother used to tell us children, that on his\r\n     first presentation to my Lord duke, the Duke turned his back\r\n     upon my Grandfather; and said to the Duchess, who told my\r\n     lady dowager at Chelsey, who afterwards told Colonel Esmond\r\n     --\xe2\x80\x9cTom Esmond's bastard has been to my levee: he has the\r\n     hang-dog look of his rogue of a father\xe2\x80\x9d--an expression which\r\n     my Grandfather never forgave.  He was as constant in his\r\n     dislikes as in his attachments; and exceedingly partial to\r\n     Webb, whose side he took against the more celebrated\r\n     general.  We have General Webb's portrait now at Castlewood,\r\n     Va.\r\n\r\nBut the matter was taken up by the subordinates; and half the army might\r\nhave been by the ears, if the quarrel had not been stopped. General\r\nCadogan sent an intimation to General Webb to say that he was ready if\r\nWebb liked, and would meet him. This was a kind of invitation our\r\nstout old general was always too ready to accept, and 'twas with great\r\ndifficulty we got the General to reply that he had no quarrel with Mr.\r\nCadogan, who had behaved with perfect gallantry, but only with those at\r\nhead-quarters, who had belied him. Mr. Cardonnel offered General Webb\r\nreparation; Mr. Webb said he had a cane at the service of Mr. Cardonnel,\r\nand the only satisfaction he wanted from him was one he was not likely\r\nto get, namely, the truth. The officers in our staff of Webb's, and\r\nthose in the immediate suite of the General, were ready to come to\r\nblows; and hence arose the only affair in which Mr. Esmond ever engaged\r\nas principal, and that was from a revengeful wish to wipe off an old\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mohun, who had a troop in Lord Macclesfield's regiment of the\r\nHorse Guards, rode this campaign with the Duke. He had sunk by this time\r\nto the very worst reputation; he had had another fatal duel in Spain; he\r\nhad married, and forsaken his wife; he was a gambler, a profligate, and\r\ndebauchee. He joined just before Oudenarde; and, as Esmond feared, as\r\nsoon as Frank Castlewood heard of his arrival, Frank was for seeking him\r\nout, and killing him. The wound my lord got at Oudenarde prevented their\r\nmeeting, but that was nearly healed, and Mr. Esmond trembled daily lest\r\nany chance should bring his boy and this known assassin together. They\r\nmet at the mess-table of Handyside's regiment at Lille; the officer\r\ncommanding not knowing of the feud between the two noblemen.\r\n\r\nEsmond had not seen the hateful handsome face of Mohun for nine years,\r\nsince they had met on that fatal night in Leicester Field. It was\r\ndegraded with crime and passion now; it wore the anxious look of a man\r\nwho has three deaths, and who knows how many hidden shames, and lusts,\r\nand crimes on his conscience. He bowed with a sickly low bow, and slunk\r\naway when our host presented us round to one another. Frank Castlewood\r\nhad not known him till then, so changed was he. He knew the boy well\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n'Twas curious to look at the two--especially the young man, whose face\r\nflushed up when he heard the hated name of the other; and who said in\r\nhis bad French and his brave boyish voice--\xe2\x80\x9cHe had long been anxious to\r\nmeet my Lord Mohun.\xe2\x80\x9d The other only bowed, and moved away from him. I do\r\nhim justice, he wished to have no quarrel with the lad.\r\n\r\nEsmond put himself between them at table. \xe2\x80\x9cD--- it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Frank, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\ndo you put yourself in the place of a man who is above you in degree? My\r\nLord Mohun should walk after me. I want to sit by my Lord Mohun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond whispered to Lord Mohun, that Frank was hurt in the leg at\r\nOudenarde; and besought the other to be quiet. Quiet enough he was for\r\nsome time; disregarding the many taunts which young Castlewood flung at\r\nhim, until after several healths, when my Lord Mohun got to be rather in\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go away, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Esmond said to him, imploring him to\r\nquit the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, by G--,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Mohun. \xe2\x80\x9cI'll not go away for any man;\xe2\x80\x9d he was\r\nquite flushed with wine by this time.\r\n\r\nThe talk got round to the affairs of yesterday. Webb had offered to\r\nchallenge the Commander-in-Chief: Webb had been ill-used: Webb was the\r\nbravest, handsomest, vainest man in the army. Lord Mohun did not know\r\nthat Esmond was Webb's aide-de-camp. He began to tell some stories\r\nagainst the General; which, from t'other side of Esmond, young\r\nCastlewood contradicted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't bear any more of this,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lord Mohun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor can I, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond, starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cThe story my Lord\r\nMohun has told respecting General Webb is false, gentlemen--false, I\r\nrepeat,\xe2\x80\x9d and making a low bow to Lord Mohun, and without a single word\r\nmore, Esmond got up and left the dining-room. These affairs were common\r\nenough among the military of those days. There was a garden behind\r\nthe house, and all the party turned instantly into it; and the two\r\ngentlemen's coats were off and their points engaged within two minutes\r\nafter Esmond's words had been spoken. If Captain Esmond had put Mohun\r\nout of the world, as he might, a villain would have been punished\r\nand spared further villanies--but who is one man to punish another? I\r\ndeclare upon my honor that my only thought was to prevent Lord Mohun\r\nfrom mischief with Frank, and the end of this meeting was, that after\r\nhalf a dozen passes my lord went home with a hurt which prevented him\r\nfrom lifting his right arm for three months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Harry! why didn't you kill the villain?\xe2\x80\x9d young Castlewood asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan't walk without a crutch: but I could have met him on horseback with\r\nsword and pistol.\xe2\x80\x9d But Harry Esmond said, \xe2\x80\x9c'Twas best to have no man's\r\nlife on one's conscience, not even that villain's.\xe2\x80\x9d And this affair,\r\nwhich did not occupy three minutes, being over, the gentlemen went back\r\nto their wine, and my Lord Mohun to his quarters, where he was laid up\r\nwith a fever which had spared mischief had it proved fatal. And very\r\nsoon after this affair Harry Esmond and his General left the camp for\r\nLondon; whither a certain reputation had preceded the Captain, for my\r\nLady Castlewood of Chelsey received him as if he had been a conquering\r\nhero. She gave a great dinner to Mr. Webb, where the General's chair\r\nwas crowned with laurels; and her ladyship called Esmond's health in\r\na toast, to which my kind General was graciously pleased to bear the\r\nstrongest testimony: and took down a mob of at least forty coaches to\r\ncheer our General as he came out of the House of Commons, the day when\r\nhe received the thanks of Parliament for his action. The mob huzza'd and\r\napplauded him, as well as the fine company: it was splendid to see\r\nhim waving his hat, and bowing, and laying his hand upon his Order\r\nof Generosity. He introduced Mr. Esmond to Mr. St. John and the Right\r\nHonorable Robert Harley, Esquire, as he came out of the House walking\r\nbetween them; and was pleased to make many flattering observations\r\nregarding Mr. Esmond's behavior during the three last campaigns.\r\n\r\nMr. St. John (who had the most winning presence of any man I ever saw,\r\nexcepting always my peerless young Frank Castlewood) said he had heard\r\nof Mr. Esmond before from Captain Steele, and how he had helped Mr.\r\nAddison to write his famous poem of the \xe2\x80\x9cCampaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Twas as great an achievement as the victory of Blenheim itself,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nHarley said, who was famous as a judge and patron of letters, and\r\nso, perhaps, it may be--though for my part I think there are twenty\r\nbeautiful lines, but all the rest is commonplace, and Mr. Addison's hymn\r\nworth a thousand such poems.\r\n\r\nAll the town was indignant at my Lord Duke's unjust treatment of General\r\nWebb, and applauded the vote of thanks which the House of Commons gave\r\nto the General for his victory at Wynendael. 'Tis certain that the\r\ncapture of Lille was the consequence of that lucky achievement, and the\r\nhumiliation of the old French King, who was said to suffer more at\r\nthe loss of this great city, than from any of the former victories\r\nour troops had won over him. And, I think, no small part of Mr. Webb's\r\nexultation at his victory arose from the idea that Marlborough had been\r\ndisappointed of a great bribe the French King had promised him, should\r\nthe siege be raised. The very sum of money offered to him was mentioned\r\nby the Duke's enemies; and honest Mr. Webb chuckled at the notion,\r\nnot only of beating the French, but of beating Marlborough too, and\r\nintercepting a convoy of three millions of French crowns, that were on\r\ntheir way to the Generalissimo's insatiable pockets. When the General's\r\nlady went to the Queen's drawing-room, all the Tory women crowded round\r\nher with congratulations, and made her a train greater than the Duchess\r\nof Marlborough's own. Feasts were given to the General by all the chiefs\r\nof the Tory party, who vaunted him as the Duke's equal in military\r\nskill; and perhaps used the worthy soldier as their instrument, whilst\r\nhe thought they were but acknowledging his merits as a commander. As the\r\nGeneral's aide-de-camp and favorite officer, Mr. Esmond came in for a\r\nshare of his chief's popularity, and was presented to her Majesty,\r\nand advanced to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, at the request of his\r\ngrateful chief.\r\n\r\nWe may be sure there was one family in which any good fortune that\r\nhappened to Esmond caused such a sincere pride and pleasure, that he,\r\nfor his part, was thankful he could make them so happy. With these fond\r\nfriends, Blenheim and Oudenarde seemed to be mere trifling incidents of\r\nthe war; and Wynendael was its crowning victory. Esmond's mistress never\r\ntired to hear accounts of the battle; and I think General Webb's lady\r\ngrew jealous of her, for the General was for ever at Kensington, and\r\ntalking on that delightful theme. As for his aide-de-camp, though, no\r\ndoubt, Esmond's own natural vanity was pleased at the little share\r\nof reputation which his good fortune had won him, yet it was chiefly\r\nprecious to him (he may say so, now that he hath long since outlived\r\nit,) because it pleased his mistress, and, above all, because Beatrix\r\nvalued it.\r\n\r\nAs for the old Dowager of Chelsey, never was an old woman in all England\r\nmore delighted nor more gracious than she. Esmond had his quarters in\r\nher ladyship's house, where the domestics were instructed to consider\r\nhim as their master. She bade him give entertainments, of which she\r\ndefrayed the charges, and was charmed when his guests were carried away\r\ntipsy in their coaches. She must have his picture taken; and accordingly\r\nhe was painted by Mr. Jervas, in his red coat, and smiling upon a\r\nbomb-shell, which was bursting at the corner of the piece. She vowed\r\nthat unless he made a great match, she should never die easy, and was\r\nfor ever bringing young ladies to Chelsey, with pretty faces and pretty\r\nfortunes, at the disposal of the Colonel. He smiled to think how times\r\nwere altered with him, and of the early days in his father's lifetime,\r\nwhen a trembling page he stood before her, with her ladyship's basin and\r\newer, or crouched in her coach-step. The only fault she found with\r\nhim was, that he was more sober than an Esmond ought to be; and would\r\nneither be carried to bed by his valet, nor lose his heart to any\r\nbeauty, whether of St. James's or Covent Garden.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of fidelity in love, and whence the birth of it?\r\n'Tis a state of mind that men fall into, and depending on the man rather\r\nthan the woman. We love being in love, that's the truth on't. If we\r\nhad not met Joan, we should have met Kate, and adored her. We know our\r\nmistresses are no better than many other women, nor no prettier, nor no\r\nwiser, nor no wittier. 'Tis not for these reasons we love a woman, or\r\nfor any special quality or charm I know of; we might as well demand that\r\na lady should be the tallest woman in the world, like the Shropshire\r\ngiantess,* as that she should be a paragon in any other character,\r\nbefore we began to love her. Esmond's mistress had a thousand faults\r\nbeside her charms; he knew both perfectly well! She was imperious, she\r\nwas light-minded, she was flighty, she was false, she had no reverence\r\nin her character; she was in everything, even in beauty, the contrast\r\nof her mother, who was the most devoted and the least selfish of women.\r\nWell, from the very first moment he saw her on the stairs at Walcote,\r\nEsmond knew he loved Beatrix. There might be better women--he wanted\r\nthat one. He cared for none other. Was it because she was gloriously\r\nbeautiful? Beautiful as she was, he had heard people say a score of\r\ntimes in their company that Beatrix's mother looked as young, and was\r\nthe handsomer of the two. Why did her voice thrill in his ear so? She\r\ncould not sing near so well as Nicolini or Mrs. Tofts; nay, she sang out\r\nof tune, and yet he liked to hear her better than St. Cecilia. She had\r\nnot a finer complexion than Mrs. Steele, (Dick's wife, whom he had now\r\ngot, and who ruled poor Dick with a rod of pickle,) and yet to see her\r\ndazzled Esmond; he would shut his eyes, and the thought of her dazzled\r\nhim all the same. She was brilliant and lively in talk, but not so\r\nincomparably witty as her mother, who, when she was cheerful, said the\r\nfinest things; but yet to hear her, and to be with her, was Esmond's\r\ngreatest pleasure. Days passed away between him and these ladies, he\r\nscarce knew how. He poured his heart out to them, so as he never could\r\nin any other company, where he hath generally passed for being moody, or\r\nsupercilious and silent. This society** was more delightful than that\r\nof the greatest wits to him. May heaven pardon him the lies he told\r\nthe Dowager at Chelsey, in order to get a pretext for going away\r\nto Kensington: the business at the Ordnance which he invented; the\r\ninterview with his General, the courts and statesmen's levees which\r\nhe DIDN'T frequent and describe; who wore a new suit on Sunday at St.\r\nJames's or at the Queen's birthday; how many coaches filled the street\r\nat Mr. Harley's levee; how many bottles he had had the honor to drink\r\nover-night with Mr. St. John at the \xe2\x80\x9cCocoa-Tree,\xe2\x80\x9d or at the \xe2\x80\x9cGarter\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n with Mr. Walpole and Mr. Steele.\r\n\r\n     * 'Tis not thus WOMAN LOVES: Col. E. hath owned to this\r\n     folly for a SCORE OF WOMEN besides.--R.\r\n\r\n     ** And, indeed, so was his to them, a thousand thousand\r\n     times more charming, for where was his equal?--R.\r\n\r\nMistress Beatrix Esmond had been a dozen times on the point of making\r\ngreat matches, so the Court scandal said; but for his part Esmond never\r\nwould believe the stories against her; and came back, after three years'\r\nabsence from her, not so frantic as he had been perhaps, but still\r\nhungering after her and no other; still hopeful, still kneeling, with\r\nhis heart in his hand for the young lady to take. We were now got to\r\n1709. She was near twenty-two years old, and three years at Court, and\r\nwithout a husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis not for want of being asked,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Castlewood said, looking into\r\nEsmond's heart, as she could, with that perceptiveness affection gives.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she will make no mean match, Harry: she will not marry as I would\r\nhave her; the person whom I should like to call my son, and Henry Esmond\r\nknows who that is, is best served by my not pressing his claim. Beatrix\r\nis so wilful, that what I would urge on her, she would be sure to\r\nresist. The man who would marry her, will not be happy with her, unless\r\nhe be a great person, and can put her in a great position. Beatrix loves\r\nadmiration more than love; and longs, beyond all things, for command.\r\nWhy should a mother speak so of her child? You are my son, too, Harry.\r\nYou should know the truth about your sister. I thought you might cure\r\nyourself of your passion,\xe2\x80\x9d my lady added, fondly. \xe2\x80\x9cOther people can\r\ncure themselves of that folly, you know. But I see you are still as\r\ninfatuated as ever. When we read your name in the Gazette, I pleaded\r\nfor you, my poor boy. Poor boy, indeed! You are growing a grave old\r\ngentleman, now, and I am an old woman. She likes your fame well\r\nenough, and she likes your person. She says you have wit, and fire,\r\nand good-breeding, and are more natural than the fine gentlemen of the\r\nCourt. But this is not enough. She wants a commander-in-chief, and not\r\na colonel. Were a duke to ask her, she would leave an earl whom she\r\nhad promised. I told you so before. I know not how my poor girl is so\r\nworldly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9ca man can but give his best and his all. She has\r\nthat from me. What little reputation I have won, I swear I cared for it\r\nbecause I thought Beatrix would be pleased with it. What care I to be a\r\ncolonel or a general? Think you 'twill matter a few score years hence,\r\nwhat our foolish honors to-day are? I would have had a little fame, that\r\nshe might wear it in her hat. If I had anything better, I would endow\r\nher with it. If she wants my life, I would give it her. If she marries\r\nanother, I will say God bless him. I make no boast, nor no complaint. I\r\nthink my fidelity is folly, perhaps. But so it is. I cannot help myself.\r\nI love her. You are a thousand times better: the fondest, the fairest,\r\nthe dearest of women. Sure, my dear lady, I see all Beatrix's faults as\r\nwell as you do. But she is my fate. 'Tis endurable. I shall not die\r\nfor not having her. I think I should be no happier if I won her. Que\r\nvoulez-vous? as my Lady of Chelsey would say. Je l'aime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish she would have you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry's fond mistress, giving a hand\r\nto him. He kissed the fair hand ['twas the prettiest dimpled little hand\r\nin the world, and my Lady Castlewood, though now almost forty years old,\r\ndid not look to be within ten years of her age). He kissed and kept her\r\nfair hand, as they talked together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cshould she hear me? She knows what I would say. Far or\r\nnear, she knows I'm her slave. I have sold myself for nothing, it may\r\nbe. Well, 'tis the price I choose to take. I am worth nothing, or I am\r\nworth all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are such a treasure,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond's mistress was pleased to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthe woman who has your love, shouldn't change it away against a kingdom,\r\nI think. I am a country-bred woman, and cannot say but the ambitions of\r\nthe town seem mean to me. I never was awe-stricken by my Lady Duchess's\r\nrank and finery, or afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a sly laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cof anything\r\nbut her temper. I hear of Court ladies who pine because her Majesty\r\nlooks cold on them; and great noblemen who would give a limb that\r\nthey might wear a garter on the other. This worldliness, which I can't\r\ncomprehend, was born with Beatrix, who, on the first day of her waiting,\r\nwas a perfect courtier. We are like sisters, and she the eldest sister,\r\nsomehow. She tells me I have a mean spirit. I laugh, and say she adores\r\na coach-and-six. I cannot reason her out of her ambition. 'Tis natural\r\nto her, as to me to love quiet, and be indifferent about rank and\r\nriches. What are they, Harry? and for how long do they last? Our home\r\nis not here.\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled as she spoke, and looked like an angel that was\r\nonly on earth on a visit. \xe2\x80\x9cOur home is where the just are, and where our\r\nsins and sorrows enter not. My father used to rebuke me, and say that\r\nI was too hopeful about heaven. But I cannot help my nature, and grow\r\nobstinate as I grow to be an old woman; and as I love my children so,\r\nsure our Father loves us with a thousand and a thousand times greater\r\nlove. It must be that we shall meet yonder, and be happy. Yes, you--and\r\nmy children, and my dear lord. Do you know, Harry, since his death, it\r\nhas always seemed to me as if his love came back to me, and that we are\r\nparted no more. Perhaps he is here now, Harry--I think he is. Forgiven\r\nI am sure he is: even Mr. Atterbury absolved him, and he died forgiving.\r\nOh, what a noble heart he had! How generous he was! I was but fifteen\r\nand a child when he married me. How good he was to stoop to me! He was\r\nalways good to the poor and humble.\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, then presently, with a\r\npeculiar expression, as if her eyes were looking into heaven, and saw\r\nmy lord there, she smiled, and gave a little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI laugh to see you,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d she says; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you come, it seems as if you never were away.\xe2\x80\x9d One\r\nmay put her words down, and remember them, but how describe her sweet\r\ntones, sweeter than music!\r\n\r\nMy young lord did not come home at the end of the campaign, and wrote\r\nthat he was kept at Bruxelles on military duty. Indeed, I believe he\r\nwas engaged in laying siege to a certain lady, who was of the suite of\r\nMadame de Soissons, the Prince of Savoy's mother, who was just dead, and\r\nwho, like the Flemish fortresses, was taken and retaken a great\r\nnumber of times during the war, and occupied by French, English, and\r\nImperialists. Of course, Mr. Esmond did not think fit to enlighten Lady\r\nCastlewood regarding the young scapegrace's doings: nor had he said a\r\nword about the affair with Lord Mohun, knowing how abhorrent that man's\r\nname was to his mistress. Frank did not waste much time or money on pen\r\nand ink; and, when Harry came home with his General, only writ two lines\r\nto his mother, to say his wound in the leg was almost healed, that he\r\nwould keep his coming of age next year--that the duty aforesaid would\r\nkeep him at Bruxelles, and that Cousin Harry would tell all the news.\r\n\r\nBut from Bruxelles, knowing how the Lady Castlewood always liked to have\r\na letter about the famous 29th of December, my lord writ her a long and\r\nfull one, and in this he must have described the affair with Mohun; for\r\nwhen Mr. Esmond came to visit his mistress one day, early in the new\r\nyear, to his great wonderment, she and her daughter both came up and\r\nsaluted him, and after them the Dowager of Chelsey, too, whose chairman\r\nhad just brought her ladyship from her village to Kensington across the\r\nfields. After this honor, I say, from the two ladies of Castlewood, the\r\nDowager came forward in great state, with her grand tall head-dress of\r\nKing James's reign, that, she never forsook, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCousin Henry,\r\nall our family have met; and we thank you, cousin, for your noble\r\nconduct towards the head of our house.\xe2\x80\x9d And pointing to her blushing\r\ncheek, she made Mr. Esmond aware that he was to enjoy the rapture of an\r\nembrace there. Having saluted one cheek, she turned to him the other.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d said both the other ladies, in a little chorus, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nthank you for your noble conduct;\xe2\x80\x9d and then Harry became aware that the\r\nstory of the Lille affair had come to his kinswomen's ears. It pleased\r\nhim to hear them all saluting him as one of their family.\r\n\r\nThe tables of the dining-room were laid for a great entertainment; and\r\nthe ladies were in gala dresses--my Lady of Chelsey in her highest tour,\r\nmy Lady Viscountess out of black, and looking fair and happy a ravir;\r\nand the Maid of Honor attired with that splendor which naturally\r\ndistinguished her, and wearing on her beautiful breast the French\r\nofficer's star which Frank had sent home after Ramillies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, 'tis a gala day with us,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, glancing down to the star\r\ncomplacently, \xe2\x80\x9cand we have our orders on. Does not mamma look charming?\r\n'Twas I dressed her!\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, Esmond's dear mistress, blushing as\r\nhe looked at her, with her beautiful fair hair, and an elegant dress\r\naccording to the mode, appeared to have the shape and complexion of a\r\ngirl of twenty.\r\n\r\nOn the table was a fine sword, with a red velvet scabbard, and a\r\nbeautiful chased silver handle, with a blue ribbon for a sword-knot.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain, going up to look at this pretty piece.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beatrix advanced towards it. \xe2\x80\x9cKneel down,\xe2\x80\x9d says she: \xe2\x80\x9cwe dub you\r\nour knight with this\xe2\x80\x9d--and she waved the sword over his head. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lady\r\nDowager hath given the sword; and I give the ribbon, and mamma hath sewn\r\non the fringe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the sword on him, Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d says her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are our knight,\r\nHarry--our true knight. Take a mother's thanks and prayers for defending\r\nher son, my dear, dear friend.\xe2\x80\x9d She could say no more, and even the\r\nDowager was affected, for a couple of rebellious tears made sad marks\r\ndown those wrinkled old roses which Esmond had just been allowed to\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a letter from dearest Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cthree days\r\nsince, whilst you were on your visit to your friend Captain Steele, at\r\nHampton. He told us all that you had done, and how nobly you had put\r\nyourself between him and that--that wretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I adopt you from this day,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Dowager, \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish I was\r\nricher, for your sake, son Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a wave of her hand;\r\nand as Mr. Esmond dutifully went down on his knee before her ladyship,\r\nshe cast her eyes up to the ceiling, (the gilt chandelier, and the\r\ntwelve wax-candles in it, for the party was numerous,) and invoked a\r\nblessing from that quarter upon the newly adopted son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other viscountess, \xe2\x80\x9chow fond he is of his\r\nmilitary profession! He is studying fortification very hard. I wish he\r\nwere here. We shall keep his coming of age at Castlewood next year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the campaign permit us,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am never afraid when he is with you,\xe2\x80\x9d cries the boy's mother. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsure my Henry will always defend him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there will be a peace before next year; we know it for certain,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cries the Maid of Honor. \xe2\x80\x9cLord Marlborough will be dismissed, and that\r\nhorrible duchess turned out of all her places. Her Majesty won't speak\r\nto her now. Did you see her at Bushy, Harry? She is furious, and she\r\nranges about the park like a lioness, and tears people's eyes out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Princess Anne will send for somebody,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lady of Chelsey,\r\ntaking out her medal and kissing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see the King at Oudenarde, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d his mistress asked. She was\r\na staunch Jacobite, and would no more have thought of denying her king\r\nthan her God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the young Hanoverian only,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King, sir, the King!\xe2\x80\x9d said the ladies and Miss Beatrix; and she\r\nclapped her pretty hands, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cVive le Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time there came a thundering knock, that drove in the doors of\r\nthe house almost. It was three o'clock, and the company were arriving;\r\nand presently the servant announced Captain Steele and his lady.\r\n\r\nCaptain and Mrs. Steele, who were the first to arrive, had driven to\r\nKensington from their country-house, the Hovel at Hampton Wick. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\nfrom our mansion in Bloomsbury Square,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mrs. Steele took care to\r\ninform the ladies. Indeed Harry had ridden away from Hampton that very\r\nmorning, leaving the couple by the ears; for from the chamber where\r\nhe lay, in a bed that was none of the cleanest, and kept awake by the\r\ncompany which he had in his own bed, and the quarrel which was going\r\non in the next room, he could hear both night and morning the curtain\r\nlecture which Mrs. Steele was in the habit of administering to poor\r\nDick.\r\n\r\nAt night it did not matter so much for the culprit; Dick was fuddled,\r\nand when in that way no scolding could interrupt his benevolence. Mr.\r\nEsmond could hear him coaxing and speaking in that maudlin manner, which\r\npunch and claret produce, to his beloved Prue, and beseeching her to\r\nremember that there was a distiwisht officer ithe rex roob, who would\r\noverhear her. She went on, nevertheless, calling him a drunken wretch,\r\nand was only interrupted in her harangues by the Captain's snoring.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, the unhappy victim awoke to a headache, and\r\nconsciousness, and the dialogue of the night was resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you\r\nbring captains home to dinner when there's not a guinea in the house?\r\nHow am I to give dinners when you leave me without a shilling? How am\r\nI to go traipsing to Kensington in my yellow satin sack before all the\r\nfine company? I've nothing fit to put on; I never have:\xe2\x80\x9d and so the\r\ndispute went on--Mr. Esmond interrupting the talk when it seemed to be\r\ngrowing too intimate by blowing his nose as loudly as ever he could,\r\nat the sound of which trumpet there came a lull. But Dick was charming,\r\nthough his wife was odious, and 'twas to give Mr. Steele pleasure, that\r\nthe ladies of Castlewood, who were ladies of no small fashion, invited\r\nMrs. Steele.\r\n\r\nBesides the Captain and his lady, there was a great and notable\r\nassemblage of company: my Lady of Chelsey having sent her lackeys\r\nand liveries to aid the modest attendance at Kensington. There was\r\nLieutenant-General Webb, Harry's kind patron, of whom the Dowager\r\ntook possession, and who resplended in velvet and gold lace; there was\r\nHarry's new acquaintance, the Right Honorable Henry St. John, Esquire,\r\nthe General's kinsman, who was charmed with the Lady Castlewood, even\r\nmore than with her daughter; there was one of the greatest noblemen in\r\nthe kingdom, the Scots Duke of Hamilton, just created Duke of Brandon\r\nin England; and two other noble lords of the Tory party, my Lord\r\nAshburnham, and another I have forgot; and for ladies, her Grace the\r\nDuchess of Ormonde and her daughters, the Lady Mary and the Lady Betty,\r\nthe former one of Mistress Beatrix's colleagues in waiting on the Queen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a party of Tories!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Captain Steele to Esmond, as we were\r\nassembled in the parlor before dinner. Indeed, all the company present,\r\nsave Steele, were of that faction.\r\n\r\nMr. St. John made his special compliments to Mrs. Steele, and so charmed\r\nher that she declared she would have Steele a Tory too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr will you have me a Whig?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. St. John. \xe2\x80\x9cI think, madam, you\r\ncould convert a man to anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. St. John ever comes to Bloomsbury Square I will teach him what\r\nI know,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Steele, dropping her handsome eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know\r\nBloomsbury Square?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I know the Mall? Do I know the Opera? Do I know the reigning toast?\r\nWhy, Bloomsbury is the very height of the mode,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. St. John.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis rus in urbe. You have gardens all the way to Hampstead, and\r\npalaces round about you--Southampton House and Montague House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you wretches go and fight duels,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Mrs. Steele.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf which the ladies are the cause!\xe2\x80\x9d says her entertainer. \xe2\x80\x9cMadam, is\r\nDick a good swordsman? How charming the 'Tatler' is! We all recognized\r\nyour portrait in the 49th number, and I have been dying to know you\r\never since I read it. 'Aspasia must be allowed to be the first of\r\nthe beauteous order of love.' Doth not the passage run so? 'In this\r\naccomplished lady love is the constant effect, though it is never the\r\ndesign; yet though her mien carries much more invitation than command,\r\nto behold her is an immediate check to loose behavior, and to love her\r\nis a liberal education.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Steele, who did not seem to understand a word of\r\nwhat the gentleman was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho could fail to be accomplished under such a mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. St.\r\nJohn, still gallant and bowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistress! upon my word, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean me, sir, I\r\nwould have you know that I am the Captain's wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure we all know it,\xe2\x80\x9d answers Mr. St. John, keeping his countenance\r\nvery gravely; and Steele broke in saying, \xe2\x80\x9c'Twas not about Mrs. Steele I\r\nwrit that paper--though I am sure she is worthy of any compliment I can\r\npay her--but of the Lady Elizabeth Hastings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear Mr. Addison is equally famous as a wit and a poet,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr.\r\nSt. John. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it true that his hand is to be found in your 'Tatler,' Mr.\r\nSteele?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether 'tis the sublime or the humorous, no man can come near him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cries Steele.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fig, Dick, for your Mr. Addison!\xe2\x80\x9d cries out his lady: \xe2\x80\x9ca gentleman\r\nwho gives himself such airs and holds his head so high now. I hope your\r\nladyship thinks as I do: I can't bear those very fair men with white\r\neyelashes--a black man for me.\xe2\x80\x9d (All the black men at table applauded,\r\nand made Mrs. Steele a bow for this compliment.) \xe2\x80\x9cAs for this Mr.\r\nAddison,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9che comes to dine with the Captain sometimes,\r\nnever says a word to me, and then they walk up stairs both tipsy, to a\r\ndish of tea. I remember your Mr. Addison when he had but one coat to his\r\nback, and that with a patch at the elbow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed--a patch at the elbow! You interest me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. St. John.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis charming to hear of one man of letters from the charming wife of\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, I could tell you ever so much about 'em,\xe2\x80\x9d continues the voluble\r\nlady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think the Captain has got now?--a little hunchback\r\nfellow--a little hop-o'-my-thumb creature that he calls a poet--a little\r\nPopish brat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, there are two in the room,\xe2\x80\x9d whispers her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I call him Popish because his name is Pope,\xe2\x80\x9d says the lady.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis only my joking way. And this little dwarf of a fellow has wrote a\r\npastoral poem--all about shepherds and shepherdesses, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA shepherd should have a little crook,\xe2\x80\x9d says my mistress, laughing from\r\nher end of the table: on which Mrs. Steele said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe did not know, but\r\nthe Captain brought home this queer little creature when she was in bed\r\nwith her first boy, and it was a mercy he had come no sooner; and Dick\r\nraved about his genus, and was always raving about some nonsense or\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of the 'Tatlers' do you prefer, Mrs. Steele?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. St. John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never read but one, and think it all a pack of rubbish, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nthe lady. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch stuff about Bickerstaffe, and Distaff, and Quarterstaff,\r\nas it all is! There's the Captain going on still with the Burgundy--I\r\nknow he'll be tipsy before he stops--Captain Steele!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drink to your eyes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Captain, who seemed to think\r\nhis wife charming, and to receive as genuine all the satiric compliments\r\nwhich Mr. St. John paid her.\r\n\r\nAll this while the Maid of Honor had been trying to get Mr. Esmond to\r\ntalk, and no doubt voted him a dull fellow. For, by some mistake, just\r\nas he was going to pop into the vacant place, he was placed far away\r\nfrom Beatrix's chair, who sat between his Grace and my Lord Ashburnham,\r\nand shrugged her lovely white shoulders, and cast a look as if to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity me,\xe2\x80\x9d to her cousin. My Lord Duke and his young neighbor were\r\npresently in a very animated and close conversation. Mrs. Beatrix could\r\nno more help using her eyes than the sun can help shining, and setting\r\nthose it shines on a-burning. By the time the first course was done the\r\ndinner seemed long to Esmond; by the time the soup came he fancied they\r\nmust have been hours at table: and as for the sweets and jellies he\r\nthought they never would be done.\r\n\r\nAt length the ladies rose, Beatrix throwing a Parthian glance at her\r\nduke as she retreated; a fresh bottle and glasses were fetched, and\r\ntoasts were called. Mr. St. John asked his Grace the Duke of Hamilton\r\nand the company to drink to the health of his Grace the Duke of Brandon.\r\nAnother lord gave General Webb's health, \xe2\x80\x9cand may he get the command the\r\nbravest officer in the world deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Webb thanked the company,\r\ncomplimented his aide-de-camp, and fought his famous battle over again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIl est fatiguant,\xe2\x80\x9d whispers Mr. St. John, \xe2\x80\x9cavec sa trompette de\r\nWynendael.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Steele, who was not of our side, loyally gave the health of the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, the greatest general of the age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drink to the greatest general with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Webb;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere can be no gainsaying that character of him. My glass goes to the\r\nGeneral, and not to the Duke, Mr. Steele.\xe2\x80\x9d And the stout old gentleman\r\nemptied his bumper; to which Dick replied by filling and emptying a pair\r\nof brimmers, one for the General and one for the Duke.\r\n\r\nAnd now his Grace of Hamilton, rising up with flashing eyes (we had all\r\nbeen drinking pretty freely), proposed a toast to the lovely, to the\r\nincomparable Mrs. Beatrix Esmond; we all drank it with cheers, and my\r\nLord Ashburnham especially, with a shout of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity there is a Duchess of Hamilton,\xe2\x80\x9d whispers St. John, who\r\ndrank more wine and yet was more steady than most of the others, and we\r\nentered the drawing-room where the ladies were at their tea. As for poor\r\nDick, we were obliged to leave him alone at the dining-table, where he\r\nwas hiccupping out the lines from the \xe2\x80\x9cCampaign,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the greatest\r\npoet had celebrated the greatest general in the world; and Harry Esmond\r\nfound him, half an hour afterwards, in a more advanced stage of liquor,\r\nand weeping about the treachery of Tom Boxer.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was all dark to poor Harry, in spite of the grand\r\nillumination. Beatrix scarce spoke to him. When my Lord Duke went away,\r\nshe practised upon the next in rank, and plied my young Lord Ashburnham\r\nwith all the fire of her eyes and the fascinations of her wit. Most of\r\nthe party were set to cards, and Mr. St. John, after yawning in the face\r\nof Mrs. Steele, whom he did not care to pursue any more; and talking in\r\nhis most brilliant animated way to Lady Castlewood, whom he pronounced\r\nto be beautiful, of a far higher order of beauty than her daughter,\r\npresently took his leave, and went his way. The rest of the company\r\nspeedily followed, my Lord Ashburnham the last, throwing fiery glances\r\nat the smiling young temptress, who had bewitched more hearts than his\r\nin her thrall.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, as a kinsman of the house, Mr. Esmond thought fit to be the\r\nlast of all in it; he remained after the coaches had rolled away--after\r\nhis dowager aunt's chair and flambeaux had marched off in the darkness\r\ntowards Chelsey, and the town's people had gone to bed, who had been\r\ndrawn into the square to gape at the unusual assemblage of chairs and\r\nchariots, lackeys, and torchmen. The poor mean wretch lingered yet for\r\na few minutes, to see whether the girl would vouchsafe him a smile, or a\r\nparting word of consolation. But her enthusiasm of the morning was quite\r\ndied out, or she chose to be in a different mood. She fell to joking\r\nabout the dowdy appearance of Lady Betty, and mimicked the vulgarity\r\nof Mrs. Steele; and then she put up her little hand to her mouth and\r\nyawned, lighted a taper, and shrugged her shoulders, and dropping Mr.\r\nEsmond a saucy curtsy, sailed off to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day began so well, Henry, that I hoped it might have ended better,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was all the consolation that poor Esmond's fond mistress could give him;\r\nand as he trudged home through the dark alone, he thought with bitter\r\nrage in his heart, and a feeling of almost revolt against the sacrifice\r\nhe had made:--\xe2\x80\x9cShe would have me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9chad I but a name to\r\ngive her. But for my promise to her father, I might have my rank and my\r\nmistress too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI suppose a man's vanity is stronger than any other passion in him; for\r\nI blush, even now, as I recall the humiliation of those distant days,\r\nthe memory of which still smarts, though the fever of balked desire\r\nhas passed away more than a score of years ago. When the writer's\r\ndescendants come to read this memoir, I wonder will they have lived to\r\nexperience a similar defeat and shame? Will they ever have knelt to a\r\nwoman who has listened to them, and played with them, and laughed with\r\nthem--who beckoning them with lures and caresses, and with Yes smiling\r\nfrom her eyes, has tricked them on to their knees, and turned her\r\nback and left them. All this shame Mr. Esmond had to undergo; and he\r\nsubmitted, and revolted, and presently came crouching back for more.\r\n\r\nAfter this feste, my young Lord Ashburnham's coach was for ever rolling\r\nin and out of Kensington Square; his lady-mother came to visit Esmond's\r\nmistress, and at every assembly in the town, wherever the Maid of Honor\r\nmade her appearance, you might be pretty sure to see the young gentleman\r\nin a new suit every week, and decked out in all the finery that his\r\ntailor or embroiderer could furnish for him. My lord was for ever paying\r\nMr. Esmond compliments: bidding him to dinner, offering him horses to\r\nride, and giving him a thousand uncouth marks of respect and\r\ngood-will. At last, one night at the coffee-house, whither my lord came\r\nconsiderably flushed and excited with drink, he rushes up to Mr. Esmond,\r\nand cries out--\xe2\x80\x9cGive me joy, my dearest Colonel; I am the happiest of\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe happiest of men needs no dearest colonel to give him joy,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr.\r\nEsmond. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the cause of this supreme felicity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven't you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cDon't you know? I thought the family told\r\nyou everything: the adorable Beatrix hath promised to be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cries out Mr. Esmond, who had spent happy hours with Beatrix\r\nthat very morning--had writ verses for her, that she had sung at the\r\nharpsichord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cI waited on her to-day. I saw you walking towards\r\nKnightsbridge as I passed in my coach; and she looked so lovely,\r\nand spoke so kind, that I couldn't help going down on my knees,\r\nand--and--sure I am the happiest of men in all the world; and I'm very\r\nyoung; but she says I shall get older: and you know I shall be of age in\r\nfour months; and there's very little difference between us; and I'm so\r\nhappy. I should like to treat the company to something. Let us have a\r\nbottle--a dozen bottles--and drink the health of the finest woman in\r\nEngland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond left the young lord tossing off bumper after bumper, and strolled\r\naway to Kensington to ask whether the news was true. 'Twas only too\r\nsure: his mistress's sad, compassionate face told him the story; and\r\nthen she related what particulars of it she knew, and how my young lord\r\nhad made his offer, half an hour after Esmond went away that morning,\r\nand in the very room where the song lay yet on the harpsichord, which\r\nEsmond had writ, and they had sung together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE END OF MR. ESMOND'S ADVENTURES IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nI COME TO AN END OF MY BATTLES AND BRUISES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat feverish desire to gain a little reputation which Esmond had had,\r\nleft him now perhaps that he had attained some portion of his wish, and\r\nthe great motive of his ambition was over. His desire for military honor\r\nwas that it might raise him in Beatrix's eyes. 'Twas next to nobility\r\nand wealth, the only kind of rank she valued. It was the stake quickest\r\nwon or lost too; for law is a very long game that requires a life to\r\npractise; and to be distinguished in letters or the Church would not\r\nhave forwarded the poor gentleman's plans in the least. So he had no\r\nsuit to play but the red one, and he played it; and this, in truth, was\r\nthe reason of his speedy promotion; for he exposed himself more than\r\nmost gentlemen do, and risked more to win more. Is he the only man that\r\nhath set his life against a stake which may be not worth the winning?\r\nAnother risks his life (and his honor, too, sometimes,) against a bundle\r\nof bank-notes, or a yard of blue ribbon, or a seat in Parliament; and\r\nsome for the mere pleasure and excitement of the sport; as a field of a\r\nhundred huntsmen will do, each out-bawling and out-galloping the other\r\nat the tail of a dirty fox, that is to be the prize of the foremost\r\nhappy conqueror.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this news of Beatrix's engagement in marriage, Colonel\r\nEsmond knocked under to his fate, and resolved to surrender his sword,\r\nthat could win him nothing now he cared for; and in this dismal frame of\r\nmind he determined to retire from the regiment, to the great delight of\r\nthe captain next in rank to him, who happened to be a young gentleman\r\nof good fortune, who eagerly paid Mr. Esmond a thousand guineas for\r\nhis majority in Webb's regiment, and was knocked on the head the next\r\ncampaign. Perhaps Esmond would not have been sorry to share his fate. He\r\nwas more the Knight of the Woful Countenance than ever he had been. His\r\nmoodiness must have made him perfectly odious to his friends under the\r\ntents, who like a jolly fellow, and laugh at a melancholy warrior always\r\nsighing after Dulcinea at home.\r\n\r\nBoth the ladies of Castlewood approved of Mr. Esmond quitting the army,\r\nand his kind General coincided in his wish of retirement and helped\r\nin the transfer of his commission, which brought a pretty sum into his\r\npocket. But when the Commander-in-Chief came home, and was forced, in\r\nspite of himself, to appoint Lieutenant-General Webb to the command of a\r\ndivision of the army in Flanders, the Lieutenant-General prayed Colonel\r\nEsmond so urgently to be his aide-de-camp and military secretary, that\r\nEsmond could not resist his kind patron's entreaties, and again took the\r\nfield, not attached to any regiment, but under Webb's orders. What must\r\nhave been the continued agonies of fears* and apprehensions which racked\r\nthe gentle breasts of wives and matrons in those dreadful days, when\r\nevery Gazette brought accounts of deaths and battles, and when the\r\npresent anxiety over, and the beloved person escaped, the doubt still\r\nremained that a battle might be fought, possibly, of which the next\r\nFlanders letter would bring the account; so they, the poor tender\r\ncreatures, had to go on sickening and trembling through the whole\r\ncampaign. Whatever these terrors were on the part of Esmond's mistress,\r\n(and that tenderest of women must have felt them most keenly for both\r\nher sons, as she called them), she never allowed them outwardly to\r\nappear, but hid her apprehension, as she did her charities and devotion.\r\n'Twas only by chance that Esmond, wandering in Kensington, found his\r\nmistress coming out of a mean cottage there, and heard that she had\r\na score of poor retainers, whom she visited and comforted in their\r\nsickness and poverty, and who blessed her daily. She attended the\r\nearly church daily (though of a Sunday, especially, she encouraged and\r\nadvanced all sorts of cheerfulness and innocent gayety in her little\r\nhousehold): and by notes entered into a table-book of hers at this time,\r\nand devotional compositions writ with a sweet artless fervor, such as\r\nthe best divines could not surpass, showed how fond her heart was, how\r\nhumble and pious her spirit, what pangs of apprehension she endured\r\nsilently, and with what a faithful reliance she committed the care of\r\nthose she loved to the awful Dispenser of death and life.\r\n\r\n     * What indeed?  Psm. xci. 2, 3, 7.--R. E.\r\n\r\nAs for her ladyship at Chelsey, Esmond's newly adopted mother, she was\r\nnow of an age when the danger of any second party doth not disturb the\r\nrest much. She cared for trumps more than for most things in life. She\r\nwas firm enough in her own faith, but no longer very bitter against\r\nours. She had a very good-natured, easy French director, Monsieur\r\nGauthier by name, who was a gentleman of the world, and would take a\r\nhand of cards with Dean Atterbury, my lady's neighbor at Chelsey, and\r\nwas well with all the High Church party. No doubt Monsieur Gauthier knew\r\nwhat Esmond's peculiar position was, for he corresponded with Holt, and\r\nalways treated Colonel Esmond with particular respect and kindness; but\r\nfor good reasons the Colonel and the Abbe never spoke on this matter\r\ntogether, and so they remained perfect good friends.\r\n\r\nAll the frequenters of my Lady of Chelsey's house were of the Tory and\r\nHigh Church party. Madame Beatrix was as frantic about the King as her\r\nelderly kinswoman: she wore his picture on her heart; she had a piece\r\nof his hair; she vowed he was the most injured, and gallant, and\r\naccomplished, and unfortunate, and beautiful of princes. Steele, who\r\nquarrelled with very many of his Tory friends, but never with Esmond,\r\nused to tell the Colonel that his kinswoman's house was a rendezvous of\r\nTory intrigues; that Gauthier was a spy; that Atterbury was a spy;\r\nthat letters were constantly going from that house to the Queen at St.\r\nGermains; on which Esmond, laughing, would reply, that they used to\r\nsay in the army the Duke of Marlborough was a spy too, and as much in\r\ncorrespondence with that family as any Jesuit. And without entering very\r\neagerly into the controversy, Esmond had frankly taken the side of his\r\nfamily. It seemed to him that King James the Third was undoubtedly King\r\nof England by right: and at his sister's death it would be better to\r\nhave him than a foreigner over us. No man admired King William more; a\r\nhero and a conqueror, the bravest, justest, wisest of men--but 'twas by\r\nthe sword he conquered the country, and held and governed it by the very\r\nsame right that the great Cromwell held it, who was truly and greatly\r\na sovereign. But that a foreign despotic Prince, out of Germany,\r\nwho happened to be descended from King James the First, should\r\ntake possession of this empire, seemed to Mr. Esmond a monstrous\r\ninjustice--at least, every Englishman had a right to protest, and the\r\nEnglish Prince, the heir-at-law, the first of all. What man of spirit\r\nwith such a cause would not back it? What man of honor with such a crown\r\nto win would not fight for it? But that race was destined. That Prince\r\nhad himself against him, an enemy he could not overcome. He never dared\r\nto draw his sword, though he had it. He let his chances slip by as he\r\nlay in the lap of opera-girls, or snivelled at the knees of priests\r\nasking pardon; and the blood of heroes, and the devotedness of honest\r\nhearts, and endurance, courage, fidelity, were all spent for him in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to my Lady of Chelsey, who, when her son Esmond\r\nannounced to her ladyship that he proposed to make the ensuing campaign,\r\ntook leave of him with perfect alacrity, and was down to piquet with\r\nher gentlewoman before he had well quitted the room on his last visit.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTierce to a king,\xe2\x80\x9d were the last words he ever heard her say: the\r\ngame of life was pretty nearly over for the good lady, and three months\r\nafterwards she took to her bed, where she flickered out without any\r\npain, so the Abbe Gauthier wrote over to Mr. Esmond, then with his\r\nGeneral on the frontier of France. The Lady Castlewood was with her at\r\nher ending, and had written too, but these letters must have been taken\r\nby a privateer in the packet that brought them; for Esmond knew nothing\r\nof their contents until his return to England.\r\n\r\nMy Lady Castlewood had left everything to Colonel Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cas a\r\nreparation for the wrong done to him;\xe2\x80\x9d 'twas writ in her will. But\r\nher fortune was not much, for it never had been large, and the honest\r\nviscountess had wisely sunk most of the money she had upon an annuity\r\nwhich terminated with her life. However, there was the house and\r\nfurniture, plate and pictures at Chelsey, and a sum of money lying at\r\nher merchant's, Sir Josiah Child, which altogether would realize a\r\nsum of near three hundred pounds per annum, so that Mr. Esmond found\r\nhimself, if not rich, at least easy for life. Likewise there were the\r\nfamous diamonds which had been said to be worth fabulous sums, though\r\nthe goldsmith pronounced they would fetch no more than four thousand\r\npounds. These diamonds, however, Colonel Esmond reserved, having a\r\nspecial use for them: but the Chelsey house, plate, goods, &c., with the\r\nexception of a few articles which he kept back, were sold by his orders;\r\nand the sums resulting from the sale invested in the public securities\r\nso as to realize the aforesaid annual income of three hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nHaving now something to leave, he made a will and despatched it home.\r\nThe army was now in presence of the enemy; and a great battle expected\r\nevery day. 'Twas known that the General-in-Chief was in disgrace, and\r\nthe parties at home strong against him, and there was no stroke this\r\ngreat and resolute player would not venture to recall his fortune when\r\nit seemed desperate. Frank Castlewood was with Colonel Esmond; his\r\nGeneral having gladly taken the young nobleman on to his staff. His\r\nstudies of fortifications at Bruxelles were over by this time. The\r\nfort he was besieging had yielded, I believe, and my lord had not only\r\nmarched in with flying colors, but marched out again. He used to tell\r\nhis boyish wickednesses with admirable humor, and was the most charming\r\nyoung scapegrace in the army.\r\n\r\n'Tis needless to say that Colonel Esmond had left every penny of his\r\nlittle fortune to this boy. It was the Colonel's firm conviction that\r\nthe next battle would put an end to him: for he felt aweary of the sun,\r\nand quite ready to bid that and the earth farewell. Frank would not\r\nlisten to his comrade's gloomy forebodings, but swore they would keep\r\nhis birthday at Castlewood that autumn, after the campaign. He had\r\nheard of the engagement at home. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Prince Eugene goes to London,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nFrank, \xe2\x80\x9cand Trix can get hold of him, she'll jilt Ashburnham for his\r\nHighness. I tell you, she used to make eyes at the Duke of Marlborough,\r\nwhen she was only fourteen, and ogling poor little Blandford. I wouldn't\r\nmarry her, Harry--no, not if her eyes were twice as big. I'll take my\r\nfun. I'll enjoy for the next three years every possible pleasure. I'll\r\nsow my wild oats then, and marry some quiet, steady, modest, sensible\r\nviscountess; hunt my harriers; and settle down at Castlewood. Perhaps\r\nI'll represent the county--no, damme, YOU shall represent the county.\r\nYou have the brains of the family. By the Lord, my dear old Harry, you\r\nhave the best head and the kindest heart in all the army; and every man\r\nsays so--and when the Queen dies, and the King comes back, why shouldn't\r\nyou go to the House of Commons, and be a Minister, and be made a Peer,\r\nand that sort of thing? YOU be shot in the next action! I wager a dozen\r\nof Burgundy you are not touched. Mohun is well of his wound. He is\r\nalways with Corporal John now. As soon as ever I see his ugly face I'll\r\nspit in it. I took lessons of Father--of Captain Holt at Bruxelles. What\r\na man that is! He knows everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond bade Frank have a care; that\r\nFather Holt's knowledge was rather dangerous; not, indeed, knowing as\r\nyet how far the Father had pushed his instructions with his young pupil.\r\n\r\nThe gazetteers and writers, both of the French and English side,\r\nhave given accounts sufficient of that bloody battle of Blarignies or\r\nMalplaquet, which was the last and the hardest earned of the victories\r\nof the great Duke of Marlborough. In that tremendous combat near upon\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand men were engaged, more than thirty\r\nthousand of whom were slain or wounded (the Allies lost twice as\r\nmany men as they killed of the French, whom they conquered): and this\r\ndreadful slaughter very likely took place because a great general's\r\ncredit was shaken at home, and he thought to restore it by a victory. If\r\nsuch were the motives which induced the Duke of Marlborough to venture\r\nthat prodigious stake, and desperately sacrifice thirty thousand brave\r\nlives, so that he might figure once more in a Gazette, and hold his\r\nplaces and pensions a little longer, the event defeated the dreadful and\r\nselfish design, for the victory was purchased at a cost which no nation,\r\ngreedy of glory as it may be, would willingly pay for any triumph. The\r\ngallantry of the French was as remarkable as the furious bravery of\r\ntheir assailants. We took a few score of their flags, and a few pieces\r\nof their artillery; but we left twenty thousand of the bravest soldiers\r\nof the world round about the intrenched lines, from which the enemy was\r\ndriven. He retreated in perfect good order; the panic-spell seemed to\r\nbe broke, under which the French had labored ever since the disaster\r\nof Hochstedt; and, fighting now on the threshold of their country, they\r\nshowed an heroic ardor of resistance, such as had never met us in the\r\ncourse of their aggressive war. Had the battle been more successful,\r\nthe conqueror might have got the price for which he waged it. As it was,\r\n(and justly, I think,) the party adverse to the Duke in England were\r\nindignant at the lavish extravagance of slaughter, and demanded more\r\neagerly than ever the recall of a chief whose cupidity and desperation\r\nmight urge him further still. After this bloody fight of Malplaquet, I\r\ncan answer for it, that in the Dutch quarters and our own, and amongst\r\nthe very regiments and commanders whose gallantry was most conspicuous\r\nupon this frightful day of carnage, the general cry was, that there was\r\nenough of the war. The French were driven back into their own boundary,\r\nand all their conquests and booty of Flanders disgorged. As for the\r\nPrince of Savoy, with whom our Commander-in-Chief, for reasons of his\r\nown, consorted more closely than ever, 'twas known that he was animated\r\nnot merely by a political hatred, but by personal rage against the old\r\nFrench King: the Imperial Generalissimo never forgot the slight put by\r\nLewis upon the Abbe de Savoie; and in the humiliation or ruin of his\r\nmost Christian Majesty, the Holy Roman Emperor found his account.\r\nBut what were these quarrels to us, the free citizens of England and\r\nHolland! Despot as he was, the French monarch was yet the chief of\r\nEuropean civilization, more venerable in his age and misfortunes than at\r\nthe period of his most splendid successes; whilst his opponent was but\r\na semi-barbarous tyrant, with a pillaging, murderous horde of Croats\r\nand Pandours, composing a half of his army, filling our camp with their\r\nstrange figures, bearded like the miscreant Turks their neighbors, and\r\ncarrying into Christian warfare their native heathen habits of rapine,\r\nlust, and murder. Why should the best blood in England and France be\r\nshed in order that the Holy Roman and Apostolic master of these ruffians\r\nshould have his revenge over the Christian king? And it was to this end\r\nwe were fighting; for this that every village and family in England was\r\ndeploring the death of beloved sons and fathers. We dared not speak to\r\neach other, even at table, of Malplaquet, so frightful were the gaps\r\nleft in our army by the cannon of that bloody action. 'Twas heartrending\r\nfor an officer who had a heart to look down his line on a parade-day\r\nafterwards, and miss hundreds of faces of comrades--humble or of high\r\nrank--that had gathered but yesterday full of courage and cheerfulness\r\nround the torn and blackened flags. Where were our friends? As the great\r\nDuke reviewed us, riding along our lines with his fine suite of prancing\r\naides-de-camp and generals, stopping here and there to thank an officer\r\nwith those eager smiles and bows of which his Grace was always lavish,\r\nscarce a huzzah could be got for him, though Cadogan, with an oath, rode\r\nup and cried--\xe2\x80\x9cD--n you, why don't you cheer?\xe2\x80\x9d But the men had no\r\nheart for that: not one of them but was thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere's my\r\ncomrade?--where's my brother that fought by me, or my dear captain that\r\nled me yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d 'Twas the most gloomy pageant I ever looked on; and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cTe Deum\xe2\x80\x9d sung by our chaplains, the most woful and dreary satire.\r\n\r\nEsmond's General added one more to the many marks of honor which he\r\nhad received in the front of a score of battles, and got a wound in\r\nthe groin, which laid him on his back; and you may be sure he\r\nconsoled himself by abusing the Commander-in-Chief, as he lay\r\ngroaning,--\xe2\x80\x9cCorporal John's as fond of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say, \xe2\x80\x9cas King\r\nDavid was of General Uriah; and so he always gives me the post of\r\ndanger.\xe2\x80\x9d He persisted, to his dying day, in believing that the Duke\r\nintended he should be beat at Wynendael, and sent him purposely with a\r\nsmall force, hoping that he might be knocked on the head there. Esmond\r\nand Frank Castlewood both escaped without hurt, though the division\r\nwhich our General commanded suffered even more than any other, having to\r\nsustain not only the fury of the enemy's cannonade, which was very hot\r\nand well served, but the furious and repeated charges of the famous\r\nMaison du Roy, which we had to receive and beat off again and again,\r\nwith volleys of shot and hedges of iron, and our four lines of\r\nmusqueteers and pikemen. They said the King of England charged us\r\nno less than twelve times that day, along with the French Household.\r\nEsmond's late regiment, General Webb's own Fusileers, served in the\r\ndivision which their colonel commanded. The General was thrice in the\r\ncentre of the square of the Fusileers, calling the fire at the French\r\ncharges, and, after the action, his Grace the Duke of Berwick sent his\r\ncompliments to his old regiment and their Colonel for their behavior on\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nWe drank my Lord Castlewood's health and majority, the 25th of\r\nSeptember, the army being then before Mons: and here Colonel Esmond was\r\nnot so fortunate as he had been in actions much more dangerous, and was\r\nhit by a spent ball just above the place where his former wound was,\r\nwhich caused the old wound to open again, fever, spitting of blood,\r\nand other ugly symptoms, to ensue; and, in a word, brought him near to\r\ndeath's door. The kind lad, his kinsman, attended his elder comrade with\r\na very praiseworthy affectionateness and care until he was pronounced\r\nout of danger by the doctors, when Frank went off, passed the winter at\r\nBruxelles, and besieged, no doubt, some other fortress there. Very few\r\nlads would have given up their pleasures so long and so gayly as Frank\r\ndid; his cheerful prattle soothed many long days of Esmond's pain and\r\nlanguor. Frank was supposed to be still at his kinsman's bedside for\r\na month after he had left it, for letters came from his mother at\r\nhome full of thanks to the younger gentleman for his care of his elder\r\nbrother (so it pleased Esmond's mistress now affectionately to style\r\nhim); nor was Mr. Esmond in a hurry to undeceive her, when the good\r\nyoung fellow was gone for his Christmas holiday. It was as pleasant to\r\nEsmond on his couch to watch the young man's pleasure at the idea of\r\nbeing free, as to note his simple efforts to disguise his satisfaction\r\non going away. There are days when a flask of champagne at a cabaret,\r\nand a red-cheeked partner to share it, are too strong temptations for\r\nany young fellow of spirit. I am not going to play the moralist, and\r\ncry \xe2\x80\x9cFie.\xe2\x80\x9d For ages past, I know how old men preach, and what young\r\nmen practise; and that patriarchs have had their weak moments too, long\r\nsince Father Noah toppled over after discovering the vine. Frank went\r\noff, then, to his pleasures at Bruxelles, in which capital many young\r\nfellows of our army declared they found infinitely greater diversion\r\neven than in London: and Mr. Henry Esmond remained in his sick-room,\r\nwhere he writ a fine comedy, that his mistress pronounced to be sublime,\r\nand that was acted no less than three successive nights in London in the\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\nHere, as he lay nursing himself, ubiquitous Mr. Holt reappeared, and\r\nstopped a whole month at Mons, where he not only won over Colonel Esmond\r\nto the King's side in politics (that side being always held by the\r\nEsmond family); but where he endeavored to reopen the controversial\r\nquestion between the churches once more, and to recall Esmond to that\r\nreligion in which, in his infancy, he had been baptized. Holt was a\r\ncasuist, both dexterous and learned, and presented the case between\r\nthe English church and his own in such a way that those who granted\r\nhis premises ought certainly to allow his conclusions. He touched on\r\nEsmond's delicate state of health, chance of dissolution, and so forth;\r\nand enlarged upon the immense benefits that the sick man was likely to\r\nforego--benefits which the church of England did not deny to those of\r\nthe Roman communion, as how should she, being derived from that church,\r\nand only an offshoot from it? But Mr. Esmond said that his church was\r\nthe church of his country, and to that he chose to remain faithful:\r\nother people were welcome to worship and to subscribe any other set of\r\narticles, whether at Rome or at Augsburg. But if the good Father meant\r\nthat Esmond should join the Roman communion for fear of consequences,\r\nand that all England ran the risk of being damned for heresy, Esmond,\r\nfor one, was perfectly willing to take his chance of the penalty along\r\nwith the countless millions of his fellow-countrymen, who were bred\r\nin the same faith, and along with some of the noblest, the truest, the\r\npurest, the wisest, the most pious and learned men and women in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs for the political question, in that Mr. Esmond could agree with the\r\nFather much more readily, and had come to the same conclusion,\r\nthough, perhaps, by a different way. The right divine, about which Dr.\r\nSacheverel and the High Church party in England were just now making a\r\nbother, they were welcome to hold as they chose. If Richard Cromwell,\r\nand his father before him had been crowned and anointed (and bishops\r\nenough would have been found to do it), it seemed to Mr. Esmond that\r\nthey would have had the right divine just as much as any Plantagenet, or\r\nTudor, or Stuart. But the desire of the country being unquestionably\r\nfor an hereditary monarchy, Esmond thought an English king out of St.\r\nGermains was better and fitter than a German prince from Herrenhausen,\r\nand that if he failed to satisfy the nation, some other Englishman might\r\nbe found to take his place; and so, though with no frantic enthusiasm,\r\nor worship of that monstrous pedigree which the Tories chose to consider\r\ndivine, he was ready to say, \xe2\x80\x9cGod save King James!\xe2\x80\x9d when Queen Anne went\r\nthe way of kings and commoners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear, Colonel, you are no better than a republican at heart,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nthe priest with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an Englishman,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cand take my country as I find her.\r\nThe will of the nation being for church and king, I am for church and\r\nking too; but English church and English king; and that is why your\r\nchurch isn't mine, though your king is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough they lost the day at Malplaquet, it was the French who were\r\nelated by that action, whilst the conquerors were dispirited, by it; and\r\nthe enemy gathered together a larger army than ever, and made prodigious\r\nefforts for the next campaign. Marshal Berwick was with the French this\r\nyear; and we heard that Mareschal Villars was still suffering of his\r\nwound, was eager to bring our Duke to action, and vowed he would fight\r\nus in his coach. Young Castlewood came flying back from Bruxelles, as\r\nsoon as he heard that fighting was to begin; and the arrival of the\r\nChevalier de St. George was announced about May. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's the King's third\r\ncampaign, and it's mine,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank liked saying. He was come back a greater\r\nJacobite than ever, and Esmond suspected that some fair conspirators\r\nat Bruxelles had been inflaming the young man's ardor. Indeed, he owned\r\nthat he had a message from the Queen, Beatrix's godmother, who had given\r\nher name to Frank's sister the year before he and his sovereign were\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nHowever desirous Marshal Villars might be to fight, my Lord Duke did not\r\nseem disposed to indulge him this campaign. Last year his Grace had been\r\nall for the Whigs and Hanoverians; but finding, on going to England, his\r\ncountry cold towards himself, and the people in a ferment of High Church\r\nloyalty, the Duke comes back to his army cooled towards the Hanoverians,\r\ncautious with the Imperialists, and particularly civil and polite\r\ntowards the Chevalier de St. George. 'Tis certain that messengers and\r\nletters were continually passing between his Grace and his brave nephew,\r\nthe Duke of Berwick, in the opposite camp. No man's caresses were more\r\nopportune than his Grace's, and no man ever uttered expressions of\r\nregard and affection more generously. He professed to Monsieur de Torcy,\r\nso Mr. St. John told the writer, quite an eagerness to be cut in pieces\r\nfor the exiled Queen and her family; nay more, I believe, this year\r\nhe parted with a portion of the most precious part of himself--his\r\nmoney--which he sent over to the royal exiles. Mr. Tunstal, who was in\r\nthe Prince's service, was twice or thrice in and out of our camp; the\r\nFrench, in theirs of Arlieu and about Arras. A little river, the Canihe\r\nI think 'twas called, (but this is writ away from books and Europe; and\r\nthe only map the writer hath of these scenes of his youth, bears no\r\nmark of this little stream,) divided our pickets from the enemy's.\r\nOur sentries talked across the stream, when they could make themselves\r\nunderstood to each other, and when they could not, grinned, and handed\r\neach other their brandy-flasks or their pouches of tobacco. And one fine\r\nday of June, riding thither with the officer who visited the outposts,\r\n(Colonel Esmond was taking an airing on horseback, being too weak for\r\nmilitary duty,) they came to this river, where a number of English and\r\nScots were assembled, talking to the good-natured enemy on the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\nEsmond was especially amused with the talk of one long fellow, with a\r\ngreat curling red moustache, and blue eyes, that was half a dozen\r\ninches taller than his swarthy little comrades on the French side of the\r\nstream, and being asked by the Colonel, saluted him, and said that he\r\nbelonged to the Royal Cravats.\r\n\r\nFrom his way of saying \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal Cravat,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond at once knew that the\r\nfellow's tongue had first wagged on the banks of the Liffey, and not\r\nthe Loire; and the poor soldier--a deserter probably--did not like to\r\nventure very deep into French conversation, lest his unlucky brogue\r\nshould peep out. He chose to restrict himself to such few expressions\r\nin the French language as he thought he had mastered easily; and\r\nhis attempt at disguise was infinitely amusing. Mr. Esmond whistled\r\nLillibullero, at which Teague's eyes began to twinkle, and then flung\r\nhim a dollar, when the poor boy broke out with a \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless--that is,\r\nDieu benisse votre honor,\xe2\x80\x9d that would infallibly have sent him to the\r\nprovost-marshal had he been on our side of the river.\r\n\r\nWhilst this parley was going on, three officers on horseback, on the\r\nFrench side, appeared at some little distance, and stopped as if eying\r\nus, when one of them left the other two, and rode close up to us who\r\nwere by the stream. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, look!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Royal Cravat, with great\r\nagitation, \xe2\x80\x9cpas lui, that's he; not him, l'autre,\xe2\x80\x9d and pointed to the\r\ndistant officer on a chestnut horse, with a cuirass shining in the sun,\r\nand over it a broad blue ribbon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to take Mr. Hamilton's services to my Lord Marlborough--my Lord\r\nDuke,\xe2\x80\x9d says the gentleman in English: and, looking to see that the party\r\nwere not hostilely disposed, he added, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cThere's a friend\r\nof yours, gentlemen, yonder; he bids me to say that he saw some of your\r\nfaces on the 11th of September last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the gentleman spoke, the other two officers rode up, and came quite\r\nclose. We knew at once who it was. It was the King, then two-and-twenty\r\nyears old, tall and slim, with deep brown eyes, that looked melancholy,\r\nthough his lips wore a smile. We took off our hats and saluted him. No\r\nman, sure, could see for the first time, without emotion, the youthful\r\ninheritor of so much fame and misfortune. It seemed to Mr. Esmond that\r\nthe Prince was not unlike young Castlewood, whose age and figure he\r\nresembled. The Chevalier de St. George acknowledged the salute, and\r\nlooked at us hard. Even the idlers on our side of the river set up a\r\nhurrah. As for the Royal Cravat, he ran to the Prince's stirrup, knelt\r\ndown and kissed his boot, and bawled and looked a hundred ejaculations\r\nand blessings. The prince bade the aide-de-camp give him a piece of\r\nmoney; and when the party saluting us had ridden away, Cravat spat upon\r\nthe piece of gold by way of benediction, and swaggered away, pouching\r\nhis coin and twirling his honest carroty moustache.\r\n\r\nThe officer in whose company Esmond was, the same little captain of\r\nHandyside's regiment, Mr. Sterne, who had proposed the garden at Lille,\r\nwhen my Lord Mohun and Esmond had their affair, was an Irishman too, and\r\nas brave a little soul as ever wore a sword. \xe2\x80\x9cBedad,\xe2\x80\x9d says Roger Sterne,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat long fellow spoke French so beautiful that I shouldn't have known\r\nhe wasn't a foreigner, till he broke out with his hulla-ballooing, and\r\nonly an Irish calf can bellow like that.\xe2\x80\x9d And Roger made another remark\r\nin his wild way, in which there was sense as well as absurdity--\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\r\nyoung gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cwould but ride over to our camp, instead of\r\nVillars's, toss up his hat and say, 'Here am I, the King, who'll follow\r\nme?' by the Lord, Esmond, the whole army would rise and carry him home\r\nagain, and beat Villars, and take Paris by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe news of the Prince's visit was all through the camp quickly, and\r\nscores of ours went down in hopes to see him. Major Hamilton, whom\r\nwe had talked with, sent back by a trumpet several silver pieces for\r\nofficers with us. Mr. Esmond received one of these; and that medal, and\r\na recompense not uncommon amongst Princes, were the only rewards he\r\never had from a Royal person, whom he endeavored not very long after to\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nEsmond quitted the army almost immediately after this, following his\r\ngeneral home; and, indeed, being advised to travel in the fine weather\r\nand attempt to take no further part in the campaign. But he heard from\r\nthe army, that of the many who crowded to see the Chevalier de St.\r\nGeorge, Frank Castlewood had made himself most conspicuous: my Lord\r\nViscount riding across the little stream bareheaded to where the Prince\r\nwas, and dismounting and kneeling before him to do him homage. Some\r\nsaid that the Prince had actually knighted him, but my lord denied\r\nthat statement, though he acknowledged the rest of the story, and\r\nsaid:--\xe2\x80\x9cFrom having been out of favor with Corporal John,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called\r\nthe Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore his Grace warned him not to commit those follies, and\r\nsmiled on him cordially ever after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was so kind to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank writ, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I thought I would put in a\r\ngood word for Master Harry, but when I mentioned your name he looked as\r\nblack as thunder, and said he had never heard of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nI GO HOME, AND HARP ON THE OLD STRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter quitting Mons and the army, and as he was waiting for a packet\r\nat Ostend, Esmond had a letter from his young kinsman Castlewood at\r\nBruxelles, conveying intelligence whereof Frank besought him to be the\r\nbearer to London, and which caused Colonel Esmond no small anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe young scapegrace, being one-and-twenty years old, and being anxious\r\nto sow his \xe2\x80\x9cwild otes,\xe2\x80\x9d as he wrote, had married Mademoiselle de\r\nWertheim, daughter of Count de Wertheim, Chamberlain to the Emperor,\r\nand having a post in the Household of the Governor of the Netherlands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.,\xe2\x80\x9d the young gentleman wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cClotilda is OLDER THAN ME, which\r\nperhaps may be objected to her: but I am so OLD A RAIK that the age\r\nmakes no difference, and I am DETERMINED to reform. We were married at\r\nSt. Gudule, by Father Holt. She is heart and soul for the GOOD CAUSE.\r\nAnd here the cry is Vif-le-Roy, which my mother will JOIN IN, and Trix\r\nTOO. Break this news to 'em gently: and tell Mr. Finch, my agent, to\r\npress the people for their rents, and send me the RYNO anyhow. Clotilda\r\nsings, and plays on the Spinet BEAUTIFULLY. She is a fair beauty. And\r\nif it's a son, you shall stand GODFATHER. I'm going to leave the army,\r\nhaving had ENUF OF SOLDERING; and my Lord Duke RECOMMENDS me. I shall\r\npass the winter here: and stop at least until Clo's lying in. I call\r\nher OLD CLO, but nobody else shall. She is the cleverest woman in all\r\nBruxelles: understanding painting, music, poetry, and perfect at COOKERY\r\nAND PUDDENS. I borded with the Count, that's how I came to know her.\r\nThere are four Counts her brothers. One an Abbey--three with the\r\nPrince's army. They have a lawsuit for AN IMMENCE FORTUNE: but are now\r\nin a PORE WAY. Break this to mother, who'll take anything from YOU.\r\nAnd write, and bid Finch write AMEDIATELY. Hostel de l'Aigle Noire,\r\nBruxelles, Flanders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Frank had married a Roman Catholic lady, and an heir was expected,\r\nand Mr. Esmond was to carry this intelligence to his mistress at London.\r\n'Twas a difficult embassy; and the Colonel felt not a little tremor as\r\nhe neared the capital.\r\n\r\nHe reached his inn late, and sent a messenger to Kensington to announce\r\nhis arrival and visit the next morning. The messenger brought back news\r\nthat the Court was at Windsor, and the fair Beatrix absent and engaged\r\nin her duties there. Only Esmond's mistress remained in her house at\r\nKensington. She appeared in court but once in the year; Beatrix was\r\nquite the mistress and ruler of the little mansion, inviting the company\r\nthither, and engaging in every conceivable frolic of town pleasure.\r\nWhilst her mother, acting as the young lady's protectress and elder\r\nsister, pursued her own path, which was quite modest and secluded.\r\n\r\nAs soon as ever Esmond was dressed (and he had been awake long before\r\nthe town), he took a coach for Kensington, and reached it so early that\r\nhe met his dear mistress coming home from morning prayers. She carried\r\nher prayer-book, never allowing a footman to bear it, as everybody else\r\ndid: and it was by this simple sign Esmond knew what her occupation had\r\nbeen. He called to the coachman to stop, and jumped out as she looked\r\ntowards him. She wore her hood as usual, and she turned quite pale when\r\nshe saw him. To feel that kind little hand near to his heart seemed\r\nto give him strength. They were soon at the door of her ladyship's\r\nhouse--and within it.\r\n\r\nWith a sweet sad smile she took his hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow ill you have been: how weak you look, my dear Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n'Tis certain the Colonel did look like a ghost, except that ghosts do\r\nnot look very happy, 'tis said. Esmond always felt so on returning to\r\nher after absence, indeed whenever he looked in her sweet kind face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am come back to be nursed by my family,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Frank had\r\nnot taken care of me after my wound, very likely I should have gone\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Frank, good Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d says his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cYou'll always be kind to\r\nhim, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor child never knew he was doing you\r\na wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cries out Colonel Esmond. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, dear lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no lady,\xe2\x80\x9d says she; \xe2\x80\x9cI am Rachel Esmond, Francis Esmond's widow,\r\nmy lord. I cannot bear that title. Would we never had taken it from him\r\nwho has it now. But we did all in our power, Henry: we did all in our\r\npower; and my lord and I--that is--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you this tale, dearest lady?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not had the letter I writ you? I writ to you at Mons directly\r\nI heard it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lady Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd from whom?\xe2\x80\x9d again asked Colonel Esmond--and his mistress then told\r\nhim that on her death-bed the Dowager Countess, sending for her, had\r\npresented her with this dismal secret as a legacy. \xe2\x80\x9c'Twas very malicious\r\nof the Dowager,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Esmond said, \xe2\x80\x9cto have had it so long, and to\r\nhave kept the truth from me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCousin Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,--and Esmond's\r\nmistress could not forbear smiling as she told the story--\xe2\x80\x9cCousin\r\nRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Dowager, \xe2\x80\x9cI have sent for you, as the doctors say\r\nI may go off any day in this dysentery; and to ease my conscience of a\r\ngreat load that has been on it. You always have been a poor creature and\r\nunfit for great honor, and what I have to say won't, therefore, affect\r\nyou so much. You must know, Cousin Rachel, that I have left my house,\r\nplate, and furniture, three thousand pounds in money, and my diamonds\r\nthat my late revered Saint and Sovereign, King James, presented me with,\r\nto my Lord Viscount Castlewood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d says Lady Castlewood; \xe2\x80\x9cI was in hopes--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Viscount Castlewood, my dear; Viscount Castlewood and Baron Esmond\r\nof Shandon in the Kingdom of Ireland, Earl and Marquis of Esmond under\r\npatent of his Majesty King James the Second, conferred upon my husband\r\nthe late Marquis--for I am Marchioness of Esmond before God and man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you left poor Harry nothing, dear Marchioness?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Lady\r\nCastlewood (she hath told me the story completely since with her quiet\r\narch way; the most charming any woman ever had: and I set down the\r\nnarrative here at length, so as to have done with it). \xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you\r\nleft poor Harry nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d asks my dear lady: \xe2\x80\x9cfor you know, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsays with her sweet smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI used always to pity Esau--and I think I am\r\non his side--though papa tried very hard to convince me the other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Harry!\xe2\x80\x9d says the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you want something left to poor\r\nHarry: he,--he! (reach me the drops, cousin). Well, then, my dear, since\r\nyou want poor Harry to have a fortune, you must understand that ever\r\nsince the year 1691, a week after the battle of the Boyne, where the\r\nPrince of Orange defeated his royal sovereign and father, for which\r\ncrime he is now suffering in flames (ugh! ugh!) Henry Esmond hath been\r\nMarquis of Esmond and Earl of Castlewood in the United Kingdom, and\r\nBaron and Viscount Castlewood of Shandon in Ireland, and a Baronet--and\r\nhis eldest son will be, by courtesy, styled Earl of Castlewood--he! he!\r\nWhat do you think of that, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious mercy! how long have you known this?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the other lady\r\n(thinking perhaps that the old Marchioness was wandering in her wits).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband, before he was converted, was a wicked wretch,\xe2\x80\x9d the sick\r\nsinner continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he was in the Low Countries he seduced a\r\nweaver's daughter; and added to his wickedness by marrying her. And then\r\nhe came to this country and married me--a poor girl--a poor innocent\r\nyoung thing--I say,\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cthough she was past forty, you know, Harry, when\r\nshe married: and as for being innocent\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew\r\nnothing of my lord's wickedness for three years after our marriage, and\r\nafter the burial of our poor little boy I had it done over again, my\r\ndear: I had myself married by Father Holt in Castlewood chapel, as soon\r\nas ever I heard the creature was dead--and having a great illness then,\r\narising from another sad disappointment I had, the priest came and told\r\nme that my lord had a son before our marriage, and that the child was at\r\nnurse in England; and I consented to let the brat be brought home, and a\r\nqueer little melancholy child it was when it came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur intention was to make a priest of him: and he was bred for this,\r\nuntil you perverted him from it, you wicked woman. And I had again hopes\r\nof giving an heir to my lord, when he was called away upon the King's\r\nbusiness, and died fighting gloriously at the Boyne water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould I be disappointed--I owed your husband no love, my dear, for he\r\nhad jilted me in the most scandalous way and I thought there would be\r\ntime to declare the little weaver's son for the true heir. But I was\r\ncarried off to prison, where your husband was so kind to me--urging\r\nall his friends to obtain my release, and using all his credit in my\r\nfavor--that I relented towards him, especially as my director counselled\r\nme to be silent; and that it was for the good of the King's service\r\nthat the title of our family should continue with your husband the late\r\nviscount, whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the King. And\r\na proof of this is, that a year before your husband's death, when he\r\nthought of taking a place under the Prince of Orange, Mr. Holt went to\r\nhim, and told him what the state of the matter was, and obliged him to\r\nraise a large sum for his Majesty; and engaged him in the true cause so\r\nheartily, that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be\r\nconsidered advisable to attack the usurper. Then his sudden death came;\r\nand there was a thought of declaring the truth. But 'twas determined\r\nto be best for the King's service to let the title still go with the\r\nyounger branch; and there's no sacrifice a Castlewood wouldn't make for\r\nthat cause, my dear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for Colonel Esmond, he knew the truth already.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n my mistress said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe told me of what had happened at my dear husband's\r\ndeath-bed\xe2\x80\x9d). \xe2\x80\x9cHe doth not intend to take the title, though it belongs to\r\nhim. But it eases my conscience that you should know the truth, my dear.\r\nAnd your son is lawfully Viscount Castlewood so long as his cousin doth\r\nnot claim the rank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the substance of the Dowager's revelation. Dean Atterbury had\r\nknowledge of it, Lady Castlewood said, and Esmond very well knows how:\r\nthat divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his\r\ndeath-bed: and when Lady Castlewood would instantly have written to her\r\nson, and conveyed the truth to him, the Dean's advice was that a letter\r\nshould be writ to Colonel Esmond rather; that the matter should be\r\nsubmitted to his decision, by which alone the rest of the family were\r\nbound to abide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can my dearest lady doubt what that will be?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt rests with you, Harry, as the head of our house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was settled twelve years since, by my dear lord's bedside,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nColonel Esmond. \xe2\x80\x9cThe children must know nothing of this. Frank and his\r\nheirs after him must bear our name. 'Tis his rightfully; I have not even\r\na proof of that marriage of my father and mother, though my poor lord,\r\non his death-bed, told me that Father Holt had brought such a proof to\r\nCastlewood. I would not seek it when I was abroad. I went and looked at\r\nmy poor mother's grave in her convent. What matter to her now? No court\r\nof law on earth, upon my mere word, would deprive my Lord Viscount and\r\nset me up. I am the head of the house, dear lady; but Frank is Viscount\r\nof Castlewood still. And rather than disturb him, I would turn monk, or\r\ndisappear in America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke so to his dearest mistress, for whom he would have been\r\nwilling to give up his life, or to make any sacrifice any day, the fond\r\ncreature flung herself down on her knees before him, and kissed both his\r\nhands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude, such as could not\r\nbut melt his heart, and make him feel very proud and thankful that God\r\nhad given him the power to show his love for her, and to prove it by\r\nsome little sacrifice on his own part. To be able to bestow benefits\r\nor happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred\r\nupon a man--and what wealth or name, or gratification of ambition or\r\nvanity, could compare with the pleasure Esmond now had of being able to\r\nconfer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest saint,\xe2\x80\x9d says he--\xe2\x80\x9cpurest soul, that has had so much to suffer,\r\nthat has blest the poor lonely orphan with such a treasure of love. 'Tis\r\nfor me to kneel, not for you: 'tis for me to be thankful that I can make\r\nyou happy. Hath my life any other aim? Blessed be God that I can serve\r\nyou! What pleasure, think you, could all the world give me compared to\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't raise me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a wild way, to Esmond, who would have\r\nlifted her. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me kneel--let me kneel, and--and--worship you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore such a partial judge as Esmond's dear mistress owned herself to\r\nbe, any cause which he might plead was sure to be given in his favor;\r\nand accordingly he found little difficulty in reconciling her to the\r\nnews whereof he was bearer, of her son's marriage to a foreign lady,\r\nPapist though she was. Lady Castlewood never could be brought to think\r\nso ill of that religion as other people in England thought of it: she\r\nheld that ours was undoubtedly a branch of the Catholic church, but that\r\nthe Roman was one of the main stems on which, no doubt, many errors had\r\nbeen grafted (she was, for a woman, extraordinarily well versed in this\r\ncontroversy, having acted, as a girl, as secretary to her father, the\r\nlate dean, and written many of his sermons, under his dictation); and if\r\nFrank had chosen to marry a lady of the church of south Europe, as she\r\nwould call the Roman communion, there was no need why she should not\r\nwelcome her as a daughter-in-law: and accordingly she wrote to her new\r\ndaughter a very pretty, touching letter (as Esmond thought, who had\r\ncognizance of it before it went), in which the only hint of reproof was\r\na gentle remonstrance that her son had not written to herself, to ask\r\na fond mother's blessing for that step which he was about taking.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCastlewood knew very well,\xe2\x80\x9d so she wrote to her son, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she never\r\ndenied him anything in her power to give, much less would she think of\r\nopposing a marriage that was to make his happiness, as she trusted, and\r\nkeep him out of wild courses, which had alarmed her a good deal:\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe besought him to come quickly to England, to settle down in his\r\nfamily house of Castlewood (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is his family house,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, to\r\nColonel Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cthough only his own house by your forbearance\xe2\x80\x9d) and to\r\nreceive the accompt of her stewardship during his ten years' minority.\r\nBy care and frugality, she had got the estate into a better condition\r\nthan ever it had been since the Parliamentary wars; and my lord was now\r\nmaster of a pretty, small income, not encumbered of debts, as it\r\nhad been, during his father's ruinous time. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in saving my son's\r\nfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear I have lost a great part of my hold on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And, indeed, this was the case: her ladyship's daughter complaining that\r\ntheir mother did all for Frank, and nothing for her; and Frank himself\r\nbeing dissatisfied at the narrow, simple way of his mother's living at\r\nWalcote, where he had been brought up more like a poor parson's son\r\nthan a young nobleman that was to make a figure in the world. 'Twas this\r\nmistake in his early training, very likely, that set him so eager upon\r\npleasure when he had it in his power; nor is he the first lad that has\r\nbeen spoiled by the over-careful fondness of women. No training is so\r\nuseful for children, great or small, as the company of their betters in\r\nrank or natural parts; in whose society they lose the overweening sense\r\nof their own importance, which stay-at-home people very commonly learn.\r\n\r\nBut, as a prodigal that's sending in a schedule of his debts to his\r\nfriends, never puts all down, and, you may be sure, the rogue keeps back\r\nsome immense swingeing bill, that he doesn't dare to own; so the poor\r\nFrank had a very heavy piece of news to break to his mother, and which\r\nhe hadn't the courage to introduce into his first confession. Some\r\nmisgivings Esmond might have, upon receiving Frank's letter, and knowing\r\ninto what hands the boy had fallen; but whatever these misgivings were,\r\nhe kept them to himself, not caring to trouble his mistress with any\r\nfears that might be groundless.\r\n\r\nHowever, the next mail which came from Bruxelles, after Frank had\r\nreceived his mother's letters there, brought back a joint composition\r\nfrom himself and his wife, who could spell no better than her young\r\nscapegrace of a husband, full of expressions of thanks, love, and duty\r\nto the Dowager Viscountess, as my poor lady now was styled; and along\r\nwith this letter (which was read in a family council, namely, the\r\nViscountess, Mistress Beatrix, and the writer of this memoir, and which\r\nwas pronounced to be vulgar by the maid of honor, and felt to be so by\r\nthe other two), there came a private letter for Colonel Esmond from poor\r\nFrank, with another dismal commission for the Colonel to execute, at his\r\nbest opportunity; and this was to announce that Frank had seen fit,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cby the exhortation of Mr. Holt, the influence of his Clotilda, and the\r\nblessing of heaven and the saints,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, demurely, \xe2\x80\x9cto change\r\nhis religion, and be received into the bosom of that church of which\r\nhis sovereign, many of his family, and the greater part of the civilized\r\nworld, were members.\xe2\x80\x9d And his lordship added a postscript, of which\r\nEsmond knew the inspiring genius very well, for it had the genuine twang\r\nof the Seminary, and was quite unlike poor Frank's ordinary style of\r\nwriting and thinking; in which he reminded Colonel Esmond that he too\r\nwas, by birth, of that church; and that his mother and sister should\r\nhave his lordship's prayers to the saints (an inestimable benefit,\r\ntruly!) for their conversion.\r\n\r\nIf Esmond had wanted to keep this secret, he could not; for a day or\r\ntwo after receiving this letter, a notice from Bruxelles appeared in\r\nthe Post-Boy and other prints, announcing that \xe2\x80\x9ca young Irish lord, the\r\nViscount C-stlew--d, just come to his majority, and who had served the\r\nlast campaigns with great credit, as aide-de-camp to his Grace the Duke\r\nof Marlborough, had declared for the Popish religion at Bruxelles, and\r\nhad walked in a procession barefoot, with a wax-taper in his hand.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nnotorious Mr. Holt, who had been employed as a Jacobite agent during\r\nthe last reign, and many times pardoned by King William, had been, the\r\nPost-Boy said, the agent of this conversion.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Castlewood was as much cast down by this news as Miss Beatrix\r\nwas indignant at it. \xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cCastlewood is no longer a home\r\nfor us, mother. Frank's foreign wife will bring her confessor, and there\r\nwill be frogs for dinner; and all Tusher's and my grandfather's sermons\r\nare flung away upon my brother. I used to tell you that you killed him\r\nwith the catechism, and that he would turn wicked as soon as he broke\r\nfrom his mammy's leading-strings. Oh, mother, you would not believe that\r\nthe young scapegrace was playing you tricks, and that sneak of a Tusher\r\nwas not a fit guide for him. Oh, those parsons, I hate 'em all!\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nMistress Beatrix, clapping her hands together; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, whether they wear\r\ncassocks and buckles, or beards and bare feet. There's a horrid Irish\r\nwretch who never misses a Sunday at Court, and who pays me compliments\r\nthere, the horrible man; and if you want to know what parsons are, you\r\nshould see his behavior, and hear him talk of his own cloth. They're all\r\nthe same, whether they're bishops, or bonzes, or Indian fakirs. They\r\ntry to domineer, and they frighten us with kingdom come; and they wear a\r\nsanctified air in public, and expect us to go down on our knees and ask\r\ntheir blessing; and they intrigue, and they grasp, and they backbite,\r\nand they slander worse than the worst courtier or the wickedest old\r\nwoman. I heard this Mr. Swift sneering at my Lord Duke of Marlborough's\r\ncourage the other day. He! that Teague from Dublin! because his Grace is\r\nnot in favor, dares to say this of him; and he says this that it may get\r\nto her Majesty's ear, and to coax and wheedle Mrs. Masham. They say\r\nthe Elector of Hanover has a dozen of mistresses in his court at\r\nHerrenhausen, and if he comes to be king over us, I wager that the\r\nbishops and Mr. Swift, that wants to be one, will coax and wheedle them.\r\nOh, those priests and their grave airs! I'm sick of their square toes\r\nand their rustling cassocks. I should like to go to a country where\r\nthere was not one, or turn Quaker, and get rid of 'em; and I would, only\r\nthe dress is not becoming, and I've much too pretty a figure to hide\r\nit. Haven't I, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d and here she glanced at her person and the\r\nlooking-glass, which told her rightly that a more beautiful shape and\r\nface never were seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made that onslaught on the priests,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Beatrix, afterwards,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin order to divert my poor dear mother's anguish about Frank. Frank is\r\nas vain as a girl, cousin. Talk of us girls being vain, what are WE to\r\nyou? It was easy to see that the first woman who chose would make a fool\r\nof him, or the first robe--I count a priest and a woman all the same. We\r\nare always caballing; we are not answerable for the fibs we tell; we are\r\nalways cajoling and coaxing, or threatening; and we are always making\r\nmischief, Colonel Esmond--mark my word for that, who know the world,\r\nsir, and have to make my way in it. I see as well as possible how\r\nFrank's marriage hath been managed. The Count, our papa-in-law, is\r\nalways away at the coffee-house. The Countess, our mother, is always in\r\nthe kitchen looking after the dinner. The Countess, our sister, is at\r\nthe spinet. When my lord comes to say he is going on the campaign, the\r\nlovely Clotilda bursts into tears, and faints--so; he catches her in his\r\narms--no, sir, keep your distance, cousin, if you please--she cries\r\non his shoulder, and he says, 'Oh, my divine, my adored, my beloved\r\nClotilda, are you sorry to part with me?' 'Oh, my Francisco,' says\r\nshe, 'oh my lord!' and at this very instant mamma and a couple of young\r\nbrothers, with moustaches and long rapiers, come in from the kitchen,\r\nwhere they have been eating bread and onions. Mark my word, you will\r\nhave all this woman's relations at Castlewood three months after she has\r\narrived there. The old count and countess, and the young counts and all\r\nthe little countesses her sisters. Counts! every one of these wretches\r\nsays he is a count. Guiscard, that stabbed Mr. Harvey, said he was\r\na count; and I believe he was a barber. All Frenchmen are\r\nbarbers--Fiddledee! don't contradict me--or else dancing-masters, or\r\nelse priests.\xe2\x80\x9d And so she rattled on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it taught YOU to dance, Cousin Beatrix?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel.\r\n\r\nShe laughed out the air of a minuet, and swept a low curtsy, coming up\r\nto the recover with the prettiest little foot in the world pointed out.\r\nHer mother came in as she was in this attitude; my lady had been in her\r\ncloset, having taken poor Frank's conversion in a very serious way; the\r\nmadcap girl ran up to her mother, put her arms round her waist, kissed\r\nher, tried to make her dance, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon't be silly, you kind little\r\nmamma, and cry about Frank turning Papist. What a figure he must be,\r\nwith a white sheet and a candle, walking in a procession barefoot!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe kicked off her little slippers (the wonderfullest little shoes\r\nwith wonderful tall red heels: Esmond pounced upon one as it fell close\r\nbeside him), and she put on the drollest little moue, and marched up and\r\ndown the room holding Esmond's cane by way of taper. Serious as her mood\r\nwas, Lady Castlewood could not refrain from laughing; and as for\r\nEsmond he looked on with that delight with which the sight of this fair\r\ncreature always inspired him: never had he seen any woman so arch, so\r\nbrilliant, and so beautiful.\r\n\r\nHaving finished her march, she put out her foot for her slipper. The\r\nColonel knelt down: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will be Pope I will turn Papist,\xe2\x80\x9d says he;\r\nand her Holiness gave him gracious leave to kiss the little stockinged\r\nfoot before he put the slipper on.\r\n\r\nMamma's feet began to pat on the floor during this operation, and\r\nBeatrix, whose bright eyes nothing escaped, saw that little mark of\r\nimpatience. She ran up and embraced her mother, with her usual cry of,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you silly little mamma: your feet are quite as pretty as mine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says she: \xe2\x80\x9cthey are, cousin, though she hides 'em; but the shoemaker\r\nwill tell you that he makes for both off the same last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are taller than I am, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d says her mother, blushing over her\r\nwhole sweet face--\xe2\x80\x9cand--and it is your hand, my dear, and not your foot\r\nhe wants you to give him;\xe2\x80\x9d and she said it with a hysteric laugh, that\r\nhad more of tears than laughter in it; laying her head on her daughter's\r\nfair shoulder, and hiding it there. They made a very pretty picture\r\ntogether, and looked like a pair of sisters--the sweet simple matron\r\nseeming younger than her years, and her daughter, if not older, yet\r\nsomehow, from a commanding manner and grace which she possessed above\r\nmost women, her mother's superior and protectress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut oh!\xe2\x80\x9d cries my mistress, recovering herself after this scene, and\r\nreturning to her usual sad tone, \xe2\x80\x9c'tis a shame that we should laugh\r\nand be making merry on a day when we ought to be down on our knees and\r\nasking pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsking pardon for what?\xe2\x80\x9d says saucy Mrs. Beatrix--\xe2\x80\x9cbecause Frank takes\r\nit into his head to fast on Fridays and worship images? You know if you\r\nhad been born a Papist, mother, a Papist you would have remained to the\r\nend of your days. 'Tis the religion of the King and of some of the best\r\nquality. For my part, I'm no enemy to it, and think Queen Bess was not a\r\npenny better than Queen Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Beatrix! Do not jest with sacred things, and remember of what\r\nparentage you come,\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lady. Beatrix was ordering her ribbons,\r\nand adjusting her tucker, and performing a dozen provokingly pretty\r\nceremonies, before the glass. The girl was no hypocrite at least. She\r\nnever at that time could be brought to think but of the world and her\r\nbeauty; and seemed to have no more sense of devotion than some people\r\nhave of music, that cannot distinguish one air from another. Esmond\r\nsaw this fault in her, as he saw many others--a bad wife would Beatrix\r\nEsmond make, he thought, for any man under the degree of a Prince. She\r\nwas born to shine in great assemblies, and to adorn palaces, and to\r\ncommand everywhere--to conduct an intrigue of politics, or to glitter in\r\na queen's train. But to sit at a homely table, and mend the stockings of\r\na poor man's children! that was no fitting duty for her, or at least\r\none that she wouldn't have broke her heart in trying to do. She was a\r\nprincess, though she had scarce a shilling to her fortune; and one\r\nof her subjects--the most abject and devoted wretch, sure, that ever\r\ndrivelled at a woman's knees--was this unlucky gentleman; who bound his\r\ngood sense, and reason, and independence, hand and foot, and submitted\r\nthem to her.\r\n\r\nAnd who does not know how ruthlessly women will tyrannize when they are\r\nlet to domineer? and who does not know how useless advice is? I could\r\ngive good counsel to my descendants, but I know they'll follow their own\r\nway, for all their grandfather's sermon. A man gets his own experience\r\nabout women, and will take nobody's hearsay; nor, indeed, is the young\r\nfellow worth a fig that would. 'Tis I that am in love with my mistress,\r\nnot my old grandmother that counsels me: 'tis I that have fixed the\r\nvalue of the thing I would have, and know the price I would pay for\r\nit. It may be worthless to you, but 'tis all my life to me. Had Esmond\r\npossessed the Great Mogul's crown and all his diamonds, or all the Duke\r\nof Marlborough's money, or all the ingots sunk at Vigo, he would have\r\ngiven them all for this woman. A fool he was, if you will; but so is\r\na sovereign a fool, that will give half a principality for a little\r\ncrystal as big as a pigeon's egg, and called a diamond: so is a wealthy\r\nnobleman a fool, that will face danger or death, and spend half his\r\nlife, and all his tranquillity, caballing for a blue ribbon; so is a\r\nDutch merchant a fool, that hath been known to pay ten thousand crowns\r\nfor a tulip. There's some particular prize we all of us value, and that\r\nevery man of spirit will venture his life for. With this, it may be\r\nto achieve a great reputation for learning; with that, to be a man of\r\nfashion, and the admiration of the town; with another, to consummate a\r\ngreat work of art or poetry, and go to immortality that way; and with\r\nanother, for a certain time of his life, the sole object and aim is a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nWhilst Esmond was under the domination of this passion, he remembers\r\nmany a talk he had with his intimates, who used to rally Our Knight of\r\nthe Rueful Countenance at his devotion, whereof he made no disguise, to\r\nBeatrix; and it was with replies such as the above he met his friends'\r\nsatire. \xe2\x80\x9cGranted, I am a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cand no better than you; but\r\nyou are no better than I. You have your folly you labor for; give me the\r\ncharity of mine. What flatteries do you, Mr. St. John, stoop to whisper\r\nin the ears of a queen's favorite? What nights of labor doth not the\r\nlaziest man in the world endure, foregoing his bottle, and his boon\r\ncompanions, foregoing Lais, in whose lap he would like to be yawning,\r\nthat he may prepare a speech full of lies, to cajole three hundred\r\nstupid country-gentlemen in the House of Commons, and get the hiccupping\r\ncheers of the October Club! What days will you spend in your jolting\r\nchariot.\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Esmond often rode to Windsor, and especially, of later\r\ndays, with the secretary.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat hours will you pass on your gouty\r\nfeet--and how humbly will you kneel down to present a despatch--you, the\r\nproudest man in the world, that has not knelt to God since you were a\r\nboy, and in that posture whisper, flatter, adore almost, a stupid woman,\r\nthat's often boozy with too much meat and drink, when Mr. Secretary goes\r\nfor his audience! If my pursuit is vanity, sure yours is too.\xe2\x80\x9d And then\r\nthe Secretary, would fly out in such a rich flow of eloquence, as this\r\npen cannot pretend to recall; advocating his scheme of ambition, showing\r\nthe great good he would do for his country when he was the undisputed\r\nchief of it; backing his opinion with a score of pat sentences from\r\nGreek and Roman authorities (of which kind of learning he made rather\r\nan ostentatious display), and scornfully vaunting the very arts and\r\nmeannesses by which fools were to be made to follow him, opponents to be\r\nbribed or silenced, doubters converted, and enemies overawed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Diogenes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is taken up for a ride\r\nin Alexander's chariot. I have no desire to vanquish Darius or to tame\r\nBucephalus. I do not want what you want, a great name or a high place:\r\nto have them would bring me no pleasure. But my moderation is taste, not\r\nvirtue; and I know that what I do want is as vain as that which you long\r\nafter. Do not grudge me my vanity, if I allow yours; or rather, let us\r\nlaugh at both indifferently, and at ourselves, and at each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your charmer holds out,\xe2\x80\x9d says St. John, \xe2\x80\x9cat this rate she may\r\nkeep you twenty years besieging her, and surrender by the time you are\r\nseventy, and she is old enough to be a grandmother. I do not say the\r\npursuit of a particular woman is not as pleasant a pastime as any other\r\nkind of hunting,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9conly, for my part, I find the game won't\r\nrun long enough. They knock under too soon--that's the fault I find with\r\n'em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe game which you pursue is in the habit of being caught, and used to\r\nbeing pulled down,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Dulcinea del Toboso is peerless, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d says the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, honest\r\nHarry, go and attack windmills--perhaps thou art not more mad than other\r\npeople,\xe2\x80\x9d St. John added, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA PAPER OUT OF THE \xe2\x80\x9cSPECTATOR.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDoth any young gentleman of my progeny, who may read his old\r\ngrandfather's papers, chance to be presently suffering under the passion\r\nof Love? There is a humiliating cure, but one that is easy and almost\r\nspecific for the malady--which is, to try an alibi. Esmond went away\r\nfrom his mistress and was cured a half-dozen times; he came back to her\r\nside, and instantly fell ill again of the fever. He vowed that he could\r\nleave her and think no more of her, and so he could pretty well, at\r\nleast, succeed in quelling that rage and longing he had whenever he was\r\nwith her; but as soon as he returned he was as bad as ever again. Truly\r\na ludicrous and pitiable object, at least exhausting everybody's pity\r\nbut his dearest mistress's, Lady Castlewood's, in whose tender breast he\r\nreposed all his dreary confessions, and who never tired of hearing him\r\nand pleading for him.\r\n\r\nSometimes Esmond would think there was hope. Then again he would be\r\nplagued with despair, at some impertinence or coquetry of his mistress.\r\nFor days they would be like brother and sister, or the dearest\r\nfriends--she, simple, fond, and charming--he, happy beyond measure at\r\nher good behavior. But this would all vanish on a sudden. Either he\r\nwould be too pressing, and hint his love, when she would rebuff him\r\ninstantly, and give his vanity a box on the ear; or he would be jealous,\r\nand with perfect good reason, of some new admirer that had sprung up,\r\nor some rich young gentleman newly arrived in the town, that this\r\nincorrigible flirt would set her nets and baits to draw in. If Esmond\r\nremonstrated, the little rebel would say--\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you? I shall go my\r\nown way, sirrah, and that way is towards a husband, and I don't want\r\nYOU on the way. I am for your betters, Colonel, for your betters: do\r\nyou hear that? You might do if you had an estate and were younger; only\r\neight years older than I, you say! pish, you are a hundred years older.\r\nYou are an old, old Graveairs, and I should make you miserable, that\r\nwould be the only comfort I should have in marrying you. But you have\r\nnot money enough to keep a cat decently after you have paid your man his\r\nwages, and your landlady her bill. Do you think I am going to live in\r\na lodging, and turn the mutton at a string whilst your honor nurses the\r\nbaby? Fiddlestick, and why did you not get this nonsense knocked out of\r\nyour head when you were in the wars? You are come back more dismal and\r\ndreary than ever. You and mamma are fit for each other. You might be\r\nDarby and Joan, and play cribbage to the end of your lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least you own to your worldliness, my poor Trix,\xe2\x80\x9d says her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorldliness. Oh, my pretty lady! Do you think that I am a child in the\r\nnursery, and to be frightened by Bogey! Worldliness, to be sure; and\r\npray, madam, where is the harm of wishing to be comfortable? When you\r\nare gone, you dearest old woman, or when I am tired of you and have\r\nrun away from you, where shall I go? Shall I go and be head nurse to my\r\nPopish sister-in-law, take the children their physic, and whip 'em,\r\nand put 'em to bed when they are naughty? Shall I be Castlewood's upper\r\nservant, and perhaps marry Tom Tusher? Merci! I have been long enough\r\nFrank's humble servant. Why am I not a man? I have ten times his brains,\r\nand had I worn the--well, don't let your ladyship be frightened--had\r\nI worn a sword and periwig instead of this mantle and commode to which\r\nnature has condemned me--(though 'tis a pretty stuff, too--Cousin\r\nEsmond! you will go to the Exchange to-morrow, and get the exact\r\ncounterpart of this ribbon, sir; do you hear?)--I would have made our\r\nname talked about. So would Graveairs here have made something out of\r\nour name if he had represented it. My Lord Graveairs would have done\r\nvery well. Yes, you have a very pretty way, and would have made a very\r\ndecent, grave speaker.\xe2\x80\x9d And here she began to imitate Esmond's way of\r\ncarrying himself and speaking to his face, and so ludicrously that his\r\nmistress burst out a-laughing, and even he himself could see there was\r\nsome likeness in the fantastical malicious caricature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cI solemnly vow, own, and confess, that I want a\r\ngood husband. Where's the harm of one? My face is my fortune. Who'll\r\ncome?--buy, buy, buy! I cannot toil, neither can I spin, but I can play\r\ntwenty-three games on the cards. I can dance the last dance, I can hunt\r\nthe stag, and I think I could shoot flying. I can talk as wicked as any\r\nwoman of my years, and know enough stories to amuse a sulky husband for\r\nat least one thousand and one nights. I have a pretty taste for dress,\r\ndiamonds, gambling, and old China. I love sugar-plums, Malines lace\r\n(that you brought me, cousin, is very pretty), the opera, and everything\r\nthat is useless and costly. I have got a monkey and a little\r\nblack boy--Pompey, sir, go and give a dish of chocolate to Colonel\r\nGraveairs,--and a parrot and a spaniel, and I must have a husband.\r\nCupid, you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIss, Missis!\xe2\x80\x9d says Pompey, a little grinning negro Lord Peterborrow\r\ngave her, with a bird of Paradise in his turbant, and a collar with his\r\nmistress's name on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIss, Missis!\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, imitating the child. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if husband not\r\ncome, Pompey must go fetch one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Pompey went away grinning with his chocolate tray as Miss Beatrix\r\nran up to her mother and ended her sally of mischief in her common way,\r\nwith a kiss--no wonder that upon paying such a penalty her fond judge\r\npardoned her.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Esmond came home, his health was still shattered; and he took a\r\nlodging near to his mistresses, at Kensington, glad enough to be served\r\nby them, and to see them day after day. He was enabled to see a little\r\ncompany--and of the sort he liked best. Mr. Steele and Mr. Addison both\r\ndid him the honor to visit him; and drank many a glass of good claret\r\nat his lodging, whilst their entertainer, through his wound, was kept to\r\ndiet drink and gruel. These gentlemen were Whigs, and great admirers of\r\nmy Lord Duke of Marlborough; and Esmond was entirely of the other party.\r\nBut their different views of politics did not prevent the gentlemen from\r\nagreeing in private, nor from allowing, on one evening when Esmond's\r\nkind old patron, Lieutenant-General Webb, with a stick and a crutch,\r\nhobbled up to the Colonel's lodging (which was prettily situate at\r\nKnightsbridge, between London and Kensington, and looking over\r\nthe Gardens), that the Lieutenant-General was a noble and gallant\r\nsoldier--and even that he had been hardly used in the Wynendael affair.\r\nHe took his revenge in talk, that must be confessed; and if Mr. Addison\r\nhad had a mind to write a poem about Wynendael, he might have heard from\r\nthe commander's own lips the story a hundred times over.\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond, forced to be quiet, betook himself to literature for a\r\nrelaxation, and composed his comedy, whereof the prompter's copy lieth\r\nin my walnut escritoire, sealed up and docketed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Faithful Fool,\r\na Comedy, as it was performed by her Majesty's Servants.\xe2\x80\x9d 'Twas a\r\nvery sentimental piece; and Mr. Steele, who had more of that kind of\r\nsentiment than Mr. Addison, admired it, whilst the other rather sneered\r\nat the performance; though he owned that, here and there, it contained\r\nsome pretty strokes. He was bringing out his own play of \xe2\x80\x9cCato\xe2\x80\x9d at the\r\ntime, the blaze of which quite extinguished Esmond's farthing candle;\r\nand his name was never put to the piece, which was printed as by a\r\nPerson of Quality. Only nine copies were sold, though Mr. Dennis, the\r\ngreat critic, praised it, and said 'twas a work of great merit; and\r\nColonel Esmond had the whole impression burned one day in a rage, by\r\nJack Lockwood, his man.\r\n\r\nAll this comedy was full of bitter satiric strokes against a certain\r\nyoung lady. The plot of the piece was quite a new one. A young woman was\r\nrepresented with a great number of suitors, selecting a pert fribble of\r\na peer, in place of the hero (but ill-acted, I think, by Mr. Wilks,\r\nthe Faithful Fool,) who persisted in admiring her. In the fifth act,\r\nTeraminta was made to discover the merits of Eugenio (the F. F.), and\r\nto feel a partiality for him too late; for he announced that he had\r\nbestowed his hand and estate upon Rosaria, a country lass, endowed with\r\nevery virtue. But it must be owned that the audience yawned through the\r\nplay; and that it perished on the third night, with only half a dozen\r\npersons to behold its agonies. Esmond and his two mistresses came to the\r\nfirst night, and Miss Beatrix fell asleep; whilst her mother, who had\r\nnot been to a play since King James the Second's time, thought the\r\npiece, though not brilliant, had a very pretty moral.\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond dabbled in letters, and wrote a deal of prose and verse at\r\nthis time of leisure. When displeased with the conduct of Miss Beatrix,\r\nhe would compose a satire, in which he relieved his mind. When smarting\r\nunder the faithlessness of women, he dashed off a copy of verses, in\r\nwhich he held the whole sex up to scorn. One day, in one of these moods,\r\nhe made a little joke, in which (swearing him to secrecy) he got his\r\nfriend Dick Steele to help him; and, composing a paper, he had it\r\nprinted exactly like Steele's paper, and by his printer, and laid on his\r\nmistress's breakfast-table the following--\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cSPECTATOR.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNo. 341.                    \xe2\x80\x9cTuesday, April 1, 1712.\r\n\r\n     Mutato nomine de te Fabula narratur.--HORACE.\r\n     Thyself the morain of the fable see.--CREECH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJocasta is known as a woman of learning and fashion, and as one of\r\nthe most amiable persons of this court and country. She is at home two\r\nmornings of the week, and all the wits and a few of the beauties of\r\nLondon flock to her assemblies. When she goes abroad to Tunbridge or the\r\nBath, a retinue of adorers rides the journey with her; and besides\r\nthe London beaux, she has a crowd of admirers at the Wells, the\r\npolite amongst the natives of Sussex and Somerset pressing round her\r\ntea-tables, and being anxious for a nod from her chair. Jocasta's\r\nacquaintance is thus very numerous. Indeed, 'tis one smart writer's work\r\nto keep her visiting-book--a strong footman is engaged to carry it;\r\nand it would require a much stronger head even than Jocasta's own to\r\nremember the names of all her dear friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither at Epsom Wells or at Tunbridge (for of this important matter\r\nJocasta cannot be certain) it was her ladyship's fortune to become\r\nacquainted with a young gentleman, whose conversation was so sprightly,\r\nand manners amiable, that she invited the agreeable young spark to visit\r\nher if ever he came to London, where her house in Spring Garden should\r\nbe open to him. Charming as he was, and without any manner of doubt\r\na pretty fellow, Jocasta hath such a regiment of the like continually\r\nmarching round her standard, that 'tis no wonder her attention\r\nis distracted amongst them. And so, though this gentleman made a\r\nconsiderable impression upon her, and touched her heart for at least\r\nthree-and-twenty minutes, it must be owned that she has forgotten his\r\nname. He is a dark man, and may be eight-and-twenty years old. His dress\r\nis sober, though of rich materials. He has a mole on his forehead over\r\nhis left eye; has a blue ribbon to his cane and sword, and wears his own\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJocasta was much flattered by beholding her admirer (for that everybody\r\nadmires who sees her is a point which she never can for a moment doubt)\r\nin the next pew to her at St. James's Church last Sunday; and the manner\r\nin which he appeared to go to sleep during the sermon--though from under\r\nhis fringed eyelids it was evident he was casting glances of respectful\r\nrapture towards Jocasta--deeply moved and interested her. On coming out\r\nof church, he found his way to her chair, and made her an elegant bow as\r\nshe stepped into it. She saw him at Court afterwards, where he carried\r\nhimself with a most distinguished air, though none of her acquaintances\r\nknew his name; and the next night he was at the play, where her ladyship\r\nwas pleased to acknowledge him from the side-box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the whole of the comedy she racked her brains so to remember his\r\nname that she did not hear a word of the piece: and having the happiness\r\nto meet him once more in the lobby of the playhouse, she went up to\r\nhim in a flutter, and bade him remember that she kept two nights in the\r\nweek, and that she longed to see him at Spring Garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe appeared on Tuesday, in a rich suit, showing a very fine taste both\r\nin the tailor and wearer; and though a knot of us were gathered round\r\nthe charming Jocasta, fellows who pretended to know every face upon\r\nthe town, not one could tell the gentleman's name in reply to Jocasta's\r\neager inquiries, flung to the right and left of her as he advanced up\r\nthe room with a bow that would become a duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJocasta acknowledged this salute with one of those smiles and curtsies\r\nof which that lady hath the secret. She curtsies with a languishing air,\r\nas if to say, 'You are come at last. I have been pining for you:' and\r\nthen she finishes her victim with a killing look, which declares: 'O\r\nPhilander! I have no eyes but for you.' Camilla hath as good a curtsy\r\nperhaps, and Thalestris much such another look; but the glance and the\r\ncurtsy together belong to Jocasta of all the English beauties alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Welcome to London, sir,' says she. 'One can see you are from the\r\ncountry by your looks.' She would have said 'Epsom,' or 'Tunbridge,'\r\nhad she remembered rightly at which place she had met the stranger; but,\r\nalas! she had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman said, 'he had been in town but three days; and one of his\r\nreasons for coming hither was to have the honor of paying his court to\r\nJocasta.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said, 'the waters had agreed with her but indifferently.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The waters were for the sick,' the gentleman said: 'the young and\r\nbeautiful came but to make them sparkle. And as the clergyman read the\r\nservice on Sunday,' he added, 'your ladyship reminded me of the angel\r\nthat visited the pool.' A murmur of approbation saluted this sally.\r\nManilio, who is a wit when he is not at cards, was in such a rage that\r\nhe revoked when he heard it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJocasta was an angel visiting the waters; but at which of the\r\nBethesdas? She was puzzled more and more; and, as her way always is,\r\nlooked the more innocent and simple, the more artful her intentions\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'We were discoursing,' says she, 'about spelling of names and words\r\nwhen you came. Why should we say goold and write gold, and call china\r\nchayney, and Cavendish Candish, and Cholmondeley Chumley? If we call\r\nPulteney Poltney, why shouldn't we call poultry pultry--and--'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Such an enchantress as your ladyship,' says he, 'is mistress of all\r\nsorts of spells.' But this was Dr. Swift's pun, and we all knew it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And--and how do you spell your name?' says she, coming to the point at\r\nlength; for this sprightly conversation had lasted much longer than is\r\nhere set down, and been carried on through at least three dishes of tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Oh, madam,' says he, 'I SPELL MY NAME WITH THE Y.' And laying down his\r\ndish, my gentleman made another elegant bow, and was gone in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJocasta hath had no sleep since this mortification, and the stranger's\r\ndisappearance. If balked in anything, she is sure to lose her health and\r\ntemper; and we, her servants, suffer, as usual, during the angry fits of\r\nour Queen. Can you help us, Mr. Spectator, who know everything, to read\r\nthis riddle for her, and set at rest all our minds? We find in her list,\r\nMr. Berty, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pike, Mr. Tyler--who may be Mr. Bertie, Mr.\r\nSmyth, Mr. Pyke, Mr. Tiler, for what we know. She hath turned away\r\nthe clerk of her visiting-book, a poor fellow with a great family of\r\nchildren. Read me this riddle, good Mr. Shortface, and oblige your\r\nadmirer--OEDIPUS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE TRUMPET COFFEE-HOUSE, WHITEHALL.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMR. SPECTATOR,--I am a gentleman but little acquainted with the town,\r\nthough I have had a university education, and passed some years\r\nserving my country abroad, where my name is better known than in the\r\ncoffee-house and St. James's.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years since my uncle died, leaving me a pretty estate in the county\r\nof Kent; and being at Tunbridge Wells last summer, after my mourning was\r\nover, and on the look-out, if truth must be told, for some young lady\r\nwho would share with me the solitude of my great Kentish house, and be\r\nkind to my tenantry (for whom a woman can do a great deal more good than\r\nthe best-intentioned man can), I was greatly fascinated by a young lady\r\nof London, who was the toast of all the company at the Wells. Every one\r\nknows Saccharissa's beauty; and I think, Mr. Spectator, no one better\r\nthan herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy table-book informs me that I danced no less than seven-and-twenty\r\nsets with her at the Assembly. I treated her to the fiddles twice. I\r\nwas admitted on several days to her lodging, and received by her with a\r\ngreat deal of distinction, and, for a time, was entirely her slave. It\r\nwas only when I found, from common talk of the company at the Wells, and\r\nfrom narrowly watching one, who I once thought of asking the most sacred\r\nquestion a man can put to a woman, that I became aware how unfit she was\r\nto be a country gentleman's wife; and that this fair creature was but a\r\nheartless worldly jilt, playing with affections that she never meant to\r\nreturn, and, indeed, incapable of returning them. 'Tis admiration such\r\nwomen want, not love that touches them; and I can conceive, in her old\r\nage, no more wretched creature than this lady will be, when her beauty\r\nhath deserted her, when her admirers have left her, and she hath neither\r\nfriendship nor religion to console her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness calling me to London, I went to St. James's Church last\r\nSunday, and there opposite me sat my beauty of the Wells. Her behavior\r\nduring the whole service was so pert, languishing, and absurd; she\r\nflirted her fan, and ogled and eyed me in a manner so indecent, that I\r\nwas obliged to shut my eyes, so as actually not to see her, and whenever\r\nI opened them beheld hers (and very bright they are) still staring at\r\nme. I fell in with her afterwards at Court, and at the playhouse; and\r\nhere nothing would satisfy her but she must elbow through the crowd\r\nand speak to me, and invite me to the assembly, which she holds at her\r\nhouse, not very far from Ch-r-ng Cr-ss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving made her a promise to attend, of course I kept my promise; and\r\nfound the young widow in the midst of a half-dozen of card tables, and\r\na crowd of wits and admirers. I made the best bow I could, and advanced\r\ntowards her; and saw by a peculiar puzzled look in her face, though she\r\ntried to hide her perplexity, that she had forgotten even my name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer talk, artful as it was, convinced me that I had guessed aright. She\r\nturned the conversation most ridiculously upon the spelling of names and\r\nwords; and I replied with as ridiculous fulsome compliments as I could\r\npay her: indeed, one in which I compared her to an angel visiting the\r\nsick wells, went a little too far; nor should I have employed it, but\r\nthat the allusion came from the Second Lesson last Sunday, which we both\r\nhad heard, and I was pressed to answer her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she came to the question, which I knew was awaiting me, and asked\r\nhow I SPELT my name? 'Madam,' says I, turning on my heel, 'I spell it\r\nwith a Y.' And so I left her, wondering at the light-heartedness of the\r\ntown-people, who forget and make friends so easily, and resolved to look\r\nelsewhere for a partner for your constant reader,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCYMON WYLDOATS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know my real name, Mr. Spectator, in which there is no such a\r\nletter as HUPSILON. But if the lady, whom I have called Saccharissa,\r\nwonders that I appear no more at the tea-tables, she is hereby\r\nrespectfully informed the reason Y.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above is a parable, whereof the writer will now expound the meaning.\r\nJocasta was no other than Miss Esmond, Maid of Honor to her Majesty.\r\nShe had told Mr. Esmond this little story of having met a gentleman\r\nsomewhere, and forgetting his name, when the gentleman, with no such\r\nmalicious intentions as those of \xe2\x80\x9cCymon\xe2\x80\x9d in the above fable, made the\r\nanswer simply as above; and we all laughed to think how little Mistress\r\nJocasta-Beatrix had profited by her artifice and precautions.\r\n\r\nAs for Cymon, he was intended to represent yours and her very humble\r\nservant, the writer of the apologue and of this story, which we had\r\nprinted on a \xe2\x80\x9cSpectator\xe2\x80\x9d paper at Mr. Steele's office, exactly as\r\nthose famous journals were printed, and which was laid on the table\r\nat breakfast in place of the real newspaper. Mistress Jocasta, who had\r\nplenty of wit, could not live without her Spectator to her tea; and\r\nthis sham Spectator was intended to convey to the young woman that\r\nshe herself was a flirt, and that Cymon was a gentleman of honor and\r\nresolution, seeing all her faults, and determined to break the chains\r\nonce and for ever.\r\n\r\nFor though enough hath been said about this love-business\r\nalready--enough, at least, to prove to the writer's heirs what a silly\r\nfond fool their old grandfather was, who would like them to consider him\r\nas a very wise old gentleman; yet not near all has been told concerning\r\nthis matter, which, if it were allowed to take in Esmond's journal the\r\nspace it occupied in his time, would weary his kinsmen and women of a\r\nhundred years' time beyond all endurance; and form such a diary of folly\r\nand drivelling, raptures and rage, as no man of ordinary vanity would\r\nlike to leave behind him.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that, whether she laughed at him or encouraged him;\r\nwhether she smiled or was cold, and turned her smiles on another;\r\nworldly and ambitious, as he knew her to be; hard and careless, as she\r\nseemed to grow with her court life, and a hundred admirers that came to\r\nher and left her; Esmond, do what he would, never could get Beatrix out\r\nof his mind; thought of her constantly at home or away. If he read his\r\nname in a Gazette, or escaped the shot of a cannon-ball or a greater\r\ndanger in the campaign, as has happened to him more than once, the\r\ninstant thought after the honor achieved or the danger avoided, was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will SHE say of it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWill this distinction or the idea of this\r\nperil elate her or touch her, so as to be better inclined towards me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He could no more help this passionate fidelity of temper than he could\r\nhelp the eyes he saw with--one or the other seemed a part of his nature;\r\nand knowing every one of her faults as well as the keenest of her\r\ndetractors, and the folly of an attachment to such a woman, of which the\r\nfruition could never bring him happiness for above a week, there was yet\r\na charm about this Circe from which the poor deluded gentleman could\r\nnot free himself; and for a much longer period than Ulysses (another\r\nmiddle-aged officer, who had travelled much, and been in the foreign\r\nwars,) Esmond felt himself enthralled and besotted by the wiles of this\r\nenchantress. Quit her! He could no more quit her, as the Cymon of\r\nthis story was made to quit his false one, than he could lose his\r\nconsciousness of yesterday. She had but to raise her finger, and he\r\nwould come back from ever so far; she had but to say I have discarded\r\nsuch and such an adorer, and the poor infatuated wretch would be sure to\r\ncome and roder about her mother's house, willing to be put on the ranks\r\nof suitors, though he knew he might be cast off the next week. If he\r\nwere like Ulysses in his folly, at least she was in so far like Penelope\r\nthat she had a crowd of suitors, and undid day after day and night after\r\nnight the handiwork of fascination and the web of coquetry with which\r\nshe was wont to allure and entertain them.\r\n\r\nPart of her coquetry may have come from her position about the Court,\r\nwhere the beautiful maid of honor was the light about which a thousand\r\nbeaux came and fluttered; where she was sure to have a ring of admirers\r\nround her, crowding to listen to her repartees as much as to admire her\r\nbeauty; and where she spoke and listened to much free talk, such as\r\none never would have thought the lips or ears of Rachel Castlewood's\r\ndaughter would have uttered or heard. When in waiting at Windsor or\r\nHampton, the Court ladies and gentlemen would be making riding parties\r\ntogether; Mrs. Beatrix in a horseman's coat and hat, the foremost after\r\nthe stag-hounds and over the park fences, a crowd of young fellows at\r\nher heels. If the English country ladies at this time were the most pure\r\nand modest of any ladies in the world--the English town and court ladies\r\npermitted themselves words and behavior that were neither modest nor\r\npure; and claimed, some of them, a freedom which those who love that\r\nsex most would never wish to grant them. The gentlemen of my family that\r\nfollow after me (for I don't encourage the ladies to pursue any such\r\nstudies), may read in the works of Mr. Congreve, and Dr. Swift and\r\nothers, what was the conversation and what the habits of our time.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful woman in England in 1712, when Esmond returned to\r\nthis country, a lady of high birth, and though of no fortune to be sure,\r\nwith a thousand fascinations of wit and manners, Beatrix Esmond was\r\nnow six-and-twenty years old, and Beatrix Esmond still. Of her hundred\r\nadorers she had not chosen one for a husband; and those who had asked\r\nhad been jilted by her; and more still had left her. A succession of\r\nnear ten years' crops of beauties had come up since her time, and had\r\nbeen reaped by proper HUSBANDmen, if we may make an agricultural simile,\r\nand had been housed comfortably long ago. Her own contemporaries were\r\nsober mothers by this time; girls with not a tithe of her charms, or\r\nher wit, having made good matches, and now claiming precedence over\r\nthe spinster who but lately had derided and outshone them. The young\r\nbeauties were beginning to look down on Beatrix as an old maid, and\r\nsneer, and call her one of Charles II.'s ladies, and ask whether her\r\nportrait was not in the Hampton Court Gallery? But still she reigned,\r\nat least in one man's opinion, superior over all the little misses\r\nthat were the toasts of the young lads; and in Esmond's eyes was ever\r\nperfectly lovely and young.\r\n\r\nWho knows how many were nearly made happy by possessing her, or, rather,\r\nhow many were fortunate in escaping this siren? 'Tis a marvel to think\r\nthat her mother was the purest and simplest woman in the whole world,\r\nand that this girl should have been born from her. I am inclined to\r\nfancy, my mistress, who never said a harsh word to her children (and\r\nbut twice or thrice only to one person), must have been too fond and\r\npressing with the maternal authority; for her son and her daughter both\r\nrevolted early; nor after their first flight from the nest could they\r\never be brought back quite to the fond mother's bosom. Lady Castlewood,\r\nand perhaps it was as well, knew little of her daughter's life and real\r\nthoughts. How was she to apprehend what passes in Queen's ante-chambers\r\nand at Court tables? Mrs. Beatrix asserted her own authority so\r\nresolutely that her mother quickly gave in. The maid of honor had her\r\nown equipage; went from home and came back at her own will: her mother\r\nwas alike powerless to resist her or to lead her, or to command or to\r\npersuade her.\r\n\r\nShe had been engaged once, twice, thrice, to be married, Esmond\r\nbelieved. When he quitted home, it hath been said, she was promised to\r\nmy Lord Ashburnham, and now, on his return, behold his lordship was just\r\nmarried to Lady Mary Butler, the Duke of Ormonde's daughter, and his\r\nfine houses, and twelve thousand a year of fortune, for which Miss\r\nBeatrix had rather coveted him, was out of her power. To her Esmond\r\ncould say nothing in regard to the breaking of this match; and, asking\r\nhis mistress about it, all Lady Castlewood answered was: \xe2\x80\x9cdo not speak\r\nto me about it, Harry. I cannot tell you how or why they parted, and I\r\nfear to inquire. I have told you before, that with all her kindness, and\r\nwit, and generosity, and that sort of splendor of nature she has, I can\r\nsay but little good of poor Beatrix, and look with dread at the marriage\r\nshe will form. Her mind is fixed on ambition only, and making a\r\ngreat figure; and, this achieved, she will tire of it as she does\r\nof everything. Heaven help her husband, whoever he shall be! My Lord\r\nAshburnham was a most excellent young man, gentle and yet manly, of very\r\ngood parts, so they told me, and as my little conversation would enable\r\nme to judge: and a kind temper--kind and enduring I'm sure he must have\r\nbeen, from all that he had to endure. But he quitted her at last,\r\nfrom some crowning piece of caprice or tyranny of hers; and now he has\r\nmarried a young woman that will make him a thousand times happier than\r\nmy poor girl ever could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rupture, whatever its cause was, (I heard the scandal, but indeed\r\nshall not take pains to repeat at length in this diary the trumpery\r\ncoffee-house story,) caused a good deal of low talk; and Mr. Esmond was\r\npresent at my lord's appearance at the Birthday with his bride, over\r\nwhom the revenge that Beatrix took was to look so imperial and lovely\r\nthat the modest downcast young lady could not appear beside her, and\r\nLord Ashburnham, who had his reasons for wishing to avoid her, slunk\r\naway quite shamefaced, and very early. This time his Grace the Duke of\r\nHamilton, whom Esmond had seen about her before, was constant at Miss\r\nBeatrix's side: he was one of the most splendid gentlemen of Europe,\r\naccomplished by books, by travel, by long command of the best company,\r\ndistinguished as a statesman, having been ambassador in King Williamn's\r\ntime, and a noble speaker in the Scots' Parliament, where he had led the\r\nparty that was against the Union, and though now five or six and forty\r\nyears of age, a gentleman so high in stature, accomplished in wit, and\r\nfavored in person, that he might pretend to the hand of any Princess in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like the Duke for a cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Secretary St. John,\r\nwhispering to Colonel Esmond in French; \xe2\x80\x9cit appears that the widower\r\nconsoles himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut to return to our little Spectator paper and the conversation which\r\ngrew out of it. Miss Beatrix at first was quite BIT (as the phrase of\r\nthat day was) and did not \xe2\x80\x9csmoke\xe2\x80\x9d the authorship of the story; indeed\r\nEsmond had tried to imitate as well as he could Mr. Steele's manner\r\n(as for the other author of the Spectator, his prose style I think is\r\naltogether inimitable); and Dick, who was the idlest and best-natured of\r\nmen, would have let the piece pass into his journal and go to posterity\r\nas one of his own lucubrations, but that Esmond did not care to have\r\na lady's name whom he loved sent forth to the world in a light so\r\nunfavorable. Beatrix pished and psha'd over the paper; Colonel Esmond\r\nwatching with no little interest her countenance as she read it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid your friend Mr. Steele becomes!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Miss Beatrix. \xe2\x80\x9cEpsom\r\nand Tunbridge! Will he never have done with Epsom and Tunbridge, and\r\nwith beaux at church, and Jocastas and Lindamiras? Why does he not call\r\nwomen Nelly and Betty, as their godfathers and godmothers did for them\r\nin their baptism?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeatrix. Beatrix!\xe2\x80\x9d says her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cspeak gravely of grave things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma thinks the Church Catechism came from heaven, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says Beatrix, with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cand was brought down by a bishop from a\r\nmountain. Oh, how I used to break my heart over it! Besides, I had a\r\nPopish godmother, mamma; why did you give me one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave you the Queen's name,\xe2\x80\x9d says her mother blushing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd a very\r\npretty name it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said somebody else.\r\n\r\nBeatrix went on reading--\xe2\x80\x9cSpell my name with a Y--why, you wretch,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nshe, turning round to Colonel Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been telling my story to\r\nMr. Steele--or stop--you have written the paper yourself to turn me into\r\nridicule. For shame, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Esmond felt rather frightened, and told a truth, which was\r\nnevertheless an entire falsehood. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honor,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not\r\neven read the Spectator of this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d Nor had he, for that was not\r\nthe Spectator, but a sham newspaper put in its place.\r\n\r\nShe went on reading: her face rather flushed as she read. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you couldn't have written it. I think it must have been\r\nMr. Steele when he was drunk--and afraid of his horrid vulgar wife.\r\nWhenever I see an enormous compliment to a woman, and some outrageous\r\npanegyric about female virtue, I always feel sure that the Captain and\r\nhis better half have fallen out over-night, and that he has been brought\r\nhome tipsy, or has been found out in--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeatrix!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Lady Castlewood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mamma! Do not cry out before you are hurt. I am not going to say\r\nanything wrong. I won't give you more annoyance than you can help, you\r\npretty kind mamma. Yes, and your little Trix is a naughty little Trix,\r\nand she leaves undone those things which she ought to have done, and\r\ndoes those things which she ought not to have done, and there's--well\r\nnow--I won't go on. Yes, I will, unless you kiss me.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this the\r\nyoung lady lays aside her paper, and runs up to her mother and performs\r\na variety of embraces with her ladyship, saying as plain as eyes could\r\nspeak to Mr. Esmond--\xe2\x80\x9cThere, sir: would not YOU like to play the very\r\nsame pleasant game?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, madam, I would,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Beatrix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you meant when you looked at me in that provoking way,\xe2\x80\x9d answers\r\nEsmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a confessor!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Beatrix, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it Henry would like, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asks her mother, the kind soul,\r\nwho was always thinking what we would like, and how she could please us.\r\n\r\nThe girl runs up to her--\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you silly kind mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, kissing\r\nher again, \xe2\x80\x9cthat's what Harry would like;\xe2\x80\x9d and she broke out into a\r\ngreat joyful laugh; and Lady Castlewood blushed as bashful as a maid of\r\nsixteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at her, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d whispers Beatrix, running up, and speaking in her\r\nsweet low tones. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn't the blush become her? Isn't she pretty? She\r\nlooks younger than I am, and I am sure she is a hundred million thousand\r\ntimes better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond's kind mistress left the room, carrying her blushes away with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we girls at Court could grow such roses as that,\xe2\x80\x9d continues Beatrix,\r\nwith her laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat wouldn't we do to preserve 'em? We'd clip their\r\nstalks and put 'em in salt and water. But those flowers don't bloom\r\nat Hampton Court and Windsor, Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused for a minute, and the\r\nsmile fading away from her April face, gave place to a menacing shower\r\nof tears; \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how good she is, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d Beatrix went on to say. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nwhat a saint she is! Her goodness frightens me. I'm not fit to live with\r\nher. I should be better I think if she were not so perfect. She has had\r\na great sorrow in her life, and a great secret; and repented of it. It\r\ncould not have been my father's death. She talks freely about that; nor\r\ncould she have loved him very much--though who knows what we women do\r\nlove, and why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, and why, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one knows,\xe2\x80\x9d Beatrix went on, without noticing this interruption\r\nexcept by a look, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat my mother's life is. She hath been at early\r\nprayer this morning; she passes hours in her closet; if you were to\r\nfollow her thither, you would find her at prayers now. She tends the\r\npoor of the place--the horrid dirty poor! She sits through the curate's\r\nsermons--oh, those dreary sermons! And you see on a beau dire; but\r\ngood as they are, people like her are not fit to commune with us of the\r\nworld. There is always, as it were, a third person present, even when I\r\nand my mother are alone. She can't be frank with me quite; who is always\r\nthinking of the next world, and of her guardian angel, perhaps that's in\r\ncompany. Oh, Harry, I'm jealous of that guardian angel!\xe2\x80\x9d here broke out\r\nMistress Beatrix. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's horrid, I know; but my mother's life is all\r\nfor heaven, and mine--all for earth. We can never be friends quite; and\r\nthen, she cares more for Frank's little finger than she does for me--I\r\nknow she does: and she loves you, sir, a great deal too much; and I hate\r\nyou for it. I would have had her all to myself; but she wouldn't. In my\r\nchildhood, it was my father she loved--(oh, how could she? I remember\r\nhim kind and handsome, but so stupid, and not being able to speak after\r\ndrinking wine). And then it was Frank; and now, it is heaven and the\r\nclergyman. How I would have loved her! From a child I used to be in a\r\nrage that she loved anybody but me; but she loved you all better--all, I\r\nknow she did. And now, she talks of the blessed consolation of religion.\r\nDear soul! she thinks she is happier for believing, as she must, that\r\nwe are all of us wicked and miserable sinners; and this world is only a\r\npied-a-terre for the good, where they stay for a night, as we do, coming\r\nfrom Walcote, at that great, dreary, uncomfortable Hounslow Inn, in\r\nthose horrid beds--oh, do you remember those horrid beds?--and the\r\nchariot comes and fetches them to heaven the next morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, indeed. You are a hypocrite, too, Henry, with your grave airs\r\nand your glum face. We are all hypocrites. O dear me! We are all alone,\r\nalone, alone,\xe2\x80\x9d says poor Beatrix, her fair breast heaving with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was I that writ every line of that paper, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not so worldly as you think yourself, Beatrix, and better than\r\nwe believe you. The good we have in us we doubt of; and the happiness\r\nthat's to our hand we throw away. You bend your ambition on a great\r\nmarriage and establishment--and why? You'll tire of them when you win\r\nthem; and be no happier with a coronet on your coach--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThan riding pillion with Lubin to market,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\r\nLubin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm a dismal shepherd, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d answers Esmond, with a blush;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand require a nymph that can tuck my bed-clothes up, and make me\r\nwater-gruel. Well, Tom Lockwood can do that. He took me out of the fire\r\nupon his shoulders, and nursed me through my illness as love will scarce\r\never do. Only good wages, and a hope of my clothes, and the contents of\r\nmy portmanteau. How long was it that Jacob served an apprenticeship for\r\nRachel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is mamma your honor wants, and that I\r\nshould have the happiness of calling you papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond blushed again. \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke of a Rachel that a shepherd courted five\r\nthousand years ago; when shepherds were longer lived than now. And my\r\nmeaning was, that since I saw you first after our separation--a child\r\nyou were then . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I put on my best stockings to captivate you, I remember, sir . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had my heart ever since then, such as it was; and such as you\r\nwere, I cared for no other woman. What little reputation I have won, it\r\nwas that you might be pleased with it: and indeed, it is not much; and\r\nI think a hundred fools in the army have got and deserved quite as much.\r\nWas there something in the air of that dismal old Castlewood that made\r\nus all gloomy, and dissatisfied, and lonely under its ruined old roof?\r\nWe were all so, even when together and united, as it seemed, following\r\nour separate schemes, each as we sat round the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dreary old place!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Beatrix. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma hath never had the heart\r\nto go back thither since we left it, when--never mind how many years\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d And she flung back her curls, and looked over her fair shoulder at\r\nthe mirror superbly, as if she said, \xe2\x80\x9cTime, I defy you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, who had the art, as she owned, of divining many of\r\nher thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can afford to look in the glass still; and only be\r\npleased by the truth it tells you. As for me, do you know what my scheme\r\nis? I think of asking Frank to give me the Virginian estate King Charles\r\ngave our grandfather. (She gave a superb curtsy, as much as to say,\r\n'Our grandfather, indeed! Thank you, Mr. Bastard.') Yes, I know you are\r\nthinking of my bar-sinister, and so am I. A man cannot get over it in\r\nthis country; unless, indeed, he wears it across a king's arms, when\r\n'tis a highly honorable coat; and I am thinking of retiring into the\r\nplantations, and building myself a wigwam in the woods, and perhaps, if\r\nI want company, suiting myself with a squaw. We will send your ladyship\r\nfurs over for the winter; and, when you are old, we'll provide you with\r\ntobacco. I am not quite clever enough, or not rogue enough--I know not\r\nwhich--for the Old World. I may make a place for myself in the New,\r\nwhich is not so full; and found a family there. When you are a mother\r\nyourself, and a great lady, perhaps I shall send you over from the\r\nplantation some day a little barbarian that is half Esmond half Mohock,\r\nand you will be kind to him for his father's sake, who was, after all,\r\nyour kinsman; and whom you loved a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat folly you are talking, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Beatrix, looking with her\r\ngreat eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis sober earnest,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond. And, indeed, the scheme had been\r\ndwelling a good deal in his mind for some time past, and especially\r\nsince his return home, when he found how hopeless, and even degrading\r\nto himself, his passion was. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, then: \xe2\x80\x9cI have tried half a\r\ndozen times now. I can bear being away from you well enough; but being\r\nwith you is intolerable\xe2\x80\x9d (another low curtsy on Mistress Beatrix's\r\npart), \xe2\x80\x9cand I will go. I have enough to buy axes and guns for my men,\r\nand beads and blankets for the savages; and I'll go and live amongst\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon ami,\xe2\x80\x9d she says quite kindly, and taking Esmond's hand, with an air\r\nof great compassion, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can't think that in our position anything more\r\nthan our present friendship is possible. You are our elder brother--as\r\nsuch we view you, pitying your misfortune, not rebuking you with it.\r\nWhy, you are old enough and grave enough to be our father. I always\r\nthought you a hundred years old, Harry, with your solemn face and grave\r\nair. I feel as a sister to you, and can no more. Isn't that enough,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d And she put her face quite close to his--who knows with what\r\nintention?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's too much,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, turning away. \xe2\x80\x9cI can't bear this life,\r\nand shall leave it. I shall stay, I think, to see you married, and then\r\nfreight a ship, and call it the 'Beatrix,' and bid you all . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the servant, flinging the door open, announced his Grace the Duke\r\nof Hamilton, and Esmond started back with something like an imprecation\r\non his lips, as the nobleman entered, looking splendid in his star and\r\ngreen ribbon. He gave Mr. Esmond just that gracious bow which he would\r\nhave given to a lackey who fetched him a chair or took his hat, and\r\nseated himself by Miss Beatrix, as the poor Colonel went out of the room\r\nwith a hang-dog look.\r\n\r\nEsmond's mistress was in the lower room as he passed down stairs. She\r\noften met him as he was coming away from Beatrix; and she beckoned him\r\ninto the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she told you, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Castlewood said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been very frank--very,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--but about what is going to happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is going to happen?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, his heart beating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Grace the Duke of Hamilton has proposed to her,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nmade his offer yesterday. They will marry as soon as his mourning is\r\nover; and you have heard his Grace is appointed Ambassador to Paris; and\r\nthe Ambassadress goes with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBEATRIX'S NEW SUITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gentleman whom Beatrix had selected was, to be sure, twenty years\r\nolder than the Colonel, with whom she quarrelled for being too old; but\r\nthis one was but a nameless adventurer, and the other the greatest duke\r\nin Scotland, with pretensions even to a still higher title. My Lord Duke\r\nof Hamilton had, indeed, every merit belonging to a gentleman, and he\r\nhad had the time to mature his accomplishments fully, being upwards of\r\nfifty years old when Madam Beatrix selected him for a bridegroom. Duke\r\nHamilton, then Earl of Arran, had been educated at the famous Scottish\r\nuniversity of Glasgow, and, coming to London, became a great favorite\r\nof Charles the Second, who made him a lord of his bedchamber, and\r\nafterwards appointed him ambassador to the French king, under whom the\r\nEarl served two campaigns as his Majesty's aide-de-camp; and he was\r\nabsent on this service when King Charles died.\r\n\r\nKing James continued my lord's promotion--made him Master of the\r\nWardrobe and Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse; and his lordship\r\nadhered firmly to King James, being of the small company that never\r\nquitted that unfortunate monarch till his departure out of England; and\r\nthen it was, in 1688 namely, that he made the friendship with Colonel\r\nFrancis Esmond, that had always been, more or less, maintained in the\r\ntwo families.\r\n\r\nThe Earl professed a great admiration for King William always, but never\r\ncould give him his allegiance; and was engaged in more than one of the\r\nplots in the late great King's reign which always ended in the plotters'\r\ndiscomfiture, and generally in their pardon, by the magnanimity of the\r\nKing. Lord Arran was twice prisoner in the Tower during this reign,\r\nundauntedly saying, when offered his release, upon parole not to engage\r\nagainst King William, that he would not give his word, because \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nwas sure he could not keep it;\xe2\x80\x9d but, nevertheless, he was both times\r\ndischarged without any trial; and the King bore this noble enemy so\r\nlittle malice, that when his mother, the Duchess of Hamilton, of her\r\nown right, resigned her claim on her husband's death, the Earl was,\r\nby patent signed at Loo, 1690, created Duke of Hamilton, Marquis\r\nof Clydesdale, and Earl of Arran, with precedency from the original\r\ncreation. His Grace took the oaths and his seat in the Scottish\r\nparliament in 1700: was famous there for his patriotism and eloquence,\r\nespecially in the debates about the Union Bill, which Duke Hamilton\r\nopposed with all his strength, though he would not go the length of the\r\nScottish gentry, who were for resisting it by force of arms. 'Twas\r\nsaid he withdrew his opposition all of a sudden, and in consequence\r\nof letters from the King at St. Germains, who entreated him on his\r\nallegiance not to thwart the Queen his sister in this measure; and the\r\nDuke, being always bent upon effecting the King's return to his kingdom\r\nthrough a reconciliation between his Majesty and Queen Anne, and quite\r\naverse to his landing with arms and French troops, held aloof, and\r\nkept out of Scotland during the time when the Chevalier de St. George's\r\ndescent from Dunkirk was projected, passing his time in England in his\r\ngreat estate in Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nWhen the Whigs went out of office in 1710, the Queen began to show\r\nhis Grace the very greatest marks of her favor. He was created Duke\r\nof Brandon and Baron of Dutton in England; having the Thistle already\r\noriginally bestowed on him by King James the Second, his Grace was\r\nnow promoted to the honor of the Garter--a distinction so great and\r\nillustrious, that no subject hath ever borne them hitherto together.\r\nWhen this objection was made to her Majesty, she was pleased to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a subject as the Duke of Hamilton has a pre-eminent claim to every\r\nmark of distinction which a crowned head can confer. I will henceforth\r\nwear both orders myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the Chapter held at Windsor in October, 1712, the Duke and other\r\nknights, including Lord-Treasurer, the new-created Earl of Oxford\r\nand Mortimer, were installed; and a few days afterwards his Grace was\r\nappointed Ambassador-Extraordinary to France, and his equipages, plate,\r\nand liveries commanded, of the most sumptuous kind, not only for his\r\nExcellency the Ambassador, but for her Excellency the Ambassadress,\r\nwho was to accompany him. Her arms were already quartered on the coach\r\npanels, and her brother was to hasten over on the appointed day to give\r\nher away.\r\n\r\nHis lordship was a widower, having married, in 1698, Elizabeth, daughter\r\nof Digby Lord Gerard, by which marriage great estates came into the\r\nHamilton family; and out of these estates came, in part, that tragic\r\nquarrel which ended the Duke's career.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the loss of a tooth to that of a mistress there's no pang that is\r\nnot bearable. The apprehension is much more cruel than the certainty;\r\nand we make up our mind to the misfortune when 'tis irremediable, part\r\nwith the tormentor, and mumble our crust on t'other side of the jaws.\r\nI think Colonel Esmond was relieved when a ducal coach and six came and\r\nwhisked his charmer away out of his reach, and placed her in a higher\r\nsphere. As you have seen the nymph in the opera-machine go up to the\r\nclouds at the end of the piece where Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, and all the\r\ndivine company of Olympians are seated, and quaver out her last song\r\nas a goddess: so when this portentous elevation was accomplished in\r\nthe Esmond family, I am not sure that every one of us did not treat the\r\ndivine Beatrix with special honors; at least the saucy little beauty\r\ncarried her head with a toss of supreme authority, and assumed a\r\ntouch-me-not air, which all her friends very good-humoredly bowed to.\r\n\r\nAn old army acquaintance of Colonel Esmond's, honest Tom Trett, who had\r\nsold his company, married a wife, and turned merchant in the city, was\r\ndreadfully gloomy for a long time, though living in a fine house on the\r\nriver, and carrying on a great trade to all appearance. At length Esmond\r\nsaw his friend's name in the Gazette as a bankrupt; and a week after\r\nthis circumstance my bankrupt walks into Mr. Esmond's lodging with a\r\nface perfectly radiant with good-humor, and as jolly and careless as\r\nwhen they had sailed from Southampton ten years before for Vigo. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nbankruptcy,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom, \xe2\x80\x9chas been hanging over my head these three\r\nyears; the thought hath prevented my sleeping, and I have looked at poor\r\nPolly's head on t'other pillow, and then towards my razor on the table,\r\nand thought to put an end to myself, and so give my woes the slip. But\r\nnow we are bankrupts: Tom Trett pays as many shillings in the pound as\r\nhe can; his wife has a little cottage at Fulham, and her fortune secured\r\nto herself. I am afraid neither of bailiff nor of creditor: and for the\r\nlast six nights have slept easy.\xe2\x80\x9d So it was that when Fortune shook her\r\nwings and left him, honest Tom cuddled himself up in his ragged virtue,\r\nand fell asleep.\r\n\r\nEsmond did not tell his friend how much his story applied to Esmond too;\r\nbut he laughed at it, and used it; and having fairly struck his docket\r\nin this love transaction, determined to put a cheerful face on his\r\nbankruptcy. Perhaps Beatrix was a little offended at his gayety.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the way, sir, that you receive the announcement of your\r\nmisfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cand do you come smiling before me as if you were\r\nglad to be rid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond would not be put off from his good-humor, but told her the story\r\nof Tom Trett and his bankruptcy. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been hankering after the grapes\r\non the wall,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cand lost my temper because they were beyond my\r\nreach; was there any wonder? They're gone now, and another has them--a\r\ntaller man than your humble servant has won them.\xe2\x80\x9d And the Colonel made\r\nhis cousin a low bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA taller man, Cousin Esmond!\xe2\x80\x9d says she. \xe2\x80\x9cA man of spirit would have\r\nsealed the wall, sir, and seized them! A man of courage would have\r\nfought for 'em, not gaped for 'em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Duke has but to gape and they drop into his mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, with\r\nanother low bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9ca Duke IS a taller man than you. And why should I\r\nnot be grateful to one such as his Grace, who gives me his heart and his\r\ngreat name? It is a great gift he honors me with; I know 'tis a bargain\r\nbetween us; and I accept it, and will do my utmost to perform my part of\r\nit. 'Tis no question of sighing and philandering between a noble man\r\nof his Grace's age and a girl who hath little of that softness in her\r\nnature. Why should I not own that I am ambitious, Harry Esmond; and if\r\nit be no sin in a man to covet honor, why should a woman too not desire\r\nit? Shall I be frank with you, Harry, and say that if you had not been\r\ndown on your knees, and so humble, you might have fared better with\r\nme? A woman of my spirit, cousin, is to be won by gallantry, and not\r\nby sighs and rueful faces. All the time you are worshipping and singing\r\nhymns to me, I know very well I am no goddess, and grow weary of the\r\nincense. So would you have been weary of the goddess too--when she was\r\ncalled Mrs. Esmond, and got out of humor because she had not pin-money\r\nenough, and was forced to go about in an old gown. Eh! cousin, a\r\ngoddess in a mob-cap, that has to make her husband's gruel, ceases to\r\nbe divine--I am sure of it. I should have been sulky and scolded; and of\r\nall the proud wretches in the world Mr. Esmond is the proudest, let me\r\ntell him that. You never fall into a passion; but you never forgive, I\r\nthink. Had you been a great man, you might have been good-humored; but\r\nbeing nobody, sir, you are too great a man for me; and I'm afraid of\r\nyou, cousin--there! and I won't worship you, and you'll never be happy\r\nexcept with a woman who will. Why, after I belonged to you, and after\r\none of my tantrums, you would have put the pillow over my head some\r\nnight, and smothered me, as the black man does the woman in the play\r\nthat you're so fond of. What's the creature's name?--Desdemona. You\r\nwould, you little black-dyed Othello!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should, Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I want no such ending. I intend to live to be a hundred, and to\r\ngo to ten thousand routs and balls, and to play cards every night of my\r\nlife till the year eighteen hundred. And I like to be the first of my\r\ncompany, sir; and I like flattery and compliments, and you give me none;\r\nand I like to be made to laugh, sir, and who's to laugh at YOUR\r\ndismal face, I should like to know? and I like a coach-and six or a\r\ncoach-and-eight; and I like diamonds, and a new gown every week; and\r\npeople to say--'That's the Duchess--How well her Grace looks--Make\r\nway for Madame l'Ambassadrice d'Angleterre--Call her Excellency's\r\npeople'--that's what I like. And as for you, you want a woman to bring\r\nyour slippers and cap, and to sit at your feet, and cry, 'O caro! O\r\nbravo!' whilst you read your Shakespeares and Miltons and stuff. Mamma\r\nwould have been the wife for you, had you been a little older, though\r\nyou look ten years older than she does--you do, you glum-faced,\r\nblue-bearded little old man! You might have sat, like Darby and Joan,\r\nand flattered each other; and billed and cooed like a pair of old\r\npigeons on a perch. I want my wings and to use them, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\nspread out her beautiful arms, as if indeed she could fly off like the\r\npretty \xe2\x80\x9cGawrie,\xe2\x80\x9d whom the man in the story was enamored of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will your Peter Wilkins say to your flight?\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, who\r\nnever admired this fair creature more than when she rebelled and laughed\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA duchess knows her place,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have a\r\nson already made for me, and thirty years old (my Lord Arran), and four\r\ndaughters. How they will scold, and what a rage they will be in, when I\r\ncome to take the head of the table! But I give them only a month to\r\nbe angry; at the end of that time they shall love me every one, and\r\nso shall Lord Arran, and so shall all his Grace's Scots vassals and\r\nfollowers in the Highlands. I'm bent on it; and when I take a thing in\r\nmy head, 'tis done. His Grace is the greatest gentleman in Europe, and\r\nI'll try and make him happy; and, when the King comes back, you may\r\ncount on my protection, Cousin Esmond--for come back the King will and\r\nshall; and I'll bring him back from Versailles, if he comes under my\r\nhoop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the world will make you happy, Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, with a\r\nsigh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou'll be Beatrix till you are my Lady Duchess--will you not? I\r\nshall then make your Grace my very lowest bow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of these sighs and this satire, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI take his\r\nGrace's great bounty thankfully--yes, thankfully; and will wear his\r\nhonors becomingly. I do not say he hath touched my heart; but he has my\r\ngratitude, obedience, admiration--I have told him that, and no more;\r\nand with that his noble heart is content. I have told him all--even the\r\nstory of that poor creature that I was engaged to--and that I could not\r\nlove; and I gladly gave his word back to him, and jumped for joy to get\r\nback my own. I am twenty-five years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-six, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five, sir--I choose to be twenty-five; and in eight years no man\r\nhath ever touched my heart. Yes--you did once, for a little, Harry, when\r\nyou came back after Lille, and engaging with that murderer Mohun, and\r\nsaving Frank's life. I thought I could like you; and mamma begged me\r\nhard, on her knees, and I did--for a day. But the old chill came over\r\nme, Henry, and the old fear of you and your melancholy; and I was glad\r\nwhen you went away, and engaged with my Lord Ashburnham, that I might\r\nhear no more of you, that's the truth. You are too good for me, somehow.\r\nI could not make you happy, and should break my heart in trying, and\r\nnot being able to love you. But if you had asked me when we gave you\r\nthe sword, you might have had me, sir, and we both should have been\r\nmiserable by this time. I talked with that silly lord all night just to\r\nvex you and mamma, and I succeeded, didn't I? How frankly we can talk\r\nof these things! It seems a thousand years ago: and, though we are here\r\nsitting in the same room, there is a great wall between us. My dear,\r\nkind, faithful, gloomy old cousin! I can like now, and admire you too,\r\nsir, and say that you are brave, and very kind, and very true, and a\r\nfine gentleman for all--for all your little mishap at your birth,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nshe, wagging her arch head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, with a curtsy, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must have no more talk\r\nexcept when mamma is by, as his Grace is with us; for he does not half\r\nlike you, cousin, and is jealous as the black man in your favorite\r\nplay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough the very kindness of the words stabbed Mr. Esmond with the\r\nkeenest pang, he did not show his sense of the wound by any look of his\r\n(as Beatrix, indeed, afterwards owned to him), but said, with a perfect\r\ncommand of himself and an easy smile, \xe2\x80\x9cThe interview must not end yet,\r\nmy dear, until I have had my last word. Stay, here comes your mother\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (indeed she came in here with her sweet anxious face, and Esmond going\r\nup kissed her hand respectfully). \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady may hear, too, the\r\nlast words, which are no secrets, and are only a parting benediction\r\naccompanying a present for your marriage from an old gentleman your\r\nguardian; for I feel as if I was the guardian of all the family, and an\r\nold old fellow that is fit to be the grandfather of you all; and in this\r\ncharacter let me make my Lady Duchess her wedding present. They are the\r\ndiamonds my father's widow left me. I had thought Beatrix might have\r\nhad them a year ago; but they are good enough for a duchess, though not\r\nbright enough for the handsomest woman in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d And he took the\r\ncase out of his pocket in which the jewels were, and presented them to\r\nhis cousin.\r\n\r\nShe gave a cry of delight, for the stones were indeed very handsome,\r\nand of great value; and the next minute the necklace was where Belinda's\r\ncross is in Mr. Pope's admirable poem, and glittering on the whitest and\r\nmost perfectly-shaped neck in all England.\r\n\r\nThe girl's delight at receiving these trinkets was so great, that after\r\nrushing to the looking-glass and examining the effect they produced upon\r\nthat fair neck which they surrounded, Beatrix was running back with her\r\narms extended, and was perhaps for paying her cousin with a price, that\r\nhe would have liked no doubt to receive from those beautiful rosy\r\nlips of hers, but at this moment the door opened, and his Grace the\r\nbridegroom elect was announced.\r\n\r\nHe looked very black upon Mr. Esmond, to whom he made a very low bow\r\nindeed, and kissed the hand of each lady in his most ceremonious manner.\r\nHe had come in his chair from the palace hard by, and wore his two stars\r\nof the Garter and the Thistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, my Lord Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mistress Beatrix, advancing to him, and\r\nshowing the diamonds on her breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiamonds,\xe2\x80\x9d says his Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cHm! they seem pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a present on my marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom her Majesty?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Queen is very good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my cousin Henry--from our cousin Henry\xe2\x80\x9d--cry both the ladies in a\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not the honor of knowing the gentleman. I thought that my Lord\r\nCastlewood had no brother: and that on your ladyship's side there were\r\nno nephews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom our cousin, Colonel Henry Esmond, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, taking\r\nthe Colonel's hand very bravely,--\xe2\x80\x9cwho was left guardian to us by our\r\nfather, and who has a hundred times shown his love and friendship for\r\nour family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duchess of Hamilton receives no diamonds but from her husband,\r\nmadam,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Duke--\xe2\x80\x9cmay I pray you to restore these to Mr. Esmond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeatrix Esmond may receive a present from our kinsman and benefactor,\r\nmy Lord Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lady Castlewood, with an air of great dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nis my daughter yet: and if her mother sanctions the gift--no one else\r\nhath the right to question it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKinsman and benefactor!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cI know of no kinsman: and I do\r\nnot choose that my wife should have for benefactor a--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord!\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not here to bandy words,\xe2\x80\x9d says his Grace: \xe2\x80\x9cfrankly I tell you\r\nthat your visits to this house are too frequent, and that I choose no\r\npresents for the Duchess of Hamilton from gentlemen that bear a name\r\nthey have no right to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord!\xe2\x80\x9d breaks out Lady Castlewood, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Esmond hath the best right\r\nto that name of any man in the world: and 'tis as old and as honorable\r\nas your Grace's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy Lord Duke smiled, and looked as if Lady Castlewood was mad, that was\r\nso talking to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I called him benefactor,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mistress, \xe2\x80\x9cit is because he has\r\nbeen so to us--yes, the noblest, the truest, the bravest, the dearest of\r\nbenefactors. He would have saved my husband's life from Mohun's sword.\r\nHe did save my boy's, and defended him from that villain. Are those no\r\nbenefits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask Colonel Esmond's pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d says his Grace, if possible more\r\nhaughty than before. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say not a word that should give him\r\noffence, and thank him for his kindness to your ladyship's family. My\r\nLord Mohun and I are connected, you know, by marriage--though neither\r\nby blood nor friendship; but I must repeat what I said, that my wife can\r\nreceive no presents from Colonel Esmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter may receive presents from the Head of our House: my\r\ndaughter may thankfully take kindness from her father's, her mother's,\r\nher brother's dearest friend; and be grateful for one more benefit\r\nbesides the thousand we owe him,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Lady Esmond. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a string\r\nof diamond stones compared to that affection he hath given us--our\r\ndearest preserver and benefactor? We owe him not only Frank's life, but\r\nour all--yes, our all,\xe2\x80\x9d says my mistress, with a heightened color and a\r\ntrembling voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe title we bear is his, if he would claim it. 'Tis\r\nwe who have no right to our name: not he that's too great for it. He\r\nsacrificed his name at my dying lord's bedside--sacrificed it to my\r\norphan children; gave up rank and honor because he loved us so nobly.\r\nHis father was Viscount of Castlewood and Marquis of Esmond before\r\nhim; and he is his father's lawful son and true heir, and we are the\r\nrecipients of his bounty, and he the chief of a house that's as old as\r\nyour own. And if he is content to forego his name that my child may\r\nbear it, we love him and honor him and bless him under whatever name he\r\nbears\xe2\x80\x9d--and here the fond and affectionate creature would have knelt to\r\nEsmond again, but that he prevented her; and Beatrix, running up to her\r\nwith a pale face and a cry of alarm, embraced her and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother,\r\nwhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis a family secret, my Lord Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel Esmond: \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Beatrix\r\nknew nothing of it; nor did my lady till a year ago. And I have as good\r\na right to resign my title as your Grace's mother to abdicate hers to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have told everything to the Duke of Hamilton,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\nmistress, \xe2\x80\x9chad his Grace applied to me for my daughter's hand, and not\r\nto Beatrix. I should have spoken with you this very day in private, my\r\nlord, had not your words brought about this sudden explanation--and now\r\n'tis fit Beatrix should hear it; and know, as I would have all the world\r\nknow, what we owe to our kinsman and patron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then in her touching way, and having hold of her daughter's hand,\r\nand speaking to her rather than my Lord Duke, Lady Castlewood told the\r\nstory which you know already--lauding up to the skies her kinsman's\r\nbehavior. On his side Mr. Esmond explained the reasons that seemed quite\r\nsufficiently cogent with him, why the succession in the family, as at\r\npresent it stood, should not be disturbed; and he should remain as he\r\nwas, Colonel Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Marquis of Esmond, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says his Grace, with a low bow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to ask your lordship's pardon for words that were uttered in\r\nignorance; and to beg for the favor of your friendship. To be allied to\r\nyou, sir, must be an honor under whatever name you are known\xe2\x80\x9d (so his\r\nGrace was pleased to say); \xe2\x80\x9cand in return for the splendid present you\r\nmake my wife, your kinswoman, I hope you will please to command any\r\nservice that James Douglas can perform. I shall never be easy until I\r\nrepay you a part of my obligations at least; and ere very long, and with\r\nthe mission her Majesty hath given me,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cthat may perhaps\r\nbe in my power. I shall esteem it as a favor, my lord, if Colonel Esmond\r\nwill give away the bride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he will take the usual payment in advance, he is welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nBeatrix, stepping up to him; and, as Esmond kissed her, she whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why didn't I know you before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy Lord Duke was as hot as a flame at this salute, but said never a\r\nword: Beatrix made him a proud curtsy, and the two ladies quitted the\r\nroom together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen does your Excellency go for Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Colonel Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon after the ceremony as may be,\xe2\x80\x9d his Grace answered. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis fixed\r\nfor the first of December: it cannot be sooner. The equipage will not be\r\nready till then. The Queen intends the embassy should be very grand--and\r\nI have law business to settle. That ill-omened Mohun has come, or is\r\ncoming, to London again: we are in a lawsuit about my late Lord Gerard's\r\nproperty; and he hath sent to me to meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMOHUN APPEARS FOR THE LAST TIME IN THIS HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides my Lord Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, who for family reasons had\r\nkindly promised his protection and patronage to Colonel Esmond, he had\r\nother great friends in power now, both able and willing to assist him,\r\nand he might, with such allies, look forward to as fortunate advancement\r\nin civil life at home as he had got rapid promotion abroad. His Grace\r\nwas magnanimous enough to offer to take Mr. Esmond as secretary on\r\nhis Paris embassy, but no doubt he intended that proposal should be\r\nrejected; at any rate, Esmond could not bear the thoughts of attending\r\nhis mistress farther than the church-door after her marriage, and so\r\ndeclined that offer which his generous rival made him.\r\n\r\nOther gentlemen in power were liberal at least of compliments and\r\npromises to Colonel Esmond. Mr. Harley, now become my Lord Oxford and\r\nMortimer, and installed Knight of the Garter on the same day as his\r\nGrace of Hamilton had received the same honor, sent to the Colonel to\r\nsay that a seat in Parliament should be at his disposal presently,\r\nand Mr. St. John held out many flattering hopes of advancement to\r\nthe Colonel when he should enter the House. Esmond's friends were all\r\nsuccessful, and the most successful and triumphant of all was his dear\r\nold commander, General Webb, who was now appointed Lieutenant-General of\r\nthe Land Forces, and received with particular honor by the Ministry, by\r\nthe Queen, and the people out of doors, who huzza'd the brave chief\r\nwhen they used to see him in his chariot going to the House or to the\r\nDrawing-room, or hobbling on foot to his coach from St. Stephen's upon\r\nhis glorious old crutch and stick, and cheered him as loud as they had\r\never done Marlborough.\r\n\r\nThat great Duke was utterly disgraced; and honest old Webb dated all\r\nhis Grace's misfortunes from Wynendael, and vowed that Fate served the\r\ntraitor right. Duchess Sarah had also gone to ruin; she had been forced\r\nto give up her keys, and her places, and her pensions:--\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nWebb, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would have locked up three millions of French crowns with her\r\nkeys had I but been knocked on the head, but I stopped that convoy at\r\nWynendael.\xe2\x80\x9d Our enemy Cardonnel was turned out of the House of Commons\r\n(along with Mr. Walpole) for malversation of public money. Cadogan lost\r\nhis place of Lieutenant of the Tower. Marlborough's daughters resigned\r\ntheir posts of ladies of the bedchamber; and so complete was the Duke's\r\ndisgrace, that his son-in-law, Lord Bridgewater, was absolutely obliged\r\nto give up his lodgings at St. James's, and had his half-pension,\r\nas Master of the Horse, taken away. But I think the lowest depth of\r\nMarlborough's fall was when he humbly sent to ask General Webb when he\r\nmight wait upon him; he who had commanded the stout old General, who\r\nhad injured him and sneered at him, who had kept him dangling in his\r\nante-chamber, who could not even after his great service condescend to\r\nwrite him a letter in his own hand. The nation was as eager for peace as\r\never it had been hot for war. The Prince of Savoy came amongst us, had\r\nhis audience of the Queen, and got his famous Sword of Honor, and strove\r\nwith all his force to form a Whig party together, to bring over the\r\nyoung Prince of Hanover to do anything which might prolong the war, and\r\nconsummate the ruin of the old sovereign whom he hated so implacably.\r\nBut the nation was tired of the struggle: so completely wearied of it\r\nthat not even our defeat at Denain could rouse us into any anger, though\r\nsuch an action so lost two years before would have set all England in\r\na fury. 'Twas easy to see that the great Marlborough was not with the\r\narmy. Eugene was obliged to fall back in a rage, and forego the dazzling\r\nrevenge of his life. 'Twas in vain the Duke's side asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWould we\r\nsuffer our arms to be insulted? Would we not send back the only\r\nchampion who could repair our honor?\xe2\x80\x9d The nation had had its bellyful of\r\nfighting; nor could taunts or outcries goad up our Britons any more.\r\n\r\nFor a statesman that was always prating of liberty, and had the grandest\r\nphilosophic maxims in his mouth, it must be owned that Mr. St. John\r\nsometimes rather acted like a Turkish than a Greek philosopher, and\r\nespecially fell foul of one unfortunate set of men, the men of letters,\r\nwith a tyranny a little extraordinary in a man who professed to respect\r\ntheir calling so much. The literary controversy at this time was very\r\nbitter, the Government side was the winning one, the popular one, and\r\nI think might have been the merciful one. 'Twas natural that the\r\nopposition should be peevish and cry out: some men did so from their\r\nhearts, admiring the Duke of Marlborough's prodigious talents, and\r\ndeploring the disgrace of the greatest general the world ever knew:\r\n'twas the stomach that caused other patriots to grumble, and such men\r\ncried out because they were poor, and paid to do so. Against these my\r\nLord Bolingbroke never showed the slightest mercy, whipping a dozen into\r\nprison or into the pillory without the least commiseration.\r\n\r\nFrom having been a man of arms Mr. Esmond had now come to be a man of\r\nletters, but on a safer side than that in which the above-cited poor\r\nfellows ventured their liberties and ears. There was no danger on ours,\r\nwhich was the winning side; besides, Mr. Esmond pleased himself by\r\nthinking that he writ like a gentleman if he did not always succeed as a\r\nwit.\r\n\r\nOf the famous wits of that age, who have rendered Queen Anne's reign\r\nillustrious, and whose works will be in all Englishmen's hands in ages\r\nyet to come, Mr. Esmond saw many, but at public places chiefly; never\r\nhaving a great intimacy with any of them, except with honest Dick Steele\r\nand Mr. Addison, who parted company with Esmond, however, when that\r\ngentleman became a declared Tory, and lived on close terms with the\r\nleading persons of that party. Addison kept himself to a few friends,\r\nand very rarely opened himself except in their company. A man more\r\nupright and conscientious than he it was not possible to find in public\r\nlife, and one whose conversation was so various, easy, and delightful.\r\nWriting now in my mature years, I own that I think Addison's politics\r\nwere the right, and were my time to come over again, I would be a Whig\r\nin England and not a Tory; but with people that take a side in politics,\r\n'tis men rather than principles that commonly bind them. A kindness or a\r\nslight puts a man under one flag or the other, and he marches with it\r\nto the end of the campaign. Esmond's master in war was injured by\r\nMarlborough, and hated him: and the lieutenant fought the quarrels of\r\nhis leader. Webb coming to London was used as a weapon by Marlborough's\r\nenemies (and true steel he was, that honest chief); nor was his\r\naide-de-camp, Mr. Esmond, an unfaithful or unworthy partisan. 'Tis\r\nstrange here, and on a foreign soil, and in a land that is independent\r\nin all but the name, (for that the North American colonies shall remain\r\ndependants on yonder little island for twenty years more, I never can\r\nthink,) to remember how the nation at home seemed to give itself up to\r\nthe domination of one or other aristocratic party, and took a Hanoverian\r\nking, or a French one, according as either prevailed. And while the\r\nTories, the October club gentlemen, the High Church parsons that held by\r\nthe Church of England, were for having a Papist king, for whom many of\r\ntheir Scottish and English leaders, firm churchmen all, laid down their\r\nlives with admirable loyalty and devotion; they were governed by men who\r\nhad notoriously no religion at all, but used it as they would use any\r\nopinion for the purpose of forwarding their own ambition. The Whigs, on\r\nthe other hand, who professed attachment to religion and liberty too,\r\nwere compelled to send to Holland or Hanover for a monarch around\r\nwhom they could rally. A strange series of compromises is that English\r\nHistory; compromise of principle, compromise of party, compromise of\r\nworship! The lovers of English freedom and independence submitted their\r\nreligious consciences to an Act of Parliament; could not consolidate\r\ntheir liberty without sending to Zell or the Hague for a king to live\r\nunder; and could not find amongst the proudest people in the world a\r\nman speaking their own language, and understanding their laws, to govern\r\nthem. The Tory and High Church patriots were ready to die in defence of\r\na Papist family that had sold us to France; the great Whig nobles, the\r\nsturdy republican recusants who had cut off Charles Stuart's head for\r\ntreason, were fain to accept a king whose title came to him through a\r\nroyal grandmother, whose own royal grandmother's head had fallen under\r\nQueen Bess's hatchet. And our proud English nobles sent to a petty\r\nGerman town for a monarch to come and reign in London and our prelates\r\nkissed the ugly hands of his Dutch mistresses, and thought it no\r\ndishonor. In England you can but belong to one party or t'other, and you\r\ntake the house you live in with all its encumbrances, its retainers, its\r\nantique discomforts, and ruins even; you patch up, but you never build\r\nup anew. Will we of the new world submit much longer, even nominally,\r\nto this ancient British superstition? There are signs of the times which\r\nmake me think that ere long we shall care as little about King George\r\nhere, and peers temporal and peers spiritual, as we do for King Canute\r\nor the Druids.\r\n\r\nThis chapter began about the wits, my grandson may say, and hath\r\nwandered very far from their company. The pleasantest of the wits I\r\nknew were the Doctors Garth and Arbuthnot, and Mr. Gay, the author of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrivia,\xe2\x80\x9d the most charming kind soul that ever laughed at a joke or\r\ncracked a bottle. Mr. Prior I saw, and he was the earthen pot swimming\r\nwith the pots of brass down the stream, and always and justly frightened\r\nlest he should break in the voyage. I met him both at London and Paris,\r\nwhere he was performing piteous congees to the Duke of Shrewsbury, not\r\nhaving courage to support the dignity which his undeniable genius and\r\ntalent had won him, and writing coaxing letters to Secretary St. John,\r\nand thinking about his plate and his place, and what on earth should\r\nbecome of him should his party go out. The famous Mr. Congreve I saw\r\na dozen of times at Button's, a splendid wreck of a man, magnificently\r\nattired, and though gouty, and almost blind, bearing a brave face\r\nagainst fortune.\r\n\r\nThe great Mr. Pope (of whose prodigious genius I have no words to\r\nexpress my admiration) was quite a puny lad at this time, appearing\r\nseldom in public places. There were hundreds of men, wits, and pretty\r\nfellows frequenting the theatres and coffee-houses of that day--whom\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnunc perscribere longum est.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed I think the most brilliant of that\r\nsort I ever saw was not till fifteen years afterwards, when I paid my\r\nlast visit in England, and met young Harry Fielding, son of the Fielding\r\nthat served in Spain and afterwards in Flanders with us, and who for fun\r\nand humor seemed to top them all. As for the famous Dr. Swift, I can say\r\nof him, \xe2\x80\x9cVidi tantum.\xe2\x80\x9d He was in London all these years up to the death\r\nof the Queen; and in a hundred public places where I saw him, but no\r\nmore; he never missed Court of a Sunday, where once or twice he was\r\npointed out to your grandfather. He would have sought me out eagerly\r\nenough had I been a great man with a title to my name, or a star on my\r\ncoat. At Court the Doctor had no eyes but for the very greatest. Lord\r\nTreasurer and St. John used to call him Jonathan, and they paid him\r\nwith this cheap coin for the service they took of him. He writ their\r\nlampoons, fought their enemies, flogged and bullied in their service,\r\nand it must be owned with a consummate skill and fierceness. 'Tis said\r\nhe hath lost his intellect now, and forgotten his wrongs and his rage\r\nagainst mankind. I have always thought of him and of Marlborough as the\r\ntwo greatest men of that age. I have read his books (who doth not know\r\nthem?) here in our calm woods, and imagine a giant to myself as I think\r\nof him, a lonely fallen Prometheus, groaning as the vulture tears him.\r\nPrometheus I saw, but when first I ever had any words with him, the\r\ngiant stepped out of a sedan chair in the Poultry, whither he had come\r\nwith a tipsy Irish servant parading before him, who announced him,\r\nbawling out his Reverence's name, whilst his master below was as yet\r\nhaggling with the chairman. I disliked this Mr. Swift, and heard many a\r\nstory about him, of his conduct to men, and his words to women. He could\r\nflatter the great as much as he could bully the weak; and Mr. Esmond,\r\nbeing younger and hotter in that day than now, was determined, should he\r\never meet this dragon, not to run away from his teeth and his fire.\r\n\r\nMen have all sorts of motives which carry them onwards in life, and are\r\ndriven into acts of desperation, or it may be of distinction, from a\r\nhundred different causes. There was one comrade of Esmond's, an honest\r\nlittle Irish lieutenant of Handyside's, who owed so much money to a camp\r\nsutler, that he began to make love to the man's daughter, intending to\r\npay his debt that way; and at the battle of Malplaquet, flying away from\r\nthe debt and lady too, he rushed so desperately on the French lines,\r\nthat he got his company; and came a captain out of the action, and had\r\nto marry the sutler's daughter after all, who brought him his cancelled\r\ndebt to her father as poor Roger's fortune. To run out of the reach of\r\nbill and marriage, he ran on the enemy's pikes; and as these did not\r\nkill him he was thrown back upon t'other horn of his dilemma. Our great\r\nDuke at the same battle was fighting, not the French, but the Tories in\r\nEngland; and risking his life and the army's, not for his country but\r\nfor his pay and places; and for fear of his wife at home, that only\r\nbeing in life whom he dreaded. I have asked about men in my own company,\r\n(new drafts of poor country boys were perpetually coming over to us\r\nduring the wars, and brought from the ploughshare to the sword,) and\r\nfound that a half of them under the flags were driven thither on account\r\nof a woman: one fellow was jilted by his mistress and took the shilling\r\nin despair; another jilted the girl, and fled from her and the parish\r\nto the tents where the law could not disturb him. Why go on\r\nparticularizing? What can the sons of Adam and Eve expect, but to\r\ncontinue in that course of love and trouble their father and mother set\r\nout on? Oh, my grandson! I am drawing nigh to the end of that period of\r\nmy history, when I was acquainted with the great world of England and\r\nEurope; my years are past the Hebrew poet's limit, and I say unto thee,\r\nall my troubles and joys too, for that matter, have come from a woman;\r\nas thine will when thy destined course begins. 'Twas a woman that made a\r\nsoldier of me, that set me intriguing afterwards; I believe I would have\r\nspun smocks for her had she so bidden me; what strength I had in my head\r\nI would have given her; hath not every man in his degree had his Omphale\r\nand Delilah? Mine befooled me on the banks of the Thames, and in dear\r\nold England; thou mayest find thine own by Rappahannock.\r\n\r\nTo please that woman then I tried to distinguish myself as a soldier,\r\nand afterwards as a wit and a politician; as to please another I would\r\nhave put on a black cassock and a pair of bands, and had done so but\r\nthat a superior fate intervened to defeat that project. And I say, I\r\nthink the world is like Captain Esmond's company I spoke of anon;\r\nand could you see every man's career in life, you would find a woman\r\nclogging him; or clinging round his march and stopping him; or cheering\r\nhim and goading him: or beckoning him out of her chariot, so that he\r\ngoes up to her, and leaves the race to be run without him or bringing\r\nhim the apple, and saying \xe2\x80\x9cEat;\xe2\x80\x9d or fetching him the daggers and\r\nwhispering \xe2\x80\x9cKill! yonder lies Duncan, and a crown, and an opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYour grandfather fought with more effect as a politician than as a\r\nwit: and having private animosities and grievances of his own and\r\nhis General's against the great Duke in command of the army, and more\r\ninformation on military matters than most writers, who had never seen\r\nbeyond the fire of a tobacco-pipe at \xe2\x80\x9cWills's,\xe2\x80\x9d he was enabled to do\r\ngood service for that cause which he embarked in, and for Mr. St. John\r\nand his party. But he disdained the abuse in which some of the Tory\r\nwriters indulged; for instance, Dr. Swift, who actually chose to doubt\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough's courage, and was pleased to hint that his\r\nGrace's military capacity was doubtful: nor were Esmond's performances\r\nworse for the effect they were intended to produce, (though no doubt\r\nthey could not injure the Duke of Marlborough nearly so much in the\r\npublic eyes as the malignant attacks of Swift did, which were carefully\r\ndirected so as to blacken and degrade him,) because they were writ\r\nopenly and fairly by Mr. Esmond, who made no disguise of them, who was\r\nnow out of the army, and who never attacked the prodigious courage and\r\ntalents, only the selfishness and rapacity, of the chief.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel then, having writ a paper for one of the Tory journals,\r\ncalled the Post-Boy, (a letter upon Bouchain, that the town talked about\r\nfor two whole days, when the appearance of an Italian singer supplied\r\na fresh subject for conversation,) and having business at the Exchange,\r\nwhere Mistress Beatrix wanted a pair of gloves or a fan very likely,\r\nEsmond went to correct his paper, and was sitting at the printer's, when\r\nthe famous Doctor Swift came in, his Irish fellow with him that used\r\nto walk before his chair, and bawled out his master's name with great\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond was waiting for the printer too, whose wife had gone to the\r\ntavern to fetch him, and was meantime engaged in drawing a picture of\r\na soldier on horseback for a dirty little pretty boy of the printer's\r\nwife, whom she had left behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume you are the editor of the Post-Boy, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Doctor,\r\nin a grating voice that had an Irish twang; and he looked at the Colonel\r\nfrom under his two bushy eyebrows with a pair of very clear blue eyes.\r\nHis complexion was muddy, his figure rather fat, his chin double. He\r\nwore a shabby cassock, and a shabby hat over his black wig, and he\r\npulled out a great gold watch, at which he looks very fierce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am but a contributor, Doctor Swift,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, with the little boy\r\nstill on his knee. He was sitting with his back in the window, so that\r\nthe Doctor could not see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you I was Dr. Swift?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Doctor, eying the other very\r\nhaughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Reverence's valet bawled out your name,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould judge you brought him from Ireland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, sir, what right have you to judge whether my servant came\r\nfrom Ireland or no? I want to speak with your employer, Mr. Leach. I'll\r\nthank ye go fetch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere's your papa, Tommy?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the Colonel of the child, a smutty\r\nlittle wretch in a frock.\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, the child begins to cry; the Doctor's appearance\r\nhad no doubt frightened the poor little imp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend that squalling little brat about his business, and do what I bid\r\nye, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must finish, the picture first for Tommy,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel,\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Tommy, will you have your Pandour with whiskers or\r\nwithout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhisters,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tommy, quite intent on the picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil are ye, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x9care ye a printer's man\r\nor are ye not?\xe2\x80\x9d he pronounced it like NAUGHT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour reverence needn't raise the devil to ask who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel\r\nEsmond. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear of Doctor Faustus, little Tommy? or Friar\r\nBacon, who invented gunpowder, and set the Thames on fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Swift turned quite red, almost purple. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not intend any\r\noffence, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say, sir, you offended without meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are ye, sir? Do you know who I am, sir? You are one of the pack\r\nof Grub Street scribblers that my friend Mr. Secretary hath laid by the\r\nheels. How dare ye, sir, speak to me in this tone?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Doctor, in\r\na great fume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your honor's humble pardon if I have offended your honor,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nEsmond in a tone of great humility. \xe2\x80\x9cRather than be sent to the Compter,\r\nor be put in the pillory, there's nothing I wouldn't do. But Mrs.\r\nLeach, the printer's lady, told me to mind Tommy whilst she went for her\r\nhusband to the tavern, and I daren't leave the child lest he should fall\r\ninto the fire; but if your Reverence will hold him--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take the little beast!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Doctor, starting back. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nengaged to your betters, fellow. Tell Mr. Leach that when he makes an\r\nappointment with Dr. Swift he had best keep it, do ye hear? And keep a\r\nrespectful tongue in your head, sir, when you address a person like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm but a poor broken-down soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cand I've seen\r\nbetter days, though I am forced now to turn my hand to writing. We can't\r\nhelp our fate, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're the person that Mr. Leach hath spoken to me of, I presume. Have\r\nthe goodness to speak civilly when you are spoken to--and tell Leach\r\nto call at my lodgings in Bury Street, and bring the papers with him\r\nto-night at ten o'clock. And the next time you see me, you'll know me,\r\nand be civil, Mr. Kemp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Kemp, who had been a lieutenant at the beginning of the war, and\r\nfallen into misfortune, was the writer of the Post-Boy, and now took\r\nhonest Mr. Leach's pay in place of her Majesty's. Esmond had seen this\r\ngentleman, and a very ingenious, hardworking honest fellow he was,\r\ntoiling to give bread to a great family, and watching up many a long\r\nwinter night to keep the wolf from his door. And Mr. St. John, who had\r\nliberty always on his tongue, had just sent a dozen of the opposition\r\nwriters into prison, and one actually into the pillory, for what he\r\ncalled libels, but libels not half so violent as those writ on our\r\nside. With regard to this very piece of tyranny, Esmond had remonstrated\r\nstrongly with the Secretary, who laughed and said the rascals were\r\nserved quite right; and told Esmond a joke of Swift's regarding the\r\nmatter. Nay, more, this Irishman, when St. John was about to pardon\r\na poor wretch condemned to death for rape, absolutely prevented the\r\nSecretary from exercising this act of good-nature, and boasted that he\r\nhad had the man hanged; and great as the Doctor's genius might be, and\r\nsplendid his ability, Esmond for one would affect no love for him, and\r\nnever desired to make his acquaintance. The Doctor was at Court every\r\nSunday assiduously enough, a place the Colonel frequented but rarely,\r\nthough he had a great inducement to go there in the person of a fair\r\nmaid of honor of her Majesty's; and the airs and patronage Mr.\r\nSwift gave himself, forgetting gentlemen of his country whom he knew\r\nperfectly, his loud talk at once insolent and servile, nay, perhaps his\r\nvery intimacy with Lord Treasurer and the Secretary, who indulged all\r\nhis freaks and called him Jonathan, you may be sure, were remarked by\r\nmany a person of whom the proud priest himself took no note, during that\r\ntime of his vanity and triumph.\r\n\r\n'Twas but three days after the 15th of November, 1712 (Esmond minds him\r\nwell of the date), that he went by invitation to dine with his General,\r\nthe foot of whose table he used to take on these festive occasions, as\r\nhe had done at many a board, hard and plentiful, during the campaign.\r\nThis was a great feast, and of the latter sort; the honest old gentleman\r\nloved to treat his friends splendidly: his Grace of Ormonde, before he\r\njoined his army as generalissimo, my Lord Viscount Bolingbroke, one of\r\nher Majesty's Secretaries of State, my Lord Orkney, that had served\r\nwith us abroad, being of the party. His Grace of Hamilton, Master of\r\nthe Ordnance, and in whose honor the feast had been given, upon his\r\napproaching departure as Ambassador to Paris, had sent an excuse to\r\nGeneral Webb at two o'clock, but an hour before the dinner: nothing but\r\nthe most immediate business, his Grace said, should have prevented him\r\nhaving the pleasure of drinking a parting glass to the health of General\r\nWebb. His absence disappointed Esmond's old chief, who suffered much\r\nfrom his wounds besides; and though the company was grand, it was rather\r\ngloomy. St. John came last, and brought a friend with him: \xe2\x80\x9cI'm sure,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says my General, bowing very politely, \xe2\x80\x9cmy table hath always a place for\r\nDr. Swift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond went up to the Doctor with a bow and a smile:--\xe2\x80\x9cI gave Dr.\r\nSwift's message,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cto the printer: I hope he brought your\r\npamphlet to your lodgings in time.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed poor Leach had come to his\r\nhouse very soon after the Doctor left it, being brought away rather\r\ntipsy from the tavern by his thrifty wife; and he talked of Cousin Swift\r\nin a maudlin way, though of course Mr. Esmond did not allude to this\r\nrelationship. The Doctor scowled, blushed, and was much confused, and\r\nsaid scarce a word during the whole of dinner. A very little stone\r\nwill sometimes knock down these Goliaths of wit; and this one was often\r\ndiscomfited when met by a man of any spirit; he took his place sulkily,\r\nput water in his wine that the others drank plentifully, and scarce said\r\na word.\r\n\r\nThe talk was about the affairs of the day, or rather about persons than\r\naffairs: my Lady Marlborough's fury, her daughters in old clothes and\r\nmob-caps looking out from their windows and seeing the company pass to\r\nthe Drawing-room; the gentleman-usher's horror when the Prince of\r\nSavoy was introduced to her Majesty in a tie-wig, no man out of a\r\nfull-bottomed periwig ever having kissed the Royal hand before; about\r\nthe Mohawks and the damage they were doing, rushing through the town,\r\nkilling and murdering. Some one said the ill-omened face of Mohun had\r\nbeen seen at the theatre the night before, and Macartney and Meredith\r\nwith him. Meant to be a feast, the meeting, in spite of drink and talk,\r\nwas as dismal as a funeral. Every topic started subsided into gloom.\r\nHis Grace of Ormonde went away because the conversation got upon Denain,\r\nwhere we had been defeated in the last campaign. Esmond's General\r\nwas affected at the allusion to this action too, for his comrade of\r\nWynendael, the Count of Nassau Woudenbourg, had been slain there. Mr.\r\nSwift, when Esmond pledged him, said he drank no wine, and took his hat\r\nfrom the peg and went away, beckoning my Lord Bolingbroke to follow him;\r\nbut the other bade him take his chariot and save his coach-hire--he had\r\nto speak with Colonel Esmond; and when the rest of the company withdrew\r\nto cards, these two remained behind in the dark.\r\n\r\nBolingbroke always spoke freely when he had drunk freely. His enemies\r\ncould get any secret out of him in that condition; women were even\r\nemployed to ply him, and take his words down. I have heard that my Lord\r\nStair, three years after, when the Secretary fled to France and became\r\nthe Pretender's Minister, got all the information he wanted by putting\r\nfemale spies over St. John in his cups. He spoke freely now:--\xe2\x80\x9cJonathan\r\nknows nothing of this for certain, though he suspects it, and by George,\r\nWebb will take an Archbishopric, and Jonathan a--no,--damme--Jonathan\r\nwill take an Arch-bishopric from James, I warrant me, gladly enough.\r\nYour Duke hath the string of the whole matter in his hand,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nSecretary went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have that which will force Marlborough to keep\r\nhis distance, and he goes out of London in a fortnight. Prior hath his\r\nbusiness; he left me this morning, and mark me, Harry, should fate carry\r\noff our august, our beloved, our most gouty and plethoric Queen, and\r\nDefender of the Faith, la bonne cause triomphera. A la sante de la bonne\r\ncause! Everything good comes from France. Wine comes from France; give\r\nus another bumper to the bonne cause.\xe2\x80\x9d We drank it together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill the bonne cause turn Protestant?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, hang it,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, \xe2\x80\x9che'll defend our Faith as in duty bound,\r\nbut he'll stick by his own. The Hind and the Panther shall run in the\r\nsame car, by Jove. Righteousness and peace shall kiss each other: and\r\nwe'll have Father Massillon to walk down the aisle of St. Paul's, cheek\r\nby jowl with Dr. Sacheverel. Give us more wine; here's a health to the\r\nbonne cause, kneeling--damme, let's drink it kneeling.\xe2\x80\x9d He was quite\r\nflushed and wild with wine as he was talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, who always had this gloomy apprehension,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe bonne cause should give us up to the French, as his father and\r\nuncle did before him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us up to the French!\xe2\x80\x9d starts up Bolingbroke; \xe2\x80\x9cis there any English\r\ngentleman that fears that? You who have seen Blenheim and Ramillies,\r\nafraid of the French! Your ancestors and mine, and brave old Webb's\r\nyonder, have met them in a hundred fields, and our children will be\r\nready to do the like. Who's he that wishes for more men from England? My\r\nCousin Westmoreland? Give us up to the French, pshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis uncle did,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what happened to his grandfather?\xe2\x80\x9d broke out St. John, filling out\r\nanother bumper. \xe2\x80\x9cHere's to the greatest monarch England ever saw; here's\r\nto the Englishman that made a kingdom of her. Our great King came from\r\nHuntingdon, not Hanover; our fathers didn't look for a Dutchman to rule\r\nus. Let him come and we'll keep him, and we'll show him Whitehall. If\r\nhe's a traitor let us have him here to deal with him; and then there are\r\nspirits here as great as any that have gone before. There are men\r\nhere that can look at danger in the face and not be frightened at it.\r\nTraitor! treason! what names are these to scare you and me? Are all\r\nOliver's men dead, or his glorious name forgotten in fifty years? Are\r\nthere no men equal to him, think you, as good--ay, as good? God save the\r\nKing! and, if the monarchy fails us, God save the British Republic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe filled another great bumper, and tossed it up and drained it wildly,\r\njust as the noise of rapid carriage-wheels approaching was stopped at\r\nour door, and after a hurried knock and a moment's interval, Mr. Swift\r\ncame into the hall, ran up stairs to the room we were dining in, and\r\nentered it with a perturbed face. St. John, excited with drink, was\r\nmaking some wild quotation out of Macbeth, but Swift stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink no more, my lord, for God's sake!\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI come with the most\r\ndreadful news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the Queen dead?\xe2\x80\x9d cries out Bolingbroke, seizing on a water-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Duke Hamilton is dead: he was murdered an hour ago by Mohun and\r\nMacartney; they had a quarrel this morning; they gave him not so much\r\ntime as to write a letter. He went for a couple of his friends, and he\r\nis dead, and Mohun, too, the bloody villain, who was set on him. They\r\nfought in Hyde Park just before sunset; the Duke killed Mohun, and\r\nMacartney came up and stabbed him, and the dog is fled. I have your\r\nchariot below; send to every part of the country and apprehend that\r\nvillain; come to the Duke's house and see if any life be left in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Beatrix, Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cand here ends my poor girl's\r\nambition!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPOOR BEATRIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been no need to urge upon Esmond the necessity of a separation\r\nbetween him and Beatrix: Fate had done that completely; and I think from\r\nthe very moment poor Beatrix had accepted the Duke's offer, she began\r\nto assume the majestic air of a Duchess, nay, Queen Elect, and to carry\r\nherself as one sacred and removed from us common people. Her mother\r\nand kinsman both fell into her ways, the latter scornfully perhaps, and\r\nuttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own. There was a certain\r\ncharm about this girl of which neither Colonel Esmond nor his fond\r\nmistress could forego the fascination; in spite of her faults and her\r\npride and wilfulness, they were forced to love her; and, indeed, might\r\nbe set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature's\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nWho, in the course of his life, hath not been so bewitched, and\r\nworshipped some idol or another? Years after this passion hath been dead\r\nand buried, along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions, he\r\nwho felt it can recall it out of its grave, and admire, almost as fondly\r\nas he did in his youth, that lovely queenly creature. I invoke that\r\nbeautiful spirit from the shades and love her still; or rather I should\r\nsay such a past is always present to a man; such a passion once felt\r\nforms a part of his whole being, and cannot be separated from it; it\r\nbecomes a portion of the man of to-day, just as any great faith or\r\nconviction, the discovery of poetry, the awakening of religion, ever\r\nafterwards influence him; just as the wound I had at Blenheim, and of\r\nwhich I wear the scar, hath become part of my frame and influenced my\r\nwhole body, nay, spirit subsequently, though 'twas got and healed forty\r\nyears ago. Parting and forgetting! What faithful heart can do these?\r\nOur great thoughts, our great affections, the Truths of our life, never\r\nleave us. Surely, they cannot separate from our consciousness; shall\r\nfollow it whithersoever that shall go; and are of their nature divine\r\nand immortal.\r\n\r\nWith the horrible news of this catsstrophe, which was confirmed by the\r\nweeping domestics at the Duke's own door, Esmond rode homewards as quick\r\nas his lazy coach would carry him, devising all the time how he should\r\nbreak the intelligence to the person most concerned in it; and if a\r\nsatire upon human vanity could be needed, that poor soul afforded it in\r\nthe altered company and occupations in which Esmond found her. For\r\ndays before, her chariot had been rolling the street from mercer to\r\ntoyshop--from goldsmith to laceman: her taste was perfect, or at least\r\nthe fond bridegroom had thought so, and had given her entire authority\r\nover all tradesmen, and for all the plate, furniture and equipages, with\r\nwhich his Grace the Ambassador wished to adorn his splendid mission. She\r\nmust have her picture by Kneller, a duchess not being complete without\r\na portrait, and a noble one he made, and actually sketched in, on a\r\ncushion, a coronet which she was about to wear. She vowed she would wear\r\nit at King James the Third's coronation, and never a princess in the\r\nland would have become ermine better. Esmond found the ante-chamber\r\ncrowded with milliners and toyshop women, obsequious goldsmiths with\r\njewels, salvers, and tankards; and mercers' men with hangings, and\r\nvelvets, and brocades. My Lady Duchess elect was giving audience to\r\none famous silversmith from Exeter Change, who brought with him a great\r\nchased salver, of which he was pointing out the beauties as Colonel\r\nEsmond entered. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9ccousin, and admire the taste of this\r\npretty thing.\xe2\x80\x9d I think Mars and Venus were lying in the golden bower,\r\nthat one gilt Cupid carried off the war-god's casque--another his\r\nsword--another his great buckler, upon which my Lord Duke Hamilton's\r\narms with ours were to be engraved--and a fourth was kneeling down to\r\nthe reclining goddess with the ducal coronet in her hands, God help us!\r\nThe next time Mr. Esmond saw that piece of plate, the arms were changed,\r\nthe ducal coronet had been replaced by a viscount's; it formed part of\r\nthe fortune of the thrifty goldsmith's own daughter, when she married my\r\nLord Viscount Squanderfield two years after.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't this a beautiful piece?\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, examining it, and she\r\npointed out the arch graces of the Cupids, and the fine carving of the\r\nlanguid prostrate Mars. Esmond sickened as he thought of the warrior\r\ndead in his chamber, his servants and children weeping around him; and\r\nof this smiling creature attiring herself, as it were, for that nuptial\r\ndeath-bed. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis a pretty piece of vanity,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, looking gloomily at\r\nthe beautiful creature: there were flambeaux in the room lighting up the\r\nbrilliant mistress of it. She lifted up the great gold salver with her\r\nfair arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVanity!\xe2\x80\x9d says she, haughtily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is vanity in you, sir, is propriety\r\nin me. You ask a Jewish price for it, Mr. Graves; but have it I will, if\r\nonly to spite Mr. Esmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Beatrix, lay it down!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond. \xe2\x80\x9cHerodias! you know not\r\nwhat you carry in the charger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped it with a clang; the eager goldsmith running to seize\r\nhis fallen ware. The lady's face caught the fright from Esmond's pale\r\ncountenance, and her eyes shone out like beacons of alarm:--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it,\r\nHenry!\xe2\x80\x9d says she, running to him, and seizing both his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou mean by your pale face and gloomy tones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away, come away!\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, leading her: she clung frightened\r\nto him, and he supported her upon his heart, bidding the scared\r\ngoldsmith leave them. The man went into the next apartment, staring with\r\nsurprise, and hugging his precious charger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Beatrix, my sister!\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, still holding in his arms the\r\npallid and affrighted creature, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have the greatest courage of any\r\nwoman in the world; prepare to show it now, for you have a dreadful\r\ntrial to bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sprang away from the friend who would have protected her:--\xe2\x80\x9cHath he\r\nleft me?\xe2\x80\x9d says she. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had words this morning: he was very gloomy, and\r\nI angered him: but he dared not, he dared not!\xe2\x80\x9d As she spoke a burning\r\nblush flushed over her whole face and bosom. Esmond saw it reflected in\r\nthe glass by which she stood, with clenched hands, pressing her swelling\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has left you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, wondering that rage rather than sorrow\r\nwas in her looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Beatrix, \xe2\x80\x9cand you bring me this commission! He\r\nhas left me, and you haven't dared to avenge me! You, that pretend to\r\nbe the champion of our house, have let me suffer this insult! Where is\r\nCastlewood? I will go to my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke is not alive, Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d said Esmond.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her cousin wildly, and fell back to the wall as though\r\nshot in the breast:--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you come here, and--and--you killed him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; thank heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d her kinsman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe blood of that noble heart\r\ndoth not stain my sword! In its last hour it was faithful to thee,\r\nBeatrix Esmond. Vain and cruel woman! kneel and thank the awful heaven\r\nwhich awards life and death, and chastises pride, that the noble\r\nHamilton died true to you; at least that 'twas not your quarrel, or your\r\npride, or your wicked vanity, that drove him to his fate. He died by the\r\nbloody sword which already had drank your own father's blood. O woman, O\r\nsister! to that sad field where two corpses are lying--for the murderer\r\ndied too by the hand of the man he slew--can you bring no mourners but\r\nyour revenge and your vanity? God help and pardon thee, Beatrix, as he\r\nbrings this awful punishment to your hard and rebellious heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsmond had scarce done speaking, when his mistress came in. The colloquy\r\nbetween him and Beatrix had lasted but a few minutes, during which time\r\nEsmond's servant had carried the disastrous news through the household.\r\nThe army of Vanity Fair, waiting without, gathered up all their\r\nfripperies and fled aghast. Tender Lady Castlewood had been in talk\r\nabove with Dean Atterbury, the pious creature's almoner and director;\r\nand the Dean had entered with her as a physician whose place was at\r\na sick-bed. Beatrix's mother looked at Esmond and ran towards her\r\ndaughter, with a pale face and open heart and hands, all kindness\r\nand pity. But Beatrix passed her by, nor would she have any of the\r\nmedicaments of the spiritual physician. \xe2\x80\x9cI am best in my own room and by\r\nmyself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Her eyes were quite dry; nor did Esmond ever see them\r\notherwise, save once, in respect to that grief. She gave him a cold hand\r\nas she went out: \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice, and\r\nwith a simplicity more touching than tears; \xe2\x80\x9call you have said is true\r\nand kind, and I will go away and ask pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d The three others remained\r\nbehind, and talked over the dreadful story. It affected Dr. Atterbury\r\nmore even than us, as it seemed. The death of Mohun, her husband's\r\nmurderer, was more awful to my mistress than even the Duke's unhappy\r\nend. Esmond gave at length what particulars he knew of their quarrel,\r\nand the cause of it. The two noblemen had long been at war with respect\r\nto the Lord Gerard's property, whose two daughters my Lord Duke and\r\nMohun had married. They had met by appointment that day at the lawyer's\r\nin Lincoln's Inn Fields; had words which, though they appeared very\r\ntrifling to those who heard them, were not so to men exasperated by long\r\nand previous enmity. Mohun asked my Lord Duke where he could see his\r\nGrace's friends, and within an hour had sent two of his own to arrange\r\nthis deadly duel. It was pursued with such fierceness, and sprung from\r\nso trifling a cause, that all men agreed at the time that there was\r\na party, of which these three notorious brawlers were but agents, who\r\ndesired to take Duke Hamilton's life away. They fought three on a side,\r\nas in that tragic meeting twelve years back, which hath been recounted\r\nalready, and in which Mohun performed his second murder. They rushed\r\nin, and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing\r\nof swords even, and stabbed one at the other desperately, each receiving\r\nmany wounds; and Mohun having his death-wound, and my Lord Duke lying\r\nby him, Macartney came up and stabbed his Grace as he lay on the ground,\r\nand gave him the blow of which he died. Colonel Macartney denied\r\nthis, of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would\r\nnevertheless have him guilty, and fled the country, whither he never\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nWhat was the real cause of the Duke Hamilton's death?--a paltry quarrel\r\nthat might easily have been made up, and with a ruffian so low, base,\r\nprofligate, and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders, that\r\na man of such renown and princely rank as my Lord Duke might have\r\ndisdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain. But his\r\nspirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage\r\nwas like his charity, and never turned any man away; and he died by the\r\nhands of Mohun, and the other two cut-throats that were set on him. The\r\nQueen's ambassador to Paris died, the loyal and devoted servant of the\r\nHouse of Stuart, and a Royal Prince of Scotland himself, and carrying\r\nthe confidence, the repentance of Queen Anne along with his own open\r\ndevotion, and the good-will of millions in the country more, to the\r\nQueen's exiled brother and sovereign.\r\n\r\nThat party to which Lord Mohun belonged had the benefit of his\r\nservice, and now were well rid of such a ruffian. He, and Meredith, and\r\nMacartney, were the Duke of Marlborough's men; and the two colonels had\r\nbeen broke but the year before for drinking perdition to the Tories. His\r\nGrace was a Whig now and a Hanoverian, and as eager for war as Prince\r\nEugene himself. I say not that he was privy to Duke Hamilton's death, I\r\nsay that his party profited by it; and that three desperate and bloody\r\ninstruments were found to effect that murder.\r\n\r\nAs Esmond and the Dean walked away from Kensington discoursing of this\r\ntragedy, and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart,\r\nthe street-criers were already out with their broadsides, shouting\r\nthrough the town the full, true, and horrible account of the death of\r\nLord Mohun and Duke Hamilton in a duel. A fellow had got to Kensington,\r\nand was crying it in the square there at very early morning, when Mr.\r\nEsmond happened to pass by. He drove the man from under Beatrix's very\r\nwindow, whereof the casement had been set open. The sun was shining\r\nthough 'twas November: he had seen the market-carts rolling into London,\r\nthe guard relieved at the palace, the laborers trudging to their work in\r\nthe gardens between Kensington and the City--the wandering merchants\r\nand hawkers filling the air with their cries. The world was going to its\r\nbusiness again, although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them; and\r\nkings, very likely, lost their chances. So night and day pass away,\r\nand to-morrow comes, and our place knows us not. Esmond thought of the\r\ncourier, now galloping on the North road to inform him, who was Earl of\r\nArran yesterday, that he was Duke of Hamilton to-day, and of a thousand\r\ngreat schemes, hopes, ambitions, that were alive in the gallant heart,\r\nbeating a few hours since, and now in a little dust quiescent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nI VISIT CASTLEWOOD ONCE MORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, for a third time, Beatrix's ambitious hopes were circumvented, and\r\nshe might well believe that a special malignant fate watched and pursued\r\nher, tearing her prize out of her hand just as she seemed to grasp it,\r\nand leaving her with only rage and grief for her portion. Whatever her\r\nfeelings might have been of anger or of sorrow, (and I fear me that the\r\nformer emotion was that which most tore her heart,) she would take no\r\nconfidant, as people of softer natures would have done under such a\r\ncalamity; her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their\r\npity, and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound\r\nwhich fortune had inflicted. We knew that her pride was awfully humbled\r\nand punished by this sudden and terrible blow; she wanted no teaching of\r\nours to point out the sad moral of her story. Her fond mother could give\r\nbut her prayers, and her kinsman his faithful friendship and patience to\r\nthe unhappy, stricken creature; and it was only by hints, and a word or\r\ntwo uttered months afterwards, that Beatrix showed she understood their\r\nsilent commiseration, and on her part was secretly thankful for their\r\nforbearance. The people about the Court said there was that in her\r\nmanner which frightened away scoffing and condolence: she was above\r\ntheir triumph and their pity, and acted her part in that dreadful\r\ntragedy greatly and courageously; so that those who liked her least were\r\nyet forced to admire her. We, who watched her after her disaster, could\r\nnot but respect the indomitable courage and majestic calm with which she\r\nbore it. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather see her tears than her pride,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother said,\r\nwho was accustomed to bear her sorrows in a very different way, and\r\nto receive them as the stroke of God, with an awful submission and\r\nmeekness. But Beatrix's nature was different to that tender parent's;\r\nshe seemed to accept her grief and to defy it; nor would she allow it (I\r\nbelieve not even in private and in her own chamber) to extort from her\r\nthe confession of even a tear of humiliation or a cry of pain. Friends\r\nand children of our race, who come after me, in which way will you bear\r\nyour trials? I know one that prays God will give you love rather than\r\npride, and that the Eye all-seeing shall find you in the humble place.\r\nNot that we should judge proud spirits otherwise than charitably. 'Tis\r\nnature hath fashioned some for ambition and dominion, as it hath formed\r\nothers for obedience and gentle submission. The leopard follows his\r\nnature as the lamb does, and acts after leopard law; she can neither\r\nhelp her beauty, nor her courage, nor her cruelty; nor a single spot on\r\nher shining coat; nor the conquering spirit which impels her; nor the\r\nshot which brings her down.\r\n\r\nDuring that well-founded panic the Whigs had, lest the Queen should\r\nforsake their Hanoverian Prince, bound by oaths and treaties as she was\r\nto him, and recall her brother, who was allied to her by yet stronger\r\nties of nature and duty; the Prince of Savoy, and the boldest of that\r\nparty of the Whigs, were for bringing the young Duke of Cambridge over,\r\nin spite of the Queen, and the outcry of her Tory servants, arguing that\r\nthe Electoral Prince, a Peer and Prince of the Blood-Royal of this Realm\r\ntoo, and in the line of succession to the crown, had, a right to sit\r\nin the Parliament whereof he was a member, and to dwell in the country\r\nwhich he one day was to govern. Nothing but the strongest ill will\r\nexpressed by the Queen, and the people about her, and menaces of the\r\nRoyal resentment, should this scheme be persisted in, prevented it from\r\nbeing carried into effect.\r\n\r\nThe boldest on our side were, in like manner, for having our Prince into\r\nthe country. The undoubted inheritor of the right divine; the feelings\r\nof more than half the nation, of almost all the clergy, of the gentry of\r\nEngland and Scotland with him; entirely innocent of the crime for which\r\nhis father suffered--brave, young, handsome, unfortunate--who in England\r\nwould dare to molest the Prince should he come among us, and fling\r\nhimself upon British generosity, hospitality, and honor? An invader with\r\nan army of Frenchmen behind him, Englishmen of spirit would resist to\r\nthe death, and drive back to the shores whence he came; but a Prince,\r\nalone, armed with his right only, and relying on the loyalty of his\r\npeople, was sure, many of his friends argued, of welcome, at least of\r\nsafety, among us. The hand of his sister the Queen, of the people his\r\nsubjects, never could be raised to do him a wrong. But the Queen was\r\ntimid by nature, and the successive Ministers she had, had private\r\ncauses for their irresolution. The bolder and honester men, who had at\r\nheart the illustrious young exile's cause, had no scheme of interest of\r\ntheir own to prevent them from seeing the right done, and, provided only\r\nhe came as an Englishman, were ready to venture their all to welcome and\r\ndefend him.\r\n\r\nSt. John and Harley both had kind words in plenty for the Prince's\r\nadherents, and gave him endless promises of future support; but hints\r\nand promises were all they could be got to give; and some of his friends\r\nwere for measures much bolder, more efficacious, and more open. With\r\na party of these, some of whom are yet alive, and some whose names Mr.\r\nEsmond has no right to mention, he found himself engaged the year after\r\nthat miserable death of Duke Hamilton, which deprived the Prince of\r\nhis most courageous ally in this country. Dean Atterbury was one of the\r\nfriends whom Esmond may mention, as the brave bishop is now beyond exile\r\nand persecution, and to him, and one or two more, the Colonel opened\r\nhimself of a scheme of his own, that, backed by a little resolution on\r\nthe Prince's part, could not fail of bringing about the accomplishment\r\nof their dearest wishes.\r\n\r\nMy young Lord Viscount Castlewood had not come to England to keep his\r\nmajority, and had now been absent from the country for several years.\r\nThe year when his sister was to be married and Duke Hamilton died, my\r\nlord was kept at Bruxelles by his wife's lying-in. The gentle Clotilda\r\ncould not bear her husband out of her sight; perhaps she mistrusted the\r\nyoung scapegrace should he ever get loose from her leading-strings; and\r\nshe kept him by her side to nurse the baby and administer posset to the\r\ngossips. Many a laugh poor Beatrix had had about Frank's uxoriousness:\r\nhis mother would have gone to Clotilda when her time was coming, but\r\nthat the mother-in-law was already in possession, and the negotiations\r\nfor poor Beatrix's marriage were begun. A few months after the horrid\r\ncatastrophe in Hyde Park, my mistress and her daughter retired to\r\nCastlewood, where my lord, it was expected, would soon join them. But,\r\nto say truth, their quiet household was little to his taste; he could be\r\ngot to come to Walcote but once after his first campaign; and then the\r\nyoung rogue spent more than half his time in London, not appearing at\r\nCourt or in public under his own name and title, but frequenting plays,\r\nbagnios, and the very worst company, under the name of Captain Esmond\r\n(whereby his innocent kinsman got more than once into trouble); and so\r\nunder various pretexts, and in pursuit of all sorts of pleasures,\r\nuntil he plunged into the lawful one of marriage, Frank Castlewood\r\nhad remained away from this country, and was unknown, save amongst the\r\ngentlemen of the army, with whom he had served abroad. The fond heart of\r\nhis mother was pained by this long absence. 'Twas all that Henry Esmond\r\ncould do to soothe her natural mortification, and find excuses for his\r\nkinsman's levity.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the year 1713, Lord Castlewood thought of returning\r\nhome. His first child had been a daughter; Clotilda was in the way of\r\ngratifying his lordship with a second, and the pious youth thought that,\r\nby bringing his wife to his ancestral home, by prayers to St. Philip of\r\nCastlewood, and what not, heaven might be induced to bless him with a\r\nson this time, for whose coming the expectant mamma was very anxious.\r\n\r\nThe long-debated peace had been proclaimed this year at the end of\r\nMarch; and France was open to us. Just as Frank's poor mother had\r\nmade all things ready for Lord Castlewood's reception, and was eagerly\r\nexpecting her son, it was by Colonel Esmond's means that the kind lady\r\nwas disappointed of her longing, and obliged to defer once more the\r\ndarling hope of her heart.\r\n\r\nEsmond took horses to Castlewood. He had not seen its ancient gray\r\ntowers and well-remembered woods for nearly fourteen years, and since he\r\nrode thence with my lord, to whom his mistress with her young children\r\nby her side waved an adieu. What ages seemed to have passed since then,\r\nwhat years of action and passion, of care, love, hope, disaster! The\r\nchildren were grown up now, and had stories of their own. As for\r\nEsmond, he felt to be a hundred years old; his dear mistress only seemed\r\nunchanged; she looked and welcomed him quite as of old. There was the\r\nfountain in the court babbling its familiar music, the old hall and its\r\nfurniture, the carved chair my late lord used, the very flagon he drank\r\nfrom. Esmond's mistress knew he would like to sleep in the little room\r\nhe used to occupy; 'twas made ready for him, and wall-flowers and sweet\r\nherbs set in the adjoining chamber, the chaplain's room.\r\n\r\nIn tears of not unmanly emotion, with prayers of submission to the awful\r\nDispenser of death and life, of good and evil fortune, Mr. Esmond passed\r\na part of that first night at Castlewood, lying awake for many hours as\r\nthe clock kept tolling (in tones so well remembered), looking back, as\r\nall men will, that revisit their home of childhood, over the great gulf\r\nof time, and surveying himself on the distant bank yonder, a sad little\r\nmelancholy boy with his lord still alive--his dear mistress, a girl yet,\r\nher children sporting around her. Years ago, a boy on that very bed,\r\nwhen she had blessed him and called him her knight, he had made a vow\r\nto be faithful and never desert her dear service. Had he kept that fond\r\nboyish promise? Yes, before heaven; yes, praise be to God! His life had\r\nbeen hers; his blood, his fortune, his name, his whole heart ever since\r\nhad been hers and her children's. All night long he was dreaming his\r\nboyhood over again, and waking fitfully; he half fancied he heard Father\r\nHolt calling to him from the next chamber, and that he was coming in and\r\nout of from the mysterious window.\r\n\r\nEsmond rose up before the dawn, passed into the next room, where the\r\nair was heavy with the odor of the wall-flowers; looked into the brazier\r\nwhere the papers had been burnt, into the old presses where Holt's books\r\nand papers had been kept, and tried the spring and whether the window\r\nworked still. The spring had not been touched for years, but yielded at\r\nlength, and the whole fabric of the window sank down. He lifted it and\r\nit relapsed into its frame; no one had ever passed thence since Holt\r\nused it sixteen years ago.\r\n\r\nEsmond remembered his poor lord saying, on the last day of his life,\r\nthat Holt used to come in and out of the house like a ghost, and\r\nknew that the Father liked these mysteries, and practised such secret\r\ndisguises, entrances and exits: this was the way the ghost came and\r\nwent, his pupil had always conjectured. Esmond closed the casement up\r\nagain as the dawn was rising over Castlewood village; he could hear the\r\nclinking at the blacksmith's forge yonder among the trees, across the\r\ngreen, and past the river, on which a mist still lay sleeping.\r\n\r\nNext Esmond opened that long cupboard over the woodwork of the\r\nmantel-piece, big enough to hold a man, and in which Mr. Holt used to\r\nkeep sundry secret properties of his. The two swords he remembered so\r\nwell as a boy, lay actually there still, and Esmond took them out and\r\nwiped them, with a strange curiosity of emotion. There were a bundle of\r\npapers here, too, which no doubt had been left at Holt's last visit to\r\nthe place, in my Lord Viscount's life, that very day when the priest had\r\nbeen arrested and taken to Hexham Castle. Esmond made free with these\r\npapers, and found treasonable matter of King William's reign, the names\r\nof Charnock and Perkins, Sir John Fenwick and Sir John Friend, Rookwood\r\nand Lodwick, Lords Montgomery and Allesbury, Clarendon and Yarmouth,\r\nthat had all been engaged in plots against the usurper; a letter from\r\nthe Duke of Berwick too, and one from the King at St. Germains, offering\r\nto confer upon his trusty and well-beloved Francis Viscount Castlewood\r\nthe titles of Earl and Marquis of Esmond, bestowed by patent royal, and\r\nin the fourth year of his reign, upon Thomas Viscount Castlewood and\r\nthe heirs-male of his body, in default of which issue the ranks and\r\ndignities were to pass to Francis aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThis was the paper, whereof my lord had spoken, which Holt showed him\r\nthe very day he was arrested, and for an answer to which he would come\r\nback in a week's time. I put these papers hastily into the crypt whence\r\nI had taken them, being interrupted by a tapping of a light finger at\r\nthe ring of the chamber-door: 'twas my kind mistress, with her face full\r\nof love and welcome. She, too, had passed the night wakefuly, no doubt;\r\nbut neither asked the other how the hours had been spent. There are\r\nthings we divine without speaking, and know though they happen out of\r\nour sight. This fond lady hath told me that she knew both days when\r\nI was wounded abroad. Who shall say how far sympathy reaches, and how\r\ntruly love can prophesy? \xe2\x80\x9cI looked into your room,\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe bed was vacant, the little old bed! I knew I should find you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And tender and blushing faintly with a benediction in her eyes, the\r\ngentle creature kissed him.\r\n\r\nThey walked out, hand-in-hand, through the old court, and to the\r\nterrace-walk, where the grass was glistening with dew, and the birds in\r\nthe green woods above were singing their delicious choruses under the\r\nblushing morning sky. How well all things were remembered! The ancient\r\ntowers and gables of the hall darkling against the east, the purple\r\nshadows on the green slopes, the quaint devices and carvings of the\r\ndial, the forest-crowned heights, the fair yellow plain cheerful with\r\ncrops and corn, the shining river rolling through it towards the pearly\r\nhills beyond; all these were before us, along with a thousand beautiful\r\nmemories of our youth, beautiful and sad, but as real and vivid in our\r\nminds as that fair and always-remembered scene our eyes beheld once\r\nmore. We forget nothing. The memory sleeps, but wakens again; I often\r\nthink how it shall be when, after the last sleep of death, the\r\nreveillee shall arouse us for ever, and the past in one flash of\r\nself-consciousness rush back, like the soul revivified.\r\n\r\nThe house would not be up for some hours yet, (it was July, and the dawn\r\nwas only just awake,) and here Esmond opened himself to his mistress, of\r\nthe business he had in hand, and what part Frank was to play in it. He\r\nknew he could confide anything to her, and that the fond soul would die\r\nrather than reveal it; and bidding her keep the secret from all, he laid\r\nit entirely before his mistress (always as staunch a little loyalist as\r\nany in the kingdom), and indeed was quite sure that any plan, of his was\r\nsecure of her applause and sympathy. Never was such a glorious scheme to\r\nher partial mind, never such a devoted knight to execute it. An hour or\r\ntwo may have passed whilst they were having their colloquy. Beatrix came\r\nout to them just as their talk was over; her tall beautiful form robed\r\nin sable (which she wore without ostentation ever since last year's\r\ncatastrophe), sweeping over the green terrace, and casting its shadows\r\nbefore her across the grass.\r\n\r\nShe made us one of her grand curtsies smiling, and called us \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nyoung people.\xe2\x80\x9d She was older, paler, and more majestic than in the year\r\nbefore; her mother seemed the youngest of the two. She never once spoke\r\nof her grief, Lady Castlewood told Esmond, or alluded, save by a quiet\r\nword or two, to the death of her hopes.\r\n\r\nWhen Beatrix came back to Castlewood she took to visiting all the\r\ncottages and all the sick. She set up a school of children, and taught\r\nsinging to some of them. We had a pair of beautiful old organs in\r\nCastlewood Church, on which she played admirably, so that the music\r\nthere became to be known in the country for many miles round, and no\r\ndoubt people came to see the fair organist as well as to hear her.\r\nParson Tusher and his wife were established at the vicarage, but his\r\nwife had brought him no children wherewith Tom might meet his enemies\r\nat the gate. Honest Tom took care not to have many such, his great\r\nshovel-hat was in his hand for everybody. He was profuse of bows\r\nand compliments. He behaved to Esmond as if the Colonel had been a\r\nCommander-in-Chief; he dined at the hall that day, being Sunday, and\r\nwould not partake of pudding except under extreme pressure. He deplored\r\nmy lord's perversion, but drank his lordship's health very devoutly;\r\nand an hour before at church sent the Colonel to sleep, with a long,\r\nlearned, and refreshing sermon.\r\n\r\nEsmond's visit home was but for two days; the business he had in hand\r\ncalling him away and out of the country. Ere he went, he saw Beatrix\r\nbut once alone, and then she summoned him out of the long tapestry room,\r\nwhere he and his mistress were sitting, quite as in old times, into\r\nthe adjoining chamber, that had been Viscountess Isabel's sleeping\r\napartment, and where Esmond perfectly well remembered seeing the old\r\nlady sitting up in the bed, in her night-rail, that morning when the\r\ntroop of guard came to fetch her. The most beautiful woman in England\r\nlay in that bed now, whereof the great damask hangings were scarce faded\r\nsince Esmond saw them last.\r\n\r\nHere stood Beatrix in her black robes, holding a box in her hand; 'twas\r\nthat which Esmond had given her before her marriage, stamped with a\r\ncoronet which the disappointed girl was never to wear; and containing\r\nhis aunt's legacy of diamonds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had best take these with you, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d says she; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no need\r\nof diamonds any more.\xe2\x80\x9d There was not the least token of emotion in her\r\nquiet low voice. She held out the black shagreen case with her fair\r\narm, that did not shake in the least. Esmond saw she wore a black velvet\r\nbracelet on it, with my Lord Duke's picture in enamel; he had given it\r\nher but three days before he fell.\r\n\r\nEsmond said the stones were his no longer, and strove to turn off that\r\nproffered restoration with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cOf what good,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9care they\r\nto me? The diamond loop to his hat did not set off Prince Eugene, and\r\nwill not make my yellow face look any handsomer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will give them to your wife, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d says she. \xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin, your\r\nwife has a lovely complexion and shape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond burst out, the old fire flaming out as it would at\r\ntimes, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you wear those trinkets at your marriage? You whispered\r\nonce you did not know me: you know me better now: how I sought, what I\r\nhave sighed for, for ten years, what foregone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA price for your constancy, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d says she; \xe2\x80\x9csuch a preux chevalier\r\nwants to be paid. Oh fie, cousin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond spoke out, \xe2\x80\x9cif I do something you have at heart;\r\nsomething worthy of me and you; something that shall make me a name with\r\nwhich to endow you; will you take it? There was a chance for me once,\r\nyou said; is it impossible to recall it? Never shake your head, but hear\r\nme; say you will hear me a year hence. If I come back to you and bring\r\nyou fame, will that please you? If I do what you desire most--what he\r\nwho is dead desired most--will that soften you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d says she, her face lighting up; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat mean you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk no questions,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwait, and give me but time; if I bring\r\nback that you long for, that I have a thousand times heard you pray for,\r\nwill you have no reward for him who has done you that service? Put away\r\nthose trinkets, keep them: it shall not be at my marriage, it shall not\r\nbe at yours; but if man can do it, I swear a day shall come when there\r\nshall be a feast in your house, and you shall be proud to wear them. I\r\nsay no more now; put aside these words, and lock away yonder box until\r\nthe day when I shall remind you of both. All I pray of you now is, to\r\nwait and to remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going out of the country?\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, in some agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Lorraine, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, laying her hand on his arm; 'twas\r\nthe hand on which she wore the Duke's bracelet. \xe2\x80\x9cStay, Harry!\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nshe, with a tone that had more despondency in it than she was accustomed\r\nto show. \xe2\x80\x9cHear a last word. I do love you. I do admire you--who would\r\nnot, that has known such love as yours has been for us all? But I think\r\nI have no heart; at least I have never seen the man that could touch it;\r\nand, had I found him, I would have followed him in rags had he been a\r\nprivate soldier, or to sea, like one of those buccaneers you used to\r\nread to us about when we were children. I would do anything for such\r\na man, bear anything for him: but I never found one. You were ever too\r\nmuch of a slave to win my heart; even my Lord Duke could not command it.\r\nI had not been happy had I married him. I knew that three months after\r\nour engagement--and was too vain to break it. Oh, Harry! I cried once or\r\ntwice, not for him, but with tears of rage because I could not be sorry\r\nfor him. I was frightened to find I was glad of his death; and were\r\nI joined to you, I should have the same sense of servitude, the same\r\nlonging to escape. We should both be unhappy, and you the most, who are\r\nas jealous as the Duke was himself. I tried to love him; I tried, indeed\r\nI did: affected gladness when he came: submitted to hear when he was by\r\nme, and tried the wife's part I thought I was to play for the rest of my\r\ndays. But half an hour of that complaisance wearied me, and what would\r\na lifetime be? My thoughts were away when he was speaking; and I was\r\nthinking, Oh that this man would drop my hand, and rise up from before\r\nmy feet! I knew his great and noble qualities, greater and nobler than\r\nmine a thousand times, as yours are, cousin, I tell you, a million and a\r\nmillion times better. But 'twas not for these I took him. I took him to\r\nhave a great place in the world, and I lost it. I lost it, and do not\r\ndeplore him--and I often thought, as I listened to his fond vows and\r\nardent words, Oh, if I yield to this man, and meet THE OTHER, I shall\r\nhate him and leave him! I am not good, Harry: my mother is gentle and\r\ngood like an angel. I wonder how she should have had such a child. She\r\nis weak, but she would die rather than do a wrong; I am stronger than\r\nshe, but I would do it out of defiance. I do not care for what the\r\nparsons tell me with their droning sermons: I used to see them at court\r\nas mean and as worthless as the meanest woman there. Oh, I am sick and\r\nweary of the world! I wait but for one thing, and when 'tis done, I will\r\ntake Frank's religion and your poor mother's, and go into a nunnery, and\r\nend like her. Shall I wear the diamonds then?--they say the nuns wear\r\ntheir best trinkets the day they take the veil. I will put them away as\r\nyou bid me; farewell, cousin: mamma is pacing the next room racking her\r\nlittle head to know what we have been saying. She is jealous, all women\r\nare. I sometimes think that is the only womanly quality I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell. Farewell, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave him her cheek as a brotherly\r\nprivilege. The cheek was as cold as marble.\r\n\r\nEsmond's mistress showed no signs of jealousy when he returned to\r\nthe room where she was. She had schooled herself so as to look quite\r\ninscrutably, when she had a mind. Amongst her other feminine qualities\r\nshe had that of being a perfect dissembler.\r\n\r\nHe rode away from Castlewood to attempt the task he was bound on, and\r\nstand or fall by it; in truth his state of mind was such, that he was\r\neager for some outward excitement to counteract that gnawing malady\r\nwhich he was inwardly enduring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nI TRAVEL TO FRANCE AND BRING HOME A PORTRAIT OF RIGAUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond did not think fit to take leave at Court, or to inform all\r\nthe world of Pall Mall and the coffee-houses, that he was about to quit\r\nEngland; and chose to depart in the most private manner possible. He\r\nprocured a pass as for a Frenchman, through Dr. Atterbury, who did that\r\nbusiness for him, getting the signature even from Lord Bolingbroke's\r\noffice, without any personal application to the Secretary. Lockwood, his\r\nfaithful servant, he took with him to Castlewood, and left behind there:\r\ngiving out ere he left London that he himself was sick, and gone to\r\nHampshire for country air, and so departed as silently as might be upon\r\nhis business.\r\n\r\nAs Frank Castlewood's aid was indispensable for Mr. Esmond's scheme, his\r\nfirst visit was to Bruxelles (passing by way of Antwerp, where the Duke\r\nof Marlborough was in exile), and in the first-named place Harry found\r\nhis dear young Benedict, the married man, who appeared to be rather\r\nout of humor with his matrimonial chain, and clogged with the obstinate\r\nembraces which Clotilda kept round his neck. Colonel Esmond was not\r\npresented to her; but Monsieur Simon was, a gentleman of the Royal\r\nCravat (Esmond bethought him of the regiment of his honest Irishman,\r\nwhom he had seen that day after Malplaquet, when he first set eyes on\r\nthe young King); and Monsieur Simon was introduced to the Viscountess\r\nCastlewood, nee Comptesse Wertheim; to the numerous counts, the Lady\r\nClotilda's tall brothers; to her father the chamberlain; and to the lady\r\nhis wife, Frank's mother-in-law, a tall and majestic person of large\r\nproportions, such as became the mother of such a company of grenadiers\r\nas her warlike sons formed. The whole race were at free quarters in the\r\nlittle castle nigh to Bruxelles which Frank had taken; rode his horses;\r\ndrank his wine; and lived easily at the poor lad's charges. Mr. Esmond\r\nhad always maintained a perfect fluency in the French, which was his\r\nmother tongue; and if this family (that spoke French with the twang\r\nwhich the Flemings use) discovered any inaccuracy in Mr. Simon's\r\npronunciation, 'twas to be attributed to the latter's long residence\r\nin England, where he had married and remained ever since he was taken\r\nprisoner at Blenheim. His story was perfectly pat; there were none there\r\nto doubt it save honest Frank, and he was charmed with his kinsman's\r\nscheme, when he became acquainted with it; and, in truth, always admired\r\nColonel Esmond with an affectionate fidelity, and thought his cousin\r\nthe wisest and best of all cousins and men. Frank entered heart and soul\r\ninto the plan, and liked it the better as it was to take him to Paris,\r\nout of reach of his brothers, his father, and his mother-in-law, whose\r\nattentions rather fatigued him.\r\n\r\nCastlewood, I have said, was born in the same year as the Prince of\r\nWales; had not a little of the Prince's air, height, and figure; and,\r\nespecially since he had seen the Chevalier de St. George on the occasion\r\nbefore-named, took no small pride in his resemblance to a person so\r\nillustrious; which likeness he increased by all means in his power,\r\nwearing fair brown periwigs, such as the Prince wore, and ribbons, and\r\nso forth, of the Chevalier's color.\r\n\r\nThis resemblance was, in truth, the circumstance on which Mr. Esmond's\r\nscheme was founded; and having secured Frank's secrecy and enthusiasm,\r\nhe left him to continue his journey, and see the other personages on\r\nwhom its success depended. The place whither Mr. Simon next travelled\r\nwas Bar, in Lorraine, where that merchant arrived with a consignment\r\nof broadcloths, valuable laces from Malines, and letters for his\r\ncorrespondent there.\r\n\r\nWould you know how a prince, heroic from misfortunes, and descended\r\nfrom a line of kings, whose race seemed to be doomed like the Atridae of\r\nold--would you know how he was employed, when the envoy who came to him\r\nthrough danger and difficulty beheld him for the first time? The young\r\nking, in a flannel jacket, was at tennis with the gentlemen of his\r\nsuite, crying out after the balls, and swearing like the meanest of his\r\nsubjects. The next time Mr. Esmond saw him, 'twas when Monsieur Simon\r\ntook a packet of laces to Miss Oglethorpe: the Prince's ante-chamber in\r\nthose days, at which ignoble door men were forced to knock for admission\r\nto his Majesty. The admission was given, the envoy found the King and\r\nthe mistress together; the pair were at cards and his Majesty was\r\nin liquor. He cared more for three honors than three kingdoms; and\r\na half-dozen glasses of ratafia made him forget all his woes and his\r\nlosses, his father's crown, and his grandfather's head.\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond did not open himself to the Prince then. His Majesty was\r\nscarce in a condition to hear him; and he doubted whether a King who\r\ndrank so much could keep a secret in his fuddled head; or whether a hand\r\nthat shook so, was strong enough to grasp at a crown. However, at last,\r\nand after taking counsel with the Prince's advisers, amongst whom were\r\nmany gentlemen, honest and faithful, Esmond's plan was laid before the\r\nKing, and her actual Majesty Queen Oglethorpe, in council. The Prince\r\nliked the scheme well enough; 'twas easy and daring, and suited to his\r\nreckless gayety and lively youthful spirit. In the morning after he had\r\nslept his wine off, he was very gay, lively, and agreeable. His manner\r\nhad an extreme charm of archness, and a kind simplicity; and, to do her\r\njustice, her Oglethorpean Majesty was kind, acute, resolute, and of good\r\ncounsel; she gave the Prince much good advice that he was too weak\r\nto follow, and loved him with a fidelity which he returned with an\r\ningratitude quite Royal.\r\n\r\nHaving his own forebodings regarding his scheme should it ever be\r\nfulfilled, and his usual sceptic doubts as to the benefit which might\r\naccrue to the country by bringing a tipsy young monarch back to it,\r\nColonel Esmond had his audience of leave and quiet. Monsieur Simon took\r\nhis departure. At any rate the youth at Bar was as good as the older\r\nPretender at Hanover; if the worst came to the worst, the Englishman\r\ncould be dealt with as easy as the German. Monsieur Simon trotted\r\non that long journey from Nancy to Paris, and saw that famous town,\r\nstealthily and like a spy, as in truth he was; and where, sure, more\r\nmagnificence and more misery is heaped together, more rags and lace,\r\nmore filth and gilding, than in any city in this world. Here he was\r\nput in communication with the King's best friend, his half brother, the\r\nfamous Duke of Berwick; Esmond recognized him as the stranger who had\r\nvisited Castlewood now near twenty years ago. His Grace opened to him\r\nwhen he found that Mr. Esmond was one of Webb's brave regiment, that had\r\nonce been his Grace's own. He was the sword and buckler indeed of the\r\nStuart cause: there was no stain on his shield except the bar across it,\r\nwhich Marlborough's sister left him. Had Berwick been his father's heir,\r\nJames the Third had assuredly sat on the English throne. He could dare,\r\nendure, strike, speak, be silent. The fire and genius, perhaps, he had\r\nnot (that were given to baser men), but except these he had some of the\r\nbest qualities of a leader. His Grace knew Esmond's father and history;\r\nand hinted at the latter in such a way as made the Colonel to think he\r\nwas aware of the particulars of that story. But Esmond did not choose to\r\nenter on it, nor did the Duke press him. Mr. Esmond said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt he\r\nshould come by his name if ever greater people came by theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat confirmed Esmond in his notion that the Duke of Berwick knew of his\r\ncase was, that when the Colonel went to pay his duty at St. Germains,\r\nher Majesty once addressed him by the title of Marquis. He took the\r\nQueen the dutiful remembrances of her goddaughter, and the lady whom,\r\nin the days of her prosperity, her Majesty had befriended. The\r\nQueen remembered Rachel Esmond perfectly well, had heard of my Lord\r\nCastlewood's conversion, and was much edified by that act of heaven in\r\nhis favor. She knew that others of that family had been of the only true\r\nchurch too: \xe2\x80\x9cYour father and your mother, M. le Marquis,\xe2\x80\x9d her Majesty\r\nsaid (that was the only time she used the phrase). Monsieur Simon bowed\r\nvery low, and said he had found other parents than his own, who had\r\ntaught him differently; but these had only one king: on which her\r\nMajesty was pleased to give him a medal blessed by the Pope, which had\r\nbeen found very efficacious in cases similar to his own, and to promise\r\nshe would offer up prayers for his conversion and that of the family:\r\nwhich no doubt this pious lady did, though up to the present moment, and\r\nafter twenty-seven years, Colonel Esmond is bound to say that neither\r\nthe medal nor the prayers have had the slightest known effect upon his\r\nreligious convictions.\r\n\r\nAs for the splendors of Versailles, Monsieur Simon, the merchant, only\r\nbeheld them as a humble and distant spectator, seeing the old King but\r\nonce, when he went to feed his carps; and asking for no presentation at\r\nhis Majesty's Court.\r\n\r\nBy this time my Lord Viscount Castlewood was got to Paris, where, as the\r\nLondon prints presently announced, her ladyship was brought to bed of a\r\nson and heir. For a long while afterwards she was in a delicate state\r\nof health, and ordered by the physicians not to travel; otherwise 'twas\r\nwell known that the Viscount Castlewood proposed returning to England,\r\nand taking up his residence at his own seat.\r\n\r\nWhilst he remained at Paris, my Lord Castlewood had his picture done by\r\nthe famous French painter, Monsieur Rigaud, a present for his mother\r\nin London; and this piece Monsieur Simon took back with him when he\r\nreturned to that city, which he reached about May, in the year 1714,\r\nvery soon after which time my Lady Castlewood and her daughter, and\r\ntheir kinsman, Colonel Esmond, who had been at Castlewood all this\r\ntime, likewise returned to London; her ladyship occupying her house\r\nat Kensington, Mr. Esmond returning to his lodgings at Knightsbridge,\r\nnearer the town, and once more making his appearance at all public\r\nplaces, his health greatly improved by his long stay in the country.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of my lord, in a handsome gilt frame, was hung up in\r\nthe place of honor in her ladyship's drawing-room. His lordship was\r\nrepresented in his scarlet uniform of Captain of the Guard, with a light\r\nbrown periwig, a cuirass under his coat, a blue ribbon, and a fall of\r\nBruxelles lace. Many of her ladyship's friends admired the piece beyond\r\nmeasure, and flocked to see it; Bishop Atterbury, Mr. Lesly, good old\r\nMr. Collier, and others amongst the clergy, were delighted with the\r\nperformance, and many among the first quality examined and praised it;\r\nonly I must own that Doctor Tusher happening to come up to London, and\r\nseeing the picture, (it was ordinarily covered by a curtain, but on this\r\nday Miss Beatrix happened to be looking at it when the Doctor arrived,)\r\nthe Vicar of Castlewood vowed he could not see any resemblance in the\r\npiece to his old pupil, except, perhaps, a little about the chin and the\r\nperiwig; but we all of us convinced him that he had not seen Frank for\r\nfive years or more; that he knew no more about the Fine Arts than a\r\nploughboy, and that he must be mistaken; and we sent him home assured\r\nthat the piece was an excellent likeness. As for my Lord Bolingbroke,\r\nwho honored her ladyship with a visit occasionally, when Colonel Esmond\r\nshowed him the picture he burst out laughing, and asked what devilry he\r\nwas engaged on? Esmond owned simply that the portrait was not that of\r\nViscount Castlewood; besought the Secretary on his honor to keep the\r\nsecret; said that the ladies of the house were enthusiastic Jacobites,\r\nas was well known; and confessed that the picture was that of the\r\nChevalier St. George.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that Mr. Simon, waiting upon Lord Castlewood one day\r\nat Monsieur Rigaud's whilst his lordship was sitting for his picture,\r\naffected to be much struck with a piece representing the Chevalier,\r\nwhereof the head only was finished, and purchased it of the painter\r\nfor a hundred crowns. It had been intended, the artist said, for Miss\r\nOglethorpe, the Prince's mistress, but that young lady quitting Paris,\r\nhad left the work on the artist's hands; and taking this piece home,\r\nwhen my lord's portrait arrived, Colonel Esmond, alias Monsieur Simon,\r\nhad copied the uniform and other accessories from my lord's picture to\r\nfill up Rigaud's incomplete canvas: the Colonel all his life having been\r\na practitioner of painting, and especially followed it during his long\r\nresidence in the cities of Flanders, among the masterpieces of Van Dyck\r\nand Rubens. My grandson hath the piece, such as it is, in Virginia now.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the month of June, Miss Beatrix Esmond, and my\r\nLady Viscountess, her mother, arrived from Castlewood; the former to\r\nresume her services at Court, which had been interrupted by the fatal\r\ncatastrophe of Duke Hamilton's death. She once more took her place,\r\nthen, in her Majesty's suite and at the Maids' table, being always a\r\nfavorite with Mrs. Masham, the Queen's chief woman, partly perhaps on\r\naccount of their bitterness against the Duchess of Marlborough, whom\r\nMiss Beatrix loved no better than her rival did. The gentlemen about the\r\nCourt, my Lord Bolingbroke amongst others, owned that the young lady had\r\ncome back handsomer than ever, and that the serious and tragic air which\r\nher face now involuntarily wore became her better than her former smiles\r\nand archness.\r\n\r\nAll the old domestics at the little house of Kensington Square were\r\nchanged; the old steward that had served the family any time these\r\nfive-and-twenty years, since the birth of the children of the house, was\r\ndespatched into the kingdom of Ireland to see my lord's estate there:\r\nthe housekeeper, who had been my lady's woman time out of mind, and the\r\nattendant of the young children, was sent away grumbling to Walcote,\r\nto see to the new painting and preparing of that house, which my Lady\r\nDowager intended to occupy for the future, giving up Castlewood to\r\nher daughter-in-law that might be expected daily from France. Another\r\nservant the Viscountess had was dismissed too--with a gratuity--on the\r\npretext that her ladyship's train of domestics must be diminished; so,\r\nfinally, there was not left in the household a single person who had\r\nbelonged to it during the time my young Lord Castlewood was yet at home.\r\n\r\nFor the plan which Colonel Esmond had in view, and the stroke he\r\nintended, 'twas necessary that the very smallest number of persons\r\nshould be put in possession of his secret. It scarce was known, except\r\nto three or four out of his family, and it was kept to a wonder.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June, 1714, there came by Mr. Prior's messenger from\r\nParis a letter from my Lord Viscount Castlewood to his mother, saying\r\nthat he had been foolish in regard of money matters, that he was ashamed\r\nto own he had lost at play, and by other extravagances; and that instead\r\nof having great entertainments as he had hoped at Castlewood this year,\r\nhe must live as quiet as he could, and make every effort to be saving.\r\nSo far every word of poor Frank's letter was true, nor was there a doubt\r\nthat he and his tall brothers-in-law had spent a great deal more than\r\nthey ought, and engaged the revenues of the Castlewood property, which\r\nthe fond mother had husbanded and improved so carefully during the time\r\nof her guardianship.\r\n\r\nHis \xe2\x80\x9cClotilda,\xe2\x80\x9d Castlewood went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cwas still delicate, and her\r\nphysicians thought her lying-in had best take place at Paris. He should\r\ncome without her ladyship, and be at his mother's house about the 17th\r\nor 18th day of June, proposing to take horse from Paris immediately,\r\nand bringing but a single servant with him; and he requested that the\r\nlawyers of Gray's inn might be invited to meet him with their account,\r\nand the land-steward come from Castlewood with his, so that he might\r\nsettle with them speedily, raise a sum of money whereof he stood in\r\nneed, and be back to his viscountess by the time of her lying-in.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nhis lordship gave some of the news of the town, sent his remembrance to\r\nkinsfolk, and so the letter ended. 'Twas put in the common post, and no\r\ndoubt the French police and the English there had a copy of it, to which\r\nthey were exceeding welcome.\r\n\r\nTwo days after another letter was despatched by the public post of\r\nFrance, in the same open way, and this, after giving news of the fashion\r\nat Court there, ended by the following sentences, in which, but for\r\nthose that had the key, 'twould be difficult for any man to find any\r\nsecret lurked at all:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c(The King will take) medicine on Thursday. His Majesty is better than\r\nhe hath been of late, though incommoded by indigestion from his too\r\ngreat appetite. Madame Maintenon continues well. They have performed a\r\nplay of Mons. Racine at St. Cyr. The Duke of Shrewsbury and Mr. Prior,\r\nour envoy, and all the English nobility here were present at it. (The\r\nViscount Castlewood's passports) were refused to him, 'twas said; his\r\nlordship being sued by a goldsmith for Vaisselle plate, and a pearl\r\nnecklace supplied to Mademoiselle Meruel of the French Comedy. 'Tis a\r\npity such news should get abroad (and travel to England) about our young\r\nnobility here. Mademoiselle Meruel has been sent to the Fort l'Evesque;\r\nthey say she has ordered not only plate, but furniture, and a chariot\r\nand horses (under that lord's name), of which extravagance his\r\nunfortunate Viscountess knows nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c(His Majesty will be) eighty-two years of age on his next birthday. The\r\nCourt prepares to celebrate it with a great feast. Mr. Prior is in a sad\r\nway about their refusing at home to send him his plate. All here admired\r\nmy Lord Viscount's portrait, and said it was a masterpiece of Rigaud.\r\nHave you seen it? It is (at the Lady Castlewood's house in Kensington\r\nSquare). I think no English painter could produce such a piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur poor friend the Abbe hath been at the Bastile, but is now\r\ntransported to the Conciergerie (where his friends may visit him. They\r\nare to ask for) a remission of his sentence soon. Let us hope the poor\r\nrogue will have repented in prison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c(The Lord Castlewood) has had the affair of the plate made up, and\r\ndeparts for England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not this a dull letter? I have a cursed headache with drinking with\r\nMat and some more over-night, and tipsy or sober am\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThine ever ----.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this letter, save some dozen of words which I have put above between\r\nbrackets, was mere idle talk, though the substance of the letter was as\r\nimportant as any letter well could be. It told those that had the key,\r\nthat The King will take the Viscount Castlewood's passports and travel\r\nto England under that lord's name. His Majesty will be at the Lady\r\nCastlewood's house in Kensington Square, where his friends may visit\r\nhim; they are to ask for the Lord Castlewood. This note may have passed\r\nunder Mr. Prior's eyes, and those of our new allies the French, and\r\ntaught them nothing; though it explains sufficiently to persons in\r\nLondon what the event was which was about to happen, as 'twill show\r\nthose who read my memoirs a hundred years hence, what was that errand on\r\nwhich Colonel Esmond of late had been busy. Silently and swiftly to do\r\nthat about which others were conspiring, and thousands of Jacobites\r\nall over the country clumsily caballing; alone to effect that which the\r\nleaders here were only talking about; to bring the Prince of Wales into\r\nthe country openly in the face of all, under Bolingbroke's very eyes,\r\nthe walls placarded with the proclamation signed with the Secretary's\r\nname, and offering five hundred pounds reward for his apprehension:\r\nthis was a stroke, the playing and winning of which might well give any\r\nadventurous spirit pleasure: the loss of the stake might involve a heavy\r\npenalty, but all our family were eager to risk that for the glorious\r\nchance of winning the game.\r\n\r\nNor shall it be called a game, save perhaps with the chief player, who\r\nwas not more or less sceptical than most public men with whom he had\r\nacquaintance in that age. (Is there ever a public man in England that\r\naltogether believes in his party? Is there one, however doubtful, that\r\nwill not fight for it?) Young Frank was ready to fight without much\r\nthinking, he was a Jacobite as his father before him was; all the\r\nEsmonds were Royalists. Give him but the word, he would cry, \xe2\x80\x9cGod save\r\nKing James!\xe2\x80\x9d before the palace guard, or at the Maypole in the Strand;\r\nand with respect to the women, as is usual with them, 'twas not a\r\nquestion of party but of faith; their belief was a passion; either\r\nEsmond's mistress or her daughter would have died for it cheerfully. I\r\nhave laughed often, talking of King William's reign, and said I thought\r\nLady Castlewood was disappointed the King did not persecute the family\r\nmore; and those who know the nature of women may fancy for themselves,\r\nwhat needs not here be written down, the rapture with which these\r\nneophytes received the mystery when made known to them; the eagerness\r\nwith which they looked forward to its completion; the reverence which\r\nthey paid the minister who initiated them into that secret Truth, now\r\nknown only to a few, but presently to reign over the world. Sure there\r\nis no bound to the trustingness of women. Look at Arria worshipping the\r\ndrunken clodpate of a husband who beats her; look at Cornelia treasuring\r\nas a jewel in her maternal heart the oaf her son; I have known a woman\r\npreach Jesuit's bark, and afterwards Dr. Berkeley's tar-water, as though\r\nto swallow them were a divine decree, and to refuse them no better than\r\nblasphemy.\r\n\r\nOn his return from France Colonel Esmond put himself at the head of\r\nthis little knot of fond conspirators. No death or torture he knew would\r\nfrighten them out of their constancy. When he detailed his plan for\r\nbringing the King back, his elder mistress thought that that Restoration\r\nwas to be attributed under heaven to the Castlewood family and to its\r\nchief, and she worshipped and loved Esmond, if that could be, more than\r\never she had done. She doubted not for one moment of the success of his\r\nscheme, to mistrust which would have seemed impious in her eyes. And as\r\nfor Beatrix, when she became acquainted with the plan, and joined it, as\r\nshe did with all her heart, she gave Esmond one of her searching bright\r\nlooks. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy were you not the head of our house?\r\nYou are the only one fit to raise it; why do you give that silly boy the\r\nname and the honor? But 'tis so in the world; those get the prize that\r\ndon't deserve or care for it. I wish I could give you YOUR silly prize,\r\ncousin, but I can't; I have tried, and I can't.\xe2\x80\x9d And she went away,\r\nshaking her head mournfully, but always, it seemed to Esmond, that her\r\nliking and respect for him was greatly increased, since she knew what\r\ncapability he had both to act and bear; to do and to forego.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL OF THE PORTRAIT COMES TO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Twas announced in the family that my Lord Castlewood would arrive,\r\nhaving a confidential French gentleman in his suite, who acted as\r\nsecretary to his lordship, and who, being a Papist, and a foreigner of\r\na good family, though now in rather a menial place, would have his meals\r\nserved in his chamber, and not with the domestics of the house. The\r\nViscountess gave up her bedchamber contiguous to her daughter's, and\r\nhaving a large convenient closet attached to it, in which a bed was\r\nput up, ostensibly for Monsieur Baptiste, the Frenchman; though, 'tis\r\nneedless to say, when the doors of the apartments were locked, and the\r\ntwo guests retired within it, the young viscount became the servant of\r\nthe illustrious Prince whom he entertained, and gave up gladly the more\r\nconvenient and airy chamber and bed to his master. Madam Beatrix\r\nalso retired to the upper region, her chamber being converted into\r\na sitting-room for my lord. The better to carry the deceit, Beatrix\r\naffected to grumble before the servants, and to be jealous that she was\r\nturned out of her chamber to make way for my lord.\r\n\r\nNo small preparations were made, you may be sure, and no slight tremor\r\nof expectation caused the hearts of the gentle ladies of Castlewood to\r\nflutter, before the arrival of the personages who were about to honor\r\ntheir house. The chamber was ornamented with flowers; the bed covered\r\nwith the very finest of linen; the two ladies insisting on making it\r\nthemselves, and kneeling down at the bedside and kissing the sheets out\r\nof respect for the web that was to hold the sacred person of a King. The\r\ntoilet was of silver and crystal; there was a copy of \xe2\x80\x9cEikon Basilike\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n laid on the writing-table; a portrait of the martyred King hung always\r\nover the mantel, having a sword of my poor Lord Castlewood underneath\r\nit, and a little picture or emblem which the widow loved always to have\r\nbefore her eyes on waking, and in which the hair of her lord and her two\r\nchildren was worked together. Her books of private devotions, as they\r\nwere all of the English Church, she carried away with her to the upper\r\napartment, which she destined for herself. The ladies showed Mr. Esmond,\r\nwhen they were completed, the fond preparations they had made. 'Twas\r\nthen Beatrix knelt down and kissed the linen sheets. As for her mother,\r\nLady Castlewood made a curtsy at the door, as she would have done to the\r\naltar on entering a church, and owned that she considered the chamber in\r\na manner sacred.\r\n\r\nThe company in the servants' hall never for a moment supposed that these\r\npreparations were made for any other person than the young viscount,\r\nthe lord of the house, whom his fond mother had been for so many years\r\nwithout seeing. Both ladies were perfect housewives, having the greatest\r\nskill in the making of confections, scented waters, &c., and keeping a\r\nnotable superintendence over the kitchen. Calves enough were killed to\r\nfeed an army of prodigal sons, Esmond thought, and laughed when he came\r\nto wait on the ladies, on the day when the guests were to arrive, to\r\nfind two pairs of the finest and roundest arms to be seen in England (my\r\nLady Castlewood was remarkable for this beauty of her person), covered\r\nwith flour up above the elbows, and preparing paste, and turning\r\nrolling-pins in the housekeeper's closet. The guest would not arrive\r\ntill supper-time, and my lord would prefer having that meal in his own\r\nchamber. You may be sure the brightest plate of the house was laid out\r\nthere, and can understand why it was that the ladies insisted that they\r\nalone would wait upon the young chief of the family.\r\n\r\nTaking horse, Colonel Esmond rode rapidly to Rochester, and there\r\nawaited the King in that very town where his father had last set his\r\nfoot on the English shore. A room had been provided at an inn there for\r\nmy Lord Castlewood and his servant; and Colonel Esmond timed his ride so\r\nwell that he had scarce been half an hour in the place, and was looking\r\nover the balcony into the yard of the inn, when two travellers rode in\r\nat the inn gate, and the Colonel running down, the next moment embraced\r\nhis dear young lord.\r\n\r\nMy lord's companion, acting the part of a domestic, dismounted, and was\r\nfor holding the viscount's stirrup; but Colonel Esmond, calling to his\r\nown man, who was in the court, bade him take the horses and settle with\r\nthe lad who had ridden the post along with the two travellers, crying\r\nout in a cavalier tone in the French language to my lord's companion,\r\nand affecting to grumble that my lord's fellow was a Frenchman, and did\r\nnot know the money or habits of the country:--\xe2\x80\x9cMy man will see to the\r\nhorses, Baptiste,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel Esmond: \xe2\x80\x9cdo you understand English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cVery leetle!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSo, follow my lord and wait upon him at dinner in his\r\nown room.\xe2\x80\x9d The landlord and his people came up presently bearing the\r\ndishes; 'twas well they made a noise and stir in the gallery, or they\r\nmight have found Colonel Esmond on his knee before Lord Castlewood's\r\nservant, welcoming his Majesty to his kingdom, and kissing the hand\r\nof the King. We told the landlord that the Frenchman would wait on\r\nhis master; and Esmond's man was ordered to keep sentry in the gallery\r\nwithout the door. The Prince dined with a good appetite, laughing and\r\ntalking very gayly, and condescendingly bidding his two companions\r\nto sit with him at table. He was in better spirits than poor Frank\r\nCastlewood, who Esmond thought might be woe-begone on account of parting\r\nwith his divine Clotilda; but the Prince wishing to take a short siesta\r\nafter dinner, and retiring to an inner chamber where there was a bed,\r\nthe cause of poor Frank's discomfiture came out; and bursting into\r\ntears, with many expressions of fondness, friendship, and humiliation,\r\nthe faithful lad gave his kinsman to understand that he now knew all the\r\ntruth, and the sacrifices which Colonel Esmond had made for him.\r\n\r\nSeeing no good in acquainting poor Frank with that secret, Mr. Esmond\r\nhad entreated his mistress also not to reveal it to her son. The Prince\r\nhad told the poor lad all as they were riding from Dover: \xe2\x80\x9cI had as lief\r\nhe had shot me, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank said: \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you were the best, and the\r\nbravest, and the kindest of all men\xe2\x80\x9d (so the enthusiastic young fellow\r\nwent on); \xe2\x80\x9cbut I never thought I owed you what I do, and can scarce bear\r\nthe weight of the obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stand in the place of your father,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nsure a father may dispossess himself in favor of his son. I abdicate the\r\ntwopenny crown, and invest you with the kingdom of Brentford; don't be a\r\nfool and cry; you make a much taller and handsomer viscount than ever\r\nI could.\xe2\x80\x9d But the fond boy, with oaths and protestations, laughter and\r\nincoherent outbreaks of passionate emotion, could not be got, for some\r\nlittle time, to put up with Esmond's raillery; wanted to kneel down to\r\nhim, and kissed his hand; asked him and implored him to order something,\r\nto bid Castlewood give his own life or take somebody else's; anything,\r\nso that he might show his gratitude for the generosity Esmond showed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe K---, HE laughed,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank said, pointing to the door where the\r\nsleeper was, and speaking in a low tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI don't think he should have\r\nlaughed as he told me the story. As we rode along from Dover, talking in\r\nFrench, he spoke about you, and your coming to him at Bar; he called\r\nyou 'le grand serieux,' Don Bellianis of Greece, and I don't know what\r\nnames; mimicking your manner\xe2\x80\x9d (here Castlewood laughed himself)--\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhe did it very well. He seems to sneer at everything. He is not like a\r\nking: somehow Harry, I fancy you are like a king. He does not seem\r\nto think what a stake we are all playing. He would have stopped at\r\nCanterbury to run after a barmaid there, had I not implored him to come\r\non. He hath a house at Chaillot, where he used to go and bury himself\r\nfor weeks away from the Queen, and with all sorts of bad company,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nFrank, with a demure look; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may smile, but I am not the wild fellow\r\nI was; no, no, I have been taught better,\xe2\x80\x9d says Castlewood devoutly,\r\nmaking a sign on his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art my dear brave boy,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel Esmond, touched at the young\r\nfellow's simplicity, \xe2\x80\x9cand there will be a noble gentleman at Castlewood\r\nso long as my Frank is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impetuous young lad was for going down on his knees again, with\r\nanother explosion of gratitude, but that we heard the voice from the\r\nnext chamber of the august sleeper, just waking, calling out:--\xe2\x80\x9cEh,\r\nLa-Fleur, un verre d'eau!\xe2\x80\x9d His Majesty came out yawning:--\xe2\x80\x9cA pest,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cupon your English ale, 'tis so strong that, ma foi, it hath turned\r\nmy head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effect of the ale was like a spur upon our horses, and we rode\r\nvery quickly to London, reaching Kensington at nightfall. Mr. Esmond's\r\nservant was left behind at Rochester, to take care of the tired horses,\r\nwhilst we had fresh beasts provided along the road. And galloping by\r\nthe Prince's side the Colonel explained to the Prince of Wales what his\r\nmovements had been; who the friends were that knew of the expedition;\r\nwhom, as Esmond conceived, the Prince should trust; entreating him,\r\nabove all, to maintain the very closest secrecy until the time should\r\ncome when his Royal Highness should appear. The town swarmed with\r\nfriends of the Prince's cause; there were scores of correspondents with\r\nSt. Germains; Jacobites known and secret; great in station and humble;\r\nabout the Court and the Queen; in the Parliament, Church, and among the\r\nmerchants in the City. The Prince had friends numberless in the army,\r\nin the Privy Council, and the Officers of State. The great object, as it\r\nseemed, to the small band of persons who had concerted that bold stroke,\r\nwho had brought the Queen's brother into his native country, was, that\r\nhis visit should remain unknown till the proper time came, when his\r\npresence should surprise friends and enemies alike; and the latter\r\nshould be found so unprepared and disunited, that they should not\r\nfind time to attack him. We feared more from his friends than from his\r\nenemies. The lies and tittle-tattle sent over to St. Germains by the\r\nJacobite agents about London, had done an incalculable mischief to his\r\ncause, and wofully misguided him, and it was from these especially, that\r\nthe persons engaged in the present venture were anxious to defend the\r\nchief actor in it.*\r\n\r\n     * The managers were the Bishop, who cannot be hurt by having\r\n     his name mentioned, a very active and loyal Nonconformist\r\n     Divine, a lady in the highest favor at Court, with whom\r\n     Beatrix Esmond had communication, and two noblemen of the\r\n     greatest rank, and a member of the House of Commons, who was\r\n     implicated in more transactions than one in behalf of the\r\n     Stuart family.\r\n\r\nThe party reached London by nightfall, leaving their horses at the\r\nPosting-House over against Westminster, and being ferried over the\r\nwater, where Lady Esmond's coach was already in waiting. In another hour\r\nwe were all landed at Kensington, and the mistress of the house had that\r\nsatisfaction which her heart had yearned after for many years, once more\r\nto embrace her son, who, on his side, with all his waywardness, ever\r\nretained a most tender affection for his parent.\r\n\r\nShe did not refrain from this expression of her feeling, though the\r\ndomestics were by, and my Lord Castlewood's attendant stood in the hall.\r\nEsmond had to whisper to him in French to take his hat off. Monsieur\r\nBaptiste was constantly neglecting his part with an inconceivable\r\nlevity: more than once on the ride to London, little observations of the\r\nstranger, light remarks, and words betokening the greatest ignorance of\r\nthe country the Prince came to govern, had hurt the susceptibility of\r\nthe two gentlemen forming his escort; nor could either help owning in\r\nhis secret mind that they would have had his behavior otherwise,\r\nand that the laughter and the lightness, not to say license, which\r\ncharacterized his talk, scarce befitted such a great Prince, and such a\r\nsolemn occasion. Not but that he could act at proper times with spirit\r\nand dignity. He had behaved, as we all knew, in a very courageous manner\r\non the field. Esmond had seen a copy of the letter the Prince had writ\r\nwith his own hand when urged by his friends in England to abjure his\r\nreligion, and admired that manly and magnanimous reply by which he\r\nrefused to yield to the temptation. Monsieur Baptiste took off his\r\nhat, blushing at the hint Colonel Esmond ventured to give him, and\r\nsaid:--\xe2\x80\x9cTenez, elle est jolie, la petite mere. Foi de Chevalier! elle\r\nest charmante; mais l'autre, qui est cette nymphe, cet astre qui brille,\r\ncette Diane qui descend sur nous?\xe2\x80\x9d And he started back, and pushed\r\nforward, as Beatrix was descending the stair. She was in colors for the\r\nfirst time at her own house; she wore the diamonds Esmond gave her; it\r\nhad been agreed between them, that she should wear these brilliants on\r\nthe day when the King should enter the house, and a Queen she looked,\r\nradiant in charms, and magnificent and imperial in beauty.\r\n\r\nCastlewood himself was startled by that beauty and splendor; he stepped\r\nback and gazed at his sister as though he had not been aware before (nor\r\nwas he very likely) how perfectly lovely she was, and I thought blushed\r\nas he embraced her. The Prince could not keep his eyes off her; he quite\r\nforgot his menial part, though he had been schooled to it, and a little\r\nlight portmanteau prepared expressly that he should carry it. He pressed\r\nforward before my Lord Viscount. 'Twas lucky the servants' eyes were\r\nbusy in other directions, or they must have seen that this was no\r\nservant, or at least a very insolent and rude one.\r\n\r\nAgain Colonel Esmond was obliged to cry out, \xe2\x80\x9cBaptiste,\xe2\x80\x9d in a loud\r\nimperious voice, \xe2\x80\x9chave a care to the valise;\xe2\x80\x9d at which hint the wilful\r\nyoung man ground his teeth together with something very like a curse\r\nbetween them, and then gave a brief look of anything but pleasure to his\r\nMentor. Being reminded, however, he shouldered the little portmanteau,\r\nand carried it up the stair, Esmond preceding him, and a servant with\r\nlighted tapers. He flung down his burden sulkily in the bedchamber:--\xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nPrince that will wear a crown must wear a mask,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond in\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh peste! I see how it is,\xe2\x80\x9d says Monsieur Baptiste, continuing the\r\ntalk in French. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Serious is seriously\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9calarmed for Monsieur\r\nBaptiste,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in the Colonel. Esmond neither liked the tone with\r\nwhich the Prince spoke of the ladies, nor the eyes with which he\r\nregarded them.\r\n\r\nThe bedchamber and the two rooms adjoining it, the closet and the\r\napartment which was to be called my lord's parlor, were already lighted\r\nand awaiting their occupier; and the collation laid for my lord's\r\nsupper. Lord Castlewood and his mother and sister came up the stair\r\na minute afterwards, and, so soon as the domestics had quitted the\r\napartment, Castlewood and Esmond uncovered, and the two ladies went down\r\non their knees before the Prince, who graciously gave a hand to each.\r\nHe looked his part of Prince much more naturally than that of servant,\r\nwhich he had just been trying, and raised them both with a great deal of\r\nnobility, as well as kindness in his air. \xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother\r\nwill thank your ladyship for your hospitality to her son; for you,\r\nmadam,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to Beatrix, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot bear to see so much beauty in such\r\na posture. You will betray Monsieur Baptiste if you kneel to him; sure\r\n'tis his place rather to kneel to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA light shone out of her eyes; a gleam bright enough to kindle passion\r\nin any breast. There were times when this creature was so handsome,\r\nthat she seemed, as it were, like Venus revealing herself a goddess in a\r\nflash of brightness. She appeared so now; radiant, and with eyes bright\r\nwith a wonderful lustre. A pang, as of rage and jealousy, shot through\r\nEsmond's heart, as he caught the look she gave the Prince; and he\r\nclenched his hand involuntarily and looked across to Castlewood, whose\r\neyes answered his alarm-signal, and were also on the alert. The Prince\r\ngave his subjects an audience of a few minutes, and then the two ladies\r\nand Colonel Esmond quitted the chamber. Lady Castlewood pressed his hand\r\nas they descended the stair, and the three went down to the lower rooms,\r\nwhere they waited awhile till the travellers above should be refreshed\r\nand ready for their meal.\r\n\r\nEsmond looked at Beatrix, blazing with her jewels on her beautiful neck.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have kept my word,\xe2\x80\x9d says he: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I mine,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, looking down\r\non the diamonds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere I the Mogul Emperor,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cyou should have all that\r\nwere dug out of Golconda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are a great deal too good for me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, dropping her\r\nhead on her beautiful breast,--\xe2\x80\x9cso are you all, all!\xe2\x80\x9d And when she\r\nlooked up again, as she did in a moment, and after a sigh, her eyes,\r\nas they gazed at her cousin, wore that melancholy and inscrutable look\r\nwhich 'twas always impossible to sound.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the supper, of which we were advertised by a\r\nknocking overhead, Colonel Esmond and the two ladies went to the upper\r\napartment, where the Prince already was, and by his side the young\r\nViscount, of exactly the same age, shape, and with features not\r\ndissimilar, though Frank's were the handsomer of the two. The Prince\r\nsat down and bade the ladies sit. The gentlemen remained standing: there\r\nwas, indeed, but one more cover laid at the table:--\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of you will\r\ntake it?\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe head of our house,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lady Castlewood, taking her son's hand,\r\nand looking towards Colonel Esmond with a bow and a great tremor of the\r\nvoice; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Marquis of Esmond will have the honor of serving the King.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have the honor of waiting on his Royal Highness,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel\r\nEsmond, filling a cup of wine, and, as the fashion of that day was, he\r\npresented it to the King on his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drink to my hostess and her family,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince, with no very\r\nwell-pleased air; but the cloud passed immediately off his face, and he\r\ntalked to the ladies in a lively, rattling strain, quite undisturbed\r\nby poor Mr. Esmond's yellow countenance, that, I dare say, looked very\r\nglum.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came to take leave, Esmond marched homewards to his\r\nlodgings, and met Mr. Addison on the road that night, walking to a\r\ncottage he had at Fulham, the moon shining on his handsome serene\r\nface:--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cheer, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d says Addison, laughing: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was\r\na footpad advancing in the dark, and behold 'tis an old friend. We\r\nmay shake hands, Colonel, in the dark, 'tis better than fighting by\r\ndaylight. Why should we quarrel, because I am a Whig and thou art\r\na Tory? Turn thy steps and walk with me to Fulham, where there is a\r\nnightingale still singing in the garden, and a cool bottle in a cave I\r\nknow of; you shall drink to the Pretender if you like, and I will drink\r\nmy liquor my own way: I have had enough of good liquor?--no, never!\r\nThere is no such word as enough as a stopper for good wine. Thou wilt\r\nnot come? Come any day, come soon. You know I remember Simois and the\r\nSigeia tellus, and the praelia mixta mero, mixta mero,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated,\r\nwith ever so slight a touch of merum in his voice, and walked back a\r\nlittle way on the road with Esmond, bidding the other remember he was\r\nalways his friend, and indebted to him for his aid in the \xe2\x80\x9cCampaign\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n poem. And very likely Mr. Under-Secretary would have stepped in and\r\ntaken t'other bottle at the Colonel's lodging, had the latter invited\r\nhim, but Esmond's mood was none of the gayest, and he bade his friend an\r\ninhospitable good-night at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done the deed,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, sleepless, and looking out into the\r\nnight; \xe2\x80\x9che is here, and I have brought him; he and Beatrix are sleeping\r\nunder the same roof now. Whom did I mean to serve in bringing him? Was\r\nit the Prince? was it Henry Esmond? Had I not best have joined the manly\r\ncreed of Addison yonder, that scouts the old doctrine of right\r\ndivine, that boldly declares that Parliament and people consecrate the\r\nSovereign, not bishops, nor genealogies, nor oils, nor coronations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The eager gaze of the young Prince, watching every movement of Beatrix,\r\nhaunted Esmond and pursued him. The Prince's figure appeared before him\r\nin his feverish dreams many times that night. He wished the deed undone\r\nfor which he had labored so. He was not the first that has regretted his\r\nown act, or brought about his own undoing. Undoing? Should he write\r\nthat word in his late years? No, on his knees before heaven, rather be\r\nthankful for what then he deemed his misfortune, and which hath caused\r\nthe whole subsequent happiness of his life.\r\n\r\nEsmond's man, honest John Lockwood, had served his master and the family\r\nall his life, and the Colonel knew that he could answer for John's\r\nfidelity as for his own. John returned with the horses from Rochester\r\nbetimes the next morning, and the Colonel gave him to understand that on\r\ngoing to Kensington, where he was free of the servants' hall, and indeed\r\ncourting Miss Beatrix's maid, he was to ask no questions, and betray no\r\nsurprise, but to vouch stoutly that the young gentleman he should see in\r\na red coat there was my Lord Viscount Castlewood, and that his attendant\r\nin gray was Monsieur Baptiste the Frenchman. He was to tell his friends\r\nin the kitchen such stories as he remembered of my Lord Viscount's youth\r\nat Castlewood; what a wild boy he was; how he used to drill Jack and\r\ncane him, before ever he was a soldier; everything, in fine, he knew\r\nrespecting my Lord Viscount's early days. Jack's ideas of painting\r\nhad not been much cultivated during his residence in Flanders with his\r\nmaster; and, before my young lord's return, he had been easily got to\r\nbelieve that the picture brought over from Paris, and now hanging in\r\nLady Castlewood's drawing-room, was a perfect likeness of her son, the\r\nyoung lord. And the domestics having all seen the picture many times,\r\nand catching but a momentary imperfect glimpse of the two strangers on\r\nthe night of their arrival, never had a reason to doubt the fidelity\r\nof the portrait; and next day, when they saw the original of the piece\r\nhabited exactly as he was represented in the painting, with the same\r\nperiwig, ribbons, and uniform of the Guard, quite naturally addressed\r\nthe gentleman as my Lord Castlewood, my Lady Viscountess's son.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the night previous was now the viscount; the viscount\r\nwore the secretary's gray frock; and John Lockwood was instructed to\r\nhint to the world below stairs that my lord being a Papist, and very\r\ndevout in that religion, his attendant might be no other than his\r\nchaplain from Bruxelles; hence, if he took his meals in my lord's\r\ncompany there was little reason for surprise. Frank was further\r\ncautioned to speak English with a foreign accent, which task he\r\nperformed indifferently well, and this caution was the more necessary\r\nbecause the Prince himself scarce spoke our language like a native of\r\nthe island: and John Lockwood laughed with the folks below stairs at the\r\nmanner in which my lord, after five years abroad, sometimes forgot his\r\nown tongue, and spoke it like a Frenchman. \xe2\x80\x9cI warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat,\r\nwith the English beef and beer, his lordship will soon get back the\r\nproper use of his mouth;\xe2\x80\x9d and, to do his new lordship justice, he took\r\nto beer and beef very kindly.\r\n\r\nThe Prince drank so much, and was so loud and imprudent in his talk\r\nafter his drink, that Esmond often trembled for him. His meals were\r\nserved as much as possible in his own chamber, though frequently he made\r\nhis appearance in Lady Castlewood's parlor and drawing-room, calling\r\nBeatrix \xe2\x80\x9csister,\xe2\x80\x9d and her ladyship \xe2\x80\x9cmother,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmadam\xe2\x80\x9d before the\r\nservants. And, choosing to act entirely up to the part of brother and\r\nson, the Prince sometimes saluted Mrs. Beatrix and Lady Castlewood with\r\na freedom which his secretary did not like, and which, for his part, set\r\nColonel Esmond tearing with rage.\r\n\r\nThe guests had not been three days in the house when poor Jack Lockwood\r\ncame with a rueful countenance to his master, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord--that\r\nis the gentleman--has been tampering with Mrs. Lucy (Jack's sweetheart),\r\nand given her guineas and a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d I fear that Colonel Esmond's mind was\r\nrather relieved than otherwise when he found that the ancillary beauty\r\nwas the one whom the Prince had selected. His royal tastes were known\r\nto lie that way, and continued so in after life. The heir of one of\r\nthe greatest names, of the greatest kingdoms, and of the greatest\r\nmisfortunes in Europe, was often content to lay the dignity of his birth\r\nand grief at the wooden shoes of a French chambermaid, and to repent\r\nafterwards (for he was very devout) in ashes taken from the dust-pan.\r\n'Tis for mortals such as these that nations suffer, that parties\r\nstruggle, that warriors fight and bleed. A year afterwards gallant heads\r\nwere falling, and Nithsdale in escape, and Derwentwater on the scaffold;\r\nwhilst the heedless ingrate, for whom they risked and lost all, was\r\ntippling with his seraglio of mistresses in his petite maison of\r\nChaillot.\r\n\r\nBlushing to be forced to bear such an errand, Esmond had to go to the\r\nPrince and warn him that the girl whom his Highness was bribing was John\r\nLockwood's sweetheart, an honest resolute man, who had served in six\r\ncampaigns, and feared nothing, and who knew that the person calling\r\nhimself Lord Castlewood was not his young master: and the Colonel\r\nbesought the Prince to consider what the effect of a single man's\r\njealousy might be, and to think of other designs he had in hand, more\r\nimportant than the seduction of a waiting-maid, and the humiliation of a\r\nbrave man.\r\n\r\nTen times, perhaps, in the course of as many days, Mr. Esmond had to\r\nwarn the royal young adventurer of some imprudence or some freedom. He\r\nreceived these remonstrances very testily, save perhaps in this affair\r\nof poor Lockwood's, when he deigned to burst out a-laughing, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the soubrette has peached to the amoureux, and Crispin is angry,\r\nand Crispin has served, and Crispin has been a corporal, has he? Tell\r\nhim we will reward his valor with a pair of colors, and recompense his\r\nfidelity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColonel Esmond ventured to utter some other words of entreaty, but the\r\nPrince, stamping imperiously, cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cAssez, milord: je m'ennuye\r\na la preche; I am not come to London to go to the sermon.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\ncomplained afterwards to Castlewood, that \xe2\x80\x9cle petit jaune, le noir\r\nColonel, le Marquis Misanthrope\xe2\x80\x9d (by which facetious names his Royal\r\nHighness was pleased to designate Colonel Esmond), \xe2\x80\x9cfatigued him with\r\nhis grand airs and virtuous homilies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Rochester, and other gentlemen engaged in the transaction\r\nwhich had brought the Prince over, waited upon his Royal Highness,\r\nconstantly asking for my Lord Castlewood on their arrival at Kensington,\r\nand being openly conducted to his Royal Highness in that character, who\r\nreceived them either in my lady's drawing-room below, or above in his\r\nown apartment; and all implored him to quit the house as little as\r\npossible, and to wait there till the signal should be given for him to\r\nappear. The ladies entertained him at cards, over which amusement he\r\nspent many hours in each day and night. He passed many hours more in\r\ndrinking, during which time he would rattle and talk very agreeably, and\r\nespecially if the Colonel was absent, whose presence always seemed to\r\nfrighten him; and the poor \xe2\x80\x9cColonel Noir\xe2\x80\x9d took that hint as a command\r\naccordingly, and seldom intruded his black face upon the convivial hours\r\nof this august young prisoner. Except for those few persons of whom the\r\nporter had the list, Lord Castlewood was denied to all friends of the\r\nhouse who waited on his lordship. The wound he had received had broke\r\nout again from his journey on horseback, so the world and the domestics\r\nwere informed. And Doctor A----,* his physician (I shall not mention his\r\nname, but he was physician to the Queen, of the Scots nation, and a man\r\nremarkable for his benevolence as well as his wit), gave orders that he\r\nshould be kept perfectly quiet until the wound should heal. With this\r\ngentleman, who was one of the most active and influential of our party,\r\nand the others before spoken of, the whole secret lay; and it was kept\r\nwith so much faithfulness, and the story we told so simple and natural,\r\nthat there was no likelihood of a discovery except from the imprudence\r\nof the Prince himself, and an adventurous levity that we had the\r\ngreatest difficulty to control. As for Lady Castlewood, although she\r\nscarce spoke a word, 'twas easy to gather from her demeanor, and one\r\nor two hints she dropped, how deep her mortification was at finding the\r\nhero whom she had chosen to worship all her life (and whose restoration\r\nhad formed almost the most sacred part of her prayers), no more than\r\na man, and not a good one. She thought misfortune might have chastened\r\nhim; but that instructress had rather rendered him callous than humble.\r\nHis devotion, which was quite real, kept him from no sin he had a mind\r\nto. His talk showed good-humor, gayety, even wit enough; but there was\r\na levity in his acts and words that he had brought from among those\r\nlibertine devotees with whom he had been bred, and that shocked the\r\nsimplicity and purity of the English lady, whose guest he was. Esmond\r\nspoke his mind to Beatrix pretty freely about the Prince, getting her\r\nbrother to put in a word of warning. Beatrix was entirely of their\r\nopinion; she thought he was very light, very light and reckless; she\r\ncould not even see the good looks Colonel Esmond had spoken of. The\r\nPrince had bad teeth, and a decided squint. How could we say he did not\r\nsquint? His eyes were fine, but there was certainly a cast in them. She\r\nrallied him at table with wonderful wit; she spoke of him invariably as\r\nof a mere boy; she was more fond of Esmond than ever, praised him to her\r\nbrother, praised him to the Prince, when his Royal Highness was pleased\r\nto sneer at the Colonel, and warmly espoused his cause: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if your\r\nMajesty does not give him the Garter his father had, when the Marquis\r\nof Esmond comes to your Majesty's court, I will hang myself in my own\r\ngarters, or will cry my eyes out.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cRather than lose those,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nPrince, \xe2\x80\x9che shall be made Archbishop and Colonel of the Guard\xe2\x80\x9d (it was\r\nFrank Castlewood who told me of this conversation over their supper).\r\n\r\n     * There can be very little doubt that the Doctor mentioned\r\n     by my dear father was the famous Dr. Arbuthnot.--R. E. W.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d cries she, with one of her laughs--I fancy I hear it now.\r\nThirty years afterwards I hear that delightful music. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he shall be\r\nArchbishop of Esmond and Marquis of Canterbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will your ladyship be?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have but to\r\nchoose your place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be mother of the maids to the Queen of his\r\nMajesty King James the Third--Vive le Roy!\xe2\x80\x9d and she made him a great\r\ncurtsy, and drank a part of a glass of wine in his honor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prince seized hold of the glass and drank the last drop of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Castlewood said, \xe2\x80\x9cand my mother, looking very anxious, rose up and asked\r\nleave to retire. But that Trix is my mother's daughter, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't know what a horrid fear I should have of her. I\r\nwish--I wish this business were over. You are older than I am,\r\nand wiser, and better, and I owe you everything, and would die for\r\nyou--before George I would; but I wish the end of this were come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither of us very likely passed a tranquil night; horrible doubts and\r\ntorments racked Esmond's soul: 'twas a scheme of personal ambition,\r\na daring stroke for a selfish end--he knew it. What cared he, in his\r\nheart, who was King? Were not his very sympathies and secret convictions\r\non the other side--on the side of People, Parliament, Freedom? And here\r\nwas he, engaged for a Prince that had scarce heard the word liberty;\r\nthat priests and women, tyrants by nature, both made a tool of. The\r\nmisanthrope was in no better humor after hearing that story, and his\r\ngrim face more black and yellow than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWE ENTERTAIN A VERY DISTINGUISHED GUEST AT KENSINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould any clue be found to the dark intrigues at the latter end of\r\nQueen Anne's time, or any historian be inclined to follow it, 'twill be\r\ndiscovered, I have little doubt, that not one of the great personages\r\nabout the Queen had a defined scheme of policy, independent of that\r\nprivate and selfish interest which each was bent on pursuing: St.\r\nJohn was for St. John, and Harley for Oxford, and Marlborough for\r\nJohn Churchill, always; and according as they could get help from\r\nSt. Germains or Hanover, they sent over proffers of allegiance to\r\nthe Princes there, or betrayed one to the other: one cause, or one\r\nsovereign, was as good as another to them, so that they could hold the\r\nbest place under him; and like Lockit and Peachem, the Newgate chiefs\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x9cRogues' Opera,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gay wrote afterwards, had each in his hand\r\ndocuments and proofs of treason which would hang the other, only he did\r\nnot dare to use the weapon, for fear of that one which his neighbor\r\nalso carried in his pocket. Think of the great Marlborough, the greatest\r\nsubject in all the world, a conqueror of princes, that had marched\r\nvictorious over Germany, Flanders, and France, that had given the law to\r\nsovereigns abroad, and been worshipped as a divinity at home, forced to\r\nsneak out of England--his credit, honors, places, all taken from him;\r\nhis friends in the army broke and ruined; and flying before Harley, as\r\nabject and powerless as a poor debtor before a bailiff with a writ. A\r\npaper, of which Harley got possession, and showing beyond doubt that the\r\nDuke was engaged with the Stuart family, was the weapon with which the\r\nTreasurer drove Marlborough out of the kingdom. He fled to Antwerp, and\r\nbegan intriguing instantly on the other side, and came back to England,\r\nas all know, a Whig and a Hanoverian.\r\n\r\nThough the Treasurer turned out of the army and office every man,\r\nmilitary or civil, known to be the Duke's friend, and gave the vacant\r\nposts among the Tory party; he, too, was playing the double game between\r\nHanover and St. Germains, awaiting the expected catastrophe of the\r\nQueen's death to be Master of the State, and offer it to either family\r\nthat should bribe him best, or that the nation should declare for.\r\nWhichever the King was, Harley's object was to reign over him; and to\r\nthis end he supplanted the former famous favorite, decried the actions\r\nof the war which had made Marlborough's name illustrious, and disdained\r\nno more than the great fallen competitor of his, the meanest arts,\r\nflatteries, intimidations, that would secure his power. If the greatest\r\nsatirist the world ever hath seen had writ against Harley, and not for\r\nhim, what a history had he left behind of the last years of Queen Anne's\r\nreign! But Swift, that scorned all mankind, and himself not the least of\r\nall, had this merit of a faithful partisan, that he loved those chiefs\r\nwho treated him well, and stuck by Harley bravely in his fall, as he\r\ngallantly had supported him in his better fortune.\r\n\r\nIncomparably more brilliant, more splendid, eloquent, accomplished than\r\nhis rival, the great St. John could be as selfish as Oxford was, and\r\ncould act the double part as skilfully as ambidextrous Churchill. He\r\nwhose talk was always of liberty, no more shrunk from using persecution\r\nand the pillory against his opponents than if he had been at Lisbon and\r\nGrand Inquisitor. This lofty patriot was on his knees at Hanover and St.\r\nGermains too; notoriously of no religion, he toasted Church and Queen\r\nas boldly as the stupid Sacheverel, whom he used and laughed at; and\r\nto serve his turn, and to overthrow his enemy, he could intrigue, coax,\r\nbully, wheedle, fawn on the Court favorite and creep up the back-stair\r\nas silently as Oxford, who supplanted Marlborough, and whom he himself\r\nsupplanted. The crash of my Lord Oxford happened at this very time\r\nwhereat my history is now arrived. He was come to the very last days of\r\nhis power, and the agent whom he employed to overthrow the conqueror of\r\nBlenheim, was now engaged to upset the conqueror's conqueror, and hand\r\nover the staff of government to Bolingbroke, who had been panting to\r\nhold it.\r\n\r\nIn expectation of the stroke that was now preparing, the Irish regiments\r\nin the French service were all brought round about Boulogne in Picardy,\r\nto pass over if need were with the Duke of Berwick; the soldiers of\r\nFrance no longer, but subjects of James the Third of England and Ireland\r\nKing. The fidelity of the great mass of the Scots (though a most active,\r\nresolute, and gallant Whig party, admirably and energetically ordered\r\nand disciplined, was known to be in Scotland too) was notoriously\r\nunshaken in their King. A very great body of Tory clergy, nobility, and\r\ngentry, were public partisans of the exiled Prince; and the indifferents\r\nmight be counted on to cry King George or King James, according as\r\neither should prevail. The Queen, especially in her latter days,\r\ninclined towards her own family. The Prince was lying actually in\r\nLondon, within a stone's cast of his sister's palace; the first Minister\r\ntoppling to his fall, and so tottering that the weakest push of\r\na woman's finger would send him down; and as for Bolingbroke, his\r\nsuccessor, we know on whose side his power and his splendid eloquence\r\nwould be on the day when the Queen should appear openly before her\r\nCouncil and say:--\xe2\x80\x9cThis, my lords, is my brother; here is my father's\r\nheir, and mine after me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the previous year the Queen had had many and\r\nrepeated fits of sickness, fever, and lethargy, and her death had been\r\nconstantly looked for by all her attendants. The Elector of Hanover had\r\nwished to send his son, the Duke of Cambridge--to pay his court to his\r\ncousin the Queen, the Elector said;--in truth, to be on the spot when\r\ndeath should close her career. Frightened perhaps to have such a memento\r\nmori under her royal eyes, her Majesty had angrily forbidden the young\r\nPrince's coming into England. Either she desired to keep the chances for\r\nher brother open yet; or the people about her did not wish to close with\r\nthe Whig candidate till they could make terms with him. The quarrels\r\nof her Ministers before her face at the Council board, the pricks of\r\nconscience very likely, the importunities of her Ministers, and constant\r\nturmoil and agitation round about her, had weakened and irritated the\r\nPrincess extremely; her strength was giving way under these continual\r\ntrials of her temper, and from day to day it was expected she must\r\ncome to a speedy end of them. Just before Viscount Castlewood and his\r\ncompanion came from France, her Majesty was taken ill. The St.\r\nAnthony's fire broke out on the royal legs; there was no hurry for\r\nthe presentation of the young lord at Court, or that person who should\r\nappear under his name; and my Lord Viscount's wound breaking out\r\nopportunely, he was kept conveniently in his chamber until such time as\r\nhis physician would allow him to bend his knee before the Queen. At\r\nthe commencement of July, that influential lady, with whom it has been\r\nmentioned that our party had relations, came frequently to visit her\r\nyoung friend, the Maid of Honor, at Kensington, and my Lord Viscount\r\n(the real or supposititious), who was an invalid at Lady Castlewood's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th day of July, the lady in question, who held the most\r\nintimate post about the Queen, came in her chair from the Palace hard\r\nby, bringing to the little party in Kensington Square intelligence of\r\nthe very highest importance. The final blow had been struck, and my Lord\r\nof Oxford and Mortimer was no longer Treasurer. The staff was as yet\r\ngiven to no successor, though my Lord Bolingbroke would undoubtedly be\r\nthe man. And now the time was come, the Queen's Abigail said: and now my\r\nLord Castlewood ought to be presented to the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nAfter that scene which Lord Castlewood witnessed and described to his\r\ncousin, who passed such a miserable night of mortification and jealousy\r\nas he thought over the transaction, no doubt the three persons who were\r\nset by nature as protectors over Beatrix came to the same conclusion,\r\nthat she must be removed from the presence of a man whose desires\r\ntowards her were expressed only too clearly; and who was no more\r\nscrupulous in seeking to gratify them than his father had been before\r\nhim. I suppose Esmond's mistress, her son, and the Colonel himself, had\r\nbeen all secretly debating this matter in their minds, for when Frank\r\nbroke out, in his blunt way, with:--\xe2\x80\x9cI think Beatrix had best be\r\nanywhere but here,\xe2\x80\x9d--Lady Castlewood said:--\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, Frank, I have\r\nthought so, too;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Esmond, though he only remarked that it was\r\nnot for him to speak, showed plainly, by the delight on his countenance,\r\nhow very agreeable that proposal was to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne sees that you think with us, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d says the viscountess, with\r\never so little of sarcasm in her tone: \xe2\x80\x9cBeatrix is best out of this\r\nhouse whilst we have our guest in it, and as soon as this morning's\r\nbusiness is done, she ought to quit London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat morning's business?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Colonel Esmond, not knowing what had\r\nbeen arranged, though in fact the stroke next in importance to that of\r\nbringing the Prince, and of having him acknowledged by the Queen,\r\nwas now being performed at the very moment we three were conversing\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe Court-lady with whom our plan was concerted, and who was a chief\r\nagent in it, the Court physician, and the Bishop of Rochester, who\r\nwere the other two most active participators in our plan, had held many\r\ncouncils in our house at Kensington and elsewhere, as to the means best\r\nto be adopted for presenting our young adventurer to his sister the\r\nQueen. The simple and easy plan proposed by Colonel Esmond had been\r\nagreed to by all parties, which was that on some rather private day,\r\nwhen there were not many persons about the Court, the Prince should\r\nappear there as my Lord Castlewood, should be greeted by his sister in\r\nwaiting, and led by that other lady into the closet of the Queen. And\r\naccording to her Majesty's health or humor, and the circumstances that\r\nmight arise during the interview, it was to be left to the discretion\r\nof those present at it, and to the Prince himself, whether he should\r\ndeclare that it was the Queen's own brother, or the brother of Beatrix\r\nEsmond, who kissed her Royal hand. And this plan being determined on,\r\nwe were all waiting in very much anxiety for the day and signal of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nTwo mornings after that supper, it being the 27th day of July, the\r\nBishop of Rochester breakfasting with Lady Castlewood and her family,\r\nand the meal scarce over, Doctor A.'s coach drove up to our house at\r\nKensington, and the Doctor appeared amongst the party there, enlivening\r\na rather gloomy company; for the mother and daughter had had words in\r\nthe morning in respect to the transactions of that supper, and other\r\nadventures perhaps, and on the day succeeding. Beatrix's haughty spirit\r\nbrooked remonstrances from no superior, much less from her mother, the\r\ngentlest of creatures, whom the girl commanded rather than obeyed. And\r\nfeeling she was wrong, and that by a thousand coquetries (which she\r\ncould no more help exercising on every man that came near her, than the\r\nsun can help shining on great and small) she had provoked the Prince's\r\ndangerous admiration, and allured him to the expression of it, she was\r\nonly the more wilful and imperious the more she felt her error.\r\n\r\nTo this party, the Prince being served with chocolate in his bedchamber,\r\nwhere he lay late, sleeping away the fumes of his wine, the Doctor came,\r\nand by the urgent and startling nature of his news, dissipated instantly\r\nthat private and minor unpleasantry under which the family of Castlewood\r\nwas laboring.\r\n\r\nHe asked for the guest; the guest was above in his own apartment: he\r\nbade Monsieur Baptiste go up to his master instantly, and requested that\r\nMY LORD VISCOUNT CASTLEWOOD would straightway put his uniform on, and\r\ncome away in the Doctor's coach now at the door.\r\n\r\nHe then informed Madam Beatrix what her part of the comedy was to\r\nbe:--\xe2\x80\x9cIn half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cher Majesty and her favorite lady\r\nwill take the air in the Cedar-walk behind the new Banqueting-house. Her\r\nMajesty will be drawn in a garden-chair, Madam Beatrix Esmond and HER\r\nBROTHER, MY LORD VISCOUNT CASTLEWOOD, will be walking in the private\r\ngarden, (here is Lady Masham's key,) and will come unawares upon the\r\nRoyal party. The man that draws the chair will retire, and leave the\r\nQueen, the favorite, and the maid of honor and her brother together;\r\nMistress Beatrix will present her brother, and then!--and then, my Lord\r\nBishop will pray for the result of the interview, and his Scots clerk\r\nwill say Amen! Quick, put on your hood, Madam Beatrix; why doth not his\r\nMajesty come down? Such another chance may not present itself for months\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince was late and lazy, and indeed had all but lost that chance\r\nthrough his indolence. The Queen was actually about to leave the garden\r\njust when the party reached it; the Doctor, the Bishop, the maid of\r\nhonor and her brother went off together in the physician's coach,\r\nand had been gone half an hour when Colonel Esmond came to Kensington\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nThe news of this errand, on which Beatrix was gone, of course for a\r\nmoment put all thoughts of private jealousy out of Colonel Esmond's\r\nhead. In half an hour more the coach returned; the Bishop descended from\r\nit first, and gave his arm to Beatrix, who now came out. His lordship\r\nwent back into the carriage again, and the maid of honor entered the\r\nhouse alone. We were all gazing at her from the upper window, trying to\r\nread from her countenance the result of the interview from which she had\r\njust come.\r\n\r\nShe came into the drawing-room in a great tremor and very pale; she\r\nasked for a glass of water as her mother went to meet her, and after\r\ndrinking that and putting off her hood, she began to speak--\xe2\x80\x9cWe may all\r\nhope for the best,\xe2\x80\x9d says she; \xe2\x80\x9cit has cost the Queen a fit. Her Majesty\r\nwas in her chair in the Cedar-walk, accompanied only by Lady ----, when\r\nwe entered by the private wicket from the west side of the garden, and\r\nturned towards her, the Doctor following us. They waited in a side\r\nwalk hidden by the shrubs, as we advanced towards the chair. My heart\r\nthrobbed so I scarce could speak; but my Prince whispered, 'Courage,\r\nBeatrix,' and marched on with a steady step. His face was a little\r\nflushed, but he was not afraid of the danger. He who fought so bravely\r\nat Malplaquet fears nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond and Castlewood looked at each other\r\nat this compliment, neither liking the sound of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prince uncovered,\xe2\x80\x9d Beatrix continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand I saw the Queen turning\r\nround to Lady Masham, as if asking who these two were. Her Majesty\r\nlooked very pale and ill, and then flushed up; the favorite made us a\r\nsignal to advance, and I went up, leading my Prince by the hand, quite\r\nclose to the chair: 'Your Majesty will give my Lord Viscount your hand\r\nto kiss,' says her lady, and the Queen put out her hand, which the\r\nPrince kissed, kneeling on his knee, he who should kneel to no mortal\r\nman or woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You have been long from England, my lord,' says the Queen: 'why were\r\nyou not here to give a home to your mother and sister?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I am come, Madam, to stay now, if the Queen desires me,' says the\r\nPrince, with another low bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You have taken a foreign wife, my lord, and a foreign religion; was\r\nnot that of England good enough for you?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'In returning to my father's church,' says the Prince, 'I do not love\r\nmy mother the less, nor am I the less faithful servant of your majesty.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, \xe2\x80\x9cthe favorite gave me a little signal with her\r\nhand to fall back, which I did, though I died to hear what should pass;\r\nand whispered something to the Queen, which made her Majesty start and\r\nutter one or two words in a hurried manner, looking towards the Prince,\r\nand catching hold with her hand of the arm of her chair. He advanced\r\nstill nearer towards it; he began to speak very rapidly; I caught the\r\nwords, 'Father, blessing, forgiveness,'--and then presently the Prince\r\nfell on his knees; took from his breast a paper he had there, handed it\r\nto the Queen, who, as soon as she saw it, flung up both her arms with\r\na scream, and took away that hand nearest the Prince, and which he\r\nendeavored to kiss. He went on speaking with great animation of gesture,\r\nnow clasping his hands together on his heart, now opening them as though\r\nto say: 'I am here, your brother, in your power.' Lady Masham ran round\r\non the other side of the chair, kneeling too, and speaking with great\r\nenergy. She clasped the Queen's hand on her side, and picked up the\r\npaper her Majesty had let fall. The Prince rose and made a further\r\nspeech as though he would go; the favorite on the other hand urging her\r\nmistress, and then, running back to the Prince, brought him back once\r\nmore close to the chair. Again he knelt down and took the Queen's hand,\r\nwhich she did not withdraw, kissing it a hundred times; my lady all the\r\ntime, with sobs and supplications, speaking over the chair. This while\r\nthe Queen sat with a stupefied look, crumpling the paper with one hand,\r\nas my Prince embraced the other; then of a sudden she uttered several\r\npiercing shrieks, and burst into a great fit of hysteric tears and\r\nlaughter. 'Enough, enough, sir, for this time,' I heard Lady Masham\r\nsay: and the chairman, who had withdrawn round the Banqueting-room, came\r\nback, alarmed by the cries. 'Quick,' says Lady Masham, 'get some help,'\r\nand I ran towards the Doctor, who, with the Bishop of Rochester, came up\r\ninstantly. Lady Masham whispered the Prince he might hope for the very\r\nbest; and to be ready to-morrow; and he hath gone away to the Bishop\r\nof Rochester's house, to meet several of his friends there. And so the\r\ngreat stroke is struck,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, going down on her knees, and\r\nclasping her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the King: God save the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeatrix's tale told, and the young lady herself calmed somewhat of\r\nher agitation, we asked with regard to the Prince, who was absent with\r\nBishop Atterbury, and were informed that 'twas likely he might remain\r\nabroad the whole day. Beatrix's three kinsfolk looked at one another at\r\nthis intelligence: 'twas clear the same thought was passing through the\r\nminds of all.\r\n\r\nBut who should begin to break the news? Monsieur Baptiste, that is Frank\r\nCastlewood, turned very red, and looked towards Esmond; the Colonel\r\nbit his lips, and fairly beat a retreat into the window: it was Lady\r\nCastlewood that opened upon Beatrix with the news which we knew would do\r\nanything but please her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are glad,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, taking her daughter's hand, and speaking in a\r\ngentle voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the guest is away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeatrix drew back in an instant, looking round her at us three, and\r\nas if divining a danger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy glad?\xe2\x80\x9d says she, her breast beginning to\r\nheave; \xe2\x80\x9care you so soon tired of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe think one of us is devilishly too fond of him,\xe2\x80\x9d cries out Frank\r\nCastlewood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd which is it--you, my lord, or is it mamma, who is jealous because\r\nhe drinks my health? or is it the head of the family\xe2\x80\x9d (here she turned\r\nwith an imperious look towards Colonel Esmond), \xe2\x80\x9cwho has taken of late\r\nto preach the King sermons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not say you are too free with his Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, with a toss of the head and a\r\ncurtsey.\r\n\r\nBut her mother continued, with very great calmness and dignity--\xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nleast we have not said so, though we might, were it possible for a\r\nmother to say such words to her own daughter, your father's daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? mon pere,\xe2\x80\x9d breaks out Beatrix, \xe2\x80\x9cwas no better than other persons'\r\nfathers.\xe2\x80\x9d And again she looked towards the Colonel.\r\n\r\nWe all felt a shock as she uttered those two or three French words; her\r\nmanner was exactly imitated from that of our foreign guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had not learned to speak French a month ago, Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d says her\r\nmother, sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cnor to speak ill of your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeatrix, no doubt, saw that slip she had made in her flurry, for she\r\nblushed crimson: \xe2\x80\x9cI have learnt to honor the King,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, drawing\r\nup, \xe2\x80\x9cand 'twere as well that others suspected neither his Majesty nor\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you respected your mother a little more,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank said, \xe2\x80\x9cTrix, you\r\nwould do yourself no hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no child,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, turning round on him; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have lived very\r\nwell these five years without the benefit of your advice or example, and\r\nI intend to take neither now. Why does not the head of the house speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she went on; \xe2\x80\x9che rules everything here. When his chaplain has done\r\nsinging the psalms, will his lordship deliver the sermon? I am tired of\r\nthe psalms.\xe2\x80\x9d The Prince had used almost the very same words in regard to\r\nColonel Esmond that the imprudent girl repeated in her wrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou show yourself a very apt scholar, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel;\r\nand, turning to his mistress, \xe2\x80\x9cDid your guest use these words in your\r\nladyship's hearing, or was it to Beatrix in private that he was pleased\r\nto impart his opinion regarding my tiresome sermon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him alone?\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord, starting up with an oath: \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nGod, have you seen him alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere he here, you wouldn't dare so to insult me; no, you would not\r\ndare!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Frank's sister. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your oaths, my lord, for your wife;\r\nwe are not used here to such language. Till you came, there used to be\r\nkindness between me and mamma, and I cared for her when you never did,\r\nwhen you were away for years with your horses and your mistress, and\r\nyour Popish wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy ---,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, rapping out another oath, \xe2\x80\x9cClotilda is an angel;\r\nhow dare you say a word against Clotilda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColonel Esmond could not refrain from a smile, to see how easy Frank's\r\nattack was drawn off by that feint:--\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy Clotilda is not the\r\nsubject in hand,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond, rather scornfully; \xe2\x80\x9cher ladyship is\r\nat Paris, a hundred leagues off, preparing baby-linen. It is about my\r\nLord Castlewood's sister, and not his wife, the question is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not my Lord Castlewood,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, \xe2\x80\x9cand he knows he is not;\r\nhe is Colonel Francis Esmond's son, and no more, and he wears a false\r\ntitle; and he lives on another man's land, and he knows it.\xe2\x80\x9d Here was\r\nanother desperate sally of the poor beleaguered garrison, and an alerte\r\nin another quarter. \xe2\x80\x9cAgain, I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\r\nare no proofs of my claim, I have no claim. If my father acknowledged\r\nno heir, yours was his lawful successor, and my Lord Castlewood hath\r\nas good a right to his rank and small estate as any man in England. But\r\nthat again is not the question, as you know very well; let us bring our\r\ntalk back to it, as you will have me meddle in it. And I will give\r\nyou frankly my opinion, that a house where a Prince lies all day, who\r\nrespects no woman, is no house for a young unmarried lady; that you were\r\nbetter in the country than here; that he is here on a great end, from\r\nwhich no folly should divert him; and that having nobly done your part\r\nof this morning, Beatrix, you should retire off the scene awhile, and\r\nleave it to the other actors of the play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the Colonel spoke with a perfect calmness and politeness, such as\r\n'tis to be hoped he hath always shown to women,* his mistress stood by\r\nhim on one side of the table, and Frank Castlewood on the other, hemming\r\nin poor Beatrix, that was behind it, and, as it were, surrounding her\r\nwith our approaches.\r\n\r\n     * My dear father saith quite truly, that his manner towards\r\n     our sex was uniformly courteous.  From my infancy upwards,\r\n     he treated me with an extreme gentleness, as though I was a\r\n     little lady.  I can scarce remember (though I tried him\r\n     often) ever hearing a rough word from him, nor was he less\r\n     grave and kind in his manner to the humblest negresses on\r\n     his estate.  He was familiar with no one except my mother,\r\n     and it was delightful to witness up to the very last days\r\n     the confidence between them.  He was obeyed eagerly by all\r\n     under him; and my mother and all her household lived in a\r\n     constant emulation to please him, and quite a terror lest in\r\n     any way they should offend him.  He was the humblest man\r\n     with all this; the least exacting, the more easily\r\n     contented; and Mr. Benson, our minister at Castlewood, who\r\n     attended him at the last, ever said--\xe2\x80\x9cI know not what\r\n     Colonel Esmond's doctrine was, but his life and death were\r\n     those of a devout Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d--R. E. W.\r\n\r\nHaving twice sallied out and been beaten back, she now, as I expected,\r\ntried the ultima ratio of women, and had recourse to tears. Her\r\nbeautiful eyes filled with them; I never could bear in her, nor in any\r\nwoman, that expression of pain:--\xe2\x80\x9cI am alone,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed she; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nthree against me--my brother, my mother, and you. What have I done, that\r\nyou should speak and look so unkindly at me? Is it my fault that the\r\nPrince should, as you say, admire me? Did I bring him here? Did I do\r\naught but what you bade me, in making him welcome? Did you not tell me\r\nthat our duty was to die for him? Did you not teach me, mother, night\r\nand morning to pray for the King, before even ourselves? What would you\r\nhave of me, cousin, for you are the chief of the conspiracy against me;\r\nI know you are, sir, and that my mother and brother are acting but as\r\nyou bid them; whither would you have me go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would but remove from the Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9ca dangerous\r\ntemptation; heaven forbid I should say you would yield; I would only\r\nhave him free of it. Your honor needs no guardian, please God, but his\r\nimprudence doth. He is so far removed from all women by his rank, that\r\nhis pursuit of them cannot but be unlawful. We would remove the dearest\r\nand fairest of our family from the chance of that insult, and that is\r\nwhy we would have you go, dear Beatrix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry speaks like a book,\xe2\x80\x9d says Frank, with one of his oaths, \xe2\x80\x9cand, by\r\n---, every word he saith is true. You can't help being handsome, Trix;\r\nno more can the Prince help following you. My counsel is that you go out\r\nof harm's way; for, by the Lord, were the Prince to play any tricks with\r\nyou, King as he is, or is to be, Harry Esmond and I would have justice\r\nof him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre not two such champions enough to guard me?\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, something\r\nsorrowfully; \xe2\x80\x9csure, with you two watching, no evil could happen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn faith, I think not, Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel Esmond; \xe2\x80\x9cnor if the\r\nPrince knew us would he try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut does he know you?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Lady Castlewood, very quiet: \xe2\x80\x9che\r\ncomes of a country where the pursuit of kings is thought no dishonor\r\nto a woman. Let us go, dearest Beatrix. Shall we go to Walcote or to\r\nCastlewood? We are best away from the city; and when the Prince is\r\nacknowledged, and our champions have restored him, and he hath his own\r\nhouse at St. James's or Windsor, we can come back to ours here. Do you\r\nnot think so, Harry and Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank and Harry thought with her, you may be sure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go, then,\xe2\x80\x9d says Beatrix, turning a little pale; \xe2\x80\x9cLady Masham is\r\nto give me warning to-night how her Majesty is, and to-morrow--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had best go to-day, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Lady Castlewood; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nmight have the coach and sleep at Hounslow, and reach home to-morrow.\r\n'Tis twelve o'clock; bid the coach, cousin, be ready at one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Beatrix, in a passion of tears and mortification.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou disgrace me by your cruel precautions; my own mother is the first\r\nto suspect me, and would take me away as my gaoler. I will not go with\r\nyou, mother; I will go as no one's prisoner. If I wanted to deceive, do\r\nyou think I could find no means of evading you? My family suspects me.\r\nAs those mistrust me that ought to love me most, let me leave them; I\r\nwill go, but I will go alone: to Castlewood, be it. I have been unhappy\r\nthere and lonely enough; let me go back, but spare me at least the\r\nhumiliation of setting a watch over my misery, which is a trial I can't\r\nbear. Let me go when you will, but alone, or not at all. You three can\r\nstay and triumph over my unhappiness, and I will bear it as I have borne\r\nit before. Let my gaoler-in-chief go order the coach that is to take me\r\naway. I thank you, Henry Esmond, for your share in the conspiracy. All\r\nmy life long I'll thank you, and remember you, and you, brother, and\r\nyou, mother, how shall I show my gratitude to you for your careful\r\ndefence of my honor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe swept out of the room with the air of an empress, flinging glances\r\nof defiance at us all, and leaving us conquerors of the field, but\r\nscared, and almost ashamed of our victory. It did indeed seem hard and\r\ncruel that we three should have conspired the banishment and humiliation\r\nof that fair creature. We looked at each other in silence: 'twas not the\r\nfirst stroke by many of our actions in that unlucky time, which, being\r\ndone, we wished undone. We agreed it was best she should go alone,\r\nspeaking stealthily to one another, and under our breaths, like persons\r\nengaged in an act they felt ashamed in doing.\r\n\r\nIn a half-hour, it might be, after our talk she came back, her\r\ncountenance wearing the same defiant air which it had borne when\r\nshe left us. She held a shagreen-case in her hand; Esmond knew it as\r\ncontaining his diamonds which he had given to her for her marriage with\r\nDuke Hamilton, and which she had worn so splendidly on the inauspicious\r\nnight of the Prince's arrival. \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought back,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nthe Marquis of Esmond the present he deigned to make me in days when he\r\ntrusted me better than now. I will never accept a benefit or a kindness\r\nfrom Henry Esmond more, and I give back these family diamonds, which\r\nbelonged to one king's mistress, to the gentleman that suspected I would\r\nbe another. Have you been upon your message of coach-caller, my Lord\r\nMarquis? Will you send your valet to see that I do not run away?\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\nwere right, yet, by her manner, she had put us all in the wrong; we\r\nwere conquerors, yet the honors of the day seemed to be with the poor\r\noppressed girl.\r\n\r\nThat luckless box containing the stones had first been ornamented with\r\na baron's coronet, when Beatrix was engaged to the young gentleman from\r\nwhom she parted, and afterwards the gilt crown of a duchess figured\r\non the cover, which also poor Beatrix was destined never to wear. Lady\r\nCastlewood opened the case mechanically and scarce thinking what she\r\ndid; and behold, besides the diamonds, Esmond's present, there lay in\r\nthe box the enamelled miniature of the late Duke, which Beatrix had laid\r\naside with her mourning when the King came into the house; and which the\r\npoor heedless thing very likely had forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you leave this, too, Beatrix?\xe2\x80\x9d says her mother, taking the miniature\r\nout, and with a cruelty she did not very often show; but there are some\r\nmoments when the tenderest women are cruel, and some triumphs which\r\nangels can't forego.*\r\n\r\n     * This remark shows how unjustly and contemptuously even the\r\n     best of men will sometimes judge of our sex.  Lady\r\n     Castlewood had no intention of triumphing over her daughter;\r\n     but from a sense of duty alone pointed out her deplorable\r\n     wrong.--H. E.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered this stab, Lady Castlewood was frightened at the effect\r\nof her blow. It went to poor Beatrix's heart: she flushed up and passed\r\na handkerchief across her eyes, and kissed the miniature, and put it\r\ninto her bosom:--\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgot it,\xe2\x80\x9d says she; \xe2\x80\x9cmy injury made me forget\r\nmy grief: my mother has recalled both to me. Farewell, mother; I think I\r\nnever can forgive you; something hath broke between us that no tears\r\nnor years can repair. I always said I was alone; you never loved me,\r\nnever--and were jealous of me from the time I sat on my father's knee.\r\nLet me go away, the sooner the better: I can bear to be with you no\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, child,\xe2\x80\x9d says her mother, still very stern; \xe2\x80\x9cgo and bend your\r\nproud knees and ask forgiveness; go, pray in solitude for humility and\r\nrepentance. 'Tis not your reproaches that make me unhappy, 'tis your\r\nhard heart, my poor Beatrix; may God soften it, and teach you one day to\r\nfeel for your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf my mistress was cruel, at least she never could be got to own as\r\nmuch. Her haughtiness quite overtopped Beatrix's; and, if the girl had a\r\nproud spirit, I very much fear it came to her by inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nOUR GUEST QUITS US AS NOT BEING HOSPITABLE ENOUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeatrix's departure took place within an hour, her maid going with her\r\nin the post-chaise, and a man armed on the coach-box to prevent any\r\ndanger of the road. Esmond and Frank thought of escorting the carriage,\r\nbut she indignantly refused their company, and another man was sent to\r\nfollow the coach, and not to leave it till it had passed over Hounslow\r\nHeath on the next day. And these two forming the whole of Lady\r\nCastlewood's male domestics, Mr. Esmond's faithful John Lockwood came\r\nto wait on his mistress during their absence, though he would have\r\npreferred to escort Mrs. Lucy, his sweetheart, on her journey into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe had a gloomy and silent meal; it seemed as if a darkness was over the\r\nhouse, since the bright face of Beatrix had been withdrawn from it. In\r\nthe afternoon came a message from the favorite to relieve us somewhat\r\nfrom this despondency. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Queen hath been much shaken,\xe2\x80\x9d the note said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe is better now, and all things will go well. Let MY LORD CASTLEWOOD\r\nbe ready against we send for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt night there came a second billet: \xe2\x80\x9cThere hath been a great battle in\r\nCouncil; Lord Treasurer hath broke his staff, and hath fallen never to\r\nrise again; no successor is appointed. Lord B----receives a great Whig\r\ncompany to-night at Golden Square. If he is trimming, others are true;\r\nthe Queen hath no more fits, but is a-bed now, and more quiet. Be ready\r\nagainst morning, when I still hope all will be well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince came home shortly after the messenger who bore this billet\r\nhad left the house. His Royal Highness was so much the better for the\r\nBishop's liquor, that to talk affairs to him now was of little service.\r\nHe was helped to the Royal bed; he called Castlewood familiarly by his\r\nown name; he quite forgot the part upon the acting of which his crown,\r\nhis safety, depended. 'Twas lucky that my Lady Castlewood's servants\r\nwere out of the way, and only those heard him who would not betray\r\nhim. He inquired after the adorable Beatrix, with a royal hiccup in his\r\nvoice; he was easily got to bed, and in a minute or two plunged in that\r\ndeep slumber and forgetfulness with which Bacchus rewards the votaries\r\nof that god. We wished Beatrix had been there to see him in his cups. We\r\nregretted, perhaps, that she was gone.\r\n\r\nOne of the party at Kensington Square was fool enough to ride to\r\nHounslow that night, coram latronibus, and to the inn which the family\r\nused ordinarily in their journeys out of London. Esmond desired my\r\nlandlord not to acquaint Madam Beatrix with his coming, and had the grim\r\nsatisfaction of passing by the door of the chamber where she lay with\r\nher maid, and of watching her chariot set forth in the early morning. He\r\nsaw her smile and slip money into the man's hand who was ordered to ride\r\nbehind the coach as far as Bagshot. The road being open, and the other\r\nservant armed, it appeared she dispensed with the escort of a second\r\ndomestic; and this fellow, bidding his young mistress adieu with many\r\nbows, went and took a pot of ale in the kitchen, and returned in company\r\nwith his brother servant, John Coachman, and his horses, back to London.\r\n\r\nThey were not a mile out of Hounslow when the two worthies stopped for\r\nmore drink, and here they were scared by seeing Colonel Esmond gallop by\r\nthem. The man said in reply to Colonel Esmond's stern question, that his\r\nyoung mistress had sent her duty; only that, no other message: she had\r\nhad a very good night, and would reach Castlewood by nightfall. The\r\nColonel had no time for further colloquy, and galloped on swiftly to\r\nLondon, having business of great importance there, as my reader very\r\nwell knoweth. The thought of Beatrix riding away from the danger soothed\r\nhis mind not a little. His horse was at Kensington Square (honest Dapple\r\nknew the way thither well enough) before the tipsy guest of last night\r\nwas awake and sober.\r\n\r\nThe account of the previous evening was known all over the town early\r\nnext day. A violent altercation had taken place before the Queen in\r\nthe Council Chamber; and all the coffee-houses had their version of the\r\nquarrel. The news brought my Lord Bishop early to Kensington Square,\r\nwhere he awaited the waking of his Royal master above stairs, and spoke\r\nconfidently of having him proclaimed as Prince of Wales and heir to\r\nthe throne before that day was over. The Bishop had entertained on the\r\nprevious afternoon certain of the most influential gentlemen of the\r\ntrue British party. His Royal highness had charmed all, both Scots and\r\nEnglish, Papists and Churchmen: \xe2\x80\x9cEven Quakers,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cwere at our\r\nmeeting; and, if the stranger took a little too much British punch and\r\nale, he will soon grow more accustomed to those liquors; and my Lord\r\nCastlewood,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Bishop with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cmust bear the cruel charge\r\nof having been for once in his life a little tipsy. He toasted your\r\nlovely sister a dozen times, at which we all laughed,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Bishop,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cadmiring so much fraternal affection.--Where is that charming nymph,\r\nand why doth she not adorn your ladyship's tea-table with her bright\r\neyes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer ladyship said, dryly, that Beatrix was not at home that morning;\r\nmy Lord Bishop was too busy with great affairs to trouble himself much\r\nabout the presence or absence of any lady, however beautiful.\r\n\r\nWe were yet at table when Dr. A---- came from the Palace with a look of\r\ngreat alarm; the shocks the Queen had had the day before had acted on\r\nher severely; he had been sent for, and had ordered her to be blooded.\r\nThe surgeon of Long Acre had come to cup the Queen, and her Majesty was\r\nnow more easy and breathed more freely. What made us start at the name\r\nof Mr. Ayme? \xe2\x80\x9cIl faut etre aimable pour etre aime,\xe2\x80\x9d says the merry\r\nDoctor; Esmond pulled his sleeve, and bade him hush. It was to Ayme's\r\nhouse, after his fatal duel, that my dear Lord Castlewood, Frank's\r\nfather, had been carried to die.\r\n\r\nNo second visit could be paid to the Queen on that day at any rate; and\r\nwhen our guest above gave his signal that he was awake, the Doctor, the\r\nBishop, and Colonel Esmond waited upon the Prince's levee, and\r\nbrought him their news, cheerful or dubious. The Doctor had to go away\r\npresently, but promised to keep the Prince constantly acquainted with\r\nwhat was taking place at the Palace hard by. His counsel was, and the\r\nBishop's, that as soon as ever the Queen's malady took a favorable turn,\r\nthe Prince should be introduced to her bedside; the Council summoned;\r\nthe guard at Kensington and St. James's, of which two regiments were to\r\nbe entirely relied on, and one known not to be hostile, would declare\r\nfor the Prince, as the Queen would before the Lords of her Council,\r\ndesignating him as the heir to her throne.\r\n\r\nWith locked doors, and Colonel Esmond acting as secretary, the Prince\r\nand his Lordship of Rochester passed many hours of this day, composing\r\nProclamations and Addresses to the Country, to the Scots, to the Clergy,\r\nto the People of London and England; announcing the arrival of the exile\r\ndescendant of three sovereigns, and his acknowledgment by his sister as\r\nheir to the throne. Every safeguard for their liberties, the Church and\r\nPeople could ask, was promised to them. The Bishop could answer for the\r\nadhesion of very many prelates, who besought of their flocks and brother\r\necclesiastics to recognize the sacred right of the future sovereign, and\r\nto purge the country of the sin of rebellion.\r\n\r\nDuring the composition of these papers, more messengers than one came\r\nfrom the Palace regarding the state of the august patient there lying.\r\nAt mid-day she was somewhat better; at evening the torpor again seized\r\nher, and she wandered in her mind. At night Dr. A---- was with us again,\r\nwith a report rather more favorable: no instant danger at any rate was\r\napprehended. In the course of the last two years her Majesty had had\r\nmany attacks similar, but more severe.\r\n\r\nBy this time we had finished a half-dozen of Proclamations, (the wording\r\nof them so as to offend no parties, and not to give umbrage to Whigs or\r\nDissenters, required very great caution,) and the young Prince, who had\r\nindeed shown, during a long day's labor, both alacrity at seizing the\r\ninformation given him, and ingenuity and skill in turning the phrases\r\nwhich were to go out signed by his name, here exhibited a good-humor and\r\nthoughtfulness that ought to be set down to his credit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere these papers to be mislaid,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cor our scheme to come to\r\nmishap, my Lord Esmond's writing would bring him to a place where I\r\nheartily hope never to see him; and so, by your leave, I will copy the\r\npapers myself, though I am not very strong in spelling; and if they are\r\nfound they will implicate none but the person they most concern;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nso, having carefully copied the Proclamations out, the Prince burned\r\nthose in Colonel Esmond's handwriting: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, and now, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says he, \xe2\x80\x9clet us go to supper, and drink a glass with the ladies. My\r\nLord Esmond, you will sup with us to-night; you have given us of late\r\ntoo little of your company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince's meals were commonly served in the chamber which had been\r\nBeatrix's bedroom, adjoining that in which he slept. And the dutiful\r\npractice of his entertainers was to wait until their Royal guest bade\r\nthem take their places at table before they sat down to partake of the\r\nmeal. On this night, as you may suppose, only Frank Castlewood and his\r\nmother were in waiting when the supper was announced to receive the\r\nPrince; who had passed the whole of the day in his own apartment, with\r\nthe Bishop as his Minister of State, and Colonel Esmond officiating as\r\nSecretary of his Council.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's countenance wore an expression by no means pleasant; when\r\nlooking towards the little company assembled, and waiting for him, he\r\ndid not see Beatrix's bright face there as usual to greet him. He asked\r\nLady Esmond for his fair introducer of yesterday: her ladyship only cast\r\nher eyes down, and said quietly, Beatrix could not be of the supper that\r\nnight; nor did she show the least sign of confusion, whereas Castlewood\r\nturned red, and Esmond was no less embarrassed. I think women have an\r\ninstinct of dissimulation; they know by nature how to disguise their\r\nemotions far better than the most consummate male courtiers can do. Is\r\nnot the better part of the life of many of them spent in hiding their\r\nfeelings, in cajoling their tyrants, in masking over with fond smiles\r\nand artful gayety, their doubt, or their grief, or their terror?\r\n\r\nOur guest swallowed his supper very sulkily; it was not till the second\r\nbottle his Highness began to rally. When Lady Castlewood asked leave to\r\ndepart, he sent a message to Beatrix, hoping she would be present at the\r\nnext day's dinner, and applied himself to drink, and to talk afterwards,\r\nfor which there was subject in plenty.\r\n\r\nThe next day, we heard from our informer at Kensington that the Queen\r\nwas somewhat better, and had been up for an hour, though she was not\r\nwell enough yet to receive any visitor.\r\n\r\nAt dinner a single cover was laid for his Royal Highness; and the two\r\ngentlemen alone waited on him. We had had a consultation in the morning\r\nwith Lady Castlewood, in which it had been determined that, should his\r\nHighness ask further questions about Beatrix, he should be answered by\r\nthe gentlemen of the house.\r\n\r\nHe was evidently disturbed and uneasy, looking towards the door\r\nconstantly, as if expecting some one. There came, however, nobody,\r\nexcept honest John Lockwood, when he knocked with a dish, which those\r\nwithin took from him; so the meals were always arranged, and I believe\r\nthe council in the kitchen were of opinion that my young lord had\r\nbrought over a priest, who had converted us all into Papists, and that\r\nPapists were like Jews, eating together, and not choosing to take their\r\nmeals in the sight of Christians.\r\n\r\nThe Prince tried to cover his displeasure; he was but a clumsy\r\ndissembler at that time, and when out of humor could with difficulty\r\nkeep a serene countenance; and having made some foolish attempts at\r\ntrivial talk, he came to his point presently, and in as easy a manner\r\nas he could, saying to Lord Castlewood, he hoped, he requested, his\r\nlordship's mother and sister would be of the supper that night. As\r\nthe time hung heavy on him, and he must not go abroad, would not Miss\r\nBeatrix hold him company at a game of cards?\r\n\r\nAt this, looking up at Esmond, and taking the signal from him, Lord\r\nCastlewood informed his Royal Highness* that his sister Beatrix was not\r\nat Kensington; and that her family had thought it best she should quit\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\n     * In London we addressed the Prince as Royal Highness\r\n     invariably, though the women persisted in giving him the\r\n     title of King.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at Kensington!\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cis she ill? she was well yesterday;\r\nwherefore should she quit the town? Is it at your orders, my lord, or\r\nColonel Esmond's, who seems the master of this house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot of this, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says Frank very nobly, \xe2\x80\x9conly of our house in the\r\ncountry, which he hath given to us. This is my mother's house, and\r\nWalcote is my father's, and the Marquis of Esmond knows he hath but to\r\ngive his word, and I return his to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Marquis of Esmond!--the Marquis of Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince,\r\ntossing off a glass, \xe2\x80\x9cmeddles too much with my affairs, and presumes\r\non the service he hath done me. If you want to carry your suit with\r\nBeatrix, my lord, by blocking her up in gaol, let me tell you that is\r\nnot the way to win a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not aware, sir, that I had spoken of my suit to Madam Beatrix to\r\nyour Royal Highness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah, bah, Monsieur! we need not be a conjurer to see that. It makes\r\nitself seen at all moments. You are jealous, my lord, and the maid of\r\nhonor cannot look at another face without yours beginning to scowl. That\r\nwhich you do is unworthy, Monsieur; is inhospitable--is, is lache, yes,\r\nlache:\xe2\x80\x9d (he spoke rapidly in French, his rage carrying him away with each\r\nphrase:) \xe2\x80\x9cI come to your house; I risk my life; I pass it in ennui; I\r\nrepose myself on your fidelity; I have no company but your lordship's\r\nsermons or the conversations of that adorable young lady, and you take\r\nher from me, and you, you rest! Merci, Monsieur! I shall thank you\r\nwhen I have the means; I shall know to recompense a devotion a little\r\nimportunate, my lord--a little importunate. For a month past your airs\r\nof protector have annoyed me beyond measure. You deign to offer me the\r\ncrown, and bid me take it on my knees like King John--eh! I know my\r\nhistory, Monsieur, and mock myself of frowning barons. I admire your\r\nmistress, and you send her to a Bastile of the Province; I enter your\r\nhouse, and you mistrust me. I will leave it, Monsieur; from to-night I\r\nwill leave it. I have other friends whose loyalty will not be so ready\r\nto question mine. If I have garters to give away, 'tis to noblemen who\r\nare not so ready to think evil. Bring me a coach and let me quit this\r\nplace, or let the fair Beatrix return to it. I will not have your\r\nhospitality at the expense of the freedom of that fair creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis harangue was uttered with rapid gesticulation such as the French\r\nuse, and in the language of that nation. The Prince striding up and down\r\nthe room; his face flushed, and his hands trembling with anger. He was\r\nvery thin and frail from repeated illness and a life of pleasure. Either\r\nCastlewood or Esmond could have broke him across their knee, and in\r\nhalf a minute's struggle put an end to him; and here he was insulting\r\nus both, and scarce deigning to hide from the two, whose honor it most\r\nconcerned, the passion he felt for the young lady of our family. My Lord\r\nCastlewood replied to the Prince's tirade very nobly and simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cyour Royal Highness is pleased to forget that others\r\nrisk their lives, and for your cause. Very few Englishmen, please God,\r\nwould dare to lay hands on your sacred person, though none would ever\r\nthink of respecting ours. Our family's lives are at your service, and\r\neverything we have except our honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonor! bah, sir, who ever thought of hurting your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nPrince with a peevish air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe implore your Royal Highness never to think of hurting it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lord\r\nCastlewood with a low bow. The night being warm, the windows were open\r\nboth towards the Gardens and the Square. Colonel Esmond heard through\r\nthe closed door the voice of the watchman calling the hour, in the\r\nsquare on the other side. He opened the door communicating with the\r\nPrince's room; Martin, the servant that had rode with Beatrix to\r\nHounslow, was just going out of the chamber as Esmond entered it, and\r\nwhen the fellow was gone, and the watchman again sang his cry of \xe2\x80\x9cPast\r\nten o'clock, and a starlight night,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond spoke to the Prince in a low\r\nvoice, and said--\xe2\x80\x9cYour Royal Highness hears that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApres, Monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have but to beckon him from the window, and send him fifty yards, and\r\nhe returns with a guard of men, and I deliver up to him the body of the\r\nperson calling himself James the Third, for whose capture Parliament\r\nhath offered a reward of 500L., as your Royal Highness saw on our ride\r\nfrom Rochester. I have but to say the word, and, by the heaven that made\r\nme, I would say it if I thought the Prince, for his honor's sake, would\r\nnot desist from insulting ours. But the first gentleman of England knows\r\nhis duty too well to forget himself with the humblest, or peril his\r\ncrown for a deed that were shameful if it were done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your lordship anything to say,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince, turning to Frank\r\nCastlewood, and quite pale with anger; \xe2\x80\x9cany threat or any insult, with\r\nwhich you would like to end this agreeable night's entertainment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI follow the head of our house,\xe2\x80\x9d says Castlewood, bowing gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nwhat time shall it please the Prince that we should wait upon him in the\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will wait on the Bishop of Rochester early, you will bid him bring\r\nhis coach hither; and prepare an apartment for me in his own house, or\r\nin a place of safety. The King will reward you handsomely, never fear,\r\nfor all you have done in his behalf. I wish you a good night, and\r\nshall go to bed, unless it pleases the Marquis of Esmond to call his\r\ncolleague, the watchman, and that I should pass the night with the\r\nKensington guard. Fare you well, be sure I will remember you. My Lord\r\nCastlewood, I can go to bed to-night without need of a chamberlain.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthe Prince dismissed us with a grim bow, locking one door as he spoke,\r\nthat into the supping-room, and the other through which we passed, after\r\nus. It led into the small chamber which Frank Castlewood or MONSIEUR\r\nBAPTISTE occupied, and by which Martin entered when Colonel Esmond but\r\nnow saw him in the chamber.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour next morning the Bishop arrived, and was closeted for\r\nsome time with his master in his own apartment, where the Prince laid\r\nopen to his counsellor the wrongs which, according to his version, he\r\nhad received from the gentlemen of the Esmond family. The worthy prelate\r\ncame out from the conference with an air of great satisfaction; he was a\r\nman full of resources, and of a most assured fidelity, and possessed of\r\ngenius, and a hundred good qualities; but captious and of a most jealous\r\ntemper, that could not help exulting at the downfall of any favorite;\r\nand he was pleased in spite of himself to hear that the Esmond Ministry\r\nwas at an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have soothed your guest,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, coming out to the two gentlemen\r\nand the widow; who had been made acquainted with somewhat of the dispute\r\nof the night before. (By the version we gave her, the Prince was only\r\nmade to exhibit anger because we doubted of his intentions in respect\r\nto Beatrix; and to leave us, because we questioned his honor.) \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nthink, all things considered, 'tis as well he should leave this house;\r\nand then, my Lady Castlewood,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9cmy pretty Beatrix may\r\ncome back to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is quite as well at home at Castlewood,\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond's mistress said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctill everything is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have your title, Esmond, that I promise you,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\ngood Bishop, assuming the airs of a Prime Minister. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prince hath\r\nexpressed himself most nobly in regard of the little difference of last\r\nnight, and I promise you he hath listened to my sermon, as well as to\r\nthat of other folks,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Doctor, archly; \xe2\x80\x9che hath every great and\r\ngenerous quality, with perhaps a weakness for the sex which belongs to\r\nhis family, and hath been known in scores of popular sovereigns from\r\nKing David downwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d breaks out Lady Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cthe levity with which\r\nyou speak of such conduct towards our sex shocks me, and what you call\r\nweakness I call deplorable sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSin it is, my dear creature,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Bishop, with a shrug, taking\r\nsnuff; \xe2\x80\x9cbut consider what a sinner King Solomon was, and in spite of a\r\nthousand of wives too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of this, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lady Castlewood, with a fine blush, and\r\nwalked out of the room very stately.\r\n\r\nThe Prince entered it presently with a smile on his face, and if he felt\r\nany offence against us on the previous night, at present exhibited none.\r\nHe offered a hand to each gentleman with great courtesy. \xe2\x80\x9cIf all your\r\nbishops preach so well as Doctor Atterbury.\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't know,\r\ngentlemen, what may happen to me. I spoke very hastily, my lords, last\r\nnight, and ask pardon of both of you. But I must not stay any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says he, \xe2\x80\x9cgiving umbrage to good friends, or keeping pretty girls away\r\nfrom their homes. My Lord Bishop hath found a safe place for me, hard\r\nby at a curate's house, whom the Bishop can trust, and whose wife is so\r\nugly as to be beyond all danger; we will decamp into those new quarters,\r\nand I leave you, thanking you for a hundred kindnesses here. Where is\r\nmy hostess, that I may bid her farewell; to welcome her in a house of my\r\nown, soon, I trust, where my friends shall have no cause to quarrel with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Castlewood arrived presently, blushing with great grace, and tears\r\nfilling her eyes as the Prince graciously saluted her. She looked so\r\ncharming and young, that the doctor, in his bantering way, could not\r\nhelp speaking of her beauty to the Prince; whose compliment made her\r\nblush, and look more charming still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nA GREAT SCHEME, AND WHO BALKED IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs characters written with a secret ink come out with the application\r\nof fire, and disappear again and leave the paper white, as soon as it is\r\ncool; a hundred names of men, high in repute and favoring the Prince's\r\ncause, that were writ in our private lists, would have been visible\r\nenough on the great roll of the conspiracy, had it ever been laid open\r\nunder the sun. What crowds would have pressed forward, and subscribed\r\ntheir names and protested their loyalty, when the danger was over! What\r\na number of Whigs, now high in place and creatures of the all-powerful\r\nMinister, scorned Mr. Walpole then! If ever a match was gained by the\r\nmanliness and decision of a few at a moment of danger; if ever one was\r\nlost by the treachery and imbecility of those that had the cards in\r\ntheir hands, and might have played them, it was in that momentous game\r\nwhich was enacted in the next three days, and of which the noblest crown\r\nin the world was the stake.\r\n\r\nFrom the conduct of my Lord Bolingbroke, those who were interested\r\nin the scheme we had in hand, saw pretty well that he was not to be\r\ntrusted. Should the Prince prevail, it was his lordship's gracious\r\nintention to declare for him: should the Hanoverian party bring in their\r\nsovereign, who more ready to go on his knee, and cry, \xe2\x80\x9cGod Save King\r\nGeorge?\xe2\x80\x9d And he betrayed the one Prince and the other; but exactly at\r\nthe wrong time. When he should have struck for King James, he faltered\r\nand coquetted with the Whigs; and having committed himself by the most\r\nmonstrous professions of devotion, which the Elector rightly scorned,\r\nhe proved the justness of their contempt for him by flying and taking\r\nrenegade service with St. Germains, just when he should have kept\r\naloof: and that Court despised him, as the manly and resolute men who\r\nestablished the Elector in England had before done. He signed his own\r\nname to every accusation of insincerity his enemies made against him;\r\nand the King and the Pretender alike could show proofs of St. John's\r\ntreachery under his own hand and seal.\r\n\r\nOur friends kept a pretty close watch upon his motions, as on those of\r\nthe brave and hearty Whig party, that made little concealment of theirs.\r\nThey would have in the Elector, and used every means in their power to\r\neffect their end. My Lord Marlborough was now with them. His expulsion\r\nfrom power by the Tories had thrown that great captain at once on the\r\nWhig side. We heard he was coming from Antwerp; and, in fact, on the day\r\nof the Queen's death, he once more landed on English shore. A great part\r\nof the army was always with their illustrious leader; even the Tories\r\nin it were indignant at the injustice of the persecution which the Whig\r\nofficers were made to undergo. The chiefs of these were in London, and\r\nat the head of them one of the most intrepid men in the world, the Scots\r\nDuke of Argyle, whose conduct on the second day after that to which I\r\nhave now brought down my history, ended, as such honesty and bravery\r\ndeserved to end, by establishing the present Royal race on the English\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was no slight difference of opinion amongst the\r\ncouncillors surrounding the Prince, as to the plan his Highness should\r\npursue. His female Minister at Court, fancying she saw some amelioration\r\nin the Queen, was for waiting a few days, or hours it might be, until\r\nhe could be brought to her bedside, and acknowledged as her heir. Mr.\r\nEsmond was for having him march thither, escorted by a couple of troops\r\nof Horse Guards, and openly presenting himself to the Council. During\r\nthe whole of the night of the 29th-30th July, the Colonel was engaged\r\nwith gentlemen of the military profession, whom 'tis needless here to\r\nname; suffice it to say that several of them had exceeding high rank in\r\nthe army, and one of them in especial was a General, who, when he heard\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough was coming on the other side, waved his crutch\r\nover his head with a huzzah, at the idea that he should march out and\r\nengage him. Of the three Secretaries of State, we knew that one was\r\ndevoted to us. The Governor of the Tower was ours; the two companies\r\non duty at Kensington barrack were safe; and we had intelligence, very\r\nspeedy and accurate, of all that took place at the Palace within.\r\n\r\nAt noon, on the 30th of July, a message came to the Prince's friends\r\nthat the Committee of Council was sitting at Kensington Palace, their\r\nGraces of Ormonde and Shrewsbury, the Archbishop of Canterbury and\r\nthe three Secretaries of State, being there assembled. In an hour\r\nafterwards, hurried news was brought that the two great Whig Dukes,\r\nArgyle and Somerset, had broke into the Council-chamber without a\r\nsummons, and taken their seat at table. After holding a debate there,\r\nthe whole party proceeded to the chamber of the Queen, who was lying in\r\ngreat weakness, but still sensible, and the Lords recommended his Grace\r\nof Shrewsbury as the fittest person to take the vacant place of Lord\r\nTreasurer; her Majesty gave him the staff, as all know. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d writ\r\nmy messenger from Court, \xe2\x80\x9cNOW OR NEVER IS THE TIME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow or never was the time indeed. In spite of the Whig Dukes, our side\r\nhad still the majority in the Council, and Esmond, to whom the message\r\nhad been brought, (the personage at Court not being aware that the\r\nPrince had quitted his lodging in Kensington Square,) and Esmond's\r\ngallant young aide-de-camp, Frank Castlewood, putting on sword and\r\nuniform, took a brief leave of their dear lady, who embraced and blessed\r\nthem both, and went to her chamber to pray for the issue of the great\r\nevent which was then pending.\r\n\r\nCastlewood sped to the barrack to give warning to the captain of the\r\nGuard there; and then went to the \xe2\x80\x9cKing's Arms\xe2\x80\x9d tavern at Kensington,\r\nwhere our friends were assembled, having come by parties of twos\r\nand threes, riding or in coaches, and were got together in the upper\r\nchamber, fifty-three of them; their servants, who had been instructed to\r\nbring arms likewise, being below in the garden of the tavern, where they\r\nwere served with drink. Out of this garden is a little door that leads\r\ninto the road of the Palace, and through this it was arranged that\r\nmasters and servants were to march; when that signal was given, and that\r\nPersonage appeared, for whom all were waiting. There was in our company\r\nthe famous officer next in command to the Captain-General of the Forces,\r\nhis Grace the Duke of Ormonde, who was within at the Council. There\r\nwere with him two more lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals and\r\nbrigadiers, seven colonels, eleven Peers of Parliament, and twenty-one\r\nmembers of the House of Commons. The Guard was with us within and\r\nwithout the Palace: the Queen was with us; the Council (save the two\r\nWhig Dukes, that must have succumbed); the day was our own, and with a\r\nbeating heart Esmond walked rapidly to the Mall of Kensington, where\r\nhe had parted with the Prince on the night before. For three nights\r\nthe Colonel had not been to bed: the last had been passed summoning the\r\nPrince's friends together, of whom the great majority had no sort of\r\ninkling of the transaction pending until they were told that he was\r\nactually on the spot, and were summoned to strike the blow. The night\r\nbefore and after the altercation with the Prince, my gentleman, having\r\nsuspicions of his Royal Highness, and fearing lest he should be minded\r\nto give us the slip, and fly off after his fugitive beauty, had spent,\r\nif the truth must be told, at the \xe2\x80\x9cGreyhound\xe2\x80\x9d tavern, over against my\r\nLady Castlewood's house in Kensington Square, with an eye on the door,\r\nlest the Prince should escape from it. The night before that he had\r\npassed in his boots at the \xe2\x80\x9cCrown\xe2\x80\x9d at Hounslow, where he must watch\r\nforsooth all night, in order to get one moment's glimpse of Beatrix in\r\nthe morning. And fate had decreed that he was to have a fourth night's\r\nride and wakefulness before his business was ended.\r\n\r\nHe ran to the curate's house in Kensington Mall, and asked for Mr.\r\nBates, the name the Prince went by. The curate's wife said Mr. Bates had\r\ngone abroad very early in the morning in his boots, saying he was going\r\nto the Bishop of Rochester's house at Chelsey. But the Bishop had been\r\nat Kensington himself two hours ago to seek for Mr. Bates, and had\r\nreturned in his coach to his own house, when he heard that the gentleman\r\nwas gone thither to seek him.\r\n\r\nThis absence was most unpropitious, for an hour's delay might cost a\r\nkingdom; Esmond had nothing for it but to hasten to the \xe2\x80\x9cKing's Arms,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and tell the gentlemen there assembled that Mr. George (as we called the\r\nPrince there) was not at home, but that Esmond would go fetch him; and\r\ntaking a General's coach that happened to be there, Esmond drove across\r\nthe country to Chelsey, to the Bishop's house there.\r\n\r\nThe porter said two gentlemen were with his lordship, and Esmond ran\r\npast this sentry up to the locked door of the Bishop's study, at which\r\nhe rattled, and was admitted presently. Of the Bishop's guests one was a\r\nbrother prelate, and the other the Abbe G----.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr. George?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond; \xe2\x80\x9cnow is the time.\xe2\x80\x9d The Bishop\r\nlooked scared: \xe2\x80\x9cI went to his lodging,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they told me he\r\nwas come hither. I returned as quick as coach would carry me; and he\r\nhath not been here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel burst out with an oath; that was all he could say to their\r\nreverences; ran down the stairs again, and bidding the coachman, an old\r\nfriend and fellow-campaigner, drive as if he was charging the French\r\nwith his master at Wynendael--they were back at Kensington in half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nAgain Esmond went to the curate's house. Mr. Bates had not returned. The\r\nColonel had to go with this blank errand to the gentlemen at the \xe2\x80\x9cKing's\r\nArms,\xe2\x80\x9d that were grown very impatient by this time.\r\n\r\nOut of the window of the tavern, and looking over the garden wall, you\r\ncan see the green before Kensington Palace, the Palace gate (round which\r\nthe Ministers' coaches were standing), and the barrack building. As\r\nwe were looking out from this window in gloomy discourse, we heard\r\npresently trumpets blowing, and some of us ran to the window of the\r\nfront-room, looking into the High Street of Kensington, and saw a\r\nregiment of Horse coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's Ormonde's Guards,\xe2\x80\x9d says one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, by God, it's Argyle's old regiment!\xe2\x80\x9d says my General, clapping down\r\nhis crutch.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, Argyle's regiment that was brought from Westminster,\r\nand that took the place of the regiment at Kensington on which we could\r\nrely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Harry!\xe2\x80\x9d says one of the generals there present, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were born\r\nunder an unlucky star; I begin to think that there's no Mr. George, nor\r\nMr. Dragon either. 'Tis not the peerage I care for, for our name is so\r\nancient and famous, that merely to be called Lord Lydiard would do me no\r\ngood; but 'tis the chance you promised me of fighting Marlborough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we were talking, Castlewood entered the room with a disturbed air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat news, Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. George coming at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn him, look here!\xe2\x80\x9d says Castlewood, holding out a paper. \xe2\x80\x9cI found\r\nit in the book--the what you call it, 'Eikum Basilikum,'--that villain\r\nMartin put it there--he said his young mistress bade him. It was\r\ndirected to me, but it was meant for him I know, and I broke the seal\r\nand read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole assembly of officers seemed to swim away before Esmond's eyes\r\nas he read the paper; all that was written on it was:--\xe2\x80\x9cBeatrix Esmond\r\nis sent away to prison, to Castlewood, where she will pray for happier\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you guess where he is?\xe2\x80\x9d says Castlewood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel Esmond. He knew full well, Frank knew full well: our\r\ninstinct told whither that traitor had fled.\r\n\r\nHe had courage to turn to the company and say, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I fear\r\nvery much that Mr. George will not be here to-day; something hath\r\nhappened--and--and--I very much fear some accident may befall him, which\r\nmust keep him out of the way. Having had your noon's draught, you had\r\nbest pay the reckoning and go home; there can be no game where there is\r\nno one to play it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome of the gentlemen went away without a word, others called to pay\r\ntheir duty to her Majesty and ask for her health. The little army\r\ndisappeared into the darkness out of which it had been called; there had\r\nbeen no writings, no paper to implicate any man. Some few officers and\r\nMembers of Parliament had been invited over night to breakfast at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKing's Arms,\xe2\x80\x9d at Kensington; and they had called for their bill and\r\ngone home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1ST, 1714.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes my mistress know of this?\xe2\x80\x9d Esmond asked of Frank, as they walked\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother found the letter in the book, on the toilet-table. She had\r\nwrit it ere she had left home,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank said. \xe2\x80\x9cMother met her on the\r\nstairs, with her hand upon the door, trying to enter, and never left her\r\nafter that till she went away. He did not think of looking at it there,\r\nnor had Martin the chance of telling him. I believe the poor devil meant\r\nno harm, though I half killed him; he thought 'twas to Beatrix's brother\r\nhe was bringing the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank never said a word of reproach to me for having brought the villain\r\namongst us. As we knocked at the door I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will the horses be\r\nready?\xe2\x80\x9d Frank pointed with his cane, they were turning the street that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nWe went up and bade adieu to our mistress; she was in a dreadful state\r\nof agitation by this time, and that Bishop was with her whose company\r\nshe was so fond of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you tell him, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Beatrix was at\r\nCastlewood?\xe2\x80\x9d The Bishop blushed and stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou served the villain right,\xe2\x80\x9d broke out Mr. Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cand he has lost a\r\ncrown by what you told him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mistress turned quite white, \xe2\x80\x9cHenry, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not kill\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may not be too late,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond; \xe2\x80\x9che may not have gone to\r\nCastlewood; pray God, it is not too late.\xe2\x80\x9d The Bishop was breaking\r\nout with some banale phrases about loyalty, and the sacredness of the\r\nSovereign's person; but Esmond sternly bade him hold his tongue, burn\r\nall papers, and take care of Lady Castlewood; and in five minutes he\r\nand Frank were in the saddle, John Lockwood behind them, riding towards\r\nCastlewood at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\nWe were just got to Alton, when who should meet us but old Lockwood, the\r\nporter from Castlewood, John's father, walking by the side of the Hexton\r\nflying-coach, who slept the night at Alton. Lockwood said his young\r\nmistress had arrived at home on Wednesday night, and this morning,\r\nFriday, had despatched him with a packet for my lady at Kensington,\r\nsaying the letter was of great importance.\r\n\r\nWe took the freedom to break it, while Lockwood stared with wonder,\r\nand cried out his \xe2\x80\x9cLord bless me's,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWho'd a thought it's,\xe2\x80\x9d at the\r\nsight of his young lord, whom he had not seen these seven years.\r\n\r\nThe packet from Beatrix contained no news of importance at all. It was\r\nwritten in a jocular strain, affecting to make light of her captivity.\r\nShe asked whether she might have leave to visit Mrs. Tusher, or to walk\r\nbeyond the court and the garden wall. She gave news of the peacocks,\r\nand a fawn she had there. She bade her mother send her certain gowns\r\nand smocks by old Lockwood; she sent her duty to a certain Person, if\r\ncertain other persons permitted her to take such a freedom; how that,\r\nas she was not able to play cards with him, she hoped he would read good\r\nbooks, such as Doctor Atterbury's sermons and \xe2\x80\x9cEikon Basilike:\xe2\x80\x9d she was\r\ngoing to read good books; she thought her pretty mamma would like to\r\nknow she was not crying her eyes out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is in the house besides you, Lockwood?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere be the laundry-maid, and the kitchen-maid, Madam Beatrix's maid,\r\nthe man from London, and that be all; and he sleepeth in my lodge away\r\nfrom the maids,\xe2\x80\x9d says old Lockwood.\r\n\r\nEsmond scribbled a line with a pencil on the note, giving it to the old\r\nman, and bidding him go on to his lady. We knew why Beatrix had been\r\nso dutiful on a sudden, and why she spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cEikon Basilike.\xe2\x80\x9d She writ\r\nthis letter to put the Prince on the scent, and the porter out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a fine moonlight night for riding on,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond; \xe2\x80\x9cFrank, we\r\nmay reach Castlewood in time yet.\xe2\x80\x9d All the way along they made inquiries\r\nat the post-houses, when a tall young gentleman in a gray suit, with a\r\nlight brown periwig, just the color of my lord's, had been seen to pass.\r\nHe had set off at six that morning, and we at three in the afternoon. He\r\nrode almost as quickly as we had done; he was seven hours a-head of us\r\nstill when we reached the last stage.\r\n\r\nWe rode over Castlewood Downs before the breaking of dawn. We passed the\r\nvery spot where the car was upset fourteen years since, and Mohun lay.\r\nThe village was not up yet, nor the forge lighted, as we rode through\r\nit, passing by the elms, where the rooks were still roosting, and by\r\nthe church, and over the bridge. We got off our horses at the bridge and\r\nwalked up to the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she is safe,\xe2\x80\x9d says Frank, trembling, and his honest eyes filling\r\nwith tears, \xe2\x80\x9ca silver statue to Our Lady!\xe2\x80\x9d He was going to rattle at\r\nthe great iron knocker on the oak gate; but Esmond stopped his kinsman's\r\nhand. He had his own fears, his own hopes, his own despairs and griefs,\r\ntoo; but he spoke not a word of these to his companion, or showed any\r\nsigns of emotion.\r\n\r\nHe went and tapped at the little window at the porter's lodge, gently,\r\nbut repeatedly, until the man came to the bars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho's there?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, looking out; it was the servant from Kensington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord Castlewood and Colonel Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, from below. \xe2\x80\x9cOpen the\r\ngate and let us in without any noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord Castlewood?\xe2\x80\x9d says the other; \xe2\x80\x9cmy lord's here, and in bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen, d--n you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Castlewood, with a curse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall open to no one,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man, shutting the glass window as\r\nFrank drew a pistol. He would have fired at the porter, but Esmond again\r\nheld his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are more ways than one,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cof entering such a great house\r\nas this.\xe2\x80\x9d Frank grumbled that the west gate was half a mile round. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nI know of a way that's not a hundred yards off,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Esmond; and\r\nleading his kinsman close along the wall, and by the shrubs which had\r\nnow grown thick on what had been an old moat about the house, they came\r\nto the buttress, at the side of which the little window was, which was\r\nFather Holt's private door. Esmond climbed up to this easily, broke a\r\npane that had been mended, and touched the spring inside, and the two\r\ngentlemen passed in that way, treading as lightly as they could; and so\r\ngoing through the passage into the court, over which the dawn was now\r\nreddening, and where the fountain plashed in the silence.\r\n\r\nThey sped instantly to the porter's lodge, where the fellow had not\r\nfastened his door that led into the court; and pistol in hand came\r\nupon the terrified wretch, and bade him be silent. Then they asked\r\nhim (Esmond's head reeled, and he almost fell as he spoke) when Lord\r\nCastlewood had arrived? He said on the previous evening, about eight of\r\nthe clock.--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what then?\xe2\x80\x9d--His lordship supped with his sister.--\xe2\x80\x9cDid\r\nthe man wait?\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, he and my lady's maid both waited: the other\r\nservants made the supper; and there was no wine, and they could give\r\nhis lordship but milk, at which he grumbled; and--and Madam Beatrix kept\r\nMiss Lucy always in the room with her. And there being a bed across\r\nthe court in the Chaplain's room, she had arranged my lord was to sleep\r\nthere. Madam Beatrix had come down stairs laughing with the maids, and\r\nhad locked herself in, and my lord had stood for a while talking to her\r\nthrough the door, and she laughing at him. And then he paced the court\r\nawhile, and she came again to the upper window; and my lord implored her\r\nto come down and walk in the room; but she would not, and laughed at him\r\nagain, and shut the window; and so my lord, uttering what seemed curses,\r\nbut in a foreign language, went to the Chaplain's room to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas this all!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cAll,\xe2\x80\x9d the man swore upon his honor; all as he hoped\r\nto be saved.--\xe2\x80\x9cStop, there was one thing more. My lord, on arriving, and\r\nonce or twice during supper, did kiss his sister, as was natural, and\r\nshe kissed him.\xe2\x80\x9d At this Esmond ground his teeth with rage, and wellnigh\r\nthrottled the amazed miscreant who was speaking, whereas Castlewood,\r\nseizing hold of his cousin's hand, burst into a great fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it amuses thee,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond in French, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your sister should be\r\nexchanging of kisses with a stranger, I fear poor Beatrix will give thee\r\nplenty of sport.\xe2\x80\x9d--Esmond darkly thought, how Hamilton, Ashburnham, had\r\nbefore been masters of those roses that the young Prince's lips were now\r\nfeeding on. He sickened at that notion. Her cheek was desecrated, her\r\nbeauty tarnished; shame and honor stood between it and him. The love\r\nwas dead within him; had she a crown to bring him with her love, he felt\r\nthat both would degrade him.\r\n\r\nBut this wrath against Beatrix did not lessen the angry feelings of the\r\nColonel against the man who had been the occasion if not the cause of\r\nthe evil. Frank sat down on a stone bench in the court-yard, and fairly\r\nfell asleep, while Esmond paced up and down the court, debating what\r\nshould ensue. What mattered how much or how little had passed between\r\nthe Prince and the poor faithless girl? They were arrived in time\r\nperhaps to rescue her person, but not her mind; had she not instigated\r\nthe young Prince to come to her; suborned servants, dismissed others,\r\nso that she might communicate with him? The treacherous heart within her\r\nhad surrendered, though the place was safe; and it was to win this that\r\nhe had given a life's struggle and devotion; this, that she was ready to\r\ngive away for the bribe of a coronet or a wink of the Prince's eye.\r\n\r\nWhen he had thought his thoughts out he shook up poor Frank from his\r\nsleep, who rose yawning, and said he had been dreaming of Clotilda.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must back me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cin what I am going to do. I have been\r\nthinking that yonder scoundrel may have been instructed to tell that\r\nstory, and that the whole of it may be a lie; if it be, we shall find it\r\nout from the gentleman who is asleep yonder. See if the door leading to\r\nmy lady's rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d (so we called the rooms at the north-west angle of the\r\nhouse,) \xe2\x80\x9csee if the door is barred as he saith.\xe2\x80\x9d We tried; it was indeed\r\nas the lackey had said, closed within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may have been opened and shut afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d says poor Esmond; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nfoundress of our family let our ancestor in in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do, Harry, if--if what that fellow saith should turn out\r\nuntrue?\xe2\x80\x9d The young man looked scared and frightened into his kinsman's\r\nface; I dare say it wore no very pleasant expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us first go see whether the two stories agree,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond; and\r\nwent in at the passage and opened the door into what had been his own\r\nchamber now for wellnigh five-and-twenty years. A candle was still\r\nburning, and the Prince asleep dressed on the bed--Esmond did not care\r\nfor making a noise. The Prince started up in his bed, seeing two men\r\nin his chamber. \xe2\x80\x9cQui est la\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and took a pistol from under his\r\npillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the Marquis of Esmond,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9ccome to welcome his\r\nMajesty to his house of Castlewood, and to report of what hath happened\r\nin London. Pursuant to the King's orders, I passed the night before\r\nlast, after leaving his Majesty, in waiting upon the friends of the\r\nKing. It is a pity that his Majesty's desire to see the country and to\r\nvisit our poor house should have caused the King to quit London without\r\nnotice yesterday, when the opportunity happened which in all human\r\nprobability may not occur again; and had the King not chosen to ride to\r\nCastlewood, the Prince of Wales might have slept at St. James's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Sdeath! gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince, starting off his bed, whereon he\r\nwas lying in his clothes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Doctor was with me yesterday morning, and\r\nafter watching by my sister all night, told me I might not hope to see\r\nthe Queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond with another bow; \xe2\x80\x9cas, by\r\nthis time, the Queen may be dead in spite of the Doctor. The Council\r\nwas met, a new Treasurer was appointed, the troops were devoted to the\r\nKing's cause; and fifty loyal gentlemen of the greatest names of this\r\nkingdom were assembled to accompany the Prince of Wales, who might have\r\nbeen the acknowledged heir of the throne, or the possessor of it by this\r\ntime, had your Majesty not chosen to take the air. We were ready; there\r\nwas only one person that failed us, your Majesty's gracious--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorbleu, Monsieur, you give me too much Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, who\r\nhad now risen up and seemed to be looking to one of us to help him to\r\nhis coat. But neither stirred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall take care,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond, \xe2\x80\x9cnot much oftener to offend in that\r\nparticular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mean you, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince, and muttered something about\r\na guet-a-pens, which Esmond caught up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe snare, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not of our laying; it is not we that\r\ninvited you. We came to avenge, and not to compass, the dishonor of our\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDishonor! Morbleu, there has been no dishonor,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince,\r\nturning scarlet, \xe2\x80\x9conly a little harmless playing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was meant to end seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear,\xe2\x80\x9d the Prince broke out impetuously, \xe2\x80\x9cupon the honor of a\r\ngentleman, my lords--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we arrived in time. No wrong hath been done, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colonel\r\nEsmond, turning round to young Castlewood, who stood at the door as the\r\ntalk was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cSee! here is a paper whereon his Majesty has deigned\r\nto commence some verses in honor, or dishonor, of Beatrix. Here is\r\n'Madame' and 'Flamme,' 'Cruelle' and 'Rebelle,' and 'Amour' and 'Jour'\r\nin the Royal writing and spelling. Had the Gracious lover been happy,\r\nhe had not passed his time in sighing.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, and actually as he was\r\nspeaking, Esmond cast his eyes down towards the table, and saw a paper\r\non which my young Prince had been scrawling a madrigal, that was to\r\nfinish his charmer on the morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince, burning with rage (he had assumed his Royal coat\r\nunassisted by this time), \xe2\x80\x9cdid I come here to receive insults?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo confer them, may it please your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel, with a\r\nvery low bow, \xe2\x80\x9cand the gentlemen of our family are come to thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMalediction!\xe2\x80\x9d says the young man, tears starting into his eyes with\r\nhelpless rage and mortification. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you with me, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your Majesty will please to enter the next apartment,\xe2\x80\x9d says Esmond,\r\npreserving his grave tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI have some papers there which I would\r\ngladly submit to you, and by your permission I will lead the way;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and, taking the taper up, and backing before the Prince with very great\r\nceremony, Mr. Esmond passed into the little Chaplain's room, through\r\nwhich we had just entered into the house:--\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to set a chair for\r\nhis Majesty, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel to his companion, who wondered\r\nalmost as much at this scene, and was as much puzzled by it, as the\r\nother actor in it. Then going to the crypt over the mantel-piece, the\r\nColonel opened it, and drew thence the papers which so long had lain\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, may it please your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cis the Patent of Marquis\r\nsent over by your Royal Father at St. Germains to Viscount Castlewood,\r\nmy father: here is the witnessed certificate of my father's marriage\r\nto my mother, and of my birth and christening; I was christened of that\r\nreligion of which your sainted sire gave all through life so shining\r\nexample. These are my titles, dear Frank, and this what I do with them:\r\nhere go Baptism and Marriage, and here the Marquisate and the August\r\nSign-Manual, with which your predecessor was pleased to honor our race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And as Esmond spoke he set the papers burning in the brazier. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will\r\nplease, sir, to remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our family hath ruined\r\nitself by fidelity to yours: that my grandfather spent his estate, and\r\ngave his blood and his son to die for your service; that my dear lord's\r\ngrandfather (for lord you are now, Frank, by right and title too) died\r\nfor the same cause; that my poor kinswoman, my father's second wife,\r\nafter giving away her honor to your wicked perjured race, sent all her\r\nwealth to the King; and got in return, that precious title that lies in\r\nashes, and this inestimable yard of blue ribbon. I lay this at your feet\r\nand stamp upon it: I draw this sword, and break it and deny you; and,\r\nhad you completed the wrong you designed us, by heaven I would have\r\ndriven it through your heart, and no more pardoned you than your father\r\npardoned Monmouth. Frank will do the same, won't you, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank, who had been looking on with a stupid air at the papers, as they\r\nflamed in the old brazier, took out his sword and broke it, holding his\r\nhead down:--\xe2\x80\x9cI go with my cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, giving Esmond a grasp of\r\nthe hand. \xe2\x80\x9cMarquis or not, by ---, I stand by him any day. I beg your\r\nMajesty's pardon for swearing; that is--that is--I'm for the Elector of\r\nHanover. It's all your Majesty's own fault. The Queen's dead most likely\r\nby this time. And you might have been King if you hadn't come dangling\r\nafter Trix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus to lose a crown,\xe2\x80\x9d says the young Prince, starting up, and speaking\r\nFrench in his eager way; \xe2\x80\x9cto lose the loveliest woman in the world; to\r\nlose the loyalty of such hearts as yours, is not this, my lords, enough\r\nof humiliation?--Marquis, if I go on my knees will you pardon me?--No,\r\nI can't do that, but I can offer you reparation, that of honor, that\r\nof gentlemen. Favor me by crossing the sword with mine: yours is\r\nbroke--see, yonder in the armoire are two;\xe2\x80\x9d and the Prince took them out\r\nas eager as a boy, and held them towards Esmond:--\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you will? Merci,\r\nmonsieur, merci!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExtremely touched by this immense mark of condescension and repentance\r\nfor wrong done, Colonel Esmond bowed down so low as almost to kiss the\r\ngracious young hand that conferred on him such an honor, and took his\r\nguard in silence. The swords were no sooner met, than Castlewood knocked\r\nup Esmond's with the blade of his own, which he had broke off short at\r\nthe shell; and the Colonel falling back a step dropped his point with\r\nanother very low bow, and declared himself perfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh bien, Vicomte!\xe2\x80\x9d says the young Prince, who was a boy, and a French\r\nboy, \xe2\x80\x9cil ne nous reste qu'une chose a faire:\xe2\x80\x9d he placed his sword upon\r\nthe table, and the fingers of his two hands upon his breast:--\xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\none more thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou do not divine it?\xe2\x80\x9d He stretched out\r\nhis arms:--\xe2\x80\x9cEmbrassons nous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe talk was scarce over when Beatrix entered the room:--What came she\r\nto seek there? She started and turned pale at the sight of her\r\nbrother and kinsman, drawn swords, broken sword-blades, and papers yet\r\nsmouldering in the brazier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming Beatrix,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Prince, with a blush which became him very\r\nwell, \xe2\x80\x9cthese lords have come a-horseback from London, where my sister\r\nlies in a despaired state, and where her successor makes himself\r\ndesired. Pardon me for my escapade of last evening. I had been so long a\r\nprisoner, that I seized the occasion of a promenade on horseback, and my\r\nhorse naturally bore me towards you. I found you a Queen in your little\r\ncourt, where you deigned to entertain me. Present my homages to your\r\nmaids of honor. I sighed as you slept, under the window of your chamber,\r\nand then retired to seek rest in my own. It was there that these\r\ngentlemen agreeably roused me. Yes, milords, for that is a happy day\r\nthat makes a Prince acquainted, at whatever cost to his vanity, with\r\nsuch a noble heart as that of the Marquis of Esmond. Mademoiselle,\r\nmay we take your coach to town? I saw it in the hangar, and this poor\r\nMarquis must be dropping with sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it please the King to breakfast before he goes?\xe2\x80\x9d was all Beatrix\r\ncould say. The roses had shuddered out of her cheeks; her eyes were\r\nglaring; she looked quite old. She came up to Esmond and hissed out a\r\nword or two:--\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did not love you before, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cthink\r\nhow I love you now.\xe2\x80\x9d If words could stab, no doubt she would have killed\r\nEsmond; she looked at him as if she could.\r\n\r\nBut her keen words gave no wound to Mr. Esmond; his heart was too hard.\r\nAs he looked at her, he wondered that he could ever have loved her.\r\nHis love of ten years was over; it fell down dead on the spot, at\r\nthe Kensington Tavern, where Frank brought him the note out of \xe2\x80\x9cEikon\r\nBasilike.\xe2\x80\x9d The Prince blushed and bowed low, as she gazed at him, and\r\nquitted the chamber. I have never seen her from that day.\r\n\r\nHorses were fetched and put to the chariot presently. My lord rode\r\noutside, and as for Esmond he was so tired that he was no sooner in the\r\ncarriage than he fell asleep, and never woke till night, as the coach\r\ncame into Alton.\r\n\r\nAs we drove to the \xe2\x80\x9cBell\xe2\x80\x9d Inn comes a mitred coach with our old friend\r\nLockwood beside the coachman. My Lady Castlewood and the Bishop were\r\ninside; she gave a little scream when she saw us. The two coaches\r\nentered the inn almost together; the landlord and people coming out with\r\nlights to welcome the visitors.\r\n\r\nWe in our coach sprang out of it, as soon as ever we saw the dear lady,\r\nand above all, the Doctor in his cassock. What was the news? Was there\r\nyet time? Was the Queen alive? These questions were put hurriedly, as\r\nBoniface stood waiting before his noble guests to bow them up the stair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she safe?\xe2\x80\x9d was what Lady Castlewood whispered in a flutter to\r\nEsmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll's well, thank God,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, as the fond lady took his hand\r\nand kissed it, and called him her preserver and her dear. SHE wasn't\r\nthinking of Queens and crowns.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop's news was reassuring: at least all was not lost; the Queen\r\nyet breathed, or was alive when they left London, six hours since. (\xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas Lady Castlewood who insisted on coming,\xe2\x80\x9d the Doctor said.) Argyle\r\nhad marched up regiments from Portsmouth, and sent abroad for more; the\r\nWhigs were on the alert, a pest on them, (I am not sure but the Bishop\r\nswore as he spoke,) and so too were our people. And all might be saved,\r\nif only the Prince could be at London in time. We called for horses,\r\ninstantly to return to London. We never went up poor crestfallen\r\nBoniface's stairs, but into our coaches again. The Prince and his Prime\r\nMinister in one, Esmond in the other, with only his dear mistress as a\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nCastlewood galloped forwards on horseback to gather the Prince's friends\r\nand warn them of his coming. We travelled through the night. Esmond\r\ndiscoursing to his mistress of the events of the last twenty-four hours;\r\nof Castlewood's ride and his; of the Prince's generous behavior and\r\ntheir reconciliation. The night seemed short enough; and the starlit\r\nhours passed away serenely in that fond company.\r\n\r\nSo we came along the road; the Bishop's coach heading ours; and, with\r\nsome delays in procuring horses, we got to Hammersmith about four\r\no'clock on Sunday morning, the first of August, and half an hour after,\r\nit being then bright day, we rode by my Lady Warwick's house, and so\r\ndown the street of Kensington.\r\n\r\nEarly as the hour was, there was a bustle in the street and many people\r\nmoving to and fro. Round the gate leading to the Palace, where the\r\nguard is, there was especially a great crowd. And the coach ahead of us\r\nstopped, and the Bishop's man got down to know what the concourse meant?\r\n\r\nThere presently came from out of the gate--Horse Guards with their\r\ntrumpets, and a company of heralds with their tabards. The trumpets\r\nblew, and the herald-at-arms came forward and proclaimed GEORGE, by the\r\nGrace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of\r\nthe Faith. And the people shouted God save the King!\r\n\r\nAmong the crowd shouting and waving their hats, I caught sight of one\r\nsad face, which I had known all my life, and seen under many disguises.\r\nIt was no other than poor Mr. Holt's, who had slipped over to England\r\nto witness the triumph of the good cause; and now beheld its enemies\r\nvictorious, amidst the acclamations of the English people. The poor\r\nfellow had forgot to huzzah or to take his hat off, until his neighbors\r\nin the crowd remarked his want of loyalty, and cursed him for a Jesuit\r\nin disguise, when he ruefully uncovered and began to cheer. Sure he\r\nwas the most unlucky of men: he never played a game but he lost it; or\r\nengaged in a conspiracy but 'twas certain to end in defeat. I saw him in\r\nFlanders after this, whence he went to Rome to the head-quarters of his\r\nOrder; and actually reappeared among us in America, very old, and\r\nbusy, and hopeful. I am not sure that he did not assume the hatchet and\r\nmoccasins there; and, attired in a blanket and war-paint, skulk about\r\na missionary amongst the Indians. He lies buried in our neighboring\r\nprovince of Maryland now, with a cross over him, and a mound of earth\r\nabove him; under which that unquiet spirit is for ever at peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the sound of King George's trumpets, all the vain hopes of the weak\r\nand foolish young Pretender were blown away; and with that music, too, I\r\nmay say, the drama of my own life was ended. That happiness, which hath\r\nsubsequently crowned it, cannot be written in words; 'tis of its nature\r\nsacred and secret, and not to be spoken of, though the heart be ever so\r\nfull of thankfulness, save to Heaven and the One Ear alone--to one fond\r\nbeing, the truest and tenderest and purest wife ever man was blessed\r\nwith. As I think of the immense happiness which was in store for me, and\r\nof the depth and intensity of that love which, for so many years, hath\r\nblessed me, I own to a transport of wonder and gratitude for such a\r\nboon--nay, am thankful to have been endowed with a heart capable of\r\nfeeling and knowing the immense beauty and value of the gift which God\r\nhath bestowed upon me. Sure, love vincit omnia; is immeasurably above\r\nall ambition, more precious than wealth, more noble than name. He knows\r\nnot life who knows not that: he hath not felt the highest faculty of\r\nthe soul who hath not enjoyed it. In the name of my wife I write the\r\ncompletion of hope, and the summit of happiness. To have such a love is\r\nthe one blessing, in comparison of which all earthly joy is of no value;\r\nand to think of her, is to praise God.\r\n\r\nIt was at Bruxelles, whither we retreated after the failure of our\r\nplot--our Whig friends advising us to keep out of the way--that the\r\ngreat joy of my life was bestowed upon me, and that my dear mistress\r\nbecame my wife. We had been so accustomed to an extreme intimacy and\r\nconfidence, and had lived so long and tenderly together, that we\r\nmight have gone on to the end without thinking of a closer tie; but\r\ncircumstances brought about that event which so prodigiously multiplied\r\nmy happiness and hers (for which I humbly thank Heaven), although a\r\ncalamity befell us, which, I blush to think, hath occurred more than\r\nonce in our house. I know not what infatuation of ambition urged the\r\nbeautiful and wayward woman, whose name hath occupied so many of these\r\npages, and who was served by me with ten years of such constant fidelity\r\nand passion; but ever after that day at Castlewood, when we rescued her,\r\nshe persisted in holding all her family as her enemies, and left us, and\r\nescaped to France, to what a fate I disdain to tell. Nor was her son's\r\nhouse a home for my dear mistress; my poor Frank was weak, as perhaps\r\nall our race hath been, and led by women. Those around him were\r\nimperious, and in a terror of his mother's influence over him, lest\r\nhe should recant, and deny the creed which he had adopted by their\r\npersuasion. The difference of their religion separated the son and the\r\nmother: my dearest mistress felt that she was severed from her children\r\nand alone in the world--alone but for one constant servant on whose\r\nfidelity, praised be Heaven, she could count. 'Twas after a scene of\r\nignoble quarrel on the part of Frank's wife and mother (for the poor lad\r\nhad been made to marry the whole of that German family with whom he had\r\nconnected himself), that I found my mistress one day in tears, and then\r\nbesought her to confide herself to the care and devotion of one who,\r\nby God's help, would never forsake her. And then the tender matron, as\r\nbeautiful in her Autumn, and as pure as virgins in their spring, with\r\nblushes of love and \xe2\x80\x9ceyes of meek surrender,\xe2\x80\x9d yielded to my respectful\r\nimportunity, and consented to share my home. Let the last words I write\r\nthank her, and bless her who hath blessed it.\r\n\r\nBy the kindness of Mr. Addison, all danger of prosecution, and every\r\nobstacle against our return to England, was removed; and my son Frank's\r\ngallantry in Scotland made his peace with the King's government. But we\r\ntwo cared no longer to live in England: and Frank formally and joyfully\r\nyielded over to us the possession of that estate which we now occupy,\r\nfar away from Europe and its troubles, on the beautiful banks of the\r\nPotomac, where we have built a new Castlewood, and think with grateful\r\nhearts of our old home. In our Transatlantic country we have a season,\r\nthe calmest and most delightful of the year, which we call the Indian\r\nsummer: I often say the autumn of our life resembles that happy and\r\nserene weather, and am thankful for its rest and its sweet sunshine.\r\nHeaven hath blessed us with a child, which each parent loves for her\r\nresemblance to the other. Our diamonds are turned into ploughs and axes\r\nfor our plantations; and into negroes, the happiest and merriest, I\r\nthink, in all this country: and the only jewel by which my wife sets\r\nany store, and from which she hath never parted, is that gold button she\r\ntook from my arm on the day when she visited me in prison, and which she\r\nwore ever after, as she told me, on the tenderest heart in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The History of Henry Esmond, Esq., by\r\nW.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
