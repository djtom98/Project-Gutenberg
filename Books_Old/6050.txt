OF BURGSTEAD AND ITS FOLK AND ITS NEIGHBOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nONCE upon a time amidst the mountains and hills and falling streams of a\r\nfair land there was a town or thorp in a certain valley.  This was\r\nwell-nigh encompassed by a wall of sheer cliffs; toward the East and the\r\ngreat mountains they drew together till they went near to meet, and left\r\nbut a narrow path on either side of a stony stream that came rattling\r\ndown into the Dale: toward the river at that end the hills lowered\r\nsomewhat, though they still ended in sheer rocks; but up from it, and\r\nmore especially on the north side, they swelled into great shoulders of\r\nland, then dipped a little, and rose again into the sides of huge fells\r\nclad with pine-woods, and cleft here and there by deep ghylls: thence\r\nagain they rose higher and steeper, and ever higher till they drew dark\r\nand naked out of the woods to meet the snow-fields and ice-rivers of the\r\nhigh mountains.  But that was far away from the pass by the little river\r\ninto the valley; and the said river was no drain from the snow-fields\r\nwhite and thick with the grinding of the ice, but clear and bright were\r\nits waters that came from wells amidst the bare rocky heaths.\r\n\r\nThe upper end of the valley, where it first began to open out from the\r\npass, was rugged and broken by rocks and ridges of water-borne stones,\r\nbut presently it smoothed itself into mere grassy swellings and knolls,\r\nand at last into a fair and fertile plain swelling up into a green wave,\r\nas it were, against the rock-wall which encompassed it on all sides save\r\nwhere the river came gushing out of the strait pass at the east end, and\r\nwhere at the west end it poured itself out of the Dale toward the\r\nlowlands and the plain of the great river.\r\n\r\nNow the valley was some ten miles of our measure from that place of the\r\nrocks and the stone-ridges, to where the faces of the hills drew somewhat\r\nanigh to the river again at the west, and then fell aback along the edge\r\nof the great plain; like as when ye fare a-sailing past two nesses of a\r\nriver-mouth, and the main-sea lieth open before you.\r\n\r\nBesides the river afore-mentioned, which men called the Weltering Water,\r\nthere were other waters in the Dale.  Near the eastern pass, entangled in\r\nthe rocky ground was a deep tarn full of cold springs and about two acres\r\nin measure, and therefrom ran a stream which fell into the Weltering\r\nWater amidst the grassy knolls.  Black seemed the waters of that tarn\r\nwhich on one side washed the rocks-wall of the Dale; ugly and aweful it\r\nseemed to men, and none knew what lay beneath its waters save black\r\nmis-shapen trouts that few cared to bring to net or angle: and it was\r\ncalled the Death-Tarn.\r\n\r\nOther waters yet there were: here and there from the hills on both sides,\r\nbut especially from the south side, came trickles of water that ran in\r\npretty brooks down to the river; and some of these sprang bubbling up\r\namidst the foot-mounds of the sheer-rocks; some had cleft a rugged and\r\nstrait way through them, and came tumbling down into the Dale at diverse\r\nheights from their faces.  But on the north side about halfway down the\r\nDale, one stream somewhat bigger than the others, and dealing with softer\r\nground, had cleft for itself a wider way; and the folk had laboured this\r\nway wider yet, till they had made them a road running north along the\r\nwest side of the stream.  Sooth to say, except for the strait pass along\r\nthe river at the eastern end, and the wider pass at the western, they had\r\nno other way (save one of which a word anon) out of the Dale but such as\r\nmountain goats and bold cragsmen might take; and even of these but few.\r\n\r\nThis midway stream was called the Wildlake, and the way along it\r\nWildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way, because it came to them out of the wood, which on that\r\nnorth side stretched away from nigh to the lip of the valley-wall up to\r\nthe pine woods and the high fells on the east and north, and down to the\r\nplain country on the west and south.\r\n\r\nNow when the Weltering Water came out of the rocky tangle near the pass,\r\nit was turned aside by the ground till it swung right up to the feet of\r\nthe Southern crags; then it turned and slowly bent round again northward,\r\nand at last fairly doubled back on itself before it turned again to run\r\nwestward; so that when, after its second double, it had come to flowing\r\nsoftly westward under the northern crags, it had cast two thirds of a\r\ngirdle round about a space of land a little below the grassy knolls and\r\ntofts aforesaid; and there in that fair space between the folds of the\r\nWeltering Water stood the Thorp whereof the tale hath told.\r\n\r\nThe men thereof had widened and deepened the Weltering Water about them,\r\nand had bridged it over to the plain meads; and athwart the throat of the\r\nspace left clear by the water they had built them a strong wall though\r\nnot very high, with a gate amidst and a tower on either side thereof.\r\nMoreover, on the face of the cliff which was but a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw from the\r\ngate they had made them stairs and ladders to go up by; and on a knoll\r\nnigh the brow had built a watch-tower of stone strong and great, lest war\r\nshould come into the land from over the hills.  That tower was ancient,\r\nand therefrom the Thorp had its name and the whole valley also; and it\r\nwas called Burgstead in Burgdale.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Weltering Water ran straight along by the northern cliffs\r\nafter it had left Burgstead, betwixt the water and the cliffs was a wide\r\nflat way fashioned by man\xe2\x80\x99s hand.  Thus was the water again a good\r\ndefence to the Thorp, for it ran slow and deep there, and there was no\r\nother ground betwixt it and the cliffs save that road, which was easy to\r\nbar across so that no foemen might pass without battle, and this road was\r\ncalled the Portway.  For a long mile the river ran under the northern\r\ncliffs, and then turned into the midst of the Dale, and went its way\r\nwestward a broad stream winding in gentle laps and folds here and there\r\ndown to the out-gate of the Dale.  But the Portway held on still\r\nunderneath the rock-wall, till the sheer-rocks grew somewhat broken, and\r\nwere cumbered with certain screes, and at last the wayfarer came upon the\r\nbreak in them, and the ghyll through which ran the Wildlake with\r\nWildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way beside it, but the Portway still went on all down the Dale\r\nand away to the Plain-country.\r\n\r\nThat road in the ghyll, which was neither wide nor smooth, the wayfarer\r\ninto the wood must follow, till it lifted itself out of the ghyll, and\r\nleft the Wildlake coming rattling down by many steps from the east; and\r\nnow the way went straight north through the woodland, ever mounting\r\nhigher, (because the whole set of the land was toward the high fells,)\r\nbut not in any cleft or ghyll.  The wood itself thereabout was thick, a\r\nblended growth of diverse kinds of trees, but most of oak and ash; light\r\nand air enough came through their boughs to suffer the holly and bramble\r\nand eglantine and other small wood to grow together into thickets, which\r\nno man could pass without hewing a way.  But before it is told whereto\r\nWildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way led, it must be said that on the east side of the ghyll,\r\nwhere it first began just over the Portway, the hill\xe2\x80\x99s brow was clear of\r\nwood for a certain space, and there, overlooking all the Dale, was the\r\nMote-stead of the Dalesmen, marked out by a great ring of stones, amidst\r\nof which was the mound for the Judges and the Altar of the Gods before\r\nit.  And this was the holy place of the men of the Dale and of other folk\r\nwhereof the tale shall now tell.\r\n\r\nFor when Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way had gone some three miles from the Mote-stead,\r\nthe trees began to thin, and presently afterwards was a clearing and the\r\ndwellings of men, built of timber as may well be thought.  These houses\r\nwere neither rich nor great, nor was the folk a mighty folk, because they\r\nwere but a few, albeit body by body they were stout carles enough.  They\r\nhad not affinity with the Dalesmen, and did not wed with them, yet it is\r\nto be deemed that they were somewhat akin to them.  To be short, though\r\nthey were freemen, yet as regards the Dalesmen were they well-nigh their\r\nservants; for they were but poor in goods, and had to lean upon them\r\nsomewhat.  No tillage they had among those high trees; and of beasts\r\nnought save some flocks of goats and a few asses.  Hunters they were, and\r\ncharcoal-burners, and therein the deftest of men, and they could shoot\r\nwell in the bow withal: so they trucked their charcoal and their smoked\r\nvenison and their peltries with the Dalesmen for wheat and wine and\r\nweapons and weed; and the Dalesmen gave them main good pennyworths, as\r\nmen who had abundance wherewith to uphold their kinsmen, though they were\r\nbut far-away kin.  Stout hands had these Woodlanders and true hearts as\r\nany; but they were few-spoken and to those that needed them not somewhat\r\nsurly of speech and grim of visage: brown-skinned they were, but\r\nlight-haired; well-eyed, with but little red in their cheeks: their women\r\nwere not very fair, for they toiled like the men, or more.  They were\r\nthought to be wiser than most men in foreseeing things to come.  They\r\nwere much given to spells, and songs of wizardry, and were very mindful\r\nof the old story-lays, wherein they were far more wordy than in their\r\ndaily speech.  Much skill had they in runes, and were exceeding deft in\r\nscoring them on treen bowls, and on staves, and door-posts and roof-beams\r\nand standing-beds and such like things.  Many a day when the snow was\r\ndrifting over their roofs, and hanging heavy on the tree-boughs, and the\r\nwind was roaring through the trees aloft and rattling about the close\r\nthicket, when the boughs were clattering in the wind, and crashing down\r\nbeneath the weight of the gathering freezing snow, when all beasts and\r\nmen lay close in their lairs, would they sit long hours about the\r\nhouse-fire with the knife or the gouge in hand, with the timber twixt\r\ntheir knees and the whetstone beside them, hearkening to some tale of old\r\ntimes and the days when their banner was abroad in the world; and they\r\nthe while wheedling into growth out of the tough wood knots and blossoms\r\nand leaves and the images of beasts and warriors and women.\r\n\r\nThey were called nought save the Woodland-Carles in that day, though time\r\nhad been when they had borne a nobler name: and their abode was called\r\nCarlstead.  Shortly, for all they had and all they had not, for all they\r\nwere and all they were not, they were well-beloved by their friends and\r\nfeared by their foes.\r\n\r\nNow when Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way was gotten to Carlstead, there was an end of it\r\ntoward the north; though beyond it in a right line the wood was thinner,\r\nbecause of the hewing of the Carles.  But the road itself turned west at\r\nonce and went on through the wood, till some four miles further it first\r\nthinned and then ceased altogether, the ground going down-hill all the\r\nway: for this was the lower flank of the first great upheaval toward the\r\nhigh mountains.  But presently, after the wood was ended, the land broke\r\ninto swelling downs and winding dales of no great height or depth, with a\r\nfew scattered trees about the hillsides, mostly thorns or scrubby oaks,\r\ngnarled and bent and kept down by the western wind: here and there also\r\nwere yew-trees, and whiles the hillsides would be grown over with\r\nbox-wood, but none very great; and often juniper grew abundantly.  This\r\nthen was the country of the Shepherds, who were friends both of the\r\nDalesmen and the Woodlanders.  They dwelt not in any fenced town or\r\nthorp, but their homesteads were scattered about as was handy for water\r\nand shelter.  Nevertheless they had their own stronghold; for amidmost of\r\ntheir country, on the highest of a certain down above a bottom where a\r\nwillowy stream winded, was a great earthwork: the walls thereof were high\r\nand clean and overlapping at the entering in, and amidst of it was a deep\r\nwell of water, so that it was a very defensible place: and thereto would\r\nthey drive their flocks and herds when war was in the land, for nought\r\nbut a very great host might win it; and this stronghold they called\r\nGreenbury.\r\n\r\nThese Shepherd-Folk were strong and tall like the Woodlanders, for they\r\nwere partly of the same blood, but burnt they were both ruddy and brown:\r\nthey were of more words than the Woodlanders but yet not many-worded.\r\nThey knew well all those old story-lays, (and this partly by the\r\nminstrelsy of the Woodlanders,) but they had scant skill in wizardry, and\r\nwould send for the Woodlanders, both men and women, to do whatso they\r\nneeded therein.  They were very hale and long-lived, whereas they dwelt\r\nin clear bright air, and they mostly went light-clad even in the winter,\r\nso strong and merry were they.  They wedded with the Woodlanders and the\r\nDalesmen both; at least certain houses of them did so.  They grew no\r\ncorn; nought but a few pot-herbs, but had their meal of the Dalesmen; and\r\nin the summer they drave some of their milch-kine into the Dale for the\r\nabundance of grass there; whereas their own hills and bents and winding\r\nvalleys were not plenteously watered, except here and there as in the\r\nbottom under Greenbury.  No swine they had, and but few horses, but of\r\nsheep very many, and of the best both for their flesh and their wool.\r\nYet were they nought so deft craftsmen at the loom as were the Dalesmen,\r\nand their women were not very eager at the weaving, though they loathed\r\nnot the spindle and rock.  Shortly, they were merry folk well-beloved of\r\nthe Dalesmen, quick to wrath, though it abode not long with them; not\r\nvery curious in their houses and halls, which were but little, and were\r\ndecked mostly with the handiwork of the Woodland-Carles their guests; who\r\nwhen they were abiding with them, would oft stand long hours nose to\r\nbeam, scoring and nicking and hammering, answering no word spoken to them\r\nbut with aye or no, desiring nought save the endurance of the daylight.\r\nMoreover, this shepherd-folk heeded not gay raiment over-much, but\r\ncommonly went clad in white woollen or sheep-brown weed.\r\n\r\nBut beyond this shepherd-folk were more downs and more, scantily peopled,\r\nand that after a while by folk with whom they had no kinship or affinity,\r\nand who were at whiles their foes.  Yet was there no enduring enmity\r\nbetween them; and ever after war and battle came peace; and all\r\nblood-wites were duly paid and no long feud followed: nor were the\r\nDalesmen and the Woodlanders always in these wars, though at whiles they\r\nwere.  Thus then it fared with these people.\r\n\r\nBut now that we have told of the folks with whom the Dalesmen had\r\nkinship, affinity, and friendship, tell we of their chief abode,\r\nBurgstead to wit, and of its fashion.  As hath been told, it lay upon the\r\nland made nigh into an isle by the folds of the Weltering Water towards\r\nthe uppermost end of the Dale; and it was warded by the deep water, and\r\nby the wall aforesaid with its towers.  Now the Dale at its widest, to\r\nwit where Wildlake fell into it, was but nine furlongs over, but at\r\nBurgstead it was far narrower; so that betwixt the wall and the wandering\r\nstream there was but a space of fifty acres, and therein lay Burgstead in\r\na space of the shape of a sword-pommel: and the houses of the kinships\r\nlay about it, amidst of gardens and orchards, but little ordered into\r\nstreets and lanes, save that a way went clean through everything from the\r\ntower-warded gate to the bridge over the Water, which was warded by two\r\nother towers on its hither side.\r\n\r\nAs to the houses, they were some bigger, some smaller, as the housemates\r\nneeded.  Some were old, but not very old, save two only, and some quite\r\nnew, but of these there were not many: they were all built fairly of\r\nstone and lime, with much fair and curious carved work of knots and\r\nbeasts and men round about the doors; or whiles a wale of such-like work\r\nall along the house-front.  For as deft as were the Woodlanders with\r\nknife and gouge on the oaken beams, even so deft were the Dalesmen with\r\nmallet and chisel on the face of the hewn stone; and this was a great\r\npastime about the Thorp.  Within these houses had but a hall and solar,\r\nwith shut-beds out from the hall on one side or two, with whatso of\r\nkitchen and buttery and out-bower men deemed handy.  Many men dwelt in\r\neach house, either kinsfolk, or such as were joined to the kindred.\r\n\r\nNear to the gate of Burgstead in that street aforesaid and facing east\r\nwas the biggest house of the Thorp; it was one of the two abovesaid which\r\nwere older than any other.  Its door-posts and the lintel of the door\r\nwere carved with knots and twining stems fairer than other houses of that\r\nstead; and on the wall beside the door carved over many stones was an\r\nimage wrought in the likeness of a man with a wide face, which was\r\nterrible to behold, although it smiled: he bore a bent bow in his hand\r\nwith an arrow fitted to its string, and about the head of him was a ring\r\nof rays like the beams of the sun, and at his feet was a dragon, which\r\nhad crept, as it were, from amidst of the blossomed knots of the\r\ndoor-post wherewith the tail of him was yet entwined.  And this head with\r\nthe ring of rays about it was wrought into the adornment of that house,\r\nboth within and without, in many other places, but on never another house\r\nof the Dale; and it was called the House of the Face.  Thereof hath the\r\ntale much to tell hereafter, but as now it goeth on to tell of the ways\r\nof life of the Dalesmen.\r\n\r\nIn Burgstead was no Mote-hall or Town-house or Church, such as we wot of\r\nin these days; and their market-place was wheresoever any might choose to\r\npitch a booth: but for the most part this was done in the wide street\r\nbetwixt the gate and the bridge.  As to a meeting-place, were there any\r\nsmall matters between man and man, these would the Alderman or one of the\r\nWardens deal with, sitting in Court with the neighbours on the wide space\r\njust outside the Gate: but if it were to do with greater matters, such as\r\ngreat manslayings and blood-wites, or the making of war or ending of it,\r\nor the choosing of the Alderman and the Wardens, such matters must be put\r\noff to the Folk-mote, which could but be held in the place aforesaid\r\nwhere was the Doom-ring and the Altar of the Gods; and at that Folk-mote\r\nboth the Shepherd-Folk and the Woodland-Carles foregathered with the\r\nDalesmen, and duly said their say.  There also they held their great\r\ncasts and made offerings to the Gods for the Fruitfulness of the Year,\r\nthe ingathering of the increase, and in Memory of their Forefathers.\r\nNatheless at Yule-tide also they feasted from house to house to be glad\r\nwith the rest of Midwinter, and many a cup drank at those feasts to the\r\nmemory of the fathers, and the days when the world was wider to them, and\r\ntheir banners fared far afield.\r\n\r\nBut besides these dwellings of men in the field between the wall and the\r\nwater, there were homesteads up and down the Dale whereso men found it\r\neasy and pleasant to dwell: their halls were built of much the same\r\nfashion as those within the Thorp; but many had a high garth-wall cast\r\nabout them, so that they might make a stout defence in their own houses\r\nif war came into the Dale.\r\n\r\nAs to their work afield; in many places the Dale was fair with growth of\r\ntrees, and especially were there long groves of sweet chestnut standing\r\non the grass, of the fruit whereof the folk had much gain.  Also on the\r\nsouth side nigh to the western end was a wood or two of yew-trees very\r\ngreat and old, whence they gat them bow-staves, for the Dalesmen also\r\nshot well in the bow.  Much wheat and rye they raised in the Dale, and\r\nespecially at the nether end thereof.  Apples and pears and cherries and\r\nplums they had in plenty; of which trees, some grew about the borders of\r\nthe acres, some in the gardens of the Thorp and the homesteads.  On the\r\nslopes that had grown from the breaking down here and there of the\r\nNorthern cliffs, and which faced the South and the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s burning, were\r\nrows of goodly vines, whereof the folk made them enough and to spare of\r\nstrong wine both white and red.\r\n\r\nAs to their beasts; swine they had a many, but not many sheep, since\r\nherein they trusted to their trucking with their friends the Shepherds;\r\nthey had horses, and yet but a few, for they were stout in going afoot;\r\nand, had they a journey to make with women big with babes, or with\r\nchildren or outworn elders, they would yoke their oxen to their wains,\r\nand go fair and softly whither they would.  But the said oxen and all\r\ntheir neat were exceeding big and fair, far other than the little beasts\r\nof the Shepherd-Folk; they were either dun of colour, or white with black\r\nhorns (and those very great) and black tail-tufts and ear-tips.  Asses\r\nthey had, and mules for the paths of the mountains to the east; geese and\r\nhens enough, and dogs not a few, great hounds stronger than wolves,\r\nsharp-nosed, long-jawed, dun of colour, shag-haired.\r\n\r\nAs to their wares; they were very deft weavers of wool and flax, and made\r\na shift to dye the thrums in fair colours; since both woad and madder\r\ncame to them good cheap by means of the merchants of the plain country,\r\nand of greening weeds was abundance at hand.  Good smiths they were in\r\nall the metals: they washed somewhat of gold out of the sands of the\r\nWeltering Water, and copper and tin they fetched from the rocks of the\r\neastern mountains; but of silver they saw little, and iron they must buy\r\nof the merchants of the plain, who came to them twice in the year, to wit\r\nin the spring and the late autumn just before the snows.  Their wares\r\nthey bought with wool spun and in the fleece, and fine cloth, and skins\r\nof wine and young neat both steers and heifers, and wrought copper bowls,\r\nand gold and copper by weight, for they had no stamped money.  And they\r\nguested these merchants well, for they loved them, because of the tales\r\nthey told them of the Plain and its cities, and the manslayings therein,\r\nand the fall of Kings and Dukes, and the uprising of Captains.\r\n\r\nThus then lived this folk in much plenty and ease of life, though not\r\ndelicately nor desiring things out of measure.  They wrought with their\r\nhands and wearied themselves; and they rested from their toil and feasted\r\nand were merry: to-morrow was not a burden to them, nor yesterday a thing\r\nwhich they would fain forget: life shamed them not, nor did death make\r\nthem afraid.\r\n\r\nAs for the Dale wherein they dwelt, it was indeed most fair and lovely,\r\nand they deemed it the Blessing of the Earth, and they trod its flowery\r\ngrass beside its rippled streams amidst its green tree-boughs proudly and\r\njoyfully with goodly bodies and merry hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.  OF FACE-OF-GOD AND HIS KINDRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELLS the tale, that on an evening of late autumn when the weather was\r\nfair, calm, and sunny, there came a man out of the wood hard by the\r\nMote-stead aforesaid, who sat him down at the roots of the Speech-mound,\r\ncasting down before him a roe-buck which he had just slain in the wood.\r\nHe was a young man of three and twenty summers; he was so clad that he\r\nhad on him a sheep-brown kirtle and leggings of like stuff bound about\r\nwith white leather thongs; he bore a short-sword in his girdle and a\r\nlittle axe withal; the sword with fair wrought gilded hilts and a\r\ndew-shoe of like fashion to its sheath.  He had his quiver at his back\r\nand bare in his hand his bow unstrung.  He was tall and strong, very fair\r\nof fashion both of limbs and face, white-skinned, but for the sun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntanning, and ruddy-cheeked: his beard was little and fine, his hair\r\nyellow and curling, cut somewhat close, but for its length so plenteous,\r\nand so thick, that none could fail to note it.  He had no hat nor hood\r\nupon his head, nought but a fillet of golden beads.\r\n\r\nAs he sat down he glanced at the dale below him with a well-pleased look,\r\nand then cast his eyes down to the grass at his feet, as though to hold a\r\nlittle longer all unchanged the image of the fair place he had just seen.\r\nThe sun was low in the heavens, and his slant beams fell yellow all up\r\nthe dale, gilding the chestnut groves grown dusk and grey with autumn,\r\nand the black masses of the elm-boughs, and gleaming back here and there\r\nfrom the pools of the Weltering Water.  Down in the midmost meadows the\r\nlong-horned dun kine were moving slowly as they fed along the edges of\r\nthe stream, and a dog was bounding about with exceeding swiftness here\r\nand there among them.  At a sharply curved bight of the river the man\r\ncould see a little vermilion flame flickering about, and above it a thin\r\nblue veil of smoke hanging in the air, and clinging to the boughs of the\r\nwillows anear; about it were a dozen menfolk clear to see, some sitting,\r\nsome standing, some walking to and fro, but all in company together: four\r\nof were brown-clad and short-skirted like himself, and from above the\r\nhand of one came a flash of light as the sun smote upon the steel of his\r\nspear.  The others were long-skirted and clad gayer, and amongst them\r\nwere red and blue and green and white garments, and they were clear to be\r\nseen for women.  Just as the young man looked up again, those of them who\r\nwere sitting down rose up, and those that were strolling drew nigh, and\r\nthey joined hands together, and fell to dancing on the grass, and the dog\r\nand another one with him came up to the dancers and raced about and\r\nbetwixt them; and so clear to see were they all and so little, being far\r\naway, that they looked like dainty well-wrought puppets.\r\n\r\nThe young man sat smiling at it for a little, and then rose up and\r\nshouldered his venison, and went down into Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way, and presently\r\nwas fairly in the Dale and striding along the Portway beside the northern\r\ncliffs, whose greyness was gilded yet by the last rays of the sun, though\r\nin a minute or two it would go under the western rim.  He went fast and\r\ncheerily, murmuring to himself snatches of old songs; none overtook him\r\non the road, but he overtook divers folk going alone or in company toward\r\nBurgstead; swains and old men, mothers and maidens coming from the field\r\nand the acre, or going from house to house; and one or two he met but not\r\nmany.  All these greeted him kindly, and he them again; but he stayed not\r\nto speak with any, but went as one in haste.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk by then he passed under the gate of Burgstead; he went\r\nstraight thence to the door of the House of the Face, and entered as one\r\nwho is at home, and need go no further, nor abide a bidding.\r\n\r\nThe hall he came into straight out of the open air was long and somewhat\r\nnarrow and not right high; it was well-nigh dark now within, but since he\r\nknew where to look, he could see by the flicker that leapt up now and\r\nthen from the smouldering brands of the hearth amidmost the hall under\r\nthe luffer, that there were but three men therein, and belike they were\r\neven they whom he looked to find there, and for their part they looked\r\nfor his coming, and knew his step.\r\n\r\nHe set down his venison on the floor, and cried out in a cheery voice:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ho, Kettel!  Are all men gone without doors to sleep so near the\r\nwinter-tide, that the Hall is as dark as a cave?  Hither to me!  Or art\r\nthou also sleeping?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA voice came from the further side of the hearth: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, lord, asleep I\r\nam, and have been, and dreaming; and in my dream I dealt with the\r\nflesh-pots and the cake-board, and thou shalt see my dream come true\r\npresently to thy gain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nQuoth another voice: \xe2\x80\x98Kettel hath had out that share of his dream already\r\nbelike, if the saw sayeth sooth about cooks.  All ye have been away, so\r\nbelike he hath done as Rafe\xe2\x80\x99s dog when Rafe ran away from the slain\r\nbuck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed therewith, and Kettel with him, and a third voice joined the\r\nlaughter.  The young man also laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98Here I bring the venison\r\nwhich my kinsman desired; but as ye see I have brought it over-late: but\r\ntake it, Kettel.  When cometh my father from the stithy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nQuoth Kettel: \xe2\x80\x98My lord hath been hard at it shaping the Yule-tide sword,\r\nand doth not lightly leave such work, as ye wot, but he will be here\r\npresently, for he has sent to bid us dight for supper straightway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the young man: \xe2\x80\x98Where are there lords in the dale, Kettel, or hast\r\nthou made some thyself, that thou must be always throwing them in my\r\nteeth?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Son of the Alderman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Kettel, \xe2\x80\x98ye call me Kettel, which is no name\r\nof mine, so why should I not call thee lord, which is no dignity of\r\nthine, since it goes well over my tongue from old use and wont?  But here\r\ncomes my mate of the kettle, and the women and lads.  Sit down by the\r\nhearth away from their hurry, and I will fetch thee the hand-water.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe young man sat down, and Kettel took up the venison and went his ways\r\ntoward the door at the lower end of the hall; but ere he reached it it\r\nopened, and a noisy crowd entered of men, women, boys, and dogs, some\r\nbearing great wax candles, some bowls and cups and dishes and trenchers,\r\nand some the boards for the meal.\r\n\r\nThe young man sat quiet smiling and winking his eyes at the sudden flood\r\nof light let into the dark place; he took in without looking at this or\r\nthe other thing the aspect of his Fathers\xe2\x80\x99 House, so long familiar to\r\nhim; yet to-night he had a pleasure in it above his wont, and in all the\r\nstir of the household; for the thought of the wood wherein he had\r\nwandered all day yet hung heavy upon him.  Came one of the girls and cast\r\nfresh brands on the smouldering fire and stirred it into a blaze, and the\r\nwax candles were set up on the da\xc3\xafs, so that between them and the\r\nmew-quickened fire every corner of the hall was bright.  As aforesaid it\r\nwas long and narrow, over-arched with stone and not right high, the\r\nwindows high up under the springing of the roof-arch and all on the side\r\ntoward the street; over against them were the arches of the shut-beds of\r\nthe housemates.  The walls were bare that evening, but folk were wont to\r\nhang up hallings of woven pictures thereon when feasts and high-days were\r\ntoward; and all along the walls were the tenter-hooks for that purpose,\r\nand divers weapons and tools were hanging from them here and there.\r\nAbout the da\xc3\xafs behind the thwart-table were now stuck for adornment leavy\r\nboughs of oak now just beginning to turn with the first frosts.  High up\r\non the gable wall above the tenter-hooks for the hangings were carven\r\nfair imagery and knots and twining stems; for there in the hewn atone was\r\nset forth that same image with the rayed head that was on the outside\r\nwall, and he was smiting the dragon and slaying him; but here inside the\r\nhouse all this was stained in fair and lively colours, and the sun-like\r\nrays round the head of the image were of beaten gold.  At the lower end\r\nof the hall were two doors going into the butteries, and kitchen, and\r\nother out-bowers; and above these doors was a loft upborne by stone\r\npillars, which loft was the sleeping chamber of the goodman of the house;\r\nbut the outward door was halfway between the said loft and the hearth of\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nSo the young man took the shoes from his feet and then sat watching the\r\nwomen and lads arraying the boards, till Kettel came again to him with an\r\nold woman bearing the ewer and basin, who washed his feet and poured the\r\nwater over his hands, and gave him the towel with fair-broidered ends to\r\ndry them withal.\r\n\r\nScarce had he made an end of this ere through the outer door came in\r\nthree men and a young woman with them; the foremost of these was a man\r\nyounger by some two years than the first-comer, but so like him that none\r\nmight misdoubt that he was his brother; the next was an old man with a\r\nlong white beard, but hale and upright; and lastly came a man of\r\nmiddle-age, who led the young woman by the hand.  He was taller than the\r\nfirst of the young men, though the other who entered with him outwent him\r\nin height; a stark carle he was, broad across the shoulders, thin in the\r\nflank, long-armed and big-handed; very noble and well-fashioned of\r\ncountenance, with a straight nose and grey eyes underneath a broad brow:\r\nhis hair grown somewhat scanty was done about with a fillet of golden\r\nbeads like the young men his sons.  For indeed this was their father, and\r\nthe master of the House.\r\n\r\nHis name was Iron-face, for he was the deftest of weapon-smiths, and he\r\nwas the Alderman of the Dalesmen, and well-beloved of them; his kindred\r\nwas deemed the noblest of the Dale, and long had they dwelt in the House\r\nof the Face.  But of his sons the youngest, the new-comer, was named\r\nHall-face, and his brother the elder Face-of-god; which name was of old\r\nuse amongst the kindred, and many great men and stout warriors had borne\r\nit aforetime: and this young man, in great love had he been gotten, and\r\nin much hope had he been reared, and therefore had he been named after\r\nthe best of the kindred.  But his mother, who was hight the Jewel, and\r\nhad been a very fair woman, was dead now, and Iron-face lacked a wife.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god was well-beloved of his kindred and of all the Folk of the\r\nDale, and he had gotten a to-name, and was called Gold-mane because of\r\nthe abundance and fairness of his hair.\r\n\r\nAs for the young woman that was led in by Iron-face, she was the\r\nbetrothed of Face-of-god, and her name was the Bride.  She looked with\r\nsuch eyes of love on him when she saw him in the hall, as though she had\r\nnever seen him before but once, nor loved him but since yesterday; though\r\nin truth they had grown up together and had seen each other most days of\r\nthe year for many years.  She was of the kindred with whom the chiefs and\r\ngreat men of the Face mostly wedded, which was indeed far away kindred of\r\nthem.  She was a fair woman and strong: not easily daunted amidst perils\r\nshe was hardy and handy and light-foot: she could swim as well as any,\r\nand could shoot well in the bow, and wield sword and spear: yet was she\r\nkind and compassionate, and of great courtesy, and the very dogs and kine\r\ntrusted in her and loved her.  Her hair was dark red of hue, long and\r\nfine and plenteous, her eyes great and brown, her brow broad and very\r\nfair, her lips fine and red: her cheek not ruddy, yet nowise sallow, but\r\nclear and bright: tall she was and of excellent fashion, but well-knit\r\nand well-measured rather than slender and wavering as the willow-bough.\r\nHer voice was sweet and soft, her words few, but exceeding dear to the\r\nlistener.  In short, she was a woman born to be the ransom of her Folk.\r\n\r\nNow as to the names which the menfolk of the Face bore, and they an\r\nancient kindred, a kindred of chieftains, it has been said that in times\r\npast their image of the God of the Earth had over his treen face a mask\r\nof beaten gold fashioned to the shape of the image; and that when the\r\nAlderman of the Folk died, he to wit who served the God and bore on his\r\narm the gold-ring between the people and the altar, this visor or face of\r\nGod was laid over the face of him who had been in a manner his priest,\r\nand therewith he was borne to mound; and the new Alderman and priest had\r\nit in charge to fashion a new visor for the God; and whereas for long\r\nthis great kindred had been chieftains of the people, they had been, and\r\nwere all so named, that the word Face was ever a part of their names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.  THEY TALK OF DIVERS MATTERS IN THE HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW Face-of-god, who is also called Gold-mane, rose up to meet the\r\nnew-comers, and each of them greeted him kindly, and the Bride kissed him\r\non the cheek, and he her in likewise; and he looked kindly on her, and\r\ntook her hand, and went on up the hall to the da\xc3\xafs, following his father\r\nand the old man; as for him, he was of the kindred of the House, and was\r\nfoster-father of Iron-face and of his sons both; and his name was\r\nStone-face: a stark warrior had he been when he was young, and even now\r\nhe could do a man\xe2\x80\x99s work in the battlefield, and his understanding was as\r\ngood as that of a man in his prime.  So went these and four others up on\r\nto the da\xc3\xafs and sat down before the thwart-table looking down the hall,\r\nfor the meat was now on the board; and of the others there were some\r\nfifty men and women who were deemed to be of the kindred and sat at the\r\nendlong tables.\r\n\r\nSo then the Alderman stood up and made the sign of the Hammer over the\r\nmeat, the token of his craft and of his God.  Then they fell to with good\r\nhearts, for there was enough and to spare of meat and drink.  There was\r\nbread and flesh (though not Gold-mane\xe2\x80\x99s venison), and leeks and roasted\r\nchestnuts of the grove, and red-cheeked apples of the garth, and honey\r\nenough of that year\xe2\x80\x99s gathering, and medlars sharp and mellow: moreover,\r\ngood wine of the western bents went up and down the hall in great gilded\r\ncopper bowls and in mazers girt and lipped with gold.\r\n\r\nBut when they were full of meat, and had drunken somewhat, they fell to\r\nspeech, and Iron-face spake aloud to his son, who had but been speaking\r\nsoftly to the Bride as one playmate to the other: but the Alderman said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Scarce are the wood-deer grown, kinsman, when I must needs eat sheep\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflesh on a Thursday, though my son has lain abroad in the woods all night\r\nto hunt for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd therewith he smiled in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s face; but Gold-mane reddened\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98So is it, kinsman, I can hit what I can see; but not what is\r\nhidden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIron-face laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98Hast thou been to the Woodland-Carles? are\r\ntheir women fairer than our cousins?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god took up the Bride\xe2\x80\x99s hand in his and kissed it and laid it to\r\nhis cheek; and then turned to his father and said: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, father, I saw\r\nnot the Wood-carles, nor went to their abode; and on no day do I lust\r\nafter their women.  Moreover, I brought home a roebuck of the fattest;\r\nbut I was over-late for Kettel, and the flesh was ready for the board by\r\nthen I came.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, son,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Iron-face, for he was merry, \xe2\x80\x98a roebuck is but a\r\nlittle deer for such big men as are thou and I.  But I rede thee take the\r\nBride along with thee the next time; and she shall seek whilest thou\r\nsleepest, and hit when thou missest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god smiled, but he frowned somewhat also, and he said: \xe2\x80\x98Well\r\nwere that, indeed!  But if ye must needs drag a true tale out of me: that\r\nroebuck I shot at the very edge of the wood nigh to the Mote-stead as I\r\nwas coming home: harts had I seen in the wood and its lawns, and boars,\r\nand bucks, and loosed not at them: for indeed when I awoke in the morning\r\nin that wood-lawn ye wot of, I wandered up and down with my bow unbent.\r\nSo it was that I fared as if I were seeking something, I know not what,\r\nthat should fill up something lacking to me, I know not what.  Thus I\r\nfelt in myself even so long as I was underneath the black boughs, and\r\nthere was none beside me and before me, and none to turn aback to: but\r\nwhen I came out again into the sunshine, and I saw the fair dale, and the\r\nhappy abode lying before me, and folk abroad in the meads merry in the\r\neventide; then was I full fain of it, and loathed the wood as an empty\r\nthing that had nought to give me; and lo you! all that I had been longing\r\nfor in the wood, was it not in this House and ready to my hand?\xe2\x80\x94and that\r\nis good meseemeth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he drank of the cup which the Bride put into his hand after she\r\nhad kissed the rim, but when he had set it down again he spake once more:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet now I am sitting honoured and well-beloved in the House of my\r\nFathers, with the holy hearth sparkling and gleaming down there before\r\nme; and she that shall bear my children sitting soft and kind by my side,\r\nand the bold lads I shall one day lead in battle drinking out of my very\r\ncup: now it seems to me that amidst all this, the dark cold wood, wherein\r\nabide but the beasts and the Foes of the Gods, is bidding me to it and\r\ndrawing me thither.  Narrow is the Dale and the World is wide; I would it\r\nwere dawn and daylight, that I might be afoot again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he half rose up from his place.  But his father bent his brow on him\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Kinsman, thou hast a long tongue for a half-trained whelp: nor\r\nsee I whitherward thy mind is wandering, but if it be on the road of a\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x99s desire to go further and fare worse.  Hearken then, I will offer\r\nthee somewhat!  Soon shall the West-country merchants be here with their\r\nwinter truck.  How sayest thou? hast thou a mind to fare back with them,\r\nand look on the Plain and its Cities, and take and give with the\r\nstrangers?  To whom indeed thou shalt be nothing save a purse with a few\r\nlumps of gold in it, or maybe a spear in the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s band on the\r\nstricken field, or a bow on the wall of an alien city.  This is a craft\r\nwhich thou mayst well learn, since thou shalt be a chieftain; a craft\r\ngood to learn, however grievous it be in the learning.  And I myself have\r\nbeen there; for in my youth I desired sore to look on the world beyond\r\nthe mountains; so I went, and I filled my belly with the fruit of my own\r\ndesires, and a bitter meat was that; but now that it has passed through\r\nme, and I yet alive, belike I am more of a grown man for having endured\r\nits gripe.  Even so may it well be with thee, son; so go if thou wilt;\r\nand thou shalt go with my blessing, and with gold and wares and wain and\r\nspearmen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98I thank thee, for it is well offered; but I\r\nwill not go, for I have no lust for the Plain and its Cities; I love the\r\nDale well, and all that is round about it; therein will I live and die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he fell a-musing; and the Bride looked at him anxiously, but\r\nspake not.  Sooth to say her heart was sinking, as though she foreboded\r\nsome new thing, which should thrust itself into their merry life.\r\n\r\nBut the old man Stone-face took up the word and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Son Gold-mane, it behoveth me to speak, since belike I know the\r\nwild-wood better than most, and have done for these three-score and ten\r\nyears; to my cost.  Now I perceive that thou longest for the wood and the\r\ninnermost of it; and wot ye what?  This longing will at whiles entangle\r\nthe sons of our chieftains, though this Alderman that now is hath been\r\nfree therefrom, which is well for him.  For, time was this longing came\r\nover me, and I went whither it led me: overlong it were to tell of all\r\nthat befell me because of it, and how my heart bled thereby.  So sorry\r\nwere the tidings that came of it, that now meseemeth my heart should be\r\nof stone and not my face, had it not been for the love wherewith I have\r\nloved the sons of the kindred.  Therefore, son, it were not ill if ye\r\nwent west away with the merchants this winter, and learned the dealings\r\nof the cities, and brought us back tales thereof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Gold-mane cried out somewhat angrily, \xe2\x80\x98I tell thee, foster-father,\r\nthat I have no mind for the cities and their men and their fools and\r\ntheir whores and their runagates.  But as for the wood and its wonders, I\r\nhave done with it, save for hunting there along with others of the Folk.\r\nSo let thy mind be at ease; and for the rest, I will do what the Alderman\r\ncommandeth, and whatso my father craveth of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that is well, son,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98if what ye say come to pass,\r\nas sore I misdoubt me it will not.  But well it were, well it were!  For\r\nsuch things are in the wood, yea and before ye come to its innermost, as\r\nmay well try the stoutest heart.  Therein are Kobbolds, and Wights that\r\nlove not men, things unto whom the grief of men is as the sound of the\r\nfiddle-bow unto us.  And there abide the ghosts of those that may not\r\nrest; and there wander the dwarfs and the mountain-dwellers, the dealers\r\nin marvels, the givers of gifts that destroy Houses; the forgers of the\r\ncurse that clingeth and the murder that flitteth to and fro.  There\r\nmoreover are the lairs of Wights in the shapes of women, that draw a\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s heart out of his body, and fill up the empty place with\r\ndesire never to be satisfied, that they may mock him therewith and waste\r\nhis manhood and destroy him.  Nor say I much of the strong-thieves that\r\ndwell there, since thou art a valiant sword; or of them who have been\r\nmade Wolves of the Holy Places; or of the Murder-Carles, the remnants and\r\noff-scourings of wicked and wretched Folks\xe2\x80\x94men who think as much of the\r\nlife of a man as of the life of a fly.  Yet happiest is the man whom they\r\nshall tear in pieces, than he who shall live burdened by the curse of the\r\nFoes of the Gods.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe housemaster looked on his son as the old carle spake, and a cloud\r\ngathered on his face a while; and when Stone-face had made an end he\r\nspake:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is long and evil talk for the end of a merry day, O fosterer!  Wilt\r\nthou not drink a draught, O Redesman, and then stand up and set thy\r\nfiddle-bow a-dancing, and cause it draw some fair words after it?  For my\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s face hath grown sadder than a young maid\xe2\x80\x99s should be, and my\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s eyes gleam with thoughts that are far away from us and abroad in\r\nthe wild-wood seeking marvels.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen arose a man of middle-age from the top of the endlong bench on the\r\neast side of the hall: a man tall, thin and scant-haired, with a nose\r\nlike an eagle\xe2\x80\x99s neb: he reached out his hand for the bowl, and when they\r\nhad given to him he handled it, and raised it aloft and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here I drink a double health to Face-of-god and the Bride, and the love\r\nthat lieth between them, and the love betwixt them twain and us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe drank therewith, and the wine went up and down the hall, and all men\r\ndrank, both carles and queens, with shouting and great joy.  Then\r\nRedesman put down the cup (for it had come into his hands again), and\r\nreached his hand to the wall behind him, and took down his fiddle hanging\r\nthere in its case, and drew it out and fell to tuning it, while the hall\r\ngrew silent to hearken: then he handled the bow and laid it on the\r\nstrings till they wailed and chuckled sweetly, and when the song was well\r\nawake and stirring briskly, then he lifted up his voice and sang:\r\n\r\n                          _The Minstrel saith_:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98O why on this morning, ye maids, are ye tripping\r\n      Aloof from the meadows yet fresh with the dew,\r\n   Where under the west wind the river is lipping\r\n      The fragrance of mint, the white blooms and the blue?\r\n\r\n   For rough is the Portway where panting ye wander;\r\n      On your feet and your gown-hems the dust lieth dun;\r\n   Come trip through the grass and the meadow-sweet yonder,\r\n      And forget neath the willows the sword of the sun.\r\n\r\n                          _The Maidens answer_:\r\n\r\n   Though fair are the moon-daisies down by the river,\r\n      And soft is the grass and the white clover sweet;\r\n   Though twixt us and the rock-wall the hot glare doth quiver,\r\n      And the dust of the wheel-way is dun on our feet;\r\n\r\n   Yet here on the way shall we walk on this morning\r\n      Though the sun burneth here, and sweet, cool is the mead;\r\n   For here when in old days the Burg gave its warning,\r\n      Stood stark under weapons the doughty of deed.\r\n\r\n   Here came on the aliens their proud words a-crying,\r\n      And here on our threshold they stumbled and fell;\r\n   Here silent at even the steel-clad were lying,\r\n      And here were our mothers the story to tell.\r\n\r\n   Here then on the morn of the eve of the wedding\r\n      We pray to the Mighty that we too may bear\r\n   Such war-walls for warding of orchard and steading,\r\n      That the new days be merry as old days were dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he made an end, and shouts and glad cries arose all about the\r\nhall; and an old man arose and cried: \xe2\x80\x98A cup to the memory of the Mighty\r\nof the Day of the Warding of the Ways.\xe2\x80\x99  For you must know this song told\r\nof a custom of the Folk, held in memory of a time of bygone battle,\r\nwherein they had overthrown a great host of aliens on the Portway betwixt\r\nthe river and the cliffs, two furlongs from the gate of Burgstead.  So\r\nnow two weeks before Midsummer those maidens who were presently to be\r\nwedded went early in the morning to that place clad in very fair raiment,\r\nswords girt to their sides and spears in their hands, and abode there on\r\nthe highway from morn till even as though they were a guard to it.  And\r\nthey made merry there, singing songs and telling tales of times past: and\r\nat the sunsetting their grooms came to fetch them away to the Feast of\r\nthe Eve of the Wedding.\r\n\r\nWhile the song was a-singing Face-of-god took the Bride\xe2\x80\x99s hand in his and\r\ncaressed it, and was soft and blithe with her; and she reddened and\r\ntrembled for pleasure, and called to mind wedding feasts that had been,\r\nand fair brides that she had seen thereat, and she forgot her fears and\r\nher heart was at peace again.\r\n\r\nAnd Iron-face looked well-pleased on the two from time to time, and\r\nsmiled, but forbore words to them.\r\n\r\nBut up and down the hall men talked with one another about things long\r\nago betid: for their hearts were high and they desired deeds; but in that\r\nfair Dale so happy were the years from day to day that there was but\r\nlittle to tell of.  So deepened the night and waned, and Gold-mane and\r\nthe Bride still talked sweetly together, and at whiles kindly to the\r\nothers; and by seeming he had clean forgotten the wood and its wonders.\r\n\r\nThen at last the Alderman called for the cup of good-night, and men drank\r\nthereof and went their ways to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.  FACE-OF-GOD FARETH TO THE WOOD AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN it was the earliest morning and dawn was but just beginning,\r\nFace-of-god awoke and rose up from his bed, and came forth into the hall\r\nnaked in his shirt, and stood by the hearth, wherein the piled-up embers\r\nwere yet red, and looked about and could see nothing stirring in the\r\ndimness: then he fetched water and washed the night-tide off him, and\r\nclad himself in haste, and was even as he was yesterday, save that he\r\nleft his bow and quiver in their place and took instead a short\r\ncasting-spear; moreover he took a leathern scrip and went therewith to\r\nthe buttery, and set therein bread and flesh and a little gilded beaker;\r\nand all this he did with but little noise; for he would not be\r\nquestioned, lest he should have to answer himself as well as others.\r\n\r\nThus he went quietly out of doors, for the door was but latched, since no\r\nbolts or bars or locks were used in Burgstead, and through the town-gate,\r\nwhich stood open, save when rumours of war were about.  He turned his\r\nface straight towards Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way, walking briskly, but at whiles\r\nlooking back over his shoulder toward the East to note what way was made\r\nby the dawning, and how the sky lightened above the mountain passes.\r\n\r\nBy then he was come to the place where the Maiden Ward was held in the\r\nsummer the dawn was so far forward that all things had their due colours,\r\nand were clear to see in the shadowless day.  It was a bright morning,\r\nwith an easterly air stirring that drave away the haze and dried the\r\nmeadows, which had otherwise been rimy; for it was cold.  Gold-mane\r\nlingered on the place a little, and his eyes fell on the road, as dusty\r\nyet as in Redesman\xe2\x80\x99s song; for the autumn had been very dry, and the\r\nstrip of green that edged the outside of the way was worn and dusty also.\r\nOn the edge of it, half in the dusty road, half on the worn grass, was a\r\nlong twine of briony red-berried and black-leaved; and right in the midst\r\nof the road were two twigs of great-leaved sturdy pollard oak, as though\r\nthey had been thrown aside there yesterday by women or children\r\na-sporting; and the deep white dust yet held the marks of feet, some\r\nbare, some shod, crossing each other here and there.  Face-of-god smiled\r\nas he passed on, as a man with a happy thought; for his mind showed him a\r\npicture of the Bride as she would be leading the Maiden Ward next summer,\r\nand singing first among the singers, and he saw her as clearly as he had\r\noften seen her verily, and before him was the fashion of her hands and\r\nall her body, and the little mark on her right wrist, and the place where\r\nher arm whitened, because the sleeve guarded it against the sun, which\r\nhad long been pleasant unto him, and the little hollow in her chin, and\r\nthe lock of red-brown hair waving in the wind above her brow, and shining\r\nin the sun as brightly as the Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s cunningest work of golden wire.\r\nSoft and sweet seemed that picture, till he almost seemed to hear her\r\nsweet voice calling to him, and desire of her so took hold of the youth,\r\nthat it stirred him up to go swiftlier as he strode on, the day\r\nbrightening behind him.\r\n\r\nNow was it nigh sunrise, and he began to meet folk on the way, though not\r\nmany; since for most their way lay afield, and not towards the Burg.  The\r\nfirst was a Woodlander, tall and gaunt, striding beside his ass, whose\r\npanniers were laden with charcoal.  The carle\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, a little maiden\r\nof seven winters, riding on the ass\xe2\x80\x99s back betwixt the panniers, and\r\nprattling to herself in the cold morning; for she was pleased with the\r\nclear light in the east, and the smooth wide turf of the meadows, as one\r\nwho had not often been far from the shadow of the heavy trees of the\r\nwood, and their dark wall round about the clearing where they dwelt.\r\nFace-of-god gave the twain the sele of the day in merry fashion as he\r\npassed them by, and the sober dark-faced man nodded to him but spake no\r\nword, and the child stayed her prattle to watch him as he went by.\r\n\r\nThen came the sound of the rattle of wheels, and, as he doubled an angle\r\nof the rock-wall, he came upon a wain drawn by four dun kine, wherein lay\r\na young woman all muffled up against the cold with furs and cloths;\r\nbeside the yoke-beasts went her man, a well-knit trim-faced Dalesman clad\r\nbravely in holiday raiment, girt with a goodly sword, bearing a bright\r\nsteel helm on his head, in his hand a long spear with a gay red and white\r\nshaft done about with copper bands.  He looked merry and proud of his\r\nwain-load, and the woman was smiling kindly on him from out of her\r\nscarlet and fur; but now she turned a weary happy face on Gold-mane, for\r\nthey knew him, as did all men of the Dale.\r\n\r\nSo he stopped when they met, for the goodman had already stayed his slow\r\nbeasts, and the goodwife had risen a little on her cushions to greet him,\r\nyet slowly and but a little, for she was great with child, and not far\r\nfrom her time.  That knew Gold-mane well, and what was toward, and why\r\nthe goodman wore his fine clothes, and why the wain was decked with\r\noak-boughs and the yoke-beasts with their best gilded bells and\r\ncopper-adorned harness.  For it was a custom with many of the kindreds\r\nthat the goodwife should fare to her father\xe2\x80\x99s house to lie in with her\r\nfirst babe, and the day of her coming home was made a great feast in the\r\nhouse.  So then Face-of-god cried out: \xe2\x80\x98Hail to thee, O Warcliff!  Shrewd\r\nis the wind this morning, and thou dost well to heed it carefully, this\r\nthine orchard, this thy garden, this thy fair apple-tree!  To a good hall\r\nthou wendest, and the Wine of Increase shall be sweet there this even.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen smiled Warcliff all across his face, and the goodwife hung her head\r\nand reddened.  Said the goodman: \xe2\x80\x98Wilt thou not be with us, son of the\r\nAlderman, as surely thy father shall be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98though I were fain of it: my own matters carry\r\nme away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What matters?\xe2\x80\x99 said Warcliff; \xe2\x80\x98perchance thou art for the cities this\r\nautumn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god answered somewhat stiffly: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, I am not;\xe2\x80\x99 and then more\r\nkindly, and smiling, \xe2\x80\x98All roads lead not down to the Plain, friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What road then farest thou away from us?\xe2\x80\x99 said the goodwife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The way of my will,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what way is that?\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98take heed, lest I get a longing to\r\nknow.  For then must thou needs tell me, or deal with the carle there\r\nbeside thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, goodwife,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98let not that longing take thee; for\r\non that matter I am even as wise as thou.  Now good speed to thee and to\r\nthe new-comer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he went close up to the wain, and reached out his hand to her,\r\nand she gave him hers and he kissed it, and so went his ways smiling\r\nkindly on them.  Then the carle cried to his kine, and they bent down\r\ntheir heads to the yoke; and presently, as he walked on, he heard the\r\nrumble of the wain mingling with the tinkling of their bells, which in a\r\nlittle while became measured and musical, and sounded above the creaking\r\nof the axles and the rattle of the gear and the roll of the great wheels\r\nover the road: and so it grew thinner and thinner till it all died away\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nHe was now come to where the river turned away from the sheer rock-wall,\r\nwhich was not so high there as in most other places, as there had been in\r\nold time long screes from the cliff, which had now grown together, with\r\nthe waxing of herbs and the washing down of the earth on to them, and\r\nmade a steady slope or low hill going down riverward.  Over this the road\r\nlifted itself above the level of the meadows, keeping a little way from\r\nthe cliffs, while on the other side its bank was somewhat broken and\r\nsteep here and there.  As Face-of-god came up to one of these broken\r\nplaces, the sun rose over the eastern pass, and the meadows grew golden\r\nwith its long beams.  He lingered, and looked back under his hand, and as\r\nhe did so heard the voices and laughter of women coming up from the slope\r\nbelow him, and presently a young woman came struggling up the broken bank\r\nwith hand and knee, and cast herself down on the roadside turf laughing\r\nand panting.  She was a long-limbed light-made woman, dark-faced and\r\nblack-haired: amidst her laughter she looked up and saw Gold-mane, who\r\nhad stopped at once when he saw her; she held out her hands to him, and\r\nsaid lightly, though her face flushed withal:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come hither, thou, and help the others to climb the bank; for they are\r\nbeaten in the race, and now must they do after my will; that was the\r\nforfeit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went up to her, and took her hands and kissed them, as was the custom\r\nof the Dale, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hail to thee, Long-coat! who be they, and whither away this morning\r\nearly?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked hard at him, and fondly belike, as she answered slowly: \xe2\x80\x98They\r\nbe the two maidens of my father\xe2\x80\x99s house, whom thou knowest; and our\r\nerrand, all three of us, is to Burgstead, the Feast of the Wine of\r\nIncrease which shall be drunk this even.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she spake came another woman half up the bank, to whom went\r\nFace-of-god, and, taking her hands, drew her up while she laughed merrily\r\nin his face: he saluted her as he had Long-coat, and then with a laugh\r\nturned about to wait for the third; who came indeed, but after a little\r\nwhile, for she had abided, hearing their voices.  Her also Gold-mane drew\r\nup, and kissed her hands, and she lay on the grass by Long-coat, but the\r\nsecond maiden stood up beside the young man.  She was white-skinned and\r\ngolden-haired, a very fair damsel, whereas the last-comer was but comely,\r\nas were well-nigh all the women of the Dale.\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god, looking on the three: \xe2\x80\x98How comes it, maidens, that ye\r\nare but in your kirtles this sharp autumn morning? or where have ye left\r\nyour gowns or your cloaks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor indeed they were clad but in close-fitting blue kirtles of fine wool,\r\nembroidered about the hems with gold and coloured threads.\r\n\r\nThe last-comer laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98What ails thee, Gold-mane, to be so\r\ncareful of us, as if thou wert our mother or our nurse?  Yet if thou must\r\nneeds know, there hang our gowns on the thorn-bush down yonder; for we\r\nhave been running a match and a forfeit; to wit, that she who was last on\r\nthe highway should go down again and bring them up all three; and now\r\nthat is my day\xe2\x80\x99s work: but since thou art here, Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s son, thou\r\nshalt go down instead of me and fetch them up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut he laughed merrily and outright, and said: \xe2\x80\x98That will I not, for\r\nthere be but twenty-four hours in the day, and what between eating and\r\ndrinking and talking to fair maidens, I have enough to do in every one of\r\nthem.  Wasteful are ye women, and simple is your forfeit.  Now will I,\r\nwho am the Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s son, give forth a doom, and will ordain that one of\r\nyou fetch up the gowns yourselves, and that Long-coat be the one; for she\r\nis the fleetest-footed and ablest thereto.  Will ye take my doom? for\r\nlater on I shall not be wiser.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fair woman, \xe2\x80\x98not because thou art the Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s son, but\r\nbecause thou art the fairest man of the Dale, and mayst bid us poor souls\r\nwhat thou wilt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god reddened at her words, and the speaker and the last-comer\r\nlaughed; but Long-coat held her peace: she cast one very sober look on\r\nhim, and then ran lightly down the bent; he drew near the edge of it, and\r\nwatched her going; for her light-foot slimness was fair to look on: and\r\nhe noted that when she was nigh the thorn-bush whereon hung the\r\nbright-broidered gowns, and deemed belike that she was not seen, she\r\nkissed both her hands where he had kissed them erst.\r\n\r\nThereat he drew aback and turned away shyly, scarce looking at the other\r\ntwain, who smiled on him with somewhat jeering looks; but he bade them\r\nfarewell and departed speedily; and if they spoke, it was but softly, for\r\nhe heard their voices no more.\r\n\r\nHe went on under the sunlight which was now gilding the outstanding\r\nstones of the cliffs, and still his mind was set upon the Bride; and his\r\nmeeting with the mother of the yet unborn baby, and with the three women\r\nwith their freshness and fairness, did somehow turn his thought the more\r\nupon her, since she was the woman who was to be his amongst all women,\r\nfor she was far fairer than any one of them; and through all manner of\r\nlife and through all kinds of deeds would he be with her, and know more\r\nof her fairness and kindness than any other could: and him-seemed he\r\ncould see pictures of her and of him amidst all these deeds and ways.\r\n\r\nNow he went very swiftly; for he was eager, though he knew not for what,\r\nand he thought but little of the things on which his eyes fell.  He met\r\nnone else on the road till he was come to Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way, though he saw\r\nfolk enough down in the meadows; he was soon amidst the first of the\r\ntrees, and without making any stay set his face east and somewhat north,\r\nthat is, toward the slopes that led to the great mountains.  He said to\r\nhimself aloud, as he wended the wood: \xe2\x80\x98Strange! yestereven I thought much\r\nof the wood, and I set my mind on not going thither, and this morning I\r\nthought nothing of it, and here am I amidst its trees, and wending\r\ntowards its innermost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis way was easy at first, because the wood for a little space was all of\r\nbeech, so that there was no undergrowth, and he went lightly betwixt the\r\ntall grey and smooth boles; albeit his heart was nought so gay as it was\r\nin the dale amidst the sunshine.  After a while the beech-wood grew\r\nthinner, and at last gave out altogether, and he came into a space of\r\nrough broken ground with nought but a few scrubby oaks and thorn-bushes\r\ngrowing thereon here and there.  The sun was high in the heavens now, and\r\nshone brightly down on the waste, though there were a few white clouds\r\nhigh up above him.  The rabbits scuttled out of the grass before him;\r\nhere and there he turned aside from a stone on which lay coiled an adder\r\nsunning itself; now and again both hart and hind bounded away from before\r\nhim, or a sounder of wild swine ran grunting away toward closer covert.\r\nBut nought did he see but the common sights and sounds of the woodland;\r\nnor did he look for aught else, for he knew this part of the woodland\r\nindifferent well.\r\n\r\nHe held on over this treeless waste for an hour or more, when the ground\r\nbegan to be less rugged, and he came upon trees again, but thinly\r\nscattered, oak and ash and hornbeam not right great, with thickets of\r\nholly and blackthorn between them.  The set of the ground was still\r\nsteadily up to the east and north-east, and he followed it as one who\r\nwendeth an assured way.  At last before him seemed to rise a wall of\r\ntrees and thicket; but when he drew near to it, lo! an opening in a\r\ncertain place, and a little path as if men were wont to thread the tangle\r\nof the wood thereby; though hitherto he had noted no slot of men, nor any\r\nsign of them, since he had plunged into the deep of the beech-wood.  He\r\ntook the path as one who needs must, and went his ways as it led.  In\r\nsooth it was well-nigh blind, but he was a deft woodsman, and by means of\r\nit skirted many a close thicket that had otherwise stayed him.  So on he\r\nwent, and though the boughs were close enough overhead, and the sun came\r\nthrough but in flecks, he judged that it was growing towards noon, and he\r\nwotted well that he was growing aweary.  For he had been long afoot, and\r\nthe more part of the time on a rough way, or breasting a slope which was\r\nat whiles steep enough.\r\n\r\nAt last the track led him skirting about an exceeding close thicket into\r\na small clearing, through which ran a little woodland rill amidst rushes\r\nand dead leaves: there was a low mound near the eastern side of this\r\nwood-lawn, as though there had been once a dwelling of man there, but no\r\nother sign or slot of man was there.\r\n\r\nSo Face-of-god made stay in that place, casting himself down beside the\r\nrill to rest him and eat and drink somewhat.  Whatever thoughts had been\r\nwith him through the wood (and they been many) concerning his House and\r\nhis name, and his father, and the journey he might make to the cities of\r\nthe Westland, and what was to befall him when he was wedded, and what war\r\nor trouble should be on his hands\xe2\x80\x94all this was now mingled together and\r\nconfused by this rest amidst his weariness.  He laid down his scrip, and\r\ndrew his meat from it and ate what he would, and dipping his gilded\r\nbeaker into the brook, drank water smacking of the damp musty savour of\r\nthe woodland; and then his head sank back on a little mound in the short\r\nturf, and he fell asleep at once.  A long dream he had in short space;\r\nand therein were blent his thoughts of the morning with the deeds of\r\nyesterday; and other matters long forgotten in his waking hours came back\r\nto his slumber in unordered confusion: all which made up for him pictures\r\nclear, but of little meaning, save that, as oft befalls in dreams,\r\nwhatever he was a-doing he felt himself belated.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, smiling at something strange in his gone-by dream, he\r\nlooked up to the heavens, thinking to see signs of the even at hand, for\r\nhe seemed to have been dreaming so long.  The sky was thinly overcast by\r\nnow, but by his wonted woodcraft he knew the whereabouts of the sun, and\r\nthat it was scant an hour after noon.  He sat there till he was wholly\r\nawake, and then drank once more of the woodland water; and he said to\r\nhimself, but out loud, for he was fain of the sound of a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\r\nthough it were but his own:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is mine errand hither?  Whither wend I?  What shall I have done\r\nto-morrow that I have hitherto left undone?  Or what manner of man shall\r\nI be then other than I am now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet though he said the words he failed to think the thought, or it left\r\nhim in a moment of time, and he thought but of the Bride and her\r\nkindness.  Yet that abode with him but a moment, and again he saw himself\r\nand those two women on the highway edge, and Long-coat lingering on the\r\nslope below, kissing his kisses on her hands; and he was sorry that she\r\ndesired him over-much, for she was a fair woman and a friendly.  But all\r\nthat also flowed from him at once, and he had no thought in him but that\r\nhe also desired something that he lacked: and this was a burden to him,\r\nand he rose up frowning, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98Am I become a mere sport\r\nof dreams, whether I sleep or wake?  I will go backward\xe2\x80\x94or forward, but\r\nwill think no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he ordered his gear again, and took the path onward and upward\r\ntoward the Great Mountains; and the track was even fainter than before\r\nfor a while, so that he had to seek his way diligently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.  FACE-OF-GOD FALLS IN WITH MENFOLK ON THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW he plodded on steadily, and for a long time the forest changed but\r\nlittle, and of wild things he saw only a few of those that love the\r\nclosest covert.  The ground still went up and up, though at whiles were\r\nhollows, and steeper bents out of them again, and the half-blind path or\r\nslot still led past the close thickets and fallen trees, and he made way\r\nwithout let or hindrance.  At last once more the wood began to thin, and\r\nthe trees themselves to be smaller and gnarled and ill-grown: therewithal\r\nthe day was waning, and the sky was quite clear again as the afternoon\r\ngrew into a fair autumn evening.\r\n\r\nNow the trees failed altogether, and the slope grown steeper was covered\r\nwith heather and ling; and looking up, he saw before him quite near by\r\nseeming in the clear even (though indeed they were yet far away) the\r\nsnowy peaks flushed with the sinking sun against the frosty dark-grey\r\neastern sky; and below them the dark rock-mountains, and below these\r\nagain, and nigh to him indeed, the fells covered with pine-woods and\r\nlooking like a wall to the heaths he trod.\r\n\r\nHe stayed a little while and turned his head to look at the way whereby\r\nhe had come; but that way a swell of the oak-forest hid everything but\r\nthe wood itself, making a wall behind him as the pine-wood made a wall\r\nbefore.  There came across him then a sharp memory of the boding words\r\nwhich Stone-face had spoken last night, and he felt as if he were now\r\nindeed within the trap.  But presently he laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98I am a fool:\r\nthis comes of being alone in the dark wood and the dismal waste, after\r\nthe merry faces of the Dale had swept away my foolish musings of\r\nyesterday and the day before.  Lo! here I stand, a man of the Face, sword\r\nand axe by my side; if death come, it can but come once; and if I fear\r\nnot death, what shall make me afraid?  The Gods hate me not, and will not\r\nhurt me; and they are not ugly, but beauteous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he strode on again, and soon came to a place where the ground\r\nsank into a shallow valley and the ling gave place to grass for a while,\r\nand there were tall old pines scattered about, and betwixt them grey\r\nrocks; this he passed through, climbing a steep bent out of it, and the\r\npines were all about him now, though growing wide apart, till at last he\r\ncame to where they thickened into a wood, not very close, wherethrough he\r\nwent merrily, singing to himself and swinging his spear.  He was soon\r\nthrough this wood, and came on to a wide well-grassed wood-lawn, hedged\r\nby the wood aforesaid on three sides, but sloping up slowly toward the\r\nblack wall of the thicker pine-wood on the fourth side, and about half a\r\nfurlong overthwart and endlong.  The sun had set while he was in the last\r\nwood, but it was still broad daylight on the wood-lawn, and as he stood\r\nthere he was ware of a house under the pine-wood on the other side, built\r\nlong and low, much like the houses of the Woodland-Carles, but rougher\r\nfashioned and of unhewn trees.  He gazed on it, and said aloud to himself\r\nas his wont was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marvellous! here is a dwelling of man, scarce a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey from\r\nBurgstead; yet have I never heard tell of it: may happen some of the\r\nWoodland-Carles have built it, and are on some errand of hunting peltries\r\nup in the mountains, or maybe are seeking copper and tin among the rocks.\r\nWell, at least let us go see what manner of men dwell there, and if they\r\nare minded for a guest to-night; for fain were I of a bed beneath a roof,\r\nand of a board with strong meat and drink on it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he set forward, not heeding much that the wood he had passed\r\nthrough was hard on his left hand; but he had gone but twenty paces when\r\nhe saw a red thing at the edge of the wood, and then a glitter, and a\r\nspear came whistling forth, and smote his own spear so hard close to the\r\nsteel that it flew out of his hand; then came a great shout, and a man\r\nclad in a scarlet kirtle ran forth on him.  Face-of-god had his axe in\r\nhis hand in a twinkling, and ran at once to meet his foe; but the man had\r\nthe hill on his side as he rushed on with a short-sword in his hand.  Axe\r\nand sword clashed together for a moment of time, and then both the men\r\nrolled over on the grass together, and Face-of-god as he fell deemed that\r\nhe heard the shrill cry of a woman.  Now Face-of-god found that he was\r\nthe nethermost, for if he was strong, yet was his foe stronger; the axe\r\nhad flown out of his hand also, while the strange man still kept a hold\r\nof his short-sword; and presently, though he still struggled all he\r\ncould, he saw the man draw back his hand to smite with the said sword;\r\nand at that nick of time the foeman\xe2\x80\x99s knee was on his breast, his left\r\nhand was doubled back behind him, and his right wrist was gripped hard in\r\nthe stranger\xe2\x80\x99s left hand.  Even therewith his ears, sharpened by the\r\ncoming death, heard the sound of footsteps and fluttering raiment drawing\r\nnear; something dark came between him and the sky; there was the sound of\r\na great stroke, and the big man loosened his grip and fell off him to one\r\nside.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god leapt up and ran to his axe and got hold of it; but turning\r\nround found himself face to face with a tall woman holding in her hand a\r\nstout staff like the limb of a tree.  She was calm and smiling, though\r\nforsooth it was she who had stricken the stroke and stayed the sword from\r\nhis throat.  His hand and axe dropped down to his side when he saw what\r\nit was that faced him, and that the woman was young and fair; so he spake\r\nto her and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What aileth, maiden? is this man thy foe? doth he oppress thee? shall I\r\nslay him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou art open-handed in thy proffers: he might\r\nhave asked the like concerning thee but a minute ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane, laughing also, \xe2\x80\x98but he asked it not of thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is sooth,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but since thou hast asked me, I will tell\r\nthee that if thou slay him it will be my harm as well as his; and in my\r\ncountry a man that taketh a gift is not wont to break the giver\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nwith it straightway.  The man is my brother, O stranger, and presently,\r\nif thou wilt, thou mayst be eating at the same board with him.  Or if\r\nthou wilt, thou mayst go thy ways unhurt into the wood.  But I had liefer\r\nof the twain that thou wert in our house to-night; for thou hast a wrong\r\nagainst us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer voice was sweet and clear, and she spake the last words kindly, and\r\ndrew somewhat nigher to Gold-mane.  Therewithal the smitten man sat up,\r\nand put his hand to his head, and quoth he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Angry is my sister! good it is to wear the helm abroad when she shaketh\r\nthe nut-trees.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98it is thy luck that thou wert bare-headed, else had I\r\nbeen forced to smite thee on the face.  Thou churl, since when hath it\r\nbeen our wont to thrust knives into a guest, who is come of great kin, a\r\nman of gentle heart and fair face?  Come hither and handsel him self-doom\r\nfor thy fool\xe2\x80\x99s onset!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man rose to his feet and said: \xe2\x80\x98Well, sister, least said, soonest\r\nmended.  A clout on the head is worse than a woman\xe2\x80\x99s chiding; but since\r\nye have given me one, ye may forbear the other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he drew near to them.  He was a very big-made man, most\r\nstalwarth, with dark red hair and a thin pointed beard; his nose was\r\nstraight and fine, his eyes grey and well-opened, but somewhat fierce\r\nwithal.  Yet was he in nowise evil-looking; he seemed some thirty summers\r\nold.  He was clad in a short scarlet kirtle, a goodly garment, with a\r\nhood of like web pulled off his head on to his shoulders: he bore a great\r\ngold ring on his left arm, and a collar of gold came down on to his\r\nbreast from under his hood.\r\n\r\nAs for the woman, she was clad in a long white linen smock, and over it a\r\nshort gown of dark blue woollen, and she had skin shoes on her feet.\r\n\r\nNow the man came up to Face-of-god, and took his hand and said: \xe2\x80\x98I deemed\r\nthee a foe, and I may not have over-many foes alive: but it seems that\r\nthou art to be a friend, and that is well and better; so herewith I\r\nhandsel thee self-doom in the matter of the onslaught.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98The doom is soon given forth; against\r\nthe tumble on the grass I set the clout on the head; there is nought left\r\nover to pay to any man\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the scarlet-clad man: \xe2\x80\x98Belike by thine eyes thou art a true man, and\r\nwilt not bewray me.  Now is there no foeman here, but rather maybe a\r\nfriend both now and in time to come.\xe2\x80\x99  Therewith he cast his arms about\r\nFace-of-god and kissed him.  But Face-of-god turned about to the woman\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Is the peace wholly made?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and said soberly: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, thou art too fair for a woman\r\nto kiss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe flushed red, as his wont was when a woman praised him; yet was his\r\nheart full of pleasure and well-liking.  But she laid her hand on his\r\nshoulder and said: \xe2\x80\x98Now is it for thee to choose betwixt the wild-wood\r\nand the hall, and whether thou wilt be a guest or a wayfarer this night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she touched him there took hold of him a sweetness of pleasure he had\r\nnever felt erst, and he answered: \xe2\x80\x98I will be thy guest and not thy\r\nstranger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come then,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and took his hand in hers, so that he scarce felt\r\nthe earth under his feet, as they went all three together toward the\r\nhouse in the gathering dusk, while eastward where the peaks of the great\r\nmountains dipped was a light that told of the rising of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.  OF FACE-OF-GOD AND THOSE MOUNTAIN-DWELLERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA YARD or two from the threshold Gold-mane hung back a moment, entangled\r\nin some such misgiving as a man is wont to feel when he is just about to\r\ndo some new deed, but is not yet deep in the story; his new friends noted\r\nthat, for they smiled each in their own way, and the woman drew her hand\r\naway from his.  Face-of-god held out his still as though to take hers\r\nagain, and therewithal he changed countenance and said as though he had\r\nstayed but to ask that question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me thy name, tall man; and thou, fair woman, tell me thine; for how\r\ncan we talk together else?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man laughed outright and said: \xe2\x80\x98The young chieftain thinks that this\r\nhouse also should be his!  Nay, young man, I know what is in thy thought,\r\nbe not ashamed that thou art wary; and be assured!  We shall hurt thee no\r\nmore than thou hast been hurt.  Now as to my name; the name that was born\r\nwith me is gone: the name that was given me hath been taken from me: now\r\nI belike must give myself a name, and that shall be Wild-wearer; but it\r\nmay be that thou thyself shalt one day give me another, and call me\r\nGuest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis sister gazed at him solemnly as he spoke, and Face-of-god beholding\r\nher the while, deemed that her beauty grew and grew till she seemed as\r\naweful as a Goddess; and into his mind it came that this over-strong man\r\nand over-lovely woman were nought mortal, and they withal dealing with\r\nhim as father and mother deal with a wayward child: then for a moment his\r\nheart failed him, and he longed for the peace of Burgdale, and even the\r\nlonely wood.  But therewith she turned to him and let her hand come into\r\nhis again, and looked kindly on him and said: \xe2\x80\x98And as for me, call me the\r\nFriend; the name is good and will serve for many things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked down from her face and his eyes lighted on her hand, and when\r\nhe noted even amid the evening dusk how fair and lovely it was fashioned,\r\nand yet as though it were deft in the crafts that the daughters of\r\nmenfolk use, his fear departed, and the pleasure of his longing filled\r\nhis heart, and he drew her hand to him to kiss it; but she held it back.\r\nThen he said: \xe2\x80\x98It is the custom of the Dale to all women.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo she let him kiss her hand, heeding the kiss nothing, and said soberly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then art thou of Burgdale, and if it were lawful to guess, I would say\r\nthat thy name is Face-of-god, of the House of the Face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even so it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but in the Dale those that love me do mostly\r\ncall me Gold-mane.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well named,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and seldom wilt thou be called otherwise,\r\nfor thou wilt be well-beloved.  But come in now, Gold-mane, for night is\r\nat hand, and here have we meat and lodging such as an hungry and weary\r\nman may take; though we be broken people, dwellers in the waste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she led him gently over the threshold into the hall, and it\r\nseemed to him as if she were the fairest and the noblest of all the\r\nQueens of ancient story.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in the house he looked and saw that, rough as it was without\r\nit lacked not fairness within.  The floor was of hard-trodden earth\r\nstrewn with pine-twigs, and with here and there brown bearskins laid on\r\nit: there was a standing table near the upper end athwart the hall, and a\r\ndays beyond that, but no endlong table.  Gold-mane looked to the\r\nshut-beds, and saw that they were large and fair, though there were but a\r\nfew of them; and at the lower end was a loft for a sleeping chamber dight\r\nvery fairly with broidered cloths.  The hangings on the walls, though\r\nthey left some places bare which were hung with fresh boughs, were fairer\r\nthan any he had ever seen, so that he deemed that they must come from far\r\ncountries and the City of Cities: therein were images wrought of warriors\r\nand fair women of old time and their dealings with the Gods and the\r\nGiants, and Wondrous wights; and he deemed that this was the story of\r\nsome great kindred, and that their token and the sign of their banner\r\nmust needs be the Wood-wolf, for everywhere was it wrought in these\r\npictured webs.  Perforce he looked long and earnestly at these fair\r\nthings, for the hall was not dark yet, because the brands on the hearth\r\nwere flaming their last, and when Wild-wearer beheld him so gazing, he\r\nstood up and looked too for a moment, and then smote his right hand on\r\nthe hilt of his sword, and turned away and strode up and down the hall as\r\none in angry thought.\r\n\r\nBut the woman, even the Friend, bestirred herself for the service of the\r\nguest, and brought water for his hands and feet, and when she had washed\r\nhim, bore him the wine of Welcome and drank to him and bade him drink;\r\nand he all the while was shamefaced; for it was to him as if one of the\r\nLadies of the Heavenly Burg were doing him service.  Then she went away\r\nby a door at the lower end of the hall, and Wild-wearer came and sat down\r\nby Gold-mane, and fell a-talking with him about the ways of the Dalesmen,\r\nand their garths, and the pastures and growths thereof; and what temper\r\nthe carles themselves were of; which were good men, which were ill, which\r\nwas loved and which scorned; no otherwise than if he had been the goodman\r\nof some neighbouring dale; and Gold-mane told him whatso he knew, for he\r\nsaw no harm therein.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the outer door opened, and there came in a woman of some\r\nfive-and-twenty winters, trimly and strongly built; short-skirted she was\r\nand clad as a hunter, with a bow in her hand and a quiver at her back:\r\nshe unslung a pouch, which she emptied at Wild-wearer\xe2\x80\x99s feet of a leash\r\nof hares and two brace of mountain grouse; of Face-of-god she took but\r\nlittle heed.\r\n\r\nSaid Wild-wearer: \xe2\x80\x98This is good for to-morrow, not for to-day; the meat\r\nis well-nigh on the board.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Gold-mane smiled, for he called to mind his home-coming of\r\nyesterday.  But the woman said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fault is not mine; she told me of the coming guest but three hours\r\nagone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wild-wearer, \xe2\x80\x98she looked for a guest then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, certes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the woman, \xe2\x80\x98else why went I forth this afternoon, as\r\nwearied as I was with yesterday?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wild-wearer, \xe2\x80\x98get to thy due work or go play; I meddle\r\nnot with meat! and for thee all jests are as bitter earnest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And with thee, chief,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98it is no otherwise; surely I am made\r\non thy model.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thy tongue is longer, friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98now tarry if thou wilt, and if\r\nthe supper\xe2\x80\x99s service craveth thee not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned away with one keen look at Face-of-god, and departed through\r\nthe door at the lower end of the hall.\r\n\r\nBy this time the hall was dusk, for there were no candles there, and the\r\nhearth-fire was but smouldering.  Wild-wearer sat silent and musing now,\r\nand Face-of-god spake not, for he was deep in wild and happy dreams.  At\r\nlast the lower door opened and the fair woman came into the hall with a\r\ntorch in either hand, after whom came the huntress, now clad in a dark\r\nblue kirtle, and an old woman yet straight and hale; and these twain bore\r\nin the victuals and the table-gear.  Then the three fell to dighting the\r\nboard, and when it was all ready, and Gold-mane and Wild-wearer were set\r\ndown to it, and with them the fair woman and the huntress, the old woman\r\nthrew good store of fresh brands on the hearth, so that the light shone\r\ninto every corner; and even therewith the outer door opened, and four\r\nmore men entered, whereof one was old, but big and stalwarth, the other\r\nthree young: they were all clad roughly in sheep-brown weed, but had\r\nhelms upon their heads and spears in their hands and great swords girt to\r\ntheir sides; and they seemed doughty men and ready for battle.  One of\r\nthe young men cast down by the door the carcass of a big-horned mountain\r\nsheep, and then they all trooped off to the out-bower by the lower door,\r\nand came back presently fairly clad and without their weapons.\r\nWild-wearer nodded to them kindly, and they sat at table paying no more\r\nheed to Face-of-god than to cast him a nod for salutation.\r\n\r\nThen said the old woman to them: \xe2\x80\x98Well, lads, have ye been doing or\r\nsleeping?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sleeping, mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said one of the young men, \xe2\x80\x98as was but due after last\r\nnight was, and to-morrow shall be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the huntress: \xe2\x80\x98Hold thy peace, Wood-wise, and let thy tongue help\r\nthy teeth to deal with thy meat; for this is not the talking hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, Bow-may,\xe2\x80\x99 said another of the swains, \xe2\x80\x98since here is a new man, now\r\nis the time to talk to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the huntress: \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis thine hands that talk best, Wood-wont; it is not\r\nthey that shall bring thee to shame.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSpake the third: \xe2\x80\x98What have we to do with shame here, far away from dooms\r\nand doomers, and elders, and wardens, and guarded castles?  If the new\r\nman listeth to speak, let him speak; or to fight, then let him; it shall\r\never be man to man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen spake the old woman: \xe2\x80\x98Son Wood-wicked, hold thy peace, and forget\r\nthe steel that ever eggeth thee on to draw.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she set the last matters on the board, while the three swains\r\nsat and eyed Gold-mane somewhat fiercely, now that words had stirred\r\nthem, and he had sat there saying nothing, as one who was better than\r\nthey, and contemned them; but now spake Wild-wearer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whoso hungreth let him eat!  Whoso would slumber, let him to bed.  But\r\nhe who would bicker, it must needs be with me.  Here is a man of the\r\nDale, who hath sought the wood in peace, and hath found us.  His hand is\r\nready and his heart is guileless: if ye fear him, run away to the wood,\r\nand come back when he is gone; but none shall mock him while I sit by:\r\nnow, lads, be merry and blithe with the guest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the young men greeted Gold-mane, and the old man said: \xe2\x80\x98Art thou of\r\nBurgstead? then wilt thou be of the House of the Face, and thy name will\r\nbe Face-of-god; for that man is called the fairest of the Dale, and there\r\nshall be none fairer than thou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98There be but few mirrors in Burgdale, and\r\nI have no mind to journey west to the cities to see what manner of man I\r\nbe: that were ill husbandry.  But now I have heard the names of the three\r\nswains, tell me thy name, father!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSpake the huntress: \xe2\x80\x98This is my father\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and his name is\r\nWood-father; or ye shall call him so: and I am called Bow-may because I\r\nshoot well in the bow: and this old carline is my eme\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and now\r\nbelike my mother, if I need one.  But thou, fair-faced Dalesman, little\r\ndost thou need a mirror in the Dale so long as women abide there; for\r\ntheir faces shall be instead of mirrors to tell thee whether thou be fair\r\nand lovely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereat they all laughed and fell to their victual, which was abundant,\r\nof wood-venison and mountain-fowl, but of bread was no great plenty; wine\r\nlacked not, and that of the best; and Gold-mane noted that the cups and\r\nthe apparel of the horns and mazers were not of gold nor gilded copper,\r\nbut of silver; and he marvelled thereat, for in the Dale silver was rare.\r\n\r\nSo they ate and drank, and Gold-mane looked ever on the Friend, and spake\r\nmuch with her, and he deemed her friendly indeed, and she seemed most\r\npleased when he spoke best, and led him on to do so.  Wild-wearer was but\r\nof few words, and those somewhat harsh; yet was he as a man striving to\r\nbe courteous and blithe; but of the others Bow-may was the greatest\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\nWild-wearer called healths to the Sun, and the Moon, and the Hosts of\r\nHeaven; to the Gods of the Earth; to the Woodwights; and to the Guest.\r\nOther healths also he called, the meaning of which was dark to Gold-mane;\r\nto wit, the Jaws of the Wolf; the Silver Arm; the Red Hand; the Golden\r\nBushel; and the Ragged Sword.  But when he asked the Friend concerning\r\nthese names what they might signify, she shook her head and answered not.\r\n\r\nAt last Wild-wearer cried out: \xe2\x80\x98Now, lads, the night weareth and the\r\nguest is weary: therefore whoso of you hath in him any minstrelsy, now\r\nlet him make it, for later on it shall be over-late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen arose Wood-wont and went to his shut-bed and groped therein, and\r\ntook from out of it a fiddle in its case; and he opened the case and drew\r\nfrom it a very goodly fiddle, and he stood on the floor amidst of the\r\nhall and Bow-may his cousin with him; and he laid his bow on the fiddle\r\nand woke up song in it, and when it was well awake she fell a-singing,\r\nand he to answering her song, and at the last all they of the house sang\r\ntogether; and this is the meaning of the words which they sang:\r\n\r\n                              _She singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Now is the rain upon the day,\r\n      And every water\xe2\x80\x99s wide;\r\n   Why busk ye then to wear the way,\r\n      And whither will ye ride?\r\n\r\n                              _He singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Our kine are on the eyot still,\r\n      The eddies lap them round;\r\n   All dykes the wind-worn waters fill,\r\n      And waneth grass and ground.\r\n\r\n                              _She singeth_.\r\n\r\n   O ride ye to the river\xe2\x80\x99s brim\r\n      In war-weed fair to see?\r\n   Or winter waters will ye swim\r\n      In hauberks to the knee?\r\n\r\n                              _He singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Wild is the day, and dim with rain,\r\n      Our sheep are warded ill;\r\n   The wood-wolves gather for the plain,\r\n      Their ravening maws to fill.\r\n\r\n                              _She singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Nay, what is this, and what have ye,\r\n      A hunter\xe2\x80\x99s band, to bear\r\n   The Banner of our Battle-glee\r\n      The skulking wolves to scare?\r\n\r\n                              _He singeth_.\r\n\r\n   O women, when we wend our ways\r\n      To deal with death and dread,\r\n   The Banner of our Fathers\xe2\x80\x99 Days\r\n      Must flap the wind o\xe2\x80\x99erhead.\r\n\r\n                              _She singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Ah, for the maidens that ye leave!\r\n      Who now shall save the hay?\r\n   What grooms shall kiss our lips at eve,\r\n      When June hath mastered May?\r\n\r\n                              _He singeth_.\r\n\r\n   The wheat is won, the seed is sown,\r\n      Here toileth many a maid,\r\n   And ere the hay knee-deep hath grown\r\n      Your grooms the grass shall wade.\r\n\r\n                        _They sing all together_.\r\n\r\n   Then fair befall the mountain-side\r\n      Whereon the play shall be!\r\n   And fair befall the summer-tide\r\n      That whoso lives shall see.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god thought the song goodly, but to the others it was well known.\r\nThen said Wood-father:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O foster-son, thy foster-brother hath sung well for a wood abider; but\r\nwe are deeming that his singing shall be but as a starling to a throstle\r\nmatched against thy new-come guest.  Therefore, Dalesman, sing us a song\r\nof the Dale, and if ye will, let it be of gardens and pleasant houses of\r\nstone, and fair damsels therein, and swains with them who toil not\r\nover-much for a scant livelihood, as do they of the waste, whose heads\r\nmay not be seen in the Holy Places.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98Father, it is ill to set the words of a lonely man afar\r\nfrom his kin against the song that cometh from the heart of a noble\r\nhouse; yet may I not gainsay thee, but will sing to thee what I may call\r\nto mind, and it is called the Song of the Ford.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he sang in a sweet and clear voice: and this is the meaning of\r\nhis words:\r\n\r\n   In hay-tide, through the day new-born,\r\n      Across the meads we come;\r\n   Our hauberks brush the blossomed corn\r\n      A furlong short of home.\r\n\r\n   Ere yet the gables we behold\r\n      Forth flasheth the red sun,\r\n   And smites our fallow helms and cold\r\n      Though all the fight be done.\r\n\r\n   In this last mend of mowing-grass\r\n      Sweet doth the clover smell,\r\n   Crushed neath our feet red with the pass\r\n      Where hell was blent with hell.\r\n\r\n   And now the willowy stream is nigh,\r\n      Down wend we to the ford;\r\n   No shafts across its fishes fly,\r\n      Nor flasheth there a sword.\r\n\r\n   But lo! what gleameth on the bank\r\n      Across the water wan,\r\n   As when our blood the mouse-ear drank\r\n      And red the river ran?\r\n\r\n   Nay, hasten to the ripple clear,\r\n      Look at the grass beyond!\r\n   Lo ye the dainty band and dear\r\n      Of maidens fair and fond!\r\n\r\n   Lo how they needs must take the stream!\r\n      The water hides their feet;\r\n   On fair kind arms the gold doth gleam,\r\n      And midst the ford we meet.\r\n\r\n   Up through the garden two and two,\r\n      And on the flowers we drip;\r\n   Their wet feet kiss the morning dew\r\n      As lip lies close to lip.\r\n\r\n   Here now we sing; here now we stay:\r\n      By these grey walls we tell\r\n   The love that lived from out the fray,\r\n      The love that fought and fell.\r\n\r\nWhen he was done they all said that he had sung well, and that the song\r\nwas sweet.  Yet did Wild-wearer smile somewhat; and Bow-may said\r\noutright: \xe2\x80\x98Soft is the song, and hath been made by lads and minstrels\r\nrather than by warriors.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, kinswoman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wood-father, \xe2\x80\x98thou art hard to please; the guest\r\nis kind, and hath given us that I asked for, and I give him all thanks\r\ntherefor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god smiled, but he heeded little what they said, for as he sang\r\nhe had noted that the Friend looked kindly on him; and he thought he saw\r\nthat once or twice she put out her hand as if to touch him, but drew it\r\nback again each time.  She spake after a little and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here now hath been a stream of song running betwixt the Mountain and the\r\nDale even as doth a river; and this is good to come between our dreams of\r\nwhat hath been and what shall be.\xe2\x80\x99  Then she turned to Gold-mane, and\r\nsaid to him scarce loud enough for all to hear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Herewith I bid thee good-night, O Dalesman; and this other word I have\r\nto thee: heed not what befalleth in the night, but sleep thy best, for\r\nnought shall be to thy scathe.  And when thou wakest in the morning, if\r\nwe are yet here, it is well; but if we are not, then abide us no long\r\nwhile, but break thy fast on the victual thou wilt find upon the board,\r\nand so depart and go thy ways home.  And yet thou mayst look to it to see\r\nus again before thou diest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she held out her hand to him, and he took it and kissed it; and\r\nshe went to her chamber-aloft at the lower end of the hall.  And when she\r\nwas gone, once more he had a deeming of her that she was of the kindred\r\nof the Gods.  At her departure him-seemed that the hall grew dull and\r\nsmall and smoky, and the night seemed long to him and doubtful the coming\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE FRIEND ON THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSO now went all men to bed; and Face-to-god\xe2\x80\x99s shut-bed was over against\r\nthe outer door and toward the lower end of the hall, and on the panel\r\nabout it hung the weapons and shields of men.  Fair was that chamber and\r\nroomy, and the man was weary despite his eagerness, so that he went to\r\nsleep as soon as his head touched the pillow; but within a while (he\r\ndeemed about two hours after midnight) he was awaked by the clattering of\r\nthe weapons against the panel, and the sound of men\xe2\x80\x99s hands taking them\r\ndown; and when he was fully awake, he heard withal men going up and down\r\nthe house as if on errands: but he called to mind what the Friend had\r\nsaid to him, and he did not so much as turn himself toward the hall; for\r\nhe said: \xe2\x80\x98Belike these men are outlaws and Wolves of the Holy Places, yet\r\nby seeming they are good fellows and nought churlish, nor have I to do\r\nwith taking up the feud against them.  I will abide the morning.  Yet\r\nmeseemeth that she drew me hither: for what cause?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he fell asleep again, and dreamed no more.  But when he awoke\r\nthe sun was shining broad upon the hall-floor, and he sat up and\r\nlistened, but could hear no sound save the moaning of the wind in the\r\npine-boughs and the chatter of the starlings about the gables of the\r\nhouse; and the place seemed so exceeding lonely to him that he was in a\r\nmanner feared by that loneliness.\r\n\r\nThen he arose and clad himself, and went forth into the hall and gazed\r\nabout him, and at first he deemed indeed that there was no one therein.\r\nBut at last he looked and beheld the upper gable and there underneath a\r\nmost goodly hanging was the glorious shape of a woman sitting on a bench\r\ncovered over with a cloth of gold and silver; and he looked and looked to\r\nsee if the woman might stir, and if she were alive, and she turned her\r\nhead toward him, and lo it was the Friend; and his heart rose to his\r\nmouth for wonder and fear and desire.  For now he doubted whether the\r\nother folk were aught save shows and shadows, and she the Goddess who had\r\nfashioned them out of nothing for his bewilderment, presently to return\r\nto nothing.\r\n\r\nYet whatever he might fear or doubt, he went up the hall towards her till\r\nhe was quite nigh to her, and there he stood silent, wondering at her\r\nbeauty and desiring her kindness.\r\n\r\nGrey-eyed she was like her brother; but her hair the colour of red wheat:\r\nher lips full and red, her chin round, her nose fine and straight.  Her\r\nhands and all her body fashioned exceeding sweetly and delicately; yet\r\nnot as if she were an image of which the like might be found if the\r\ncraftsman were but deft enough to make a perfect thing, but in such a way\r\nthat there was none like to her for those that had eyes to behold her as\r\nshe was; and none could ever be made like to her, even by such a\r\nmaster-craftsman as could fashion a body without a blemish.\r\n\r\nShe was clad in a white smock, whose hems were broidered with gold wire\r\nand precious gems of the Mountains, and over that a gown woven of gold\r\nand silver: scarce hath the world such another.  On her head was a fillet\r\nof gold and gems, and there were wondrous gold rings on her arms: her\r\nfeet lay bare on the dark grey wolf-skin that was stretched before her.\r\n\r\nShe smiled kindly upon his solemn and troubled face, and her voice\r\nsounded strangely familiar to him coming from all that loveliness, as she\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Hail, Face-of-god! here am I left alone, although I deemed last\r\nnight that I should be gone with the others.  Therefore am I fain to show\r\nmyself to thee in fairer array than yesternight; for though we dwell in\r\nthe wild-wood, from the solace of folk, yet are we not of thralls\xe2\x80\x99 blood.\r\nBut come now, I bid thee break thy fast and talk with me a little while;\r\nand then shalt thou depart in peace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSpake Face-of-god, and his voice trembled as he spake: \xe2\x80\x98What art thou?\r\nLast night I deemed at whiles once and again that thou wert of the Gods;\r\nand now that I behold thee thus, and it is broad daylight, and of those\r\nothers is no more to be seen than if they had never lived, I cannot but\r\ndeem that it is even so, and that thou comest from the City that shall\r\nnever perish.  Now if thou be a goddess, I have nought to pray thee, save\r\nto slay me speedily if thou hast a mind for my death.  But if thou art a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe broke in: \xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, stay thy prayer and hold thy peace for this\r\ntime, lest thou repent when repentance availeth not.  And this I say\r\nbecause I am none of the Gods nor akin to them, save far off through the\r\ngenerations, as art thou also, and all men of goodly kindred.  Now I bid\r\nthee eat thy meat, since \xe2\x80\x99tis ill talking betwixt a full man and a\r\nfasting; and I have dight it myself with mine own hands; for Bow-may and\r\nthe Wood-mother went away with the rest three hours before dawn.  Come\r\nsit and eat as thou hast a hardy heart; as forsooth thou shouldest do if\r\nI were a very goddess.  Take heed, friend, lest I take thee for some\r\ndamsel of the lower Dale arrayed in Earl\xe2\x80\x99s garments.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laughed therewith, and leaned toward him and put forth her hand to\r\nhim, and he took it and caressed it; and the exceeding beauty of her body\r\nand of the raiment which was as it were a part of her and her loveliness,\r\nmade her laughter and her friendly words strange to him, as if one did\r\nnot belong to the other; as in a dream it might be.  Nevertheless he did\r\nas she bade him, and sat at the board and ate, while she leaned forward\r\non the arm of her chair and spake to him in friendly wise.  And he\r\nwondered as she spake that she knew so much of him and his: and he kept\r\nsaying to himself: \xe2\x80\x98She drew me hither; wherefore did she so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she said: \xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, how fareth thy father the Alderman? is he as\r\ngood a wright as ever?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe told her: Yea, that ever was his hammer on the iron, the copper, and\r\nthe gold, and that no wright in the Dale was as deft as he.\r\n\r\nSaid she: \xe2\x80\x98Would he not have had thee seek to the Cities, to see the ways\r\nof the outer world?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou wert wise to naysay that offer; thou shalt have enough to\r\ndo in the Dale and round about it in twelve months\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Art thou foresighted?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Folk have called me so,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but I wot not.  But thy brother\r\nHall-face, how fareth he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well;\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98to my deeming he is the Sword of our House, and the\r\nWarrior of the Dale, if the days were ready for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Stone-face, that stark ancient,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98doth he still love the\r\nFolk of the Dale, and hate all other folks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I know not that, but I know that he loveth as, and above\r\nall me and my father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain she spake: \xe2\x80\x98How fareth the Bride, the fair maid to whom thou art\r\naffianced?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she spake, it was to him as if his heart was stricken cold; but he put\r\na force upon himself, and neither reddened nor whitened, nor changed\r\ncountenance in any way; so he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was well the eve of yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99  Then he remembered what she was,\r\nand her beauty and valour, and he constrained himself to say: \xe2\x80\x98Each day\r\nshe groweth fairer; there is no man\xe2\x80\x99s son and no daughter of woman that\r\ndoes not love her; yea, the very beasts of field and fold love her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Friend looked at him steadily and spake no word, but a red flush\r\nmounted to her cheeks and brow and changed her face; and he marvelled\r\nthereat; for still he misdoubted that she was a Goddess.  But it passed\r\naway in a moment, and she smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guest, thou seemest to wonder that I know concerning thee and the Dale\r\nand thy kindred.  But now shalt thou wot that I have been in the Dale\r\nonce and again, and my brother oftener still; and that I have seen thee\r\nbefore yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is marvellous,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth he, \xe2\x80\x98for sure am I that I have not seen\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet thou hast seen me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98yet not altogether as I am now;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\ntherewith she smiled on him friendly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is this?\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98art thou a skin-changer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, in a fashion,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98Hearken! dost thou perchance remember a\r\nday of last summer when there was a market holden in Burgstead; and there\r\nstood in the way over against the House of the Face a tall old carle who\r\nwas trucking deer-skins for diverse gear; and with him was a queen, tall\r\nand dark-skinned, somewhat well-liking, her hair bound up in a white coif\r\nso that none of it could be seen; by the token that she had a large stone\r\nof mountain blue set in silver stuck in the said coif?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she set her hand to her bosom and drew something from it,\r\nand held forth her hand to Gold-mane, and lo amidst the palm the great\r\nblue stone set in silver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wondrous as a dream is this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98for these twain I\r\nremember well, and what followed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98I will tell thee that.  There came a man of the Shepherd-Folk,\r\ndrunk or foolish, or both, who began to chaffer with the big carle; but\r\never on the queen were his eyes set, and presently he put forth his hand\r\nto her to clip her, whereon the big carle hove up his fist and smote him,\r\nso that he fell to earth noseling.  Then ran the folk together to hale\r\noff the stranger and help the shepherd, and it was like that the stranger\r\nshould be mishandled.  Then there thrust through the press a young man\r\nwith yellow hair and grey eyes, who cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cFellows, let be!  The\r\nstranger had the right of it; this is no matter to make a quarrel or a\r\ncourt case of.  Let the market go on!  This man and maid are true folk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo when the folk heard the young man and his bidding, they forebore and\r\nlet the carle and the queen be, and the shepherd went his ways little\r\nhurt.  Now then, who was this young man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nQuoth Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98It was even I, and meseemeth it was no great deed to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and the big carle was my brother, and the tall queen,\r\nit was myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How then,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98for she was as dark-skinned as a dwarf, and thou so\r\nbright and fair?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Well, if the woods are good for nothing else, yet are they\r\ngood for the growing of herbs, and I know the craft of simpling; and with\r\none of these herbs had I stained my skin and my brother\xe2\x80\x99s also.  And it\r\nshowed the darker beneath the white coif.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but why must ye needs fare in feigned shapes?  Ye would\r\nhave been welcome guests in the Dale howsoever ye had come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I may not tell thee hereof as now,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\nSaid Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98Yet thou mayst belike tell me wherefore was that thy\r\nbrother desired to slay me yesterday, if he knew me, who I was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98thou art not slain, so little story need be made\r\nof that: for the rest, belike he knew thee not at that moment.  So it\r\nfalls with us, that we look to see foes rather than friends in the\r\nwild-woods.  Many uncouth things are therein.  Moreover, I must tell thee\r\nof my brother that whiles he is as the stalled bull late let loose, and\r\nnothing is good to him save battle and onset; and then is he blind and\r\nknows not friend from foe.\xe2\x80\x99  Said Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Thou hast asked of me and\r\nmine; wilt thou not tell me of thee and thine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98not as now; thou must betake thee to the way.  Whither\r\nwert thou wending when thou happenedst upon us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98I know not; I was seeking something, but I knew not\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x94meseemeth that now I have found it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Art thou for the great mountains seeking gems?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98Yet go not\r\nthither to-day: for who knoweth what thou shalt meet there that shall be\r\nthy foe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, nay; I have nought to do but to abide here as long as I\r\nmay, looking upon thee and hearkening to thy voice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer eyes were upon his, but yet she did not seem to see him, and for a\r\nwhile she answered not; and still he wondered that mere words should come\r\nfrom so fair a thing; for whether she moved foot, or hand, or knee, or\r\nturned this way or that, each time she stirred it was a caress to his\r\nvery heart.\r\n\r\nHe spake again: \xe2\x80\x98May I not abide here a while?  What scathe may be in\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not so,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98thou must depart, and that straightway: lo,\r\nthere lieth thy spear which the Wood-mother hath brought in from the\r\nwaste.  Take thy gear to thee and wend thy ways.  Have patience!  I will\r\nlead thee to the place where we first met and there give thee farewell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she arose and he also perforce, and when they came to the\r\ndoorway she stepped across the threshold and then turned back and gave\r\nhim her hand and so led him forth, the sun flashing back from her golden\r\nraiment.  Together they went over the short grey grass of that hillside\r\ntill they came to the place where he had arisen from that wrestle with\r\nher brother.  There she stayed him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the place; here must we part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut his heart failed him and he faltered in his speech as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When shall I see thee again?  Wilt thou slay me if I seek to thee hither\r\nonce more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hearken,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98autumn is now a-dying into winter: let winter and\r\nits snows go past: nor seek to me hither; for me thou should\xe2\x80\x99st not find,\r\nbut thy death thou mightest well fall in with; and I would not that thou\r\nshouldest die.  When winter is gone, and spring is on the land, if thou\r\nhast not forgotten us thou shalt meet us again.  Yet shalt thou go\r\nfurther than this Woodland Hall.  In Shadowy Vale shalt thou seek to me\r\nthen, and there will I talk with thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98is Shadowy Vale? for thereof have I never heard\r\ntell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98The token when it cometh to thee shall show thee thereof and\r\nthe way thither.  Art thou a babbler, Gold-mane?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98I have won no prize for babbling hitherto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98If thou listest to babble concerning what hath befallen thee\r\non the Mountain, so do, and repent it once only, that is, thy life long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should I say any word thereof?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.  \xe2\x80\x98Dost thou not know the\r\nsweetness of such a tale untold?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spake as one who is somewhat wrathful, and she answered humbly and\r\nkindly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well is that.  Bide thou the token that shall lead thee to Shadowy Vale.\r\nFarewell now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe drew her hand from his, and turned and went her ways swiftly to the\r\nhouse: he could not choose but gaze on her as she went glittering-bright\r\nand fair in that grey place of the mountains, till the dark doorway\r\nswallowed up her beauty.  Then he turned away and took the path through\r\nthe pine-woods, muttering to himself as he went:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What thing have I done now that hitherto I had not done?  What manner of\r\nman am I to-day other than the man I was yesterday?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.  FACE-OF-GOD COMETH HOME AGAIN TO BURGSTEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACE-OF-GOD went back through the wood by the way he had come, paying\r\nlittle heed to the things about him.  For whatever he thought of strayed\r\nnot one whit from the image of the Fair Woman of the Mountain-side.\r\n\r\nHe went through the wood swiftlier than yesterday, and made no stay for\r\nnoon or aught else, nor did he linger on the road when he was come into\r\nthe Dale, either to speak to any or to note what they did.  So he came to\r\nthe House of the Face about dusk, and found no man within the hall either\r\ncarle or queen.  So he cried out on the folk, and there came in a damsel\r\nof the house, whom he greeted kindly and she him again.  He bade her\r\nbring the washing-water, and she did so and washed his feet and his\r\nhands.  She was a fair maid enough, as were most in the Dale, but he\r\nheeded her little; and when she was done he kissed not her cheek for her\r\npains, as his wont was, but let her go her ways unthanked.  But he went\r\nto his shut-bed and opened his chest, and drew fair raiment from it, and\r\ndid off his wood-gear, and did on him a goodly scarlet kirtle fairly\r\nbroidered, and a collar with gems of price therein, and other braveries.\r\nAnd when he was so attired he came out into the hall, and there was old\r\nStone-face standing by the hearth, which was blazing brightly with fresh\r\nbrands, so that things were clear to see.\r\n\r\nStone-face noted Gold-mane\xe2\x80\x99s gay raiment, for he was not wont to wear\r\nsuch attire, save on the feasts and high days when he behoved to.  So the\r\nold man smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Welcome back from the Wood!  But what is it?  Hast thou been wedded\r\nthere, or who hath made thee Earl and King?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Foster-father, sooth it is that I have been to the\r\nwood, but there have I seen nought of manfolk worse than myself.  Now as\r\nto my raiment, needs must I keep it from the moth.  And I am weary\r\nwithal, and this kirtle is light and easy to me.  Moreover, I look to see\r\nthe Bride here again, and I would pleasure her with the sight of gay\r\nraiment upon me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98hast thou not seen some woman in the wood\r\narrayed like the image of a God? and hath she not bidden thee thus to\r\nworship her to-night?  For I know that such wights be in the wood, and\r\nthat such is their wont.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98I worship nought save the Gods and the Fathers.  Nor saw\r\nI in the wood any such as thou sayest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith Stone-face shook his head; but after a while he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Art thou for the wood to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane angrily, knitting his brows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The morrow of to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98is the day when we look to\r\nsee the Westland merchants: after all, wilt thou not go hence with them\r\nwhen they wend their ways back before the first snows fall?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I have no mind to it, fosterer; cease egging me on\r\nhereto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Stone-face shook his head again, and looked on him long, and\r\nmuttered: \xe2\x80\x98To the wood wilt thou go to-morrow or next day; or some day\r\nwhen doomed is thine undoing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith entered the service and torches, and presently after came the\r\nAlderman with Hall-face; and Iron-face greeted his son and said to him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou hast not hit the time to do on thy gay raiment, for the Bride will\r\nnot be here to-night; she bideth still at the Feast at the Apple-tree\r\nHouse: or wilt thou be there, son?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98I am over-weary.  And as for my raiment, it is\r\nwell; it is for thine honour and the honour of the name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo to table they went, and Iron-face asked his son of his ways again, and\r\nwhether he was quite fixed in his mind not to go down to the Plain and\r\nthe Cities: \xe2\x80\x98For,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98the morrow of to-morrow shall the merchants\r\nbe here, and this were great news for them if the son of the Alderman\r\nshould be their faring-fellow back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god answered without any haste or heat: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, father, it may\r\nnot be: fear not, thou shalt see that I have a good will to work and live\r\nin the Dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd in good sooth, though he was a young man and loved mirth and the ways\r\nof his own will, he was a stalwarth workman, and few could mow a match\r\nwith him in the hay-month and win it; or fell trees as certainly and\r\nswiftly, or drive as straight and clean a furrow through the stiff land\r\nof the lower Dale; and in other matters also was he deft and sturdy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.  THOSE BRETHREN FARE TO THE YEWWOOD WITH THE BRIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEXT morning Face-of-god dight himself for work, and took his axe; for\r\nhis brother Hall-face had bidden him go down with him to the Yew-wood and\r\ncut timber there, since he of all men knew where to go straight to the\r\nsticks that would quarter best for bow-staves; whereas the Alderman had\r\nthe right of hewing in that wood.  So they went forth, those brethren,\r\nfrom the House of the Face, but when they were gotten to the gate, who\r\nshould be there but the Bride awaiting them, and she with an ass duly\r\nsaddled for bearing the yew-sticks.  Because Hall-face had told her that\r\nhe and belike Gold-mane were going to hew in the wood, and she thought it\r\ngood to be of the company, as oft had befallen erst.  When they met she\r\ngreeted Face-of-god and kissed him as her wont was; and he looked upon\r\nher and saw how fair she was, and how kind and friendly were her eyes\r\nthat beheld him, and how her whole face was eager for him as their lips\r\nparted.  Then his heart failed him, when he knew that he no longer\r\ndesired her as she did him, and he said within himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would that she had been of our nighest kindred!  Would that I had had a\r\nsister and that this were she!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the three went along the highway down the Dale, and Hall-face and the\r\nBride talked merrily together and laughed, for she was happy, since she\r\nknew that Gold-mane had been to the wood and was back safe and much as he\r\nhad been before.  So indeed it seemed of him; for though at first he was\r\nmoody and of few words, yet presently he cursed himself for a mar-sport,\r\nand so fell into the talk, and enforced himself to be merry; and soon he\r\nwas so indeed; for he thought: \xe2\x80\x98She drew me thither: she hath a deed for\r\nme to do.  I shall do the deed and have my reward.  Soon will the\r\nspring-tide be here, and I shall be a young man yet when it comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo came they to the place where he had met the three maidens yesterday;\r\nthere they also turned from the highway; and as they went down the bent,\r\nGold-mane could not but turn his eyes on the beauty of the Bride and the\r\nlovely ways of her body: but presently he remembered all that had betid,\r\nand turned away again as one who is noting what it behoves him not to\r\nnote.  And he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x98Where art thou, Gold-mane?  Whose art\r\nthou?  Yea, even if that had been but a dream that I have dreamed, yet\r\nwould that this fair woman were my sister!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo came they to the Yew-wood, and the brethren fell to work, and the\r\nBride with them, for she was deft with the axe and strong withal.  But at\r\nmidday they rested on the green slope without the Yew-wood; and they ate\r\nbread and flesh and onions and apples, and drank red wine of the Dale.\r\nAnd while they were resting after their meat, the Bride sang to them, and\r\nher song was a lay of time past; and here ye have somewhat of it:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x99Tis over the hill and over the dale\r\n      Men ride from the city fast and far,\r\n   If they may have a soothfast tale,\r\n      True tidings of the host of war.\r\n\r\n   And first they hap on men-at-arms,\r\n      All clad in steel from head to foot:\r\n   Now tell true tale of the new-come harms,\r\n      And the gathered hosts of the mountain-root.\r\n\r\n   Fair sirs, from murder-carles we flee,\r\n      Whose fashion is as the mountain-trolls\xe2\x80\x99;\r\n   No man can tell how many they be,\r\n      And the voice of their host as the thunder rolls.\r\n\r\n   They were weary men at the ending of day,\r\n      But they spurred nor stayed for longer word.\r\n   Now ye, O merchants, whither away?\r\n      What do ye there with the helm and the sword?\r\n\r\n   O we must fight for life and gear,\r\n      For our beasts are spent and our wains are stayed,\r\n   And the host of the Mountain-men draws near,\r\n      That maketh all the world afraid.\r\n\r\n   They left the chapmen on the hill,\r\n      And through the eve and through the night\r\n   They rode to have true tidings still,\r\n      And were there on the way when the dawn was bright.\r\n\r\n   O damsels fair, what do ye then\r\n      To loiter thus upon the way,\r\n   And have no fear of the Mountain-men,\r\n      The host of the carles that strip and slay?\r\n\r\n   O riders weary with the road,\r\n      Come eat and drink on the grass hereby!\r\n   And lay you down in a fair abode\r\n      Till the midday sun is broad and high;\r\n\r\n   Then unto you shall we come aback,\r\n      And lead you forth to the Mountain-men,\r\n   To note their plenty and their lack,\r\n      And have true tidings there and then.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x99Tis over the hill and over the dale\r\n      They ride from the mountain fast and far;\r\n   And now have they learned a soothfast tale,\r\n      True tidings of the host of war.\r\n\r\n   It was summer-tide and the Month of Hay,\r\n      And men and maids must fare afield;\r\n   But we saw the place were the bow-staves lay,\r\n      And the hall was hung with spear and shield.\r\n\r\n   When the moon was high we drank in the hall,\r\n      And they drank to the guests and were kind and blithe,\r\n   And they said: Come back when the chestnuts fall,\r\n      And the wine-carts wend across the hythe.\r\n\r\n   Come oft and o\xe2\x80\x99er again, they said;\r\n      Wander your ways; but we abide\r\n   For all the world in the little stead;\r\n      For wise are we, though the world be wide.\r\n\r\n   Yea, come in arms if ye will, they said;\r\n      And despite your host shall we abide\r\n   For life or death in the little stead;\r\n      For wise are we, though the world be wide.\r\n\r\nSo she made an end and looked at the fairness of the dale spreading wide\r\nbefore her, and a robin came nigh from out of a thorn-bush and sung his\r\nsong also, the sweet herald of coming winter; and the lapwings wheeled\r\nabout, black and white, above the meadow by the river, sending forth\r\ntheir wheedling pipe as they hung above the soft turf.\r\n\r\nShe felt the brothers near her, and knew their friendliness from of old,\r\nand she was happy; nor had she looked closer at Gold-mane would she have\r\nnoted any change in him belike; for the meat and the good wine, and the\r\nfair sunny time, and the Bride\xe2\x80\x99s sweet voice, and the ancient song\r\nsoftened his heart while it fed the desire therein.\r\n\r\nSo in a while they arose from their rest and did what was left them of\r\ntheir work, and so went back to Burgstead through the fair afternoon; by\r\nseeming all three in all content.  But yet Gold-mane, as from time to\r\ntime he looked upon the Bride, kept saying to himself: \xe2\x80\x98O if she had been\r\nbut my sister! sweet had the kinship been!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.  NEW TIDINGS IN THE DALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was three days thereafter that Gold-mane, leading an ass, went along\r\nthe highway to fetch home certain fleeces which were needed for the house\r\nfrom a stead a little west of Wildlake; but he had gone scant half a mile\r\nere he fell in with a throng of folk going to Burgstead.  They were of\r\nthe Shepherds; they had weapons with them, and some were clad in coats of\r\nfence.  They went along making a great noise, for they were all talking\r\neach to each at the same time, and seemed very hot and eager about some\r\nmatter.  When they saw Gold-mane anigh, they stopped, and the throng\r\nopened as if to let him into their midmost; so he mingled with them, and\r\nthey stood in a ring about him and an old man more ill-favoured than it\r\nwas the wont of the Dalesmen to be.\r\n\r\nFor he was long, stooping, gaunt and spindle-shanked, his hands big and\r\ncrippled with gout: his cheeks were red after an old man\xe2\x80\x99s fashion,\r\ncovered with a crimson network like a pippin; his lips thin and not well\r\nhiding his few teeth; his nose long like a snipe\xe2\x80\x99s neb.  In short, a\r\nshame and a laughing-stock to the Folk, and a man whom the kindreds had\r\nin small esteem, and that for good reasons.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god knew him at once for a notable close-fist and starve-all fool\r\nof the Shepherds; and his name was now become Penny-thumb the Lean,\r\nwhatever it might once have been.\r\n\r\nSo Face-of-god greeted all men, and they him again; and he said: \xe2\x80\x98What\r\naileth you, neighbours?  Your weapons, are bare, but I see not that they\r\nbe bloody.  What is it, goodman Penny-thumb?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPenny-thumb did but groan for all answer; but a stout carle who stood by\r\nwith a broad grin on his face answered and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Face-of-god, evil tidings be abroad; the strong-thieves of the wood are\r\nastir; and some deem that the wood-wights be helping them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, and what is the deed they have done?\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane.\r\n\r\nSaid the carle: \xe2\x80\x98Thou knowest Penny-thumb\xe2\x80\x99s abode?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; \xe2\x80\x98fair are the water-meadows about it;\r\ngreat gain of cheese can be gotten thence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hast thou been within the house?\xe2\x80\x99 said the carle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane.\r\n\r\nThen spake Penny-thumb: \xe2\x80\x98Within is scant gear: we gather for others to\r\nscatter; we make meat for others\xe2\x80\x99 mouths.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe carle laughed: \xe2\x80\x98Sooth is that,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98that there is little gear\r\ntherein now; for the strong-thieves have voided both hall and bower and\r\nbyre.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when was that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The night before last night,\xe2\x80\x99 said the carle, \xe2\x80\x98the door was smitten on,\r\nand when none answered it was broken down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Penny-thumb, \xe2\x80\x98a host entered, and they in arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No host was within,\xe2\x80\x99 said the carle, \xe2\x80\x98nought but Penny-thumb and his\r\nsister and his sister\xe2\x80\x99s son, and three carles that work for him; and one\r\nof them, Rusty to wit, was the worst man of the hill-country.  These then\r\nthe host whereof the goodman telleth bound, but without doing them any\r\nscathe; and they ransacked the house, and took away much gear; yet left\r\nsome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou liest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Penny-thumb; \xe2\x80\x98they took little and left none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereat all men laughed, for this seemed to them good game, and another\r\nman said: \xe2\x80\x98Well, neighbour Penny-thumb, if it was so little, thou hast\r\ndone unneighbourly in giving us such a heap of trouble about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd they laughed again, but the first carle said: \xe2\x80\x98True it is, goodman,\r\nthat thou wert exceeding eager to raise the hue and cry after that little\r\nwhen we happed upon thee and thy housemates bound in your chairs\r\nyesterday morning.  Well, Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s son, short is the tale to tell: we\r\ncould not fail to follow the gear, and the slot led us into the wood, and\r\nill is the going there for us shepherds, who are used to the bare downs,\r\nsave Rusty, who was a good woodsman and lifted the slot for us; so he\r\noutwent us all, and ran out of sight of us, so presently we came upon him\r\ndead-slain, with the manslayer\xe2\x80\x99s spear in his breast.  What then could we\r\ndo but turn back again, for now was the wood blind now Rusty was dead,\r\nand we knew not whither to follow the fray; and the man himself was but\r\nlittle loss: so back we turned, and told goodman Penny-thumb of all this,\r\nfor we had left him alone in his hall lamenting his gear; so we bided\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x99s morn, and have come out now, with our neighbour and the spear,\r\nand the dead corpse of Rusty.  Stand aside, neighbours, and let the\r\nAlderman\xe2\x80\x99s son see it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey did so, and there was the corpse of a thin-faced tall wiry man,\r\nsomewhat foxy of aspect, lying on a hand-bier covered with black cloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, Face-of-god,\xe2\x80\x99 said the carle, \xe2\x80\x98he is not good to see now he is\r\ndead, yet alive was he worser: but, look you, though the man was no good\r\nman, yet was he of our people, and the feud is with us; so we would see\r\nthe Alderman, and do him to wit of the tidings, that he may call the\r\nneighbours together to seek a blood-wite for Rusty and atonement for the\r\nransacking.  Or what sayest thou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have ye the spear that ye found in Rusty?\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Gold-mane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea verily,\xe2\x80\x99 said the carle.  \xe2\x80\x98Hither with it, neighbours; give it to\r\nthe Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the spear came into his hand, and he looked at it and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is no spear of the smiths\xe2\x80\x99 work of the Dale, as my father will tell\r\nyou.  We take but little keep of the forging of spearheads here, so that\r\nthey be well-tempered and made so as to ride well on the shaft; but this\r\nhead, daintily is it wrought, the blood-trench as clean and trim as\r\nthough it were an Earl\xe2\x80\x99s sword.  See you withal this inlaying of runes on\r\nthe steel?  It is done with no tin or copper, but with very silver; and\r\nthese bands about the shaft be of silver also.  It is a fair weapon, and\r\nthe owner hath a loss of it greater than his gain in the slaying of\r\nRusty; and he will have left it in the wound so that he might be known\r\nhereafter, and that he might be said not to have murdered Rusty but to\r\nhave slain him.  Or how think ye?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey all said that this seemed like to be; but that if the man who had\r\nslain Rusty were one of the ransackers they might have a blood-wite of\r\nhim, if they could find him.  Gold-mane said that so it was, and\r\ntherewithal he gave the shepherds good-speed and went on his way.\r\n\r\nBut they came to Burgstead and found the Alderman, and in due time was a\r\nCourt held, and a finding uttered, and outlawry given forth for the\r\nmanslaying and the ransacking against certain men unknown.  As for the\r\nspear, it was laid up in the House of the Face.\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god pondered these matters in his mind, for such ransackings\r\nthere had been none of in late years; and he said to himself that his\r\nfriends of the Mountain must have other folk, of which the Dalesmen knew\r\nnought, whose gear they could lift, or how could they live in that place.\r\nAnd he marvelled that they should risk drawing the Dalesmen\xe2\x80\x99s wrath upon\r\nthem; whereas they of the Dale were strong men not easily daunted, albeit\r\npeaceable enough if not stirred to wrath.  For in good sooth he had no\r\ndoubt concerning that spear, whose it was and whence it came: for that\r\nvery weapon had been leaning against the panel of his shut-bed the night\r\nhe slept on the Mountain, and all the other spears that he saw there were\r\nmore or less of the same fashion, and adorned with silver.\r\n\r\nAlbeit all that he knew, and all that he thought of, he kept in his own\r\nheart and said nothing of it.\r\n\r\nSo wore the autumn into early winter; and the Westland merchants came in\r\ndue time, and departed without Face-of-god, though his father made him\r\nthat offer one last time.  He went to and fro about his work in the Dale,\r\nand seemed to most men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes nought changed from what he had been.  But\r\nthe Bride noted that he saw her less often than his wont was, and abode\r\nwith her a lesser space when he met her; and she could not think what\r\nthis might mean; nor had she heart to ask him thereof, though she was\r\nsorry and grieved, but rather withdrew her company from him somewhat; and\r\nwhen she perceived that he noted it not, and made no question of it, then\r\nwas she the sorrier.\r\n\r\nBut the first winter-snow came on with a great storm of wind from the\r\nnorth-east, so that no man stirred abroad who was not compelled thereto,\r\nand those who went abroad risked life and limb thereby.  Next morning all\r\nwas calm again, and the snow was deep, but it did not endure long, for\r\nthe wind shifted to the southwest and the thaw came, and three days\r\nafter, when folk could fare easily again up and down the Dale, came\r\ntidings to Burgstead and the Alderman from the Lower Dale, how a house\r\ncalled Greentofts had been ransacked there, and none knew by whom.  Now\r\nthe goodman of Greentofts was little loved of the neighbours: he was\r\ngrasping and overbearing, and had often cowed others out of their due: he\r\nwas very cross-grained, both at home and abroad: his wife had fled from\r\nhis hand, neither did his sons find it good to abide with him:\r\ntherewithal he was wealthy of goods, a strong man and a deft man-at-arms.\r\nWhen his sons and his wife departed from him, and none other of the\r\nDalesmen cared to abide with him, he went down into the Plain, and got\r\nthence men to be with him for hire, men who were not well seen to in\r\ntheir own land.  These to the number of twelve abode with him, and did\r\nhis bidding whenso it pleased them.  Two more had he had who had been\r\nslain by good men of the Dale for their masterful ways; and no blood-wite\r\nhad been paid for them, because of their ill-doings, though they had not\r\nbeen made outlaws.  This man of Greentofts was called Harts-bane after\r\nhis father, who was a great hunter.\r\n\r\nNow the full tidings of the ransacking were these: The storm began two\r\nhours before sunset, and an hour thereafter, when it was quite dark, for\r\nwithout none could see because the wind was at its height and the drift\r\nof the snow was hard and full, the hall-door flew open; and at first men\r\nthought it had been the wind, until they saw in the dimness (for all\r\nlights but the fire on the hearth had been quenched) certain things\r\ntumbling in which at first they deemed were wolves; but when they took\r\nswords and staves against them, lo they were met by swords and axes, and\r\nthey saw that the seeming wolves were men with wolf-skins drawn over\r\nthem.  So the new-comers cowed them that they threw down their weapons,\r\nand were bound in their places; but when they were bound, and had had\r\ntime to note who the ransackers were, they saw that there were but six of\r\nthem all told, who had cowed and bound Harts-bane and his twelve\r\nmasterful men; and this they deemed a great shaming to them, as might\r\nwell be.\r\n\r\nSo then the stead was ransacked, and those wolves took away what they\r\nwould, and went their ways through the fierce storm, and none could tell\r\nwhether they had lived or died in it; but at least neither the men nor\r\ntheir prey were seen again; nor did they leave any slot, for next morning\r\nthe snow lay deep over everything.\r\n\r\nNo doubt had Gold-mane but that these ransackers were his friends of the\r\nMountain; but he held his peace, abiding till the winter should be over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.  MEN MAKE OATH AT BURGSTEAD ON THE HOLY BOAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WEEK after the ransacking at Greentofts the snow and the winter came on\r\nin earnest, and all the Dale lay in snow, and men went on skids when they\r\nfared up and down the Dale or on the Mountain.\r\n\r\nAll was now tidingless till Yule over, and in Burgstead was there\r\nfeasting and joyance enough; and especially at the House of the Face was\r\nhigh-tide holden, and the Alderman and his sons and Stone-face and all\r\nthe kindred and all their men sat in glorious attire within the hall; and\r\nmany others were there of the best of the kindreds of Burgstead who had\r\nbeen bidden.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god sat between his father and Stone-face; and he looked up and\r\ndown the tables and the hall and saw not the Bride, and his heart misgave\r\nhim because she was not there, and he wondered what had befallen and if\r\nshe were sick of sorrow.\r\n\r\nBut Iron-face beheld him how he gazed about, and he laughed; for he was\r\nexceeding merry that night and fared as a young man.  Then he said to his\r\nson: \xe2\x80\x98Whom seekest thou, son? is there someone lacking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god reddened as one who lies unused to it, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, kinsman, so it is that I was seeking the Bride my kinswoman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face, \xe2\x80\x98call her not kinswoman: therein is ill-luck, lest\r\nit seem that thou art to wed one too nigh thine own blood.  Call her the\r\nBride only: to thee and to me the name is good.  Well, son, desirest thou\r\nsorely to see her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, yea, surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; but his eyes went all about the\r\nhall still, as though his mind strayed from the place and that home of\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nSaid Iron-face: \xe2\x80\x98Have patience, son, thou shalt see her anon, and that in\r\nsuch guise as shall please thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewithal came the maidens with the ewers of wine, and they filled all\r\nhorns and beakers, and then stood by the endlong tables on either side\r\nlaughing and talking with the carles and the older women; and the hall\r\nwas a fair sight to see, for the many candles burned bright and the fire\r\non the hearth flared up, and those maids were clad in fair raiment, and\r\nthere was none of them but was comely, and some were fair, and some very\r\nfair: the walls also were hung with goodly pictured cloths, and the image\r\nof the God of the Face looked down smiling terribly from the gable-end\r\nabove the high-seat.\r\n\r\nThus as they sat they heard the sound of a horn winded close outside the\r\nhall door, and the door was smitten on.  Then rose Iron-face smiling\r\nmerrily, and cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enter ye, whether ye be friends or foes: for if ye be foemen, yet shall\r\nye keep the holy peace of Yule, unless ye be the foes of all kindreds and\r\nnations, and then shall we slay you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereat some who knew what was toward laughed; but Gold-mane, who had\r\nbeen away from Burgstead some days past, marvelled and knit his brows,\r\nand let his right hand fall on his sword-hilt.  For this folk, who were\r\nof merry ways, were wont to deal diversely with the Yule-tide customs in\r\nthe manner of shows; and he knew not that this was one of them.\r\n\r\nNow was the Outer door thrown open, and there entered seven men, whereof\r\ntwo were all-armed in bright war-gear, and two bore slug-horns, and two\r\nbore up somewhat on a dish covered over with a piece of rich cloth, and\r\nthe seventh stood before them all wrapped up in a dark fur mantle.\r\n\r\nThus they stood a moment; and when he saw their number, back to\r\nGold-mane\xe2\x80\x99s heart came the thought of those folk on the Mountain: for\r\nindeed he was somewhat out of himself for doubt and longing, else would\r\nhe have deemed that all this was but a Yule-tide play.\r\n\r\nNow the men with the slug-horns set them to their mouths and blew a long\r\nblast; while the first of the new-comers set hand to the clasps of the\r\nfur cloak and let it fall to the ground, and lo! a woman exceeding\r\nbeauteous, clad in glistering raiment of gold and fine web; her hair\r\nwreathed with bay, and in her hand a naked sword with goodly-wrought\r\ngolden hilt and polished blue-gleaming blade.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god started up in his sear, and stared like a man new-wakened\r\nfrom a strange dream: because for one moment he deemed verily that it was\r\nthe Woman of the Mountain arrayed as he had last seen her, and he cried\r\naloud \xe2\x80\x98The Friend, the Friend!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis father brake out into loud laughter thereat, and clapped his son on\r\nthe shoulder and said: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, yea, lad, thou mayst well say the Friend;\r\nfor this is thine old playmate whom thou hast been looking round the hall\r\nfor, arrayed this eve in such fashion as is meet for her goodliness and\r\nher worthiness.  Yea, this is the Friend indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen waxed Face-of-god as red as blood for shame, and he sat him down in\r\nhis place again: for now he wotted what was toward, and saw that this\r\nfair woman was the Bride.\r\n\r\nBut Stone-face from the other side looked keenly on him.\r\n\r\nThen blew the horns again, and the Bride stepped daintily up the hall,\r\nand the sweet odour of her raiment went from her about the fire-warmed\r\ndwelling, and her beauty moved all hearts with love.  So stood she at the\r\nhigh-table; and those two who bore the burden set it down thereon and\r\ndrew off the covering, and lo! there was the Holy Boar of Yule on which\r\nmen were wont to make oath of deeds that they would do in the coming\r\nyear, according to the custom of their forefathers.  Then the Bride laid\r\nthe goodly sword beside the dish, and then went round the table and sat\r\ndown betwixt Face-of-god and Stone-face, and turned kindly to Gold-mane,\r\nand was glad; for now was his fair face as its wont was to be.  He in\r\nturn smiled upon her, for she was fair and kind and his fellow for many a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNow the men-at-arms stood each side the Boar, and out from them on each\r\nside stood the two hornsmen: then these blew up again, whereon the\r\nAlderman stood up and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye sons of the brave who have any deed that ye may be desirous of doing,\r\ncome up, come lay your hand on the sword, and the point of the sword to\r\nthe Holy Beast, and swear the oath that lieth on your hearts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he sat down, and there strode a man up the hall, strong-built\r\nand sturdy, but short of stature; black-haired, red-bearded, and\r\nruddy-faced: and he stood on the da\xc3\xafs, and took up the sword and laid its\r\npoint on the Boar, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Bristler, son of Brightling, a man of the Shepherds.  Here by the\r\nHoly Boar I swear to follow up the ransackers of Penny-thumb and the\r\nslayers of Rusty.  And I take this feud upon me, although they be no good\r\nmen, because I am of the kin and it falleth to me, since others forbear;\r\nand when the Court was hallowed hereon I was away out of the Dale and the\r\nDowns.  So help me the Warrior, and the God of the Earth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the Alderman nodded his head to him kindly, and reached him out a\r\ncup of wine, and as he drank there went up a rumour of praise from the\r\nhall; and men said that his oath was manly and that he was like to keep\r\nit; for he was a good man-at-arms and a stout heart.\r\n\r\nThen came up three men of the Shepherds and two of the Dale and swore to\r\nhelp Bristler in his feud, and men thought it well sworn.\r\n\r\nAfter that came a braggart, a man very gay of his raiment, and swore with\r\nmany words that if he lived the year through he would be a captain over\r\nthe men of the Plain, and would come back again with many gifts for his\r\nfriends in the Dale.  This men deemed foolishly sworn, for they knew the\r\nman; so they jeered at him and laughed as he went back to his place\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\nThen swore three others oaths not hard to be kept, and men laughed and\r\nwere merry.\r\n\r\nAt last uprose the Alderman, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Kinsmen, and good fellows, good\r\ndays and peaceable are in the Dale as now; and of such days little is the\r\nstory, and little it availeth to swear a deed of derring-do: yet three\r\nthings I swear by this Beast; and first to gainsay no man\xe2\x80\x99s asking if I\r\nmay perform it; and next to set right above law and mercy above custom;\r\nand lastly, if the days change and war cometh to us or we go to meet it,\r\nI will be no backwarder in the onset than three fathoms behind the\r\nforemost.  So help me the Warrior, and the God of the Face and the Holy\r\nEarth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he sat down, and all men shouted for joy of him, and said that\r\nit was most like that he would keep his oath.\r\n\r\nLast of all uprose Face-of-god and took up the sword and looked at it;\r\nand so bright was the blade that he saw in it the image of the golden\r\nbraveries which the Bride bore, and even some broken image of her face.\r\nThen he handled the hilt and laid the point on the Boar, and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hereby I swear to wed the fairest woman of the Earth before the year is\r\nworn to an end; and that whether the Dalesmen gainsay me or the men\r\nbeyond the Dale.  So help me the Warrior, and the God of the Face and the\r\nHoly Earth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he sat down; and once more men shouted for the love of him and\r\nof the Bride, and they said he had sworn well and like a chieftain.\r\n\r\nBut the Bride noted him that neither were his eyes nor his voice like to\r\ntheir wont as he swore, for she knew him well; and thereat was she ill at\r\nease, for now whatever was new in him was to her a threat of evil to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nStone-face also noted him, and he knew the young man better than all\r\nothers save the Bride, and he saw withal that she was ill-pleased, and he\r\nsaid to himself: \xe2\x80\x98I will speak to my fosterling to-morrow if I may find\r\nhim alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo came the swearing to an end, and they fell to on their meat and\r\nfeasted on the Boar of Atonement after they had duly given the Gods their\r\ndue share, and the wine went about the hall and men were merry till they\r\ndrank the parting cup and fared to rest in the shut-beds, and whereso\r\nelse they might in the Hall and the House, for there were many men there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.  STONE-FACE TELLETH CONCERNING THE WOOD-WIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY on the morrow Gold-mane arose and clad himself and went out-a-doors\r\nand over the trodden snow on to the bridge over the Weltering Water, and\r\nthere betook himself into one of the coins of safety built over the\r\nup-stream piles; there he leaned against the wall and turned his face to\r\nthe Thorp, and fell to pondering on his case.  And first he thought about\r\nhis oath, and how that he had sworn to wed the Mountain Woman, although\r\nhis kindred and her kindred should gainsay him, yea and herself also.\r\nGreat seemed that oath to him, yet at that moment he wished he had made\r\nit greater, and made all the kindred, yea and the Bride herself, sure of\r\nthe meaning of the words of it: and he deemed himself a dastard that he\r\nhad not done so.  Then he looked round him and beheld the winter, and he\r\nfell into mere longing that the spring were come and the token from the\r\nMountain.  Things seemed too hard for him to deal with, and he between a\r\nmighty folk and two wayward women; and he went nigh to wish that he had\r\ntaken his father\xe2\x80\x99s offer and gone down to the Cities; and even had he met\r\nhis bane: well were that!  And, as young folk will, he set to work making\r\na picture of his deeds there, had he been there.  He showed himself the\r\nstricken fight in the plain, and the press, and the struggle, and the\r\nbreaking of the serried band, and himself amidst the ring of foemen doing\r\nmost valiantly, and falling there at last, his shield o\xe2\x80\x99er-heavy with the\r\nweight of foemen\xe2\x80\x99s spears for a man to uphold it.  Then the victory of\r\nhis folk and the lamentation and praise over the slain man of the\r\nMountain Dales, and the burial of the valiant warrior, the praising\r\nweeping folk meeting him at the City-gate, laid stark and cold in his\r\narms on the gold-hung garlanded bier.\r\n\r\nThere ended his dream, and he laughed aloud and said: \xe2\x80\x98I am a fool!  All\r\nthis were good and sweet if I should see it myself; and forsooth that is\r\nhow I am thinking of it, as if I still alive should see myself dead and\r\nfamous!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he turned a little and looked at the houses of the Thorp lying dark\r\nabout the snowy ways under the starlit heavens of the winter morning:\r\ndark they were indeed and grey, save where here and there the half-burned\r\nYule-fire reddened the windows of a hall, or where, as in one place, the\r\ncandle of some early waker shone white in a chamber window.  There was\r\nscarce a man astir, he deemed, and no sound reached him save the crowing\r\nof the cocks muffled by their houses, and a faint sound of beasts in the\r\nbyres.\r\n\r\nThus he stood a while, his thoughts wandering now, till presently he\r\nheard footsteps coming his way down the street and turned toward them,\r\nand lo it was the old man Stone-face.  He had seen Gold-mane go out, and\r\nhad risen and followed him that he might talk with him apart.  Gold-mane\r\ngreeted him kindly, though, sooth to say, he was but half content to see\r\nhim; since he doubted, what was verily the case, that his foster-father\r\nwould give him many words, counselling him to refrain from going to the\r\nwood, and this was loathsome to him; but he spake and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meseems, father, that the eastern sky is brightening toward dawn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Stone-face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will be light in an hour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a fair day for the morrow of Yule,\xe2\x80\x99 said the swain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98and what wilt thou do with the fair day?  Wilt\r\nthou to the wood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Maybe, father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane; \xe2\x80\x98Hall-face and some of the swains are\r\ntalking of elks up the fells which may be trapped in the drifts, and if\r\nthey go a-hunting them, I may go in their company.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, son,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98thou wilt look to see other kind of beasts\r\nthan elks.  Things may ye fall in with there who may not be impounded in\r\nthe snow like to elks, but can go light-foot on the top of the soft drift\r\nfrom one place to another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98Father, fear me not; I shall either refrain me from the\r\nwood, or if I go, I shall go to hunt the wood-deer with other hunters.\r\nBut since thou hast come to me, tell me more about the wood, for thy\r\ntales thereof are fair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98fair tales of foul things, as oft it befalleth\r\nin the world.  Hearken now! if thou deemest that what thou seekest shall\r\ncome readier to thine hand because of the winter and the snow, thou\r\nerrest.  For the wights that waylay the bodies and souls of the mighty in\r\nthe wild-wood heed such matters nothing; yea and at Yule-tide are they\r\nmost abroad, and most armed for the fray.  Even such an one have I seen\r\ntime agone, when the snow was deep and the wind was rough; and it was in\r\nthe likeness of a woman clad in such raiment as the Bride bore last\r\nnight, and she trod the snow light-foot in thin raiment where it would\r\nscarce bear the skids of a deft snow-runner.  Even so she stood before\r\nme; the icy wind blew her raiment round about her, and drifted the hair\r\nfrom her garlanded head toward me, and she as fair and fresh as in the\r\nmidsummer days.  Up the fell she fared, sweetest of all things to look\r\non, and beckoned on me to follow; on me, the Warrior, the Stout-heart;\r\nand I followed, and between us grief was born; but I it was that fostered\r\nthat child and not she.  Always when she would be, was she merry and\r\nlovely; and even so is she now, for she is of those that be long-lived.\r\nAnd I wot that thou hast seen even such an one!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me more of thy tales, foster-father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane, \xe2\x80\x98and fear not\r\nfor me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, son,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98mayst thou have no such tales to tell to those that\r\nshall be young when thou art old.  Yet hearken!  We sat in the hall\r\ntogether and there was no third; and methought that the birds sang and\r\nthe flowers bloomed, and sweet was their savour, though it was midwinter.\r\nA rose-wreath was on her head; grapes were on the board, and fair\r\nunwrinkled summer apples on the day that we feasted together.  When was\r\nthe feast? sayst thou.  Long ago.  What was the hall, thou sayest,\r\nwherein ye feasted?  I know not if it were on the earth or under it, or\r\nif we rode the clouds that even.  But on the morrow what was there but\r\nthe stark wood and the drift of the snow, and the iron wind howling\r\nthrough the branches, and a lonely man, a wanderer rising from the\r\nground.  A wanderer through the wood and up the fell, and up the high\r\nmountain, and up and up to the edges of the ice-river and the green caves\r\nof the ice-hills.  A wanderer in spring, in summer, autumn and winter,\r\nwith an empty heart and a burning never-satisfied desire; who hath seen\r\nin the uncouth places many an evil unmanly shape, many a foul hag and\r\nchanging ugly semblance; who hath suffered hunger and thirst and wounding\r\nand fever, and hath seen many things, but hath never again seen that fair\r\nwoman, or that lovely feast-hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All praise and honour to the House of the Face, and the bounteous\r\nvaliant men thereof! and the like praise and honour to the fair women\r\nwhom they wed of the valiant and goodly House of the Steer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even so say I,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Gold-mane calmly; \xe2\x80\x98but now wend we aback to the\r\nHouse, for it is morning indeed, and folk will be stirring there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they turned from the bridge together; and Stone-face was kind and\r\nfatherly, and was telling his foster-son many wise things concerning the\r\nlife of a chieftain, and the giving-out of dooms and the gathering for\r\nbattle; to all which talk Face-of-god seemed to hearken gladly, but\r\nindeed hearkened not at all; for verily his eyes were beholding that\r\nsnowy waste, and the fair woman upon it; even such an one as Stone-face\r\nhad told of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.  THEY FARE TO THE HUNTING OF THE ELK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN they came into the Hall, the hearth-fire had been quickened, and the\r\nsleepers on the floor had been wakened, and all folk were astir.  So the\r\nold man sat down by the hearth while Gold-mane busied himself in fetching\r\nwood and water, and in sweeping out the Hall, and other such works of the\r\nearly morning.  In a little while Hall-face and the other young men and\r\nwarriors were afoot duly clad, and the Alderman came from his chamber and\r\ngreeted all men kindly.  Soon meat was set upon the boards, and men broke\r\ntheir fast; and day dawned while they were about it, and ere it was all\r\ndone the sun rose clear and golden, so that all men knew that the day\r\nwould be fair, for the frost seemed hard and enduring.\r\n\r\nThen the eager young men and the hunters, and those who knew the mountain\r\nbest drew together about the hearth, and fell to talking of the hunting\r\nof the elk; and there were three there who knew both the woods and also\r\nthe fells right up to the ice-rivers better than any other; and these\r\nsaid that they who were fain of the hunting of the elk would have no\r\nlikelier time than that day for a year to come.  Short was the rede\r\nbetwixt them, for they said they would go to the work at once and make\r\nthe most of the short winter daylight.  So they went each to his place,\r\nand some outside that House to their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 houses to fetch each man\r\nhis gear.  Face-of-god for his part went to his shut-bed, and stood by\r\nhis chest, and opened it, and drew out of it a fine hauberk of ring-mail\r\nwhich his father had made for him: for though Face-of-god was a deft\r\nwright, he was not by a long way so deft as his father, who was the\r\ndeftest of all men of that time and country; so that the alien merchants\r\nwould give him what he would for his hauberks and helms, whenso he would\r\nchaffer with them, which was but seldom.  So Face-of-god did on this\r\nhauberk over his kirtle, and over it he cast his foul-weather weed, so\r\nthat none might see it: he girt a strong war-sword to his side, cast his\r\nquiver over his shoulder, and took his bow in his hand, although he had\r\nlittle lust to shoot elks that day, even as Stone-face had said;\r\ntherewithal he took his skids, and went forth of the hall to the gate of\r\nthe Burg; whereto gathered the whole company of twenty-three, and\r\nGold-mane the twenty-fourth.  And each man there had his skids and his\r\nbow and quiver, and whatso other weapon, as short-sword, or wood-knife,\r\nor axe, seemed good to him.\r\n\r\nSo they went out-a-gates, and clomb the stairway in the cliff which led\r\nto the ancient watch-tower: for it was on the lower slopes of the fells\r\nwhich lay near to the Weltering Water that they looked to find the elks,\r\nand this was the nighest road thereto.  When they had gotten to the top\r\nthey lost no time, but went their ways nearly due east, making way easily\r\nwhere there were but scattered trees close to the lip of the sheer\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nThey went merrily on their skids over the close-lying snow, and were soon\r\nup on the great shoulders of the fells that went up from the bank of the\r\nWeltering Water: at noon they came into a little dale wherein were a few\r\ntrees, and there they abided to eat their meat, and were very merry,\r\nmaking for themselves tables and benches of the drifted snow, and piling\r\nit up to windward as a defence against the wind, which had now arisen,\r\nlittle but bitter from the south-east; so that some, and they the wisest,\r\nbegan to look for foul weather: wherefore they tarried the shorter while\r\nin the said dale or hollow.\r\n\r\nBut they were scarcely on their way again before the aforesaid south-east\r\nwind began to grow bigger, and at last blew a gale, and brought up with\r\nit a drift of fine snow, through which they yet made their way, but\r\nslowly, till the drift grew so thick that they could not see each other\r\nfive paces apart.\r\n\r\nThen perforce they made stay, and gathered together under a bent which by\r\ngood luck they happened upon, where they were sheltered from the worst of\r\nthe drift.  There they abode, till in less than an hour\xe2\x80\x99s space the drift\r\nabated and the wind fell, and in a little while after it was quite clear,\r\nwith the sun shining brightly and the young waxing moon white and high up\r\nin the heavens; and the frost was harder than ever.\r\n\r\nThis seemed good to them; but now that they could see each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces\r\nthey fell to telling over their company, and there was none missing save\r\nFace-of-god.  They were somewhat dismayed thereat, but knew not what to\r\ndo, and they deemed he might not be far off, either a little behind or a\r\nlittle ahead; and Hall-face said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no need to make this to-do about my brother; he can take good\r\ncare of himself; neither does a warrior of the Face die because of a\r\nlittle cold and frost and snow-drift.  Withal Gold-mane is a wilful man,\r\nand of late days hath been wilful beyond his wont; let us now find the\r\nelks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they went on their ways hoping to fall in with him again.  No long\r\nstory need be made of their hunting, for not very far from where they had\r\ntaken shelter they came upon the elks, many of them, impounded in the\r\ndrifts, pretty much where the deft hunters looked to find them.  There\r\nthen was battle between the elks and the men, till the beasts were all\r\nslain and only one man hurt: then they made them sleighs from wood which\r\nthey found in the hollows thereby, and they laid the carcasses thereon,\r\nand so turned their faces homeward, dragging their prey with them.  But\r\nthey met not Face-of-god either there or on the way home; and Hall-face\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Maybe Gold-mane will lie on the fell to-night; and I would I were\r\nwith him; for adventures oft befall such folk when they abide in the\r\nwilds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow it was late at night by then they reached Burgstead, so laden as they\r\nwere with the dead beasts; but they heeded the night little, for the moon\r\nwas well-nigh as bright as day for them.  But when they came to the gate\r\nof the Thorp, there were assembled the goodmen and swains to meet them\r\nwith torches and wine in their honour.  There also was Gold-mane come\r\nback before them, yea for these two hours; and he stood clad in his\r\nholiday raiment and smiled on them.\r\n\r\nThen was there some jeering at him that he was come back empty-handed\r\nfrom the hunting, and that he was not able to abide the wind and the\r\ndrift; but he laughed thereat, for all this was but game and play, since\r\nmen knew him for a keen hunter and a stout woodsman; and they had deemed\r\nit a heavy loss of him if he had been cast away, as some feared he had\r\nbeen: and his brother Hall-face embraced him and kissed him, and said to\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x98Now the next time that thou farest to the wood will I be with thee\r\nfoot to foot, and never leave thee, and then meseemeth I shall wot of the\r\ntale that hath befallen thee, and belike it shall be no sorry one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god laughed and answered but little, and they all betook them to\r\nthe House of the Face and held high feast therein, for as late as the\r\nnight was, in honour of this Hunting of the Elk.\r\n\r\nNo man cared to question Face-of-god closely as to how or where he had\r\nstrayed from the hunt; for he had told his own tale at once as soon as he\r\ncame home, to wit, that his right-foot skid-strap had broken, and even\r\nwhile he stopped to mend it came on that drift and weather; and that he\r\ncould not move from that place without losing his way, and that when it\r\nhad cleared he knew not whither they had gone because the snow had\r\ncovered their slot.  So he deemed it not unlike that they had gone back,\r\nand that he might come up with one or two on the way, and that in any\r\ncase he wotted well that they could look after themselves; so he turned\r\nback, not going very swiftly.  All this seemed like enough, and a little\r\nmatter except to jest about, so no man made any question concerning it:\r\nonly old Stone-face said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now were I fain to have a true tale out of him, but it is little likely\r\nthat anything shall come of my much questioning; and it is ill forcing a\r\nyoung man to tell lies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he held his peace, and the feast went on merrily and blithely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.  CONCERNING FACE-OF-GOD AND THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT it must be told of Gold-mane that what had befallen him was in this\r\nwise.  His skid-strap brake in good sooth, and he stayed to mend it; but\r\nwhen he had done what was needful, he looked up and saw no man nigh, what\r\nfor the drift, and that they had gone on somewhat; so he rose to his\r\nfeet, and without more delay, instead of keeping on toward the elk-ground\r\nand the way his face had been set, he turned himself north-and-by-east,\r\nand went his ways swiftly towards that a\xc3\xadrt, because he deemed that it\r\nmight lead him to the Mountain-hall where he had guested.  He abode not\r\nfor the storm to clear, but swept off through the thick of it; and indeed\r\nthe wind was somewhat at his back, so that he went the swiftlier.  But\r\nwhen the drift was gotten to its very worst, he sheltered himself for a\r\nlittle in a hollow behind a thorn-bush he stumbled upon.  As soon as it\r\nbegan to abate he went on again, and at last when it was quite clear, and\r\nthe sun shone out, he found himself on a long slope of the fells covered\r\ndeep with smooth white snow, and at the higher end a great crag rising\r\nbare fifty feet above the snow, and more rocks, but none so great, and\r\nbroken ground as he judged (the snow being deep) about it on the hither\r\nside; and on the further, three great pine-trees all bent down and\r\nmingled together by their load of snow.\r\n\r\nThitherward he made, as a man might, seeing nothing else to note before\r\nhim; but he had not made many strides when forth from behind the crag by\r\nthe pine-trees came a man; and at first Face-of-god thought it might be\r\none of his hunting-fellows gone astray, and he hailed him in a loud\r\nvoice, but as he looked he saw the sun flash back from a bright helm on\r\nthe new-comer\xe2\x80\x99s head; albeit he kept on his way till there was but a\r\nspace of two hundred yards between them; when lo! the helm-bearer notched\r\na shaft to his bent bow and loosed at Face-of-god, and the arrow came\r\nwhistling and passed six inches by his right ear.  Then Face-of-god\r\nstopped perplexed with his case; for he was on the deep snow in his\r\nskids, with his bow unbent, and he knew not how to bend it speedily.  He\r\nwas loth to turn his back and flee, and indeed he scarce deemed that it\r\nwould help him.  Meanwhile of his tarrying the archer loosed again at\r\nhim, and this time the shaft flew close to his left ear.  Then\r\nFace-of-god thought to cast himself down into the snow, but he was\r\nashamed; till there came a third shaft which flew over his head amidmost\r\nand close to it.  \xe2\x80\x98Good shooting on the Mountain!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered he; \xe2\x80\x98the next\r\nshaft will be amidst my breast, and who knows whether the Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandiwork will keep it out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he cried aloud: \xe2\x80\x98Thou shootest well, brother; but art thou a foe?  If\r\nthou art, I have a sword by my side, and so hast thou; come hither to me,\r\nand let us fight it out friendly if we must needs fight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA laugh came down the wind to him clear but somewhat shrill, and the\r\narcher came swiftly towards him on his skids with no weapon in his hand\r\nsave his bow; so that Face-of-god did not draw his sword, but stood\r\nwondering.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer he beheld the face of the new-comer, and deemed that\r\nhe had seen it before; and soon, for all that it was hooded close by the\r\nill-weather raiment, he perceived it to be the face of Bow-may, ruddy and\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nShe laughed out loud again, as she stopped herself within three feet of\r\nhim, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, friend Yellow-hair, we heard of the elks and looked to see thee\r\nhereabouts, and I knew thee at once when I came out from behind the crag\r\nand saw thee stand bewildered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98Hail to thee, Bow-may! and glad am I to see thee.  But\r\nthou liest in saying that thou knewest me; else why didst thou shoot\r\nthose three shafts at me?  Surely thou art not so quick as that with all\r\nthy friends: these be sharp greetings of you Mountain-folk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou lad with the sweet mouth,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I like to see thee and hear\r\nthee talk, but now must I hasten thy departure; so stand we here no\r\nlonger.  Let us get down into the wood where we can do off our skids and\r\nsit down, and then will I tell thee the tidings.  Come on!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she caught his hand in hers, and they went speedily down the slopes\r\ntoward the great oak-wood, the wind whistling past their ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whither are we going?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nSaid she: \xe2\x80\x98I am to show thee the way back home, which thou wilt not know\r\nsurely amidst this snow.  Come, no words! thou shalt not have my tale\r\nfrom me till we are in the wood: so the sooner we are there the sooner\r\nshalt thou be pleased.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Face-of-god held his peace, and they went on swiftly side by side.\r\nBut it was not Bow-may\xe2\x80\x99s wont to be silent for long, so presently she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou art good so do as I bid thee; but see thou, sweet playmate, for all\r\nthou art a chieftain\xe2\x80\x99s son, thou wert but feather-brained to ask me why I\r\nshot at thee.  I shoot at thee! that were a fine tale to tell her this\r\neven!  Or dost thou think that I could shoot at a big man on the snow at\r\ntwo hundred paces and miss him three times?  Unless I aimed to miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, Bow-may,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98art thou so deft a Bow-may?  Thou shalt be in\r\nmy company whenso I fare to battle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98therein thou sayest but the bare truth: nowhere else\r\nshall I be, and thou shalt find my bow no worse than a good shield.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed somewhat lightly; but she looked on him soberly and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laugh in that fashion on the day of battle, and we shall be well content\r\nwith thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo on they sped very swiftly, for their way was mostly down hill, so that\r\nthey were soon amongst the outskirting trees of the wood, and presently\r\nafter reached the edge of the thicket, beyond which the ground was but\r\nthinly covered with snow.\r\n\r\nThere they took off their skids, and went into the thick wood and sat\r\ndown under a hornbeam tree; and ere Gold-mane could open his mouth to\r\nspeak Bow-may began and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well it was that I fell in with thee, Dalesman, else had there been\r\nmurders of men to tell of; but ever she ordereth all things wisely,\r\nthough unwisely hast thou done to seek to her.  Hearken! dost thou think\r\nthat thou hast done well that thou hast me here with my tale?  Well,\r\nhadst thou busied thyself with the slaying of elks, or with sitting\r\nquietly at home, yet shouldest thou have heard my tale, and thou\r\nshouldest have seen me in Burgstead in a day or two to tell thee\r\nconcerning the flitting of the token.  And ill it is that I have missed\r\nit, for fain had I been to behold the House of the Face, and to have seen\r\nthee sitting there in thy dignity amidst the kindred of chieftains.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she sighed therewith.  But he said: \xe2\x80\x98Hold up thine heart, Bow-may!\r\nOn the word of a true man that shall befall thee one day.  But come,\r\nplaymate, give me thy tale!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I must now tell thee in the wild-wood what else I had\r\ntold thee in the Hall.  Hearken closely, for this is the message:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Seek not to me again till thou hast the token_; _else assuredly wilt\r\nthou be slain_, _and I shall be sorry for many a day_.  _Thereof as now I\r\nmay not tell thee more_.  _Now as to the token_: _When March is worn two\r\nweeks fail not to go to and fro on the place of the Maiden Ward for an\r\nhour before sunrise every day till thou hear tidings_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Bow-may, \xe2\x80\x98hast thou hearkened and understood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Then tell me the words of my message concerning the token.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd he did so word for word.  Then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well, there is no more to say.  Now must I lead thee till thou\r\nknowest the wood; and then mayst thou get on to the smooth snow again,\r\nand so home merrily.  Yet, thou grey-eyed fellow, I will have my pay of\r\nthee before I do that last work.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she turned about to him and took his head between her hands,\r\nand kissed him well favouredly both cheeks and mouth; and she laughed,\r\nalbeit the tears stood in her eyes as she said: \xe2\x80\x98Now smelleth the wood\r\nsweeter, and summer will come back again.  And even thus will I do once\r\nmore when we stand side by side in battle array.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe smiled kindly on her and nodded as they both rose up from the earth:\r\nshe had taken off her foul-weather gloves while they spake, and he kissed\r\nher hand, which was shapely of fashion albeit somewhat brown, and hard of\r\npalm, and he said in friendly wise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou art a merry faring-fellow, Bow-may, and belike shalt be withal a\r\ntrue fighting-fellow.  Come now, thou shalt be my sister and I thy\r\nbrother, in despite of those three shafts across the snow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed therewith; she laughed not, but seemed glad, and said soberly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, I may well be thy sister; for belike I also am of the people of the\r\nGods, who have come into these Dales by many far ways.  I am of the House\r\nof the Ragged Sword of the Kindred of the Wolf.  Come, brother, let us\r\ntoward Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she went before him and led through the thicket as by an\r\nassured and wonted path, and he followed hard at heel; but his thought\r\nwent from her for a while; for those words of brother and sister that he\r\nhad spoken called to his mind the Bride, and their kindness of little\r\nchildren, and the days when they seemed to have nought to do but to make\r\nthe sun brighter, and the flowers fairer, and the grass greener, and the\r\nbirds happier each for the other; and a hard and evil thing it seemed to\r\nhim that now he should be making all these things nought and dreary to\r\nher, now when he had become a man and deeds lay before him.  Yet again\r\nwas he solaced by what Bow-may had said concerning battle to come; for he\r\ndeemed that she must have had this from the Friend\xe2\x80\x99s foreseeing; and he\r\nlonged sore for deeds to do, wherein all these things might be cleared up\r\nand washen clean as it were.\r\n\r\nSo passed they through the wood a long way, and it was getting dark\r\ntherein, and Gold-mane said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold now, Bow-may, for I am at home here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked around and said: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, so it is: I was thinking of many\r\nthings.  Farewell and live merrily till March comes and the token!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she turned and went her ways and was soon out of sight, and he\r\nwent lightly through the wood, and then on skids over the hard snow along\r\nthe Dale\xe2\x80\x99s edge till he was come to the watch-tower, when the moon was\r\nbright in heaven.\r\n\r\nThus was he at Burgstead and the House of the Face betimes, and before\r\nthe hunters were gotten back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.  MURDER AMONGST THE FOLK OF THE WOODLANDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSO wore away midwinter tidingless.  Stone-face spake no more to\r\nFace-of-god about the wood and its wights, when he saw that the young man\r\nhad come back hale and merry, seemed not to crave over-much to go back\r\nthither.  As for the Bride, she was sad, and more than misdoubted all;\r\nbut dauntless as she was in matters that try men\xe2\x80\x99s hardihood, she yet\r\nlacked heart to ask of Face-of-god what had befallen him since the\r\nautumn-tide, or where he was with her.  So she put a force upon herself\r\nnot to look sad or craving when she was in his company, as full oft she\r\nwas; for he rather sought her than shunned her.  For when he saw her\r\nthus, he deemed things were changing with her as they had changed with\r\nhim, and he bethought him of what he had spoken to Bow-may, and deemed\r\nthat even so he might speak with the Bride when the time came, and that\r\nshe would not be grieved beyond measure, and all would be well.\r\n\r\nNow came on the thaw, and the snow went, and the grass grew all up and\r\ndown the Dale, and all waters were big.  And about this time arose\r\nrumours of strange men in the wood, uncouth, vile, and murderous, and\r\nmany of the feebler sort were made timorous thereby.\r\n\r\nBut a little before March was born came new tidings from the Woodlanders;\r\nto wit: There came on a time to the house of a woodland carle, a worthy\r\ngoodman well renowned of all, two wayfarers in the first watch of the\r\nnight; and these men said that they were wending down to the Plain from a\r\nfar-away dale, Rose-dale to wit, which all men had heard of, and that\r\nthey had strayed from the way and were exceeding weary, and they craved a\r\nmeal\xe2\x80\x99s meat and lodging for the night.\r\n\r\nThis the goodman might nowise gainsay, and he saw no harm in it,\r\nwherefore he bade them abide and be merry.\r\n\r\nThese men, said they who told the tidings, were outlanders, and no man\r\nhad seen any like them before: they were armed, and bore short bows made\r\nof horn, and round targets, and coats-of-fence done over with horn\r\nscales; they had crooked swords girt to their sides, and axes of steel\r\nforged all in one piece, right good weapons.  They were clad in scarlet\r\nand had much silver on their raiment and about their weapons, and great\r\nrings of the same on their arms; and all this silver seemed brand-new.\r\n\r\nNow the Woodland Carle gave them of such things as he had, and was kind\r\nand blithe to them: there were in his house besides himself five men of\r\nhis sons and kindred, and his wife and three daughters and two other\r\nmaids.  So they feasted after the Woodlanders\xe2\x80\x99 fashion, and went to bed a\r\nlittle before midnight.  Two hours after, the carle awoke and heard a\r\nlittle stir, and he looked and saw the guests on their feet amidst the\r\nhall clad in all their war-gear; and they had betwixt them his two\r\nyoungest daughters, maids of fifteen and twelve winters, and had bound\r\ntheir hands and done clouts over their mouths, so that they might not cry\r\nout; and they were just at point to carry them off.  Thereat the goodman,\r\nnaked as he was, caught up his sword and made at these murder-carles, and\r\nor ever they were ware of him he had hewn down one and turned to face the\r\nother, who smote at him with his steel axe and gave him a great wound on\r\nthe shoulder, and therewithal fled out at the open door and forth into\r\nthe wood.\r\n\r\nThe Woodlander made no stay to raise the cry (there was no need, for the\r\nhall was astir now from end to end, and men getting to their weapons),\r\nbut ran out after the felon even as he was; and, in spite of his grievous\r\nhurt, overran him no long way from the house before he had gotten into\r\nthe thicket.  But the man was nimble and strong, and the goodman unsteady\r\nfrom his wound, and by then the others of the household came up with the\r\nhue and cry he had gotten two more sore wounds and was just making an end\r\nof throttling the felon with his bare hands.  So he fell into their arms\r\nfainting from weakness, and for all they could do he died in two hours\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime from that axe-wound in his shoulder, and another on the side of the\r\nhead, and a knife-thrust in his side; and he was a man of sixty winters.\r\n\r\nBut the stranger he had slain outright; and the one whom he had smitten\r\nin the hall died before the dawn, thrusting all help aside, and making no\r\nsound of speech.\r\n\r\nWhen these tidings came to Burgstead they seemed great to men, and to\r\nGold-mane more than all.  So he and many others took their weapons and\r\nfared up to Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way, and so came to the Woodland Carles.  But the\r\nWoodlanders had borne out the carcasses of those felons and laid them on\r\nthe green before Wood-grey\xe2\x80\x99s door (for that was the name of the dead\r\ngoodman), and they were saying that they would not bury such accursed\r\nfolk, but would bear them a little way so that they should not be vexed\r\nwith the stink of them, and cast them into the thicket for the wolf and\r\nthe wild-cat and the stoat to deal with; and they should lie there,\r\nweapons and silver and all; and they deemed it base to strip such\r\nwretches, for who would wear their raiment or bear their weapons after\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere was a great ring of folk round about them when they of Burgstead\r\ndrew near, and they shouted for joy to see their neighbours, and made way\r\nbefore them.  Then the Dalesmen cursed these murderers who had slain so\r\ngood a man, and they all praised his manliness, whereas he ran out into\r\nthe night naked and wounded after his foe, and had fallen like his folk\r\nof old time.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright spring afternoon in that clearing of the Wood, and they\r\nlooked at the two dead men closely; and Gold-mane, who had been somewhat\r\nsilent and moody till then, became merry and wordy; for he beheld the men\r\nand saw that they were utterly strange to him: they were short of\r\nstature, crooked-legged, long-armed, very strong for their size: with\r\nsmall blue eyes, snubbed-nosed, wide-mouthed, thin-lipped, very swarthy\r\nof skin, exceeding foul of favour.  He and all others wondered who they\r\nwere, and whence they came, for never had they seen their like; and the\r\nWoodlanders, who often guested outlanders strayed from the way of divers\r\nkindreds and nations, said also that none such had they ever seen.  But\r\nStone-face, who stood by Gold-mane, shook his head and quoth he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Wild-wood holdeth many marvels, and these be of them: the spawn of\r\nevil wights quickeneth therein, and at other whiles it melteth away again\r\nlike the snow; so may it be with these carcasses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd some of the older folk of the Woodlanders who stood by hearkened what\r\nhe said, and deemed his words wise, for they remembered their ancient\r\nlore and many a tale of old time.\r\n\r\nThereafter they of Burgstead went into Wood-grey\xe2\x80\x99s hall, or as many of\r\nthem as might, for it was but a poor place and not right great.  There\r\nthey saw the goodman laid on the da\xc3\xafs in all his war-gear, under the last\r\ntie-beam of his hall, whereon was carved amidst much goodly work of knots\r\nand flowers and twining stems the image of the Wolf of the Waste, his\r\njaws open and gaping: the wife and daughters of the goodman and other\r\nwomen of the folk stood about the bier singing some old song in a low\r\nvoice, and some sobbing therewithal, for the man was much beloved: and\r\nmuch people of the Woodlanders was in the hall, and it was somewhat dusk\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nSo the Burgstead men greeted that folk kindly and humbly, and again they\r\nfell to praising the dead man, saying how his deed should long be\r\nremembered in the Dale and wide about; and they called him a fearless man\r\nand of great worth.  And the women hearkened, and ceased their crooning\r\nand their sobbing, and stood up proudly and raised their heads with\r\ngleaming eyes; and as the words of the Burgstead men ended, they lifted\r\nup their voices and sang loudly and clearly, standing together in a row,\r\nten of them, on the da\xc3\xafs of that poor hall, facing the gable and the\r\nwolf-adorned tie-beam, heeding nought as they sang what was about or\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nAnd this is some of what they sang:\r\n\r\n   Why sit ye bare in the spinning-room?\r\n   Why weave ye naked at the loom?\r\n\r\n   Bare and white as the moon we be,\r\n   That the Earth and the drifting night may see.\r\n\r\n   Now what is the worst of all your work?\r\n   What curse amidst the web shall lurk?\r\n\r\n   The worst of the work our hands shall win\r\n   Is wrack and ruin round the kin.\r\n\r\n   Shall the woollen yarn and the flaxen thread\r\n   Be gear for living men or dead?\r\n\r\n   The woollen yarn and the flaxen thread\r\n   Shall flare \xe2\x80\x99twixt living men and dead.\r\n\r\n   O what is the ending of your day?\r\n   When shall ye rise and wend away?\r\n\r\n   Our day shall end to-morrow morn,\r\n   When we hear the voice of the battle-horn.\r\n\r\n   Where first shall eyes of men behold\r\n   This weaving of the moonlight cold?\r\n\r\n   There where the alien host abides\r\n   The gathering on the Mountain-sides.\r\n\r\n   How long aloft shall the fair web fly\r\n   When the bows are bent and the spears draw nigh?\r\n\r\n   From eve to morn and morn till eve\r\n   Aloft shall fly the work we weave.\r\n\r\n   What then is this, the web ye win?\r\n   What wood-beast waxeth stark therein?\r\n\r\n   We weave the Wolf and the gift of war\r\n   From the men that were to the men that are.\r\n\r\nSo sang they: and much were all men moved at their singing, and there was\r\nnone but called to mind the old days of the Fathers, and the years when\r\ntheir banner went wide in the world.\r\n\r\nBut the Woodlanders feasted them of Burgstead what they might, and then\r\nwent the Dalesmen back to their houses; but on the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s morrow they\r\nfared thither again, and Wood-grey was laid in mound amidst a great\r\nassemblage of the Folk.\r\n\r\nMany men said that there was no doubt that those two felons were of the\r\ncompany of those who had ransacked the steads of Penny-thumb and\r\nHarts-bane; and so at first deemed Bristler the son of Brightling: but\r\nafter a while, when he had had time to think of it, he changed his mind;\r\nfor he said that such men as these would have slain first and ransacked\r\nafterwards: and some who loved neither Penny-thumb nor Harts-bane said\r\nthat they would not have been at the pains to choose for ransacking the\r\ntwo worst men about the Dale, whose loss was no loss to any but\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAs for Gold-mane he knew not what to think, except that his friends of\r\nthe Mountain had had nought to do with it.\r\n\r\nSo wore the days awhile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.  THE BRIDE SPEAKETH WITH FACE-OF-GOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY had died into March, and March was now twelve days old, on a\r\nfair and sunny day an hour before noon; and Face-of-god was in a meadow a\r\nscant mile down the Dale from Burgstead.  He had been driving a bull into\r\na goodman\xe2\x80\x99s byre nearby, and had had to spend toil and patience both in\r\ngetting him out of the fields and into the byre; for the beast was hot\r\nwith the spring days and the new grass.  So now he was resting himself in\r\nhappy mood in an exceeding pleasant place, a little meadow to wit, on one\r\nside whereof was a great orchard or grove of sweet chestnuts, which went\r\nright up to the feet of the Southern Cliffs: across the meadow ran a\r\nclear brook towards the Weltering Water, free from big stones, in some\r\nplaces dammed up for the flooding of the deep pasture-meadow, and with\r\nthe grass growing on its lips down to the very water.  There was a low\r\nbank just outside the chestnut trees, as if someone had raised a dyke\r\nabout them when they were young, which had been trodden low and spreading\r\nthrough the lapse of years by the faring of many men and beasts.  The\r\nprimroses bloomed thick upon it now, and here and there along it was a\r\nlow blackthorn bush in full blossom; from the mid-meadow and right down\r\nto the lip of the brook was the grass well nigh hidden by the blossoms of\r\nthe meadow-saffron, with daffodils sprinkled about amongst them, and in\r\nthe trees and bushes the birds, and chiefly the blackbirds, were singing\r\ntheir loudest.\r\n\r\nThere sat Face-of-god on the bank resting after his toil, and happy was\r\nhis mood; since in two days\xe2\x80\x99 wearing he should be pacing the Maiden Ward\r\nawaiting the token that was to lead him to Shadowy Vale; so he sat\r\ncalling to mind the Friend as he had last seen her, and striving as it\r\nwere to set her image standing on the flowery grass before him, till all\r\nthe beauty of the meadow seemed bare and empty to him without her.  Then\r\nit fell into his mind that this had been a beloved trysting-place betwixt\r\nhim and the Bride, and that often when they were little would they come\r\nto gather chestnuts in the grove, and thereafter sit and prattle on the\r\nold dyke; or in spring when the season was warm would they go barefoot\r\ninto the brook, seeking its treasures of troutlets and flowers and\r\nclean-washed agate pebbles.  Yea, and time not long ago had they met here\r\nto talk as lovers, and sat on that very bank in all the kindness of good\r\ndays without a blemish, and both he and she had loved the place well for\r\nits wealth of blossoms and deep grass and goodly trees and clear running\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nAs he thought of all this, and how often there he had praised to himself\r\nher beauty, which he scarce dared praise to her, he frowned and slowly\r\nrose to his feet, and turned toward the chestnut-grove, as though he\r\nwould go thence that way; but or ever he stepped down from the dyke he\r\nturned about again, and even therewith, like the very image and ghost of\r\nhis thought, lo! the Bride herself coming up from out the brook and\r\nwending toward him, her wet naked feet gleaming in the sun as they trod\r\ndown the tender meadow-saffron and brushed past the tufts of daffodils.\r\nHe stood staring at her discomforted, for on that day he had much to\r\nthink of that seemed happy to him, and he deemed that she would now\r\nquestion him, and his mind pondered divers ways of answering her, and\r\nnone seemed good to him.  She drew near and let her skirts fall over her\r\nfeet, and came to him, her gown hem dragging over the flowers: then she\r\nstood straight up before him and greeted him, but reached not forth her\r\nhand to him nor touched him.  Her face was paler that its wont, and her\r\nvoice trembled as she spake to him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Face-of-god, I would ask thee a gift.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All gifts,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98that thou mayest ask, and I may give, lie open to\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98If I be alive when the time comes this gift thou mayst well\r\ngive me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sweet kinswoman,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98tell me what it is that thou wouldest have\r\nof me.\xe2\x80\x99  And he was ill-at-ease as he waited for her answer.\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, kinsman, kinsman!  Woe on the day that maketh kinship\r\naccursed to me because thou desirest it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe held his peace and was exceeding sorry; and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the gift that I ask of thee, that in the days to come when thou\r\nart wedded, thou wilt give me the second man-child whom thou begettest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98This shalt thou have, and would that I might give thee much\r\nmore.  Would that we were little children together other again, as when\r\nwe played here in other days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98I would have a token of thee that thou shalt show to the God,\r\nand swear on it to give me the gift.  For the times change.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What token wilt thou have?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98When next thou farest to the Wood, thou shalt bring me back,\r\nit maybe a flower from the bank ye sit upon, or a splinter from the da\xc3\xafs\r\nof the hall wherein ye feast, or maybe a ring or some matter that the\r\nstrangers are wont to wear.  That shall be the token.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe spoke slowly, hanging her head adown, but she lifted it presently and\r\nlooked into his face and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Woe\xe2\x80\x99s me, woe\xe2\x80\x99s me, Gold-mane!  How evil is this day, when bewailing me\r\nI may not bewail thee also!  For I know that thine heart is glad.  All\r\nthrough the winter have I kept this hidden in my heart, and durst not\r\nspeak to thee.  But now the spring-tide hath driven me to it.  Let summer\r\ncome, and who shall say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGreat was his grief, and his shame kept him silent, and he had no word to\r\nsay; and again she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, Gold-mane, when goest thou thither?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98I know not surely, may happen in two days, may happen in ten.\r\nWhy askest thou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O friend!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98is it a new thing that I should ask thee whither\r\nthou goest and whence thou comest, and the times of thy coming and going.\r\nFarewell to-day!  Forget not the token.  Woe\xe2\x80\x99s me, that I may not kiss\r\nthy fair face!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe spread her arms abroad and lifted up her face as one who waileth, but\r\nno sound came from her lips; then she turned about and went away as she\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nBut as for him he stood there after she was gone in all confusion, as if\r\nhe were undone: for he felt his manhood lessened that he should thus and\r\nso sorely have hurt a friend, and in a manner against his will.  And yet\r\nhe was somewhat wroth with her, that she had come upon him so suddenly,\r\nand spoken to him with such mastery, and in so few words, and he with\r\nnone to make answer to her, and that she had so marred his pleasure and\r\nhis hope of that fair day.  Then he sat him down again on the flowery\r\nbank, and little by little his heart softened, and he once more called to\r\nmind many a time when they had been there before, and the plays and the\r\ngames they had had together there when they were little.  And he\r\nbethought him of the days that were long to him then, and now seemed\r\nshort to him, and as if they were all grown together into one story, and\r\nthat a sweet one.  Then his breast heaved with a sob, and the tears rose\r\nto his eyes and burned and stung him, and he fell a-weeping for that\r\nsweet tale, and wept as he had wept once before on that old dyke when\r\nthere had been some child\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel between them, and she had gone away\r\nand left him.\r\n\r\nThen after a while he ceased his weeping, and looked about him lest\r\nanyone might be coming, and then he arose and went to and fro in the\r\nchestnut-grove for a good while, and afterwards went his ways from that\r\nmeadow, saying to himself: \xe2\x80\x98Yet remaineth to me the morrow of to-morrow,\r\nand that is the first of the days of the watching for the token.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut all that day he was slow to meet the eyes of men; and in the hall\r\nthat eve he was silent and moody; for from time to time it came over him\r\nthat some of his manhood had departed from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.  THE TOKEN COMETH FROM THE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day wore away tidingless; and the day after Face-of-god arose\r\nbetimes; for it was the first day of his watch, and he was at the Maiden\r\nWard before the time appointed on a very fair and bright morning, and he\r\nwent to and fro on that place, and had no tidings.  So he came away\r\nsomewhat cast down, and said within himself: \xe2\x80\x98Is it but a lie and a\r\nmocking when all is said?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the morrow he went thither again, and the morn was wild and stormy\r\nwith drift of rain, and low clouds hurrying over the earth, though for\r\nthe sunrise they lifted a little in the east, and the sun came up over\r\nthe passes, amidst the red and angry rack of clouds.  This morn also gave\r\nhim no tidings of the token, and he was wroth and perturbed in spirit:\r\nbut towards evening he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well: ten days she gave me, so that she might be able to send\r\nwithout fail on one of them; she will not fail me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo again on the morrow he was there betimes, and the morn was windy as on\r\nthe day before, but the clouds higher and of better promise for the day.\r\nFace-of-god walked to and fro on the Maiden Ward, and as he turned toward\r\nBurgstead for the tenth time, he heard, as he deemed, a bow-string twang\r\nafar off, and even therewith came a shaft flying heavily like a winged\r\nbird, which smote a great standing stone on the other side of the way,\r\nwhere of old some chieftain had been buried, and fell to earth at its\r\nfoot.  He went up to it and handled it, and saw that there was a piece of\r\nthin parchment wrapped about it, which indeed he was eager to unwrap at\r\nonce, but forebore; because he was on the highway, and people were\r\nalready astir, and even then passed by him a goodman of the Dale with a\r\nman of his going afield together, and they gave him the sele of the day.\r\nSo he went along the highway a little till he came to a place where was a\r\nfootbridge over into the meadow.  He crossed thereby and went swiftly\r\ntill he reached a rising ground grown over with hazel-trees; there he sat\r\ndown among the rabbit-holes, the primrose and wild-garlic blooming about\r\nhim, and three blackbirds answering one another from the edges of the\r\ncoppice.  Straightway when he had looked and seen none coming he broke\r\nthe threads that were wound about the scroll and the arrow, and unrolled\r\nthe parchment; and there was writing thereon in black ink of small\r\nletters, but very fair, and this is what he read therein:\r\n\r\n    _Come thou to the Mountain Hall by the path which thou knowest of_,\r\n    _on the morrow of the day whereon thou readest this_.  _Rise betimes\r\n    and come armed_, _for there are other men than we in the wood_; _to\r\n    whom thy death should be a gain_.  _When thou art come to the Hall_,\r\n    _thou shalt find no man therein_; _but a great hound only_, _tied to\r\n    a bench nigh the da\xc3\xafs_.  _Call him by his name_, _Sure-foot to wit_,\r\n    _and give him to eat from the meat upon the board_, _and give him\r\n    water __to drink_.  _If the day is then far spent_, _as it is like to\r\n    be_, _abide thou with the hound in the hall through the night_, _and\r\n    eat of what thou shalt find there_; _but see that the hound fares not\r\n    abroad till the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s morn_: _then lead him out and bring him to\r\n    the north-east corner of the Hall_, _and he shall lift the slot for\r\n    thee that leadeth to the Shadowy Yale_.  _Follow him and all good go\r\n    with thee_.\r\n\r\nNow when he had read this, earth seemed fair indeed about him, and he\r\nscarce knew whither to turn or what to do to make the most of his joy.\r\nHe presently went back to Burgstead and into the House of the Face, where\r\nall men were astir now, and the day was clearing.  He hid the shaft under\r\nhis kirtle, for he would not that any should see it; so he went to his\r\nshut-bed and laid it up in his chest, wherein he kept his chiefest\r\ntreasures; but the writing on the scroll he set in his bosom and so hid\r\nit.  He went joyfully and proudly, as one who knoweth more tidings and\r\nbetter than those around him.  But Stone-face beheld him, and said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Foster-son, thou art happy.  Is it that the spring-tide is in thy blood,\r\nand maketh thee blithe with all things, or hast thou some new tidings?\r\nNay, I would not have an answer out of thee; but here is good rede: when\r\nnext thou goest into the wood, it were nought so ill for thee to have a\r\nvaliant old carle by thy side; one that loveth thee, and would die for\r\nthee if need were; one who might watch when thou wert seeking.  Or else\r\nbeware! for there are evil things abroad in the Wood, and moreover the\r\nbrethren of those two felons who were slain at Carlstead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Gold-mane constrained himself to answer the old carle softly; and he\r\nthanked him kindly for his offer, and said that so it should be before\r\nlong.  So the talk between them fell, and Stone-face went away somewhat\r\nwell-pleased.\r\n\r\nAnd now was Face-of-god become wary; and he would not draw men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and\r\nspeech on him; so he went afield with Hall-face to deal with the lambs\r\nand the ewes, and did like other men.  No less wary was he in the hall\r\nthat even, and neither spake much nor little; and when his father spake\r\nto him concerning the Bride, and made game of him as a somewhat sluggish\r\ngroom, he did not change countenance, but answered lightly what came to\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow ere the earliest dawn he was afoot, and he clad himself and\r\ndid on his hauberk, his father\xe2\x80\x99s work, which was fine-wrought and a stout\r\ndefence, and reached down to his knees; and over that he did on a goodly\r\ngreen kirtle well embroidered: he girt his war-sword to his side, and it\r\nwas the work of his father\xe2\x80\x99s father, and a very good sword: its name was\r\nDale-warden.  He did a good helm on his head, and slung a targe at his\r\nback, and took two spears in his hand, short but strong-shafted and\r\nwell-steeled.  Thus arrayed he left Burgstead before the dawn, and came\r\nto Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way and betook him to the Woodland.  He made no stop or\r\nstay on the path, but ate his meat standing by an oak-tree close by the\r\nhalf-blind track.  When he came to the little wood-lawn, where was the\r\ntoft of the ancient house, he looked all round about him, for he deemed\r\nthat a likely place for those ugly wood-wights to set on him; but nought\r\nbefell him, though he stooped and drank of the woodland rill warily\r\nenough.  So he passed on; and there were other places also where he fared\r\nwarily, because they seemed like to hold lurking felons; though forsooth\r\nthe whole wood might well serve their turn.  But no evil befell him, and\r\nat last, when it yet lacked an hour to sunset, he came to the wood-lawn\r\nwhere Wild-wearer had made his onset that other eve.\r\n\r\nHe went straight up to the house, his heart beating, and he scarce\r\nbelieving but that he should find the Friend abiding him there: but when\r\nhe pushed the door it gave way before him at once, and he entered and\r\nfound no man therein, and the walls stripped bare and no shield or weapon\r\nhanging on the panels.  But the hound he saw tied to a bench nigh the\r\nda\xc3\xafs, and the bristles on the beast\xe2\x80\x99s neck arose, and he snarled on\r\nFace-of-god, and strained on his leathern leash.  Then Face-of-god went\r\nup to him and called him by his name, Sure-foot, and gave him his hand to\r\nlick, and he brought him water, and fed him with flesh from the meat on\r\nthe board; so the beast became friendly and wagged his tail and whined\r\nand slobbered his hand.\r\n\r\nThen he went all about the house, and saw and heard no living thing\r\ntherein save the mice in the panels and Sure-foot.  So he came back to\r\nthe da\xc3\xafs, and sat him down at the board and ate his fill, and thought\r\nconcerning his case.  And it came into his mind that the Woman of the\r\nMountain had some deed for him to do which would try his manliness and\r\nexalt his fame; and his heart rose high and he was glad, and he saw\r\nhimself sitting beside her on the da\xc3\xafs of a very fair hall beloved and\r\nhonoured of all the folk, and none had aught to say against him or owed\r\nhim any grudge.  Thus he pleased himself in thinking of the good days to\r\ncome, sitting there till the hall grew dusk and dark and the night-wind\r\nmoaned about it.\r\n\r\nThen after a while he arose and raked together the brands on the hearth,\r\nand made light in the hall and looked to the door.  And he found there\r\nwere bolts and bars thereto, so he shot the bolts and drew the bars into\r\ntheir places and made all as sure as might be.  Then he brought Sure-foot\r\ndown from the da\xc3\xafs, and tied him up so that he might lie down athwart the\r\ndoor, and then lay down his hauberk with his naked sword ready to his\r\nhand, and slept long while.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was darker than when he had lain him for the moon had\r\nset; yet he deemed that the day was at point of breaking.  So he fetched\r\nwater and washed the night off him, and saw a little glimmer of the dawn.\r\nThen he ate somewhat of the meat on the board, and did on his helm and\r\nhis other gear, and unbarred the door, and led Sure-foot without, and\r\nbrought him to the north-east corner of the house, and in a little while\r\nhe lifted the slot and they departed, the man and the hound, just as\r\nbroke dawn from over the mountains.\r\n\r\nSure-foot led right into the heart of the pine-wood, and it was dark\r\nenough therein, with nought but a feeble glimmer for some while, and long\r\nwas the way therethrough; but in two hours\xe2\x80\x99 space was there something of\r\na break, and they came to the shore of a dark deep tarn on whose windless\r\nand green waters the daylight shone fully.  The hound skirted the water,\r\nand led on unchecked till the trees began to grow smaller and the air\r\ncolder for all that the sun was higher; for they had been going up and up\r\nall the way.\r\n\r\nSo at last after a six hours\xe2\x80\x99 journey they came clean out of the\r\npine-wood, and before them lay the black wilderness of the bare\r\nmountains, and beyond them, looking quite near now, the great ice-peaks,\r\nthe wall of the world.  It was but an hour short of noon by this time,\r\nand the high sun shone down on a barren boggy moss which lay betwixt them\r\nand the rocky waste.  Sure-foot made no stay, but threaded the ways that\r\nwent betwixt the quagmires, and in another hour led Face-of-god into a\r\nwinding valley blinded by great rocks, and everywhere stony and rough,\r\nwith a trickle of water running amidst of it.  The hound fared on up the\r\ndale to where the water was bridged by a great fallen stone, and so over\r\nit and up a steep bent on the further side, on to a marvellously rough\r\nmountain-neck, whiles mere black sand cumbered with scattered rocks and\r\nstones, whiles beset with mires grown over with the cottony mire-grass;\r\nhere and there a little scanty grass growing; otherwhere nought but dwarf\r\nwillow ever dying ever growing, mingled with moss or red-blossomed\r\nsengreen; and all blending together into mere desolation.\r\n\r\nFew living things they saw there; up on the neck a few sheep were grazing\r\nthe scanty grass, but there was none to tend them; yet Face-of-god deemed\r\nthe sight of them good, for there must be men anigh who owned them.  For\r\nthe rest, the whimbrel laughed across the mires; high up in heaven a\r\ngreat eagle was hanging; once and again a grey fox leapt up before them,\r\nand the heath-fowl whirred up from under Face-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s feet.  A raven who\r\nwas sitting croaking on a rock in that first dale stirred uneasily on his\r\nperch as he saw them, and when they were passed flapped his wings and\r\nflew after them croaking still.\r\n\r\nNow they fared over that neck somewhat east, making but slow way because\r\nthe ground was so broken and rocky; and in another hour\xe2\x80\x99s space Sure-foot\r\nled down-hill due east to where the stony neck sank into another desolate\r\nmiry heath still falling toward the east, but whose further side was\r\nwalled by a rampart of crags cleft at their tops into marvellous-shapes,\r\ncoal-black, ungrassed and unmossed.  Thitherward the hound led straight,\r\nand Gold-mane followed wondering: as he drew near them he saw that they\r\nwere not very high, the tallest peak scant fifty feet from the face of\r\nthe heath.\r\n\r\nThey made their way through the scattered rocks at the foot of these\r\ncrags, till, just where the rock-wall seemed the closest, the way through\r\nthe stones turned into a path going through it skew-wise; and it was now\r\nso clear a path that belike it had been bettered by men\xe2\x80\x99s hands.  Down\r\nthereby Face-of-god followed the hound, deeming that he was come to the\r\ngates of the Shadowy Vale, and the path went down steeply and swiftly.\r\nBut when he had gone down a while, the rocks on his right hand sank lower\r\nfor a space, so that he could look over and see what lay beneath.\r\n\r\nThere lay below him a long narrow vale quite plain at the bottom, walled\r\non the further side as on the hither by sheer rocks of black stone.  The\r\nplain was grown over with grass, but he could see no tree therein: a deep\r\nriver, dark and green, ran through the vale, sometimes through its\r\nmidmost, sometimes lapping the further rock-wall: and he thought indeed\r\nthat on many a day in the year the sun would never shine on that valley.\r\n\r\nThus much he saw, and then the rocks rose again and shut it from his\r\nsight; and at last they drew so close together over head that he was in a\r\nway going through a cave with little daylight coming from above, and in\r\nthe end he was in a cave indeed and mere darkness: but with the last\r\nfeeble glimmer of light he thought he saw carved on a smooth space of the\r\nliving rock at his left hand the image of a wolf.\r\n\r\nThis cave lasted but a little way, and soon the hound and the man were\r\ngoing once more between sheer black rocks, and the path grew steeper yet\r\nand was cut into steps.  At last there was a sharp turn, and they stood\r\non the top of a long stony scree, down which Sure-foot bounded eagerly,\r\ngiving tongue as he went; but Face-of-god stood still and looked, for now\r\nthe whole Dale lay open before him.\r\n\r\nThat river ran from north to south, and at the south end the cliffs drew\r\nso close to it that looking thence no outgate could be seen; but at the\r\nnorth end there was as it were a dreary street of rocks, the river\r\nflowing amidmost and leaving little foothold on either side, somewhat as\r\nit was with the pass leading from the mountains into Burgdale.\r\n\r\nAmidmost of the Dale a little toward the north end he saw a doom-ring of\r\nblack stones, and hard by it an ancient hall builded of the same black\r\nstone both wall and roof, and thitherward was Sure-foot now running.\r\nFace-of-god looked up and down the Dale and could see no break in the\r\nwall of sheer rock: toward the southern end he saw a few booths and cots\r\nbuilt roughly of stone and thatched with turf; thereabout he saw a few\r\nfolk moving about, the most of whom seemed to be women and children;\r\nthere were some sheep and lambs near these cots, and a herd of fifty or\r\nso of somewhat goodly mountain-kine were feeding higher up the valley.\r\nHe could look down into the river from where he stood, and he saw that it\r\nran between rocky banks going straight down from the face of the meadow,\r\nwhich was rather high above the water, so that it seemed little likely\r\nthat the water should rise over its banks, either in summer or winter;\r\nand in summer was it like to be highest, because the vale was so near to\r\nthe high mountains and their snows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE FRIEND IN SHADOWY VALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was now about two hours after noon, and a broad band of sunlight lay\r\nupon the grass of the vale below Gold-mane\xe2\x80\x99s feet; he went lightly down\r\nthe scree, and strode forward over the level grass toward the Doom-ring,\r\nhis helm and war-gear glittering bright in the sun.  He must needs go\r\nthrough the Doom-ring to come to the Hall, and as he stepped out from\r\nbehind the last of the big upright-stones, he saw a woman standing on the\r\nthreshold of the Hall-door, which was but some score of paces from him,\r\nand knew her at once for the Friend.\r\n\r\nShe was clad like himself in a green kirtle gaily embroidered and fitting\r\nclose to her body, and had no gown or cloak over it; she had a golden\r\nfillet on her head beset with blue mountain stones, and her hair hung\r\nloose behind her.\r\n\r\nHer beauty was so exceeding, and so far beyond all memory of her that his\r\nmind had held, that once more fear of her fell upon Face-of-god, and he\r\nstood still with beating heart till she should speak to him.  But she\r\ncame forward swiftly with both her hands held out, smiling and\r\nhappy-faced, and looking very kindly on him, and she took his hands and\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now welcome, Gold-mane, welcome, Face-of-god! and twice welcome art thou\r\nand threefold.  Lo! this is the day that thou asked for: art thou happy\r\nin it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe lifted her hands to his lips and kissed them timorously, but said\r\nnought; and therewithal Sure-foot came running forth from the Hall, and\r\nfell to bounding round about them, barking noisily after the manner of\r\ndogs who have met their masters again; and still she held his hands and\r\nbeheld him kindly.  Then she called the hound to her, and patted him on\r\nthe neck and quieted him, and then turned to Face-of-god and laughed\r\nhappily and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not bid thee hold thy peace; yet thou sayest nought.  Is well with\r\nthee?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and more than well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou seemest to me a goodly warrior,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98hast thou met any\r\nfoemen yesterday or this morning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98none hindered me; thou hast made the ways easy to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said soberly, \xe2\x80\x98Such as I might do, I did.  But we may not wield\r\neverything, for our foes are many, and I feared for thee.  But come thou\r\ninto our house, which is ours, and far more ours than the booth before\r\nthe pine-wood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took his hand again and led him toward the door, but Face-of-god\r\nlooked up, and above the lintel he saw carved on the dark stone that\r\nimage of the Wolf, even as he had seen it carved on Wood-grey\xe2\x80\x99s tie-beam;\r\nand therewith such thoughts came into his mind that he stopped to look,\r\npressing the Friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand hard as though bidding her note it.  The stone\r\nwherein the image was carved was darker than the other building stones,\r\nand might be called black; the jaws of the wood-beast were open and\r\ngaping, and had been painted with cinnabar, but wind and weather had worn\r\naway the most of the colour.\r\n\r\nSpake the Friend: \xe2\x80\x98So it is: thou beholdest the token of the God and\r\nFather of out Fathers, that telleth the tale of so many days, that the\r\ndays which now pass by us be to them but as the drop in the sea of\r\nwaters.  Thou beholdest the sign of our sorrow, the memory of our wrong;\r\nyet is it also the token of our hope.  Maybe it shall lead thee far.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whither?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.  But she answered not a great while, and he looked at\r\nher as she stood a-gazing on the image, and saw how the tears stole out\r\nof her eyes and ran adown her cheeks.  Then again came the thought to him\r\nof Wood-grey\xe2\x80\x99s hall, and the women of the kindred standing before the\r\nWolf and singing of him; and though there was little comeliness in them\r\nand she was so exceeding beauteous, he could not but deem that they were\r\nakin to her.\r\n\r\nBut after a while she wiped the tears from her face and turned to him and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98My friend, the Wolf shall lead thee no-whither but where I also\r\nshall be, whatsoever peril or grief may beset the road or lurk at the\r\nending thereof.  Thou shalt be no thrall, to labour while I look on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis heart swelled within him as she spoke, and he was at point to beseech\r\nher love that moment; but now her face had grown gay and bright again,\r\nand she said while he was gathering words to speak withal:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in, Gold-mane, come into our house; for I have many things to say\r\nto thee.  And moreover thou art so hushed, and so fearsome in thy mail,\r\nthat I think thou yet deemest me to be a Wight of the Waste, such as\r\nStone-face thy Fosterer told thee tales of, and forewarned thee.  So\r\nwould I eat before thee, and sign the meat with the sign of the\r\nEarth-god\xe2\x80\x99s Hammer, to show thee that he is in error concerning me, and\r\nthat I am a very woman flesh and fell, as my kindred were before me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed and was exceeding glad, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Tell me now, kind friend,\r\ndost thou deem that Stone-face\xe2\x80\x99s tales are mere mockery of his dreams,\r\nand that he is beguiled by empty semblances or less?  Or are there such\r\nWights in the Waste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98the man is a true man; and of these things are there\r\nmany ancient tales which we may not doubt.  Yet so it is that such wights\r\nhave I never yet seen, nor aught to scare me save evil men: belike it is\r\nthat I have been over-much busied in dealing with sorrow and ruin to look\r\nafter them: or it may be that they feared me and the wrath-breeding grief\r\nof the kindred.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at her earnestly, and the wisdom of her heart seemed to enter\r\ninto his; but she said: \xe2\x80\x98It is of men we must talk, and of me and thee.\r\nCome with me, my friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she stepped lightly over the threshold and drew him in.  The Hall was\r\nstern and grim and somewhat dusky, for its windows were but small: it was\r\nall of stone, both walls and roof.  There was no timber-work therein save\r\nthe benches and chairs, a little about the doors at the lower end that\r\nled to the buttery and out-bowers; and this seemed to have been wrought\r\nof late years; yea, the chairs against the gable on the da\xc3\xafs were of\r\nstone built into the wall, adorned with carving somewhat sparingly, the\r\nimage of the Wolf being done over the midmost of them.  He looked up and\r\ndown the Hall, and deemed it some seventy feet over all from end to end;\r\nand he could see in the dimness those same goodly hangings on the wall\r\nwhich he had seen in the woodland booth.\r\n\r\nShe led him up to the da\xc3\xafs, and stood there leaning up against the arm of\r\none of those stone seats silent for a while; then she turned and looked\r\nat him, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, thou lookest a goodly warrior; yet am I glad that thou camest\r\nhither without battle.  Tell me, Gold-mane,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, taking one of his\r\nspears from his hand, \xe2\x80\x98art thou deft with the spear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been called so,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him sweetly and said: \xe2\x80\x98Canst thou show me the feat of\r\nspear-throwing in this Hall, or shall we wend outside presently that I\r\nmay see thee throw?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Hall sufficeth,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.  \xe2\x80\x98Shall I set this steel in the lintel of\r\nthe buttery door yonder?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, if thou canst,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nHe smiled and took the spear from her, and poised it and shook it till it\r\nquivered again, then suddenly drew back his arm and cast, and the shaft\r\nsped whistling down the dim hall, and smote the aforesaid door-lintel and\r\nstuck there quivering: then he sprang down from the da\xc3\xafs, and ran down\r\nthe hall, and put forth his hand and pulled it forth from the wood, and\r\nwas on the da\xc3\xafs again in a trice, and cast again, and the second time set\r\nthe spear in the same place, and then took his other spear from the board\r\nand cast it, and there stood the two staves in the wood side by side;\r\nthen he went soberly down the hall and drew them both out of the wood and\r\ncame back to her, while she stood watching him, her cheek flushed, her\r\nlips a little parted.\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Good spear-casting, forsooth! and far above what our folk can\r\ndo, who be no great throwers of the spear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGold-mane laughed: \xe2\x80\x98Sooth is that,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98or hardly were I here to\r\nteach thee spear-throwing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wilt thou _never_ be paid for that simple onslaught?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I been paid then?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nShe reddened, for she remembered her word to him on the mountain; and he\r\nput his hand on her shoulder and kissed her cheek, but timorously; nor\r\ndid she withstand him or shrink aback, but said soberly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good indeed is thy spear-throwing, and meseems my brother will love thee\r\nwhen he hath seen thee strike a stroke or two in wrath.  But, fair\r\nwarrior, there be no foemen here: so get thee to the lower end of the\r\nHall, and in the bower beyond shalt thou find fresh water; there wash the\r\nwaste from off thee, and do off thine helm and hauberk, and come back\r\nspeedily and eat with me; for I hunger, and so dost thou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did as she bade him, and came back presently bearing in his hand both\r\nhelm and hauberk, and he looked light-limbed and trim and lissome, an\r\nexceeding goodly man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.  THE FAIR WOMAN TELLETH FACE-OF-GOD OF HER KINDRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN he came back to the da\xc3\xafs he saw that there was meat upon the board,\r\nand the Friend said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now art thou Gold-mane indeed: but come now, sit by me and eat, though\r\nthe Wood-woman giveth thee but a sorry banquet, O guest; but from the\r\nDale it is, and we be too far now from the dwellings of men to have\r\ndelicate meat on the board, though to-night when they come back thy cheer\r\nshall be better.  Yet even then thou shalt have no such dainties as\r\nStone-face hath imagined for thee at the hands of the Wood-wight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laughed therewith, and he no less; and in sooth the meat was but\r\nsimple, of curds and new cheese, meat of the herdsmen.  But Face-of-god\r\nsaid gaily: \xe2\x80\x98Sweet it shall be to me; good is all that the Friend\r\ngiveth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she raised her hand and made the sign of the Hammer over the board,\r\nand looked up at him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hath the Earth-god changed my face, Gold-mane, to what I verily am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe held his face close to hers and looked into it, and him-seemed it was\r\nas pure as the waters of a mountain lake, and as fine and well-wrought\r\nevery deal of it as when his father had wrought in his stithy many days\r\nand fashioned a small piece of great mastery.  He was ashamed to kiss her\r\nagain, but he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98This is the fairest woman of the world,\r\nwhom I have sworn to wed this year.\xe2\x80\x99  Then he spake aloud and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see the face of the Friend, and it will not change to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain she reddened a little, and the happy look in her face seemed to\r\ngrow yet sweeter, and he was bewildered with longing and delight.\r\n\r\nBut she stood up and went to an ambrye in the wall and brought forth a\r\nhorn shod and lipped with silver of ancient fashion, and she poured wine\r\ninto it and held it forth and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O guest from the Dale, I pledge thee! and when thou hast drunk to me in\r\nturn we will talk of weighty matters.  For indeed I bear hopes in my\r\nhands too heavy for the daughters of men to bear; and thou art a\r\nchieftain\xe2\x80\x99s son, and mayst well help me to bear them; so let us talk\r\nsimply and without guile, as folk that trust one another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo she drank and held out the horn to him, and he took the horn and her\r\nhand both, and he kissed her hand and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here in this Hall I drink to the Sons of the Wolf, whosoever they be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTherewith he drank and he said: \xe2\x80\x98Simply and guilelessly indeed will I\r\ntalk with thee; for I am weary of lies, and for thy sake have I told a\r\nmany.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou shalt tell no more,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98and as for the health thou hast\r\ndrunk, it is good, and shall profit thee.  Now sit we here in these\r\nancient seats and let us talk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they sat them down while the sun was westering in the March afternoon,\r\nand she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me first what tidings have been in the Dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he told her of the ransackings and of the murder at Carlstead.\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98These tidings have we heard before, and some deal of them we\r\nknow better than ye do, or can; for we were the ransackers of Penny-thumb\r\nand Harts-bane.  Thereof will I say more presently.  What other tidings\r\nhast thou to tell of?  What oaths were sworn upon the Boar last Yule?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he told her of the oath of Bristler the son of Brightling.  She smiled\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98He shall keep his oath, and yet redden no blade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he told of his father\xe2\x80\x99s oath, and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is good; but even so would he do and no oath sworn.  All men may\r\ntrust Iron-face.  And thou, my friend, what oath didst thou swear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis face grew somewhat troubled as he said: \xe2\x80\x98I swore to wed the fairest\r\nwoman in the world, though the Dalesmen gainsaid me, and they beyond the\r\nDale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and there is no need to ask thee whom thou didst mean\r\nby thy \xe2\x80\x9cfairest woman,\xe2\x80\x9d for I have seen that thou deemest me fair enough.\r\nMy friend, maybe thy kindred will be against it, and the kindred of the\r\nBride; and it might be that my kindred would have gainsaid it if things\r\nwere not as they are.  But though all men gainsay it, yet will not I.  It\r\nis meet and right that we twain wed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe spake very soberly and quietly, but when she had spoken there was\r\nnothing in his heart but joy and gladness: yet shame of her loveliness\r\nrefrained him, and he cast down his eyes before hers.  Then she said in a\r\nkind voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know thee, how glad thou art of this word of mine, because thou\r\nlookest on me with eyes of love, and thinkest of me as better than I am;\r\nthough I am no ill woman and no beguiler.  But this is not all that I\r\nhave to say to thee, though it be much; for there are more folk in the\r\nworld than thou and I only.  But I told thee this first, that thou\r\nmightest trust me in all things.  So, my friend, if thou canst, refrain\r\nthy joy and thy longing a little, and hearken to what concerneth thee and\r\nme, and thy people and mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fair woman and sweet friend,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98thou knowest of a gladness which\r\nis hard to bear if one must lay it aside for a while; and of a longing\r\nwhich is hard to refrain if it mingle with another longing\xe2\x80\x94knowest thou\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98I will forbear as thou biddest me.  Tell me,\r\nthen, what were the felons who were slain at Carlstead?  Knowest thou of\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Over well,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98they are our foes this many a year; and since we\r\nmet last autumn they have become foes of you Dalesmen also.  Soon shall\r\nye have tidings of them; and it was against them that I bade thee arm\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Is it against them that thou wouldst have us do battle\r\nalong with thy folk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98no other foemen have we.  And now, Gold-mane, thou\r\nart become a friend of the Wolf, and shalt before long be of affinity\r\nwith our House; that other day thou didst ask me to tell thee of me and\r\nmine, and now will I do according to thine asking.  Short shall my tale\r\nbe; because maybe thou shalt hear it told again, and in goodly wise,\r\nbefore thine whole folk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As thou wottest we be now outlaws and Wolves\xe2\x80\x99 Heads; and whiles we lift\r\nthe gear of men, but ever if we may of ill men and not of good; there is\r\nno worthy goodman of the Dale from whom we would take one hoof, or a skin\r\nof wine, or a cake of wax.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wherefore are we outlaws?  Because we have been driven from our own, and\r\nwe bore away our lives and our weapons, and little else; and for our\r\nlands, thou seest this Vale in the howling wilderness and how narrow and\r\npoor it is, though it hath been the nurse of warriors in time past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hearken!  Time long ago came the kindred of the Wolf to these Mountains\r\nof the World; and they were in a pass in the stony maze and the utter\r\nwilderness of the Mountains, and the foe was behind them in numbers not\r\nto be borne up against.  And so it befell that the pass forked, and there\r\nwere two ways before our Folk; and one part of them would take the way to\r\nthe north and the other the way to the south; and they could not agree\r\nwhich way the whole Folk should take.  So they sundered into two\r\ncompanies, and one took one way and one another.  Now as to those who\r\nfared by the southern road, we knew not what befell them, nor for long\r\nand long had we any tale of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we who took the northern road, we happened on this Vale amidst the\r\nwilderness, and we were weary of fleeing from the over-mastering foe; and\r\nthe dale seemed enough, and a refuge, and a place to dwell in, and no man\r\nwas there before us, and few were like to find it, and we were but a few.\r\nSo we dwelt here in this Vale for as wild as it is, the place where the\r\nsun shineth never in the winter, and scant is the summer sunshine\r\ntherein.  Here we raised a Doom-ring and builded us a Hall, wherein thou\r\nnow sittest beside me, O friend, and we dwelt here many seasons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We had a few sheep in the wilderness, and a few neat fed down the grass\r\nof the Vale; and we found gems and copper in the rocks about us wherewith\r\nat whiles to chaffer with the aliens, and fish we drew from our river the\r\nShivering Flood.  Also it is not to be hidden that in those days we did\r\nnot spare to lift the goods of men; yea, whiles would our warriors fare\r\ndown unto the edges of the Plain and lie in wait there till the time\r\nserved, and then drive the spoil from under the very walls of the Cities.\r\nOur men were not little-hearted, nor did our women lament the death of\r\nwarriors over-much, for they were there to bear more warriors to the\r\nFolk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But the seasons passed, and the Folk multiplied in Shadowy Vale, and\r\nlivelihood seemed like to fail them, and needs must they seek wider\r\nlands.  So by ways which thou wilt one day wot of, we came into a valley\r\nthat lieth north-west of Shadowy Vale: a land like thine of Burgdale, or\r\nbetter; wide it was, plenteous of grass and trees, well watered, full of\r\nall things that man can desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were there men before us in this Dale? sayest thou.  Yea, but not very\r\nmany, and they feeble in battle, weak of heart, though strong of body.\r\nThese, when they saw the Sons of the Wolf with weapons in their hands,\r\nfelt themselves puny before us, and their hearts failed them; and they\r\ncame to us with gifts, and offered to share the Dale between them and us,\r\nfor they said there was enough for both folks.  So we took their offer\r\nand became their friends; and some of our Houses wedded wives of the\r\nstrangers, and gave them their women to wife.  Therein they did amiss;\r\nfor the blended Folk as the generations passed became softer than our\r\nblood, and many were untrusty and greedy and tyrannous, and the days of\r\nthe whoredom fell upon us, and when we deemed ourselves the mightiest\r\nthen were we the nearest to our fall.  But the House whereof I am would\r\nnever wed with these Westlanders, and other Houses there were who had\r\naffinity with us who chiefly wedded with us of the Wolf, and their\r\nfathers had come with ours into that fruitful Dale; and these were called\r\nthe Red Hand, and the Silver Arm, and the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged\r\nSword.  Thou hast heard those names once before, friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and as he spoke the picture of that other day came back\r\nto him, and he called to mind all that he had said, and his happiness of\r\nthat hour seemed the more and the sweeter for that memory.\r\n\r\nShe went on: \xe2\x80\x98Fair and goodly is that Dale as mine own eyes have seen,\r\nand plentiful of all things, and up in its mountains to the east are\r\ncaves and pits whence silver is digged abundantly; therefore is the Dale\r\ncalled Silver-dale.  Hast thou heard thereof, my friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98though I have marvelled whence ye gat such\r\nfoison of silver.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked on her and marvelled, for now she seemed as if it were another\r\nwoman: her eyes were gleaming bright, her lips were parted; there was a\r\nbright red flush on the pommels of her two cheeks as she spake again and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Happy lived the Folk in Silver-dale for many and many winters and\r\nsummers: the seasons were good and no lack was there: little sickness\r\nthere was and less war, and all seemed better than well.  It is strange\r\nthat ye Dalesmen have not heard of Silver-dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but I have not; of Rose-dale have I heard, as a land\r\nvery far away: but no further do we know of toward that a\xc3\xadrt.  Lieth\r\nSilver-dale anywhere nigh to Rose-dale?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98It is the next dale to it, yet is it a far journey betwixt the\r\ntwo, for the ice-sea pusheth a horn in betwixt them; and even below the\r\nice the mountain-neck is passable to none save a bold crag-climber, and\r\nto him only bearing his life in his hands.  But, my friend, I am but\r\nlingering over my tale, because it grieveth me sore to have to tell it.\r\nHearken then!  In the days when I had seen but ten summers, and my\r\nbrother was a very young man, but exceeding strong, and as beautiful as\r\nthou art now, war fell on us without rumour or warning; for there swarmed\r\ninto Silver-dale, though not by the ways whereby we had entered it, a\r\nhost of aliens, short of stature, crooked of limb, foul of aspect, but\r\nfierce warriors and armed full well: they were men having no country to\r\ngo back to, though they had no women or children with them, as we had\r\nwhen we were young in these lands, but used all women whom they took as\r\ntheir beastly lust bade them, making them their thralls if they slew them\r\nnot.  Soon we found that these foemen asked no more of us than all we\r\nhad, and therewithal our lives to be cast away or used for their service\r\nas beasts of burden or pleasure.  There then we gathered our fighting-men\r\nand withstood them; and if we had been all of the kindreds of the Wolf\r\nand the fruit of the wives of warriors, we should have driven back these\r\nfelons and saved the Dale, though it maybe more than half ruined: but the\r\nmost part of us were of that mingled blood, or of the generations of the\r\nDalesmen whom we had conquered long ago, and stout as they were of body\r\ntheir hearts failed them, and they gave themselves up to the aliens to be\r\nas their oxen and asses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why make a long tale of it?  We who were left, and could brook death but\r\nnot thraldom, fought it out together, women as well as men, till the\r\nsweetness of life and a happy chance for escape bid us flee, vanquished\r\nbut free men.  For at the end of three days\xe2\x80\x99 fight we had been driven up\r\nto the easternmost end of the Dale, and up anigh to the jaws of the pass\r\nwhereby the Folk had first come into Silver-dale, and we had those with\r\nus who knew every cranny of that way, while to strangers who knew it not\r\nit was utterly impassable; night was coming on also, and even those\r\nmurder-carles were weary with slaying; and, moreover, on this last day,\r\nwhen they saw that they had won all, they were fighting to keep, and not\r\nto slay, and a few stubborn carles and queens, of what use would they be,\r\nor where was the gain of risking life to win them?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So they forbore us, and night came on moonless and dark; and it was the\r\nearly spring season, when the days are not yet long, and so by night and\r\ncloud we fled away, and back again to Shadowy Vale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forsooth, we were but a few; for when we were gotten into this Vale,\r\nthis strip of grass and water in the wilderness, and had told up our\r\ncompany, we were but two hundred and thirty and five of men and women and\r\nchildren.  For there were an hundred and thirty and three grown men of\r\nall ages, and of women grown seventy and five, and one score and seven\r\nchildren, whereof I was one; for, as thou mayst deem, it was easier for\r\ngrown men with weapons in their hands to escape from that slaughter than\r\nfor women and children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There sat we in yonder Doom-ring and took counsel, and to some it seemed\r\ngood that we should all dwell together in Shadowy Vale, and beset the\r\nskirts of the foemen till the days should better; but others deemed that\r\nthere was little avail therein; and there was a mighty man of the\r\nkindred, Stone-wolf by name, a man of middle-age, and he said, that late\r\nin life had he tasted of war, and though the banquet was made bitter with\r\ndefeat, yet did the meat seem wholesome to him.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome down with me to\r\nthe Cities of the Plain,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9call you who are stout warriors; and\r\nleave we here the old men and the swains and the women and children.\r\nHateful are the folk there, and full of malice, but soft withal and\r\ndastardly.  Let us go down thither and make ourselves strong amongst\r\nthem, and sell our valour for their wealth till we come to rule them, and\r\nthey make us their kings, and we establish the Folk of the Wolf amongst\r\nthe aliens; then will we come back hither and bring away that which we\r\nhave left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So he spake, and the more part of the warriors yea said his rede, and\r\nthey went with him to the Westland, and amongst these was my brother\r\nFolk-might (for that is his name in the kindred).  And I sorrowed at his\r\ndeparture, for he had borne me thither out of the flames and the clash of\r\nswords and the press of battle, and to me had he ever been kind and\r\nloving, albeit he hath had the Words of hard and froward used on him full\r\noft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So in this Vale abode we that were left, and the seasons passed; some of\r\nthe elders died, and some of the children also; but more children were\r\nborn, for amongst us were men and women to whom it was lawful to wed with\r\neach other.  Even with this scanty remnant was left some of the life of\r\nthe kindred of old days; and after we had been here but a little while,\r\nthe young men, yea and the old also, and even some of the women, would\r\nsteal through passes that we, and we only, knew of, and would fall upon\r\nthe Aliens in Silver-dale as occasion served, and lift their goods both\r\nlive and dead; and this became both a craft and a pastime amongst us.\r\nNor may I hide that we sometimes went lifting otherwhere; for in the\r\nsummer and autumn we would fare west a little and abide in the woods the\r\nseason through, and hunt the deer thereof, and whiles would we drive the\r\nspoil from the scattered folk not far from your Shepherd-Folk; but with\r\nthe Shepherds themselves and with you Dalesmen we meddled not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now that little wood-lawn with the toft of an ancient dwelling in it,\r\nwherein, saith Bow-may, thou didst once rest, was one of our summer\r\nabodes; and later on we built the hall under the pine-wood that thou\r\nknowest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thus then grew up our young men; and our maids were little softer; e\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nsuch as Bow-may is (and kind is she withal), and it seemed in very sooth\r\nas if the Spirit of the Wolf was with us, and the roughness of the Waste\r\nmade us fierce; and law we had not and heeded not, though love was\r\namongst us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe stopped awhile and fell a-musing, and her face softened, and she\r\nturned to him with that sweet happy look upon it and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Desolate and dreary is the Dale, thou deemest, friend; and yet for me I\r\nlove it and its dark-green water, and it is to me as if the Fathers of\r\nthe kindred visit it and hold converse with us; and there I grew up when\r\nI was little, before I knew what a woman was, and strange communings had\r\nI with the wilderness.  Friend, when we are wedded, and thou art a great\r\nchieftain, as thou wilt be, I shall ask of thee the boon to suffer me to\r\nabide here at whiles that I may remember the days when I was little and\r\nthe love of the kindred waxed in me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is but a little thing to ask,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; \xe2\x80\x98I would thou\r\nhadst asked me more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fear not,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I shall ask thee for much and many things; and\r\nsome of them belike thou shalt deny me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe shook his head; but she smiled in his face and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, so it is, friend; but hearken.  The seasons passed, and six years\r\nwore, and I was grown a tall slim maiden, fleet of foot and able to\r\nendure toil enough, though I never bore weapons, nor have done.  So on a\r\nfair even of midsummer when we were together, the most of us, round about\r\nthis Hall and the Doom-ring, we saw a tall man in bright war-gear come\r\nforth into the Dale by the path that thou camest, and then another and\r\nanother till there were two score and seven men-at-arms standing on the\r\ngrass below the scree yonder; by that time had we gotten some weapons in\r\nour hands, and we stood together to meet the new-comers, but they drew no\r\nsword and notched no shaft, but came towards us laughing and joyous, and\r\nlo! it was my brother Folk-might and his men, those that were left of\r\nthem, come back to us from the Westland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad indeed was I to behold him; and for him when he had taken me in his\r\narms and looked up and down the Dale, he cried out: \xe2\x80\x98In many fair places\r\nand many rich dwellings have I been; but this is the hour that I have\r\nlooked for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now when we asked him concerning Stone-wolf and the others who were\r\nmissing (for ten tens of stalwarth men had fared to the Westland), he\r\nswept out his hand toward the west and said with a solemn face: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nthey lie, and grass groweth over their bones, and we who have come aback,\r\nand ye who have abided, these are now the children of the Wolf: there are\r\nno more now on the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let be!  It was a fair even and high was the feast in the Hall that\r\nnight, and sweet was the converse with our folk come back.  A glad man\r\nwas my brother Folk-might when he heard that for years past we had been\r\nlifting the gear of men, and chiefly of the Aliens in Silver-dale: and he\r\nhimself was become learned in war and a deft leader of men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So the days passed and the seasons, and we lived on as we might; but\r\nwith Folk-might\xe2\x80\x99s return there began to grow up in all our hearts what\r\nhad long been flourishing in mine, and that was the hope of one day\r\nwinning back our own again, and dying amidst the dear groves of\r\nSilver-dale.  Within these years we had increased somewhat in number; for\r\nif we had lost those warriors in the Westland, and some old men who had\r\ndied in the Dale, yet our children had grown up (I have now seen twenty\r\nand one summers) and more were growing up.  Moreover, after the first\r\nyear, from the time when we began to fall upon the Dusky Men of\r\nSilver-dale, from time to time they who went on such adventures set free\r\nsuch thralls of our blood as they could fall in with and whom they could\r\ntrust in, and they dwelt (and yet dwell) with us in the Dale: first and\r\nlast we have taken in three score and twelve of such men, and a score of\r\nwomen-thralls withal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now during these seasons, and not very long ago, after I was a woman\r\ngrown, the thought came to me, and to Folk-might also, that there were\r\nkindreds of the people dwelling anear us whom we might so deal with that\r\nthey should become our friends and brothers in arms, and that through\r\nthem we might win back Silver-dale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of Rose-dale we wotted already that the Folk were nought of our blood,\r\nfeeble in the field, cowed by the Dusky Men, and at last made thralls to\r\nthem; so nought was to do there.  But Folk-might went to and fro to\r\ngather tidings: at whiles I with him, at whiles one or more of\r\nWood-father\xe2\x80\x99s children, who with their father and mother and Bow-may have\r\nabided in the Vale ever since the Great Undoing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Soon he fell in with thy Folk, and first of all with the Woodlanders,\r\nand that was a joy to him; for wot ye what?  He got to know that these\r\nmen were the children of those of our Folk who had sundered from us in\r\nthe mountain passes time long and long ago; and he loved them, for he saw\r\nthat they were hardy and trusty, and warriors at heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he went amongst the Shepherd-Folk, and he deemed them good men\r\neasily stirred, and deemed that they might soon be won to friendship; and\r\nhe knew that they were mostly come from the Houses of the Woodlanders, so\r\nthat they also were of the kindred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And last he came into Burgdale, and found there a merry and happy Folk,\r\nlittle wont to war, but stout-hearted, and nowise puny either of body or\r\nsoul; he went there often and learned much about them, and deemed that\r\nthey would not be hard to win to fellowship.  And he found that the House\r\nof the Face was the chiefest house there; and that the Alderman and his\r\nsons were well beloved of all the folk, and that they were the men to be\r\nwon first, since through them should all others be won.  I also went to\r\nBurgstead with him twice, as I told thee erst; and I saw thee, and I\r\ndeemed that thou wouldest lightly become our friend; and it came into my\r\nmind that I myself might wed thee, and that the House of the Face thereby\r\nmight have affinity thenceforth with the Children of the Wolf.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Why didst thou deem thus of me, O friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98Dost thou long to hear me say the words when thou\r\nknowest my thought well?  So be it.  I saw thee both young and fair; and\r\nI knew thee to be the son of a noble, worthy, guileless man and of a\r\nbeauteous woman of great wits and good rede.  And I found thee to be kind\r\nand open-handed and simple like thy father, and like thy mother wiser\r\nthan thou thyself knew of thyself; and that thou wert desirous of deeds\r\nand fain of women.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a while, and he also: then he said: \xe2\x80\x98Didst thou draw\r\nme to the woods and to thee?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe reddened and said: \xe2\x80\x98I am no spell-wife: but true it is that\r\nWood-mother made a waxen image of thee, and thrust through the heart\r\nthereof the pin of my girdle-buckle, and stroked it every morning with an\r\noak-bough over which she had sung spells.  But dost thou not remember,\r\nGold-mane, how that one day last Hay-month, as ye were resting in the\r\nmeadows in the cool of the evening, there came to you a minstrel that\r\nplayed to you on the fiddle, and therewith sang a song that melted all\r\nyour hearts, and that this song told of the Wild-wood, and what was\r\ntherein of desire and peril and beguiling and death, and love unto Death\r\nitself?  Dost thou remember, friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and how when the minstrel was done Stone-face fell to\r\ntelling us more tales yet of the woodland, and the minstrel sang again\r\nand yet again, till his tales had entered into my very heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and that minstrel was Wood-wont; and I sent him to sing\r\nto thee and thine, deeming that if thou didst hearken, thou would\xe2\x80\x99st seek\r\nthe woodland and happen upon us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou didst not doubt but that if we met, thou\r\nmightest do with me as thou wouldest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that I doubted it little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Therein wert thou wise,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; \xe2\x80\x98but now that we are talking\r\nwithout guile to each other, mightest thou tell me wherefore it was that\r\nFolk-might made that onslaught upon me?  For certain it is that he was\r\nminded to slay me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98It was sooth what I told thee, that whiles he groweth so\r\nbattle-eager that whatso edge-tool he beareth must needs come out of the\r\nscabbard; but there was more in it than that, which I could not tell thee\r\nerst.  Two days before thy coming he had been down to Burgstead in the\r\nguise of an old carle such as thou sawest him with me in the\r\nmarket-place.  There was he guested in your Hall, and once more saw thee\r\nand the Bride together; and he saw the eyes of love wherewith she looked\r\non thee (for so much he told me), and deemed that thou didst take her\r\nlove but lightly.  And he himself looked on her with such love (and this\r\nhe told me not) that he deemed nought good enough for her, and would have\r\nhad thee give thyself up wholly to her; for my brother is a generous man,\r\nmy friend.  So when I told him on the morn of that day whereon we met\r\nthat we looked to see thee that eve (for indeed I am somewhat\r\nforeseeing), he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook thou, Sun-beam, if he cometh, it is not\r\nunlike that I shall drive a spear through him.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWherefore?\xe2\x80\x9d said I;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccan he serve our turn when he is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d  Said he: \xe2\x80\x9cI care little.  Mine\r\nown turn will I serve.  Thou sayest _Wherefore_?  I tell thee this\r\nstripling beguileth to her torment the fairest woman that is in the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94such an one as is meet to be the mother of chieftains, and to stand\r\nby warriors in their day of peril.  I have seen her; and thus have I seen\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d  Then said I: \xe2\x80\x9cGreatly forsooth shalt thou pleasure her by slaying\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d  And he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall pleasure myself.  And one day she shall\r\nthank me, when she taketh my hand in hers and we go together to the\r\nBride-bed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Therewith came over me a clear foresight of the hours to\r\ncome, and I said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYea, Folk-might, cast the spear and draw the\r\nsword; but him thou shalt not slay: and thou shalt one day see him\r\nstanding with us before the shafts of the Dusky Men.\xe2\x80\x9d  So I spake; but he\r\nlooked fiercely at me, and departed and shunned me all that day, and by\r\ngood hap I was hard at hand when thou drewest nigh our abode.  Nay,\r\nGold-mane, what would\xe2\x80\x99st thou with thy sword?  Why art thou so red and\r\nwrathful?  Would\xe2\x80\x99st thou fight with my brother because he loveth thy\r\nfriend, thine old playmate, thy kinswoman, and thinketh pity of her\r\nsorrow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said, with knit brow and gleaming eyes: \xe2\x80\x98Would the man take her away\r\nfrom me perforce?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98thou art not yet so wise as not to be a fool at\r\nwhiles.  Is it not so that she herself hath taken herself from thee,\r\nsince she hath come to know that thou hast given thyself to another?\r\nHath she noted nought of thee this winter and spring?  Is she well\r\npleased with the ways of thee?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou hast spoken simply with me, and I will do no less with\r\nthee.  It was but four days agone that she did me to wit that she knew of\r\nme how I sought my love on the Mountain; and she put me to sore shame,\r\nand afterwards I wept for her sorrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he told her all that the Bride had said to him, as he well\r\nmight, for he had forgotten no word of it.\r\n\r\nThen said the Friend: \xe2\x80\x98She shall have the token that she craveth, and it\r\nis I that shall give it to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she took from her finger a ring wherein was set a very fair\r\nchangeful mountain-stone, and gave it to him, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou shalt give her this and tell her whence thou hadst it; and tell her\r\nthat I bid her remember that To-morrow is a new day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.  THOSE TWO TOGETHER HOLD THE RING OF THE EARTH-GOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAND now they fell silent both of them, and sat hearkening the sounds of\r\nthe Dale, from the whistle of the plover down by the water-side to the\r\nfar-off voices of the children and maidens about the kine in the lower\r\nmeadows.  At last Gold-mane took up the word and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sweet friend, tell me the uttermost of what thou would\xe2\x80\x99st have of me.\r\nIs it not that I should stand by thee and thine in the Folk-mote of the\r\nDalesmen, and speak for you when ye pray us for help against your foemen;\r\nand then again that I do my best when ye and we are arrayed for battle\r\nagainst the Dusky Men?  This is easy to do, and great is the reward thou\r\nofferest me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I look for this service of thee,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and none other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when I go down to the battle,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98shalt thou be sorry for our\r\nsundering?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98There shall be no sundering; I shall wend with thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid he: \xe2\x80\x98And if I were slain in the battle, would\xe2\x80\x99st thou lament me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou shalt not be slain,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nAgain was there silence betwixt them, till at last he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This then is why thou didst draw me to thee in the Wild-wood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\nAgain for a while no word was spoken, and Face-of-god looked on her till\r\nshe cast her eyes down before him.\r\n\r\nThen at last he spake, and the colour came and went in his face as he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Tell me thy name what it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98I am called the Sun-beam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he said, and his voice trembled therewith: \xe2\x80\x98O Sun-beam, I have been\r\nseeking pleasant and cunning words, and can find none such.  But tell me\r\nthis if thou wilt: dost thou desire me as I desire thee? or is it that\r\nthou wilt suffer me to wed thee and bed thee at last as mere payment for\r\nthe help that I shall give to thee and thine?  Nay, doubt it not that I\r\nwill take the payment, if this is what thou wilt give me and nought else.\r\nYet tell me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer face grew troubled, and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, maybe that thou hast now asked me one question too many; for\r\nthis is no fair game to be played between us.  For thee, as I deem, there\r\nare this day but two people in the world, and that is thou and I, and the\r\nearth is for us two alone.  But, my friend, though I have seen but twenty\r\nand one summers, it is nowise so with me, and to me there are many in the\r\nworld; and chiefly the Folk of the Wolf, amidst whose very heart I have\r\ngrown up.  Moreover, I can think of her whom I have supplanted, the Bride\r\nto wit; and I know her, and how bitter and empty her days shall be for a\r\nwhile, and how vain all our redes for her shall seem to her.  Yea, I know\r\nher sorrow, and see it and grieve for it: so canst not thou, unless thou\r\nverily see her before thee, her face unhappy, and her voice changed and\r\nhard.  Well, I will tell thee what thou askest.  When I drew thee to me\r\non the Mountain I thought but of the friendship and brotherhood to be\r\nknitted up between our two Folks, nor did I anywise desire thy love of a\r\nyoung man.  But when I saw thee on the heath and in the Hall that day, it\r\npleased me to think that a man so fair and chieftain-like should one day\r\nlie by my side; and again when I saw that the love of me had taken hold\r\nof thee, I would not have thee grieved because of me, but would have thee\r\nhappy.  And now what shall I say?\xe2\x80\x94I know not; I cannot tell.  Yet am I\r\nthe Friend, as erst I called myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, Gold-mane, I have seen hitherto but the outward show and image of\r\nthee, and though that be goodly, how would it be if thou didst shame me\r\nwith little-heartedness and evil deeds?  Let me see thee in the Folk-mote\r\nand the battle, and then may I answer thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she held her peace, and he answered nothing; and she turned her face\r\nfrom him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Out on it! have I beguiled myself as well as thee?  These are but empty\r\nwords I have been saying.  If thou wilt drag the truth out of me, this is\r\nthe very truth: that to-day is happy to me as it is to thee, and that I\r\nhave longed sore for its coming.  O Gold-mane, O speech-friend, if thou\r\nwert to pray me or command me that I lie in thine arms to-night, I should\r\nknow not how to gainsay thee.  Yet I beseech thee to forbear, lest thy\r\ndeath and mine come of it.  And why should we die, O friend, when we are\r\nso young, and the world lies so fair before us, and the happy days are at\r\nhand when the Children of the Wolf and the kindreds of the Dale shall\r\ndeliver the Folk, and all days shall be good and all years?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey had both risen up as she spake, and now he put forth his hands to\r\nher and took her in his arms, wondering the while, as he drew her to him,\r\nhow much slenderer and smaller and weaker she seemed in his embrace than\r\nhe had thought of her; and when their lips met, he felt that she kissed\r\nhim as he her.  Then he held her by the shoulders at arms\xe2\x80\x99 length from\r\nhim, and beheld her face how her eyes were closed and her lips quivering.\r\nBut before him, in a moment of time, passed a picture of the life to be\r\nin the fair Dale, and all she would give him there, and the days good and\r\nlovely from morn to eve and eve to morn; and though in that moment it was\r\nhard for him to speak, at last he spoke in a voice hoarse at first, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou sayest sooth, O friend; we will not die, but live; I will not drag\r\nour deaths upon us both, nor put a sword in the hands of Folk-might, who\r\nloves me not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he kissed her on the brow and said: \xe2\x80\x98Now shalt thou take me by the\r\nhand and lead me forth from the Hall.  For the day is waxing old, and\r\nhere meseemeth in this dim hall there are words crossing in the air about\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94words spoken in days long ago, and tales of old time, that keep egging\r\nme on to do my will and die, because that is all that the world hath for\r\na valiant man; and to such words I would not hearken, for in this hour I\r\nhave no will to die, nor can I think of death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and led him forth without more words, and they went\r\nhand in hand and paced slowly round the Doom-ring, the light air\r\nbreathing upon them till their faces were as calm and quiet as their wont\r\nwas, and hers especially as bright and happy as when he had first seen\r\nher that day.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking now, and only sent one golden ray into the valley\r\nthrough a cleft in the western rock-wall, but the sky overhead was bright\r\nand clear; from the meadows came the sound of the lowing of kine and the\r\nvoices of children a-sporting, and it seemed to Gold-mane that they were\r\ndrawing nigher, both the children and the kine, and somewhat he begrudged\r\nit that he should not be alone with the Friend.\r\n\r\nNow when they had made half the circuit of the Doom-ring, the Sun-beam\r\nstopped him, and then led him through the Ring of Stones, and brought him\r\nup to the altar which was amidst of it; and the altar was a great black\r\nstone hewn smooth and clean, and with the image of the Wolf carven on the\r\nfront thereof; and on its face lay the gold ring which the priest or\r\ncaptain of the Folk bore on his arm between the God and the people at all\r\nfolk-motes.\r\n\r\nSo she said: \xe2\x80\x98This is the altar of the God of Earth, and often hath it\r\nbeen reddened by mighty men; and thereon lieth the Ring of the Sons of\r\nthe Wolf; and now it were well that we swore troth on that ring before my\r\nbrother cometh; for now will he soon be here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Gold-mane took the Ring and thrust his right hand through it, and\r\ntook her right hand in his; so that the Ring lay on both their hands, and\r\ntherewith he spake aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Face-of-god of the House of the Face, and I do thee to wit, O God\r\nof the Earth, that I pledge my troth to this woman, the Sun-beam of the\r\nKindred of the Wolf, to beget my offspring on her, and to live with her,\r\nand to die with her: so help me, thou God of the Earth, and the Warrior\r\nand the God of the Face!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen spake the Sun-beam: \xe2\x80\x98I, the Sun-beam of the Children of the Wolf,\r\npledge my troth to Face-of-god to lie in his bed and to bear his children\r\nand none other\xe2\x80\x99s, and to be his speech-friend till I die: so help me the\r\nWolf and the Warrior and the God of the Earth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen they laid the Ring on the altar again, and they kissed each other\r\nlong and sweetly, and then turned away from the altar and departed from\r\nthe Doom-ring, going hand in hand together down the meadow, and as they\r\nwent, the noise of the kine and the children grew nearer and nearer, and\r\npresently came the whole company of them round a ness of the rock-wall;\r\nthere were some thirty little lads and lasses driving on the milch-kine,\r\nwith half a score of older maids and grown women, one of whom was\r\nBow-may, who was lightly and scantily clad, as one who heeds not the\r\nweather, or deems all months midsummer.\r\n\r\nThe children came running up merrily when they saw the Sun-beam, but\r\nstopped short shyly when they noted the tall fair stranger with her.\r\nThey were all strong and sturdy children, and some very fair, but brown\r\nwith the weather, if not with the sun.  Bow-may came up to Gold-mane and\r\ntook his hand and greeted him kindly and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So here thou art at last in Shadowy Vale; and I hope that thou art\r\ncontent therewith, and as happy as I would wish thee to be.  Well, this\r\nis the first time; and when thou comest the second time it may well be\r\nthat the world shall be growing better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe held the distaff which she bore in her hand (for she had been\r\nspinning) as if it were a spear; her limbs were goodly and shapely, and\r\nshe trod the thick grass of the Vale with a kind of wary firmness, as\r\nthough foemen might be lurking nearby.  The Sun-beam smiled upon her\r\nkindly and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That shall not fail to be, Bow-may: ye have won a new friend to-day.\r\nBut tell me, when dost thou look to see the men here, for I was down by\r\nthe water when they went away yesterday?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They shall come into the Dale a little after sunset,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bow-may.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I abide them, my friend?\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane, turning to the Sun-beam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98for what else art thou come hither? or art thou so\r\npressed to depart from us?  Last time we met thou wert not so hasty to\r\nsunder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey smiled on each other; and Bow-may looked on them and laughed\r\noutright; then a flush showed in her cheeks through the tan of them, and\r\nshe turned toward the children and the other women who were busied about\r\nthe milking of the kine.\r\n\r\nBut those two sat down together on a bank amidst the plain meadow, facing\r\nthe river and the eastern rock-wall, and the Sun-beam said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am fain to speak to thee and to see thine eyes watching me while I\r\nspeak; and now, my friend, I will tell thee something unasked which has\r\nto do with what e\xe2\x80\x99en now thou didst ask me; for I would have thee trust\r\nme wholly, and know me for what I am.  Time was I schemed and planned for\r\nthis day of betrothal; but now I tell thee it has become no longer\r\nneedful for bringing to pass our fellowship in arms with thy people.  Yea\r\nyesterday, ere he went on a hunt, whereof he shall tell thee, Folk-might\r\nwas against it, in words at least; and yet as one who would have it done\r\nif he might have no part in it.  So, in good sooth, this hand that lieth\r\nin thine is the hand of a wilful woman, who desireth a man, and would\r\nkeep him for her speech-friend.  Now art thou fond and happy; yet bear in\r\nmind that there are deeds to be done, and the troth we have just plighted\r\nmust be paid for.  So hearken, I bid thee.  Dost thou care to know why\r\nthe wheedling of thee is no longer needful to us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98A little while ago I should have said, Yea, If thy lips say the\r\nwords.  But now, O friend, it seemeth as if thine heart were already\r\nbecome a part of mine, and I feel as if the chieftain were growing up in\r\nme and the longing for deeds: so I say, Tell me, for I were fain to hear\r\nwhat toucheth the welfare of thy Folk and their fellowship with my Folk;\r\nfor on that also have I set my heart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said gravely and with solemn eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What thou sayest is good: full glad am I that I have not plighted my\r\ntroth to a mere goodly lad, but rather to a chieftain and a warrior.  Now\r\nthen hearken!  Since I saw thee first in the autumn this hath happened,\r\nthat the Dusky Men, increasing both in numbers and insolence, have it in\r\ntheir hearts to win more than Silver-dale, and it is years since they\r\nhave fallen upon Rose-dale and conquered it, rather by murder than by\r\nbattle, and made all men thralls there, for feeble were the Folk thereof;\r\nand doubt it not but that they will look into Burgdale before long.  They\r\nare already abroad in the woods, and were it not for the fear of the Wolf\r\nthey would be thicker therein, and faring wider; for we have slain many\r\nof them, coming upon them unawares; and they know not where we dwell, nor\r\nwho we be: so they fear to spread about over-much and pry into unknown\r\nplaces lest the Wolf howl on them.  Yet beware! for they will gather in\r\nnumbers that we may not meet, and then will they swarm into the Dale; and\r\nif ye would live your happy life that ye love so well, ye must now fight\r\nfor it; and in that battle must ye needs join yourselves to us, that we\r\nmay help each other.  Herein have ye nought to choose, for now with you\r\nit is no longer a thing to talk of whether ye will help certain strangers\r\nand guests and thereby win some gain to yourselves, but whether ye have\r\nthe hearts to fight for yourselves, and the wits to be the fellows of\r\ntall men and stout warriors who have pledged their lives to win or die\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was silent a little and then turned and looked fondly on Face-of-god\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Therefore, Gold-mane, we need thee no longer; for thou must needs fight\r\nin our battle.  I have no longer aught to do to wheedle thee to love me.\r\nYet if thou wilt love me, then am I a glad woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou wottest well that thou hast all my love, neither will I\r\nfail thee in the battle.  I am not little-hearted, though I would have\r\ngiven myself to thee for no reward.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Sun-beam; \xe2\x80\x98nought is undone by that which I have\r\ndone.  Moreover, it is good that we have plighted troth to-day.  For\r\nFolk-might will presently hear thereof, and he must needs abide the thing\r\nwhich is done.  Hearken! he cometh.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor as she spoke there came a glad cry from the women and children, and\r\nthose two stood up and turned toward the west and beheld the warriors of\r\nthe Wolf coming down into the Dale by the way that Gold-mane had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Sun-beam, \xe2\x80\x98here are your brethren in arms, let us go\r\ngreet them; they will rejoice in thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they went thither, and there stood eighty and seven men on the grass\r\nbelow the scree and Folk-might their captain; and besides some valiant\r\nwomen, and a few carles who were on watch on the waste, and a half score\r\nwho had been left in the Dale, these were all the warriors of the Wolf.\r\nThey were clad in no holiday raiment, not even Folk-might, but were in\r\nsheep-brown gear of the coarsest, like to husbandmen late come from the\r\nplough, but armed well and goodly.\r\n\r\nBut when the twain drew near, the men clashed their spears on their\r\nshields, and cried out for joy of them, for they all knew what\r\nFace-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s presence there betokened of fellowship with the kindreds;\r\nbut Folk-might came forward and took Face-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s hand and greeted him\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hail, son of the Alderman!  Here hast thou come into the ancient abode\r\nof chieftains and warriors, and belike deeds await thee also.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet his brow was knitted as he said these words, and he spake slowly, as\r\none that constraineth himself; but presently his face cleared somewhat\r\nand he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dalesman, it behoveth thy people to bestir them if ye would live and see\r\ngood days.  Hath my sister told thee what is toward?  Or what sayest\r\nthou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hail to thee, son of the Wolf!\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.  \xe2\x80\x98Thy sister hath told\r\nme all; and even if these Dusky Felons were not our foe-men also, yet\r\ncould I have my way, we should have given thee all help, and should have\r\nbrought back peace and good days to thy folk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Folk-might flushed red and spake, as he cast out his hand towards\r\nthe warriors and up and down toward the Dale:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These be my folk, and these only: and as to peace, only those of us know\r\nof it who are old men.  Yet is it well; and if we and ye together be\r\nstrong enough to bring back good days to the feeble men whom the Dusky\r\nOnes torment in Silver-dale it shall be better yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he turned about to his sister, and looked keenly into her eyes till\r\nshe reddened, and took her hand and looked at the wrist and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O sister, see I not the mark on thy wrist of the Ring of the God of the\r\nEarth?  Have not oaths been sworn since yesterday?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True it is,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that this man and I have plighted troth together\r\nat the altar of the Doom-ring.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Thou wilt have thy will, and I may not amend it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTherewith he turned about to Face-of-god and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou must look to it to keep this oath, whatever other one thou hast\r\nfailed in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god somewhat wrathfully: \xe2\x80\x98I shall keep it, whether thou\r\nbiddest me to keep it or break it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98and then for all that hath gone before\r\nthou mayest in a manner pay, if thou art dauntless before the foe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I look to be no blencher in the battle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; \xe2\x80\x98that is not\r\nthe fashion of our kindred, whosoever may be before us.  Yea, and even\r\nwere it thy blade, O mighty warrior of the Wolf, I would do my best to\r\nmeet it in manly fashion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spake he half drew forth Dale-warden from his sheath, looking\r\nsteadily into the eyes of Folk-might; and the Sun-beam looked upon him\r\nhappily.  But Folk-might laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thy sword is good, and I deem that thine heart will not fail thee; but\r\nit is by my side and not in face of me that thou shalt redden the good\r\nblade: I see not the day when we twain shall hew at each other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen in a while he spake again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou must pardon us if our words are rough; for we have stood in rough\r\nplaces, where we had to speak both short and loud, whereas there was much\r\nto do.  But now will we twain talk of matters that concern chieftains who\r\nare going on a hard adventure.  And ye women, do ye dight the Hall for\r\nthe evening feast, which shall be the feast of the troth-plight for you\r\ntwain.  This indeed we owe thee, O guest; for little shall be thine\r\nheritage which thou shalt have with my sister, over and above that thy\r\nsword winneth for thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the Sun-beam said: \xe2\x80\x98Hast thou any to-night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98Spear-god, how many was it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere came forward a tall man bearing an axe in his right hand, and\r\ncarrying over his shoulder by his left hand a bundle of silver arm-rings\r\njust such as Gold-mane had seen on the felons who were slain by\r\nWood-grey\xe2\x80\x99s house.  The carle cast them on the ground and then knelt down\r\nand fell to telling them over; and then looked up and said: \xe2\x80\x98Twelve\r\nyesterday in the wood where the battle was going on; and this morning\r\nseven by the tarn in the pine-wood and six near this eastern edge of the\r\nwood: one score and five all told.  But, Folk-might, they are coming nigh\r\nto Shadowy Vale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sooth is that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might; \xe2\x80\x98but it shall be looked to.  Come now\r\napart with me, Face-of-god.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the others went their ways toward the Hall, while Folk-might led the\r\nBurgdaler to a sheltered nook under the sheer rocks, and there they sat\r\ndown to talk, and Folk-might asked Gold-mane closely of the muster of the\r\nDalesmen and the Shepherds and the Woodland Caries, and he was well\r\npleased when Face-of-god told him of how many could march to a stricken\r\nfield, and of their archery, and of their weapons and their goodness.\r\n\r\nAll this took some time in the telling, and now night was coming on\r\napace, and Folk-might said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now will it be time to go to the Hall; but keep in thy mind that these\r\nDusky Men will overrun you unless ye deal with them betimes.  These are\r\nof the kind that ye must cast fear into their hearts by falling on them;\r\nfor if ye abide till they fall upon you, they are like the winter wolves\r\nthat swarm on and on, how many soever ye slay.  And this above all things\r\nshall help you, that we shall bring you whereas ye shall fall on them\r\nunawares and destroy them as boys do with a wasp\xe2\x80\x99s nest.  Yet shall many\r\na mother\xe2\x80\x99s son bite the dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not so that in four weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time is your spring-feast and market at\r\nBurgstead, and thereafter the great Folk-mote?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thither shall I come then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98and give myself out for\r\nthe slayer of Rusty and the ransacker of Harts-bane and Penny-thumb; and\r\ntherefor shall I offer good blood-wite and theft-wite; and thy father\r\nshall take that; for he is a just man.  Then shall I tell my tale.  Yet\r\nit may be thou shalt see us before if battle betide.  And now fair befall\r\nthis new year; for soon shall the scabbards be empty and the white swords\r\nbe dancing in the air, and spears and axes shall be the growth of this\r\nspring-tide.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he leaped up from his seat and walked to and fro before Gold-mane,\r\nand now was it grown quite dark.  Then Folk-might turned to Face-of-god\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, guest, the windows of the Hall are yellow; let us to the feast.\r\nTo-morrow shalt thou get thee to the beginning of this work.  I hope of\r\nthee that thou art a good sword; else have I done a folly and my sister a\r\nworse one.  But now forget that, and feast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGold-mane arose, not very well at ease, for the man seemed overbearing;\r\nyet how might he fall upon the Sun-beam\xe2\x80\x99s kindred, and the captain of\r\nthese new brethren in arms?  So he spake not.  But Folk-might said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet I would not have thee forget that I was wroth with thee when I saw\r\nthee to-day; and had it not been for the coming battle I had drawn sword\r\nupon thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s wrath was stirred, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is yet time for that! but why art thou wroth with me?  And I shall\r\ntell thee that there is little manliness in thy chiding.  For how may I\r\nfight with thee, thou the brother of my plighted speech-friend and my\r\ncaptain in this battle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Therein thou sayest sooth,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might; \xe2\x80\x98but hard it was to see you\r\ntwo standing together; and thou canst not give the Bride to me as I give\r\nmy sister to thee.  For I have seen her, and I have seen her looking at\r\nthee; and I know that she will not have it so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen they went on together toward the Hall, and Face-of-god was silent\r\nand somewhat troubled; and as they drew near to the Hall, Folk-might\r\nspake again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet time may amend it; and if not, there is the battle, and maybe the\r\nend.  Now be we merry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they went into the Hall together, and there was the Sun-beam\r\ngloriously arrayed, as erst in the woodland bower, and Face-of-god sat on\r\nthe da\xc3\xafs beside her, and the uttermost sweetness of desire entered into\r\nhis soul as he noted her eyes and her mouth, that were grown so kind to\r\nhim, and her hand that strayed toward his.\r\n\r\nThe Hall was full of folk, and all those warriors were there with\r\nWood-father and his sons, and Wood-mother, and Bow-may and many other\r\nwomen; and Gold-mane looked down the Hall and deemed that he had never\r\nseen such stalwarth bodies of men, or so bold and meet for battle: as for\r\nthe women he had seen fairer in Burgdale, but these were fair of their\r\nown fashion, shapely and well-knit, and strong-armed and large-limbed,\r\nyet sweet-voiced and gentle withal.  Nay, the very lads of fifteen\r\nwinters or so, whereof a few were there, seemed bold and bright-eyed and\r\nkeen of wit, and it seemed like that if the warriors fared afield these\r\nwould be with them.\r\n\r\nSo wore the feast; and Folk-might as aforetime amongst the healths called\r\non men to drink to the Jaws of the Wolf, and the Red Hand, and the Silver\r\nArm, and the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged Sword.  But now had\r\nFace-of-god no need to ask what these meant, since he knew that they were\r\nthe names of the kindreds of the Wolf.  They drank also to the\r\ntroth-plight and to those twain, and shouted aloud over the health and\r\nclashed their weapons: and Gold-mane wondered what echo of that shout\r\nwould reach to Burgstead.\r\n\r\nThen sang men songs of old time, and amongst them Wood-wont stood with\r\nhis fiddle amidst the Hall and Bow-may beside him, and they sang in turn\r\nto it sweetly and clearly; and this is some of what they sang:\r\n\r\n                              _She singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Wild is the waste and long leagues over;\r\n      Whither then wend ye spear and sword,\r\n   Where nought shall see your helms but the plover,\r\n      Far and far from the dear Dale\xe2\x80\x99s sward?\r\n\r\n                              _He singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Many a league shall we wend together\r\n      With helm and spear and bended bow.\r\n   Hark! how the wind blows up for weather:\r\n      Dark shall the night be whither we go.\r\n\r\n   Dark shall the night be round the byre,\r\n      And dark as we drive the brindled kine;\r\n   Dark and dark round the beacon-fire,\r\n      Dark down in the pass round our wavering line.\r\n\r\n   Turn on thy path, O fair-foot maiden,\r\n      And come our ways by the pathless road;\r\n   Look how the clouds hang low and laden\r\n      Over the walls of the old abode!\r\n\r\n                              _She singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Bare are my feet for the rough waste\xe2\x80\x99s wending,\r\n      Wild is the wind, and my kirtle\xe2\x80\x99s thin;\r\n   Faint shall I be ere the long way\xe2\x80\x99s ending\r\n      Drops down to the Dale and the grief therein.\r\n\r\n                              _He singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Do on the brogues of the wild-wood rover,\r\n      Do on the byrnies\xe2\x80\x99 ring-close mail;\r\n   Take thou the staff that the barbs hang over,\r\n      O\xe2\x80\x99er the wind and the waste and the way to prevail.\r\n\r\n   Come, for how from thee shall I sunder?\r\n      Come, that a tale may arise in the land;\r\n   Come, that the night may be held for a wonder,\r\n      When the Wolf was led by a maiden\xe2\x80\x99s hand!\r\n\r\n                              _She singeth_.\r\n\r\n   Now will I fare as ye are faring,\r\n      And wend no way but the way ye wend;\r\n   And bear but the burdens ye are bearing,\r\n      And end the day as ye shall end.\r\n\r\n   And many an eve when the clouds are drifting\r\n      Down through the Dale till they dim the roof,\r\n   Shall they tell in the Hall of the Maiden\xe2\x80\x99s Lifting,\r\n      And how we drave the spoil aloof.\r\n\r\n                          _They sing together_.\r\n\r\n   Over the moss through the wind and the weather,\r\n      Through the morn and the eve and the death of the day,\r\n   Wend we man and maid together,\r\n      For out of the waste is born the fray.\r\n\r\nThen the Sun-beam spake to Gold-mane softly, and told him how this song\r\nwas made by a minstrel concerning a foray in the early days of their\r\nfirst abode in Shadowy Vale, and how in good sooth a maiden led the fray\r\nand was the captain of the warriors:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Erst,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98this was counted as a wonder; but now we are so few\r\nthat it is no wonder though the women will do whatsoever they may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they talked, and Gold-mane was very happy; but ere the good-night cup\r\nwas drunk, Folk-might spake to Face-of-god and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It were well that ye rose betimes in the morning: but thou shalt not go\r\nback by the way thou camest.  Wood-wise and another shall go with thee,\r\nand show thee a way across the necks and the heaths, which is rough\r\nenough as far as toil goes, but where thy life shall be safer; and\r\nthereby shalt thou hit the ghyll of the Weltering Water, and so come down\r\nsafely into Burgdale.  Now that we are friends and fellows, it is no hurt\r\nfor thee to know the shortest way to Shadowy Vale.  What thou shalt tell\r\nconcerning us in Burgdale I leave the tale thereof to thee; yet belike\r\nthou wilt not tell everything till I come to Burgstead at the spring\r\nmarket-tide.  Now must I presently to bed; for before daylight to-morrow\r\nmust I be following the hunt along with two score good men of ours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What beast is afield then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane.\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98The beasts that beset our lives, the Dusky Men.  In\r\nthese days we have learned how to find companies of them; and forsooth\r\nevery week they draw nigher to this Dale; and some day they should happen\r\nupon us if we were not to look to it, and then would there be a murder\r\ngreat and grim; therefore we scour the heaths round about, and the skirts\r\nof the woodland, and we fall upon these felons in divers guises, so that\r\nthey may not know us for the same men; whiles are we clad in homespun, as\r\nto-day, and seem like to field-working carles; whiles in scarlet and\r\ngold, like knights of the Westland; whiles in wolf-skins; whiles in white\r\nglittering gear, like the Wights of the Waste: and in all guises these\r\nfelons, for all their fierce hearts, fear us, and flee from us, and we\r\nfollow and slay them, and so minish their numbers somewhat against the\r\ngreat day of battle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane; \xe2\x80\x98when we fall upon Silver-dale shall their\r\nthralls, the old Dale-dwellers, fight for them or for us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98The Dusky Men will not dare to put weapons into the\r\nhands of their thralls.  Nay, the thralls shall help us; for though they\r\nhave but small stomach for the fight, yet joyfully when the fight is over\r\nshall they cut their masters\xe2\x80\x99 throats.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is it with these thralls?\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane.  \xe2\x80\x98I have never seen a\r\nthrall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98have seen a many down in the Cities.  And\r\nthere were thralls who were the tyrants of thralls, and held the whip\r\nover them; and of the others there were some who were not very hardly\r\nentreated.  But with these it is otherwise, and they all bear grievous\r\npains daily; for the Dusky Men are as hogs in a garden of lilies.\r\nWhatsoever is fair there have they defiled and deflowered, and they\r\nwallow in our fair halls as swine strayed from the dunghill.  No delight\r\nin life, no sweet days do they have for themselves, and they begrudge the\r\ndelight of others therein.  Therefore their thralls know no rest or\r\nsolace; their reward of toil is many stripes, and the healing of their\r\nstripes grievous toil.  To many have they appointed to dig and mine in\r\nthe silver-yielding cliffs, and of all the tasks is that the sorest, and\r\nthere do stripes abound the most.  Such thralls art thou happy not to\r\nbehold till thou hast set them free; as we shall do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; \xe2\x80\x98Is there no mixed folk between these\r\nDusky Men and the Dalesmen, since they have no women of their own, but\r\nlie with the women of the Dale?  Moreover, do not the poor folk of the\r\nDale beget and bear children, so that there are thralls born of thralls?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wisely thou askest this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98but thereof shall I tell\r\nthee, that when a Dusky Carle mingles with a woman of the Dale, the child\r\nwhich she beareth shall oftenest favour his race and not hers; or else\r\nshall it be witless, a fool natural.  But as for the children of these\r\npoor thralls; yea, the masters cause them to breed if so their\r\nmasterships will, and when the children are born, they keep them or slay\r\nthem as they will, as they would with whelps or calves.  To be short,\r\nyear by year these vile wretches grow fiercer and more beastly, and their\r\nthralls more hapless and down-trodden; and now at last is come the time\r\neither to do or to die, as ye men of Burgdale shall speedily find out.\r\nBut now must I go sleep if I am to be where I look to be at sunrise\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he called for the sleeping-cup, and it was drunk, and all men\r\nfared to bed.  But the Sun-beam took Gold-mane\xe2\x80\x99s hand ere they parted,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall arise betimes on the morrow; so I say not farewell to-night;\r\nyea, and after to-morrow it shall not be long ere we meet again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Gold-mane lay down in that ancient hall, and it seemed to him ere he\r\nslept as if his own kindred were slipping away from him and he were\r\nbecoming a child of the Wolf.  \xe2\x80\x98And yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nbecome a man; for my Friend, now she no longer telleth me to do or\r\nforbear, and I tremble.  Nay, rather she is fain to take the word from\r\nme; and this great warrior and ripe man, he talketh with me as if I were\r\na chieftain meet for converse with chieftains.  Even so it is and shall\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd soon thereafter he fell asleep in the Hall in Shadowy Vale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.  FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON THE DUSKY MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN he awoke again he saw a man standing over him, and knew him for\r\nWood-wise: he was clad in his war-gear, and had his quiver at his back\r\nand his bow in his hand, for Wood-father\xe2\x80\x99s children were all good bowmen,\r\nthough not so sure as Bow-may.  He spake to Face-of-god:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dawn is in the sky, Dalesman; there is yet time for thee to wash the\r\nnight off of thee in our bath of the Shivering Flood and to put thy mouth\r\nto the milk-bowl; but time for nought else: for I and Bow-may are\r\nappointed thy fellows for the road, and it were well that we were back\r\nhome speedily.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Face-of-god leapt up and went forth from the Hall, and Wood-wise led\r\nto where was a pool in the river with steps cut down to it in the rocky\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wood-wise, \xe2\x80\x98is the Carle\xe2\x80\x99s Bath; but the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s is lower\r\ndown, where the water is wider and shallower below the little mid-dale\r\nforce.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Gold-mane stripped off his raiment and leapt into the ice-cold pool;\r\nand they had brought his weapons and war-gear with them; so when he came\r\nout he clad and armed himself for the road, and then turned with\r\nWood-wise toward the outgate of the Dale; and soon they saw two men\r\ncoming from lower down the water in such wise that they would presently\r\ncross their path, and as yet it was little more than twilight, so that\r\nthey saw not at first who they were, but as they drew nearer they knew\r\nthem for the Sun-beam and Bow-may.  The Sun-beam was clad but in her\r\nwhite linen smock and blue gown as he had first seen her, her hair was\r\nwet and dripping with the river, her face fresh and rosy: she carried in\r\nher two hands a great bowl of milk, and stepped delicately, lest she\r\nshould spill it.  But Bow-may was clad in her war-gear with helm and\r\nbyrny, and a quiver at her back, and a bended bow in her hand.  So they\r\ngreeted each other kindly, and the Sun-beam gave the bowl to Face-of-god\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drink, guest, for thou hast a long and thirsty road before thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Face-of-god drank, and gave her the bowl back again, and she smiled on\r\nhim and drank, and the others after her till the bowl was empty: then\r\nBow-may put her hand on Wood-wise\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and they led on toward the\r\noutgate, while those twain followed them hand in hand.  But the Sun-beam\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This then is the new day I spoke of, and lo! it bringeth our sundering\r\nwith it; yet shall it be no longer than a day when all is said, and new\r\ndays shall follow after.  And now, my friend, I shall see thee no later\r\nthan the April market; for doubt not that I shall go thither with\r\nFolk-might, whether he will or not.  Also as I led thee out of the house\r\nwhen we last met, so shall I lead thee out of the Dale to-day, and I will\r\ngo with thee a little way on the waste; and therefore am I shod this\r\nmorning, as thou seest, for the ways on the waste are rough.  And now I\r\nbid thee have courage while my hand holdeth thine.  For afterwards I need\r\nnot bid thee anything; for thou wilt have enough to do when thou comest\r\nto thy Folk, and must needs think more of warriors then than of maidens.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at her and longed for her, but said soberly: \xe2\x80\x98Thou art kind, O\r\nfriend, and thinkest kindly of me ever.  But methinks it were not well\r\ndone for thee to wend with me over a deal of the waste, and come back by\r\nthyself alone, when ye have so many foemen nearby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98they be nought so near as that yet, and I wot that\r\nFolk-might hath gone forth toward the north-west, where he looketh to\r\nfall in with a company of the foemen.  His battle shall be a guard unto\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I pray thee turn back at the top of the outgate,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98and be not\r\nventuresome.  Thou wottest that the pitcher is not broken the first time\r\nit goeth to the well, nor maybe the twentieth, but at last it cometh not\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Nevertheless I shall have my will herein.  And it is but a\r\nlittle way I will wend with thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith were they come to the scree, and talk fell down between them as\r\nthey clomb it; but when they were in the darksome passage of the rocks,\r\nand could scarce see one another, Face-of-god said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where then is another outgate from the Dale?  Is it not up the water?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and there is none other: at the lower end the rocks\r\nrise sheer from out the water, and a little further down is a great force\r\nthundering betwixt them; so that by no boat or raft may ye come out of\r\nthe Dale.  But the outgate up the water is called the Road of War, as\r\nthis is named the Path of Peace.  But now are all ways ways of war.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is peace in my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane.\r\n\r\nShe answered not for a while, but pressed his hand, and he felt her\r\nbreath on his cheek; and even therewithal they came out of the dark, and\r\nGold-mane saw that her cheek was flushed; and now she spake:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One thing would I say to thee, my friend.  Thou hast seen me amongst men\r\nof war, amongst outlaws who seek violence; thou hast heard me bid my\r\nbrother to count the slain, and I shrinking not; thou knowest (for I have\r\ntold thee) how I have schemed and schemed for victorious battle.  Yet I\r\nwould not have thee think of me as a Chooser of the Slain, a warrior\r\nmaiden, or as of one who hath no joy save in the battle whereto she\r\nbiddeth others.  O friend, the many peaceful hours that I have had on the\r\ngrass down yonder, sitting with my rock and spindle in hand, the children\r\nround about my knees hearkening to some old story so well remembered by\r\nme! or the milking of the kine in the dewy summer even, when all was\r\nstill but for the voice of the water and the cries of the happy children,\r\nand there round about me were the dear and beauteous maidens with whom I\r\nhad grown up, happy amidst all our troubles, since their life was free\r\nand they knew no guile.  In such times my heart was at peace indeed, and\r\nit seemed to me as if we had won all we needed; as if war and turmoil\r\nwere over, after they had brought about peace and good days for our\r\nlittle folk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as for the days that be, are they not as that rugged pass, full of\r\nbitter winds and the voice of hurrying waters, that leadeth yonder to\r\nSilver-dale, as thou hast divined? and there is nought good in it save\r\nthat the breath of life is therein, and that it leadeth to pleasant\r\nplaces and the peace and plenty of the fair dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sweet friend,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98what thou sayest is better than well: for time\r\nshall be, if we come alive out of this pass of battle and bitter strife,\r\nwhen I shall lead thee into Burgdale to dwell there.  And thou wottest of\r\nour people that there is little strife and grudging amongst them, and\r\nthat they are merry, and fair to look on, both men and women; and no man\r\nthere lacketh what the earth may give us, and it is a saying amongst us\r\nthat there may a man have that which he desireth save the sun and moon in\r\nhis hands to play with: and of this gladness, which is made up of many\r\nlittle matters, what story may be told?  Yet amongst it shall I live and\r\nthou with me; and ill indeed it were if it wearied thee and thou wert\r\never longing for some day of victorious strife, and to behold me coming\r\nback from battle high-raised on the shields of men and crowned with bay;\r\nif thine ears must ever be tickled with the talk of men and their songs\r\nconcerning my warrior deeds.  For thus it shall not be.  When I drive the\r\nherds it shall be at the neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 bidding whereso they will; not necks\r\nof men shall I smite, but the stalks of the tall wheat, and the boles of\r\nthe timber-trees which the woodreeve hath marked for felling; the stilts\r\nof the plough rather than the hilts of the sword shall harden my hands;\r\nmy shafts shall be for the deer, and my spears for the wood-boar, till\r\nwar and sorrow fall upon us, and I fight for the ceasing of war and\r\ntrouble.  And though I be called a chief and of the blood of chiefs, yet\r\nshall I not be masterful to the goodman of the Dale, but rather to my\r\nhound; for my chieftainship shall be that I shall be well beloved and\r\ntrusted, and that no man shall grudge against me.  Canst thou learn to\r\nlove such a life, which to me seemeth lovely?  And thou? of whom I say\r\nthat thou art as if thou wert come down from the golden chairs of the\r\nBurg of the Gods.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were well-nigh out of the steep path by now, and the daylight was\r\nbright about them; there she stayed her feet a moment and turned to him\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All this should I love even now, if the grief of our Folk were but\r\nhealed, and hereafter shall I learn yet more of thy well-beloved face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she laid her face to his and kissed him fondly, and put his\r\nhand to her side and held it there, saying: \xe2\x80\x98Soon shall we be one in body\r\nand in soul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he laughed with joy and pride of life, and took her hand and led her\r\non again, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet feel the cold rings of my hauberk, my friend; look at the spears\r\nthat cumber my hand, and at Dale-warden hanging by my side.  Thou shalt\r\nyet see me as the Slain\xe2\x80\x99s Chooser would see her speech-friend; for there\r\nis much to do ere we win wheat-harvest in Burgdale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith they stepped together on to the level ground of the waste, and\r\nsaw Bow-may sitting on a stone hard by, and Wood-wise standing beside her\r\nbending his bow.  Bow-may smiled on Gold-mane and rose up, and they all\r\nwent on together, turning so that they went nearly alongside the wall of\r\nthe Vale, but westering a little; then the Sun-beam said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many a time have I trodden this heath alongside our rock-wall; for if ye\r\nwend a little further as our faces are turned, ye come to the crags over\r\nthe place where the Shivering Flood goeth out of Shadowy Vale.  There\r\nwhen ye have clomb a little may\xe2\x80\x99st thou stand on the edge of the\r\nrock-wall, and look down and behold the Flood swirling and eddying in the\r\nblack gorge of the rocks, and see presently the reek of the force go up,\r\nand hear the thunder of the waters as they pour over it: and all this\r\nabout us now is as the garden of our house\xe2\x80\x94is it not so, Bow-may?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98and there are goodly cluster-berries to be gotten\r\nhereabout in the autumn; many a time have the Sun-beam and I reddened our\r\nlips with them.  Yet is it best to be wary when war is abroad and hot\r\nwithal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Sun-beam, \xe2\x80\x98and all this place comes into the story of our\r\nHouse: lo!  Gold-mane, two score paces before us a little on our right\r\nhand those five grey stones.  They are called the Rocks of the Elders:\r\nfor there in the first days of our abiding in Shadowy Vale the Elders\r\nwere wont to come together to talk privily upon our matters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god looked thither as she spoke, but therewith saw Bow-may, who\r\nwent on the left hand of the Sun-beam, as Face-of-god on her right hand,\r\nnotch a shaft on her bent bow, and Wood-wise, who was on his right hand,\r\nsaw it also and did the like, and therewithal Face-of-god got his target\r\non to his arm, and even as he did so Bow-may cried out suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, yea!  Cast thyself on to the ground, Sun-beam!  Gold-mane, targe\r\nand spear, targe and spear!  For I see steel gleaming yonder out from\r\nbehind the Elders\xe2\x80\x99 Rocks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nScarce were the words out of her mouth ere three shafts came flying, and\r\nthe bow-strings twanged.  Gold-mane felt that one smote his helm and\r\nglanced from it.  Therewithal he saw the Sun-beam fall to earth, though\r\nhe knew not if she had but cast herself down as Bow-may bade.  Bow-may\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstring twanged at once, and a yell came from the foemen: but Wood-wise\r\nloosed not, but set his hand to his mouth and gave a loud wild cry\xe2\x80\x94Ha!\r\nha! ha! ha!  How-ow-ow!\xe2\x80\x94ending in a long and exceeding great whoop like\r\nnought but the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s howl.  Now Gold-mane thinking swiftly, in a moment\r\nof time, as war-meet men do, judged that if the Sun-beam were hurt (and\r\nshe had made no cry), it were yet wiser to fall on the foe before turning\r\nto tend her, or else all might be lost; so he rushed forward spear in\r\nhand and target on arm, and saw, as he opened up the flank of the Elders\xe2\x80\x99\r\nRocks, six men, whereof one leaned aback on the rock with Bow-may\xe2\x80\x99s shaft\r\nin his shoulder, and two others were just in act of loosing at him.  In a\r\nmoment, as he rushed at them, one shaft went whistling by him, and the\r\nother glanced from off his target; he cast a spear as he bounded on, and\r\nsaw it smite one of the shooters full in the naked face, and saw the\r\nblood spout out and change his face and the man roll over, and then in\r\nanother moment four men were hewing at him with their short steel axes.\r\nHe thrust out his target against them, and then let the weight of his\r\nbody come on his other spear, and drave it through the second shooter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthroat, and even therewith was smitten on the helm so hard that, though\r\nthe Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s work held out, he fell to his knees, holding his target\r\nover his head and striving to draw forth Dale-warden; in that nick of\r\ntime a shaft whistled close by his ear, and as he rose to his feet again\r\nhe saw his foeman rolling over and over, clutching at the ling with both\r\nhands.  Then rang out again the terrible wolf-whoop from Wood-wise\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth, and both he and Bow-may loosed a shaft, for the two other foes had\r\nturned their backs and were fleeing fast.  Again Bow-may hit the clout,\r\nand the Dusky Man fell dead at once, but Wood-wise\xe2\x80\x99s arrow flew over the\r\nfelon\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder as he ran.  Then in a trice was Gold-mane bounding after\r\nhim like the hare just roused from her form; for it came into his head\r\nthat these felons had beheld them coming up out of the Vale, and that if\r\neven this one man escaped, he would bring his company down upon the\r\nVale-dwellers.\r\n\r\nStrong and light-foot as any was Face-of-god, and though he was cumbered\r\nwith his hauberk, yet was Iron-face\xe2\x80\x99s handiwork far lighter than the\r\nwar-coat of the Dusky Man, and the race was soon over.  The felon turned\r\nbreathless to meet Gold-mane, who drave his target against him and cast\r\nhim to earth, and as he strove to rise smote off his head at one stroke;\r\nfor Dale-warden was a good sword and the Dalesman as fierce of mood as\r\nmight be.  There he let the felon lie, and, turning, walked back swiftly\r\ntoward the Elders\xe2\x80\x99 Rocks, and found there Wood-wise and the dead foemen,\r\nfor the carle had slain the wounded, and he was now drawing the silver\r\narm-rings off the slain men; for all these Dusky Felons bore silver\r\narm-rings.  But Bow-may was walking towards the Sun-beam, and thitherward\r\nfollowed Gold-mane speedily.\r\n\r\nHe found her sitting on a tussock of grass close by where she had fallen,\r\nher face pale, her eyes eager and gleaming; she looked up at him as he\r\ndrew nigher and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friend, art thou hurt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and thou?  Thou art pale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not hurt,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  Then she smiled and said again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I not tell thee that I am no warrior like Bow-may here?  Such deeds\r\nmake maidens pale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Bow-may: \xe2\x80\x98If ye will have the truth, Gold-mane, she is not wont to\r\ngrow pale when battle is nigh her.  Look you, she hath had the gift of a\r\nnew delight, and findeth it sweeter and softer than she had any thought\r\nof; and now hath she feared lest it should be taken from her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bow-may saith but the sooth,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Sun-beam simply, \xe2\x80\x98and kind it is\r\nof her to say it.  I saw thee, Bow-may, and good was thy shooting, and I\r\nlove thee for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Bow-may: \xe2\x80\x98I never shoot otherwise than well.  But those idle\r\nshooters of the Dusky Ones, whereabouts nigh to thee went their shafts?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the Sun-beam: \xe2\x80\x98One just lifted the hair by my left ear, and that was\r\nnot so ill-aimed; as for the other, it pierced my raiment by my right\r\nknee, and pinned me to the earth, so that I tottered and fell, and my\r\ngown and smock are grievously wounded, both of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she took the folds of the garments in her hands to show the rents\r\ntherein; and her colour was come again, and she was glad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What were best to do now?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Let us tarry a little; for some of thy carles shall\r\nsurely come up from the Vale: because they will have heard Wood-wise\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhoop, since the wind sets that way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, they will come,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Sun-beam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good is that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; \xe2\x80\x98for they shall take the dead felons\r\nand cast them where they be not seen if perchance any more stray hereby.\r\nFor if they wind them, they may well happen on the path down to the Vale.\r\nAlso, my friend, it were well if thou wert to bid a good few of the\r\ncarles that are in the Vale to keep watch and ward about here, lest there\r\nbe more foemen wandering about the waste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou art wise in war, Gold-mane; I will do as thou biddest me.\r\nBut soothly this is a perilous thing that the Dusky Men are gotten so\r\nclose to the Vale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98This will Folk-might look to when he cometh home; and\r\nit is most like that he will deem it good to fall on them somewhere a\r\ngood way aloof, so as to draw them off from wandering over the waste.\r\nAlso I will do my best to busy them when I am home in Burgdale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith came up Wood-wise, and fell to talk with them; and his mind it\r\nwas that these foemen were but a band of strayers, and had had no inkling\r\nof Shadowy Vale till they had heard them talking together as they came up\r\nthe path from the Vale, and that then they had made that ambush behind\r\nthe Elders\xe2\x80\x99 Rocks, so that they might slay the men, and then bear off the\r\nwoman.  He said withal that it would be best to carry their corpses\r\nfurther on, so that they might be cast over the cliffs into the fierce\r\nstream of the Shivering Flood.\r\n\r\nAmidst this talk came up men from the Vale, a score of them, well armed;\r\nand they ran to meet the wayfarers; and when they heard what had\r\nbefallen, they rejoiced exceedingly, and were above all glad that\r\nFace-of-god had shown himself doughty and deft; and they deemed his rede\r\nwise, to set a watch thereabouts till Folk-might came home, and said that\r\nthey would do even so.\r\n\r\nThen spake the Sun-beam and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now must ye wayfarers depart; for the road is but rough, and the day not\r\nover-long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she turned to Face-of-god and put her hand on his shoulder, and\r\nbrought her face close to his and spake to him softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doth this second parting seem at all strange to thee, and that I am now\r\nso familiar to thee, I whom thou didst once deem to be a very goddess?\r\nAnd now thou hast seen me redden before thine eyes because of thee; and\r\nthou hast seen me grow pale with fear because of thee; and thou hast felt\r\nmy caresses which I might not refrain; even as if I were altogether such\r\na maiden as ye warriors hang about for a nine days\xe2\x80\x99 wonder, and then all\r\nis over save an aching heart\xe2\x80\x94wilt thou do so with me?  Tell me, have I\r\nnot belittled myself before thee as if I asked thee to scorn me?  For\r\nthus desire dealeth both with maid and man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98In all this there is but one thing for me to say, and that is\r\nthat I love thee; and surely none the less, but rather the more, because\r\nthou lovest me, and art of my kind, and mayest share in my deeds and\r\nthink well of them.  Now is my heart full of joy, and one thing only\r\nweigheth on it; and that is that my kinswoman the Bride begrudgeth our\r\nlove together.  For this is the thing that of all things most misliketh\r\nme, that any should bear a grudge against me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Forget not the token, and my message to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not forget it,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.  \xe2\x80\x98And now I bid thee to kiss me even\r\nbefore all these that are looking on; for there is nought to belittle us\r\ntherein, since we be troth-plight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd indeed those folk stood all round about them gazing on them, but a\r\nlittle aloof, that they might not hear their words if they were minded to\r\ntalk privily.  For they had long loved the Sun-beam, and now the love of\r\nFace-of-god had begun to spring up in their hearts.\r\n\r\nSo the twain embraced and kissed one another, and made no haste\r\nthereover; and those men deemed that but meet and right, and clashed\r\ntheir weapons on their shields in token of their joy.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god turned about and strode out of the ring of men, with\r\nBow-may and Wood-wise beside him, and they went on their journey over the\r\nnecks towards Burgstead.  But the Sun-beam turned slowly from that place\r\ntoward the Vale, and two of the stoutest carles went along with her to\r\nguard her from harm, and she went down into the Vale pondering all these\r\nthings in her heart.\r\n\r\nThen the other carles dragged off the corpses of the Dusky Men till they\r\nhad brought them to the sheer rocks above the Shivering Flood, and there\r\nthey tossed them over into the boiling caldron of the force, and so\r\ndeparted taking with them the silver arm-rings of the slain to add to the\r\ntale.\r\n\r\nBut when they came back into the Vale the Sun-beam duly ordered that\r\nwatch and ward to keep the ingate thereto, and note all that should\r\nbefall till Folk-might came home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.  FACE-OF-GOD COMETH HOME TO BURGSTEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT Face-of-god with Bow-may and Wood-wise fared over the waste, going at\r\nfirst alongside the cliffs of the Shivering Flood, and then afterwards\r\nturning somewhat to the west.  They soon had to climb a very high and\r\nsteep bent going up to a mountain-neck; and the way over the neck was\r\nrough indeed when they were on it, and they toiled out of it into a\r\nbarren valley, and out of the valley again on to a rough neck; and\r\nsuch-like their journey the day long, for they were going athwart all\r\nthose great dykes that went from the ice-mountains toward the lower dales\r\nlike the outspread fingers of a hand or the roots of a great tree.  And\r\nthe ice-mountains they had on their left hands and whiles at their backs.\r\n\r\nThey went very warily, with their bows bended and spear in hand, but saw\r\nno man, good or bad, and but few living things.  At noon they rested in a\r\nvalley where was a stream, but no grass, nought but stones and sand; but\r\nwhere they were at least sheltered from the wind, which was mostly very\r\ngreat in these high wastes; and there Bow-may drew meat and wine from a\r\nwallet she bore, and they ate and drank, and were merry enough; and\r\nBow-may said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would I were going all the way with thee, Gold-mane; for I long sore\r\nto let my eyes rest a while on the land where I shall one day live.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98art thou minded to dwell there?  We shall be\r\nglad of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whither are thy wits straying?\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98whether I am minded to it or\r\nnot, I shall dwell there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Wood-wise nodded a yea to her.  But Face-of-god said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good will be thy dwelling; but wherefore must it be so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Wood-wise laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98I shall tell thee in fewer words than\r\nshe will, and time presses now: Wood-father and Wood-mother, and I and my\r\ntwo brethren and this woman have ever been about and anigh the Sun-beam;\r\nand we deem that war and other troubles have made us of closer kin to her\r\nthan we were born, whether ye call it brotherhood or what not, and never\r\nshall we sunder from her in life or in death.  So when thou goest to\r\nBurgdale with her, there shall we be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen was Face-of-god glad when he found that they deemed his wedding so\r\nsettled and sure; but Wood-wise fell to making ready for the road.  And\r\nFace-of-god said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me one thing, Wood-wise; that whoop that thou gavest forth when we\r\nwere at handy-strokes e\xe2\x80\x99en now\xe2\x80\x94is it but a cry of thine own or is it of\r\nthy Folk, and shall I hear it again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou may\xe2\x80\x99st look to hear it many a time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wood-wise, \xe2\x80\x98for it is the\r\ncry of the Wolf.  Seldom indeed hath battle been joined where men of our\r\nblood are, but that cry is given forth.  Come now, to the road!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they went their ways and the road worsened upon them, and toilsome was\r\nthe climbing up steep bents and the scaling of doubtful paths in the\r\ncliff-sides, so that the journey, though the distance of it were not so\r\nlong to the fowl flying, was much eked out for them, and it was not till\r\nnear nightfall that they came on the ghyll of the Weltering Water some\r\nsix miles above Burgstead.  Forsooth Wood-wise said that the way might be\r\nmade less toilsome though far longer by turning back eastward a little\r\npast the vale where they had rested at midday; and that seemed good to\r\nGold-mane, in case they should be wending hereafter in a great company\r\nbetween Burgdale and Shadowy Vale.\r\n\r\nBut now those two went with Face-of-god down a path in the side of the\r\ncliff whereby him-seemed he had gone before; and they came down into the\r\nghyll and sat down together on a stone by the water-side, and Face-of-god\r\nspake to them kindly, for he deemed them good and trusty faring-fellows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bow-may,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98thou saidst a while ago that thou wouldst be fain to\r\nlook on Burgdale; and indeed it is fair and lovely, and ye may soon be in\r\nit if ye will.  Ye shall both be more than welcome to the house of my\r\nfather, and heartily I bid you thither.  For night is on us, and the way\r\nback is long and toilsome and beset with peril.  Sister Bow-may, thou\r\nwottest that it would be a sore grief to me if thou camest to any harm,\r\nand thou also, fellow Wood-wise.  Daylight is a good faring-fellow over\r\nthe waste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Bow-may: \xe2\x80\x98Thou art kind, Gold-mane, and that is thy wont, I know;\r\nand fain were I to-night of the candles in thine hall.  But we may not\r\ntarry; for thou wottest how busy we be at home; and Sun-beam needeth me,\r\nif it were only to make her sure that no Dusky Man is bearing off thine\r\nhead by its lovely locks.  Neither shall we journey in the mirk night;\r\nfor look you, the moon yonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98parting is ill at the best, and I would I\r\ncould give you twain a gift, and especially to thee, my sister Bow-may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Wood-wise: \xe2\x80\x98Thou may\xe2\x80\x99st well do that; or at least promise the gift;\r\nand that is all one as if we held it in our hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bow-may, \xe2\x80\x98Wood-wise and I have been thinking in one way\r\nbelike; and I was at point to ask a gift of thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane.  \xe2\x80\x98Surely it is thine, if it were but a\r\nguerdon for thy good shooting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laughed and handled the skirts of his hauberk as she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show us the dint in thine helm that the steel axe made this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no such great dint,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98my father forged that helm, and\r\nhis work is better than good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bow-may, \xe2\x80\x98and might I have hauberk and helm of his handiwork,\r\nand Wood-wise a good sword of the same, then were I a glad woman, and\r\nthis man a happy carle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98I am well pleased at thine asking, and so shall\r\nIron-face be when he heareth of thine archery; and how that Hall-face\r\nwere now his only son but for thy close shooting.  But now must I to the\r\nway; for my heart tells me that there may have been tidings in Burgstead\r\nthis while I have been aloof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they rose all three, and Bow-may said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou art a kind brother, and soon shall we meet again; and that will be\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed both her cheeks; and he\r\nkissed Wood-wise, and turned and went his ways, threading the stony\r\ntangle about the Weltering Water, which was now at middle height, and\r\nrunning clear and strong; so turning once he beheld Wood-wise and Bow-may\r\nclimbing the path up the side of the ghyll, and Bow-may turned to him\r\nalso and waved her bow as token of farewell.  Then he went upon his way,\r\nwhich was rough enough to follow by night, though the moon was shining\r\nbrightly high aloft.  Yet as he knew his road he made but little of it\r\nall, and in somewhat more than an hour and a half was come out of the\r\npass into the broken ground at the head of the Dale, and began to make\r\nhis way speedily under the bright moonlight toward the Gate, still going\r\nclose by the water.  But as he went he heard of a sudden cries and rumour\r\nnot far from him, unwonted in that place, where none dwelt, and where the\r\nonly folk he might look to see were those who cast an angle into the\r\npools and eddies of the Water.  Moreover, he saw about the place whence\r\ncame the cries torches moving swiftly hither and thither; so that he\r\nlooked to hear of new tidings, and stayed his feet and looked keenly\r\nabout him on every side; and just then, between his rough path and the\r\nshimmer of the dancing moonlit water, he saw the moon smite on something\r\ngleaming; so, as quietly as he could, he got his target on his arm, and\r\nshortened his spear in his right hand, and then turned sharply toward\r\nthat gleam.  Even therewith up sprang a man on his right hand, and then\r\nanother in front of him just betwixt him and the water; an axe gleamed\r\nbright in the moon, and he caught a great stroke on his target, and\r\ntherewith drave his left shoulder straight forward, so that the man\r\nbefore him fell over into the water with a mighty splash; for they were\r\nat the very edge of the deepest eddy of the Water.  Then he spun round on\r\nhis heel, heeding not that another stroke had fallen on his right\r\nshoulder, yet ill-aimed, and not with the full edge, so that it ran down\r\nhis byrny and rent it not.  So he sent the thrust of his spear crashing\r\nthrough the face and skull of the smiter, and looked not to him as he\r\nfell, but stood still, brandishing his spear and crying out, \xe2\x80\x98For the\r\nBurg and the Face!  For the Burg and the Face!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo other foe came against him, but like to the echo of his cry rose a\r\nclear shout not far aloof, \xe2\x80\x98For the Face, for the Face!  For the Burg and\r\nthe Face!\xe2\x80\x99  He muttered, \xe2\x80\x98So ends the day as it begun,\xe2\x80\x99 and shouted loud\r\nagain, \xe2\x80\x98For the Burg and the Face!\xe2\x80\x99  And in a minute more came breaking\r\nforth from the stone-heaps into the moonlit space before the water the\r\ntall shapes of the men of Burgstead, the red torchlight and the moonlight\r\nflashing back from their war-gear and weapons; for every man had his\r\nsword or spear in hand.\r\n\r\nHall-face was the first of them, and he threw his arms about his brother\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Well met, Gold-mane, though thou comest amongst us like\r\nStone-fist of the Mountain.  Art thou hurt?  With whom hast thou dealt?\r\nWhere be they?  Whence comest thou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, I am not hurt,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.  \xe2\x80\x98Stint thy questions then, till\r\nthou hast told me whom thou seekest with spear and sword and candle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two felons were they,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hall-face, \xe2\x80\x98even such as ye saw lying dead\r\nat Wood-grey\xe2\x80\x99s the other day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then may ye sheathe your swords and go home,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane, \xe2\x80\x98for one\r\nlieth at the bottom of the eddy, and the other, thy feet are well-nigh\r\ntreading on him, Hall-face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen arose a rumour of praise and victory, and they brought the torches\r\nnigh and looked at the fallen man, and found that he was stark dead; so\r\nthey even let him lie there till the morrow, and all turned about toward\r\nthe Thorp; and many looked on Face-of-god and wondered concerning him,\r\nwhence he was and what had befallen him.  Indeed, they would have asked\r\nhim thereof, but could not get at him to ask; but whoso could, went as\r\nnigh to Hall-face and him as they might, to hearken to the talk between\r\nthe brothers.\r\n\r\nSo as they went along Hall-face did verily ask him whence he came: \xe2\x80\x98For\r\nwas it not so,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98that thou didst enter into the wood seeking\r\nsome adventure early in the morning the day before yesterday?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sooth is that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98and I came to Shadowy Vale, and\r\nthence am I come this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Hall-face: \xe2\x80\x98I know not Shadowy Vale, nor doth any of us.  This is a\r\nnew word.  How say ye, friends, doth any man here know of Shadowy Vale?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey all said, \xe2\x80\x98Nay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen said Hall-face: \xe2\x80\x98Hast thou been amongst mere ghosts and marvels,\r\nbrother, or cometh this tale of thy minstrelsy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For all your words,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane, \xe2\x80\x98to that Vale have I been; and, to\r\nspeak shortly (for I desire to have your tale, and am waiting for it), I\r\nwill tell thee that I found there no marvels or strange wights, but a\r\nfolk of valiant men; a folk small in numbers, but great of heart; a folk\r\ncome, as we be, from the Fathers and the Gods.  And this, moreover, is to\r\nbe said of them, that they are the foes of these felons of whom ye were\r\nchasing these twain.  And these same Dusky Men of Silver-dale would slay\r\nthem every man if they might; and if we look not to it they will soon be\r\ndoing the same by us; for they are many, and as venomous as adders, as\r\nfierce as bears, and as foul as swine.  But these valiant men, who bear\r\non their banner the image of the Wolf, should be our fellows in arms, and\r\nthey have good will thereto; and they shall show us the way to\r\nSilver-dale by blind paths, so that we may fall upon these felons while\r\nthey dwell there tormenting the poor people of the land, and thus may we\r\ndestroy them as lads a hornet\xe2\x80\x99s nest.  Or else the days shall be hard for\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe men who hung about them drank in his words greedily.  But Hall-face\r\nwas silent a little while, and then he said: \xe2\x80\x98Brother Gold-mane, these be\r\ngreat tidings.  Time was when we might have deemed them but a minstrel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntale; for Silver-dale we know not, of which thou speakest so glibly, nor\r\nthe Dusky Men, any more than the Shadowy Vale.  Howbeit, things have\r\nbefallen these two last days so strange and new, that putting them\r\ntogether with the murder at Wood-grey\xe2\x80\x99s, and thy words which seem\r\nsomewhat wild, it may well seem to us that tidings unlooked for are\r\ncoming our way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98give me what thou hast in thy scrip, and\r\ntrust me, I shall not jeer at thy tale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Hall-face: \xe2\x80\x98I also will be short with the tale; and that the more,\r\nas meseemeth it is not yet done, and that thou thyself shalt share in the\r\nending of it.  It was the day before yesterday, that is the day when thou\r\ndepartedst into the woods on that adventure whereof thou shalt one day\r\ntell me more, wilt thou not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, in good time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Hall-face, \xe2\x80\x98we went into the woods that day and in the\r\nmorning, but after sunrise, to the number of a score: we looked to meet a\r\nbear and a she-bear with cubs in a certain place; for one of the\r\nWoodlanders, a keen hunter, had told us of their lair.  Also we were\r\nwishful to slay some of the wild-swine, the yearlings, if we might.\r\nTherefore, though we had no helms or shields or coats of fence, we had\r\nbowshot a plenty, and good store of casting-weapons, besides our\r\nwood-knives and an axe or so; and some of us, of whom I was one, bore our\r\nbattle-swords, as we are wont ever to do, be the foe beast or man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thus armed we went up Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way and came to Carlstead, where\r\nhalf-a-score Woodlanders joined themselves to us, so that we became a\r\nband.  We went up the half-cleared places past Carlstead for a mile, and\r\nthen turned east into the wood, and went I know not how far, for the\r\nWoodlanders led us by crooked paths, but two hours wore away in our\r\ngoing, till we came to the place where they looked to find the bears.  It\r\nis a place that may well be noted, for it is unlike the wood round about.\r\nThere is a close thicket some two furlongs about of thorn and briar and\r\nill-grown ash and oak and other trees, planted by the birds belike; and\r\nit stands as it were in an island amidst of a wide-spreading woodlawn of\r\nfine turf, set about in the most goodly fashion with great tall\r\nstraight-boled oak-trees, that seem to have been planted of set purpose\r\nby man\xe2\x80\x99s hand.  Yea, dost thou know the place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Methinks I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane, \xe2\x80\x98and I seem to have heard the\r\nWoodlanders give it a name and call it Boars-bait.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That may be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hall-face.  \xe2\x80\x98Well, there we were, the dogs and the\r\nmen, and we drew nigh the thicket and beset it, and doubted not to find\r\nprey therein: but when we would set the dogs at the thicket to enter it,\r\nthey were uneasy, and would not take up the slot, but growled and turned\r\nabout this way and that, so that we deemed that they winded some fierce\r\nbeast at our flanks or backs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even so it was, and fierce enough and deadly was the beast; for suddenly\r\nwe heard bow-strings twang, and shafts came flying; and Iron-shield of\r\nthe Upper Dale, who was close beside me, leapt up into the air and fell\r\ndown dead with an arrow through his back.  Then I bethought me in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, and I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cThe foe are on us! take the cover\r\nof the tree-boles and be wary!  For the Burg and the Face!  For the Burg\r\nand the Face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So we scattered and covered ourselves with the oak-boles, but besides\r\nIron-shield, who was slain outright, two goodmen were sorely hurt, to wit\r\nBald-face, a man of our house, and Stonyford of the Lower Dale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I looked from behind my tree-bole, a great one; and far off down the\r\nglades I saw men moving, clad in gay raiment; but nearer to me, not a\r\nhundred yards from my cover, I saw an arm clad in scarlet come out from\r\nbehind a tree-bole, so I loosed at it, and missed not; for straight there\r\ntottered out from behind the tree one of those dusky foul-favoured men\r\nlike to those that were slain by Wood-grey.  I had another shaft ready\r\nnotched, so I loosed and set the shaft in his throat, and he fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Straightway was a yelling and howling about us like the cries of scalded\r\ncurs, and the oak-wood swarmed thick with these felons rushing on us; for\r\nit seems that the man whom I had slain was a chief amongst them, or we\r\njudged so by his goodly raiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Methought then our last day was come.  What could we do but run together\r\nagain after we had loosed at a venture, and so withstand them sword and\r\nspear in hand?  Some fell beneath our shot, but not many, for they came\r\non very swiftly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So they fell on us; but for all their fierceness and their numbers they\r\nmight not break our array, and we slew four and hurt many by sword-hewing\r\nand spear-casting and push of spear; and five of us were hurt and one\r\nslain by their dart-casting.  So they drew off from us a little, and\r\nstrove to spread out and fall to shooting at us again; but this we would\r\nnot suffer, but pushed on as they fell back, keeping as close together as\r\nwe might for the trees.  For we said that we would all die together if\r\nneeds must; and verily the stour was hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet hearken!  In that nick of time rose up a strange cry not far from\r\nus, Ha! ha! ha! ha!  How-ow-ow! ending like the howl of a wolf, and then\r\nanother and another and another, till the whole wood rang again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At first we deemed that here were come fresh foemen, and that we were\r\nundone indeed; but when they heard it, the foe-men before us faltered and\r\ngave way, and at last turned their backs and fled, and we followed,\r\nkeeping well together still: thereby the more part of these men escaped\r\nus, for they fled wildly here and there from those who bore that cry with\r\nthem; so we knew that our work was being done for us; therefore we stood,\r\nand saw tall men clad in sheep-brown weed running through the glades\r\npursuing those felons and smiting them down, till both fleers and\r\npursuers passed out of our sight like men in a dream, or as when ye roll\r\nup a pictured cloth to lay it in the coffer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But to Stone-face\xe2\x80\x99s mind those brown-clad men were the Wights of the\r\nWood that be of the Fathers\xe2\x80\x99 blood, and our very friends; and when some\r\nof us would yet have gone forward and foregathered with them, and\r\nfollowed the chase along with them, Stone-face gainsaid it, bidding us\r\nnot to run into the arms of a second death, when we had but just escaped\r\nfrom the first.  Sooth to say, moreover, we had divers hurt men that\r\nneeded looking to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So what with one thing, what with another, we turned back: but\r\nWar-cliff\xe2\x80\x99s brother, a tall man, had felled two of those felons with an\r\noak sapling which he had torn from the thicket; but he had not slain\r\nthem, and by now they were just awakening from their swoon, and were\r\nsitting up looking round them with fierce rolling eyes, expecting the\r\nstroke, for Raven of Longscree was standing over them with a naked\r\nwar-sword in his hand.  But now that our blood was cool, we were loth to\r\nslay them as they lay in our hands; so we bound them and brought them\r\naway with us; and our own dead we carried also on such biers as we might\r\nlightly make there, and with them three that were so grievously hurt that\r\nthey might not go afoot, these we left at Carlstead: they were Tardy the\r\nSon of the Untamed, and Swan of Bull-meadow, both of the Lower Dale, and\r\na Woodlander, Undoomed to wit.  But the dead were Iron-shield aforesaid,\r\nand Wool-sark, and the Hewer, a Woodlander.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So came we sadly at eventide to Burgstead with the two dead Burgdalers,\r\nand the captive felons, and the wounded of us that might go afoot; and ye\r\nmay judge that they of Burgdale and our father deemed these tidings great\r\nenough, and wotted not what next should befall.  Stone-face would have\r\nhad those two felons slain there and then; for no true tale could we get\r\nout of them, nor indeed any word at all.  But the Alderman would not have\r\nit so; and he deemed they might serve our turn as hostages if any of our\r\nfolk should be taken: for one and all we deemed, and still deem, that war\r\nis on us and that new folk have gathered on our skirts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So the captives were shut up in the red out-bower of our house; and our\r\nfather was minded that thou mightest tell us somewhat of them when thou\r\nwert come home.  But about dusk to-day the word went that they had broken\r\nout and gotten them weapons and fled up the Dale; and so it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But to-morrow morning will a Gate-thing be holden, and there it will be\r\nlooked for of thee that thou tell us a true tale of thy goings.  For it\r\nis deemed, and it is my deeming especially, that thou may\xe2\x80\x99st tell us more\r\nof these men than thou hast yet told us.  Is it not so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gold-mane, \xe2\x80\x98I can make as many words as ye will about\r\nit; yet when all is said, it will come to much the same tale as I have\r\nalready told thee.  Yet belike, if ye are minded to take up the sword to\r\ndefend you, I may tell you in what wise to lay hold on the hilts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that is well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hall-face, \xe2\x80\x98and no less do I look for of thee.\r\nBut lo! here are we come to the Gate of the Burg that abideth battle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.  TALK IN THE HALL OF THE HOUSE OF THE FACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN sooth they were come to the very Gate of Burgstead, and the great\r\ngates were shut, and only a wicket was open, and a half score of stout\r\nmen in all their war-gear were holding ward thereby.  They gave place to\r\nHall-face and his company, albeit some of the warders followed them\r\nthrough the wicket that they might hear the story told.\r\n\r\nThe street was full of folk, both men and women, talking together eagerly\r\nconcerning all these tidings, and when they saw the men of the\r\nHue-and-cry they came thronging about them, so that they might scarce get\r\nto the door of the House of the Face because of the press; so Hall-face\r\n(who was a very tall man) cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good people, all is well! the runaways are slain, and Face-of-god is\r\ncome back with us; give place a little, that we may come into our house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the throng set up a shout, and made way a little, so that Hall-face\r\nand Gold-mane and the others could get to the door.  And they entered\r\ninto the Hall, and saw much folk therein; and men were sitting at table,\r\nfor supper was not yet over.  But when they saw the new-comers they\r\nmostly rose up from the board and stood silent to hear the tale, for they\r\nhad been talking many together each to each, so that the Hall was full of\r\nconfused noise.\r\n\r\nSo Hall-face again cried out: \xe2\x80\x98Men in this hall, good is the tidings.\r\nThe runaways are slain; and it was Face-of-god who slew them as he came\r\nback safe from the waste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen they shouted for joy, and the brethren and Stone-face with them (for\r\nhe had entered with them from the street) went up on to the da\xc3\xafs, while\r\nthe others of the Hue-and-cry gat them seats where they might at the\r\nendlong tables.\r\n\r\nBut when Face-of-god came up on to the da\xc3\xafs, there sat Iron-face looking\r\ndown on the thronged Hall with a ruddy cheerful countenance, and beside\r\nhim sat the Bride; for he had caused her to be brought thither when he\r\nhad heard of the tidings of battle.  She was daintily clad in a\r\nflame-coloured kirtle embroidered with gold about the bosom and sleeves,\r\nand there was a fillet of golden roses on her ruddy hair.  Her eyes shone\r\nbright and eager, and the pommels of her cheeks were flushed and red\r\ncontrary to their wont.  Needs must Gold-mane sit by her, and when he\r\ncame close to her he knew not what to do, but he put forth his hand to\r\nher, yet with a troubled countenance; for he feared her grief mingled\r\nwith her beauty: as for her, she wavered in her mind whether she should\r\nforbear to touch him or not; but she saw that men about were looking at\r\nthem, and especially was Iron-face looking on her: therefore she stood up\r\nand took Gold-mane\xe2\x80\x99s hand and kissed his face as she had been wont to do,\r\nand by then was her face as white as paper; and her anguish pierced his\r\nheart, so that he well-nigh groaned for grief of her.  But Iron-face\r\nlooked on her and said kindly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kinswoman, thou art pale; thou hast feared for thy mate amidst all these\r\ntidings of war, and still fearest for him.  But pluck up a heart; for the\r\nman is a deft warrior for all his fair face, which thou lovest as a woman\r\nshould, and his hands may yet save his head.  And if he be slain, yet are\r\nthere other men of the kindred, and the earth will not be a desert to\r\nthee even then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at Iron-face, and the colour was come back to her face\r\nsomewhat, and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is true; I have feared for him; for he goeth into perilous places.\r\nBut for thee, thou art kind, and I thank thee for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd therewith she kissed Iron-face and sat down in her place, and strove\r\nto overmaster her grief, that her face might not be changed by it; for\r\nnow were thoughts of battle, and valiant hopes arising in men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts;\r\nand it seemed to her too grievous if she should mar that feast on the eve\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\nBut Iron-face kissed and embraced his son and said: \xe2\x80\x98Art thou late come\r\nfrom the waste?  Hast thou seen new things?  We look to have a notable\r\ntale from thee; though here also have been tidings, and it is not unlike\r\nthat we shall presently have new work on our hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98I deem that when thou hast heard my tale\r\nthou wilt think no less of it than that there are valiant folk to be\r\nholpen, poor folk to be delivered, and evil folk to be swept from off the\r\nface of the earth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well, son,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face.  \xe2\x80\x98I see that thy tale is long; let it\r\nalone for to-night.  To-morrow shall we hold a Gate-thing, and then shall\r\nwe hear all that thou hast to tell.  Now eat thy meat and drink a bowl of\r\nwine, and comfort thy troth-plight maiden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Gold-mane sat down by the Bride, and ate and drank as he needs must;\r\nbut he was ill at ease and he durst not speak to her.  For, on the one\r\nhand, he thought concerning his love for the Sun-beam, and how sweet and\r\ngood a thing it was that she should take him by the hand and lead him\r\ninto noble deeds and great fame, caressing him so softly and sweetly the\r\nwhile; and, on the other hand, there sat the Bride beside him, sorrowful\r\nand angry, begrudging all that sweetness of love, as though it were\r\nsomething foul and unseemly; and heavy on him lay the weight of that\r\ngrudge, for he was a man of a friendly heart.\r\n\r\nStone-face sat outward from him on the other side of the Bride; and he\r\nleaned across her towards Gold-mane and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fair shall be thy tale to-morrow, if thou tellest us all thine\r\nadventure.  Or wilt thou tell us less than all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98In good time shalt thou know it all, foster-father;\r\nbut it is not unlike that by the time that thou hast heard it, there\r\nshall be so many other things to tell of, that my tale shall seem of\r\nlittle account to thee\xe2\x80\x94even as the saw saith that one nail driveth out\r\nthe other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98but one tale belike shall be knit up with the\r\nothers, as it fareth with the figures that come one after other on the\r\nweaver\xe2\x80\x99s cloth; though one maketh not the other, yet one cometh of the\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Wise art thou now, foster-father, but thou shalt be\r\nwiser yet in this matter by then a month hath worn: and to-morrow shalt\r\nthou know enough to set thine hands a-work.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the talk fell between them; and the night wore, and the men of\r\nBurgdale feasted in their ancient hall with merry hearts, little weighed\r\ndown by thought of the battle that might be and the trouble to come; for\r\nthey were valorous and kindly folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.  FACE-OF-GOD GIVETH THAT TOKEN TO THE BRIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW on the morrow, when Face-of-god arose and other men with him, and the\r\nHall was astir and there was no little throng therein, the Bride came up\r\nto him; for she had slept in the House of the Face by the bidding of the\r\nAlderman; and she spake to him before all men, and bade him come forth\r\nwith her into the garden, because she would speak to him apart.  He\r\nyeasaid her, though with a heavy heart; and to the folk about that seemed\r\nmeet and due, since those twain were deemed to be troth-plight, and they\r\nsmiled kindly on them as they went out of the Hall together.\r\n\r\nSo they came into the garden, where the pear-trees were blossoming over\r\nthe spring lilies, and the cherries were showering their flowers on the\r\ndeep green grass, and everything smelled sweetly on the warm windless\r\nspring morning.\r\n\r\nShe led the way, going before him till they came by a smooth grass path\r\nbetween the berry bushes, to a square space of grass about which were\r\nbarberry trees, their first tender leaves bright green in the sun against\r\nthe dry yellowish twigs.  There was a sundial amidmost of the grass, and\r\nbetwixt the garden-boughs one could see the long grey roof of the ancient\r\nhall; and sweet familiar sounds of the nesting birds and men and women\r\ngoing on their errands were all about in the scented air.  She turned\r\nabout at the sundial and faced Face-of-god, her hand lightly laid on the\r\nscored brass, and spake with no anger in her voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ask thee if thou hast brought me the token whereon thou shalt swear to\r\ngive me that gift.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; and therewith drew the ring from his bosom, and held it\r\nout to her.  She reached out her hand to him slowly and took it, and\r\ntheir fingers met as she did so, and he noted that her hand was warm and\r\nfirm and wholesome as he well remembered it.\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Whence hadst thou this fair finger-ring?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98My friend there in the mountain-valley drew it from\r\noff her finger for thee, and bade me bear thee a message.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer face flushed red: \xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and doth she send me a message?\r\nThen doth she know of me, and ye have talked of me together.  Well, give\r\nthe message!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98She saith, that thou shalt bear in mind, That\r\nto-morrow is a new day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98for her it is so, and for thee; but not for me.  But\r\nnow I have brought thee here that thou mightest swear thine oath to me;\r\nlay thine hand on this ring and on this brazen plate whereby the sun\r\nmeasures the hours of the day for happy folk, and swear by the\r\nspring-tide of the year and all glad things that find a mate, and by the\r\nGod of the Earth that rejoiceth in the life of man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he laid his hand on the finger-ring as it lay on the dial-plate and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the spring-tide and the live things that long to multiply their kind;\r\nby the God of the Earth that rejoiceth in the life of man, I swear to\r\ngive to my kinswoman the Bride the second man-child that I beget; to be\r\nhers, to leave or cherish, to love or hate, as her will may bid her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen he looked on her soberly and said: \xe2\x80\x98It is duly sworn; is it enough?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; but he saw how the tears ran out of her eyes and wetted\r\nthe bosom of her kirtle, and she hung her head for shame of her grief.\r\nAnd Gold-mane was all abashed, and had no word to say; for he knew that\r\nno word of his might comfort her; and he deemed it ill done to stay there\r\nand behold her sorrow; and he knew not how to get him gone, and be glad\r\nelsewhere, and leave her alone.\r\n\r\nThen, as if she had read his thought, she looked up at him and said\r\nsmiling a little amidst of her tears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I bid thee stay by me till the flood is over; for I have yet a word to\r\nsay to thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he stood there gazing down on the grass in his turn, and not daring to\r\nraise his eyes to her face, and the minutes seemed long to him: till at\r\nlast she said in a voice scarcely yet clear of weeping:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wilt thou say anything to me, and tell me what thou hast done, and why,\r\nand what thou deemest will come of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98I will tell the truth as I know it, because thou askest it of\r\nme, and not because I would excuse myself before thee.  What have I done?\r\nYesterday I plighted my troth to wed the woman that I met last autumn in\r\nthe wood.  And why?  I wot not why, but that I longed for her.  Yet I\r\nmust tell thee that it seemed to me, and yet seemeth, that I might do no\r\notherwise\xe2\x80\x94that there was nothing else in the world for me to do.  What do\r\nI deem will come of it, sayest thou?  This, that we shall be happy\r\ntogether, she and I, till the day of our death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98And even so long shall I be sorry: so far are we sundered now.\r\nAlas! who looked for it?  And whither shall I turn to now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98She bade me tell thee that to-morrow is a new day:\r\nmeseemeth I know her meaning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No word of hers hath any meaning to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Bride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but hast thou not heard these rumours of war that are in\r\nthe Dale?  Shall not these things avail thee?  Much may grow out of them;\r\nand thou with the mighty heart, so faithful and compassionate!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98What sayest thou?  What may grow out of them?  Yea, I have\r\nheard those rumours as a man sick to death heareth men talk of their\r\nbusiness down in the street while he lieth on his bed; and already he\r\nhath done with it all, and hath no world to mend or mar.  For me nought\r\nshall grow out of it.  What meanest thou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Gold-mane: \xe2\x80\x98Is there nought in the fellowship of Folks, and the\r\naiding of the valiant, and the deliverance of the hapless?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98there is nought to me.  I cannot think of it to-day nor\r\nyet to-morrow belike.  Yet true it is that I may mingle in it, though\r\nthinking nought of it.  But this shall not avail me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was silent a little, but presently spake and said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou sayest\r\nright; it is not thou that hast done this, but the woman who sent me the\r\nring and the message of an old saw.  O that she should be born to sunder\r\nus!  How hath it befallen that I am now so little to thee and she so\r\nmuch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd again she was silent; and after a while Face-of-god spake kindly and\r\nsoftly and said: \xe2\x80\x98Kinswoman, wilt thou for ever begrudge our love? this\r\ngrudge lieth heavy on my soul, and it is I alone that have to bear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98This is but a light burden for thee to bear, when thou hast\r\nnought else to bear!  But do I begrudge thee thy love, Gold-mane?  I know\r\nnot that.  Rather meseemeth I do not believe in it\xe2\x80\x94nor shall do ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she held her peace a long while, nor did he speak one word: and they\r\nwere so still, that a robin came hopping about them, close to the hem of\r\nher kirtle, and a starling pitched in the apple-tree hard by and whistled\r\nand chuckled, turning about and about, heeding them nought.  Then at last\r\nshe lifted up her face from looking on the grass and said: \xe2\x80\x98These are\r\nidle words and avail nothing: one thing only I know, that we are\r\nsundered.  And now it repenteth me that I have shown thee my tears and my\r\ngrief and my sickness of the earth and those that dwell thereon.  I am\r\nashamed of it, as if thou hadst smitten me, and I had come and shown thee\r\nthe stripes, and said, See what thou hast done! hast thou no pity?  Yea,\r\nthou pitiest me, and wilt try to forget thy pity.  Belike thou art right\r\nwhen thou sayest, To-morrow is a new day; belike matters will arise that\r\nwill call me back to life, and I shall once more take heed of the joy and\r\nsorrow of my people.  Nay, it is most like that this I shall feign to do\r\neven now.  But if to-morrow be a new day, it is to-day now and not\r\nto-morrow, and so shall it be for long.  Hereof belike we shall talk no\r\nmore, thou and I.  For as the days wear, the dealings between us shall be\r\nthat thou shalt but get thee away from my life, and I shall be nought to\r\nthee but the name of a kinswoman.  Thus should it be even wert thou to\r\nstrive to make it otherwise; and thou shalt _not_ strive.  So let all\r\nthis be; for this is not the word I had to say to thee.  But hearken! now\r\nare we sundered, and it irketh me beyond measure that folk know it not,\r\nand are kind, and rejoice in our love, and deem it a happy thing for the\r\nfolk; and this burden I may bear no longer.  So I shall declare unto men\r\nthat I will not wed thee; and belike they may wonder why it is, till they\r\nsee thee wedded to the Woman of the Mountain.  Art thou content that so\r\nit shall be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, thou shalt not take this all upon thyself; I also\r\nshall declare unto the Folk that I will wed none but her, the\r\nMountain-Woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98This shalt thou not do; I forbid it thee.  And I _will_ take\r\nit all upon myself.  Shall I have it said of me that I am unmeet to wed\r\nthee, and that thou hast found me out at last and at latest?  I lay this\r\nupon thee, that wheresoever I declare this and whatsoever I may say, thou\r\nshalt hold thy peace.  This at least thou may\xe2\x80\x99st do for me.  Wilt thou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98though it shall put me to shame.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain she was silent for a little; then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Gold-mane, this would I take upon myself not soothly for any shame of\r\nseeming to be thy cast-off; but because it is I who needs must bear all\r\nthe sorrow of our sundering; and I have the will to bear it greater and\r\nheavier, that I may be as the women of old time, and they that have come\r\nfrom the Gods, lest I belittle my life with malice and spite and\r\nconfusion, and it become poisonous to me.  Be at peace! be at peace!  And\r\nleave all to the wearing of the years; and forget not that which thou\r\nhast sworn!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she turned and went from that green place toward the House of\r\nthe Face, walking slowly through the garden amongst the sweet odours,\r\nbeneath the fair blossoms, a body most dainty and beauteous of fashion,\r\nbut the casket of grievous sorrow, which all that goodliness availed not.\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god lingered in that place a little, and for that little\r\nwhile the joy of his life was dulled and overworn; and the days before\r\nhis wandering on the mountain seemed to him free and careless and happy\r\ndays that he could not but regret.  He was ashamed, moreover, that this\r\nso unquenchable grief should come but of him, and the pleasure of his\r\nlife, which he himself had found out for himself, and which was but such\r\na little portion of the Earth and the deeds thereof.  But presently his\r\nthought wandered from all this, and as he turned away from the sundial\r\nand went his ways through the garden, he called to mind his longing for\r\nthe day of the spring market, when he should see the Sun-beam again and\r\nbe cherished by the sweetness of her love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.  OF THE GATE-THING AT BURGSTEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT now must he hasten, for the Gate-thing was to be holden two hours\r\nbefore noon; so he betook him speedily to the Hall, and took his shield\r\nand did on a goodly helm and girt his sword to his side, for men must\r\nneeds go to all folk-motes with their weapons and clad in war-gear.  Thus\r\nhe went forth to the Gate with many others, and there already were many\r\nfolk assembled in the space aforesaid betwixt the Gate of the Burg and\r\nthe sheer rocks on the face of which were the steps that led up to the\r\nancient Tower on the height.  The Alderman was sitting on the great stone\r\nby the Gate-side which was his appointed place, and beside him on the\r\nstone bench were the six Wardens of the Burg; but of the six Wardens of\r\nthe Dale there were but three, for the others had not yet heard tell of\r\nthe battle or had got the summons to the Thing, since they had been about\r\ntheir business down the Dale.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god took his place silently amongst the neighbours, but men made\r\nway for him, so that he must needs stand in front, facing his father and\r\nthe Wardens; and there went up a murmur of expectation round about him,\r\nboth because the word had gone about that he had a tale of new tidings to\r\ntell, and also because men deemed him their best and handiest man, though\r\nhe was yet so young.\r\n\r\nNow the Alderman looked around and beheld a great throng gathered\r\ntogether, and he looked on the shadow of the Gate which the southering\r\nsun was casting on the hard white ground of the Thing-stead, and he saw\r\nthat it had just taken in the standing-stone which was in the midst of\r\nthe place.  On the face of the said stone was carven the image of a\r\nfighting man with shield on arm and axe in hand; for it had been set\r\nthere in old time in memory of the man who had bidden the Folk build the\r\nGate and its wall, and had showed them how to fashion it: for he was a\r\ndeft house-smith as well as a great warrior; and his name was Iron-hand.\r\nSo when the Alderman saw that this stone was wholly within the shadow of\r\nthe Gate he knew that it was the due time for the hallowing-in of the\r\nThing.  So he bade one of the wardens who sat beside him and had a great\r\nslug-horn slung about him, to rise and set the horn to his mouth.\r\n\r\nSo that man arose and blew three great blasts that went bellowing about\r\nthe towers and down the street, and beat back again from the face of the\r\nsheer rocks and up them and over into the wild-wood; and the sound of it\r\nwent on the light west-wind along the lips of the Dale toward the\r\nmountain wastes.  And many a goodman, when he heard the voice of the horn\r\nin the bright spring morning, left spade or axe or plough-stilts, or the\r\nfoddering of the ewes and their younglings, and turned back home to fetch\r\nhis sword and helm and hasten to the Thing, though he knew not why it was\r\nsummoned: and women wending over the meadows, who had not yet heard of\r\nthe battle in the wood, hearkened and stood still on the green grass or\r\namidst the ripples of the ford, and the threat of coming trouble smote\r\nheavy on their hearts, for they knew that great tidings must be towards\r\nif a Thing must needs be summoned so close to the Great Folk-mote.\r\n\r\nBut now the Alderman stood up and spake amidst the silence that followed\r\nthe last echoes of the horn:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now is hallowed in this Gate-thing of the Burgstead Men and the Men of\r\nthe Dale, wherein they shall take counsel concerning matters late\r\nbefallen, that press hard upon them.  Let no man break the peace of the\r\nHoly Thing, lest he become a man accursed in holy places from the plain\r\nup to the mountain, and from the mountain down to the plain; a man not to\r\nbe cherished of any man of good will, not be holpen with victuals or\r\nedge-tool or draught-beast; a man to be sheltered under no roof-tree, and\r\nwarmed at no hearth of man: so help us the Warrior and the God of the\r\nEarth, and Him of the Face, and all the Fathers!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he had spoken men clashed their weapons in token of assent; and he\r\nsat down again, and there was silence for a space.  But presently came\r\nthrusting forward a goodman of the Dale, who seemed as if he had come\r\nhurriedly to the Thing; for his face was running down with sweat, his\r\nwide-rimmed iron cap sat awry over his brow, and he was girt with a rusty\r\nsword without a scabbard, and the girdle was ill-braced up about his\r\nloins.  So he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Red-coat of Waterless of the Lower Dale.  Early this morning as I\r\nwas going afield I met on the way a man akin to me, Fox of Upton to wit,\r\nand he told me that men were being summoned to a Gate-thing.  So I turned\r\nback home, and caught up any weapon that came handy, and here I am,\r\nAlderman, asking thee of the tidings which hath driven thee to call this\r\nThing so hard on the Great Folk-mote, for I know them nothing so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen stood up Iron-face the Alderman and said: \xe2\x80\x98This is well asked, and\r\nsoon shall ye be as wise as I am on this matter.  Know ye, O men of\r\nBurgstead and the Dale, that we had not called this Gate-thing so hard on\r\nthe Great Folk-mote had not great need been to look into troublous\r\nmatters.  Long have ye dwelt in peace, and it is years on years now since\r\nany foeman hath fallen on the Dale: but, as ye will bear in mind, last\r\nautumn were there ransackings in the Dale and amidst of the Shepherds\r\nafter the manner of deeds of war; and it troubleth us that none can say\r\nwho wrought these ill deeds.  Next, but a little while agone, was\r\nWood-grey, a valiant goodman of the Woodlanders, slain close to his own\r\ndoor by evil men.  These men we took at first for mere gangrel felons and\r\noutcasts from their own folk: though there were some who spoke against\r\nthat from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But thirdly are new tidings again: for three days ago, while some of the\r\nfolk were hunting peaceably in the Wild-wood and thinking no evil, they\r\nwere fallen upon of set purpose by a host of men-at-arms, and nought\r\nwould serve but mere battle for dear life, so that many of our neighbours\r\nwere hurt, and three slain outright; and now mark this, that those who\r\nthere fell upon our folk were clad and armed even as the two felons that\r\nslew Wood-grey, and moreover were like them in aspect of body.  Now stand\r\nforth Hall-face my son, and answer to my questions in a loud voice, so\r\nthat all may hear thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Hall-face stood forth, clad in gleaming war-gear, with an axe over his\r\nshoulder, and seemed a doughty warrior.  And Iron-face said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, son, those whom ye met in the wood, and of whom ye brought home\r\ntwo captives, how much like were they to the murder-carles at\r\nWood-grey\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Hall-face: \xe2\x80\x98As like as peas out of the same cod, and to our eyes all\r\nthose whom we saw in the wood might have been sons of one father and one\r\nmother, so much alike were they.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman; \xe2\x80\x98now tell me how many by thy deeming fell upon\r\nyou in the wood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Hall-face: \xe2\x80\x98We deemed that if they were any less than threescore,\r\nthey were little less.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Great was the odds,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman.  \xe2\x80\x98Or how many were ye?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One score and seven,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hall-face.\r\n\r\nSaid the Alderman: \xe2\x80\x98And yet ye escaped with life all save those three?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHall-face said: \xe2\x80\x98I deem that scarce one should have come back alive, had\r\nit not been that as we fought came a noise like the howling of wolves,\r\nand thereat the foemen turned and fled, and there followed on the fleers\r\ntall men clad in sheep-brown raiment, who smote them down as they fled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here then is the story, neighbours,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman, \xe2\x80\x98and ye may see\r\nthereby that if those slayers of Wood-grey were outcast, their band is a\r\ngreat one; but it seemeth rather that they were men of a folk whose craft\r\nit is to rob with the armed hand, and to slay the robbed; and that they\r\nare now gathering on our borders for war.  Yet, moreover, they have\r\nfoemen in the woods who should be fellows-in-arms of us.  How sayest\r\nthou, Stone-face?  Thou art old, and hast seen many wars in the Dale, and\r\nknowest the Wild-wood to its innermost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alderman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98and ye neighbours of the Dale, maybe these\r\nfoes whom ye have met are not of the race of man, but are trolls and\r\nwood-wights.  Now if they be trolls it is ill, for then is the world\r\ngrowing worser, and the wood shall be right perilous for those who needs\r\nmust fare therein.  Yet if they be men it is a worse matter; for the\r\ntrolls would not come out of the waste into the sunlight of the Dale.\r\nBut these foes, if they be men, are lusting after our fair Dale to eat it\r\nup, and it is most like that they are gathering a huge host to fall upon\r\nus at home.  Such things I have heard of when I was young, and the aspect\r\nof the evil men who overran the kindreds of old time, according to all\r\ntales and lays that I have heard, is even such as the aspect of those\r\nwhom we have seen of late.  As to those wolves who saved the neighbours\r\nand chased their foemen, there is one here who belike knoweth more of all\r\nthis than we do, and that, O Alderman, is thy son whom I have fostered,\r\nFace-of-god to wit.  Bid him answer to thy questioning, and tell us what\r\nhe hath seen and heard of late; then shall we verily know the whole story\r\nas far as it can be known.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen men pressed round, and were eager to hear what Face-of-god would be\r\nsaying.  But or ever the Alderman could begin to question him, the throng\r\nwas cloven by new-comers, and these were the men who had been sent to\r\nbring home the corpses of the Dusky Men: so they had cast loaded hooks\r\ninto the Weltering Water, and had dragged up him whom Face-of-god had\r\nshoved into the eddy, and who had sunk like a stone just where he fell,\r\nand now they were bringing him on a bier along with him who had been\r\nslain a-land.  They were set down in the place before the Alderman, and\r\nmen who had not seen them before looked eagerly on them that they might\r\nbehold the aspect of their foemen; and nought lovely were they to look\r\non; for the drowned man was already bleached and swollen with the water,\r\nand the other, his face was all wryed and twisted with that spear-thrust\r\nin the mouth.\r\n\r\nThen the Alderman said: \xe2\x80\x98I would question my son Face-of-god.  Let him\r\nstand forth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd therewith he smiled merrily in his son\xe2\x80\x99s face, for he was standing\r\nright in front of him; and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask of me, Alderman, and I will answer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kinsman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face, \xe2\x80\x98look at these two dead men, and tell me, if\r\nthou hast seen any such besides those two murder-carles who were slain at\r\nCarlstead; or if thou knowest aught of their folk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Yesterday I saw six others like to these both in array\r\nand of body, and three of them I slew, for we were in battle with them\r\nearly in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of joy at this word, since all men took these felons\r\nfor deadly foemen; but Iron-face said: \xe2\x80\x98What meanest thou by \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I and the men who had guested me overnight,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98and they\r\nslew the other three; or rather a woman of them slew the felons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Valiant she was; all good go with her hand!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman.  \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nwhat be these people, and where do they dwell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98As to what they are, they are of the kindred of the\r\nGods and the Fathers, valiant men, and guest-cherishing: rich have they\r\nbeen, and now are poor: and their poverty cometh of these same felons,\r\nwho mastered them by numbers not to be withstood.  As to where they\r\ndwell: when I say the name of their dwelling-place men mock at me, as if\r\nI named some valley in the moon: yet came I to Burgdale thence in one day\r\nacross the mountain-necks led by sure guides, and I tell thee that the\r\nname of their abode is Shadowy Vale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face, \xe2\x80\x98knoweth any man here of Shadowy Vale, or where it\r\nis?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNone answered for a while; but there was an old man who was sitting on\r\nthe shafts of a wain on the outskirts of the throng, and when he heard\r\nthis word he asked his neighbour what the Alderman was saying, and he\r\ntold him.  Then said that elder:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me place; for I have a word to say hereon.\xe2\x80\x99  Therewith he arose,\r\nand made his way to the front of the ring of men, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Alderman,\r\nthou knowest me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face, \xe2\x80\x98thou art called the Fiddle, because of thy sweet\r\nspeech and thy minstrelsy; whereof I mind me well in the time when I was\r\nyoung and thou no longer young.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Fiddle.  \xe2\x80\x98Now hearken!  When I was very young I\r\nheard of a vale lying far away across the mountain-necks; a vale where\r\nthe sun shone never in winter and scantily in summer; for my sworn\r\nfoster-brother, Fight-fain, a bold man and a great hunter, had happened\r\nupon it; and on a day in full midsummer he brought me thither; and even\r\nnow I see the Vale before me as in a picture; a marvellous place, well\r\ngrassed, treeless, narrow, betwixt great cliff-walls of black stone, with\r\na green river running through it towards a yawning gap and a huge force.\r\nAmidst that Vale was a doom-ring of black stones, and nigh thereto a\r\nfeast-hall well builded of the like stones, over whose door was carven\r\nthe image of a wolf with red gaping jaws, and within it (for we entered\r\ninto it) were stone benches on the da\xc3\xafs.  Thence we came away, and\r\nthither again we went in late autumn, and so dusk and cold it was at that\r\nseason, that we knew not what to call it save the valley of deep shade.\r\nBut its real name we never knew; for there was no man there to give us a\r\nname or tell us any tale thereof; but all was waste there; the wimbrel\r\nlaughed across its water, the raven croaked from its crags, the eagle\r\nscreamed over it, and the voices of its waters never ceased; and thus we\r\nleft it.  So the seasons passed, and we went thither no more: for\r\nFight-fain died, and without him wandering over the waste was irksome to\r\nme; so never have I seen that valley again, or heard men tell thereof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, neighbours, have I told you of a valley which seemeth to be Shadowy\r\nVale; and this is true and no made-up story.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Alderman nodded kindly to him, and then said to Face-of-god:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kinsman, is this word according with what thou knowest of Shadowy Vale?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, on all points,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; \xe2\x80\x98he hath put before me a picture\r\nof the valley.  And whereas he saith, that in his youth it was waste,\r\nthis also goeth with my knowledge thereof.  For once was it peopled, and\r\nthen was waste, and now again is it peopled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell us then more of the folk thereof,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman; \xe2\x80\x98are they\r\nmany?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98they are not.  How might they be many, dwelling\r\nin that narrow Vale amid the wastes?  But they are valiant, both men and\r\nwomen, and strong and well-liking.  Once they dwelt in a fair dale called\r\nSilver-dale, the name whereof will be to you as a name in a lay; and\r\nthere were they wealthy and happy.  Then fell upon them this murderous\r\nFolk, whom they call the Dusky Men; and they fought and were overcome,\r\nand many of them were slain, and many enthralled, and the remnant of them\r\nescaped through the passes of the mountains and came back to dwell in\r\nShadowy Vale, where their forefathers had dwelt long and long ago; and\r\nthis overthrow befell them ten years agone.  But now their old foemen\r\nhave broken out from Silver-dale and have taken to scouring the wood\r\nseeking prey; so they fall upon these Dusky Men as occasion serves, and\r\nslay them without pity, as if they were adders or evil dragons; and\r\nindeed they be worse.  And these valiant men know for certain that their\r\nfoemen are now of mind to fall upon this Dale and destroy it, as they\r\nhave done with others nigher to them.  And they will slay our men, and\r\nlie with our women against their will, and enthrall our children, and\r\ntorment all those that lie under their hands till life shall be worse\r\nthan death to them.  Therefore, O Alderman and Wardens, and ye neighbours\r\nall, it behoveth you to take counsel what we shall do, and that\r\nspeedily.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was again a murmur, as of men nothing daunted, but intent on taking\r\nsome way through the coming trouble.  But no man said aught till the\r\nAlderman spake:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When didst thou first happen upon this Earl-folk, son?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Late last autumn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\nSaid Iron-face: \xe2\x80\x98Then mightest thou have told us of this tale before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said his son, \xe2\x80\x98but I knew it not, or but little of it, till two\r\ndays agone.  In the autumn I wandered in the woodland, and on the fell I\r\nhappened on a few of this folk dwelling in a booth by the pine-wood; and\r\nthey were kind and guest-fain with me, and gave me meat and drink and\r\nlodging, and bade me come to Shadowy Vale in the spring, when I should\r\nknow more of them.  And that was I fain of; for they are wise and goodly\r\nmen.  But I deemed no more of those that I saw there save as men who had\r\nbeen outlawed by their own folk for deeds that were unlawful belike, but\r\nnot shameful, and were biding their time of return, and were living as\r\nthey might meanwhile.  But of the whole Folk and their foemen knew I no\r\nmore than ye did, till two days agone, when I met them again in Shadowy\r\nVale.  Also I think before long ye shall see their chieftain in\r\nBurgstead, for he hath a word for us.  Lastly, my mind it is that those\r\nbrown-clad men who helped Hall-face and his company in the wood were\r\nnought but men of this Earl-kin seeking their foemen; for indeed they\r\ntold me that they had come upon a battle in the woodland wherein they had\r\nslain their foemen.  Now have I told you all that ye need to know\r\nconcerning these matters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain was there silence as Iron-face sat pondering a question for his\r\nson; then a goodman of the Upper Dale, Gritgarth to wit, spake and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane mine, tell us how many is this folk; I mean their\r\nfighting-men?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well asked, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face.\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Their fighting-men of full age may be five score; but\r\nbesides that there shall be some two or three score of women that will\r\nfight, whoever says them nay; and many of these are little worse in the\r\nfield than men; or no worse, for they shoot well in the bow.  Moreover,\r\nthere will be a full score of swains not yet twenty winters old whom ye\r\nmay not hinder to fight if anything is a-doing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is no great host,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman; \xe2\x80\x98yet if they deem there is\r\nlittle to lose by fighting, and nought to gain by sitting still, they may\r\ngo far in winning their desire; and that more especially if they may draw\r\ninto their quarrel some other valiant Folk more in number than they be.\r\nI marvel not, though, they were kind to thee, son Gold-mane, if they knew\r\nwho thou wert.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They knew it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neighbours,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman, \xe2\x80\x98have ye any rede hereon, and aught to\r\nsay to back your rede?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen spake the Fiddle: \xe2\x80\x98As ye know and may see, I am now very old, and,\r\nas the word goes, unmeet for battle: yet might I get me to the field,\r\neither on mine own legs or on the legs of some four-foot beast, I would\r\nstrike, if it were but one stroke, on these pests of the earth.  And,\r\nAlderman, meseemeth we shall do amiss if we bid not the Earl-folk of\r\nShadowy Vale to be our fellows in arms in this adventure.  For look you,\r\nhow few soever they be, they will be sure to know the ways of our foemen,\r\nand the mountain passes, and the surest and nighest roads across the\r\nnecks and the mires of the waste; and though they be not a host, yet\r\nshall they be worth a host to us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen men heard his words they shouted for joy of them; for hatred of the\r\nDusky Men who should so mar their happy life in the Dale was growing up\r\nin them, and the more that hatred waxed, the more waxed their love of\r\nthose valiant ones.\r\n\r\nNow Red-coat of Waterless spake again: he was a big man, both tall and\r\nbroad, ruddy-faced and red-haired, some forty winters old.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Life hath been well with us of the Lower Dale, and we deem that we have\r\nmuch to lose in losing it.  Yet ill would the bargain be to buy life with\r\nthralldom: we have been over-merry hitherto for that.  Therefore I say,\r\nto battle!  And as to these men, these well-wishers of Face-of-god, if\r\nthey also are minded for battle with our foes, we were fools indeed if we\r\ndid not join them to our company, were they but one score instead of\r\nsix.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMen shouted again, and they said that Red-coat had spoken well.  Then one\r\nafter other the goodmen of the Dale came and gave their word for\r\nfellowship in arms with the Men of Shadowy Vale, if there were such as\r\nFace-of-god had said, which they doubted not; and amongst them that spake\r\nwere Fox of Nethertown, and Warwell, and Gritgarth, and Bearswain, and\r\nWarcliff, and Hart of Highcliff, and Worm of Willowholm, and Bullsbane,\r\nand Highneb of the Marsh: all these were stout men-at-arms and men of\r\ngood counsel.\r\n\r\nLast of all the Alderman spake and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to the war, that must we needs meet if all be sooth that we have\r\nheard, and I doubt it not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now therefore let us look to it like wise men while time yet serves.  Ye\r\nshall know that the muster of the Dalesmen will bring under shield eight\r\nlong hundreds of men well-armed, and of the Shepherd-Folk four hundreds,\r\nand of the Woodlanders two hundreds; and this is a goodly host if it be\r\nwell ordered and wisely led.  Now am I your Alderman and your Doomster,\r\nand I can heave up a sword as well as another maybe, nor do I think that\r\nI shall blench in the battle; yet I misdoubt me that I am no leader or\r\norderer of men-of-war: therefore ye will do wisely to choose a wiser\r\nman-at-arms than I be for your War-leader; and if at the Great Folk-mote,\r\nwhen all the Houses and Kindreds are gathered, men yeasay your choosing,\r\nthen let him abide; but if they naysay it, let him give place to another.\r\nFor time presses.  Will ye so choose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, yea!\xe2\x80\x99 cried all men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good is that, neighbours,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman.  \xe2\x80\x98Whom will ye have for\r\nWar-leader?  Consider well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShort was their rede, for every man opened his mouth and cried out\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Face-of-god!\xe2\x80\x99  Then said the Alderman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man is young and untried; yet though he is so near akin to me, I\r\nwill say that ye will do wisely to take him; for he is both deft of his\r\nhands and brisk; and moreover, of this matter he knoweth more than all we\r\ntogether.  Now therefore I declare him your War-leader till the time of\r\nthe Great Folk-mote.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen all men shouted with great glee and clashed their weapons; but some\r\nfew put their heads together and spake apart a little while, and then one\r\nof them, Red-coat of Waterless to wit, came forward and said: \xe2\x80\x98Alderman,\r\nsome of us deem it good that Stone-face, the old man wise in war and in\r\nthe ways of the Wood, should be named as a counsellor to the War-leader;\r\nand Hall-face, a very brisk and strong young man, to be his right hand\r\nand sword-bearer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good is that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face.  \xe2\x80\x98Neighbours, will ye have it so?\xe2\x80\x99  This\r\nalso they yeasaid without delay, and the Alderman declared Stone-face and\r\nHall-face the helpers of Face-of-god in this business.  Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If any hath aught to say concerning what is best to be done at once, it\r\nwere good that he said it now before all and not to murmur and grudge\r\nhereafter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNone spake save the Fiddle, who said: \xe2\x80\x98Alderman and War-leader, one thing\r\nwould I say: that if these foemen are anywise akin to those overrunners\r\nof the Folks of whom the tales went in my youth (for I also as well as\r\nStone-face mind me well of those tales concerning them), it shall not\r\navail us to sit still and await their onset.  For then may they not be\r\nwithstood, when they have gathered head and burst out and over the folk\r\nthat have been happy, even as the waters that overtop a dyke and cover\r\nwith their muddy ruin the deep green grass and the flower-buds of spring.\r\nTherefore my rede is, as soon as may be to go seek these folk in the\r\nwoodland and wheresoever else they may be wandering.  What sayest thou,\r\nFace-of-god?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My rede is as thine,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98and to begin with, I do now call upon\r\nten tens of good men to meet me in arms at the beginning of Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nWay to-morrow morning at daybreak; and I bid my brother Hall-face to\r\nsummon such as are most meet thereto.  For this I deem good, that we\r\nscour the wood daily at present till we hear fresh tidings from them of\r\nShadowy Vale, who are nigher than we to the foemen.  Now, neighbours, are\r\nye ready to meet me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen all shouted, \xe2\x80\x98Yea, we will go, we will go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the Alderman: \xe2\x80\x98Now have we made provision for the war in that which\r\nis nearest to our hands.  Yet have we to deal with the matter of the\r\nfellowship with the Folk whom Face-of-god hath seen.  This is a matter\r\nfor thee, son, at least till the Great Folk-mote is holden.  Tell me\r\nthen, shall we send a messenger to Shadowy Vale to speak with this folk,\r\nor shall we abide the chieftain\xe2\x80\x99s coming?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By my rede,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98we shall abide his coming: for first,\r\nthough I might well make my way thither, I doubt if I could give any the\r\nbearings, so that he could come there without me; and belike I am needed\r\nat home, since I am become War-leader.  Moreover, when your messenger\r\ncometh to Shadowy Vale, he may well chance to find neither the chieftain\r\nthere, nor the best of his men; for whiles are they here, and whiles\r\nthere, as they wend following after the Dusky Men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well, son,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman, \xe2\x80\x98let it be as thou sayest: soothly\r\nthis matter must needs be brought before the Great Folk-mote.  Now will I\r\nask if any other hath any word to say, or any rede to give before this\r\nGate-thing sundereth?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut no man came forward, and all men seemed well content and of good\r\nheart; and it was now well past noontide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.  THE ENDING OF THE GATE-THING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT just as the Alderman was on the point of rising to declare the\r\nbreaking-up of the Thing, there came a stir in the throng and it opened,\r\nand a warrior came forth into the innermost of the ring of men, arrayed\r\nin goodly glittering War-gear; clad in such wise that a tunicle of\r\nprecious gold-wrought web covered the hauberk all but the sleeves\r\nthereof, and the hem of it beset with blue mountain-stones smote against\r\nthe ankles and well-nigh touched the feet, shod with sandals\r\ngold-embroidered and gemmed.  This warrior bore a goodly gilded helm on\r\nthe head, and held in hand a spear with gold-garlanded shaft, and was\r\ngirt with a sword whose hilts and scabbard both were adorned with gold\r\nand gems: beardless, smooth-cheeked, exceeding fair of face was the\r\nwarrior, but pale and somewhat haggard-eyed: and those who were nearby\r\nbeheld and wondered; for they saw that there was come the Bride arrayed\r\nfor war and battle, as if she were a messenger from the House of the\r\nGods, and the Burg that endureth for ever.\r\n\r\nThen she fell to speech in a voice which at first was somewhat hoarse and\r\nbroken, but cleared as she went on, and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There sittest thou, O Alderman of Burgdale!  Is Face-of-god thy son\r\nanywhere nigh, so that he can hear me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Iron-face wondered at her word, and said: \xe2\x80\x98He is beside thee, as he\r\nshould be.\xe2\x80\x99  For indeed Face-of-god was touching her, shoulder to\r\nshoulder.  But she looked not to the right hand nor the left, but said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hearken, Iron-face!  Chief of the House of the Face, Alderman of the\r\nDale, and ye also, neighbours and goodmen of the Dale: I am a woman\r\ncalled the Bride, of the House of the Steer, and ye have heard that I\r\nhave plighted my troth to Face-of-god to wed with him, to love him, and\r\nlie in his bed.  But it is not so: we are not troth-plight; nor will I\r\nwed with him, nor any other, but will wend with you to the war, and play\r\nmy part therein according to what might is in me; nor will I be worser\r\nthan the wives of Shadowy Vale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god heard her words with no change of countenance; but Iron-face\r\nreddened over all his face, and stared at her, and knit his brows and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Maiden, what are these words?  What have we done to thee?  Have I not\r\nbeen to thee as a father, and loved thee dearly?  Is not my son goodly\r\nand manly and deft in arms?  Hath it not ever been the wont of the House\r\nof the Face to wed in the House of the Steer? and in these two Houses\r\nthere hath never yet been a goodlier man and a lovelier maiden than are\r\nye two.  What have we done then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye have done nought against me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and all that thou sayest is\r\nsooth; yet will I not wed with Face-of-god.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet fiercer waxed the face of the Alderman, and he said in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how if I tell thee that I will speak with thy kindred of the Steer,\r\nand thou shalt do after my bidding whether thou wilt or whether thou wilt\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how will ye compel me thereto?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98Are there thralls in the\r\nDale?  Or will ye make me an outlaw?  Who shall heed it?  Or I shall\r\nbetake me to Shadowy Vale and become one of their warrior-maidens.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow was the Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s face changing from red to white, and belike he\r\nforgat the Thing, and what he was doing there, and he cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is an evil day, and who shall help me?  Thou, Face-of-god, what\r\nhast thou to say?  Wilt thou let this woman go without a word?  What hath\r\nbewitched thee?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut never a word spake his son, but stood looking straight forward, cold\r\nand calm by seeming.  Then turned Iron-face again to the Bride, and said\r\nin a softer voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, maiden, whom I erst called daughter, what hath befallen, that\r\nthou wilt leave my son; thou who wert once so kind and loving to him;\r\nwhose hand was always seeking his, whose eyes were ever following his;\r\nwho wouldst go where he bade, and come when he called.  What hath betid\r\nthat ye have cast him out, and flee from our House?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe flushed red beneath her helm and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is war in the land, and I have seen it coming, and that things\r\nshall change around us.  I have looked about me and seen men happy and\r\nwomen content, and children weary for mere mirth and joy.  And I have\r\nthought, in a day, or two days or three, all this shall be changed, and\r\nthe women shall be, some anxious and wearied with waiting, some casting\r\nall hope away; and the men, some shall come back to the garth no more,\r\nand some shall come back maimed and useless, and there shall be loss of\r\nfriends and fellows, and mirth departed, and dull days and empty hours,\r\nand the children wandering about marvelling at the sorrow of the house.\r\nAll this I saw before me, and grief and pain and wounding and death; and\r\nI said: Shall I be any better than the worst of the folk that loveth me?\r\nNay, this shall never be; and since I have learned to be deft with mine\r\nhands in all the play of war, and that I am as strong as many a man, and\r\nas hardy-hearted as any, I will give myself to the Warrior and the God of\r\nthe Face; and the battle-field shall be my home, and the after-grief of\r\nthe fight my banquet and holiday, that I may bear the burden of my\r\npeople, in the battle and out of it; and know every sorrow that the Dale\r\nhath; and cast aside as a grievous and ugly thing the bed of the warrior\r\nthat the maiden desires, and the toying of lips and hands and soft words\r\nof desire, and all the joy that dwelleth in the Castle of Love and the\r\nGarden thereof; while the world outside is sick and sorry, and the fields\r\nlie waste and the harvest burneth.  Even so have I sworn, even so will I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer eyes glittered and her cheek was flushed, and her voice was clear and\r\nringing now; and when she ended there arose a murmur of praise from the\r\nmen round about her.  But Iron-face said coldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These are great words; but I know not what they mean.  If thou wilt to\r\nthe field and fight among the carles (and that I would not naysay, for it\r\nhath oft been done and praised aforetime), why shouldest thou not go side\r\nby side with Face-of-god and as his plighted maiden?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe light which the sweetness of speech had brought into her face had\r\ndied out of it now, and she looked weary and hapless as she answered him\r\nslowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not wed with Face-of-god, but will fare afield as a virgin of\r\nwar, as I have sworn to the Warrior.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen waxed Iron-face exceeding wroth, and he rose up before all men and\r\ncried loudly and fiercely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is some lie abroad, that windeth about us as the gossamers in the\r\nlanes of an autumn morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd therewith he strode up to Face-of-god as though he had nought to do\r\nwith the Thing; and he stood before him and cried out at him while all\r\nmen wondered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou! what hast thou done to turn this maiden\xe2\x80\x99s heart to stone?  Who is\r\nit that is devising guile with thee to throw aside this worthy wedding in\r\na worthy House, with whom our sons are ever wont to wed?  Speak, tell the\r\ntale!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god held his peace and stood calm and proud before all men.\r\n\r\nThen the blood mounted to Iron-face\xe2\x80\x99s head, and he forgat folk and\r\nkindred and the war to come, and he cried so that all the place rang with\r\nthe words of his anger:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou dastard!  I see thee now; it is thou that hast done this, and not\r\nthe maiden; and now thou hast made her bear a double burden, and set her\r\non to speak for thee, whilst thou standest by saying nought, and wilt\r\ntake no scruple\xe2\x80\x99s weight of her shame upon thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut his son spake never a word, and Iron-face cried: \xe2\x80\x98Out on thee!  I\r\nknow thee now, and why thou wouldest not to the West-land last winter.  I\r\nam no fool; I know thee.  Where hast thou hidden the stranger woman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he drew forth his sword and hove it aloft as if to hew down\r\nFace-of-god, who spake not nor flinched nor raised a hand from his side.\r\nBut the Bride threw herself in front of Gold-mane, while there arose an\r\nangry cry of \xe2\x80\x98The Peace of the Holy Thing!  Peace-breaking,\r\npeace-breaking!\xe2\x80\x99 and some cried, \xe2\x80\x98For the War-leader, the War-leader!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand as men could for the press they drew forth their swords, and there\r\nwas tumult and noise all over the Thing-stead.\r\n\r\nBut Stone-face caught hold of the Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s right arm and dragged down\r\nthe sword, and the big carle, Red-coat of Waterless, came up behind him\r\nand cast his arms about his middle and drew him back; and presently he\r\nlooked around him, and slowly sheathed his sword, and went back to his\r\nplace and sat him down; and in a little while the noise abated and swords\r\nwere sheathed, and men waxed quiet again, and the Alderman arose and said\r\nin a loud voice, but in the wonted way of the head man of the Thing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here hath been trouble in the Holy Thing; a violent man hath troubled\r\nit, and drawn sword on a neighbour; will the neighbours give the dooming\r\nhereof into the hands of the Alderman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow all knew Iron-face, and they cried out, \xe2\x80\x98That will we.\xe2\x80\x99  So he spake\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I doom the troubler of the Peace of the Holy Thing to pay a fine, to wit\r\ndouble the blood-wite that would be duly paid for a full-grown freeman of\r\nthe kindreds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the cry went up and men yeasaid his doom, and all said that it was\r\nwell and fairly doomed; and Iron-face sat still.\r\n\r\nBut Stone-face stood forth and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here have been wild words in the air; and dreams have taken shape and\r\ncome amongst us, and have bewitched us, so that friends and kin have\r\nwrangled.  And meseemeth that this is through the wizardry of these\r\nfelons, who, even dead as they are, have cast spells over us.  Good it\r\nwere to cast them into the Death Tarn, and then to get to our work; for\r\nthere is much to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll men yeasaid that; and Forkbeard of Lea went with those who had borne\r\nthe corpses thither to cast them into the black pool.\r\n\r\nBut the Fiddle spake and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stone-face sayeth sooth.  O Alderman, thou art no young man, yet am I\r\nold enough to be thy father; so will I give thee a rede, and say this:\r\nFace-of-god thy son is no liar or dastard or beguiler, but he is a young\r\nman and exceeding goodly of fashion, well-spoken and kind; so that few\r\nwomen may look on him and hear him without desiring his kindness and\r\nlove, and to such men as this many things happen.  Moreover, he hath now\r\nbecome our captain, and is a deft warrior with his hands, and as I deem,\r\na sober and careful leader of men; therefore we need him and his courage\r\nand his skill of leading.  So rage not against him as if he had done an\r\nill deed not to be forgiven\xe2\x80\x94whatever he hath done, whereof we know\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94for life is long before him, and most like we shall still have to\r\nthank him for many good deeds towards us.  As for the maiden, she is both\r\nlovely and wise.  She hath a sorrow at her heart, and we deem that we\r\nknow what it is.  Yet hath she not lied when she said that she would bear\r\nthe burden of the griefs of the people.  Even so shall she do; and\r\nwhether she will, or whether she will not, that shall heal her own\r\ngriefs.  For to-morrow is a new day.  Therefore, if thou do after my\r\nrede, thou wilt not meddle betwixt these twain, but wilt remember all\r\nthat we have to do, and that war is coming upon us.  And when that is\r\nover, we shall turn round and behold each other, and see that we are not\r\nwholly what we were before; and then shall that which were hard to\r\nforgive, be forgotten, and that which is remembered be easy to forgive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he spake; and Iron-face sat still and put his left hand to his beard\r\nas one who pondereth; but the Bride looked in the face of the old man the\r\nFiddle, and then she turned and looked at Gold-mane, and her face\r\nsoftened, and she stood before the Alderman, and bent down before him and\r\nheld out both her hands to him the palms upward.  Then she said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou\r\nhast been wroth with me, and I marvel not; for thy hope, and the hope\r\nwhich we all had, hath deceived thee.  But kind indeed hast thou been to\r\nme ere now: therefore I pray thee take it not amiss if I call to thy mind\r\nthe oath which thou swearedst on the Holy Boar last Yule, that thou\r\nwouldst not gainsay the prayer of any man if thou couldest perform it;\r\ntherefore I bid thee naysay not mine: and that is, that thou wilt ask me\r\nno more about this matter, but wilt suffer me to fare afield like any\r\nswain of the Dale, and to deal so with my folk that they shall not hinder\r\nme.  Also I pray thee that thou wilt put no shame upon Face-of-god my\r\nplaymate and my kinsman, nor show thine anger to him openly, even if for\r\na little while thy love for him be abated.  No more than this will I ask\r\nof thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll men who heard her were moved to the heart by her kindness and the\r\nsweetness of her voice, which was like to the robin singing suddenly on a\r\nfrosty morning of early winter.  But as for Gold-mane, his heart was\r\nsmitten sorely by it, and her sorrow and her friendliness grieved him out\r\nof measure.\r\n\r\nBut Iron-face answered after a little while, speaking slowly and\r\nhoarsely, and with the shame yet clinging to him of a man who has been\r\nwroth and has speedily let his wrath run off him.  So he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well, my daughter.  I have no will to forswear myself; nor hast\r\nthou asked me a thing which is over-hard.  Yet indeed I would that to-day\r\nwere yesterday, or that many days were worn away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he stood up and cried in a loud voice over the throng:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let none forget the muster; but hold him ready against the time that the\r\nWarden shall come to him.  Let all men obey the War-leader, Face-of-god,\r\nwithout question or delay.  As to the fine of the peace-breaker, it shall\r\nbe laid on the altar of the God at the Great Folk-mote.  Herewith is the\r\nThing broken up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen all men shouted and clashed their weapons, and so sundered, and went\r\nabout their business.\r\n\r\nAnd the talk of men it was that the breaking of the troth-plight between\r\nthose twain was ill; for they loved Face-of-god, and as for the Bride\r\nthey deemed her the Dearest of the kindreds and the Jewel of the Folk,\r\nand as if she were the fairest and the kindest of all the Gods.  Neither\r\ndid the wrath of Iron-face mislike any; but they said he had done well\r\nand manly both to be wroth and to let his wrath run off him.  As to the\r\nwar which was to come, they kept a good heart about it, and deemed it as\r\na game to be played, wherein they might show themselves deft and valiant,\r\nand so get back to their merry life again.\r\n\r\nSo wore the day through afternoon to even and night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.  FACE-OF-GOD LEADETH A BAND THROUGH THE WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEXT morning tryst was held faithfully, and an hundred and a half were\r\ngathered together on Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way; and Face-of-god ordered them into\r\nthree companies.  He made Hall-face leader over the first one, and bade\r\nhim hold on his way northward, and then to make for Boars-bait and see if\r\nhe should meet with anything thereabout where the battle had been.\r\nRed-coat of Waterless he made captain of the second band; and he had it\r\nin charge to wend eastward along the edge of the Dale, and not to go deep\r\ninto the wood, but to go as far as he might within the time appointed,\r\ntoward the Mountains.  Furthermore, he bade both Hall-face and Red-coat\r\nto bring their bands back to Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way by the morrow at sunset,\r\nwhere other goodmen should be come to take the places of their men; and\r\nthen if he and his company were back again, he would bid them further\r\nwhat to do; but if not, as seemed likely, then Hall-face\xe2\x80\x99s band to go\r\nwest toward the Shepherd country half a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, and so back, and\r\nRed-coat\xe2\x80\x99s east along the Dale\xe2\x80\x99s lip again for the like time, and then\r\nback, so that there might be a constant watch and ward of the Dale kept\r\nagainst the Felons.\r\n\r\nAll being ordered Gold-mane led his own company north-east through the\r\nthick wood, thinking that he might so fare as to come nigh to\r\nSilver-dale, or at least to hear tidings thereof.  This intent he told to\r\nStone-face, but the old man shook his head and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good is this if it may be done; but it is not for everyone to go down to\r\nHell in his lifetime and come back safe with a tale thereof.  However,\r\nwhither thou wilt lead, thither will I follow, though assured death\r\nwaylayeth us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd the old carle was joyous and proud to be on this adventure, and said,\r\nthat it was good indeed that his foster-son had with him a man well\r\nstricken in years, who had both seen many things, and learned many, and\r\nhad good rede to give to valiant men.\r\n\r\nSo they went on their ways, and fared very warily when they were gotten\r\nbeyond those parts of the wood which they knew well.  By this time they\r\nwere strung out in a long line; and they noted their road carefully,\r\nblazing the trees on either side when there were trees, and piling up\r\nlittle stone-heaps where the trees failed them.  For Stone-face said that\r\noft it befell men amidst the thicket and the waste to be misled by wights\r\nthat begrudged men their lives, so that they went round and round in a\r\nring which they might not depart from till they died; and no man doubted\r\nhis word herein.\r\n\r\nAll day they went, and met no foe, nay, no man at all; nought but the\r\nwild things of the wood; and that day the wood changed little about them\r\nfrom mile to mile.  There were many thickets across their road which they\r\nhad to go round about; so that to the crow flying over the tree-tops the\r\njourney had not been long to the place where night came upon them, and\r\nwhere they had to make the wood their bedchamber.\r\n\r\nThat night they lighted no fire, but ate such cold victual as they might\r\ncarry with them; nor had they shot any venison, since they had with them\r\nmore than enough; they made little noise or stir therefore and fell\r\nasleep when they had set the watch.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow they arose betimes, and broke their fast and went their\r\nways till noon: by then the wood had thinned somewhat, and there was\r\nlittle underwood betwixt the scrubby oak and ash which were pretty nigh\r\nall the trees about: the ground also was broken, and here and there\r\nrocky, and they went into and out of rough little dales, most of which\r\nhad in them a brook of water running west and southwest; and now\r\nFace-of-god led his men somewhat more easterly; and still for some while\r\nthey met no man.\r\n\r\nAt last, about four hours after noon, when they were going less warily,\r\nbecause they had hitherto come across nothing to hinder them, rising over\r\nthe brow of a somewhat steep ridge, they saw down in the valley below\r\nthem a half score of men sitting by the brook-side eating and drinking,\r\ntheir weapons lying beside them, and along with them stood a woman with\r\nher hands tied behind her back.\r\n\r\nThey saw at once that these men were of the Felons, so they that had\r\ntheir bows bent, loosed at them without more ado, while the others ran in\r\nupon them with sword and spear.  The felons leapt up and ran scattering\r\ndown the dale, such of them as were not smitten by the shafts; but he who\r\nwas nighest to the woman, ere he ran, turned and caught up a sword from\r\nthe ground and thrust it through her, and the next moment fell across the\r\nbrook with an arrow in his back.\r\n\r\nNo one of the felons was nimble enough to escape from the fleet-foot\r\nhunters of Burgdale, and they were all slain there to the number of\r\neleven.\r\n\r\nBut when they came back to the woman to tend her, she breathed her last\r\nin their hands: she was a young and fair woman, black-haired and\r\ndark-eyed.  She had on her body a gown of rich web, but nought else: she\r\nhad been bruised and sore mishandled, and the Burgdale carles wept for\r\npity of her, and for wrath, as they straightened her limbs on the turf of\r\nthe little valley.  They let her lie there a little, whilst they searched\r\nround about, lest there should be any other poor soul needing their help,\r\nor any felon lurking thereby; but they found nought else save a bundle\r\nwherein was another rich gown and divers woman\xe2\x80\x99s gear, and sundry rings\r\nand jewels, and therewithal the weapons and war-gear of a knight,\r\ndelicately wrought after the Westland fashion: these seemed to them to\r\nbetoken other foul deeds of these murder-carles.  So when they had abided\r\na while, they laid the dead woman in mould by the brook-side, and buried\r\nwith her the other woman\xe2\x80\x99s attire and the knight\xe2\x80\x99s gear, all but his\r\nsword and shield, which they had away with them: then they cast the\r\ncarcasses of the felons into the brake, but brought away their weapons\r\nand the silver rings from their arms, which they wore like all the others\r\nof them whom they had fallen in with; and so went on their way to the\r\nnorth-east, full of wrath against those dastards of the Earth.\r\n\r\nIt was hard on sunset when they left the valley of murder, and they went\r\nno long way thence before they must needs make stay for the night; and\r\nwhen they had arrayed their sleeping-stead the moon was up, and they saw\r\nthat before them lay the close wood again, for they had made their lair\r\non the top of a little ridge.\r\n\r\nThere then they lay, and nought stirred them in the night, and betimes on\r\nthe morrow they were afoot, and entered the abovesaid thicket, wherein\r\ntwo of them, keen hunters, had been aforetime, but had not gone deep into\r\nit.  Through this wood they went all day toward the north-east, and met\r\nnought but the wild things therein.  At last, when it was near sunset,\r\nthey came out of the thicket into a small plain, or shallow dale rather,\r\nwith no great trees in it, but thorn-brakes here and there where the\r\nground sank into hollows; a little river ran through the midst of it, and\r\nwinded round about a height whose face toward the river went down sheer\r\ninto the water, but away from it sank down in a long slope to where the\r\nthick wood began again: and this height or burg looked well-nigh west.\r\n\r\nThitherward they went; but as they were drawing nigh to the river, and\r\nwere on the top of a bent above a bushy hollow between them and the\r\nwater, they espied a man standing in the river near the bank, who saw\r\nthem not, because he was stooping down intent on something in the bank or\r\nunder it: so they gat them speedily down into the hollow without noise,\r\nthat they might get some tidings of the man.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god bade his men abide hidden under the bushes and stole\r\nforward quietly up the further bank of the hollow, his target on his arm\r\nand his spear poised.  When he was behind the last bush on the top of the\r\nbent he was within half a spear-cast of the water and the man; so he\r\nlooked on him and saw that he was quite naked except for a clout about\r\nhis middle.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god saw at once that he was not one of the Dusky Men; he was a\r\nblack-haired man, but white-skinned, and of fair stature, though not so\r\ntall as the Burgdale folk.  He was busied in tickling trouts, and just as\r\nFace-of-god came out from the bush into the westering sunlight, he threw\r\nup a fish on to the bank, and looked up therewithal, and beheld the\r\nweaponed man glittering, and uttered a cry, but fled not when he saw the\r\nspear poised for casting.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god spake to him and said: \xe2\x80\x98Come hither, Woodsman! we will\r\nnot harm thee, but we desire speech of thee: and it will not avail thee\r\nto flee, since I have bowmen of the best in the hollow yonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man put forth his hands towards him as if praying him to forbear\r\ncasting, and looked at him hard, and then came dripping from out the\r\nwater, and seemed not greatly afeard; for he stooped down and picked up\r\nthe trouts he had taken, and came towards Face-of-god stringing the\r\nlast-caught one through the gills on to the withy whereon were the\r\nothers: and Face-of-god saw that he was a goodly man of some thirty\r\nwinters.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god looked on him with friendly eyes and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Art thou a foemen? or wilt thou be helpful to us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe answered in the speech of the kindreds with the hoarse voice of a much\r\nweather-beaten man:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou seest, lord, that I am naked and unarmed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet may\xe2\x80\x99st thou bewray us,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.  \xe2\x80\x98What man art thou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the man: \xe2\x80\x98I am the runaway thrall of evil men; I have fled from\r\nRose-dale and the Dusky Men.  Hast thou the heart to hurt me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are the foemen of the Dusky Men,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-God; \xe2\x80\x98wilt thou help\r\nus against them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man knit his brows and said: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, if ye will give me your word not\r\nto suffer me to fall into their hands alive.  But whence art thou, to be\r\nso bold?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98We are of Burgdale; and I will swear to thee on the\r\nedge of the sword that thou shalt not fall alive into the hands of the\r\nDusky Men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of Burgdale have I heard,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man; \xe2\x80\x98and in sooth thou seemest not\r\nsuch a man as would bewray a hapless man.  But now had I best bring you\r\nto some lurking-place where ye shall not be easily found of these devils,\r\nwho now oft-times scour the woods hereabout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Come first and see my fellows; and then if thou\r\nthinkest we have need to hide, it is well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the man went side by side with him towards their lair, and as they\r\nwent Gold-mane noted marks of stripes on his back and sides, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sorely hast thou been mishandled, poor man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the man turned on him and said somewhat fiercely: \xe2\x80\x98Said I not that I\r\nhad been a thrall of the Dusky Men? how then should I have escaped\r\ntormenting and scourging, if I had been with them for but three days?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spake they came about a thorn-bush, and there were the Burgdale men\r\ndown in the hollow; and the man said: \xe2\x80\x98Are these thy fellows?  Call to\r\nmind that thou hast sworn by the edge of the sword not to hurt me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor man!\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god; \xe2\x80\x98these are thy friends, unless thou\r\nbewrayest us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he cried aloud to his folk: \xe2\x80\x98Here is now a good hap! this is a\r\nrunaway thrall of the Dusky Men; of him shall we hear tidings; so cherish\r\nhim all ye may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the carles thronged about him and bestirred themselves to help him,\r\nand one gave him his surcoat for a kirtle, and another cast a cloak about\r\nhim; and they brought him meat and drink, such as they had ready to hand:\r\nand the man looked as if he scarce believed in all this, but deemed\r\nhimself to be in a dream.  But presently he turned to Face-of-god and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I see so many men and weapons I deem that ye have no need to skulk\r\nin caves to-night, though I know of good ones: yet shall ye do well not\r\nto light a fire till moon-setting; for the flame ye may lightly hide, but\r\nthe smoke may be seen from far aloof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut they bade him to meat, and he needed no second bidding but ate\r\nlustily, and they gave him wine, and he drank a great draught and sighed\r\nas for joy.  Then he said in a trembling voice, as though he feared a\r\nnaysay:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If ye are from Burgdale ye shall be faring back again presently; and I\r\npray you to take me with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Yea surely, friend, that will we do, and rejoice in\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he drank another cup which Warcliff held out to him, and spake\r\nagain: \xe2\x80\x98Yet if ye would abide here till about noon to-morrow, or\r\nmayhappen a little later, I would bring other runaways to see you; and\r\nthem also might ye take with you: ye may think when ye see them that ye\r\nshall have small gain of their company; for poor wretched folk they be,\r\nlike to myself.  Yet since ye seek for tidings, herein might they do you\r\nmore service than I; for amongst them are some who came out of the\r\nhapless Dale within this moon; and it is six months since I escaped.\r\nMoreover, though they may look spent and outworn now, yet if ye give them\r\na little rest, and feed them well, they shall yet do many a day\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nfor you: and I tell you that if ye take them for thralls, and put collars\r\non their necks, and use them no worse than a goodman useth his oxen and\r\nhis asses, beating them not save when they are idle or at fault, it shall\r\nbe to them as if they were come to heaven out of hell, and to such\r\ngoodhap as they have not thought of, save in dreams, for many and many a\r\nday.  And thus I entreat you to do because ye seem to me to be happy and\r\nmerciful men, who will not begrudge us this happiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe carles of Burgdale listened eagerly to what he said, and they looked\r\nat him with great eyes and marvelled; and their hearts were moved with\r\npity towards him; and Stone-face said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Herein, O War-leader, need I give thee no rede, for thou mayst see\r\nclearly that all we deem that we should lose our manhood and become the\r\ndastards of the Warrior if we did not abide the coming of these poor men,\r\nand take them back to the Dale, and cherish them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wolf of Whitegarth, \xe2\x80\x98and great thanks we owe to this man that\r\nhe biddeth us this: for great will be the gain to us if we become so like\r\nthe Gods that we may deliver the poor from misery.  Now must I needs\r\nthink how they shall wonder when they come to Burgdale and find out how\r\nhappy it is to dwell there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98thus shall we do, whatever cometh of it.\r\nBut, friend of the wood, as to thralls, there be none such in the Dale,\r\nbut therein are all men friends and neighbours, and even so shall ye be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he fell a-musing, when he bethought him of how little he had known of\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nBut that man, when he beheld the happy faces of the Burgdalers, and\r\nhearkened to their friendly voices, and understood what they said, and he\r\nalso was become strong with the meat and drink, he bowed his head adown\r\nand wept a long while; and they meddled not with him, till he turned\r\nagain to them and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since ye are in arms, and seem to be seeking your foemen, I suppose ye\r\nwot that these tyrants and man-quellers will fall upon you in Burgdale\r\nere the summer is well worn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much we deem indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98but we were fain to hear the\r\ncertainty of it, and how thou knowest thereof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the man: \xe2\x80\x98It was six moons ago that I fled, as I have told you; and\r\neven then it was the common talk amongst our masters that there were fair\r\ndales to the south which they would overrun.  Man would say to man: We\r\nwere over many in Silver-dale, and we needed more thralls, because those\r\nwe had were lessening, and especially the women; now are we more at ease\r\nin Rose-dale, though we have sent thralls to Silver-dale; but yet we can\r\nbear no more men from thence to eat up our stock from us: let them fare\r\nsouth to the happy dales, and conquer them, and we will go with them and\r\nhelp therein, whether we come back to Rose-dale or no.  Such talk did I\r\nhear then with mine own ears: but some of those whom I shall bring to you\r\nto-morrow shall know better what is doing, since they have fled from\r\nRose-dale but a few days.  Moreover, there is a man and a woman who have\r\nfled from Silver-dale itself, and are but a month from it, journeying all\r\nthe time save when they must needs hide; and these say that their masters\r\nhave got to know the way to Burgdale, and are minded for it before the\r\nwinter, as I said; and nought else but the ways thither do they desire to\r\nknow, since they have no fear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy then was night come, and though the moon was high in heaven, and\r\nlighted all that waste, the Burgdalers must needs light a fire for\r\ncooking their meat, whatsoever that woodsman might say; moreover, the\r\nnight was cold and somewhat frosty.  A little before they had come to\r\nthat place they had shot a fat buck and some smaller deer, but of other\r\nmeat they had no great store, though there was wine enough.  So they lit\r\ntheir fire in the thickest of the thorn-bush to hide it all they might,\r\nand thereat they cooked their venison and the trouts which the runaway\r\nhad taken, and they fell to, and ate and drank and were merry, making\r\nmuch of that poor man till him-seemed he was gotten into the company of\r\nthe kindest of the Gods.\r\n\r\nBut when they were full, Face-of-god spake to him, and asked him his\r\nname; and he named himself Dallach; but said he: \xe2\x80\x98Lord, this is according\r\nto the naming of men in Rose-dale before we were enthralled: but now what\r\nnames have thralls?  Also I am not altogether of the blood of them of\r\nRose-dale, but of better and more warrior-like kin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Thou hast named Silver-dale; knowest thou it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDallach answered: \xe2\x80\x98I have never seen it.  It is far hence; in a week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njourney, making all diligence, and not being forced to hide and skulk\r\nlike those runaways, ye shall come to the mouth thereof lying west, where\r\nits rock-walls fall off toward the plain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98is there no other way into that Dale?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, none that folk wot of,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dallach, \xe2\x80\x98except to bold cragsmen with\r\ntheir lives in their hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Knowest thou aught of the affairs of Silver-dale?\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\nSaid Dallach: \xe2\x80\x98Somewhat I know: we wot that but a few years ago there was\r\na valiant folk dwelling therein, who were lords of the whole dale, and\r\nthat they were vanquished by the Dusky Men: but whether they were all\r\nslain and enthralled we wot not; but we deem it otherwise.  As for me it\r\nis of their blood that I am partly come; for my father\xe2\x80\x99s father came\r\nthence to settle in Rose-dale, and wedded a woman of the Dale, who was my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When was it that ye fell under the Dusky Men?\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\nSaid Dallach: \xe2\x80\x98It was five years ago.  They came into the Dale a great\r\ncompany, all in arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was there battle betwixt you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alas! not so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dallach.  \xe2\x80\x98We were a happy folk there; but soft and\r\ndelicate: for the Dale is exceeding fertile, and beareth wealth in\r\nabundance, both corn and oil and wine and fruit, and of beasts for man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice the best that may be.  Would that there had been battle, and that\r\nI had died therein with those that had a heart to fight; and even so\r\nsaith now every man, yea, every woman in the Dale.  But it was not so\r\nwhen the elders met in our Council-House on the day when the Dusky Men\r\nbade us pay them tribute and give them houses to dwell in and lands to\r\nlive by.  Then had we weapons in our hands, but no hearts to use them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What befell then?\xe2\x80\x99 said the goodman of Whitegarth.\r\n\r\nSaid Dallach: \xe2\x80\x98Look ye to it, lords, that it befall not in Burgdale!  We\r\ngave them all they asked for, and deemed we had much left.  What befell,\r\nsayst thou?  We sat quiet; we went about our work in fear and trembling,\r\nfor grim and hideous were they to look on.  At first they meddled not\r\nmuch with us, save to take from our houses what they would of meat and\r\ndrink, or raiment, or plenishing.  And all this we deemed we might bear,\r\nand that we needed no more than to toil a little more each day so as to\r\nwin somewhat more of wealth.  But soon we found that it would not be so;\r\nfor they had no mind to till the teeming earth or work in the acres we\r\nhad given them, or to sit at the loom, or hammer in the stithy, or do any\r\nmanlike work; it was we that must do all that for their behoof, and it\r\nwas altogether for them that we laboured, and nought for ourselves; and\r\nour bodies were only so much our own as they were needful to be kept\r\nalive for labour.  Herein were our tasks harder than the toil of any\r\nmules or asses, save for the younger and goodlier of the women, whom they\r\nwould keep fair and delicate to be their bed-thralls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet not even so were our bodies safe from their malice: for these men\r\nwere not only tyrants, but fools and madmen.  Let alone that there were\r\nfew days without stripes and torments to satiate their fury or their\r\npleasure, so that in all streets and nigh any house might you hear\r\nwailing and screaming and groaning; but moreover, though a wise man would\r\nnot willingly slay his own thrall any more than his own horse or ox, yet\r\ndid these men so wax in folly and malice, that they would often hew at\r\nman or woman as they met them in the way from mere grimness of soul; and\r\nif they slew them it was well.  Thereof indeed came quarrels enough\r\nbetwixt master and master, for they are much given to man-slaying amongst\r\nthemselves: but what profit to us thereof?  Nay, if the dead man were a\r\nchieftain, then woe betide the thralls! for thereof must many an one be\r\nslain on his grave-mound to serve him on the hell-road.  To be short: we\r\nhave heard of men who be fierce, and men who be grim; but these we may\r\nscarce believe us to be men at all, but trolls rather; and ill will it be\r\nif their race waxeth in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Burgdale men hearkened with all their ears, and wondered that such\r\nthings could befall; and they rejoiced at the work that lay before them,\r\nand their hearts rose high at the thought of battle in that behalf, and\r\nthe fame that should come of it.  As for the runaway, they made so much\r\nof him that the man marvelled; for they dealt with him like a woman\r\ncherishing a son, and knew not how to be kind enough to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.  THE MEN OF BURGDALE MEET THE RUNAWAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW ere the night was far spent, Dallach arose and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kind folk, ye will presently be sleeping; but I bid you keep a good\r\nwatch, and if ye will be ruled by me, ye will kindle no fire on the\r\nmorrow, for the smoke riseth thick in the morning air, and is as a\r\nbeacon.  As for me, I shall leave you here to rest, and I myself will\r\nfare on mine errand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey bade him sleep and rest him after so many toils and hardships,\r\nsaying that they were not tied to an hour to be back in Burgdale; but he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, the moon is high, and it is as good as daylight to me, who\r\ncould find my way even by starlight; and your tarrying here is nowise\r\nsafe.  Moreover, if I could find those folk and bring them part of the\r\nway by night and cloud it were well; for if we were taken again, burning\r\nquick would be the best death by which we should die.  As for me, now am\r\nI strong with meat and drink and hope; and when I come to Burgdale there\r\nwill be time enough for resting and slumber.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Shall I not wend with thee to see these people and the\r\nlairs wherein they hide?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man smiled: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, earl,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98that shall not be.  For wot ye\r\nwhat?  If they were to see me in company of a man-at-arms they would deem\r\nthat I was bringing the foe upon them, and would flee, or mayhappen would\r\nfall upon us.  For as for me, when I saw thee, thou wert close anigh me,\r\nso I knew thee to be no Dusky Man; but they would see the glitter of\r\nthine arms from afar, and to them all weaponed men are foemen.  Thou,\r\nlord, knowest not the heart of a thrall, nor the fear and doubt that is\r\nin it.  Nay, I myself must cast off these clothes that ye have given me,\r\nand fare naked, lest they mistrust me.  Only I will take a spear in my\r\nhand, and sling a knife round my neck, if ye will give them to me; for if\r\nthe worst happen, I will not be taken alive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he cast off his raiment, and they gave him the weapons and\r\nwished him good speed, and he went his way twixt moonlight and shadow;\r\nbut the Burgdalers went to sleep when they had set a watch.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning they awoke, and the sun was shining and the thrushes\r\nsinging in the thorn-brake, and all seemed fair and peaceful, and a\r\nlittle haze still hung about the face of the burg over the river.  So\r\nthey went down to the water and washed the night from off them; and\r\nthence the most part of them went back to their lair among the\r\nthorn-bushes: but four of them went up the dale into the oak-wood to\r\nshoot a buck, and five more they sent out to watch their skirts around\r\nthem; and Face-of-god with old Stone-face went over a ford of the stream,\r\nand came on to the lower slope of the burg, and so went up it to the top.\r\nThence they looked about to see if aught were stirring, but they saw\r\nlittle save the waste and the wood, which on the north-east was thick of\r\nbig trees stretching out a long way.  Their own lair was clear to see\r\nover its bank and the bushes thereof, and that misliked Face-of-god, lest\r\nany foe should climb the burg that day.  The morning was clear, and\r\nFace-of-god looking north-and-by-west deemed he saw smoke rising into the\r\nair over the tree-covered ridges that hid the further distance toward\r\nthat a\xc3\xadrt, though further east uphove the black shoulders of the Great\r\nthat Waste and the snowy peaks behind them.  The said smoke was not such\r\nas cometh from one great fire, but was like a thin veil staining the pale\r\nblue sky, as when men are burning ling on the heath-side and it is seen\r\naloof.\r\n\r\nHe showed that smoke to Stone-face, who smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now will they be lighting the cooking fires in Rose-dale: would I were\r\nthere with a few hundreds of axes and staves at my back!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, smiling in his face, \xe2\x80\x98but where I pray thee are\r\nthese elves and wood-wights, that we meet them not?  Grim things there\r\nare in the woods, and things fair enough also: but meseemeth that the\r\ntrolls and the elves of thy young years have been frighted away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Stone-face: \xe2\x80\x98Maybe, foster-son; that hath been seen ere now, that\r\nwhen one race of man overrunneth the land inhabited by another, the\r\nwights and elves that love the vanquished are seen no more, or get them\r\naway far off into the outermost wilds, where few men ever come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98that may well be.  But deemest thou by that\r\ntoken that we shall be vanquished?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As for us, I know not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face; \xe2\x80\x98but thy friends of Shadowy\r\nVale have been vanquished.  Moreover, concerning these felons whom now we\r\nare hunting, are we all so sure that they be men?  Certain it is, that\r\nwhen I go into battle with them, I shall smite with no more pity than my\r\nsword, as if I were smiting things that may not feel the woes of man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, even so shall it be with me.  But what thinkest\r\nthou of these runaways?  Shall we have tidings of them, or shall Dallach\r\nbring the foe upon us?  It was for the sake of that question that I have\r\nclomb the burg: and that we might watch the land about us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98I have seen many men, and I deem of Dallach that\r\nhe is a true man.  I deem we shall soon have tidings of his fellows; and\r\nthey may have seen the elves and wood-wights: I would fain ask them\r\nthereof, and am eager to see them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98And I somewhat dread to see them, and their rags and\r\ntheir misery and the weals of their stripes.  It irked me to see Dallach\r\nwhen he first fell to his meat last night, how he ate like a dog for fear\r\nand famine.  How shall it be, moreover, when we have them in the Dale,\r\nand they fall to the deed of kind there, as they needs must.  Will they\r\nnot bear us evil and thrall-like men?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Maybe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98and maybe not; for they have been thralls but\r\nfor a little while: and I deem that in no long time shall ye see them\r\nmuch bettered by plenteous meat and rest.  And after all is said, this\r\nDallach bore him like a valiant man; also it was valiant of him to flee;\r\nand of the others may ye say the like.  But look you! there are men going\r\ndown yonder towards our lair: belike those shall be our guests, and there\r\nbe no Dusky Men amongst them.  Come, let us home!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Face-of-god looked and beheld from the height of the burg shapes of\r\nmen grey and colourless creeping toward the lair from sunshine to shadow,\r\nlike wild creatures shy and fearful of the hunter, or so he deemed of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo he turned away, angry and sad of heart, and the twain went down the\r\nburg and across the water to their camp, having seen little to tell of\r\nfrom the height.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to their campment there were their folk standing in a ring\r\nround about Dallach and the other runaways.  They made way for the\r\nWar-leader and Stone-face, who came amongst them and beheld the Runaways,\r\nthat they were many more than they looked to see; for they were of carles\r\none score and three, and of women eighteen, all told save Dallach.  When\r\nthey saw those twain come through the ring of men and perceived that they\r\nwere chieftains, some of them fell down on their knees before them and\r\nheld out their joined hands to them, and kissed the Burgdalers\xe2\x80\x99 feet and\r\nthe hems of their garments, while the tears streamed out of their eyes:\r\nsome stood moving little and staring before them stupidly: and some kept\r\nglancing from face to face of the well-liking happy Burgdale carles,\r\nthough for a while even their faces were sad and downcast at the sight of\r\nthe poor men: some also kept murmuring one or two words in their country\r\ntongue, and Dallach told Face-of-god that these were crying out for\r\nvictual.\r\n\r\nIt must be said of these poor folk that they were of divers conditions,\r\nand chiefly of three: and first there were seven of Rose-dale and five of\r\nSilver-dale late come to the wood (of these Silver-dalers Dallach had\r\ntold but of two, for the other three were but just come).  Of these\r\ntwelve were seven women, and all, save two of the women, were clad in one\r\nscanty kirtle or shirt only; for such was the wont of the Dusky Men with\r\ntheir thralls.  They had brought away weapons, and had amongst them six\r\naxes and a spear, and a sword, and five knives, and one man had a shield.\r\n\r\nYet though these were clad and armed, yet in some wise were they the\r\nworst of all; they were so timorous and cringing, and most of them\r\nheavy-eyed and sullen and down-looking.  Many of them had been grievously\r\nmishandled: one man had had his left hand smitten off; another was docked\r\nof three of his toes, and the gristle of his nose slit up; one was halt,\r\nand four had been ear-cropped, nor did any lack weals of whipping.  Of\r\nthe Silver-dale new-comers the three men were the worst of all the\r\nRunaways, with wild wandering eyes, but sullen also, and cringing if any\r\ndrew nigh, and would not look anyone in the face, save presently\r\nFace-of-god, on whom they were soon fond to fawn, as a dog on his master.\r\nBut the women who were with them, and who were well-nigh as timorous as\r\nthe men, were those two gaily-dad ones, and they were soft-handed and\r\nwhite-skinned, save for the last days of weather in the wood; for they\r\nhad been bed-thralls of the Dusky Men.\r\n\r\nSuch were the new-comers to the wood.  But others had been, like Dallach,\r\nmonths therein; it may be said that there were eighteen of these, carles\r\nand queens together.  Little raiment they had amongst them, and some were\r\nall but stark naked, so that on these might well be seen as on Dallach\r\nthe marks of old stripes, and of these also were there men who had been\r\nshorn of some member or other, and they were all burnt and blackened by\r\nthe weather of the woodland; yet for all their nakedness, they bore\r\nthemselves bolder and more manlike than the later comers, nor did they\r\naltogether lack weapons taken from their foemen, and most of them had\r\nsome edge-tool or another.  Of these folk were four from Silver-dale,\r\nthough Dallach knew it not.\r\n\r\nBesides these were a half score and one who had been years in the wood\r\ninstead of months; weather-beaten indeed were these, shaggy and\r\nrough-skinned like wild men of kind.  Some of them had made themselves\r\nskin breeches or clouts, some went stark naked; of weapons of the Dale\r\nhad they few, but they bore bows of hazel or wych-elm strung with\r\ndeer-gut, and shafts headed with flint stones; staves also of the same\r\nfashion, and great clubs of oak or holly: some of them also had made them\r\ntargets of skin and willow-twigs, for these were the warriors of the\r\nRunaways: they had a few steel knives amongst them, but had mostly\r\nlearned the craft of using sharp flints for knives: but four of these\r\nwere women.\r\n\r\nThree of these men were of the kindreds of the Wolf from Silver-dale, and\r\nhad been in the wood for hard upon ten years, and wild as they were, and\r\nwithout hope of meeting their fellows again, they went proudly and boldly\r\namongst the others, overtopping them by the head and more.  For the\r\ngreater part of these men were somewhat short of stature, though by\r\nnature strong and stout of body.\r\n\r\nIt must be told that though Dallach had thus gotten all these many\r\nRunaways together, yet had they not been dwelling together as one folk;\r\nfor they durst not, lest the Dusky Men should hear thereof and fall upon\r\nthem, but they had kept themselves as best they could in caves and in\r\nbrakes three together or two, or even faring alone as Dallach did: only\r\nas he was a strong and stout-hearted man, he went to and fro and wandered\r\nabout more than the others, so that he foregathered with most of them and\r\nknew them.  He said also that he doubted not but that there were more\r\nRunaways in the wood, but these were all he could come at.  Divers who\r\nhad fled had died from time to time, and some had been caught and cruelly\r\nslain by their masters.  They were none of them old; the oldest, said\r\nDallach, scant of forty winters, though many from their aspect might have\r\nbeen old enough.\r\n\r\nSo Face-of-god looked and beheld all these poor people; and said to\r\nhimself, that he might well have dreaded that sight.  For here was he\r\nbrought face to face with the Sorrow of the Earth, whereof he had known\r\nnought heretofore, save it might be as a tale in a minstrel\xe2\x80\x99s song.  And\r\nwhen he thought of the minutes that had made the hours, and the hours\r\nthat had made the days that these men had passed through, his heart\r\nfailed him, and he was dumb and might not speak, though he perceived that\r\nthe men of Burgdale looked for speech from him; but he waved his hand to\r\nhis folk, and they understood him, for they had heard Dallach say that\r\nsome of them were crying for victual.  So they set to work and dighted\r\nfor them such meat as they had, and they set them down on the grass and\r\nmade themselves their carvers and serving-men, and bade them eat what\r\nthey would of such as there was.  Yet, indeed, it grieved the Burgdalers\r\nagain to note how these folk were driven to eat; for they themselves,\r\nthough they were merry folk, were exceeding courteous at table, and of\r\ngreat observance of manners: whereas these poor Runaways ate, some of\r\nthem like hungry dogs, and some hiding their meat as if they feared it\r\nshould be taken from them, and some cowering over it like falcons, and\r\nscarce any with a manlike pleasure in their meal.  And, their eating\r\nover, the more part of them sat dull and mopish, and as if all things\r\nwere forgotten for the time present.\r\n\r\nAlbeit presently Dallach bestirred him and said to Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Lord of\r\nthe Earl-folk, if I might give thee rede, it were best to turn your faces\r\nto Burgdale without more tarrying.  For we are over-nigh to Rose-dale,\r\nbeing but thus many in company.  But when we come to our next\r\nresting-place, then shall bring thee to speech with the last-comers from\r\nSilver-dale; for there they talk with the tongue of the kindreds; but we\r\nof Rose-dale for the more part talk otherwise; though in my house it came\r\ndown from father to son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, gazing still on that unhappy folk, as they sat\r\nor lay upon the grass at rest for a little while: but him-seemed as he\r\ngazed that some memories of past time stirred in some of them; for some,\r\nthey hung their heads and the tears stole out of their eyes and rolled\r\ndown their cheeks.  But those older Runaways of Silver-dale were not\r\ncrouched down like most of the others, but strode up and down like beasts\r\nin a den; yet were the tears on the face of one of these.  Then\r\nFace-of-god constrained himself, and spake to the folk, and said: \xe2\x80\x98We are\r\nnow over-nigh to our foes of Rose-dale to lie here any longer, being too\r\nfew to fall upon them.  We will come hither again with a host when we\r\nhave duly questioned these men who have sought refuge with us: and let us\r\ncall yonder height the Burg of the Runaways, and it shall be a landmark\r\nfor us when we are on the road to Rose-dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the Burgdalers bade the Runaways courteously and kindly to arise and\r\ntake the road with them; and by that time were their men all come in; and\r\nfour of them had venison with them, which was needful, if they were to\r\neat that night or the morrow, as the guests had eaten them to the bone.\r\n\r\nSo they tarried no more, but set out on the homeward way; and Face-of-god\r\nbade Dallach walk beside him, and asked him such concerning Rose-dale and\r\nits Dusky Men.  Dallach told him that these were not so many as they were\r\nmasterful, not being above eight hundreds of men, all fighting-men.  As\r\nto women, they had none of their own race, but lay with the Daleswomen at\r\ntheir will, and begat children of them; and all or most of the said\r\nchildren favoured the race of their begetters.  Of the men-children they\r\nreared most, but the women-children they slew at once; for they valued\r\nnot women of their own blood: but besides the women of the Dale, they\r\nwould go at whiles in bands to the edges of the Plain and beguile\r\nwayfarers, and bring back with them thence women to be their bed-thralls;\r\nalbeit some of these were bought with a price from the Westland men.\r\n\r\nAs to the number of the folk of Rose-dale, its own folk, he said they\r\nwould number some five thousand souls, one with another; of whom some\r\nthousand might be fit to bear arms if they had the heart thereto, as they\r\nhad none.  Yet being closely questioned, he deemed that they might fall\r\non their masters from behind, if battle were joined.\r\n\r\nHe said that the folk of Rose-dale had been a goodly folk before they\r\nwere enthralled, and peaceable with one another, but that now it was a\r\nsport of the Dusky Men to set a match between their thralls to fight it\r\nout with sword and buckler or otherwise; and the vanquished man, if he\r\nwere not sore hurt, they would scourge, or shear some member from him, or\r\neven slay him outright, if the match between the owners were so made.\r\nAnd many other sad and grievous tales he told to Face-of-god, more than\r\nneed be told again; so that the War-leader went along sorry and angry,\r\nwith his teeth set, and his hand on the sword-hilt.\r\n\r\nThus they went till night fell on them, and they could scarce see the\r\nsigns they had made on their outward journey.  Then they made stay in a\r\nlittle valley, having set a watch duly; and since they were by this time\r\nfar from Rose-dale, and were a great company as regarded scattered bands\r\nof the foe, they lighted their fires and cooked their venison, and made\r\ngood cheer to the Runaways, and so went to sleep in the wild-wood.\r\n\r\nWhen morning was come they gat them at once to the road; and if the\r\nBurgdalers were eager to be out of the wood, their eagerness was as\r\nnought to the eagerness of the Runaways, most of whom could not be easy\r\nnow, and deemed every minute lost unless they were wending on to the\r\nDale; so that this day they were willing to get over the more ground,\r\nwhereas they had not set out on their road till afternoon yesterday.\r\n\r\nHowsoever, they rested at noontide, and Face-of-god bade Dallach bring\r\nhim to speech with others of the Runaways, and first that he might talk\r\nwith those three men of the kindreds who had fled from Silver-dale in\r\nearly days.  So Dallach brought them to him; but he found that though\r\nthey spake the tongue, they were so few-spoken from wildness and\r\nloneliness, at least at first, that nought could come from them that was\r\nnot dragged from them.\r\n\r\nThese men said that they had been in the wood more than nine years, so\r\nthat they knew but little of the conditions of the Dale in that present\r\nday.  However, as to what Dallach had said concerning the Dusky Men, they\r\nstrengthened his words; and they said that the Dusky Men took no delight\r\nsave in beholding torments and misery, and that they doubted if they were\r\nmen or trolls.  They said that since they had dwelt in the wood they had\r\nslain not a few of the foemen, waylaying them as occasion served, but\r\nthat in this warfare they had lost two of their fellows.  When\r\nFace-of-god asked them of their deeming of the numbers of the Dusky Men,\r\nthey said that before those bands had broken into Rose-dale, they counted\r\nthem, as far as they could call to mind, at about three thousand men, all\r\nwarriors; and that somewhat less than one thousand had gone up into\r\nRose-dale, and some had died, and many had been cast away in the\r\nwild-wood, their fellows knew not how.  Yet had not their numbers in\r\nSilver-dale diminished; because two years after they (the speakers) had\r\nfled, came three more Dusky Companies or Tribes into Silver-dale, and\r\neach of these tribes was of three long hundreds; and with their coming\r\nhad the cruelty and misery much increased in the Dale, so that the\r\nthralls began to die fast; and that drave the Dusky Men beyond the\r\nborders of Silver-dale, so that they fell upon Rose-dale.  When asked how\r\nmany of the kindreds might yet be abiding in Silver-dale, their faces\r\nclouded, and they seemed exceeding wroth, and answered, that they would\r\nwillingly hope that most of those that had not been slain at the time of\r\nthe overthrow were now dead, yet indeed they feared there were yet some\r\nalive, and mayhappen not a few women.\r\n\r\nBy then must they get on foot again, and so the talk fell between them;\r\nbut when they made stay for the night, after they had done their meat,\r\nFace-of-god prayed Dallach bring to him some of the latest-come folk from\r\nSilver-dale, and he brought to him the man and the woman who had been in\r\nthe Dale within that moon.  As to the man, if those of the Earl-folk had\r\nbeen few-spoken from fierceness and wildness, he was no less so from mere\r\ndulness and weariness of misery; but the woman\xe2\x80\x99s tongue went glibly\r\nenough, and it seemed to pleasure her to talk about her past miseries.\r\nAs aforesaid, she was better clad than most of those of Rose-dale, and\r\nindeed might be called gaily clad, and where her raiment was befouled or\r\nrent, it was from the roughness of the wood and its weather, and not from\r\nthe thralldom.  She was a young and fair woman, black-haired and\r\ngrey-eyed.  She had washed herself that day in a woodland stream which\r\nthey had crossed on the road, and had arrayed her garments as trimly as\r\nshe might, and had plucked some fumitory, wherewith she had made a\r\ngarland for her head.  She sat down on the grass in front of Face-of-god,\r\nwhile the man her mate stood leaning against a tree and looked on her\r\ngreedily.  The Burgdale carles drew near to her to hearken her story, and\r\nlooked kindly on the twain.  She smiled on them, but especially on\r\nFace-of-god, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou hast sent for me, lord, and I wot well thou wouldst hear my tale\r\nshortly, for it would be long to tell if I were to tell it fully, and\r\nbring into it all that I have endured, which has been bitter enough, for\r\nall that ye see me smooth of skin and well-liking of body.  I have been\r\nthe bed-thrall of one of the chieftains of the Dusky Men, at whose house\r\nmany of their great men would assemble, so that ye may ask me whatso ye\r\nwill; as I have heard much talk and may call it to mind.  Now if ye ask\r\nme whether I have fled because of the shame that I, a free woman come of\r\nfree folk, should be a mere thrall in the bed of the foes of my kin, and\r\nwith no price paid for me, I must needs say it is not so; since over long\r\nhave we of the Dale been thralls to be ashamed of such a matter.  And\r\nagain, if ye deem that I have fled because I have been burdened with\r\ngrievous toil and been driven thereto by the whip, ye may look on my\r\nhands and my body and ye will see that I have toiled little therewith:\r\nnor again did I flee because I could not endure a few stripes now and\r\nagain; for such usage do thralls look for, even when they are delicately\r\nkept for the sake of the fairness of their bodies, and this they may well\r\nendure; yea also, and the mere fear of death by torment now and again.\r\nBut before me lay death both assured and horrible; so I took mine own\r\ncounsel, and told none for fear of bewrayal, save him who guarded me; and\r\nthat was this man; who fled not from fear, but from love of me, and to\r\nhim I have given all that I might give.  So we got out of the house and\r\ndown the Dale by night and cloud, and hid for one whole day in the Dale\r\nitself, where I trembled and feared, so that I deemed I should die of\r\nfear; but this man was well pleased with my company, and with the lack of\r\ntoil and beating even for the day.  And in the night again we fled and\r\nreached the wild-wood before dawn, and well-nigh fell into the hands of\r\nthose who were hunting us, and had outgone us the day before, as we lay\r\nhid.  Well, what is to say?  They saw us not, else had we not been here,\r\nbut scattered piece-meal over the land.  This carle knew the passes of\r\nthe wood, because he had followed his master therein, who was a great\r\nhunter in the wastes, contrary to the wont of these men, and he had lain\r\na night on the burg yonder; therefore he brought me thither, because he\r\nknew that thereabout was plenty of prey easy to take, and he had a bow\r\nwith him; and there we fell in with others of our folk who had fled\r\nbefore, and with Dallach; who e\xe2\x80\x99en now told us what was hard to believe,\r\nthat there was a fair young man like one of the Gods leading a band of\r\ngoodly warriors, and seeking for us to bring us into a peaceful and happy\r\nland; and this man would not have gone with him because he feared that he\r\nmight fall into thralldom of other folk, who would take me away from him;\r\nbut for me, I said I would go in any case, for I was weary of the wood\r\nand its roughness and toil, and that if I had a new master he would\r\nscarcely be worse than my old one was at his best, and him I could\r\nendure.  So I went, and glad and glad I am, whatever ye will do with me.\r\nAnd now will I answer whatso ye may ask of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laid her limbs together daintily and looked fondly on Face-of-god,\r\nand the carle scowled at her somewhat at first, but presently, as he\r\nwatched her, his face smoothed itself out of its wrinkles.\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god pondered a little while, and then asked the woman if she\r\nhad heard any words to remember of late days concerning the affairs of\r\nthe Dusky Men and their intent; and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I pray thee, sister, be truthful in thine answer, for somewhat lieth on\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98How could I speak aught but the sooth to thee, O lovely lord?\r\nThe last word spoken hereof I mind me well: for my master had been\r\nmishandling me, and I was sullen to him after the smart, and he mocked\r\nand jeered me, and said: Ye women deem we cannot do without you, but ye\r\nare fools, and know nothing; we are going to conquer a new land where the\r\nwomen are plenty, and far fairer than ye be; and we shall leave you to\r\nfare afield like the other thralls, or work in the digging of silver; and\r\nbelike ye wot what that meaneth.  Also he said that they would leave us\r\nto the new tribe of their folk, far wilder than they, whom they looked\r\nfor in the Dale in about a moon\xe2\x80\x99s wearing; so that they needs must seek\r\nto other lands.  Also this same talk would we hear whenever it pleased\r\nany of them to mock us their bed-thralls.  Now, my sweet lord, this is\r\nnought but the very sooth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain spake Face-of-god after a while:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, sister, hast thou heard of any of the Dusky Men being slain in\r\nthe wood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and turned pale therewith and caught her breath as one\r\nchoking; but said in a little while:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This alone was it hard for me to tell thee amongst all the I griefs I\r\nhave borne, whereof I might have told thee many tales, and will do one\r\nday if thou wilt suffer it; but fear makes this hard for me.  For in very\r\nsooth this was the cause of my fleeing, that my master was brought in\r\nslain by an arrow in the wood; and he was to be borne to bale and burned\r\nin three days\xe2\x80\x99 wearing; and we three bed-thralls of his, and three of the\r\nbest of the men-thralls, were to be burned quick on his bale-fire after\r\nsore torments; therefore I fled, and hid a knife in my bosom, that I\r\nmight not be taken alive; but sweet was life to me, and belike I should\r\nnot have smitten myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she wept sore for pity of herself before them all.  But Face-of-god\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Knowest thou, sister, by whom the man was slain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, still sobbing; \xe2\x80\x98but I heard nought thereof, nor had I\r\nnoted it in my terror.  The death of others, who were slain before him,\r\nand the loss of many, we knew not how, made them more bitterly cruel with\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd again was she weeping; but Face-of-god said kindly to her: \xe2\x80\x98Weep no\r\nmore, sister, for now shall all thy troubles be over; I feel in my heart\r\nthat we shall overcome these felons, and make an end of them, and there\r\nthen is Burgdale for thee in its length and breadth, or thine own Dale to\r\ndwell in freely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98never will I go back thither!\xe2\x80\x99 and she turned round to\r\nhim and kissed his feet, and then arose and turned a little toward her\r\nmate; and the carle caught her by the hand and led her away, and seemed\r\nglad so to do.\r\n\r\nSo once again they fell asleep in the woods, and again the next morning\r\nfared on their way early that they might come into Burgdale before\r\nnightfall.  When they stayed a while at noontide and ate, Face-of-god\r\nagain had talk with the Runaways, and this time with those of Rose-dale,\r\nand he heard much the same story from them that he had heard before, told\r\nin divers ways, till his heart was sick with the hearing of it.\r\n\r\nOn this last day Face-of-god led his men well athwart the wood, so that\r\nhe hit Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way without coming to Carl-stead; and he came down into\r\nthe Dale some four hours after noon on a bright day of latter March.  At\r\nthe ingate to the Dale he found watches set, the men whereof told him\r\nthat the tidings were not right great.  Hall-face\xe2\x80\x99s company had fallen in\r\nwith a band of the Felons three score in number in the oak-wood nigh to\r\nBoars-bait, and had slain some and chased the rest, since they found it\r\nhard to follow them home as they ran for the tangled thicket: of the\r\nBurgdalers had two been slain and five hurt in this battle.\r\n\r\nAs for Red-coat\xe2\x80\x99s company, they had fallen in with no foemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.  THEY BRING THE RUNAWAYS TO BURGSTEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSO now being out of the wood, they went peaceably and safely along the\r\nPortway, the Runaways mingling with the Dalesmen.  Strange showed amidst\r\nthe health and wealth of the Dale the rags and misery and nakedness of\r\nthe thralls, like a dream amidst the trim gaiety of spring; and\r\nwhomsoever they met, or came up with on the road, whatso his business\r\nmight be, could not refrain himself from following them, but mingled with\r\nthe men-at-arms, and asked them of the tidings; and when they heard who\r\nthese poor people were, even delivered thralls of the Foemen, they were\r\nglad at heart and cried out for joy; and many of the women, nay, of the\r\nmen also, when they first came across that misery from out the heart of\r\ntheir own pleasant life, wept for pity and love of the poor folk, now at\r\nlast set free, and blessed the swords that should do the like by the\r\nwhole people.\r\n\r\nThey went slowly as men began to gather about them; yea, some of the good\r\nfolk that lived hard by must needs fare home to their houses to fetch\r\ncakes and wine for the guests; and they made them sit down and rest on\r\nthe green grass by the side of the Portway, and eat and drink to cheer\r\ntheir hearts; others, women and young swains, while they rested went down\r\ninto the meadows and plucked of the spring flowers, and twined them\r\nhastily with deft and well-wont fingers into chaplets and garlands for\r\ntheir heads and bodies.  Thus indeed they covered their nakedness, till\r\nthe lowering faces and weather-beaten skins of those hardly-entreated\r\nthralls looked grimly out from amidst the knots of cowslip and oxlip, and\r\nthe branches of the milk-white blackthorn bloom, and the long trumpets of\r\nthe daffodils, of the hue that wrappeth round the quill which the webster\r\ntakes in hand when she would pleasure her soul with the sight of the\r\nyellow growing upon the dark green web.\r\n\r\nSo they went on again as the evening was waning, and when they were\r\ngotten within a furlong of the Gate, lo! there was come the minstrelsy,\r\nthe pipe and the tabor, the fiddle and the harp, and the folk that had\r\nlearned to sing the sweetest, both men and women, and Redesman at the\r\nhead of them all.\r\n\r\nThen fell the throng into an ordered company; first went the music, and\r\nthen a score of Face-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s warriors with drawn swords and uplifted\r\nspears; and then the flower-bedecked misery of the Runaways, men and\r\nwomen going together, gaunt, befouled, and hollow-eyed, with here and\r\nthere a flushed cheek or gleaming eye, or tear-bedewed face, as the joy\r\nand triumph of the eve pierced through their wonted weariness of grief;\r\nthen the rest of the warriors, and lastly the mingled crowd of Dalesfolk,\r\ntall men and fair women gaily arrayed, clean-faced, clear-skinned, and\r\nsleek-haired, with glancing eyes and ruddy lips.\r\n\r\nAnd now Redesman turned about to the music and drew his bow across his\r\nfiddle, and the other bows ran out in concert, and the harps followed the\r\nstory of them, and he lifted up his voice and sang the words of an old\r\nsong, and all the singers joined him and blended their voices with his.\r\nAnd these are some of the words which they sang:\r\n\r\n   Lo! here is Spring, and all we are living,\r\n      We that were wan with Winter\xe2\x80\x99s fear;\r\n   Reach out your hands to her hands that are giving,\r\n      Lest ye lose her love and the light of the year.\r\n\r\n   Many a morn did we wake to sorrow,\r\n      When low on the land the cloud-wrath lay;\r\n   Many an eve we feared to-morrow,\r\n      The unbegun unfinished day.\r\n\r\n   Ah we\xe2\x80\x94we hoped not, and thou wert tardy;\r\n      Nought wert thou helping; nought we prayed.\r\n   Where was the eager heart, the hardy?\r\n      Where was the sweet-voiced unafraid?\r\n\r\n   But now thou lovest, now thou leadest,\r\n      Where is gone the grief of our minds?\r\n   What was the word of the tale, that thou heedest\r\n      E\xe2\x80\x99en as the breath of the bygone winds?\r\n\r\n   Green and green is thy garment growing\r\n      Over thy blossoming limbs beneath;\r\n   Up o\xe2\x80\x99er our feet rise the blades of thy sowing,\r\n      Pierced are our hearts with thine odorous breath.\r\n\r\n   But where art thou wending, thou new-comer?\r\n      Hurrying on to the Courts of the Sun?\r\n   Where art thou now in the House of the Summer?\r\n      Told are thy days and thy deed is done.\r\n\r\n   Spring has been here for us that are living\r\n      After the days of Winter\xe2\x80\x99s fear;\r\n   Here in our hands is the wealth of her giving,\r\n      The Love of the Earth, and the Light of the Year.\r\n\r\nThus came they to the Gate, and lo! the Bride thereby, leaning against a\r\nbuttress, gazing with no dull eyes at the coming throng.  She was now\r\nclad in her woman\xe2\x80\x99s attire again, to wit a light flame-coloured gown over\r\na green kirtle; but she yet bore a gilded helm on her head and a sword\r\ngirt to her side in token of her oath to the God.  She had been in\r\nHall-face\xe2\x80\x99s company in that last battle, and had done a man\xe2\x80\x99s service\r\nthere, fighting very valiantly, but had not been hurt, and had come back\r\nto Burgstead when the shift of men was.\r\n\r\nNow she drew herself up and stood a little way before the Gate and looked\r\nforth on the throng, and when her eyes beheld the Runaways amidst of the\r\nweaponed carles of Burgdale, her face flushed, and her eyes filled with\r\ntears as she stood, partly wondering, partly deeming what they were.  She\r\nwaited till Stone-face came by her, and then she took the old man by the\r\nsleeve, and drew him apart a little and said to him: \xe2\x80\x98What meaneth this\r\nshow, my friend?  Who hath clad these folk thus strangely; and who be\r\nthese three naked tall ones, so fierce-looking, but somewhat noble of\r\naspect?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor indeed those three men of the kindreds, when they had gotten into the\r\nDale, and had rested them, and drunk a cup of wine, and when they had\r\nseen the chaplets and wreaths of the spring-flowers wherewith they were\r\nbedecked, and had smelt the sweet savour of them, fell to walking\r\nproudly, heeding not their nakedness; for no rag had they upon them save\r\nbreech-clouts of deer-skin: they had changed weapons with the Burgdale\r\ncarles; and one had gotten a great axe, which he bore over his shoulder,\r\nand the shaft thereof was all done about with copper; and another had\r\nshouldered a long heavy thrusting-spear, and the third, an exceeding tall\r\nman, bore a long broad-bladed war-sword.  Thus they went, brown of skin\r\nbeneath their flower-garlands, their long hair bleached by the sun\r\nfalling about their shoulders; high they strode amongst the shuffling\r\ncarles and tripping women of the later-come thralls.  But when they heard\r\nthe music, and saw that they were coming to the Gate in triumph, strange\r\nthoughts of old memories swelled up in their hearts, and they refrained\r\nthem not from weeping, for they felt that the joy of life had come back\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nNor must it be deemed that these were the only ones amongst the Runaways\r\nwhose hearts were cheered and softened: already were many of them coming\r\nback to life, as they felt their worn bodies caressed by the clear soft\r\nair of Burgdale, and the sweetness of the flowers that hung about them,\r\nand saw all round about the kind and happy faces of their well-willers.\r\n\r\nSo Stone-face looked on the Bride as she stood with face yet\r\ntear-bedewed, awaiting his answer, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Daughter, thou sayest who clad these folk thus?  It was misery that hath\r\nso dight them; and they are the images of what we shall be if we love\r\nfoul life better than fair death, and so fall into the hands of the\r\nFelons, who were the masters of these men.  As for the tall naked men,\r\nthey are of our own blood, and kinsmen to Face-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s new friends; and\r\nthey are of the best of the vanquished: it was in early days that they\r\nfled from thralldom; as we may have to do.  Now, daughter, I bid thee be\r\nas joyous as thou art valiant, and then shall all be well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she smiled on him, and he departed, and she stood a little\r\nwhile, as the throng moved on and was swallowed by the Gate, and looked\r\nafter them; and for all her pity for the other folk, she thought chiefly\r\nof those fearless tall men who were of the blood of those with whom it\r\nwas lawful to wed.\r\n\r\nThere she stood as the wind dried the tears upon her cheeks, thinking of\r\nthe sorrow which these folk had endured, and their stripes and mocking,\r\ntheir squalor and famine; and she wondered and looked on her own fair and\r\nshapely hands with the precious finger-rings thereon, and on the dainty\r\ncloth and trim broidery of her sleeve; and she touched her smooth cheek\r\nwith the back of her hand, and smiled, and felt the spring sweet in her\r\nmouth, and its savour goodly in her nostrils; and therewith she called to\r\nmind the aspect of her lovely body, as whiles she had seen it imaged, all\r\nits full measure, in the clear pool at midsummer, or piece-meal, in the\r\nshining steel of the Westland mirror.  She thought also with what joy she\r\ndrew the breath of life, yea, even amidst of grief, and of how sweet and\r\npure and well-nurtured she was, and how well beloved of many friends and\r\nthe whole folk, and she set all this beside those woeful bodies and\r\nlowering faces, and felt shame of her sorrow of heart, and the pain it\r\nhad brought to her; and ever amidst shame and pity of all that misery\r\nrose up before her the images of those tall fierce men, and it seemed to\r\nher as if she had seen something like to them in some dream or\r\nimagination of her mind.\r\n\r\nSo came the Burgdalers and their guests into the street of Burgstead\r\namidst music and singing; and the throng was great there.  Then\r\nFace-of-god bade make a ring about the strangers, and they did so, and he\r\nand the Runaways alone were in the midst of it; and he spake in a loud\r\nvoice and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men of the Dale and the Burg, these folk whom here ye see in such a\r\nsorry plight are they whom our deadly foes have rejoiced to torment; let\r\nus therefore rejoice to cherish them.  Now let those men come forth who\r\ndeem that they have enough and more, so that they may each take into\r\ntheir houses some two or three of these friends such as would be fain to\r\nbe together.  And since I am War-leader, and have the right hereto, I\r\nwill first choose them whom I will lead into the House of the Face.  And\r\nlo you! will I have this man (and he laid his hand on Dallach),who is he\r\nwhom I first came across, and who found us all these others, and next I\r\nwill have yonder tall carles, the three of them, because I perceive them\r\nto be men meet to be with a War-leader, and to follow him in battle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he drew the three Men of the Wolf towards him, but Dallach\r\nalready was standing beside him.  And folk rejoiced in Face-of-god.\r\n\r\nBut the Bride came forward next, and spake to him meekly and simply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98War-leader, let me have of the women those who need me most, that I may\r\nbring them to the House of the Steer, and try if there be not some good\r\ndays yet to be found for them, wherein they shall but remember the past\r\ngrief as an ugly dream.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god looked on her, and him-seemed he had never seen her so\r\nfair; and all the shame wherewith he had beheld her of late was gone from\r\nhim, and his heart ran over with friendly love towards her as she looked\r\ninto his face with kindly eyes; and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kinswoman, take thy choice as thy kindness biddeth, and happy shall they\r\nbe whom thou choosest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head soberly, and chose from among the guests four women of\r\nthe saddest and most grievous, and no man of their kindred spake for\r\ngoing along with them; then she went her ways home, leading one of them\r\nby the hand, and strange was it to see those twain going through sun and\r\nshade together, that poor wretch along with the goodliest of women.\r\n\r\nThen came forward one after other of the worthy goodmen of the Dale, and\r\nespecially such as were old, and they led away one one man, and another\r\ntwo, and another three, and often would a man crave to go with a woman or\r\na woman with a man, and it was not gainsaid them.  So were all the guests\r\napportioned, and ill-content were those goodmen that had to depart\r\nwithout a guest; and one man would say to another: \xe2\x80\x98Such-an-one, be not\r\ndowncast; this guest shall be between us, if he will, and shall dwell\r\nwith thee and me month about; but this first month with me, since I was\r\nfirst comer.\xe2\x80\x99  And so forth was it said.\r\n\r\nNow to prevent the time to come, it may be said about the Runaways, that\r\nwhen they had been a little while amongst the Burgdalers, well fed and\r\nwell clad and kindly cherished, it was marvellous how they were bettered\r\nin aspect of body, and it began to be seen of them that they were\r\nwell-favoured people, and divers of the women exceeding goodly,\r\nblack-haired and grey-eyed, and very clear-skinned and white-skinned;\r\nmost of them were young, and the oldest had not seen above forty winters.\r\nThey of Rose-dale, and especially such as had first fled away to the\r\nwood, were very soon seen to be merry and kindly folk; but they who had\r\nbeen longest in captivity, and notably those from Silver-dale who were\r\nnot of the kindreds, were for a long time sullen and heavy, and it\r\navailed little to trust to them for the doing of work; albeit they would\r\nfollow about their friends of Burgdale with the love of a dog; also they\r\nwere, divers of them, somewhat thievish, and if they lacked anything\r\nwould liefer take it by stealth than ask for it; which forsooth the\r\nBurgdale men took not amiss, but deemed of it as a jest rather.\r\n\r\nVery few of the Runaways had any will to fare back to their old homes, or\r\nindeed could be got to go into the wood, or, after a day or two, to say\r\nany word of Rose-dale or Silver-dale.  In this and other matters the\r\nBurgdalers dealt with them as with children who must have their way; for\r\nthey deemed that their guests had much time to make up; also they were\r\nwell content when they saw how goodly they were, for these Dalesmen loved\r\nto see men goodly of body and of a cheerful countenance.\r\n\r\nAs for Dallach and the three Silver-dale men of the kindred, they went\r\ngladly whereas the Burgdale men would have them; and half a score others\r\ntook weapons in their hands when the war was foughten: concerning which\r\nmore hereafter.\r\n\r\nBut on the even whereof the tale now tells, Face-of-god and Stone-face\r\nand their company met after nightfall in the Hall of the Face clad in\r\nglorious raiment, and therewith were Dallach and the men of Silver-dale,\r\nwashen and docked of their long hair, after the fashion of warriors who\r\nbear the helm; and they were clad in gay attire, with battle-swords girt\r\nto their sides and gold rings on their arms.  Somewhat stern and sad-eyed\r\nwere those Silver-dalers yet, though they looked on those about them\r\nkindly and courteously when they met their eyes; and Face-of-god yearned\r\ntowards them when he called to mind the beauty and wisdom and\r\nloving-kindness of the Sun-beam.  They were, as aforesaid, strong men and\r\ntall, and one of them taller than any amidst that house of tall men.\r\nTheir names were Wolf-stone, the tallest, and God-swain, and Spear-fist;\r\nand God-swain the youngest was of thirty winters, and Wolf-stone of\r\nforty.  They came into the Hall in such wise, that when they were washed\r\nand attired, and all men were assembled in the Hall, and the Alderman and\r\nthe chieftains sitting on the da\xc3\xafs, Face-of-god brought them in from the\r\nout-bower, holding Dallach by the right hand and Wolf-stone by the left;\r\nand he looked but a stripling beside that huge man.\r\n\r\nAnd when the men in the Hall beheld such goodly warriors, and remembered\r\ntheir grief late past, they all stood up and shouted for joy of them.\r\nBut Face-of-god passed up the Hall with them, and stood before the da\xc3\xafs\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Alderman of the Dale and Chief of the House of the Face, here I bring\r\nto you the foes of our foemen, whom I have met in the Wild-wood, and\r\nbidden to our House; and meseemeth they will be our friends, and stand\r\nbeside us in the day of battle.  Therefore I say, take these guests and\r\nme together, or put us all to the door together; and if thou wilt take\r\nthem, then show them to such places as thou deemest meet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen stood up the Alderman and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men of Silver-dale and Rose-dale, I bid you welcome!  Be ye our friends,\r\nand abide here with us as long as seemeth good to you, and share in all\r\nthat is ours.  Son Face-of-god, show these warriors to seats on the da\xc3\xafs\r\nbeside thee, and cherish them as well as thou knowest how.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god brought them up on to the da\xc3\xafs and sat down on the right\r\nhand of his father, with Dallach on his right hand, and then Wolf-stone\r\nout from him; then sat Stone-face, that there might be a man of the Dale\r\nto talk with them and serve them; and on his right hand first Spear-fist\r\nand then God-swain.  And when they were all sat down, and the meat was on\r\nthe board, Iron-face turned to his son Face-of-god and took his hand, and\r\nsaid in a loud voice, so that many might hear him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Son Face-of-god, son Gold-mane, thou bearest with thee both ill luck and\r\ngood.  Erewhile, when thou wanderedst out into the Wild-wood, seeking\r\nthou knewest not what from out of the Land of Dreams, thou didst but\r\nbring aback to us grief and shame; but now that thou hast gone forth with\r\nthe neighbours seeking thy foemen, thou hast come aback to us with thine\r\nhands full of honour and joy for us, and we thank thee for thy gifts, and\r\nI call thee a lucky man.  Herewith, kinsman, I drink to thee and the\r\nlasting of thy luck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he stood up and drank the health of the War-leader and the\r\nGuests: and all men were exceeding joyous thereat, when they called to\r\nmind his wrath at the Gate-thing, and they shouted for gladness as they\r\ndrank that health, and the feast became exceeding merry in the House of\r\nthe Face; and as to the war to come, it seemed to them as if it were over\r\nand done in all triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.  HALL-FACE GOETH TOWARD ROSE-DALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the morrow Face-of-god took counsel with Hall-face and Stone-face as\r\nto what were best to be done, and they sat on the da\xc3\xafs in the Hall to\r\ntalk it over.\r\n\r\nShort was the time that had worn since that day in Shadowy Vale, for it\r\nwas but eight days since then; yet so many things had befallen in that\r\ntime, and, to speak shortly, the outlook for the Burgdalers had changed\r\nso much, that the time seemed long to all the three, and especially to\r\nFace-of-god.\r\n\r\nIt was yet twenty days till the Great Folk-mote should beholden, and to\r\nHall-face the time seemed long enough to do somewhat, and he deemed it\r\nwere good to gather force and fall on the Dusky Men in Rose-dale, since\r\nnow they had gotten men who could lead them the nighest way and by the\r\nsafest passes, and who knew all the ways of the foemen.  But to\r\nStone-face this rede seemed not so good; for they would have to go and\r\ncome back, and fight and conquer, in less time than twenty days, or be\r\nbelated of the Folk-mote, and meanwhile much might happen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For,\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face, \xe2\x80\x98we may deem the fighting-men of Rose-dale to be\r\nlittle less than one thousand, and however we fall on them, even if it be\r\nunawares at first, they shall fight stubbornly; so that we may not send\r\nagainst them many less than they be, and that shall strip Burgdale of its\r\nfighting-men, so that whatever befalls, we that be left shall have to\r\nbide at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow was Face-of-god of the same mind as Stone-face; and he said moreover:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When we go to Rose-dale we must abide there a while unless we be\r\noverthrown.  For if ye conquer it and come away at once, presently shall\r\nthe tidings come to the ears of the Dusky Men in Silver-dale, and they\r\nshall join themselves to those of Rose-dale who have fled before you, and\r\nbetween them they shall destroy the unhappy people therein; for ye cannot\r\ntake them all away with you: and that shall they do all the more now,\r\nwhen they look to have new thralls in Burgdale, both men and women.  And\r\nthis we may not suffer, but must abide till we have met all our foemen\r\nand have overcome them, so that the poor folk there shall be safe from\r\nthem till they have learned how to defend their dale.  Now my rede is,\r\nthat we send out the War-arrow at once up and down the Dale, and to the\r\nShepherds and Woodlanders, and appoint a day for the Muster and\r\nWeapon-show of all our Folk, and that day to be the day before the Spring\r\nMarket, that is to say, four days before the Great Folk-mote, and\r\nmeantime that we keep sure watch about the border of the wood, and now\r\nand again scour the wood, so as to clear the Dale of their wandering\r\nbands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hall-face; \xe2\x80\x98and I pray thee, brother, let me have an hundred\r\nof men and thy Dallach, and let us go somewhat deep into the wood towards\r\nRose-dale, and see what we may come across; peradventure it might be\r\nsomething better than hart or wild-swine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98I see no harm therein, if Dallach goeth with thee\r\nfreely; for I will have no force put on him or any other of the Runaways.\r\nYet meseemeth it were not ill for thee to find the road to Rose-dale; for\r\nI have it in my mind to send a company thither to give those Rose-dale\r\nman-quellers somewhat to do at home when we fall upon Silver-dale.\r\nTherefore go find Dallach, and get thy men together at once; for the\r\nsooner thou art gone on thy way the better.  But this I bid thee, go no\r\nfurther than three days out, that ye may be back home betimes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this word Hall-face\xe2\x80\x99s eyes gleamed with joy, and he went out from the\r\nHall straightway and sought Dallach, and found him at the Gate.\r\nIron-face had given him a new sword, a good one, and had bidden him call\r\nit Thicket-clearer, and he would not leave it any moment of the day or\r\nnight, but would lay it under his pillow at night as a child does with a\r\nnew toy; and now he was leaning against a buttress and drawing the said\r\nsword half out of the scabbard and poring over its blade, which was\r\nindeed fair enough, being wrought with dark grey waving lines like the\r\neddies of the Weltering Water.\r\n\r\nSo Hall-face greeted him, and smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guest, if thou wilt, thou may\xe2\x80\x99st take that new blade of my father\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nwhich thou lovest so, a journey which shall rejoice it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dallach, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose that thou wouldest fare on thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootsteps, and deemest that I am the man to lead thee on the road, and\r\neven farther than he went; and though it might be thought by some that I\r\nhave seen enough of Rose-dale and the parts thereabout for one while, yet\r\nwill I go with thee; for now am I a man again, body and soul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd therewith he drew Thicket-clearer right out of his sheath and waved\r\nhim in the air.  And Hall-face was glad of him and said he was well apaid\r\nof his help.  So they went away together to gather men, and on the morrow\r\nHall-face departed and went into the Wild-wood with Dallach and an\r\nhundred and two score men.\r\n\r\nBut as for Face-of-god, he fared up and down the Dale following the\r\nWar-arrow, and went into all houses, and talked with the folk, both young\r\nand old, men and women, and told them closely all that had betid and all\r\nthat was like to betide; and he was well pleased with that which he saw\r\nand heard; for all took his words well, and were nought afeard or\r\ndismayed by the tidings; and he saw that they would not hang aback.\r\nMeantime the days wore, and Hall-face came not back till the seventh day,\r\nand he brought with him twelve more Runaways, of whom five were women.\r\nBut he had lost four men, and had with him Dallach and five others of the\r\nDalesmen borne upon litters sore hurt; and this was his story:\r\n\r\nThey got to the Burg of the Runaways on the forenoon of the third day,\r\nand thereby came on five carles of the Runaways\xe2\x80\x94men who had missed\r\nmeeting Dallach that other day, but knew what had been done; for one of\r\nthem had been sick and could not come with him, and he had told the\r\nothers: so now they were hanging about the Burg of the Runaways hoping\r\nsomewhat that he might come again; and they met the Burgdalers full of\r\njoy, and brought them trouts that they had caught in the river.\r\n\r\nAs for the other runaways, namely, five women and two more carles\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nhad gotten them close to the entrance into Silver-dale, where by night\r\nand cloud they came on a campment of the Dusky Men, who were leading home\r\nthese seven poor wretches, runaways whom they had caught, that they might\r\nslay them most evilly in Rose-stead.  So Hall-face fell on the Dusky Men,\r\nand delivered their captives, but slew not all the foe, and they that\r\nfled brought pursuers on them who came up with them the next day, so near\r\nwas Rose-dale, though they made all diligence homeward.  The Burgdalers\r\nmust needs turn and fight with those pursuers, and at last they drave\r\nthem aback so that they might go on their ways home.  They let not the\r\ngrass grow beneath their feet thereafter, till they were assured by\r\nmeeting a band of the Woodlanders, who had gone forth to help them, and\r\nwith whom they rested a little.  But neither so were they quite done with\r\nthe foemen, who came upon them next day a very many: these however they\r\nand the Woodlanders, who were all fresh and unwounded and very valiant,\r\nspeedily put to the worse; and so they came on to Burgstead, leaving\r\nthose of them who were sorest hurt to be tended by the Woodlanders at\r\nCarlstead, who, as might be looked for, deal with them very lovingly.\r\n\r\nIt was in the first fight that they suffered that loss of slain and\r\nwounded; and therein the newly delivered thralls fought valiantly against\r\ntheir masters: as for Dallach, it was no marvel, said Hall-face, that he\r\nwas hurt; but rather a marvel that he was not slain, so little he recked\r\nof point and edge, if he might but slay the foemen.\r\n\r\nSuch was Hall-face\xe2\x80\x99s-tale; and Face-of-god deemed that he had done\r\nunwisely to let him go that journey; for the slaying of a few Dusky Men\r\nwas but a light gain to set against the loss of so many Burgdalers; yet\r\nwas he glad of the deliverance of those Runaways, and deemed it a gain\r\nindeed.  But henceforth would he hold all still till he should have\r\ntidings of Folk-might; so nought was done thereafter save the warding of\r\nthe Dale, from the country of the Shepherds to the Waste above the\r\nEastern passes.\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god himself went up amongst the Shepherds, and abode with a\r\ngoodman hight Hound-under-Greenbury, who gathered to him the folk from\r\nthe country-side, and they went up on to Greenbury, and sat on the green\r\ngrass while he spoke with them and told them, as he had told the others,\r\nwhat had been done and what should be done.  And they heard him gladly,\r\nand he deemed that there would be no blenching in them, for they were all\r\nin one tale to live and die with their friends of Burgdale, and they said\r\nthat they would have no other word save that to bear to the Great\r\nFolk-mote.\r\n\r\nSo he went away well-pleased, and he fared on thence to the Woodlanders,\r\nand guested at the house of a valiant man hight Wargrove, who on the\r\nmorrow morn called the folk together to a green lawn of the Wild-wood, so\r\nthat there was scarce a soul of them that was not there.  Then he laid\r\nthe whole matter before them; and if the Dalesmen had been merry and\r\nready, and the Shepherds stout-hearted and friendly, yet were the\r\nWood-landers more eager still, so that every hour seemed long to them\r\ntill they stood in their war-gear; and they told him that now at last was\r\nthe hour drawing nigh which they had dreamed of, but had scarce dared to\r\nhope for, when the lost way should be found, and the crooked made\r\nstraight, and that which had been broken should be mended; that their\r\nmeat and drink, and sleeping and waking, and all that they did were now\r\nbecome to them but the means of living till the day was come whereon the\r\ntwo remnants of the children of the Wolf should meet and become one Folk\r\nto live or die together.\r\n\r\nThen went Face-of-god back to Burgstead again, and as he stood anigh the\r\nThing-stead once more, and looked down on the Dale as he had beheld it\r\nlast autumn, he bethought him that with all that had been done and all\r\nthat had been promised, the earth was clearing of her trouble, and that\r\nnow there was nought betwixt him and the happy days of life which the\r\nDale should give to the dwellers therein, save the gathering hosts of the\r\nbattle-field and the day when the last word should be spoken and the\r\nfirst stroke smitten.  So he went down on to the Portway well content.\r\n\r\nThereafter till the day of the Weapon-show there is nought to tell of,\r\nsave that Dallach and the other wounded men began to grow whole again;\r\nand all men sat at home, or went on the woodland ward, expecting great\r\ntidings after the holding of the Folk-mote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.  OF THE WEAPON-SHOW OF THE MEN OF BURGDALE AND THEIR\r\nNEIGHBOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW on the day appointed for the Weapon-show came the Folk flock-meal to\r\nthe great and wide meadow that was cleft by Wildlake as it ran to join\r\nthe Weltering Water.  Early in the morning, even before sunrise, had the\r\nwains full of women and children begun to come thither.  Also there came\r\nlittle horses and asses from the Shepherd country with one or two or\r\nthree damsels or children sitting on each, and by wain-side or by beast\r\nstrode the men of the house, merry and fair in their war-gear.  The\r\nWoodlanders, moreover, man and woman, elder and swain and young damsel,\r\nstreamed out of the wood from Carlstead, eager to make the day begin\r\nbefore the sunrise, and end before his setting.\r\n\r\nThen all men fell to pitching of tents and tilting over of wains; for the\r\nApril sun was hot in the Dale, and when he arose the meads were gay with\r\nmore than the spring flowers; for the tents and the tilts were stained\r\nand broidered with many colours, and there was none who had not furbished\r\nup his war-gear so that all shone and glittered.  And many wore gay\r\nsurcoats over their armour, and the women were clad in all their bravery,\r\nand the Houses mostly of a suit; for one bore blue and another\r\ncorn-colour, and another green, and another brazil, and so forth, and all\r\ngleaming and glowing with broidery of gold and bright hues.  But the\r\nwomen of the Shepherds were all clad in white, embroidered with green\r\nboughs and red blossoms, and the Woodland women wore dark red kirtles.\r\nMoreover, the women had set garlands of flowers on their heads and the\r\nhelms of the men, and for the most part they were slim of body and tall\r\nand light-limbed, and as dainty to look upon as the willow-boughs that\r\nwaved on the brook-side.\r\n\r\nThither had the goodmen who were guesting the Runaways brought their\r\nguests, even now much bettered by their new soft days; and much the poor\r\nfolk marvelled at all this joyance, and they scarce knew where they were;\r\nbut to some it brought back to their minds days of joyance before the\r\nthralldom and all that they had lost, so that their hearts were heavy a\r\nwhile, till they saw the warriors of the kindreds streaming into the mead\r\nand bethought them why they carried steel.\r\n\r\nNow by then the sun was fully up there was a great throng on the Portway,\r\nand this was the folk of the Burg on their way to the Weapon-mead.  The\r\nmen-at-arms were in the midst of the throng, and at the head of them was\r\nthe War-leader, with the banner of the Face before him, wherein was done\r\nthe image of the God with the ray-ringed head.  But at the rearward of\r\nthe warriors went the Alderman and the Burg-wardens, before whom was\r\nborne the banner of the Burg pictured with the Gate and its Towers; but\r\nin the midst betwixt those two was the banner of the Steer, a white beast\r\non a green field.\r\n\r\nSo when the Dale-wardens who were down in the meadow heard the music and\r\nbeheld who were coming, they bade the companies of the Dale and the\r\nShepherds and the Woodlanders who were down there to pitch their banners\r\nin a half circle about the ingle of the meadow which was made by the\r\nstreams of Wildlake and the Weltering Water, and gather to them to be\r\nordered there under their leaders of scores and half-hundreds and\r\nhundreds; and even so they did.  But the banners of the Dale without the\r\nBurg were the Bridge, and the Bull, and the Vine, and the Sickle.  And\r\nthe Shepherds had three banners, to wit Greenbury, and the Fleece, and\r\nthe Thorn.\r\n\r\nAs for the Woodlanders, they said that they were abiding their great\r\nbanner, but it should come in good time; \xe2\x80\x98and meantime,\xe2\x80\x99 said they, \xe2\x80\x98here\r\nare the war-tokens that we shall fight under; for they are good enough\r\nbanners for us poor men, the remnant of the valiant of time past.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTherewith they showed two great spears, and athwart the one was tied an\r\narrow, its point dipped in blood, its feathers singed with fire; and they\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98This is the banner of the War-shaft.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the other spear there was nought; but the head thereof was great and\r\nlong, and they had so burnished the steel that the sun smote out a ray of\r\nlight from it, so that it might be seen from afar.  And they said: \xe2\x80\x98This\r\nis the Banner of the Spear!  Down yonder where the ravens are gathering\r\nye shall see a banner flying over us.  There shall fall many a mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSmiled the Dale-wardens, and said that these were good banners to fight\r\nunder; and those that stood nearby shouted for the valiancy of the\r\nWoodland Carles.\r\n\r\nNow the Dale-wardens went to the entrance from the Portway to the meadow,\r\nand there met the Men of the Burg, and two of them went one on either\r\nside of the War-leader to show him to his seat, and the others abode till\r\nthe Alderman and Burg-wardens came up, and then joined themselves to\r\nthem, and the horns blew up both in the meadow and on the road, and the\r\nnew-comers went their ways to their appointed places amidst the shouts of\r\nthe Dalesmen; and the women and children and old men from the Burg\r\nfollowed after, till all the mead was covered with bright raiment and\r\nglittering gear, save within the ring of men at the further end.\r\n\r\nSo came the War-leader to his seat of green turf raised in the ingle\r\naforesaid; and he stood beside it till the Alderman and Wardens had taken\r\ntheir places on a seat behind him raised higher than his; below him on\r\nthe step of his seat sat the Scrivener with his pen and ink-horn and\r\nscroll of parchment, and men had brought him a smooth shield whereon to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nOn the left side of Face-of-god stood the men of the Face all glittering\r\nin their arms, and amongst them were Wolf-stone and his two fellows, but\r\nDallach was not yet whole of his hurts.  On his right were the folk of\r\nthe House of the Steer: the leader of that House was an old white-bearded\r\nman, grandfather of the Bride, for her father was dead; and who but the\r\nBride herself stood beside him in her glorious war-gear, looking as if\r\nshe were new come from the City of the Gods, thought most men; but those\r\nwho beheld her closely deemed that she looked heavy-eyed and haggard, as\r\nif she were aweary.  Nevertheless, wheresoever she passed, and whosoever\r\nlooked on her (and all men looked on her), there arose a murmur of praise\r\nand love; and the women, and especially the young ones, said how fair her\r\ndeed was, and how meet she was for it; and some of them were for doing on\r\nwar-gear and faring to battle with the carles; and of these some were\r\nsober and solemn, as was well seen afterwards, and some spake lightly:\r\nsome also fell to boasting of how they could run and climb and swim and\r\nshoot in the bow, and fell to baring of their arms to show how strong\r\nthey were: and indeed they were no weaklings, though their arms were\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nThere then stood the ring of men, each company under its banner; and\r\nbeyond them stood the women and children and men unmeet for battle; and\r\nbeyond them again the tilted wains and the tents.\r\n\r\nNow Face-of-god sat him down on the turf-seat with his bright helm on his\r\nhead and his naked sword across his knees, while the horns blew up\r\nloudly, and when they had done, the elder of the Dale-wardens cried out\r\nfor silence.  Then again arose Face-of-god and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men of the Dale, and ye friends of the Shepherds, and ye, O valiant\r\nWoodlanders; we are not assembled here to take counsel, for in three\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 time shall the Great Folk-mote be holden, whereat shall be counsel\r\nenough.  But since I have been appointed your Chief and War-leader, till\r\nsuch time as the Folk-mote shall either yeasay or naysay my leadership, I\r\nhave sent for you that we may look each other in the face and number our\r\nhost and behold our weapons, and see if we be meet for battle and for the\r\ndealing with a great host of foemen.  For now no longer can it be said\r\nthat we are going to war, but rather that war is on our borders, and we\r\nare blended with it; as many have learned to their cost; for some have\r\nbeen slain and some sorely hurt.  Therefore I bid you now, all ye that\r\nare weaponed, wend past us that the tale of you may be taken.  But first\r\nlet every hundred-leader and half-hundred-leader and score-leader make\r\nsure that he hath his tale aright, and give his word to the captain of\r\nhis banner that he in turn may give it out to the Scrivener with his name\r\nand the House and Company that he leadeth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he spake and sat him adown; and the horns blew again in token that the\r\ncompanies should go past; and the first that came was Hall-ward of the\r\nHouse of the Steer, and the first of those that went after him was the\r\nBride, going as if she were his son.\r\n\r\nSo he cried out his name, and the name of his House, and said, \xe2\x80\x98An\r\nhundred and a half,\xe2\x80\x99 and passed forth, his men following him in most\r\ngoodly array.  Each man was girt with a good sword and bore a long heavy\r\nspear over his shoulder, save a score who bare bows; and no man lacked a\r\nhelm, a shield, and a coat of fence.\r\n\r\nThen came a goodly man of thirty winters, and stayed before the Scrivener\r\nand cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Write down the House of the Bridge of the Upper Dale at one hundred, and\r\nWar-well their leader.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he strode on, and his men followed clad and weaponed like those of\r\nthe Steer, save that some had axes hanging to their girdles instead of\r\nswords; and most bore casting-spears instead of the long spears, and half\r\na score were bowmen.\r\n\r\nThen came Fox of Upton leading the men of the Bull of Middale, an hundred\r\nand a half lacking two; very great and tall were his men, and they also\r\nbore long spears, and one score and two were bowmen.\r\n\r\nThen Fork-beard of Lea, a man well on in years, led on the men of the\r\nVine, an hundred and a half and five men thereto; two score of them bare\r\nbow in hand and were girt with sword; the rest bore their swords naked in\r\ntheir right hands, and their shields (which were but small bucklers)\r\nhanging at their backs, and in the left hand each bore two\r\ncasting-spears.  With these went two doughty women-at-arms among the\r\nbowmen, tall and well-knit, already growing brown with the spring sun,\r\nfor their work lay among the stocks of the vines on the southward-looking\r\nbents.\r\n\r\nNext came a tall young man, yellow-haired, with a thin red beard, and\r\ngave himself out for Red-beard of the Knolls; he bore his father\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nas the custom of their house was, but the old man, who had long been head\r\nman of the House of the Sickle, was late dead in his bed, and the young\r\nman had not seen twenty winters.  He bade the Scrivener write the tale of\r\nthe Men of the Sickle at an hundred and a half, and his folk fared past\r\nthe War-leader joyously, being one half of them bowmen; and fell shooters\r\nthey were; the other half were girt with swords, and bore withal long\r\nashen staves armed with great blades curved inwards, which weapon they\r\ncalled heft-sax.\r\n\r\nAll these bands, as the name and the tale of them was declared were\r\ngreeted with loud shouts from their fellows and the bystanders; but now\r\narose a greater shout still, as Stone-face, clad in goodly glittering\r\narray, came forth and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Stone-face of the House of the Face, and I bring with me two\r\nhundreds of men with their best war-gear and weapons: write it down,\r\nScrivener!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he strode on like a young man after those who had gone past, and\r\nafter him came the tall Hall-face and his men, a gallant sight to see:\r\ntwo score bowmen girt with swords, and the others with naked swords\r\nwaving aloft, and each bearing two casting-spears in his left hand.\r\n\r\nThen came a man of middle age, broad-shouldered, yellow-haired,\r\nblue-eyed, of wide and ruddy countenance, and after him a goodly company;\r\nand again great was the shout that went up to the heavens; for he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Scrivener, write down that Hound-under-Greenbury, from amongst the\r\ndwellers in the hills where the sheep feed, leadeth the men who go under\r\nthe banner of Greenbury, to the tale of an hundred and four score.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he passed on, and his men followed, stout, stark, and\r\nmerry-faced, girt with swords, and bearing over their shoulders\r\nlong-staved axes, and spears not so long as those which the Dalesmen\r\nbore; and they had but a half score of arrow-shot with them.\r\n\r\nNext came a young man, blue-eyed also, with hair the colour of flax on\r\nthe distaff, broad-faced and short-nosed, low of stature, but very\r\nstrong-built, who cried out in a loud, cheerful voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Strongitharm of the Shepherds, and these valiant men are of the\r\nFleece and the Thorn blended together, for so they would have it; and\r\ntheir tale is one hundred and two score and ten.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the men of those kindreds went past merry and shouting, and they\r\nwere clad and weaponed like to them of Greenbury, but had with them a\r\nscore of bowmen.  And all these Shepherd-folk wore over their hauberks\r\nwhite woollen surcoats broidered with green and red.\r\n\r\nNow again uprose the cry, and there stood before the War-leader a very\r\ntall man of fifty winters, dark-faced and grey-eyed, and he spake slowly\r\nand somewhat softly, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98War-leader, this is Red-wolf of the Woodlanders leading the men who go\r\nunder the sign of the War-shaft, to the number of an hundred and two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he passed on, and his men after him, tall, lean, and silent amidst\r\nthe shouting.  All these men bare bows, for they were keen hunters; each\r\nhad at his girdle a little axe and a wood-knife, and some had long swords\r\nwithal.  They wore, everyone of the carles, short green surcoats over\r\ntheir coats of fence; but amongst them were three women who bore like\r\nweapons to the men, but were clad in red kirtles under their hauberks,\r\nwhich were of good ring-mail gleaming over them from throat to knee.\r\n\r\nLast came another tall man, but young, of twenty-five winters, and spake:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Scrivener, I am Bears-bane of the Woodlanders, and these that come after\r\nme wend under the sign of the Spear, and they are of the tale of one\r\nhundred and seven.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he passed by at once, and his men followed him, clad and weaponed no\r\notherwise than they of the War-shaft, and with them were two women.\r\n\r\nNow went all those companies back to their banners, and stood there; and\r\nthere arose among the bystanders much talk concerning the Weapon-show,\r\nand who were the best arrayed of the Houses.  And of the old men, some\r\nspake of past weapon-shows which they had seen in their youth, and they\r\nset them beside this one, and praised and blamed.  So it went on a little\r\nwhile till the horns blew again, and once more there was silence.  Then\r\narose Face-of-god and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men of Burgdale, and ye Shepherd-folk, and ye of the Woodland, now shall\r\nye wot how many weaponed men we may bring together for this war.\r\nScrivener, arise and give forth the tale of the companies, as they have\r\nbeen told unto you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the Scrivener stood up on the turf-bench beside Face-of-god, and\r\nspake in a loud voice, reading from his scroll:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of the Men of Burgdale there have passed by me nine hundreds and six; of\r\nthe Shepherds three hundreds and eight and ten; and of the Woodlanders\r\ntwo hundreds and nine; so that all told our men are fourteen hundreds and\r\nthirty and three.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow in those days men reckoned by long hundreds, so that the whole tale\r\nof the host was one thousand, five hundred, and four score and one,\r\ntelling the tale in short hundreds.\r\n\r\nWhen the tale had been given forth and heard, men shouted again, and they\r\nrejoiced that they were so many.  For it exceeded the reckoning which the\r\nAlderman had given out at the Gate-thing.  But Face-of-god said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neighbours, we have held our Weapon-show; but now hold you ready, each\r\nman, for the Hosting toward very battle; for belike within seven days\r\nshall the leaders of hundreds and twenties summon you to be ready in arms\r\nto take whatso fortune may befall.  Now is sundered the Weapon-show.  Be\r\nye as merry to-day as your hearts bid you to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he came down from his seat with the Alderman and the Wardens,\r\nand they mingled with the good folk of the Dale and the Shepherds and the\r\nWoodlanders, and merry was their converse there.  It yet lacked an hour\r\nof noon; so presently they fell to and feasted in the green meadow,\r\ndrinking from wain to wain and from tent to tent; and thereafter they\r\nplayed and sported in the meads, shooting at the butts and wrestling, and\r\ntrying other masteries.  Then they fell to dancing one and all, and so at\r\nlast to supper on the green grass in great merriment.  Nor might you have\r\nknown from the demeanour of any that any threat of evil overhung the\r\nDale.  Nay, so glad were they, and so friendly, that you might rather\r\nhave deemed that this was the land whereof tales tell, wherein people die\r\nnot, but live for ever, without growing any older than when they first\r\ncome thither, unless they be born into the land itself, and then they\r\ngrow into fair manhood, and so abide.  In sooth, both the land and the\r\nfolk were fair enough to be that land and the folk thereof.\r\n\r\nBut a little after sunset they sundered, and some fared home; but many of\r\nthem abode in the tents and tilted wains, because the morrow was the\r\nfirst day of the Spring Market: and already were some of the Westland\r\nchapmen come; yea, two of them were with the bystanders in the meadow;\r\nand more were looked for ere the night was far spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.  THE MEN OF SHADOWY VALE COME TO THE SPRING MARKET AT\r\nBURGSTEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the morrow betimes in the morning the Westland chapmen, who were now\r\nall come, went out from the House of the Face, where they were ever wont\r\nto be lodged, and set up their booths adown the street betwixt gate and\r\nbridge.  Gay was the show; for the booths were tilted over with painted\r\ncloths, and the merchants themselves were clad in long gowns of fine\r\ncloth; scarlet, and blue, and white, and green, and black, with broidered\r\nwelts of gold and silver; and their knaves were gaily attired in short\r\ncoats of divers hues, with silver rings about their arms, and short\r\nswords girt to their sides.  People began to gather about these chapmen\r\nat once when they fell to opening their bales and their packs, and\r\nunloading their wains.  There had they iron, both in pigs and forged\r\nscrap and nails; steel they had, and silver, both in ingots and vessel;\r\npearls from over sea; cinnabar and other colours for staining, such as\r\nwere not in the mountains: madder from the marshes, and purple of the\r\nsea, and scarlet grain from the holm-oaks by its edge, and woad from the\r\ndeep clayey fields of the plain; silken thread also from the outer ocean,\r\nand rare webs of silk, and jars of olive oil, and fine pottery, and\r\nscented woods, and sugar of the cane.  But gold they had none with them,\r\nfor that they took there; and for weapons, save a few silver-gilt toys,\r\nthey had no market.\r\n\r\nSo presently they fell to chaffer; for the carles brought them little\r\nbags of the river-borne gold, so that the weights and scales were at\r\nwork; others had with them scrolls and tallies to tell the number of the\r\nbeasts which they had to sell, and the chapmen gave them wares therefor\r\nwithout beholding the beasts; for they wotted that the Dalesmen lied not\r\nin chaffer.  While the day was yet young withal came the Dalesmen from\r\nthe mid and nether Dale with their wares and set up their booths; and\r\nthey had with them flasks and kegs of the wine which they had to sell;\r\nand bales of the good winter-woven cloth, some grey, some dyed, and\r\npieces of fine linen; and blades of swords, and knives, and axes of such\r\nfashion as the Westland men used; and golden cups and chains, and fair\r\nrings set with mountain-blue stones, and copper bowls, and vessels gilt\r\nand parcel-gilt, and mountain-blue for staining.  There were men of the\r\nShepherds also with such fleeces as they could spare from the daily\r\nchaffer with the neighbours.  And of the Woodlanders were four carles and\r\na woman with peltries and dressed deer-skins, and a few pieces of\r\nwell-carven wood-work for bedsteads and chairs and such like.\r\n\r\nSoon was the Burg thronged with folk in all its open places, and all were\r\neager and merry, and it could not have been told from their demeanour and\r\ncountenance that the shadow of a grievous trouble hung over them.  True\r\nit was that every man of the Dale and the neighbours was girt with his\r\nsword, or bore spear or axe or other weapon in his hand, and that most\r\nhad their bucklers at their backs and their helms on their heads; but\r\nthis was ever their custom at all meetings of men, not because they\r\ndreaded war or were fain of strife, but in token that they were free men,\r\nfrom whom none should take the weapons without battle.\r\n\r\nSuch were the folk of the land: as for the chapmen, they were well-spoken\r\nand courteous, and blithe with the folk, as they well might be, for they\r\nhad good pennyworths of them; yet they dealt with them without using\r\nmeasureless lying, as behoved folk dealing with simple and proud people;\r\nand many was the tale they told of the tidings of the Cities and the\r\nPlain.\r\n\r\nThere amongst the throng was the Bride in her maiden\xe2\x80\x99s attire, but girt\r\nwith the sword, going from booth to booth with her guests of the\r\nRunaways, and doing those poor people what pleasure she might, and giving\r\nthem gifts from the goods there, such as they set their hearts on.  And\r\nthe more part of the Runaways were about among the people of the Fair;\r\nbut Dallach, being still weak, sat on a bench by the door of the House of\r\nthe Face looking on well-pleased at all the stir of folk.\r\n\r\nHall-face was gone on the woodland ward; while Face-of-god went among the\r\nfolk in his most glorious attire; but he soon betook him to the place of\r\nmeeting without the Gate, where Stone-face and some of the elders were\r\nsitting along with the Alderman, beside whom sat the head man of the\r\nmerchants, clad in a gown of fine scarlet embroidered with the best work\r\nof the Dale, with a golden chaplet on his head, and a good sword,\r\ngolden-hilted, by his side, all which the Alderman had given to it him\r\nthat morning.  These chiefs were talking together concerning the tidings\r\nof the Plain, and many a tale the guest told to the Dalesmen, some true,\r\nsome false.  For there had been battles down there, and the fall of\r\nkings, and destruction of people, as oft befalleth in the guileful\r\nCities.  He told them also, in answer to their story of the Dusky Men, of\r\nhow men even such-like, but riding on horses, or drawn in wains, an host\r\nnot to be numbered, had erewhile overthrown the hosts of the Cities of\r\nthe Plain, and had wrought evils scarce to be told of; and how they had\r\npiled up the skulls of slaughtered folk into great hills beside the\r\ncity-gates, so that the sun might no longer shine into the streets; and\r\nhow because of the death and the rapine, grass had grown in the kings\xe2\x80\x99\r\nchambers, and the wolves had chased deer in the Temples of the Gods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth he, \xe2\x80\x98I know you, bold tillers of the soil, valiant scourers\r\nof the Wild-wood, that the worst that can befall you will be to die under\r\nshield, and that ye shall suffer no torment of the thrall.  May the\r\nundying Gods bless the threshold of this Gate, and oft may I come hither\r\nto taste of your kindness!  May your race, the uncorrupt, increase and\r\nmultiply, till your valiant men and clean maidens make the bitter sweet\r\nand purify the earth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spake smooth-tongued and smiling, handling the while the folds of his\r\nfine scarlet gown, and belike he meant a full half of what he said; for\r\nhe was a man very eloquent of speech, and had spoken with kings, uncowed\r\nand pleased with his speaking; and for that cause and his riches had he\r\nbeen made chief of the chapmen.  As he spake the heart of Face-of-god\r\nswelled within him, and his cheek flushed; but Iron-face sat up straight\r\nand proud, and a light smile played about his face, as he said gravely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friend of the Westland, I thank thee for the blessing and the kind word.\r\nSuch as we are, we are; nor do I deem that the very Gods shall change us.\r\nAnd if they will be our friends, it is well; for we desire nought of them\r\nsave their friendship; and if they will be our foes, that also shall we\r\nbear; nor will we curse them for doing that which their lives bid them to\r\ndo.  What sayest thou, Face-of-god, my son?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98I say that the very Gods, though they\r\nslay me, cannot unmake my life that has been.  If they do deeds, yet\r\nshall we also do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Outlander smiled as they spake, and bowed his head to Iron-face and\r\nFace-of-god, and wondered at their pride of heart, marvelling what they\r\nwould say to the great men of the Cities if they should meet them.\r\n\r\nBut as they sat a-talking, there came two men running to them from the\r\nPortway, their weapons all clattering upon them, and they heard withal\r\nthe sound of a horn winded not far off very loud and clear; and the\r\nChapman\xe2\x80\x99s cheek paled: for in sooth he doubted that war was at hand,\r\nafter all he had heard of the Dalesmen\xe2\x80\x99s dealings with the Dusky Men.\r\nAnd all battle was loathsome to him, nor for all the gain of his chaffer\r\nhad he come into the Dale, had he known that war was looked for.\r\n\r\nBut the chiefs of the Dalesmen stirred not, nor changed countenance; and\r\nsome of the goodmen who were in the street nigh the Gate came forth to\r\nsee what was toward; for they also had heard the voice of the horn.\r\n\r\nThen one of those messengers came up breathless, and stood before the\r\nchiefs, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98New tidings, Alderman; here be weaponed strangers come into the Dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Alderman smiled on him and said: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, son, and are they a great host\r\nof men?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98not above a score as I deem, and there is a woman\r\nwith them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then shall we abide them here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman, \xe2\x80\x98and thou mightest\r\nhave saved thy breath, and suffered them to bring tidings of themselves;\r\nsince they may scarce bring us war.  For no man desireth certain and\r\npresent death; and that is all that such a band may win at our hands in\r\nbattle to-day; and all who come in peace are welcome to us.  What like\r\nare they to behold?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the man: \xe2\x80\x98They are tall men gloriously attired, so that they seem\r\nlike kinsmen of the Gods; and they bear flowering boughs in their hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Alderman laughed, and said: \xe2\x80\x98If they be Gods they are welcome indeed;\r\nand they shall grow the wiser for their coming; for they shall learn how\r\nguest-fain the Burgdale men may be.  But if, as I deem, they be like unto\r\nus, and but the children of the Gods, then are they as welcome, and it\r\nmay be more so, and our greeting to them shall be as their greeting to us\r\nwould be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven as he spake the horn was winded nearer yet, and more loudly, and\r\nfolk came pouring out of the Gate to learn the tidings.  Presently the\r\nstrangers came from off the Portway into the space before the Gate; and\r\ntheir leader was a tall and goodly man of some thirty winters, in\r\nglorious array, helm on head and sword by side, his surcoat green and\r\nflowery like the spring meads.  In his right hand he held a branch of the\r\nblossomed black-thorn (for some was yet in blossom), and his left had\r\nhold of the hand of an exceeding fair woman who went beside him: behind\r\nhim was a score of weaponed men in goodly attire, some bearing bows, some\r\nlong spears, but each bearing a flowering bough in hand.\r\n\r\nThe tall man stopped in the midst of the space, and the Alderman and they\r\nwith him stirred not; though, as for Face-of-god, it was to him as if\r\nsummer had come suddenly into the midst of winter, and for the very\r\nsweetness of delight his face grew pale.\r\n\r\nThen the new-comer drew nigh to the Alderman and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hail to the Gate and the men of the Gate!  Hail to the kindred of the\r\nchildren of the Gods!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the Alderman stood up and spake: \xe2\x80\x98And hail to thee, tall man!  Fair\r\ngreeting to thee and thy company!  Wilt thou name thyself with thine own\r\nname, or shall I call thee nought save Guest?  Welcome art thou, by\r\nwhatsoever name thou wilt be called.  Here may\xe2\x80\x99st thou and thy folk abide\r\nas long as ye will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the new-comer: \xe2\x80\x98Thanks have thou for thy greeting and for thy\r\nbidding!  And that bidding shall we take, whatsoever may come of it; for\r\nwe are minded to abide with thee for a while.  But know thou, O Alderman\r\nof the Dalesmen, that I am not sackless toward thee and thine.  My name\r\nis Folk-might of the Children of the Wolf, and this woman is the\r\nSun-beam, my sister, and these behind me are of my kindred, and are well\r\nbeloved and trusty.  We are no evil men or wrong-doers; yet have we been\r\ndriven into sore straits, wherein men must needs at whiles do deeds that\r\nmake their friends few and their foes many.  So it may be that I am thy\r\nfoeman.  Yet, if thou doubtest of me that I shall be a baneful guest,\r\nthou shalt have our weapons of us, and then mayest thou do thy will upon\r\nus without dread; and here first of all is my sword!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he cast down the flowering branch he was bearing, and pulled\r\nhis sword from out his sheath, and took it by the point, and held out the\r\nhilt to Iron-face.\r\n\r\nBut the Alderman smiled kindly on him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The blade is a good one, and I say it who know the craft of\r\nsword-forging; but I need it not, for thou seest I have a sword by my\r\nside.  Keep your weapons, one and all; for ye have come amongst many and\r\nthose no weaklings: and if so be that thy guilt against us is so great\r\nthat we must needs fall on you, ye will need all your war-gear.  But\r\nhereof is no need to speak till the time of the Folk-mote, which will be\r\nholden in three days\xe2\x80\x99 wearing; so let us forbear this matter till then;\r\nfor I deem we shall have enough to say of other matters.  Now,\r\nFolk-might, sit down beside me, and thou also, Sun-beam, fairest of\r\nwomen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he looked into her face and reddened, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet belike thou hast a word of greeting for my son, Face-of-god, unless\r\nit be so that ye have not seen him before?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god came forward, and took Folk-might by the hand and kissed\r\nhim; and he stood before the Sun-beam and took her hand, and the world\r\nwaxed a wonder to him as he kissed her cheeks; and in no wise did she\r\nchange countenance, save that her eyes softened, and she gazed at him\r\nfull kindly from the happiness of her soul.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god said: \xe2\x80\x98Welcome, Guests, who erewhile guested me so well:\r\nnow beginneth the day of your well-doing to the men of Burgdale;\r\ntherefore will we do to you as well as we may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Folk-might and the Sun-beam sat them down with the chieftains, one\r\non either side of the Alderman, but Face-of-god passed forth to the\r\nothers, and greeted them one by one: of them was Wood-father and his\r\nthree sons, and Bow-may; and they rejoiced exceedingly to see him, and\r\nBow-may said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now it gladdens my heart to look upon thee alive and thriving, and to\r\nremember that day last winter when I met thee on the snow, and turned\r\nthee back from the perilous path to thy pleasure, which the Dusky Men\r\nwere besetting, of whom thou knewest nought.  Yea, it was merry that\r\ntide; but this is better.  Nay, friend,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98it availeth thee\r\nnought to strive to look out of the back of thine head: let it be enough\r\nto thee that she is there.  Thou art now become a great chieftain, and\r\nshe is no less; and this is a meeting of chieftains, and the folk are\r\nlooking on and expecting demeanour of them as of the Gods; and she is not\r\nto be dealt with as if she were the daughter of some little goodman with\r\nwhom one hath made tryst in the meadows.  There! hearken to me for a\r\nwhile; at least till I tell thee that thou seemest to me to hold thine\r\nhead higher than when last I saw thee; though that is no long time\r\neither.  Hast thou been in battle again since that day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I have stricken no stroke since I slew two felons within\r\nthe same hour that we parted.  And thou, sister, what hast thou done?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98The grey goose hath been on the wing thrice since that,\r\nbearing on it the bane of evil things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen said Wood-wise: \xe2\x80\x98Kinswoman, tell him of that battle, since thou art\r\ndeft with thy tongue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Weary on battles! it is nought save this: twelve days agone\r\nneeds must every fighting-man of the Wolf, carle or of queen, wend away\r\nfrom Shadowy Vale, while those unmeet for battle we hid away in the caves\r\nat the nether end of the Dale: but Sun-beam would not endure that night,\r\nand fared with us, though she handled no weapon.  All this we had to do\r\nbecause we had learned that a great company of the Dusky Men were\r\nover-nigh to our Dale, and needs must we fall upon them, lest they should\r\nlearn too much, and spread the story.  Well, so wise was Folk-might that\r\nwe came on them unawares by night and cloud at the edge of the Pine-wood,\r\nand but one of our men was slain, and of them not one escaped; and when\r\nthe fight was over we counted four score and ten of their arm-rings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Did that or aught else come of our meeting with them that\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98nought came of it: those we slew were but a straying\r\nband.  Nay, the four score and ten slain in the Pine-wood knew not of\r\nShadowy Vale belike, and had no intent for it: they were but scouring the\r\nwood seeking their warriors that had gone out from Silver-dale and came\r\nnot aback.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou art wise in war, Bow-may,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, and he smiled withal.\r\n\r\nBow-may reddened and said: \xe2\x80\x98Friend Gold-mane, dost thou perchance deem\r\nthat there is aught ill in my warring?  And the Sun-beam, she naysayeth\r\nthe bearing of weapons; though I deem that she hath little fear of them\r\nwhen they come her way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, I deem no ill of it, but much good.  For I\r\nsuppose that thou hast learned overmuch of the wont of the Dusky Men, and\r\nhast seen their thralls?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe knitted her brows, and all the merriment went out of her face at that\r\nword, and she answered: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, thou hast it; for I have both seen their\r\nthralls and been in the Dale of thralldom; and how then can I do less\r\nthan I do?  But for thee, I perceive that thou hast been nigh unto our\r\nfoes and hast fallen in with their thralls; and that is well; for whatso\r\ntales we had told thee thereof it is like thou wouldst not have trowed\r\nin, as now thou must do, since thou thyself hast seen these poor folk.\r\nBut now I will tell thee, Gold-mane, that my soul is sick of these\r\ncomings and goings for the slaughter of a few wretches; and I long for\r\nthe Great Day of Battle, when it will be seen whether we shall live or\r\ndie; and though I laugh and jest, yet doth the wearing of the days wear\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked kindly on her and said: \xe2\x80\x98I am War-leader of this Folk, and\r\ntrust me that the waiting-tide shall not be long; wherefore now, sister,\r\nbe merry to-day, for that is but meet and right; and cast aside thy care,\r\nfor presently shalt thou behold many new friends.  But now meseemeth\r\noverlong have ye been standing before our Gate, and it is time that ye\r\nshould see the inside of our Burg and the inside of our House.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIndeed by this time so many men had come out of the street that the place\r\nbefore the Gate was all thronged, and from where he stood Face-of-god\r\ncould scarce see his father, or Folk-might and the Sun-beam and the\r\nchieftains.\r\n\r\nSo he took Wood-father by the hand, and close behind him came Wood-wise\r\nand Bow-may, and he cried out for way that he might speak with the\r\nAlderman, and men gave way to them, and he led those new-comers close up\r\nto the gate-seats of the Elders, and as he clove the press smiling and\r\nbright-eyed and happy, all gazed on him; but the Sun-beam, who was\r\nsitting between Iron-face and the Westland Chapman, and who heretofore\r\nhad been agaze with eyes beholding little, past whose ears the words went\r\nunheard, and whose mind wandered into thoughts of things unfashioned yet,\r\nwhen she beheld him close to her again, then, taken unawares, her eyes\r\ncaressed him, and she turned as red as a rose, as she felt all the\r\nsweetness of desire go forth from her to meet him.  So that, he\r\nperceiving it, his voice was the clearer and sweeter for the inward joy\r\nhe felt, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alderman, meseemeth it is now time that we bring our Guests into the\r\nHouse of our Fathers; for since they are in warlike array, and we are no\r\nlonger living in peace, and I am now War-leader of the Dale, I deem it\r\nbut meet that I should have the guesting of them.  Moreover, when we are\r\ncome into our House, I will bid thee look into thy treasury, that thou\r\nmay\xe2\x80\x99st find therein somewhat which it may pleasure us to give to our\r\nGuests.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Iron-face: \xe2\x80\x98Thou sayest well, son, and since the day is now worn\r\npast noon, and these folk are but just come from the Waste, therefore\r\nsuch as we have of meat and drink abideth them.  And surely there is\r\nwithin our house a coffer which belongeth to thee and me; and forsooth I\r\nknow not why we keep the treasures hoarded therein, save that it be for\r\nthis cause: that if we were to give to our friends that which we\r\nourselves use and love, which would be of all things pleasant to us, if\r\nwe gave them such goods, they would be worn and worsened by our use of\r\nthem.  For this reason, therefore, do we keep fair things which we use\r\nnot, so that we may give them to our friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Guests, both of the Waste and the Westland, since here is no\r\nGate-thing or meeting of the Dale-wardens, and we sit here but for our\r\npleasure, let us go take our pleasure within doors for a while, if it\r\nseem good to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he arose, and the folk made way for him and his Guests; and\r\nFolk-might went on the right hand of Iron-face, and beside him went the\r\nChapman, who looked on him with a half-smile, as though he knew somewhat\r\nof him.  But on the other side of Iron-face went the Sun-beam, whose hand\r\nhe held, and after these came Face-of-god, leading in the rest of the\r\nNew-comers, who yet held the flowery branches in their hands.\r\n\r\nNow so much had Face-of-god told the Dalesmen, that they deemed they all\r\nknew these men for their battle-fellows of whom they had heard tell; and\r\nthis the more as the men were so goodly and manly of aspect, especially\r\nFolk-might, so that they seemed as if they were nigh akin to the Gods.\r\nAs for the Sun-beam, they knew not how to praise her beauty enough, but\r\nthey said that they had never known before how fair the Gods might be.\r\nSo they raised a great shout of welcome as the men came through the Gate\r\ninto the Burg, and all men turned their backs on the booths, so eager\r\nwere they to behold closely these new friends.\r\n\r\nBut as the Guests went from the Gate to the House of the Face, going very\r\nslowly because of the press, there in the front of the throng stood the\r\nBride with the women of the Runaways, whom she had caused to be clad very\r\nfairly; and she was fain to do them a pleasure by bringing them to sight\r\nof these new-comers, of whom she had not heard who they were, though she\r\nhad heard the cry that strangers were at hand.  So there she stood\r\nsmiling a little with the pleasure of showing a fair sight to the poor\r\npeople, as folk do with children.  But when she saw those twain going on\r\neach side of the Alderman she knew them at once; and when the Sun-beam,\r\nwho was on his left side, passed so close to her that she could see the\r\nvery smoothness and dainty fashion of her skin, then was she astonied,\r\nand the world seemed strange to her, and till they were gone by, and for\r\na while afterwards, she knew not where she was nor what she did, though\r\nit seemed to her as if she still saw the face of that fair woman as in a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nBut the Sun-beam had noted her at first, even amongst the fair women of\r\nBurgstead, and she so steady and bright beside the wandering timorous\r\neyes and lowering faces of the thralls.  But suddenly, as eye met eye,\r\nshe saw her face change; she saw her cheek whiten, her eyes stare, and\r\nher lips quiver, and she knew at once who it was; for she had not seen\r\nher before as Folk-might had.  Then the Sun-beam cast her eyes adown,\r\nlest her compassion might show in her face, and be a fresh grief to her\r\nthat had lost the wedding and the love; and so she passed on.\r\n\r\nAs for Folk-might, he had seen her at once amongst all that folk as he\r\ncame into the street, and in sooth he was looking for her; and when he\r\nsaw her face change, as the sight of the Sun-beam smote upon her heart,\r\nhis own face burned with shame and anger, and he looked back at her as he\r\nwent toward the House.  But she saw him not, nor noted him; and none\r\ndeemed it strange that he looked long on the Bride, the treasure of\r\nBurgstead.  But for some while Folk-might was few-spoken and sharp-spoken\r\namongst the chieftains; for he was slow to master his longing and his\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\nSo when all the Guests had entered the door of the House of the Face, the\r\nAlderman turned back, and, standing on the threshold of his House, spake\r\nunto the throng:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men of the Dale, and ye Outlanders who may be here, know that this is a\r\nhappy day; for hither have come to us Guests, men of the kindred of the\r\nGods, and they are even those of whom Face-of-god my son hath told you.\r\nAnd they are friends of our friends and foes of our foes.  These men are\r\nnow in my House, as is but right; but when they come forth I look to you\r\nto cherish them in the best way ye know, and make much of them, as of\r\nthose who may help us and who may by us be holpen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he went in again and into the Hall, and bade show the\r\nNew-comers to the da\xc3\xafs; and wine of the best, and meat such as was to\r\nhand, was set before them.  He bade men also get ready high feast as\r\ngreat as might be against the evening; and they did his bidding\r\nstraightway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.  THE ALDERMAN GIVES GIFTS TO THEM OF SHADOWY VALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the Hall of the Face Folk-might sat on the da\xc3\xafs at the right hand of\r\nthe Alderman, and the Sun-beam on his left hand.  But Iron-face also had\r\nbeheld the Bride how her face changed, and he knew the cause, and was\r\ngrieved and angry and ashamed thereof: also he bethought him how this\r\nstranger was sitting in the very place where the Bride used to sit, and\r\nof all the love, as of a very daughter, that he had had for her; howbeit\r\nhe constrained himself to talk courteously and kindly both to Folk-might\r\nand the Sun-beam, as behoved the Chief of the House and the Alderman of\r\nthe Dale.  Moreover, he was not a little moved by the goodliness and\r\nwisdom of the Sun-beam and the manliness of Folk-might, who was the most\r\nchieftain-like of men.\r\n\r\nBut while they sat there Face-of-god went from man to man of the Guests,\r\nand made much of each, but especially of Wood-father and his sons and\r\nBow-may, and they loved him, and praised him, and deemed him the best of\r\nhall-mates.  Nor might the Sun-beam altogether refrain her from looking\r\nlovingly on him, and it could be seen of her that she deemed he was doing\r\nwell, and like a wise leader and chieftain.\r\n\r\nSo wore away awhile, and men were fulfilled of meat and drink; so then\r\nthe Alderman arose and spake, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not so, Guests, that ye would now gladly behold our market, and\r\nthe goodly wares which the chapmen have brought us from the Cities?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen most men cried out: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, yea!\xe2\x80\x99 and Iron-face said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then shall ye go, nor be holden by me from your pleasure.  And ye\r\nkinsmen who are the most guest-fain and the wisest, go ye with our\r\nfriends, and make all things easy and happy for them.  But first of all,\r\nGuests, I were well pleased if ye would take some small matters out of\r\nour abundance; for it were well that ye see them ere ye stand before the\r\nchapmen\xe2\x80\x99s booths, lest ye chaffer with them for what ye have already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey all praised his bounty and thanked him for his goodwill: so he arose\r\nto go to his treasury, and bade certain of his folk go along with him to\r\nbear in the gifts.  But ere he had taken three steps down the hall,\r\nFace-of-god prevented him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kinsman, if thou hast anywhere a hauberk somewhat better than folk are\r\nwont to bear, such as thine own hand fashioneth, and a sword of the like\r\nstuff, I would have thee give them, the sword to my brother-in-arms\r\nWood-wise here, and the war-coat to my sister Bow-may, who shooteth so\r\nwell in the bow that none may shoot closer, and very few as close; and\r\nher shaft it was that delivered me when my skull was amongst the axes of\r\nthe Dusky Men: else had I not been here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereat Bow-may reddened and looked down, like a scholar who hath been\r\nover-praised for his learning and diligence; but the Alderman smiled on\r\nher and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thank thee, son, that thou hast let me know what these our two friends\r\nmay be fain of: and as for this damsel-at-arms, it is a little thing that\r\nthou askest for her, and we might have found her something more worthy of\r\nher goodliness; yet forsooth, since we are all bound for the place where\r\nshafts and staves shall be good cheap, a greater treasure might be of\r\nless avail to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereat men laughed, and the Alderman went down the Hall with those\r\nbearers of gifts, and was away for a space while they drank and made\r\nmerry: but presently back they came from the treasury bearing loads of\r\ngoodly things which were laid on one of the endlong boards.  Then began\r\nthe gift-giving: and first he gave unto Folk-might six golden cups\r\nmarvellously fashioned, the work of four generations of wrights in the\r\nDale, and he himself had wrought the last two thereof.  To Sun-beam he\r\ngave a girdle of gold, fashioned with great mastery, whereon were images\r\nof the Gods and the Fathers, and warriors, and beasts of the field and\r\nfowls of the air; and as he girt it about her loins, he said in a soft\r\nvoice so that few heard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sun-beam, thou fair woman, time has been when thou wert to us as the\r\nedge of the poisonous sword or the midnight torch of the murderer; but\r\nnow I know not how it will be, or if the grief which thou hast given me\r\nwill ever wear out or not.  And now that I have beheld thee, I have\r\nlittle to do to blame my son; for indeed when I look on thee I cannot\r\ndeem that there is any evil in thee.  Yea, however it may be, take thou\r\nthis gift as the reward of thine exceeding beauty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked on him with kind eyes, and said meekly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, if I have hurt thee unwittingly, I grieve to have hurt so good a\r\nman.  Hereafter belike we may talk more of this, but now I will but say,\r\nthat whereas at first I needed but to win thy son\xe2\x80\x99s goodwill, so that our\r\nFolk might come to life and thriving again, now it is come to this, that\r\nhe holdeth my heart in his hand and may do what he will with it;\r\ntherefore I pray thee withhold not thy love either from him or from me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked on her wondering, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou art such an one as might make\r\nthe old man young, and the boy grow into manhood suddenly; and thy voice\r\nis as sweet as the voice of the song-birds singing in the dawn of early\r\nsummer soundeth to him who hath been sick unto death, but who hath\r\nescaped it and is mending.  And yet I fear thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he kissed her hand and turned unto the others, and he gave unto\r\nBow-may a hauberk of ring-mail of his own fashioning, a sure defence and\r\na wonderful work, and the collar thereof was done with gold and gems.\r\n\r\nBut he said to her: \xe2\x80\x98Fair damsel-at-arms, faithful is thy face, and the\r\nfashion of thee is goodly: now art thou become one of the best of our\r\nfriends, and this is little enough to give thee; yet would we fain ward\r\nthy body against the foeman; so grieve us not by gainsaying us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Bow-may was exceeding glad, and scarce knew how to cease handling\r\nthat marvel of ring-mail.\r\n\r\nThen to Wood-wise Iron-face gave a most goodly sword, the blade all\r\nmarked with dark lines like the stream of an eddying river, the hilts of\r\nsteel and gold marvellously wrought; and all the work of a smith who had\r\ndwelt in the house of his father\xe2\x80\x99s father, and was a great warrior.\r\n\r\nUnto Wood-father he gave a very goodly helm parcel-gilded; and to his\r\nsons and the other folk fair gifts of weapons and jewels and girdles and\r\ncups and other good things; so that their hearts were full of joy, and\r\nthey all praised his open hand.\r\n\r\nThen some of the best and merriest of the kinsmen of the Face, and\r\nFace-of-god with them, brought the Guests out into the street and among\r\nthe booths.  There Face-of-god beheld the Bride again; and she was\r\nstanding by the booth of a chapman and dealing with him for a piece of\r\ngoodly silken cloth to be a gown for one of her guests, and she was\r\ntalking and smiling as she chaffered with him, as her wont was; for she\r\nwas ever very friendly of demeanour with all men.  But he noted that she\r\nwas yet exceeding pale, and he was right sorry thereof, for he loved her\r\nfriendly; yet now had he no shame for all that had befallen, when he\r\nbethought him of the Sun-beam and the love she had for him.  And also he\r\nhad a deeming that the Bride would better of her grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.  THE CHIEFTAINS TAKE COUNSEL IN THE HALL OF THE FACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN turned Face-of-god back into the Hall, and saw where Iron-face sat\r\nat the da\xc3\xafs, and with him Folk-might and Stone-face and the Elder of the\r\nDale-wardens, and Sun-beam withal; so he went soberly up to the board,\r\nand sat himself down thereat beside Stone-face, over against Folk-might\r\nand his father, beside whom sat the Sun-beam; and Folk-might looked on\r\nhim gravely, as a man powerful and trustworthy, yet was his look somewhat\r\nsour.\r\n\r\nThen the Alderman said: \xe2\x80\x98My son, I said not to thee come back presently,\r\nbecause I wotted that thou wouldst surely do so, knowing that we have\r\nmuch to speak of.  For, whatever these thy friends may have done, or\r\nwhatsoever thou hast done with them to grieve us, all that must be set\r\naside at this present time, since the matter in hand is to save the Dale\r\nand its folk.  What sayest thou hereon?  Since, young as thou mayst be,\r\nthou art our War-leader, and doubtless shalt so be after the Folk-mote\r\nhath been holden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god answered not hastily: indeed, as he sat thinking for a minute\r\nor two, the fair spring day seemed to darken about them or to glare into\r\nthe light of flames amidst the night-tide; and the joyous clamour without\r\ndoors seemed to grow hoarse and fearful as the sound of wailing and\r\nshrieking.  But he spake firmly and simply in a clear voice, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There can be no two words concerning what we have to aim at; these Dusky\r\nMen we must slay everyone, though we be fewer than they be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFolk-might smiled and nodded his head; but the others sat staring down\r\nthe hall or into the hangings.\r\n\r\nThen spake Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Thou wert a boy methought when I cast my spear at\r\nthee last autumn, Face-of-god, but now hast thou grown into a man.  Now\r\ntell me, what deemest thou we must do to slay them all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Once again it is clear that we must fall upon them at\r\nhome in Rose-dale and Silver-dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Folk-might nodded: but Iron-face said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Needeth this?  May we not ward the Dale and send many bands into the\r\nwood to fall upon them when we meet them?  Yea, and so doing these our\r\nguests have already slain many, as this valiant man hath told me e\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nnow.  Will ye not slay so many at last, that they shall learn to fear us,\r\nand abide at home and leave us at peace?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god said: \xe2\x80\x98Meseemeth, father, that this is not thy rede, and\r\nthat thou sayest this but to try me: and perchance ye have been talking\r\nabout me when I was without in the street e\xe2\x80\x99en now.  Even if it might be\r\nthat we should thus cow these felons into abiding at home and tormenting\r\ntheir own thralls at their ease, yet how then are our friends of the Wolf\r\nholpen to their own again?  And I shall tell thee that I have promised to\r\nthis man and this woman that I will give them no less than a man\xe2\x80\x99s help\r\nin this matter.  Moreover, I have spoken in every house of the Dale, and\r\nto the Shepherds and the Woodlanders, and there is no man amongst them\r\nbut will follow me in the quarrel.  Furthermore, they have heard of the\r\nthralldom that is done on men no great way from their own houses; yea,\r\nthey have seen it; and they remember the old saw, \xe2\x80\x9cGrief in thy\r\nneighbour\xe2\x80\x99s hall is grief in thy garth,\xe2\x80\x9d and sure it is, father, that\r\nwhether thou or I gainsay them, go they will to deliver the thralls of\r\nthe Dusky Men, and will leave us alone in the Dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is no less than sooth,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Dale-warden, \xe2\x80\x98never have men gone\r\nforth more joyously to a merry-making than all men of us shall wend to\r\nthis war.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98of one thing ye may be sure, that these men\r\nwill not abide our pleasure till we cut them all off in scattered bands,\r\nnor will they sit deedless at home.  Nor indeed may they; for we have\r\nheard from their thralls that they look to have fresh tribes of them come\r\nto hand to eat their meat and waste their servants, and these and they\r\nmust find new abodes and new thralls; and they are now warned by the\r\noverthrows and slayings that they have had at our hands that we are\r\nastir, and they will not delay long, but will fall upon us with all their\r\nhost; it might even be to-day or to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98In all this thou sayest sooth, brother of the Dale; and\r\nto cut this matter short, I will tell you all, that yesterday we had with\r\nus a runaway from Silver-dale (it is overlong to tell how we fell in with\r\nher; for it was a woman).  But she told us that this very moon is a new\r\ntribe come into the Dale, six long hundreds in number, and twice as many\r\nmore are looked for in two eights of days, and that ere this moon hath\r\nwaned, that is, in twenty-four days, they will wend their ways straight\r\nfor Burgdale, for they know the ways thereto.  So I say that Face-of-god\r\nis right in all wise.  But tell me, brother, hast thou thought of how we\r\nshall come upon these men?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How many men wilt thou lead into battle?\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\nFolk-might reddened, and said: \xe2\x80\x98A few, a few; maybe two-hundreds all\r\ntold.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98but some special gain wilt thou be to us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I deem at least,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might.\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Good is that.  Now have we held our Weapon-show in the\r\nDale, and we find that we together with you be sixteen long hundreds of\r\nmen; and the tale of the foemen that be now in Silver-dale, new-comers\r\nand all, shall be three thousands or thereabout, and in Rose-dale hard on\r\na thousand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Scarce so many,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might; \xe2\x80\x98some of the felons have died; we told\r\nover our silver arm-rings yesterday, and the tale was three hundred and\r\neighty and six.  Besides, they were never so many as thou deemest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98yet at least they shall outnumber us sorely.\r\nWe may scarce leave the Dale unguarded when our host is gone; therefore I\r\ndeem that we shall have but one thousand of men for our onslaught on\r\nSilver-dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How come ye to that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Stone-face.\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Abide a while, fosterer!  Though the odds between us\r\nbe great, it is not to be hidden that I wot how ye of the Wolf know of\r\nprivy passes into Silver-dale; yea, into the heart thereof; and this is\r\nthe special gain ye have to give us.  Therefore we, the thousand men,\r\nfalling on the foe unawares, shall make a great slaughter of them; and if\r\nthe murder be but grim enough, those thralls of theirs shall fear us and\r\nnot them, as already they hate them and not us, so that we may look to\r\nthem for rooting out these sorry weeds after the overthrow.  And what\r\nwith one thing, what with another, we may cherish a good hope of clearing\r\nSilver-dale at one stroke with the said thousand men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There remaineth Rose-dale, which will be easier to deal with, because\r\nthe Dusky Men therein are fewer and the thralls as many: that also would\r\nI fall on at the same time as we fall on Silver-dale with the men that\r\nare left over from the Silver-dale onslaught.  Wherefore my rede is, that\r\nwe gather all those unmeet for battle in the field into this Burg, with\r\nten tens of men to strengthen them; which shall be enough for them, along\r\nwith the old men, and lads, and sturdy women, to defend themselves till\r\nhelp comes, if aught of evil befall, or to flee into the mountains, or at\r\nthe worst to die valiantly.  Then let the other five hundreds fare up to\r\nRose-dale, and fall on the Dusky Men therein about the same time, but not\r\nbefore our onslaught on Silver-dale: thus shall hand help foot, so that\r\nstumbling be not falling; and we may well hope that our rede shall\r\nthrive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen was he silent, and the Sun-beam looked upon him with gleaming eyes\r\nand parted lips, waiting eagerly to hear what Folk-might would say.  He\r\nheld his peace a while, drumming on the board with his fingers, and none\r\nelse spake a word.  At last he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98War-leader of Burgdale, all that thou hast spoken likes me well, and\r\neven so must it be done, saving that parting of our host and sending one\r\npart to fall upon Rose-dale.  I say, nay; let us put all our might into\r\nthat one stroke on Silver-dale, and then we are undone indeed if we fail;\r\nbut so shall we be if we fail anywise; but if we win Silver-dale, then\r\nshall Rose-dale lie open before us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My brother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98thou art a tried warrior, and I but a\r\nlad: but dost thou not see this, that whatever we do, we shall not at one\r\nonslaught slay all the Dusky Men of Silver-dale, and those that flee\r\nbefore us shall betake them to Rose-dale, and tell all the tale, and what\r\nshall hinder them then from falling on Burgdale (since they are no great\r\nway from it) after they have murdered what they will of the unhappy\r\npeople under their hands?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98I say not but that there is a risk thereof, but in war\r\nwe must needs run such risks, and all should be risked rather than that\r\nour blow on Silver-dale be light.  For we be the fewer; and if the foemen\r\nhave time to call that to mind, then are we all lost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Stone-face: \xe2\x80\x98Meseemeth, War-leader, that there is nought much to\r\ndread in leaving Rose-dale to itself for a while; for not only may we\r\nfollow hard on the fleers if they flee to Rose-dale, and be there no long\r\ntime after them, before they have time to stir their host; but also after\r\nthe overthrow we shall be free to send men back to Burgdale by way of\r\nShadowy Vale.  I deem that herein Folk-might hath the right of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even so say I,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Alderman; \xe2\x80\x98besides, we might theft leave more\r\nfolk behind us for the warding of the Dale.  So, son, the risk whereof\r\nthou speakest groweth the lesser the longer it is looked on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen spake the Dale-warden: \xe2\x80\x98Yet saving your wisdom, Alderman, the risk\r\nis there yet.  For if these felons come into the Dale at all, even if the\r\nfolk left behind hold the Burg and keep themselves unmurdered, yet may\r\nthey not hinder the foe from spoiling our homesteads; so that our folk\r\ncoming back in triumph shall find ruin at home, and spend weary days in\r\nhunting their foemen, who shall, many of them, escape into the\r\nWild-wood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Sun-beam, \xe2\x80\x98sooth is that; and Face-of-god is wise to\r\nthink of it and of other matters.  Yet one thing we must bear in mind,\r\nthat all may not go smoothly in our day\xe2\x80\x99s work in Silver-dale; so we must\r\nhave force there to fall back on, in case we miss our stroke at first.\r\nTherefore, I say, send we no man to Rose-dale, and leave we no able\r\nman-at-arms behind in the Burg, so that we have with us every blade that\r\nmay be gathered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIron-face smiled and said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou art wise, damsel; and I marvel that so\r\nfair-fashioned a thing as thou can think so hardly of the meeting of the\r\nfallow blades.  But hearken! will not the Dusky Men hear that we have\r\nstripped the Dale of fighting-men, and may they not then give our host\r\nthe go-by and send folk to ruin us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was silence while Face-of-god looked down on the board; but\r\npresently he lifted up his face and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Folk-might was right when he said that all must be risked.  Let us leave\r\nRose-dale till we have overcome them of Silver-dale.  Moreover, my\r\nfather, thou must not deem of these felons as if they were of like wits\r\nto us, to forecast the deeds to come, and weigh the chances nicely, and\r\nunravel tangled clews.  Rather they move like to the stares in autumn, or\r\nthe winter wild-geese, and will all be thrust forward by some sting that\r\nentereth into their imaginations.  Therefore, if they have appointed one\r\nmoon to wear before they fall upon us, they will not stir till then, and\r\nwe have time enough to do what must be done.  Wherefore am I now of one\r\nmind with the rest of you.  Now meseemeth it were well that these things\r\nwhich we have spoken here, and shall speak, should not be noised abroad\r\nopenly; nay, at the Folk-mote it would be well that nought be said about\r\nthe day or the way of our onslaught on Silver-dale, lest the foe take\r\nwarning and be on their guard.  Though, sooth to say, did I deem that if\r\nthey had word of our intent they of Rose-dale would join themselves to\r\nthem of Silver-dale, and that we should thus have all our foes in one\r\nnet, then were I fain if the word would reach them.  For my soul loathes\r\nthe hunting that shall befall up and down the wood for the slaying of a\r\nman here, and two or three there, and the wearing of the days in\r\nwandering up and down with weapons in the hand, and the spinning out of\r\nhatred and delaying of peace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Iron-face reached his hand across the board and took his son\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hail to thee, son, for thy word!  Herein thou speakest as if from my\r\nvery soul, and fain am I of such a War-leader.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd desire drew the eyes of the Sun-beam to Face-of-god, and she beheld\r\nhim proudly.  But he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All hath been spoken that the others of us may speak; and now it falleth\r\nto the part of Folk-might to order our goings for the tryst for the\r\nonslaught, and the trysting-place shall be in Shadowy Vale.  How sayest\r\nthou, Chief of the Wolf?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98I have little to say; and it is for the War-leader to\r\nsee to this closely and piecemeal.  I deem, as we all deem, that there\r\nshould be no delay; yet were it best to wend not all together to Shadowy\r\nVale, but in divers bands, as soon as ye may after the Folk-mote, by the\r\nsure and nigh ways that we shall show you.  And when we are gathered\r\nthere, short is the rede, for all is ready there to wend by the passes\r\nwhich we know throughly, and whereby it is but two days\xe2\x80\x99 journey to the\r\nhead of Silver-dale, nigh to the caves of the silver, where the felons\r\ndwell the thickest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe set his teeth, and his colour came and went: for as constantly as the\r\nonslaught had been in his mind, yet whenever he spake of the great day of\r\nbattle, hope and joy and anger wrought a tumult in his soul; and now that\r\nit was so nigh withal, he could not refrain his joy.\r\n\r\nBut he spake again: \xe2\x80\x98Now therefore, War-leader, it is for thee to order\r\nthe goings of thy folk.  But I will tell thee that they shall not need to\r\ntake aught with them save their weapons and victual for the way, that is,\r\nfor thirty hours; because all is ready for them in Shadowy Vale, though\r\nit be but a poor place as to victual.  Canst thou tell us, therefore,\r\nwhat thou wilt do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god had knit his brows and become gloomy of countenance; but now\r\nhis face cleared, and he set his hand to his pouch, and drew forth a\r\nwritten parchment, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the order whereof I have bethought me.  Before the Folk-mote I\r\nand the Wardens shall speak to the leaders of hundreds, who be mostly\r\nhere at the Fair, and give them the day and the hour whereon they shall,\r\neach hundred, take their weapons and wend to Shadowy Vale, and also the\r\nplace where they shall meet the men of yours who shall lead them across\r\nthe Waste.  These hundred-leaders shall then go straightway and give the\r\nword to the captains of scores, and the captains of scores to the\r\ncaptains of tens; and if, as is scarce doubtful, the Folk-mote yea-says\r\nthe onslaught and the fellowship with you of the Wolf, then shall those\r\nleaders of tens bring their men to the trysting-place, and so go their\r\nways to Shadowy Vale.  Now here I have the roll of our Weapon-show, and I\r\nwill look to it that none shall be passed over; and if ye ask me in what\r\norder they had best get on the way, my rede is that a two hundred should\r\ndepart on the very evening of the day of the Folk-mote, and these to be\r\nof our folk of the Upper Dale; and on the morning of the morrow of the\r\nFolk-mote another two hundreds from the Dale; and in the evening of the\r\nsame day the folk of the Shepherds, three hundreds or more, and that will\r\nbe easy to them; again on the next day two more bands of the Lower Dale,\r\none in the morning, one in the evening.  Lastly, in the earliest dawn of\r\nthe third day from the Folk-mote shall the Woodlanders wend their ways.\r\nBut one hundred of men let us leave behind for the warding of the Burg,\r\neven as we agreed before.  As for the place of tryst for the faring over\r\nthe Waste, let it be the end of the knolls just by the jaws of the pass\r\nyonder, where the Weltering Water comes into the Dale from the East.  How\r\nsay ye?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey all said, and Folk-might especially, that it was right well devised,\r\nand that thus it should be done.\r\n\r\nThen turned Face-of-god to the Dale-warden, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It were good, brother, that we saw the other wardens as soon as may be,\r\nto do them to wit of this order, and what they have to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he arose and took the Elder of the Dale-wardens away with him,\r\nand the twain set about their business straight-way.  Neither did the\r\nothers abide long in the Hall, but went out into the Burg to see the\r\nchapmen and their wares.  There the Alderman bought what he needed of\r\niron and steel and other matters; and Folk-might cheapened him a dagger\r\ncuriously wrought, and a web of gold and silk for the Sun-beam, for which\r\nwares he paid in silver arm-rings, new-wrought and of strange fashion.\r\n\r\nBut amidst of the chaffer was now a great ring of men; and in the midst\r\nof the ring stood Redesman, fiddle and bow in hand, and with him were\r\nfour damsels wondrously arrayed; for the first was clad in a smock so\r\ncraftily wrought with threads of green and many colours, that it seemed\r\nlike a piece of the green field beset with primroses and cowslips and\r\nharebells and windflowers, rather than a garment woven and sewn; and in\r\nher hand she bore a naked sword, with golden hilts and gleaming blade.\r\nBut the second bore on her roses done in like manner, both blossoms and\r\ngreen leaves, wherewith her body was covered decently, which else had\r\nbeen naked.  The third was clad as though she were wading the wheat-field\r\nto the waist, and above was wrapped in the leaves and bunches of the\r\nwine-tree.  And the fourth was clad in a scarlet gown flecked with white\r\nwool to set forth the winter\xe2\x80\x99s snow, and broidered over with the burning\r\nbrands of the Holy Hearth; and she bore on her head a garland of\r\nmistletoe.  And these four damsels were clearly seen to image the four\r\nseasons of the year\xe2\x80\x94Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.  But amidst them\r\nstood a fountain or conduit of gilded work cunningly wrought, and full of\r\nthe best wine of the Dale, and gilded cups and beakers hung about it.\r\n\r\nSo now Redesman fell to caressing his fiddle with the bow till it began\r\nto make sweet music, and therewith the hearts of all danced with it; and\r\npresently words come into his mouth, and he fell to singing; and the\r\ndamsels answered him:\r\n\r\n   Earth-wielders, that fashion the Dale-dwellers\xe2\x80\x99 treasure,\r\n      Soft are ye by seeming, yet hardy of heart!\r\n   No warrior amongst us withstandeth your pleasure;\r\n      No man from his meadow may thrust you apart.\r\n\r\n   Fresh and fair are your bodies, but far beyond telling\r\n      Are the years of your lives, and the craft ye have stored.\r\n   Come give us a word, then, concerning our dwelling,\r\n      And the days to befall us, the fruit of the sword.\r\n\r\n                             _Winter saith_:\r\n\r\n   When last in the feast-hall the Yule-fire flickered,\r\n      The foot of no foeman fared over the snow,\r\n   And nought but the wind with the ash-branches bickered:\r\n      Next Yule ye may deem it a long time ago.\r\n\r\n                             _Autumn saith_:\r\n\r\n   Loud laughed ye last year in the wheat-field a-smiting;\r\n      And ye laughed as your backs drave the beam of the press.\r\n   When the edge of the war-sword the acres are lighting\r\n      Look up to the Banner and laugh ye no less.\r\n\r\n                             _Summer saith_:\r\n\r\n   Ye called and I came, and how good was the greeting,\r\n      When ye wrapped me in roses both bosom and side!\r\n   Here yet shall I long, and be fain of our meeting,\r\n      As hidden from battle your coming I bide.\r\n\r\n                             _Spring saith_:\r\n\r\n   I am here for your comfort, and lo! what I carry;\r\n      The blade with the bright edges bared to the sun.\r\n   To the field, to the work then, that e\xe2\x80\x99en I may tarry\r\n      For the end of the tale in my first days begun!\r\n\r\nTherewith the throng opened, and a young man stepped lightly into the\r\nring, clad in very fair armour, with a gilded helm on his head; and he\r\ntook the sword from the hand of the Maiden of Spring, and waved it in the\r\nair till the westering sun flashed back from it.  Then each of the four\r\ndamsels went up to the swain and kissed his mouth; and Redesman drew the\r\nbow across the strings, and the four damsels sang together, standing\r\nround about the young warrior:\r\n\r\n   It was but a while since for earth\xe2\x80\x99s sake we trembled,\r\n      Lest the increase our life-days had won for the Dale,\r\n   All the wealth that the moons and the years had assembled,\r\n      Should be but a mock for the days of your bale.\r\n\r\n   But now we behold the sun smite on the token\r\n      In the hand of the Champion, the heart of a man;\r\n   We look down the long years and see them unbroken;\r\n      Forth fareth the Folk by the ways it began.\r\n\r\n   So bid ye these chapmen in autumn returning,\r\n      To bring iron for ploughshares and steel for the scythe,\r\n   And the over-sea oil that hath felt the sun\xe2\x80\x99s burning,\r\n      And fair webs for your women soft-spoken and blithe;\r\n\r\n   And pledge ye your word in the market to meet them,\r\n      As many a man and as many a maid,\r\n   As eager as ever, as guest-fain to greet them,\r\n      And bide till the booth from the waggon is made.\r\n\r\n   Come, guests of our lovers! for we, the year-wielders,\r\n      Bid each man and all to come hither and take\r\n   A cup from our hands midst the peace of our shielders,\r\n      And drink to the days of the Dale that we make.\r\n\r\nThen went the damsels to that wine-fountain, and drew thence cups of the\r\nbest and brightest wine of the Dale, and went round about the ring, and\r\ngave drink to whomsoever would, both of the chapmen and the others; while\r\nthe weaponed youth stood in the midst bearing aloft his sword and shield\r\nlike an image in a holy place, and Redesman\xe2\x80\x99s bow still went up and down\r\nthe strings, and drew forth a sweet and merry tune.\r\n\r\nGreat game it was now to see the stark Burgdale carles dragging the Men\r\nof the Plain, little loth, up to the front of the ring, that they might\r\nstretch out their hands for a cup, and how many a one, as he took it,\r\ntook as much as he might of the damsel\xe2\x80\x99s hand withal.  As for the\r\ndamsels, they played the Holy Play very daintily, neither reddening nor\r\nlaughing, but faring so solemnly, and withal so sweetly and bright-faced,\r\nthat it might well have been deemed that they were in very sooth Maidens\r\nof the God of Earth sent from the ever-enduring Hall to cheer the hearts\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nSo simply and blithely did the Men of Burgdale disport them after the\r\nmanner of their fathers, trusting in their valour and beholding the good\r\ndays to be.\r\n\r\nSo wore the evening, and when night was come, men feasted throughout the\r\nBurg from house to house, and every hall was full.  But the Guests from\r\nShadowy Vale feasted in the Hall of the Face in all glee and goodwill;\r\nand with them were the chief of the chapmen and two others; but the rest\r\nof them had been laid hold of by goodmen of the Burg, and dragged into\r\ntheir feast-halls, for they were fain of those guests and their tales.\r\nOne of the chapmen in the House of the Face knew Folk-might, and hailed\r\nhim by the name he had borne in the Cities, Regulus to wit; indeed, the\r\nchief chapman knew him, and even somewhat over-well, for he had been held\r\nto ransom by Folk-might in those past days, and even yet feared him,\r\nbecause he, the chapman, had played somewhat of a dastard\xe2\x80\x99s part to him.\r\nBut the other was an open-hearted and merry fellow, and no weakling; and\r\nFolk-might was fain of his talk concerning times bygone, and the fields\r\nthey had foughten in, and other adventures that had befallen them, both\r\ngood and evil.\r\n\r\nAs for Face-of-god, he went about the Hall soberly, and spake no more\r\nthan behoved him, so as not to seem a mar-feast; for the image of the\r\nslaughter to be yet abode with him, and his heart foreboded the\r\nafter-grief of the battle.  He had no speech with the Sun-beam till men\r\nwere sundering after the feast, and then he came close to her amidst of\r\nthe turmoil, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Time presses on me these days; but if thou wouldest speak with me\r\nto-morrow as I would with thee, then mightest thou go on the Bridge of\r\nthe Burg about sunrise, and I will be there, and we two only.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer face, which had been somewhat sad that evening (for she had been\r\nwatching his), brightened at that word, and she took his hand as folk\r\ncame thronging round about them, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, friend, I shall be there, and fain of thee.\xe2\x80\x99  And therewithal they\r\nsundered for that night.\r\n\r\nAnd all men went to sleep throughout the Burg: howbeit they set a watch\r\nat the Burg-Gate; and Hall-face, when he was coming back from the\r\nwoodland ward about sunset, fell in with Redcoat of Waterless and four\r\nscore men on the Portway coming to meet him and take his place.  All\r\nwhich was clean contrary to the wont of the Burgdalers, who at most\r\nwhiles held no watch and ward, not even in Fair-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE SUN-BEAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACE-OF-GOD was at the Bridge on the morrow before sun-rising, and as he\r\nturned about at the Bridge-foot he saw the Sun-beam coming down the\r\nstreet; and his heart rose to his mouth at the sight of her, and he went\r\nto meet her and took her by the hand; and there were no words between\r\nthem till they had kissed and caressed each other, for there was no one\r\nstirring about them.  So they went over the Bridge into the meadows, and\r\neastward of the beaten path thereover.\r\n\r\nThe grass was growing thick and strong, and it was full of flowers, as\r\nthe cowslip and the oxlip, and the chequered daffodil, and the wild\r\ntulip: the black-thorn was well-nigh done blooming, but the hawthorn was\r\nin bud, and in some places growing white.  It was a fair morning, warm\r\nand cloudless, but the night had been misty, and the haze still hung\r\nabout the meadows of the Dale where they were wettest, and the grass and\r\nits flowers were heavy with dew, so that the Sun-beam went barefoot in\r\nthe meadow.  She had a dark cloak cast over her kirtle, and had left her\r\nglittering gown behind her in the House.\r\n\r\nThey went along hand in hand exceeding fain of each other, and the sun\r\nrose as they went, and the long beams of gold shone through the tops of\r\nthe tall trees across the grass they trod, and a light wind rose up in\r\nthe north, as Face-of-god stayed a moment and turned toward the Face of\r\nthe Sun and prayed to Him, while the Sun-beam\xe2\x80\x99s hand left the\r\nWar-leader\xe2\x80\x99s hand and stole up to his golden locks and lay amongst them.\r\n\r\nPresently they went on, and the feet of Face-of-god led him unwitting\r\ntoward the chestnut grove by the old dyke where he had met the Bride such\r\na little while ago, till he bethought whither he was going and stopped\r\nshort and reddened; and the Sun-beam noted it, but spake not; but he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Hereby is a fair place for us to sit and talk till the day\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nbeginneth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo then he turned aside, and soon they came to a hawthorn brake out of\r\nwhich arose a great tall-stemmed oak, showing no green as yet save a\r\nlittle on its lower twigs; and anigh it, yet with room for its boughs to\r\ngrow freely, was a great bird-cherry tree, all covered now with\r\nsweet-smelling white blossoms.  There they sat down on the trunk of a\r\ntree felled last year, and she cast off her cloak, and took his face\r\nbetween her two hands and kissed him long and fondly, and for a while\r\ntheir joy had no word.  But when speech came to them, it was she that\r\nspake first and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, my dear, sorely I wonder at thee and at me, how we are\r\nchanged since that day last autumn when I first saw thee.  Whiles I\r\nthink, didst thou not laugh when thou wert by thyself that day, and mock\r\nat me privily, that I must needs take such wisdom on myself, and lesson\r\nthee standing like a stripling before me.  Dost thou not call it all to\r\nmind and make merry over it, now that thou art become a great chieftain\r\nand a wise warrior, and I am yet what I always was, a young maiden of the\r\nkindred; save that now I abide no longer for my love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer face was exceeding bright and rippled with joyous smiles, and he\r\nlooked at her and deemed that her heart was overflowing with happiness,\r\nand he wondered at her indeed that she was so glad of him, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, indeed, oft do I see that morning in the woodland hall and thee and\r\nme therein, as one looketh on a picture; yea verily, and I laugh, yet is\r\nit for very bliss; neither do I mock at all.  Did I not deem thee a God\r\nthen? and am I not most happy now when I can call it thus to mind?  And\r\nas to thee, thou wert wise then, and yet art thou wise now.  Yea, I\r\nthought thee a God; and if we are changed, is it not rather that thou\r\nhast lifted me up to thee, and not come down to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet therewithal he knit his brows somewhat and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet thou hast not to tell me that all thy love for thy Folk, and thy\r\nyearning hope for its recoverance, was but a painted show.  Else why\r\nshouldst thou love me the better now that I am become a chieftain, and\r\ntherefore am more meet to understand thy hope and thy sorrow?  Did I not\r\nbehold thee as we stood before the Wolf of the Hall of Shadowy Vale, how\r\nthe tears stood in thine eyes as thou beheldest him, and thine hand in\r\nmine quivered and clung to me, and thou wert all changed in a moment of\r\ntime?  Was all this then but a seeming and a beguilement?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O young man,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98hast thou not said it, that we stood there\r\nclose together, and my hand in thine and desire growing up in me?  Dost\r\nthou not know how this also quickeneth the story of our Folk, and our\r\ngoodwill towards the living, and remembrance of the dead?  Shall they\r\nhave lived and desired, and we deny desire and life?  Or tell me: what\r\nwas it made thee so chieftain-like in the Hall yesterday, so that thou\r\nwert the master of all our wills, for as self-willed as some of us were?\r\nWas it not that I, whom thou deemest lovely, was thereby watching thee\r\nand rejoicing in thee?  Did not the sweetness of thy love quicken thee?\r\nYet because of that was thy warrior\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom and thy foresight an empty\r\nshow?  Heedest thou nought the Folk of the Dale?  Wouldest thou sunder\r\nfrom the children of the Fathers, and dwell amongst strangers?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe kissed her and smiled on her and said: \xe2\x80\x98Did I not say of thee that\r\nthou wert wiser than the daughters of men?  See how wise thou hast made\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe spake again: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, nay, there was no feigning in my love for my\r\npeople.  How couldest thou think it, when the Fathers and the kindred\r\nhave made this body that thou lovest, and the voice of their songs is in\r\nthe speech thou deemest sweet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Sweet friend, I deemed not that there was feigning in thee: I\r\nwas but wondering what I am and how I was fashioned, that I should make\r\nthee so glad that thou couldst for a while forget thy hope of the days\r\nbefore we met.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98O how glad, how glad!  Yet was I nought hapless.  In despite\r\nof all trouble I had no down-weighing grief, and I had the hope of my\r\npeople before me.  Good were my days; but I knew not till now how glad a\r\nchild of man may be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTheir words were hushed for a while amidst their caresses.  Then she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, my friend, I mocked not my past self because I deem that I\r\nwas a fool then, but because I see now that all that my wisdom could do,\r\nwould have come about without my wisdom; and that thou, deeming thyself\r\nsomething less than wise, didst accomplish the thing I craved, and that\r\nwhich thou didst crave also; and withal wisdom embraced thee, along with\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she cast her arms about him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O friend, I mock myself of this: that erst thou deemedst me a God and\r\nfearedst me, but now thou seemest to me to be a God, and I fear thee.\r\nYea, though I have longed so sore to be with thee since the day of\r\nShadowy Vale, and though I have wearied of the slow wearing of the days,\r\nand it hath tormented me; yet now that I am with thee, I bless the\r\ntorment of my longing; for it is but my longing that compelleth me to\r\ncast away my fear of thee and caress thee, because I have learned how\r\nsweet it is to love thee thus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe wound his arms about her, and sweeter was their longing than mere joy;\r\nand though their love was beyond measure, yet was therein no shame to\r\naught, not even to the lovely Dale and that fair season of spring, so\r\ngoodly they were among the children of men.\r\n\r\nIn a while they arose and turned homeward, and went over the open meadow,\r\nand it was yet early, and the dew was as heavy on the grass as before,\r\nthough the wide sunlight was now upon it, glittering on the wet blades,\r\nand shining through the bells of the chequered daffodils till they looked\r\nlike gouts of blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sun-beam, as they went along by the same way whereas they\r\ncame, \xe2\x80\x98deemest thou not that other speech-friends besides us have been\r\nabroad to talk together apart on this morning of the eve of battle.  It\r\nis nought unwonted, that we do, even though we forget the trouble of the\r\npeople to think of our own joy for a while.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe smile died out of her face as she spoke, and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O friend, this much may I say for myself in all sooth, that indeed I\r\nwould die for the kindred and its good days, nor falter therein; but if I\r\nam to die, might I but die in thine arms!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked very lovingly on her, and put his arm about her and kissed her\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98What ails us to stand in the doom-ring and bear witness\r\nagainst ourselves before the kindred?  Now I will say, that whatsoever\r\nthe kindred may or can call upon me to do, that will I do, nor grudge the\r\ndeed: I am sackless before them.  But that is true which I spake to thee\r\nwhen we came together up out of Shadowy Vale, to wit, that I am no\r\nstrifeful man, but a peaceful; and I look to it to win through this war,\r\nand find on the other side either death, or life amongst a happy folk;\r\nand I deem that this is mostly the mind of our people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou shalt not die, thou shalt not die!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mayhappen not,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98yet yesterday I could not but look into the\r\nslaughter to come, and it seemed to me a grim thing, and darkened the day\r\nfor me; and I grew acold as a man walking with the dead.  But tell me:\r\nthou sayest I shall not die; dost thou say this only because I am become\r\ndear to thee, or dost thou speak it out of thy foresight of things to\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe stopped and looked silently a while over the meadows towards the\r\nhouses of the Thorp: they were standing now on the border of a shallow\r\nbrook that ran down toward the Weltering Water; it had a little strand of\r\nfine sand like the sea-shore, driven close together, and all moist,\r\nbecause that brook was used to flood the meadow for the feeding of the\r\ngrass; and the last evening the hatches which held up the water had been\r\ndrawn, so that much had ebbed away and left the strand aforesaid.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the Sun-beam turned to Face-of-god, and she was become\r\nsomewhat pale; she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, I have striven to see, and can see nought save the picture of hope\r\nand fear that I make for myself.  So it oft befalleth foreseeing women,\r\nthat the love of a man cloudeth their vision.  Be content, dear friend;\r\nit is for life or death; but whichso it be, the same for me and thee\r\ntogether?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and well content I am; so now let each of us trust in\r\nthe other to be both good and dear, even as I trusted in thee the first\r\nhour that I looked on thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98it is well.  How fair thou art; and how fair is\r\nthe morn, and this our Dale in the goodly season; and all this abideth us\r\nwhen the battle is over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOnce more her voice became sweet and wheedling, and the smile lit up her\r\nface again, and she pointed down to the sand with her finger, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98See thou!  Here indeed have other lovers passed by across the brook.\r\nShall we wish them good luck?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed and looked down on the sand, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou art in haste to make a story up.  Indeed I see that these first\r\nfootprints are of a woman, for no carle of the Dale has a foot as small;\r\nfor we be tall fellows; and these others withal are a man\xe2\x80\x99s footprints;\r\nand if they showed that they had been walking side by side, simple had\r\nbeen thy tale; but so it is not.  I cannot say that these two pairs of\r\nfeet went over the brook within five minutes of each other; but sure it\r\nis that they could not have been faring side by side.  Well, belike they\r\nwere lovers bickering, and we may wish them luck out of that.  Truly it\r\nis well seen that Bow-may hath done thine hunting for thee, dear friend;\r\nor else wouldest thou have lacked venison; for thou hast no hunter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but wish them luck, and give me thine hand upon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and fondled it, and said: \xe2\x80\x98By this hand of my\r\nspeech-friend, I wish these twain all luck, in love and in leisure, in\r\nfaring and fighting, in sowing and samming, in getting and giving.  Is it\r\nwell enough wished?  If so it be, then come thy ways, dear friend; for\r\nthe day\xe2\x80\x99s work is at hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well wished,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98Now hearken: by the valiant hand of the\r\nWar-leader, by the hand that shall unloose my girdle, I wish these twain\r\nto be as happy as we be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe made as if to draw her away, but she hung aback to set the print of\r\nher foot beside the woman\xe2\x80\x99s foot, and then they went on together, and\r\nsoon crossed the Bridge, and came home to the House of the Face.\r\n\r\nWhen they had broken their fast, Face-of-god would straight get to his\r\nbusiness of ordering matters for the warfare, and was wishful to speak\r\nwith Folk-might; but found him not, either in the House or the street.\r\nBut a man said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw the tall Guest come abroad from the House and go toward the Bridge\r\nvery early in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Sun-beam, who was anigh when that was spoken, heard it and smiled,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, deemest thou that it was my brother whom we\r\nblessed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wot not,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98but I would he were here, for this gear must\r\nspeedily be looked to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was nigh an hour before Folk-might came home to the\r\nHouse.  He strode in lightly and gaily, and shaking the crest of his\r\nwar-helm as he went.  He looked friendly on Face-of-god, and said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou hast been seeking me, War-leader; but grudge it not that I have\r\ncaused thee to tarry.  For as things have gone, I am twice the man for\r\nthine helping that I was yester-eve; and thou art so ready and deft, that\r\nall will be done in due time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked as if he would have had Face-of-god ask of him what made him so\r\nfain, but Face-of-god said only:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad of thy gladness; but now let us dally no longer, for I have\r\nmany folk to see to-day and much to set a-going.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo therewith they spake together a while, and then went their ways\r\ntogether toward Carlstead and the Woodlanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.  FOLK-MIGHT SPEAKETH WITH THE BRIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT must be told that those footprints which Face-of-god and the Sun-beam\r\nhad blessed betwixt jest and earnest had more to do with them than they\r\nwotted of.  For Folk-might, who had had many thoughts and longings since\r\nhe had seen the Bride again, rose up early about sunrise, and went\r\nout-a-doors, and wandered about the Burg, letting his eyes stray over the\r\ngoodly stone houses and their trim gardens, yet noting them little, since\r\nthe Bride was not there.\r\n\r\nAt last he came to where there was an open place, straight-sided, longer\r\nthan it was wide, with a wall on each side of it, over which showed the\r\nblossomed boughs of pear and cherry and plum-trees: on either hand before\r\nthe wall was a row of great lindens, now showing their first tender\r\ngreen, especially on their lower twigs, where they were sheltered by the\r\nwall.  At the nether end of this place Folk-might saw a grey stone house,\r\nand he went towards it betwixt the lindens, for it seemed right great,\r\nand presently was but a score of paces from its door, and as yet there\r\nwas no man, carle or queen, stirring about it.\r\n\r\nIt was a long low house with a very steep roof; but belike the hall was\r\nbuilt over some undercroft, for many steps went up to the door on either\r\nhand; and the doorway was low, with a straight lintel under its arch.\r\nThis house, like the House of the Face, seemed ancient and somewhat\r\nstrange, and Folk-might could not choose but take note of it.  The front\r\nwas all of good ashlar work, but it was carven all over, without heed\r\nbeing paid to the joints of the stones, into one picture of a flowery\r\nmeadow, with tall trees and bushes in it, and fowl perched in the trees\r\nand running through the grass, and sheep and kine and oxen and horses\r\nfeeding down the meadow; and over the door at the top of the stair was\r\nwrought a great steer bigger than all the other neat, whose head was\r\nturned toward the sun-rising and uplifted with open mouth, as though he\r\nwere lowing aloud.  Exceeding fair seemed that house to Folk-might, and\r\nas though it were the dwelling of some great kindred.\r\n\r\nBut he had scarce gone over it with his eyes, and was just about to draw\r\nnigher yet to it, when the door at the top of those steps opened, and a\r\nwoman came out of the house clad in a green kirtle and a gown of brazil,\r\nwith a golden-hilted sword girt to her side.  Folk-might saw at once that\r\nit was the Bride, and drew aback behind one of the trees so that she\r\nmight not see him, if she had not already seen him, as it seemed not that\r\nshe had, for she stayed but for a moment on the top of the stair, looking\r\nout down the tree-rows, and then came down the stair and went soberly\r\nalong the road, passing so close to Folk-might that he could see the\r\nfashion of her beauty closely, as one looks into the work of some deftest\r\nartificer.  Then it came suddenly into his head that he would follow her\r\nand see whither she was wending.  \xe2\x80\x98At least,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to himself, \xe2\x80\x98if I\r\ncome not to speech with her, I shall be nigh unto her, and shall see\r\nsomewhat of her beauty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he came out quietly from behind the tree, and followed her softly; and\r\nhe was clad in no garment save his kirtle, and bare no weapons to clash\r\nand jingle, though he had his helm on his head for lack of a softer hat.\r\nHe kept her well in sight, and she went straight onward and looked not\r\nback.  She went by the way whereas he had come, till they were in the\r\nmain street, wherein as yet was no one afoot; she made her way to the\r\nBridge, and passed over it into the meadows; but when she had gone but a\r\nfew steps, she stayed a little and looked on the ground, and as she did\r\nso turned a little toward Folk-might, who had drawn back into the last of\r\nthe refuges over the up-stream buttresses.  He saw that there was a\r\nhalf-smile on her face, but he could not tell whether she were glad or\r\nsorry.  A light wind was beginning to blow, that stirred her raiment and\r\nraised a lock of hair that had strayed from the golden fillet round about\r\nher head, and she looked most marvellous fair.\r\n\r\nNow she looked along the grass that glittered under the beams of the\r\nnewly-risen sun, and noted belike how heavy the dew lay on it; and the\r\ngrass was high already, for the spring had been hot, and haysel would be\r\nearly in the Dale.  So she put off her shoes, that were of deerskin and\r\nbroidered with golden threads, and turned somewhat from the way, and hung\r\nthem up amidst the new green leaves of a hawthorn bush that stood nearby,\r\nand so went thwart the meadow somewhat eastward straight from that bush,\r\nand her feet shone out like pearls amidst the deep green grass.\r\n\r\nFolk-might followed presently, and she stayed not again, nor turned, nor\r\nbeheld him; he recked not if she had, for then would he have come up with\r\nher and hailed her, and he knew that she was no foolish maiden to start\r\nat the sight of a man who was the friend of her Folk.\r\n\r\nSo they went their ways till she came to the strand of the water-meadow\r\nbrook aforesaid, and she went through the little ripples of the shallow\r\nwithout staying, and on through the tall deep grass of the meadow beyond,\r\nto where they met the brook again; for it swept round the meadow in a\r\nwide curve, and turned back toward itself; so it was some half furlong\r\nover from water to water.\r\n\r\nShe stood a while on the brink of the brook here, which was brim-full and\r\nnigh running into the grass, because there was a dam just below the\r\nplace; and Folk-might drew nigher to her under cover of the thorn-bushes,\r\nand looked at the place about her and beyond her.  The meadow beyond\r\nstream was very fair and flowery, but not right great; for it was bounded\r\nby a grove of ancient chestnut trees, that went on and on toward the\r\nsouthern cliffs of the Dale: in front of the chestnut wood stood a broken\r\nrow of black-thorn bushes, now growing green and losing their blossom,\r\nand he could see betwixt them that there was a grassy bank running along,\r\nas if there had once been a turf-wall and ditch round about the chestnut\r\ntrees.  For indeed this was the old place of tryst between Gold-mane and\r\nthe Bride, whereof the tale hath told before.\r\n\r\nThe Bride stayed scarce longer than gave him time to note all this; but\r\nhe deemed that she was weeping, though he could not rightly see her face;\r\nfor her shoulders heaved, and she hung her face adown and put up her\r\nhands to it.  But now she went a little higher up the stream, where the\r\nwater was shallower, and waded the stream and went up over the meadow,\r\nstill weeping, as he deemed, and went between the black-thorn bushes, and\r\nsat her down on the grassy bank with her back to the chestnut trees.\r\n\r\nFolk-might was ashamed to have seen her weeping, and was half-minded to\r\nturn him back again at once; but love constrained him, and he said to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x98Where shall I see her again privily if I pass by this time and\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x99  So he waited a little till he deemed she might have mastered the\r\npassion of tears, and then came forth from his bush, and went down to the\r\nwater and crossed it, and went quietly over the meadow straight towards\r\nher.  But he was not half-way across, when she lifted up her face from\r\nbetween her hands and beheld the man coming.  She neither started nor\r\nrose up; but straightened herself as she sat, and looked right into\r\nFolk-might\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as he drew near, though the tears were not dry on her\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nNow he stood before her, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Hail to the Daughter of a mighty\r\nHouse!  Mayst thou live happy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe answered: \xe2\x80\x98Hail to thee also, Guest of our Folk!  Hast thou been\r\nwandering about our meadows, and happened on me perchance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98I saw thee come forth from the House of the Steer, and I\r\nfollowed thee hither.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe reddened a little, and knit her brow, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou wilt have something to say to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have much to say to thee,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98yet it was sweet to me to behold\r\nthee, even if I might not speak with thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked on him with her deep simple eyes, and neither reddened again,\r\nnor seemed wroth; then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speak what thou hast in thine heart, and I will hearken without anger\r\nwhatsoever it may be; even if thou hast but to tell me of the passing\r\nfolly of a mighty man, which in a month or two he will not remember for\r\nsorrow or for joy.  Sit here beside me, and tell me thy thought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he sat him adown and said: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, I have much to say to thee, but it is\r\nhard to me to say it.  But this I will say: to-day and yesterday make the\r\nthird time I have seen thee.  The first time thou wert happy and calm,\r\nand no shadow of trouble was on thee; the second time thine happy days\r\nwere waning, though thou scarce knewest it; but to-day and yesterday thou\r\nart constrained by the bonds of grief, and wouldest loosen them if thou\r\nmightest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98What meanest thou?  How knowest thou this?  How may a stranger\r\npartake in my joy and my sorrow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98As for yesterday, all the people might see thy grief and know\r\nit.  But when I beheld thee the first time, I saw thee that thou wert\r\nmore fair and lovely than all other women; and when I was away from thee,\r\nthe thought of thee and thine image were with me, and I might not put\r\nthem away; and oft at such and such a time I wondered and said to myself,\r\nwhat is she doing now? though god wot I was dealing with tangles and\r\ntroubles and rough deeds enough.  But the second time I beheld thee, when\r\nI had looked to have great joy in the sight of thee, my heart was smitten\r\nwith a pang of grief; for I saw thee hanging on the words and the looks\r\nof another man, who was light-minded toward thee, and that thou wert\r\ntroubled with the anguish of doubt and fear.  And he knew it not, nor saw\r\nit, though I saw it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer face grew troubled, and the tearful passion stirred within her.  But\r\nshe held it aback, and said, as anyone might have said it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How wert thou in the Dale, mighty man?  We saw thee not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98I came hither hidden in other semblance than mine own.  But\r\nmeddle not therewith; it availeth nought.  Let me say this, and do thou\r\nhearken to it.  I saw thee yesterday in the street, and thou wert as the\r\nghost of thine old gladness; although belike thou hast striven with\r\nsorrow; for I see thee with a sword by thy side, and we have been told\r\nthat thou, O fairest of women, hast given thyself to the Warrior to be\r\nhis damsel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that is sooth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went on: \xe2\x80\x98But the face which thou bearedst yesterday against thy will,\r\namidst all the people, that was because thou hadst seen my sister the\r\nSun-beam for the first time, and Face-of-god with her, hand clinging to\r\nhand, lip longing for lip, desire unsatisfied, but glad with all hope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laid hand upon hand in the lap of her gown, and looked down, and her\r\nvoice trembled as she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doth it avail to talk of this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98I know not: it may avail; for I am grieved, and shall be whilst\r\nthou art grieved; and it is my wont to strive with my griefs till I amend\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned to him with kind eyes and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O mighty man, canst thou clear away the tangle which besetteth the soul\r\nof her whose hope hath bewrayed her?  Canst thou make hope grow up in her\r\nheart?  Friend, I will tell thee that when I wed, I shall wed for the\r\nsake of the kindred, hoping for no joy therein.  Yea, or if by some\r\nchance the desire of man came again into my heart, I should strive with\r\nit to rid myself of it, for I should know of it that it was but a wasting\r\nfolly, that should but beguile me, and wound me, and depart, leaving me\r\nempty of joy and heedless of life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and said: \xe2\x80\x98Even so thou deemest now; but one day it\r\nshall be otherwise.  Or dost thou love thy sorrow?  I tell thee, as it\r\nwears thee and wears thee, thou shalt hate it, and strive to shake it\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98I love it not; for not only it grieveth me, but\r\nalso it beateth me down and belittleth me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good is that,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.  \xe2\x80\x98I know how strong thine heart is.  Now, wilt\r\nthou take mine hand, which is verily the hand of thy friend, and remember\r\nwhat I have told thee of my grief which cannot be sundered from thine?\r\nShall we not talk more concerning this?  For surely I shall soon see thee\r\nagain, and often; since the Warrior, who loveth me belike, leadeth thee\r\ninto fellowship with me.  Yea, I tell thee, O friend, that in that\r\nfellowship shalt thou find both the seed of hope, and the sun of desire\r\nthat shall quicken it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he arose and stood before her, and held out to her his hand all\r\nhardened with the sword-hilt, and she took it, and stood up facing him,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This much will I tell thee, O friend; that what I have said to thee this\r\nhour, I thought not to have said to any man; or to talk with a man of the\r\ngrief that weareth me, or to suffer him to see my tears; and marvellous I\r\ndeem it of thee, for all thy might, that thou hast drawn this speech from\r\nout of me, and left me neither angry nor ashamed, in spite of these\r\ntears; and thou whom I have known not, though thou knewest me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But now it were best that thou depart, and get thee home to the House of\r\nthe Face, where I was once so frequent; for I wot that thou hast much to\r\ndo; and as thou sayest, it will be in warfare that I shall see thee.  Now\r\nI thank thee for thy words and the thought thou hast had of me, and the\r\npain which thou hast taken to heal my hurt: I thank thee, I thank thee,\r\nfor as grievous as it is to show one\xe2\x80\x99s hurts even to a friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98O Bride, I thank thee for hearkening to my tale; and one day\r\nshall I thank thee much more.  Mayest thou fare well in the Field and\r\namidst the Folk!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he kissed her hand, and turned away, and went across the meadow\r\nand the stream, glad at heart and blithe with everyone; for kindness grew\r\nin him as gladness grew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.  OF THE FOLK-MOTE OF THE DALESMEN, THE SHEPHERD-FOLK, AND\r\nTHE WOODLAND CARLES: THE BANNER OF THE WOLF DISPLAYED.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW came the day of the Great Folk-mote, and there was much thronging\r\nfrom everywhere to the Mote-stead, but most from Burgstead itself,\r\nwhereas few of the Dale-dwellers who had been at the Fair had gone back\r\nhome.  Albeit some of the Shepherds and of the Dalesmen of the\r\nwesternmost Dale had brought light tents, and tilted themselves in in the\r\nnight before the Mote down in the meadows below the Mote-stead.  From\r\nearly morning there had been a stream of folk on the Portway setting\r\nwestward; and many came thus early that they might hold converse with\r\nfriends and well-wishers; and some that they might disport them in the\r\nwoods.  Men went in no ordered bands, as the Burgstead men at least had\r\ndone on the day of the Weapon-show, save that a few of them who were\r\narrayed the bravest gathered about the banners, and went with them to the\r\nMote-stead; for all the banners must needs be there.\r\n\r\nThe Folk-mote was to be hallowed-in three hours before noon, as all men\r\nknew; therefore an hour before that time were all men of the Dale and the\r\nShepherds assembled that might be looked for, save the Alderman and the\r\nchieftains with the banner of the Burg, and these were not like to come\r\nmany minutes before the Hallowing.  Folk were gathered on the Field in\r\nsuch wise, that the men-at-arms made a great ring round about the\r\nDoom-ring, (albeit there were many old men there, girt with swords that\r\nthey should never heave up again in battle), so that without that ring\r\nthere was nought save women and children.  But when all the other Houses\r\nwere assembled, men looked around, and beheld the place of the\r\nWoodlanders that it was empty; and they marvelled that they were thus\r\nbelated.  For now all was ready, and a watcher had gone up to the Tower\r\non the height, and had with him the great Horn of Warning, which could be\r\nheard past the Mote-stead and a great way down the Dale: and if he saw\r\nfoes coming from the East he should blow one blast; if from the South,\r\ntwo; if from the West, three; if from the North, four.\r\n\r\nSo half an hour from the appointed time of Hallowing rose the rumour that\r\nthe Alderman was on the road, and presently they of the women who were on\r\nthe outside of the throng, by drawing nigh to the edge of the sheer rock,\r\ncould behold the Banner of the Burg on the Portway, and soon after could\r\nsee the wain, done about with green boughs, wherein sat the chieftains in\r\ntheir glittering war-gear.  Speedily they spread the tidings, and a\r\nconfused shout went up into the air; and in a little while the wain\r\nstayed on Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way at the bottom of the steep slope that went up to\r\nthe Mote-stead, and the banner of the Burg came on proudly up the hill.\r\nSoon all men beheld it, and saw that the tall Hall-face bore it in front\r\nof his brother Face-of-god, who came on gleaming in war-gear better than\r\nmost men had seen; which was indeed of his father\xe2\x80\x99s fashioning, and his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s gift to him that morning.\r\n\r\nAfter Face-of-god came the Alderman, and with him Folk-might leading the\r\nSun-beam by the hand, and then Stone-face and the Elder of the\r\nDale-wardens; and then the six Burg-wardens: as to the other\r\nDale-wardens, they were in their places on the Field.\r\n\r\nSo now those who had been standing up turned their faces toward the Altar\r\nof the Gods, and those who had been sitting down sprang to their feet,\r\nand the confused rumour of the throng rose into a clear shout as the\r\nchieftains went to their places, and sat them down on the turf-seats\r\namidst the Doom-ring facing the Speech-hill and the Altar of the Gods.\r\nAmidmost sat the Alderman, on his right hand Face-of-god, and out from\r\nhim Hall-face, and then Stone-face and three of the Wardens; but on his\r\nleft hand sat first the two Guests, then the Elder of the Dale-wardens,\r\nand then the other three Burg-wardens; as for the Banner of the Burg, its\r\nstaff was stuck into the earth behind them, and the Banner raised itself\r\nin the morning wind and flapped and rippled over their heads.\r\n\r\nThere then they sat, and folk abided, and it still lacked some minutes of\r\nthe due time, as the Alderman wotted by the shadow of the great\r\nstanding-stone betwixt him and the Altar.  Therewithal came the sound of\r\na great horn from out of the wood on the north side, and men knew it for\r\nthe horn of the Woodland Carles, and were glad; for they could not think\r\nwhy they should be belated; and now men stood up a-tiptoe and on other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders to look over the heads of the women and children to behold\r\ntheir coming; but their empty place was at the southwest corner of the\r\nring of men.\r\n\r\nSo presently men beheld them marching toward their place, cleaving the\r\nthrong of the women and children, a great company; for besides that they\r\nhad with them two score more of men under weapons than on the day of the\r\nWeapon-show, all their little ones and women and outworn elders were with\r\nthem, some on foot, some riding on oxen and asses.  In their forefront\r\nwent the two signs of the Battle-shaft and the War-spear.  But moreover,\r\nin front of all was borne a great staff with the cloth of a banner\r\nwrapped round about it, and tied up with a hempen yarn that it might not\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nStark and mighty men they looked; tall and lean, broad-shouldered,\r\ndark-faced.  As they came amongst the throng the voice of their horn died\r\nout, and for a few moments they fared on with no sound save the tramp of\r\ntheir feet; then all at once the man who bare the hidden banner lifted up\r\none hand, and straightway they fell to singing, and with that song they\r\ncame to their place.  And this is some of what they sang:\r\n\r\n   O white, white Sun, what things of wonder\r\n      Hast thou beheld from thy wall of the sky!\r\n   All the Roofs of the Rich and the grief thereunder,\r\n      As the fear of the Earl-folk flitteth by!\r\n\r\n   Thou hast seen the Flame steal forth from the Forest\r\n      To slay the slumber of the lands,\r\n   As the Dusky Lord whom thou abhorrest\r\n      Clomb up to thy Burg unbuilt with hands.\r\n\r\n   Thou lookest down from thy door the golden,\r\n      Nor batest thy wide-shining mirth,\r\n   As the ramparts fall, and the roof-trees olden\r\n      Lie smouldering low on the burning earth.\r\n\r\n   When flitteth the half-dark night of summer\r\n      From the face of the murder great and grim,\r\n   \xe2\x80\x99Tis thou thyself and no new-comer\r\n      Shines golden-bright on the deed undim.\r\n\r\n   Art thou our friend, O Day-dawn\xe2\x80\x99s Lover?\r\n      Full oft thine hand hath sent aslant\r\n   Bright beams athwart the Wood-bear\xe2\x80\x99s cover,\r\n      Where the feeble folk and the nameless haunt.\r\n\r\n   Thou hast seen us quail, thou hast seen us cower,\r\n      Thou hast seen us crouch in the Green Abode,\r\n   While for us wert thou slaying slow hour by hour,\r\n      And smoothing down the war-rough road.\r\n\r\n   Yea, the rocks of the Waste were thy Dawns upheaving,\r\n      To let the days of the years go through;\r\n   And thy Noons the tangled brake were cleaving\r\n      The slow-foot seasons\xe2\x80\x99 deed to do.\r\n\r\n   Then gaze adown on this gift of our giving,\r\n      For the WOLF comes wending frith and ford,\r\n   And the Folk fares forth from the dead to the living,\r\n      For the love of the Lief by the light of the Sword.\r\n\r\nThen ceased the song, and the whole band of the Woodlanders came pouring\r\ntumultuously into the space allotted them, like the waters pouring over a\r\nriver-dam, their white swords waving aloft in the morning sunlight; and\r\nwild and strange cries rose up from amidst them, with sobbing and weeping\r\nof joy.  But soon their troubled front sank back into ordered ranks,\r\ntheir bright blades stood upright in their hands before them, and folk\r\nlooked on their company, and deemed it the very Terror of battle and\r\nRender of the ranks of war.  Right well were they armed; for though many\r\nof their weapons were ancient and somewhat worn, yet were they the work\r\nof good smiths of old days; and moreover, if any of them lacked good\r\nwar-gear of his own, that had the Alderman and his sons made good to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut before the hedge of steel stood the two tall men who held in their\r\nhands the war-tokens of the Battle-shaft and the War-spear, and betwixt\r\nthem stood one who was indeed the tallest man of the whole assembly, who\r\nheld the great staff of the hidden banner.  And now he reached up his\r\nhand, and plucked at the yarn that bound it, which of set purpose was but\r\nfeeble, and tore it off, and then shook the staff aloft with both hands,\r\nand shouted, and lo! the Banner of the Wolf with the Sun-burst behind\r\nhim, glittering-bright, new-woven by the women of the kindred, ran out in\r\nthe fresh wind, and flapped and rippled before His warriors there\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nThen from all over the Mote-stead arose an exceeding great shout, and all\r\nmen waved aloft their weapons; but the men of Shadowy Vale who were\r\nstanding amidst the men of the Face knew not how to demean themselves,\r\nand some of them ran forth into the Field and leapt for joy, tossing\r\ntheir swords into the air, and catching them by the hilts as they fell:\r\nand amidst it all the Woodlanders now stood silent, unmoving, as men\r\nabiding the word of onset.\r\n\r\nAs for that brother and sister: the Sun-beam flushed red all over her\r\nface, and pressed her hands to her bosom, and then the passion of tears\r\nover-mastered her, and her breast heaved, and the tears gushed out of her\r\neyes, and her body was shaken with weeping.  But Folk-might sat still,\r\nlooking straight before him, his eyes glittering, his teeth set, his\r\nright hand clutching hard at the hilts of his sword, which lay naked\r\nacross his knees.  And the Bride, who stood clad in her begemmed and\r\nglittering war-array in the forefront of the Men of the Steer, nigh unto\r\nthe seats of the chieftains, beheld Folk-might, and her face flushed and\r\nbrightened, and still she looked upon him.  The Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s face was as of\r\none pleased and proud; yet was its joy shadowed as it were by a cloud of\r\ncompassion.  Face-of-god sat like the very image of the War-god, and\r\nstirred not, nor looked toward the Sun-beam; for still the thought of the\r\nafter-grief of battle, and the death of friends and folk that loved him,\r\nlay heavy on his heart, for all that it beat wildly at the shouting of\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.  OF THE GREAT FOLK-MOTE: ATONEMENTS GIVEN, AND MEN MADE\r\nSACKLESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMIDST the clamour uprose the Alderman; for it was clear to all men that\r\nthe Folk-mote should be holden at once, and the matters of the War, and\r\nthe Fellowship, and the choosing of the War-leader, speedily dealt with.\r\nSo the Alderman fell to hallowing in the Folk-mote: he went up to the\r\nAltar of the Gods, and took the Gold-ring off it, and did it on his arm;\r\nthen he drew his sword and waved it toward the four a\xc3\xadrts, and spake; and\r\nthe noise and shouting fell, and there was silence but for him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Herewith I hallow in this Folk-mote of the Men of the Dale and the\r\nSheepcotes and the Woodland, in the name of the Warrior and the Earth-god\r\nand the Fathers of the kindreds.  Now let not the peace of the Mote be\r\nbroken.  Let not man rise against man, or bear blade or hand, or stick or\r\nstone against any.  If any man break the Peace of the Holy Mote, let him\r\nbe a man accursed, a wild-beast in the Holy Places; an outcast from home\r\nand hearth, from bed and board, from mead and acre; not to be holpen with\r\nbread, nor flesh, nor wine; nor flax, nor wool, nor any cloth; nor with\r\nsword, nor shield, nor axe, nor plough-share; nor with horse, nor ox, nor\r\nass; with no saddle-beast nor draught-beast; nor with wain, nor boat, nor\r\nway-leading; nor with fire nor water; nor with any world\xe2\x80\x99s wealth.  Thus\r\nlet him who hath cast out man be cast out by man.  Now is hallowed-in the\r\nFolk-mote of the Men of the Dale and the Sheepcotes and the Woodlands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he waved his sword again toward the four a\xc3\xadrts, and went and\r\nsat down in his place.  But presently he arose again, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now if man hath aught to say against man, and claimeth boot of any, or\r\nwould lay guilt on any man\xe2\x80\x99s head, let him come forth and declare it; and\r\nthe judges shall be named, and the case shall be tried this afternoon or\r\nto-morrow.  Yet first I shall tell you that I, the Alderman of the\r\nDalesmen, doomed one Iron-face of the House of the Face to pay a double\r\nfine, for that he drew a sword at the Gate-thing of Burgstead with the\r\nintent to break the peace thereof.  Thou, Green-sleeve, bring forth the\r\npeace-breaker\xe2\x80\x99s fine, that Iron-face may lay the same on the Altar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen came forth a man from the men of the Face bearing a bag, and he\r\nbrought it to Iron-face, who went up to the Altar and poured forth\r\nweighed gold from the bag thereon, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Warden of the Dale, come thou and weigh it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth the Warden, \xe2\x80\x98it needeth not, no man here doubteth thee,\r\nAlderman Iron-face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA murmur of yeasay went up, and none had a word to say against the\r\nAlderman, but they praised him rather: also men were eager to hear of the\r\nwar, and the fellowship, and to be done with these petty matters.  Then\r\nthe Alderman rose again and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hath any man a grief against any other of the Kindreds of the Dale, or\r\nthe Sheepcotes, or the Woodlands?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNone answered or stirred; so after he had waited a while, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there any who hath any guilt to lay against a Stranger, an Outlander,\r\nbeing such a man as he deems we can come at?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereat was a stir amongst the Men of the Fleece of the Shepherds, and\r\ntheir ranks opened, and there came forth an ill-favoured lean old man,\r\nlong-nebbed, blear-eyed, and bent, girt with a rusty old sword, but not\r\notherwise armed.  And all men knew Penny-thumb, who had been ransacked\r\nlast autumn.  As he came forth, it seemed as if his neighbours had been\r\ntrying to hold him back; but a stout, broad-shouldered man, black-haired\r\nand red-bearded, made way for the old man, and led him out of the throng,\r\nand stood by him; and this man was well armed at all points, and looked a\r\ndoughty carle.  He stood side by side with Penny-thumb, right in front of\r\nthe men of his house, and looked about him at first somewhat uneasily, as\r\nthough he were ashamed of his fellow; but though many smiled, none\r\nlaughed aloud; and they forbore, partly because they knew the man to be a\r\ngood man, partly because of the solemn tide of the Folk-mote, and partly\r\nin sooth because they wished all this to be over, and were as men who had\r\nno time for empty mirth.\r\n\r\nThen said the Alderman: \xe2\x80\x98What wouldest thou, Penny-thumb, and thou,\r\nBristler, son of Brightling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Penny-thumb began to speak in a high squeaky voice: \xe2\x80\x98Alderman, and\r\nLord of the Folk!\xe2\x80\x99  But therewithal Bristle, pulled him back, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am the man who hath taken this quarrel upon me, and have sworn upon\r\nthe Holy Boar to carry this feud through; and we deem, Alderman, that if\r\nthey who slew Rusty and ransacked Penny-thumb be not known now, yet they\r\nsoon may be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spake, came forth those three men of the Shepherds and the two\r\nDalesmen who had sworn with him on the Holy Boar.  Then up stood\r\nFolk-might, and came forth into the field, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bristler, son of Brightling, and ye other good men and true, it is but\r\nsooth that the ransackers and the slayer may soon be known; and here I\r\ndeclare them unto you: I it was and none other who slew Rusty; and I was\r\nthe leader of those who ransacked Penny-thumb, and cowed Harts-bane of\r\nGreentofts.  As for the slaying of Rusty, I slew him because he chased\r\nme, and would not forbear, so that I must either slay or be slain, as\r\nhath befallen me erewhile, and will befall again, methinks.  As for the\r\nransacking of Penny-thumb, I needed the goods that I took, and he needed\r\nthem not, since he neither used them, nor gave them away, and, they being\r\ngone, he hath lived no worser than aforetime.  Now I say, that if ye will\r\ntake the outlawry off me, which, as I hear, ye laid upon me, not knowing\r\nme, then will I handsel self-doom to thee, Bristler, if thou wilt bear\r\nthy grief to purse, and I will pay thee what thou wilt out of hand; or if\r\nperchance thou wilt call me to Holm, thither will I go, if thou and I\r\ncome unslain out of this war.  As to the ransacking and cowing of\r\nHarts-bane, I say that I am sackless therein, because the man is but a\r\nruffler and a man of violence, and hath cowed many men of the Dale; and\r\nif he gainsay me, then do I call him to the Holm after this war is over;\r\neither him or any man who will take his place before my sword.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he held his peace, and man spake to man, and a murmur arose, as they\r\nsaid for the more part that it was a fair and manly offer.  But Bristler\r\ncalled his fellows and Penny-thumb to him, and they spake together; and\r\nsometimes Penny-thumb\xe2\x80\x99s shrill squeak was heard above the deep-voiced\r\ntalk of the others; for he was a man that harboured malice.  But at last\r\nBristler spake out and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tall man, we know that thou art a chieftain and of good will to the men\r\nof the Dale and their friends, and that want drave thee to the\r\nransacking, and need to the manslaying, and neither the living nor the\r\ndead to whom thou art guilty are to be called good men; therefore will I\r\nbring the matter to purse, if thou wilt handsel me self-doom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, even so let it be,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Folk-might; and stepped forward and took\r\nBristler by the hand, and handselled him self-doom.  Then said Bristler:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Though Rusty was no good man, and though he followed thee to slay thee,\r\nyet was he in his right therein, since he was following up his goodman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngear; therefore shalt thou pay a full blood-wite for him, that is to say,\r\nthe worth of three hundreds in weed-stuff in whatso goods thou wilt.  As\r\nfor the ransacking of Penny-thumb, he shall deem himself well paid if\r\nthou give him our hundreds in weed-stuff for that which thou didst borrow\r\nof him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Penny-thumb set up his squeak again, but no man hearkened to him,\r\nand each man said to his neighbour that it was well doomed of Bristler,\r\nand neither too much nor too little.  But Folk-might bade Wood-wont to\r\nbring thither to him that which he had borne to the Mote; and he brought\r\nforth a big sack, and Folk-might emptied it on the earth, and lo! the\r\nsilver rings of the slain felons, and they lay in a heap on the green\r\nfield, and they were the best of silver.  Then the Elder of the\r\nDale-wardens weighed out from the heap the blood-wite for Rusty,\r\naccording to the due measure of the hundred in weed-stuff, and delivered\r\nit unto Bristler.  And Folk-might said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Draw nigh now, Penny-thumb, and take what thou wilt of this gear, which\r\nI need not, and grudge not at me henceforward.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Penny-thumb was afraid, and abode where he was; and Bristler laughed,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Take it, goodman, take it; spare not other men\xe2\x80\x99s goods as thou\r\ndost thine own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Folk-might stood by, smiling faintly: so Penny-thumb plucked up a\r\nheart, and drew nigh trembling, and took what he durst from that heap;\r\nand all that stood by said that he had gotten a full double of what had\r\nbeen awarded to him.  But as for him, he went his ways straight from the\r\nMote-stead, and made no stay till he had gotten him home, and laid the\r\nsilver up in a strong coffer; and thereafter he bewailed him sorely that\r\nhe had not taken the double of that which he took, since none would have\r\nsaid him nay.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, the Alderman arose and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, since the fines have been paid duly and freely, according to the\r\ndooming of Bristler, take we off the outlawry from Folk-might and his\r\nfellows, and account them to be sackless before us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he called for other cases; but no man had aught more to bring\r\nforward against any man, either of the kindreds or the Strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.  OF THE GREAT FOLK-MOTE: MEN TAKE REDE OF THE WAR-FARING,\r\nTHE FELLOWSHIP, AND THE WAR-LEADER.  FOLK-MIGHT TELLETH WHENCE HIS PEOPLE\r\nCAME.  THE FOLK-MOTE SUNDERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW a great silence fell upon the throng, and they stood as men abiding\r\nsome new matter.  Unto them arose the Alderman, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men of the Dale, and ye Shepherds and Woodlanders; it is well known to\r\nyou that we have foemen in the wood and beyond it; and now have we gotten\r\nsure tidings, that they will not abide at home or in the wood, but are\r\nminded to fall upon us at home.  Now therefore I will not ask you whether\r\nye will have peace or war; for with these foemen ye may have peace no\r\notherwise save by war.  But if ye think with me, three things have ye to\r\ndetermine: first, whether ye will abide your foes in your own houses, or\r\nwill go meet them at theirs; next, whether ye will take to you as fellows\r\nin arms a valiant folk of the children of the Gods, who are foemen to our\r\nfoemen; and lastly, what man ye will have to be your War-leader.  Now, I\r\nbid all those here assembled, to speak hereof, any man of them that will,\r\neither what they may have conceived in their own minds, or what their\r\nkindred may have put into their mouths to speak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he sat down, and in a little while came forth old Hall-ward of\r\nthe House of the Steer, and stood before the Alderman, and said: \xe2\x80\x98O\r\nAlderman, all we say: Since war is awake we will not tarry, but will go\r\nmeet our foes while it is yet time.  The valiant men of whom thou tellest\r\nshall be our fellows, were there but three of them.  We know no better\r\nWar-leader than Face-of-god of the House of the Face.  Let him lead us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he went his ways; and next came forth War-well, and said: \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nHouse of the Bridge would have Face-of-god for War-leader, these tall men\r\nfor fellows, and the shortest way to meet the foe.\xe2\x80\x99  And he went back to\r\nhis place.\r\n\r\nNext came Fox of Upton, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Time presses, or much might be spoken.\r\nThus saith the House of the Bull: Let us go meet the foe, and take these\r\nvaliant strangers for way-leaders, and Face-of-god for War-leader.\xe2\x80\x99  And\r\nhe also went back again.\r\n\r\nThen came forth two men together, an old man and a young, and the old man\r\nspake as soon as he stood still: \xe2\x80\x98The Men of the Vine bid me say their\r\nwill: They will not stay at home to have their houses burned over their\r\nheads, themselves slain on their own hearths, and their wives haled off\r\nto thralldom.  They will take any man for their fellow in arms who will\r\nsmite stark strokes on their side.  They know Face-of-god, and were\r\nliefer of him for War-leader than any other, and they will follow him\r\nwheresoever he leadeth.  Thus my kindred biddeth me say, and I hight\r\nFork-beard of Lea.  If I live through this war, I shall have lived\r\nthrough five.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he went back to his place; but the young man lifted up his\r\nvoice and said: \xe2\x80\x98To all this I say yea, and so am I bidden by the kindred\r\nof the Sickle.  I am Red-beard of the Knolls, the son of my father.\xe2\x80\x99  And\r\nhe went to his place again.\r\n\r\nThen came forth Stone-face, and said: \xe2\x80\x98The House of the Face saith: Lead\r\nus through the wood, O Face-of-god, thou War-leader, and ye warriors of\r\nthe Wolf.  I am Stone-face, as men know, and this word hath been given to\r\nme by the kindred.\xe2\x80\x99  And he took his place again.\r\n\r\nThen came forth together the three chiefs of the Shepherds, to wit\r\nHound-under-Greenbury, Strongitharm, and the Hyllier; and Strongitharm\r\nspake for all three, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Men of Greenbury, and they of the Fleece and the Thorn, are of one\r\naccord, and bid us say that they are well pleased to have Face-of-god for\r\nWar-leader; and that they will follow him and the warriors of the Wolf to\r\nlive or die with them; and that they are ready to go meet the foe at\r\nonce, and will not skulk behind the walls of Greenbury.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith the three went back again to their places.\r\n\r\nThen came forth that tall man that bare the Banner of the Wolf, when he\r\nhad given the staff into the hands of him who stood next.  He came and\r\nstood over against the seat of the chieftains; and for a while he could\r\nsay no word, but stood struggling with the strong passion of his joy; but\r\nat last he lifted his hands aloft, and cried out in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O war, war!  O death!  O wounding and grief!  O loss of friends and\r\nkindred! let all this be rather than the drawing back of meeting hands\r\nand the sundering of yearning hearts!\xe2\x80\x99 and he went back hastily to his\r\nplace.  But from the ranks of the Woodlanders ran forth a young man, and\r\ncried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As is the word of Red-wolf, so is my word, Bears-bane of Carlstead; and\r\nthis is the word which our little Folk hath put into our mouths; and O!\r\nthat our hands may show the meaning of our mouths; for nought else can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen indeed went up a great shout, though many forebore to cry out; for\r\nnow were they too much moved for words or sounds.  And in special was\r\nFace-of-god moved; and he scarce knew which way to look, lest he should\r\nbreak out into sobs and weeping; for of late he had been much among the\r\nWoodlanders, and loved them much.\r\n\r\nThen all the noise and clamour fell, and it was to men as if they who had\r\ncome thither a folk, had now become an host of war.\r\n\r\nBut once again the Alderman rose up and spake:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now have ye yeasaid three things: That we take Face-of-god of the House\r\nof the Face for our War-leader; that we fare under weapons at once\r\nagainst them who would murder us; and that we take the valiant Folk of\r\nthe Wolf for our fellows in arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he stayed his speech, and this time the shout arose clear and\r\nmost mighty, with the tossing up of swords and the clashing of weapons on\r\nshields.\r\n\r\nThen he said: \xe2\x80\x98Now, if any man will speak, here is the War-leader, and\r\nhere is the chief of our new friends, to answer to whatso any of the\r\nkindred would have answered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereon came forth the Fiddle from amongst the Men of the Sickle, and\r\ndrew somewhat nigh to the Alderman, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alderman, we would ask of the War-leader if he hath devised the manner\r\nof our assembling, and the way of our war-faring, and the day of our\r\nhosting.  More than this I will not ask of him, because we wot that in so\r\ngreat an assembly it may be that the foe may have some spy of whom we wot\r\nnot; and though this be not likely, yet some folk may babble; therefore\r\nit is best for the wise to be wise everywhere and always.  Therefore my\r\nrede it is, that no man ask any more concerning this, but let it lie with\r\nthe War-leader to bring us face to face with the foe as speedily as he\r\nmay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll men said that this was well counselled.  But Face-of-god arose and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Ye Men of the Dale, ye Shepherds and Woodlanders, meseemeth the\r\nFiddle hath spoken wisely.  Now therefore I answer him and say, that I\r\nhave so ordered everything since the Gate-thing was holden at Burgstead,\r\nthat we may come face to face with the foemen by the shortest of roads.\r\nEvery man shall be duly summoned to the Hosting, and if any man fail, let\r\nit be accounted a shame to him for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA great shout followed on his words, and he sat down again.  But Fox of\r\nUpton came forth and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Alderman, we have yeasaid the fellowship of the valiant men who have\r\ncome to us from out of the waste; but this we have done, not because we\r\nhave known them, otherwise than by what our kinsman Face-of-god hath told\r\nus concerning them, but because we have seen clearly that they will be of\r\nmuch avail to us in our warfare.  Now, therefore, if the tall chieftain\r\nwho sitteth beside thee were to do us to wit what he is, and whence he\r\nand his are come, it were well, and fain were we thereof; but if he\r\nlisteth not to tell us, that also shall be well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen arose Folk-might in his place; but or ever he could open his mouth\r\nto speak, the tall Red-wolf strode forward bearing with him the Banner of\r\nthe Wolf and the Sun-burst, and came and stood beside him; and the wind\r\nran through the folds of the banner, and rippled it out above the heads\r\nof those twain.  Then Folk-might spake and said:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98O Men of the Dale and the Sheepcotes, I will do as ye bid me do;\r\n   And fain were ye of the story if every deal ye knew.\r\n   But long, long were its telling, were I to tell it all:\r\n   Let it bide till the Cup of Deliverance ye drink from hall to hall.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98Like you we be of the kindreds, of the Sons of the Gods we come,\r\n   Midst the Mid-earth\xe2\x80\x99s mighty Woodland of old we had our home;\r\n   But of older time we abided \xe2\x80\x99neath the mountains of the Earth,\r\n   O\xe2\x80\x99er which the Sun ariseth to waken woe and mirth.\r\n\r\n   Great were we then and many; but the long days wore us thin,\r\n   And war, wherein the winner hath weary work to win.\r\n   And the woodland wall behind us e\xe2\x80\x99en like ourselves was worn,\r\n   And the tramp of the hosts of the foemen adown its glades was borne\r\n   On the wind that bent our wheat-fields.  So in the morn we rose,\r\n   And left behind the stubble and the autumn-fruited close,\r\n   And went our ways to the westward, nor turned aback to see\r\n   The glare of our burning houses rise over brake and tree.\r\n   But the foe was fierce and speedy, nor long they tarried there,\r\n   And through the woods of battle our laden wains must fare;\r\n   And the Sons of the Wolf were minished, and the maids of the Wolf\r\n   waxed few,\r\n   As amidst the victory-singing we fared the wild-wood through.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98So saith the ancient story, that west and west we went,\r\n   And many a day of battle we had in brake, on bent;\r\n   Whilst here a while we tarried, and there we hastened on,\r\n   And still the battle-harvest from many a folk we won.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98Of the tale of the days who wotteth?  Of the years what man can tell,\r\n   While the Sons of the Wolf were wandering, and knew not where to\r\n   dwell?\r\n   But at last we clomb the mountains, and mickle was our toil,\r\n   As high the spear-wood clambered of the drivers of the spoil;\r\n   And tangled were the passes and the beacons flared behind,\r\n   And the horns of gathering onset came up upon the wind.\r\n   So saith the ancient story, that we stood in a mountain-cleft,\r\n   Where the ways and the valleys sundered to the right hand and the\r\n   left.\r\n   There in the place of sundering all woeful was the rede;\r\n   We knew no land before us, and behind was heavy need.\r\n   As the sword cleaves through the byrny, so there the mountain flank\r\n   Cleft through the God-kin\xe2\x80\x99s people; and ne\xe2\x80\x99er again we drank\r\n   The wine of war together, or feasted side by side\r\n   In the Feast-hall of the Warrior on the fruit of the battle-tide.\r\n   For there we turned and sundered; unto the North we went\r\n   And up along the waters, and the clattering stony bent;\r\n   And unto the South and the Sheepcotes down went our sister\xe2\x80\x99s sons;\r\n   And O for the years passed over since we saw those valiant ones!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and laid his right hand on the banner-staff a little below the\r\nleft hand of Red-wolf; and men were so keen to hear each word that he\r\nspake, that there was no cry nor sound of voices when he had done, only\r\nthe sound of the rippling banner of the Wolf over the heads of those\r\ntwain.  The Sun-beam bowed her head now, and wept silently.  But the\r\nBride, she had drawn her sword, and held it upright in her hand before\r\nher, and the sun smote fire from out of it.\r\n\r\nThen it was but a little while before Red-wolf lifted up his voice, and\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98Hearken a wonder, O Folk of the Field,\r\n   How they that did sunder stand shield beside shield!\r\n\r\n   Lo! the old wont and manner by fearless folk made,\r\n   On the Bole of the Banner the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 hands laid.\r\n\r\n   Lo! here the token of what hath betid!\r\n   Grown whole is the broken, found that which was hid.\r\n\r\n   Now one way we follow whate\xe2\x80\x99er shall befall;\r\n   As seeketh the swallow his yesteryear\xe2\x80\x99s hall.\r\n\r\n   Seldom folk fewer to fight-stead hath fared;\r\n   Ne\xe2\x80\x99er have men truer the battle-reed bared.\r\n\r\n   Grey locks now I carry, and old am I grown,\r\n   Nor looked I to tarry to meet with mine own.\r\n\r\n   For we who remember the deeds of old days\r\n   Were nought but the ember of battle ablaze.\r\n\r\n   For what man might aid us? what deed and what day\r\n   Should come where Weird laid us aloof from the way?\r\n\r\n   What man save that other of Twain rent apart,\r\n   Our war-friend, our Brother, the piece of our heart.\r\n\r\n   Then hearken the wonder how shield beside shield\r\n   The twain that did sunder wend down to the Field!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow when he had made an end, men could no longer forebear the shout; and\r\nit went up into the heavens, and was borne by the west-wind down the Dale\r\nto the ears of the stay-at-home women and men unmeet to go abroad, and it\r\nquickened their blood and the spirits within them as they heard it, and\r\nthey smiled and were fain; for they knew that their kinsfolk were glad.\r\n\r\nBut when there was quiet on the Mote-field again, Folk-might spake again\r\nand said;\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98It is sooth that my Brother sayeth, and that now again we wend,\r\n   All the Sons of the Wolf together, till the trouble hath an end.\r\n   But as for that tale of the Ancients, it saith that we who went\r\n   To the northward, climbed and stumbled o\xe2\x80\x99er many a stony bent,\r\n   Till we happed on that isle of the waste-land, and the grass of\r\n   Shadowy Vale,\r\n   Where we dwelt till we throve a little, and felt our might avail.\r\n   Then we fared abroad from the shadow and the little-lighted hold,\r\n   And the increase fell to the valiant, and the spoil to the\r\n   battle-bold,\r\n   And never a man gainsaid us with the weapons in our hands;\r\n   And in Silver-dale the happy we gat us life and lands.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98So wore the years o\xe2\x80\x99er-wealthy; and meseemeth that ye know\r\n   How we sowed and reaped destruction, and the Day of the overthrow:\r\n   How we leaned on the staff we had broken, and put our lives in the\r\n   hand\r\n   Of those whom we had vanquished and the feeble of the land;\r\n   And these were the stone of stumbling, and the burden not to be borne,\r\n   When the battle-blast fell on us and our day was over-worn.\r\n   Thus then did our wealth bewray us, and left us wise and sad;\r\n   And to you, bold men, it falleth once more to make us glad,\r\n   If so your hearts are bidding, and ye deem the deed of worth.\r\n   Such were we; what we shall be, \xe2\x80\x99tis yours to say henceforth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said furthermore: \xe2\x80\x98How great we have been I have told you already; and\r\nye shall see for yourselves how little we be now.  Is it enough, and will\r\nye have us for friends and brothers?  How say ye?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey answered with shout upon shout, so that all the place and the\r\nwild-wood round about was full of the voice of their crying; but when the\r\nclamour fell, then spake the Alderman and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friend, and chieftain of the Wolf, thou mayst hear by this shouting of\r\nthe people that we have no mind to naysay our yea-say.  And know that it\r\nis not our use and manner to seek the strong for friends, and to thrust\r\naside the weak; but rather to choose for our friends them who are of like\r\nmind to us, men in whom we put our trust.  From henceforth then there is\r\nbrotherhood between us; we are yours, and ye are ours; and let this\r\nendure for ever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen were all men full of joy; and now at last the battle seemed at hand,\r\nand the peace beyond the battle.\r\n\r\nThen men brought the hallowed beasts all garlanded with flowers into the\r\nDoom-ring, and there were they slain and offered up unto the Gods, to wit\r\nthe Warrior, the Earth-god, and the Fathers; and thereafter was solemn\r\nfeast holden on the Field of the Folk-mote, and all men were fain and\r\nmerry.  Nevertheless, not all men abode there the feast through; for or\r\never the afternoon was well worn, were many men wending along the Portway\r\neastward toward the Upper Dale, each man in his war-gear and with a scrip\r\nhung about him; and these were they who were bound for the trysting-place\r\nand the journey over the waste.\r\n\r\nSo the Folk-mote was sundered; and men went to their houses, and there\r\nabode in peace the time of their summoning; since they wotted well that\r\nthe Hosting was afoot.\r\n\r\nBut as for the Woodlanders, who were at the Mote-stead with all their\r\nfolk, women, children, and old men, they went not back again to\r\nCarlstead; but prayed the neighbours of the Middle Dale to suffer them to\r\nabide there awhile, which they yeasaid with a good will.  So the\r\nWoodlanders tilted themselves in, the more part of them, down in the\r\nmeadows below the Mote-stead, along either side of Wildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way; but\r\ntheir ancient folk, and some of the women and children, the neighbours\r\nwould have into their houses, and the rest they furnished with victual\r\nand all that they needed without price, looking upon them as their very\r\nguests.  For indeed they deemed that they could see that these men would\r\nnever return to Carlstead, but would abide with the Men of the Wolf in\r\nSilver-dale, once it were won.  And this they deemed but meet and right,\r\nyet were they sorry thereof; for the Woodlanders were well beloved of all\r\nthe Dalesmen; and now that they had gotten to know that they were come of\r\nso noble a kindred, they were better beloved yet, and more looked upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.  OF THE HOSTING IN SHADOWY VALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was on the evening of the fourth day after the Folk-mote that there\r\ncame through the Waste to the rocky edge of Shadowy Vale a band of some\r\nfifteen score of men-at-arms, and with them a multitude of women and\r\nchildren and old men, some afoot, some riding on asses and bullocks; and\r\nwith them were sumpter asses and neat laden with household goods, and a\r\nfew goats and kine.  And this was the whole folk of the Woodlanders come\r\nto the Hosting in Shadowy Vale and the Home of the Children of the Wolf.\r\nTheir leaders of the way were Wood-father and Wood-wont and two other\r\ncarles of Shadowy Vale; and Red-wolf the tall, and Bears-bane and\r\nWar-grove were the captains and chieftains of their company.\r\n\r\nThus then they entered into the narrow pass aforesaid, which was the\r\ningate to the Vale from the Waste, and little by little its dimness\r\nswallowed up their long line.  As they went by the place where the\r\nlowering of the rock-wall gave a glimpse of the valley, they looked down\r\ninto it as Face-of-god had done, but much change was there in little\r\ntime.  There was the black wall of crags on the other side stretching\r\ndown to the ghyll of the great Force; there ran the deep green waters of\r\nthe Shivering Flood; but the grass which Face-of-god had seen naked of\r\neverything but a few kine, thereon now the tents of men stood thick.\r\nTheir hearts swelled within them as they beheld it, but they forebore the\r\nshout and the cry till they should be well within the Vale, and so went\r\ndown silently into the darkness.  But as their eyes caught that dim image\r\nof the Wolf on the wall of the pass, man pointed it out to man, and not a\r\nfew turned and kissed it hurriedly; and to them it seemed that many a\r\nkiss had been laid on that dear token since the days of old, and that the\r\nhard stone had been worn away by the fervent lips of men, and that the\r\nair of the mirk place yet quivered with the vows sworn over the\r\nsword-blade.\r\n\r\nBut down through the dark they went, and so came on to the stony scree at\r\nthe end of the pass and into the Vale; and the whole Folk save the three\r\nchieftains flowed over it and stood about it down on the level grass of\r\nthe Vale.  But those three stood yet on the top of the scree, bearing the\r\nwar-signs of the Shaft and the Spear, and betwixt them the banner of the\r\nWolf and the Sunburst newly displayed to the winds of Shadowy Vale.\r\n\r\nUp and down the Vale they looked, and saw before the tents of men the old\r\nfamiliar banners of Burgdale rising and falling in the evening wind.  But\r\namidst of the Doom-ring was pitched a great banner, whereon was done the\r\nimage of the Wolf with red gaping jaws on a field of green; and about him\r\nstood other banners, to wit, The Silver Arm on a red field, the Red Hand\r\non a white field, and on green fields both, the Golden Bushel and the\r\nRagged Sword.\r\n\r\nAll about the plain shone glittering war-gear of men as they moved hither\r\nand thither, and a stream of folk began at once to draw toward the scree\r\nto look on those new-comers; and amidst the helmed Burgdalers and the\r\nwhite-coated Shepherds went the tall men of the Wolf, bare-headed and\r\nunarmed save for their swords, mingled with the fair strong women of the\r\nkindred, treading barefoot the soft grass of their own Vale.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a great throng gathered round about the Woodlanders,\r\nand each man as he joined it waved hand or weapon toward them, and the\r\njoy of their welcome sent a confused clamour through the air.  Then forth\r\nfrom the throng stepped Folk-might, unarmed save his sword, and behind\r\nhim was Face-of-god, in his war-gear save his helm, hand in hand with the\r\nSun-beam, who was clad in her goodly flowered green kirtle, her feet\r\nnaked like her sisters of the kindred.\r\n\r\nThen Folk-might cried aloud: \xe2\x80\x98A full and free greeting to our brothers!\r\nWell be ye, O Sons of our Ancient Fathers!  And to-day are ye the dearer\r\nto us because we see that ye have brought us a gift, to wit, your wives\r\nand children, and your grandsires unmeet for war.  By this token we see\r\nhow great is your trust in us, and that it is your meaning never to\r\nsunder from us again.  O well be ye; well be ye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen spake Red-wolf, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Ye Sons of the Wolf, who parted from us\r\nof old time in that cleft of the mountains, it is our very selves that we\r\ngive unto you; and these are a part of ourselves; how then should we\r\nleave them behind us?  Bear witness, O men of Burgdale and the\r\nSheepcotes, that we have become one Folk with the men of Shadowy Vale,\r\nnever to be sundered again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen all that multitude shouted with a loud voice; and when the shout had\r\ndied away, Folk-might spake again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Warriors of the Sundering, here shall your wives and children abide,\r\nwhile we go a little journey to rejoice our hearts with the hard\r\nhandplay, and take to us that which we have missed: and to-morrow morn is\r\nappointed for this same journey, unless ye be over foot-weary with the\r\nways of the Waste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRed-wolf smiled as he answered: \xe2\x80\x98This ye say in jest, brother; for ye may\r\nsee that our day\xe2\x80\x99s journey hath not been over-much for our old men; how\r\nthen should it weary those who may yet bear sword?  We are ready for the\r\nroad and eager for the handplay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98and what was to be looked for.\r\nTherefore, brother, do ye and your counsel-mates come straightway to the\r\nHall of the Wolf; wherein, after ye have eaten and drunken, shall we take\r\ncounsel with our brethren of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, so that all may\r\nbe ordered for battle!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Red-wolf: \xe2\x80\x98Good is that, if we must needs abide till to-morrow; for\r\nverily we came not hither to eat and drink and rest our bodies; but it\r\nmust be as ye will have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the Sun-beam left the hand of Face-of-god and came forward, and held\r\nout both her palms to the Woodland-folk, and spake in a voice that was\r\nheard afar, though it were a woman\xe2\x80\x99s, so clear and sweet it was; and she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Warriors of the Sundering, ye who be not needed in the Hall, and ye\r\nour sisters with your little ones and your fathers, come now to us and\r\ndown to the tents which we have arrayed for you, and there think for a\r\nlittle that we are all at our very home that we long for and have yet to\r\nwin, and be ye merry with us and make us merry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she stepped forward daintily and entered into their throng, and\r\ntook an old man of the Woodlanders by the hand, and kissed his cheek and\r\nled him away, and the coming rest seemed sweet to him.  And then came\r\nother women of the Vale, kind and fair and smiling, and led away, some an\r\nold mother of the Wood-landers, some a young wife, some a pair of lads;\r\nand not a few forsooth kissed and embraced the stark warriors, and went\r\naway with them toward the tents, which stood along the side of the\r\nShivering Flood where it was at its quietest; for there was the grass the\r\nsoftest and most abundant.  There on the green grass were tables arrayed,\r\nand lamps were hung above them on spears, to be litten when the daylight\r\nshould fail.  And the best of the victual which the Vale could give was\r\nspread on the boards, along with wine and dainties, bought in\r\nSilver-dale, or on the edges of the Westland with sword-strokes and\r\narrow-flight.\r\n\r\nThere then they feasted and were merry; and the Sun-beam and Bow-may and\r\nthe other women of the Vale served them at table, and were very blithe\r\nwith them, caressing them with soft words, and with clipping and kissing,\r\nas folk who were grown exceeding dear to them; so that that eve of battle\r\nwas softer and sweeter to them than any hour of their life.  With these\r\nfeasters were God-swain and Spear-fist of the delivered thralls of\r\nSilver-dale as glad as glad might be; but Wolf-stone their eldest was\r\ngone with Dallach to the Council in the Hall.\r\n\r\nThe men of Burgdale and the Shepherds feasted otherwhere in all content,\r\nnor lacked folk of the Vale to serve them.  Amongst the men of the Face\r\nwere the ten delivered thralls who had heart to meet their masters in\r\narms: seven of them were of Rose-dale and three of Silver-dale.\r\n\r\nThe Bride was with her kindred of the Steer, with whom were many men of\r\nShadowy Vale, and she served her friends and fellows clad in her\r\nwar-gear, save helm and hauberk, bearing herself as one who is serving\r\ndear guests.  And men equalled her for her beauty to the Gods of the High\r\nPlace and the Choosers of the Slain; and they who had not beheld her\r\nbefore marvelled at her, and her loveliness held all men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts in a\r\nnet of desire, so that they forebore their meat to gaze upon her; and if\r\nperchance her hand touched some young man, or her cheek or sweet-breathed\r\nmouth came nigh to his face, he became bewildered and wist not where he\r\nwas, nor what to do.  Yet was she as lowly and simple of speech and\r\ndemeanour as if she were a gooseherd of fourteen winters.\r\n\r\nIn the Hall was a goodly company, and all the leaders of the Folk were\r\ntherein, and Folk-might and the War-leader sitting in the midst of those\r\nstone seats on the days.  There then they agreed on the whole ordering of\r\nthe battle and the wending of the host, as shall be told later on; and\r\nthis matter was long a-doing, and when it was done, men went to their\r\nplaces to sleep, for the night was well worn.\r\n\r\nBut when men had departed and all was still, Folk-might, light-clad and\r\nwithout a weapon, left the Hall and walked briskly toward the nether end\r\nof the Vale.  He passed by all the tents, the last whereof were of the\r\nHouse of the Steer, and came to a place where was a great rock rising\r\nstraight up from the plain like sheaves of black staves standing close\r\ntogether; and it was called Staff-stone, and tales of the elves had been\r\ntold concerning it, so that Stone-face had beheld it gladly the day\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe moon was just shining into Shadowy Vale, and the grass was bright\r\nwheresoever the shadows of the high cliffs were not, and the face of\r\nStaff-stone shone bright grey as Folk-might came within sight of it, and\r\nhe beheld someone sitting at the base of the rock, and as he drew nigher\r\nhe saw that it was a woman, and knew her for the Bride; for he had prayed\r\nher to abide him there that night, because it was nigh to the tents of\r\nthe House of the Steer; and his heart was glad as he drew nigh to her.\r\n\r\nShe sat quietly on a fragment of the black rock, clad as she had been all\r\nday, in her glittering kirtle, but without hauberk or helm, a wreath of\r\nwind-flowers about her head, her feet crossed over each other, her hands\r\nlaid palm uppermost in her lap.  She moved not as he drew nigh, but said\r\nin a gentle voice when he was close to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chief of the Wolf, great warrior, thou wouldest speak with me; and good\r\nit is that friends should talk together on the eve of battle, when they\r\nmay never meet alive again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98My talk shall not be long; for thou and I both must sleep\r\nto-night, since there is work to hand to-morrow.  Now since, as thou\r\nsayest, O fairest of women, we may never meet again alive, I ask thee now\r\nat this hour, when we both live and are near to one another, to suffer me\r\nto speak to thee of my love of thee and desire for thee.  Surely thou,\r\nwho art the sweetest of all things the Gods and the kindreds have made,\r\nwilt not gainsay me this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said very sweetly, yet smiling: \xe2\x80\x98Brother of my father\xe2\x80\x99s sons, how can\r\nI gainsay thee thy speech?  Nay, hast thou not said it?  What more canst\r\nthou add to it that will have fresh meaning to mine ears?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Thou sayest sooth: might I then but kiss thine hand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said, no longer smiling: \xe2\x80\x98Yea surely, even so may all men do who can\r\nbe called my friends\xe2\x80\x94and thou art much my friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and kissed it, and held it thereafter; nor did she draw\r\nit away.  The moon shone brightly on them; but by its light he could not\r\nsee if she reddened, but he deemed that her face was troubled.  Then he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98It were better for me if I might kiss thy face, and take thee in\r\nmine arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen said she: \xe2\x80\x98This only shall a man do with me when I long to do the\r\nlike with him.  And since thou art so much my friend, I will tell thee\r\nthat as for this longing, I have it not.  Bethink thee what a little\r\nwhile it is since the lack of another man\xe2\x80\x99s love grieved me sorely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The time is short,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98if we tell up the hours thereof;\r\nbut in that short space have a many things betid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Dost thou know, canst thou guess, how sorely ashamed I went\r\namongst my people?  I durst look no man in the face for the aching of\r\nmine heart, which methought all might see through my face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew it well,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98yet of me wert thou not ashamed but a little\r\nwhile ago, when thou didst tell me of thy grief.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98True it is; and thou wert kind to me.  Thou didst become a\r\ndear friend to me, methought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And wilt thou hurt a dear friend?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98if I might do otherwise.  Yet how if I might not\r\nchoose?  Shall there be no forgiveness for me then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe answered nothing; and still he held her hand that strove not to be\r\ngone from his, and she cast down her eyes.  Then he spake in a while:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My friend, I have been thinking of thee and of me; and now hearken: if\r\nthou wilt declare that thou feelest no sweetness embracing thine heart\r\nwhen I say that I desire thee sorely, as now I say it; or when I kiss\r\nthine hand, as now I kiss it; or when I pray thee to suffer me to cast\r\nmine arms about thee and kiss thy face, as now I pray it: if thou wilt\r\nsay this, then will I take thee by the hand straightway, and lead thee to\r\nthe tents of the House of the Steer, and say farewell to thee till the\r\nbattle is over.  Canst thou say this out of the truth of thine heart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98What then if I cannot say this word?  What then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut he answered nothing; and she sat still a little while, and then arose\r\nand stood before him, looking him in the eyes, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot say it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he caught her in his arms and strained her to him, and then kissed\r\nher lips and her face again and again, and she strove not with him.  But\r\nat last she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet after all this shalt thou lead me back to my folk straight-way; and\r\nwhen the battle is done, if both we are living, then shall we speak more\r\nthereof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he took her hand and led her on toward the tents of the Steer, and for\r\na while he spake nought; for he doubted himself, what he should say; but\r\nat last he spake:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now is this better for me than if it had not been, whether I live or\r\nwhether I die.  Yet thou hast not said that thou lovest me and desirest\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wilt thou compel me?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98To-night I may not say it.  Who shall\r\nsay what words my lips shall fashion when we stand together victorious in\r\nSilver-dale; then indeed may the time seem long from now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, true is that; yet once again I say that so measured long\r\nand long is the time since first I saw thee in Burgdale before thou\r\nknewest me.  Yet now I will not bicker with thee, for be sure that I am\r\nglad at heart.  And lo you! our feet have brought us to the tents of thy\r\npeople.  All good go with thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And with thee, sweet friend,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  Then she lingered a little,\r\nturning her head toward the tents, and then turned her face toward him\r\nand laid her hand on his neck, and drew his head adown to her and kissed\r\nhis cheek, and therewith swiftly and lightly departed from him.\r\n\r\nNow the night wore and the morning came; and Face-of-god was abroad very\r\nearly in the morning, as his custom was; and he washed the night from off\r\nhim in the Carles\xe2\x80\x99 Bath of the Shivering Flood, and then went round\r\nthrough the encampment of the host, and saw none stirring save here and\r\nthere the last watchmen of the night.  He spake with one or two of these,\r\nand then went up to the head of the Vale, where was the pass that led to\r\nSilver-dale; and there he saw the watch, and spake with them, and they\r\ntold him that none had as yet come forth from the pass, and he bade them\r\nto blow the horn of warning to rouse up the Host as soon as the\r\nmessengers came thence.  For forerunners had been sent up the pass, and\r\nhad been set to hold watch at divers places therein to pass on the word\r\nfrom place to place.\r\n\r\nThence went Face-of-god back toward the Hall; but when he was yet some\r\nway from it, he saw a slender glittering warrior come forth from the door\r\nthereof, who stood for a moment looking round about, and then came\r\nlightly and swiftly toward him; and lo! it was the Sun-beam, with a long\r\nhauberk over her kirtle falling below her knees, a helm on her head and\r\nplated shoes on her feet.  She came up to him, and laid her hand to his\r\ncheek and the golden locks of his head (for he was bare-headed), and said\r\nto him, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane! thou badest me bear arms, and Folk-might also constrained me\r\nthereto.  Lo thou!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Folk-might is wise then, even as I am; and forsooth as\r\nthou art.  For bethink thee if the bow drawn at a venture should speed\r\nthe eyeless shaft against thy breast, and send me forth a wanderer from\r\nmy Folk!  For how could I bear the sight of the fair Dale, and no hope to\r\nsee thee again therein?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98The heart is light within me to-day.  Deemest thou that this\r\nis strange?  Or dost thou call to mind that which thou spakest the other\r\nday, that it was of no avail to stand in the Doom-ring of the Folk and\r\nbear witness against ourselves?  This will I not.  This is no\r\nlight-mindedness that thou beholdest in me, but the valiancy that the\r\nFathers have set in mine heart.  Deem not, O Gold-mane, fear not, that we\r\nshall die before they dight the bride-bed for us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe would have kissed her mouth, but she put him away with her hand, and\r\ndoffed her helm and laid it on the grass, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is not the last time that thou shalt kiss me, Gold-mane, my dear;\r\nand yet I long for it as if it were, so high as the Fathers have raised\r\nme up this morn above fear and sadness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said nought, but drew her to him, and wonder so moved him, that he\r\nlooked long and closely at her face before he kissed her; and forsooth he\r\ncould find no blemish in it: it was as if it were but new come from the\r\nsmithy of the Gods, and exceeding longing took hold of him.  But even as\r\ntheir lips met, from the head of the Vale came the voice of the great\r\nhorn; and it was answered straightway by the watchers all down the tents;\r\nand presently arose the shouts of men and the clash of weapons as folk\r\narmed themselves, and laughter therewith, for most men were battle-merry,\r\nand the cries of women shrilly-clear as they hastened about, busy over\r\nthe morning meal before the departure of the Host.  But Face-of-god said\r\nsoftly, still caressing the Sun-beam, and she him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thus then we depart from this Valley of the Shadows, but as thou saidst\r\nwhen first we met therein, there shall be no sundering of thee and me,\r\nbut thou shalt go down with me to the battle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he led her by the hand into the Hall of the Wolf, and there they ate\r\na morsel, and thereafter Face-of-god tarried not, but busied himself\r\nalong with Folk-might and the other chieftains in arraying the Host for\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.  THE HOST DEPARTETH FROM SHADOWY VALE: THE FIRST DAY\xe2\x80\x99S\r\nJOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was about three hours before noon that the Host began to enter into\r\nthe pass out of Shadowy Vale by the river-side; and the women and\r\nchildren, and men unfightworthy, stood on the higher ground at the foot\r\nof the cliffs to see the Host wend on the way.  Of these a many were of\r\nthe Woodlanders, who were now one folk with them of Shadowy Vale.  And\r\nall these had chosen to abide tidings in the Vale, deeming that there was\r\nlittle danger therein, since that last slaughter which Folk-might had\r\nmade of the Dusky Men; albeit Face-of-god had offered to send them all to\r\nBurgstead with two score and ten men-at-arms to guard them by the way and\r\nto eke out the warders of the Burg.\r\n\r\nNow the fighting-men of Shadowy Vale were two long hundreds lacking five;\r\nof whom two score and ten were women, and three score and ten lads under\r\ntwenty winters; but the women, though you might scarce see fairer of face\r\nand body, were doughty in arms, all good shooters in the bow; and the\r\nswains were eager and light-foot, cragsmen of the best, wont to scaling\r\nthe cliffs of the Vale in search of the nests of gerfalcons and such-like\r\nfowl, and swimming the strong streams of the Shivering Flood; tough\r\nbodies and wiry, stronger than most grown men, and as fearless as the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nThe order of the Departure of the Host was this:\r\n\r\nThe Woodlanders went first into the pass, and with them were two score of\r\nthe ripe Warriors of the Wolf.  Then came of the kindreds of Burgdale,\r\nthe Men of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull; then the Men of the Vine\r\nand the Sickle; then the Shepherd-folk; and lastly, the Men of the Face\r\nled by Stone-face and Hall-face.  With these went another two score of\r\nthe dwellers in Shadowy Vale, and the rest were scattered up and down the\r\nbands of the Host to guide them into the best paths and to make the way\r\neasier to them.  Face-of-god was sundered from his kindred, and went\r\nalong with Folk-might in the forefront of the Host, while his father the\r\nAlderman went as a simple man-at-arms with his House in the rearward.\r\nThe Sun-beam followed her brother and Face-of-god amidst the Warriors of\r\nthe Wolf, and with her were Bow-may clad in the Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s gift, and\r\nWood-father and his children.  Bow-may had caused her to doff her hauberk\r\nfor that day, whereon they looked to fall in with no foeman.  As for the\r\nBride, she went with her kindred in all her war-gear; and the morning sun\r\nshone in the gems of her apparel, and her jewelled feet fell like flowers\r\nupon the deep grass of the upper Vale, and shone strange and bright\r\namongst the black stones of the pass.  She bore a quiver at her back and\r\na shining yew bow in her hand, and went amongst the bowmen, for she was a\r\nvery deft archer.\r\n\r\nSo fared they into the pass, leaving peace behind them, with all their\r\nbanners displayed, and the banner of the Red-mouthed Wolf went with the\r\nWolf and the Sun-burst in the forefront of their battle next after the\r\ntwo captains.\r\n\r\nAs for their road, the grassy space between the rock-wall and the water\r\nwas wide and smooth at first, and the cliffs rose up like bundles of\r\nspear-shafts high and clear from the green grass with no confused litter\r\nof fallen stones; so that the men strode on briskly, their hearts\r\nhigh-raised and full of hope.  And as they went, the sweetness of song\r\nstirred in their souls, and at last Bow-may fell to singing in a loud\r\nclear voice, and her cousin Wood-wise answered her, and all the warriors\r\nof the Wolf who were in their band fell into the song at the ending, and\r\nthe sound of their melody went down the water and reached the ears of\r\nthose that were entering the pass, and of those who were abiding till the\r\nway should be clear of them: and this is some of what they sang:\r\n\r\n                            _Bow-may singeth_:\r\n\r\n   Hear ye never a voice come crying\r\n      Out from the waste where the winds fare wide?\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98Sons of the Wolf, the days are dying,\r\n      And where in the clefts of the rocks do ye hide?\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98Into your hands hath the Sword been given,\r\n      Hard are the palms with the kiss of the hilt;\r\n   Through the trackless waste hath the road been riven\r\n      For the blade to seek to the heart of the guilt.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98And yet ye bide and yet ye tarry;\r\n      Dear deem ye the sleep \xe2\x80\x99twixt hearth and board,\r\n   And sweet the maiden mouths ye marry,\r\n      And bright the blade of the bloodless sword.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                           _Wood-wise singeth_:\r\n\r\n   Yea, here we dwell in the arms of our Mother\r\n      The Shadowy Queen, and the hope of the Waste;\r\n   Here first we came, when never another\r\n      Adown the rocky stair made haste.\r\n\r\n   Far is the foe, and no sword beholdeth\r\n      What deed we work and whither we wend;\r\n   Dear are the days, and the Year enfoldeth\r\n      The love of our life from end to end.\r\n\r\n   Voice of our Fathers, why will ye move us,\r\n      And call up the sun our swords to behold?\r\n   Why will ye cry on the foeman to prove us?\r\n      Why will ye stir up the heart of the bold?\r\n\r\n                            _Bow-may singeth_:\r\n\r\n   Purblind am I, the voice of the chiding;\r\n      Then tell me what is the thing ye bear?\r\n   What is the gift that your hands are hiding,\r\n      The gold-adorned, the dread and dear?\r\n\r\n                           _Wood-wise singeth_:\r\n\r\n   Dark in the sheath lies the Anvil\xe2\x80\x99s Brother,\r\n      Hid is the hammered Death of Men.\r\n   Would ye look on the gift of the green-clad Mother?\r\n      How then shall ye ask for a gift again?\r\n\r\n                           _The Warriors sing_:\r\n\r\n   Show we the Sunlight the Gift of the Mother,\r\n      As foot follows foot to the foeman\xe2\x80\x99s den!\r\n   Gleam Sun, breathe Wind, on the Anvil\xe2\x80\x99s Brother,\r\n      For bare is the hammered Death of Men.\r\n\r\nTherewith they shook their naked swords in the air, and fared on eagerly,\r\nand as swiftly as the pass would have them fare.  But so it was, that\r\nwhen the rearward of the Host was entering the first of the pass, and was\r\ngoing on the wide smooth sward, the vanward was gotten to where there was\r\nbut a narrow space clear betwixt water and cliff; for otherwhere was a\r\nlitter of great rocks and small, hard to be threaded even by those who\r\nknew the passes well; so that men had to tread along the very verge of\r\nthe Shivering Flood, and wary must they be, for the water ran swift and\r\ndeep betwixt banks of sheer rock half a fathom below their very\r\nfoot-soles, which had but bare space to go on the narrow a way.  So it\r\nheld on for a while, and then got safer, and there was more space for\r\ngoing betwixt cliff and flood; albeit it was toilsome enough, since for\r\nsome way yet there was a drift of stones to cumber their feet, some big\r\nand some little, and some very big.  After a while the way grew better,\r\nthough here and there, where the cliffs lowered, were wide screes of\r\nloose stones that they must needs climb up and down.  Thereafter for a\r\nspace was there an end of the stony cumber, but the way betwixt the river\r\nand the cliffs narrowed again, and the black crags grew higher, and at\r\nlast so exceeding high, and the way so narrow, that the sky overhead was\r\nto them as though they were at the bottom of a well, and men deemed that\r\nthence they could see the stars at noontide.  For some time withal had\r\nthe way been mounting up and up, though the cliffs grew higher over it;\r\ntill at last they were but going on a narrow shelf, the Shivering Flood\r\nswirling and rattling far below them betwixt sheer rock-walls grown\r\nexceeding high; and above them the cliffs going up towards the heavens as\r\nblack as a moonless starless night of winter.  And as the flood thundered\r\nbelow, so above them roared the ceaseless thunder of the wind of the\r\npass, that blew exceeding fierce down that strait place; so that the\r\nskirts of their garments were wrapped about their knees by it, and their\r\nfeet were well-nigh stayed at whiles as they breasted the push thereof.\r\n\r\nBut as they mounted higher and higher yet, the noise of the waters\r\nswelled into a huge roar that drowned the bellowing of the prisoned wind,\r\nand down the pass came drifting a fine rain that fell not from the sky,\r\nfor between the clouds of that drift could folk see the heavens bright\r\nand blue above them.  This rain was but the spray of the great force up\r\nto whose steps they were climbing.\r\n\r\nNow the way got rougher as they mounted; but this toil was caused by\r\ntheir gain; for the rock-wall, which thrust out a buttress there as if it\r\nwould have gone to the very edge of the gap where-through the flood ran,\r\nand so have cut the way off utterly, was here somewhat broken down, and\r\nits stones scattered down the steep bent, so that there was a passage,\r\nthough a toilsome one.\r\n\r\nThus then through the wind-borne drift of the great force, through which\r\nmen could see the white waters tossing down below, amidst the clattering\r\nthunder of the Shivering Flood and the rumble of the wind of the gap,\r\nthat tore through their garments and hair as if it would rend all to rags\r\nand bear it away, the banners of the Wolf won their way to the crest of\r\nthe midmost height of the pass, and the long line of the Host came\r\nclambering after them; and each band of warriors as it reached the top\r\ncast an unheard shout from amidst the tangled fury of wind and waters.\r\n\r\nA little further on and all that turmoil was behind them; the sun, now\r\ngrown low, smote the wavering column of spray from the force at their\r\nbacks, till the rainbows lay bright across it; and the sunshine lay wide\r\nover a little valley that sloped somewhat steeply to the west right up\r\nfrom the edge of the river; and beyond these western slopes could men see\r\na low peak spreading down on all sides to the plain, till it was like to\r\na bossed shield, and the name of it was Shield-broad.  Dark grey was the\r\nvalley everywhere, save that by the side of the water was a space of\r\nbright green-sward hedged about toward the mountain by a wall of rocks\r\ntossed up into wild shapes of spires and jagged points.  The river itself\r\nwas spread out wide and shallow, and went rattling about great grey rocks\r\nscattered here and there amidst it, till it gathered itself together to\r\ntumble headlong over three slant steps into the mighty gap below.\r\n\r\nFrom the height in the pass those grey slopes seemed easy to traverse;\r\nbut the warriors of the Wolf knew that it was far otherwise, for they\r\nwere but the molten rock-sea that in time long past had flowed forth from\r\nShield-broad and filled up the whole valley endlong and overthwart,\r\ncooling as it flowed, and the tumbled hedge of rock round about the green\r\nplain by the river was where the said rock-sea had been stayed by meeting\r\nwith soft ground, and had heaped itself up round about the green-sward.\r\nAnd that great rock-flood as it cooled split in divers fashions; and the\r\nrain and weather had been busy on it for ages, so that it was worn into a\r\nmaze of narrow paths, most of which, after a little, brought the wayfarer\r\nto a dead stop, or else led him back again to the place whence he had\r\nstarted; so that only those who knew the passes throughly could thread\r\nthat maze without immeasurable labour.\r\n\r\nNow when the men of the Host looked from the high place whereon they\r\nstood toward the green plain by the river, they saw on the top of that\r\nrock-wall a red pennon waving on a spear, and beside it three or four\r\nweaponed men gleaming bright in the evening sun; and they waved their\r\nswords to the Host, and made lightning of the sunbeams, and the men of\r\nthe Host waved swords to them in turn.  For these were the outguards of\r\nthe Host; and the place whereon they were was at whiles dwelt in by those\r\nwho would drive the spoil in Silver-dale, and midmost of the green-sward\r\nwas a booth builded of rough stones and turf, a refuge for a score of men\r\nin rough weather.\r\n\r\nSo the men of the vanward gat them down the hill, and made the best of\r\ntheir way toward the grassy plain through that rocky maze which had once\r\nbeen as a lake of molten glass; and as short as the way looked from\r\nabove, it was two hours or ever they came out of it on to the smooth\r\nturf, and it was moonlight and night ere the House of the Face had gotten\r\non to the green-sward.\r\n\r\nThere then the Host abode for that night, and after they had eaten lay\r\ndown on the green grass and slept as they might.  Bow-may would have\r\nbrought the Sun-beam into the booth with some others of the women, but\r\nshe would not enter it, because she deemed that otherwise the Bride would\r\nabide without; and the Bride, when she came up, along with the House of\r\nthe Steer, beheld the Sun-beam, that Wood-father\xe2\x80\x99s children had made a\r\nlair for her without like a hare\xe2\x80\x99s form; and forsooth many a time had she\r\nlain under the naked heaven in Shadowy Vale and the waste about it, even\r\nas the Bride had in the meadows of Burgdale.  So when the Bride was\r\nbidden thereto, she went meekly into the booth, and lay there with others\r\nof the damsels-at-arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.  THE HOST COMETH TO THE EDGES OF SILVER-DALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSO wore the night, and when the dawn was come were the two captains\r\nafoot, and they went from band to band to see that all was ready, and all\r\nmen were astir betimes, and by the time that the sun smote the eastern\r\nside of Shield-broad ruddy, they had broken their fast and were dight for\r\ndeparture.  Then the horns blew up beside the banners, and rejoiced the\r\nhearts of men.  But by the command of the captains this was the last time\r\nthat they should sound till they blew for onset in Silver-dale, because\r\nnow would they be drawing nigher and nigher to the foemen, and they\r\nwotted not but that wandering bands of them might be hard on the lips of\r\nthe pass, and might hear the horns\xe2\x80\x99 voice, and turn to see what was\r\ntoward.\r\n\r\nForth then went the banners of the Wolf, and the men of the vanward fell\r\nto threading the rock-maze toward the north, and in two hours\xe2\x80\x99 time were\r\nclear of the Dale under Shield-broad.  All went in the same order as\r\nyesterday; but on this day the Sun-beam would bear her hauberk, and had a\r\nsword girt to her side, and her heart was high and her speech merry.\r\n\r\nWhen they left the Dale under Shield-broad the way was easy and wide for\r\na good way, the river flowing betwixt low banks, and the pass being more\r\nlike a string of little valleys than a mere gap, as it had been on the\r\nother side of the Dale.  But when one third of the day was past, the way\r\nbegan to narrow on them again, and to rise up little by little; and at\r\nlast the rock-walls drew close to the river, and when men looked toward\r\nthe north they saw no way, and nought but a wall.  For the gap of the\r\nShivering Flood turned now to the east, and the Flood came down from the\r\neast in many falls, as it were over a fearful stair, through a gap where\r\nthere was no path between the cliffs and the water, nought but the\r\nboiling flood and its turmoil; so that they who knew not the road\r\nwondered what they should do.\r\n\r\nBut Folk-might led the banners to where a great buttress of the cliffs\r\nthrust itself into the way, coming well-nigh down to the water, just at\r\nthe corner where the river turned eastward, and they got them about it as\r\nthey might, and on the other side thereof lo! another gap exceeding\r\nstrait, scarce twenty foot over, wall-sided, rugged beyond measure, going\r\nup steeply from the great valley: a little water ran through it, mostly\r\nfilling up the floor of it from side to side; but it was but shallow.\r\nThis was now the battle-road of the Host, and the vanward entered it at\r\nonce, turning their backs upon the Shivering Flood.\r\n\r\nFull toilsome and dreary was that strait way; often great stones hung\r\nabove their heads, bridging the gap and hiding the sky from them; nor was\r\nthere any path for them save the stream itself; so that whiles were they\r\nwading its waters to the knee or higher, and whiles were they striding\r\nfrom stone to stone amidst the rattle of the waters, and whiles were they\r\nstepping warily along the ledges of rock above the deeper pools, and in\r\nall wise labouring in overcoming the rugged road amidst the twilight of\r\nthe gap.\r\n\r\nThus they toiled till the afternoon was well worn, and so at last they\r\ncame to where the rock-wall was somewhat broken down on the north side,\r\nand great rocks had fallen across the gap, and dammed up the waters,\r\nwhich fell scantily over the dam from stone to stone into a pool at the\r\nbottom of it.  Up this breach, then, below the force they scrambled and\r\nstruggled, for rough indeed was the road for them; and so came they up\r\nout of the gap on to the open hill-side, a great shoulder of the heath\r\nsloping down from the north, and littered over with big stones, borne\r\nthither belike by some ice-river of the earlier days; and one great rock\r\nwas in special as great as the hall of a wealthy goodman, and shapen like\r\nto a hall with hipped gables, which same the men of the Wolf called\r\nHouse-stone.\r\n\r\nThere then the noise and clatter of the vanward rose up on the face of\r\nthe heath, and men were exceeding joyous that they had come so far\r\nwithout mishap.  Therewith came weaponed men out from under House-stone,\r\nand they came toward the men of the vanward, and they were a half-score\r\nof the forerunners of the Wolf; therefore Folk-might and Face-of-god fell\r\nat once into speech with them, and had their tidings; and when they had\r\nheard them, they saw nought to hinder the host from going on their road\r\nto Silver-dale forthright; and there were still three hours of daylight\r\nbefore them.  So the vanward of the host tarried not, and the captains\r\nleft word with the men from under House-stone that the rest of the Host\r\nshould fare on after them speedily, and that they should give this word\r\nto each company, as men came up from out the gap.  Then they fared\r\nspeedily up the hillside, and in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s wearing had come to the crest\r\nthereof, and to where the ground fell steadily toward the north, and\r\nhereabout the scattered stones ceased, and on the other side of the crest\r\nthe heath began to be soft and boggy, and at last so soft, that if they\r\nhad not been wisely led, they had been bemired oftentimes.  At last they\r\ncame to where the flows that trickled through the mires drew together\r\ninto a stream, so that men could see it running; and thereon some of the\r\nWoodlanders cried out joyously that the waters were running north; and\r\nthen all knew that they were drawing nigh to Silver-dale.\r\n\r\nNo man they met on the road, nor did they of Shadowy Vale look to meet\r\nany; because the Dusky Men were not great hunters for the more part,\r\nexcept it were of men, and especially of women; and, moreover, these\r\nhill-slopes of the mountain-necks led no-whither and were utterly waste\r\nand dreary, and there was nought to be seen there but snipes and bitterns\r\nand whimbrel and plover, and here and there a hill-fox, or the great erne\r\nhanging over the heath on his way to the mountain.\r\n\r\nWhen sunset came, they were getting clear of the miry ground, and the\r\nstream which they had come across amidst of the mires had got clearer and\r\ngreater, and rattled down between wide stony sides over the heath; and\r\nhere and there it deepened as it cleft its way through little knolls that\r\nrose out of the face of the mountain-neck.  As the Host climbed one of\r\nthese and was come to its topmost (it was low enough not to turn the\r\nstream), Face-of-god looked and beheld dark-blue mountains rising up far\r\noff before him, and higher than these, but away to the east, the snowy\r\npeaks of the World-mountains.  Then he called to mind what he had seen\r\nfrom the Burg of the Runaways, and he took Folk-might by the arm, and\r\npointed toward those far-off mountains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98so it is, War-leader.  Silver-dale lieth between\r\nus and yonder blue ridges, and it is far nigher to us than to them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the Sun-beam came close to those twain, and took Face-of-god by the\r\nhand and said: \xe2\x80\x98O Gold-mane, dost thou see?\xe2\x80\x99 and he turned about and\r\nbeheld her, and saw how her cheeks flamed and her eyes glittered, and he\r\nsaid in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x98To-morrow for mirth or silence, for life or death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the whole vanward as they came up stayed to behold the sight of the\r\nmountains on the other side of Silver-dale, and the banners of the Folk\r\nhung over their heads, moving but little in the soft air of the evening:\r\nso went they on their ways.\r\n\r\nThe sun sank, and dusk came on them as they followed down the stream, and\r\nnight came, and was clear and starlit, though the moon was not yet risen.\r\nNow was the ground firm and the grass sweet and flowery, and wind-worn\r\nbushes were scattered round about them, as they began to go down into the\r\nghyll that cleft the wall of Silver-dale, and the night-wind blew in\r\ntheir faces from the very Dale and place of the Battle to be.  The path\r\ndown was steep at first, but the ghyll was wide, and the sides of it no\r\nlonger straight walls, as in the gaps of their earlier journey, but\r\nbroken, sloping back, and (as they might see on the morrow) partly of big\r\nstones and shaly grit, partly grown over with bushes and rough grass,\r\nwith here and there a little stream trickling down their sides.  As they\r\nwent, the ghyll widened out, till at last they were in a valley going\r\ndown to the plain, in places steep, in places flat and smooth, the stream\r\never rattling down the midst of it, and they on the west side thereof.\r\nThe vale was well grassed, and oak-trees and ash and holly and hazel grew\r\nhere and there about it; and at last the Host had before it a wood which\r\nfilled the vale from side to side, not much tangled with undergrowth, and\r\nquite clear of it nigh to the stream-side.  Thereinto the vanward\r\nentered, but went no long way ere the leaders called a halt and bade\r\npitch the banners, for that there should they abide the daylight.  Thus\r\nit had been determined at the Council of the Hall of the Wolf; for\r\nFolk-might had said: \xe2\x80\x98With an Host as great as ours, and mostly of men\r\ncome into a land of which they know nought at all, an onslaught by night\r\nis perilous: yea, and our foes should be over-much scattered, and we\r\nshould have to wander about seeking them.  Let us rather abide in the\r\nwood of Wood-dale till the morning, and then display our banners on the\r\nhill-side above Silver-dale, so that they may gather together to fall\r\nupon us: in no case shall they keep us out of the Dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere then they stayed, and as each company came up to the wood, they\r\nwere marshalled into their due places, so that they might set the battle\r\nin array on the edge of Silver-dale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.  FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON SILVER-DALE: THE BOWMEN\xe2\x80\x99S BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE then they rested, as folk wearied with the toilsome journey, when\r\nthey had set sure watches round about their campment; and they ate\r\nquietly what meat they had with them, and so gat them to sleep in the\r\nwood on the eve of battle.\r\n\r\nBut not all slept; for the two captains went about amongst the companies,\r\nFolk-might to the east, Face-of-god to the west, to look to the watches,\r\nand to see that all was ordered duly.  Also the Sun-beam slept not, but\r\nshe lay beside Bow-may at the foot of an oak-tree; she watched\r\nFace-of-god as he went away amidst the men of the Host, and watched and\r\nwaked abiding his returning footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe night was well worn by then he came back to his place in the vanward,\r\nand on his way back he passed through the folk of the Steer laid along on\r\nthe grass, all save those of the watch, and the light of the moon high\r\naloft was mingled with the light of the earliest dawn; and as it happed\r\nhe looked down, and lo! close to his feet the face of the Bride as she\r\nlay beside her grand-sire, her head pillowed on a bundle of bracken.  She\r\nwas sleeping soundly like a child who has been playing all day, and whose\r\nsleep has come to him unsought and happily.  Her hands were laid together\r\nby her side; her cheek was as fair and clear as it was wont to be at her\r\nbest; her face looked calm and happy, and a lock of her dark-red hair\r\nstrayed from her uncovered head over her breast and lay across her\r\nwrists, so peacefully she slept.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god turned his eyes from her at once, and went by swiftly, and\r\ncame to his own company.  The Sun-beam saw him coming, and rose\r\nstraightway to her feet from beside Bow-may, who lay fast asleep, and she\r\nheld out her hands to him; and he took them and kissed them, and he cast\r\nhis arms about her and kissed her mouth and her face, and she his in\r\nlikewise; and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Gold-mane, if this were but the morrow of to-morrow!  Yet shall all be\r\nwell; shall it not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer voice was low, but it waked Bow-may, who sat up at once broad awake,\r\nafter the manner of a hunter of the waste ever ready for the next thing\r\nto betide, and moreover the Sun-beam had been in her thoughts these two\r\ndays, and she feared for her, lest she should be slain or maimed.  Now\r\nshe smiled on the Sun-beam and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?  Does thy mind forebode evil?  That needeth not.  I tell\r\nthee it is not so ill for us of the sword to be in Silver-dale.  Thrice\r\nhave I been there since the Overthrow, and never more than a half-score\r\nin company, and yet am I whole to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, sister,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98but in past times ye did your deed and\r\nthen fled away; but now we come to abide here, and this night is the last\r\nof lurking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98a little way from this I saw such things that we had\r\ngood will to abide here longer, few as we were, but that we feared to be\r\ntaken alive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What things were these?\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I will not tell thee now; but mayhap in the lighted\r\nwinter feast-hall, when the kindred are so nigh us and about us that they\r\nseem to us as if they were all the world, I may tell it thee; or mayhap I\r\nnever shall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the Sun-beam, smiling: \xe2\x80\x98Thou wilt ever be talking, Bow-may.  Now let\r\nthe War-leader depart, for he will have much to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she was well at ease that she had seen Face-of-god again; but he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, not so much; all is well-nigh done; in an hour it will be broad\r\nday, and two hours thereafter shall the Banner be displayed on the edge\r\nof Silver-dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cheek of the Sun-beam flushed, and paled again, as she said: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, we\r\nshall stand even as our Fathers stood on the day when, coming from off\r\nthe waste, they beheld it, and knew it would be theirs.  Ah me! how have\r\nI longed for this morn.  But now\xe2\x80\x94Tell me, Gold-mane, dost thou deem that\r\nI am afraid?  And I whom thou hast deemed to be a God.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nQuoth Bow-may: \xe2\x80\x98Thou shalt deem her twice a God ere noon-tide, brother\r\nGold-mane.  But come now! the hour of deadly battle is at hand, and we\r\nmay not laugh that away; and therefore I bid thee remember, Gold-mane,\r\nhow thou didst promise to kiss me once more on the verge of deadly\r\nbattle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she stood up before him, and he tarried not, but kind and\r\nsmiling took her face between his two hands and kissed her lips, and she\r\ncast her arms about him and kissed him, and then sank down on the grass\r\nagain, and turned from him, and laid her face amongst the grass and the\r\nbracken, and they could see that she was weeping, and her body was shaken\r\nwith sobs.  But the Sun-beam knelt down to her, and caressed her with her\r\nhand, and spake kind words to her softly, while Face-of-god went his ways\r\nto meet Folk-might.\r\n\r\nNow was the dawn fading into full daylight; and between dawn and sunrise\r\nwere all men stirring; for the watch had waked the hundred-leaders, and\r\nthey the leaders of scores and half-scores, and they the whole folk; and\r\nthey sat quietly in the wood and made no noise.\r\n\r\nIn the night the watch of the Sickle had fallen in with a thrall who had\r\nstolen up from the Dale to set gins for hares, and now in the early\r\nmorning they brought him to the War-leader.  He was even such a man as\r\nthose with whom Face-of-god had fallen in before, neither better nor\r\nworse than most of them: he was sore afraid at first, but by then he was\r\ncome to the captains he understood that he had happened upon friends; but\r\nhe was dull of comprehension and slow of speech.  Albeit Folk-might\r\ngathered from him that the Dusky Men had some inkling of the onslaught;\r\nfor he said that they had been gathering together in the marketplace of\r\nSilver-stead, and would do so again soon.  Moreover, the captains deemed\r\nfrom his speech that those new tribes had come to hand sooner than was\r\nlooked for, and were even now in the Dale.  Folk-might smiled as one who\r\nis not best pleased when he heard these tidings; but Face-of-god was glad\r\nto hear thereof; for what he loathed most was that the war should drag\r\nout in hunting of scattered bands of the foe.  Herewith came Dallach to\r\nthem as they talked (for Face-of-god had sent for him), and he fell to\r\nquestioning the man further; by whose answers it seemed that many men\r\nalso had come into the Dale from Rose-dale, so that they of the kindreds\r\nwere like to have their hands full.  Lastly Dallach drew from the thrall\r\nthat it was on that very morning that the great Folk-mote of the Dusky\r\nMen should be holden in the market-place of the Stead, which was right\r\ngreat, and about it were the biggest of the houses wherein the men of the\r\nkindred had once dwelt.\r\n\r\nSo when they had made an end of questioning the thrall, and had given him\r\nmeat and drink, they asked him if he would take weapons in his hand and\r\nlead them on the ways into the Dale, bidding him look about the wood and\r\nnote how great and mighty an host they were.  And the carle yeasaid this,\r\nafter staring about him a while, and they gave him spear and shield, and\r\nhe went with the vanward as a way-leader.\r\n\r\nAgain presently came a watch of the Shepherds, and they had found a man\r\nand a woman dead and stark naked hanging to the boughs of a great\r\noak-tree deep in the wood.  This men knew for some vengeance of the Dusky\r\nMen, for it was clear to see that these poor people had been sorely\r\ntormented before they were slain.  Also the same watch had stumbled on\r\nthe dead body of an old woman, clad in rags, lying amongst the rank grass\r\nabout a little flow; she was exceeding lean and hunger-starved, and in\r\nher hand was a frog which she had half eaten.  And Dallach, when he heard\r\nof this, said that it was the wont of the Dusky Men to slay their thralls\r\nwhen they were past work, or to drive them into the wilderness to die.\r\n\r\nLastly came a watch from the men of the Face, having with them two more\r\nthralls, lusty young men; these they had come upon in company of their\r\nmaster, who had brought them up into the wood to shoot him a buck, and\r\ntherefore they bare bows and arrows.  The watch had slain the master\r\nstraightway while the thralls stood looking on.  They were much afraid of\r\nthe weaponed men, but answered to the questioning much readier than the\r\nfirst man; for they were household thralls, and better fed and clad than\r\nhe, who was but a toiler in the fields.  They yeasaid all his tale, and\r\nsaid moreover that the Folk-mote of the Dusky Men should be holden in the\r\nmarket-place that forenoon, and that most of the warriors should be\r\nthere, both the new-comers and the Rose-dale lords, and that without\r\ndoubt they should be under arms.\r\n\r\nTo these men also they gave a good sword and a helm each, and bade them\r\nbe brisk with their bows, and they said yea to marching with the Host;\r\nand indeed they feared nothing so much as being left behind; for if they\r\nfell into the hands of the Dusky Men, and their master missing, they\r\nshould first be questioned with torments, and then slain in the evillest\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nNow whereas things had thus betid, and that they knew thus much of their\r\nfoemen, Face-of-god called all the chieftains together, and they sat on\r\nthe green grass and held counsel amongst them, and to one and all it\r\nseemed good that they should suffer the Dusky Men to gather together\r\nbefore they meddled with them, and then fall upon them in such order and\r\nsuch time as should seem good to the captains watching how things went;\r\nand this would be easy, whereas they were all lying in the wood in the\r\nsame order as they would stand in battle-array if they were all drawn up\r\ntogether on the brow of the hill.  Albeit Face-of-god deemed it good,\r\nafter he had heard all that they who had been in the Stead could tell him\r\nthereof, that the Shepherd-Folk, who were more than three long hundreds,\r\nand they of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, four hundreds in all,\r\nshould take their places eastward of the Woodlanders who had led the\r\nvanward.\r\n\r\nStraightway the word was borne to these men, and the shift was made: so\r\nthat presently the Woodlanders were amidmost of the Host, and had with\r\nthem on their right hands the Men of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull,\r\nand beyond them the Shepherd-Folk.  But on their left hand lay the Men of\r\nthe Vine, then they of the Sickle, and lastly the Men of the Face, and\r\nthese three kindreds were over five hundreds of warriors: as for the Men\r\nof the Wolf, they abode at first with those companies which they had led\r\nthrough the wastes, though this was changed afterwards.\r\n\r\nAll this being done, Face-of-god gave out that all men should break their\r\nfast in peace and leisure; and while men were at their meat, Folk-might\r\nspake to Face-of-god and said: \xe2\x80\x98Come, brother, for I would show thee a\r\ngoodly thing; and thou, Dallach, come with us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he brought them by paths in the wood till Face-of-god saw the sky\r\nshine white between the tree-boles, and in a little while they were come\r\nwell-nigh out of the thicket, and then they went warily; for before them\r\nwas nought but the slopes of Wood-dale, going down steeply into\r\nSilver-dale, with nought to hinder the sight of it, save here and there\r\nbushes or scattered trees; and so fair and lovely it was that Face-of-god\r\ncould scarce forbear to cry out.  He saw that it was only at the upper or\r\neastern end, where the mountains of the Waste went round about it, that\r\nthe Dale was narrow; it soon widened out toward the west, and for the\r\nmost part was encompassed by no such straight-sided a wall as was\r\nBurgdale, but by sloping hills and bents, mostly indeed somewhat higher\r\nand steeper than the pass wherein they were, but such as men could well\r\nclimb if they had a mind to, and there were any end to their journey.\r\nThe Dale went due west a good way, and then winded about to the\r\nsouthwest, and so was hidden from them thereaway by the bents that lay on\r\ntheir left hand.  As it was wider, so it was not so plain a ground as was\r\nBurgdale, but rose in knolls and little hills here and there.  A river\r\ngreater than the Weltering Water wound about amongst the said mounds; and\r\nalong the side of it out in the open dale were many goodly houses and\r\nhomesteads of stone.  The knolls were mostly covered over with vines, and\r\nthere were goodly and great trees in groves and clumps, chiefly oak and\r\nsweet chestnut and linden; many were the orchards, now in blossom, about\r\nthe homesteads; the pastures of the neat and horses spread out bright\r\ngreen up from the water-side, and deeper green showed the acres of the\r\nwheat on the lower slopes of the knolls, and in wide fields away from the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nJust below the pitch of the hill whereon they were, lay Silver-stead, the\r\ntown of the Dale.  Hitherto it had been an unfenced place; but Folk-might\r\npointed to where on the western side a new white wall was rising, and on\r\nwhich, young as the day yet was, men were busy laying the stones and\r\nspreading the mortar.  Fair seemed that town to Face-of-god: the houses\r\nwere all builded of stone, and some of the biggest were roofed with lead,\r\nwhich also as well as silver was dug out of the mountains at the eastern\r\nend of the Dale.  The market-place was clear to see from where they\r\nstood, though there were houses on all sides of it, so wide it was.  From\r\ntheir standing-place it was but three furlongs to this heart of\r\nSilver-dale; and Face-of-god could see brightly-clad men moving about in\r\nit already.  High above their heads he beheld two great clots of scarlet\r\nand yellow raised on poles and pitched in front of a great stone-built\r\nhall roofed with lead, which stood amidmost of the west end of the Place,\r\nand betwixt those poles he saw on a mound with long slopes at its sides\r\nsomewhat of white stone, and amidmost of the whole Place a great stack of\r\nfaggot-wood built up four-square.  Those red and yellow things on the\r\npoles he deemed would be the banners of the murder-carles; and Folk-might\r\ntold him that even so it was, and that they were but big bunches of\r\nstrips of woollen cloth, much like to great ragmops, save that the rags\r\nwere larger and longer: no other token of war, said Folk-might, did those\r\nfolk carry, save a crookbladed sword, smeared with man\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and\r\nbigger than any man might wield in battle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Art thou far-seeing, War-leader?\xe2\x80\x99 quoth he.  \xe2\x80\x98What canst thou see in the\r\nmarket-place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Far-seeing am I above most men, and I see in the Place\r\na man in scarlet standing by the banner, which is pitched in front of the\r\ngreat stone hall, near to the mound with the white stone on it; and\r\nmeseemeth he beareth a great horn in his hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, and that stone hall was our Mote-house when we\r\nwere lords of the Dale, and thence it was that they who are now thralls\r\nof the Dusky Men sent to them their message and token of yielding.  And\r\nas for that white stone, it is the altar of their god; for they have but\r\none, and he is that same crook-bladed sword.  And now that I look, I see\r\na great stack of wood amidmost the market-place, and well I know what\r\nthat betokeneth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lo you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98the man with the horn is gone up on to the\r\naltar-mound, and meseemeth he is setting the little end of the horn to\r\nhis mouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hearken then!\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might.  And in a moment came the hoarse\r\ntuneless sound of the horn down the wind towards them; and Folk-might\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I deem I should know what that blast meaneth; and now is it time that\r\nthe Host drew nigher to set them in array behind these very trees.  But\r\nif ye will, War-leader, we will abide here and watch the ways of the\r\nfoemen, and send Dallach with the word to the Host; also I would have\r\nthee suffer me to bid hither at once two score and ten of the best of the\r\nbowmen of our folk and the Woodlanders, and Wood-wise to lead them, for\r\nhe knoweth well the land hereabout, and what is good to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.  \xe2\x80\x98Be speedy, Dallach!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Dallach departed, running lightly, and the two chiefs abode there; and\r\nthe horn in Silver-stead blew at whiles for a little, and then stayed;\r\nand Folk-might said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lo you! they come flockmeal to the Mote-stead; the Place will be filled\r\nere long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Will they make offerings to their god at the hallowing\r\nin of their Folk-mote?  Where then are the slaughter-beasts?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They shall not long be lacking,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might.  \xe2\x80\x98See you it is\r\ngetting thronged about the altar and the Mote-house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow there were four ways into the Market-place of Silver-stead turned\r\ntoward the four a\xc3\xadrts, and the midmost of the kindreds\xe2\x80\x99 battle looked\r\nright down the southern one, which went up to the wood, but stopped there\r\nin a mere woodland path, and the more part of the town lay north and west\r\nof this way, albeit there was a way from the east also.  But the\r\nhill-side just below the two captains lay two furlongs west of this\r\nsouthern way; and it went down softly till it was gotten quite near to\r\nthe backs of the houses on the south side of the Market-place, and was\r\nsprinkled scantly with bushes and trees as aforesaid; but at last were\r\nthere more bushes, which well-nigh made a hedge across it, reaching from\r\nthe side of the southern way; and a foot or two beyond these bushes the\r\nground fell by a steep and broken bent down to the level of the\r\nMarket-place, and betwixt that fringe of bushes and the backs of the\r\nhouses on the south side of the Place was less it maybe than a full\r\nfurlong: but the southern road aforesaid went down softly into the\r\nMarket-place, since it had been fashioned so by men.\r\n\r\nNow the two chiefs heard a loud blast of horns come up from the town, and\r\nlo! a great crowd of men wending their ways down the road from the north,\r\nand they came into the market-place with spears and other weapons tossing\r\nin the air, and amidst of these men, who seemed to be all of the\r\nwarriors, they saw as they drew nigher some two score and ten of men clad\r\nin long raiment of yellow and scarlet, with tall spiring hats of strange\r\nfashion on their heads, and in their hands long staves with great blades\r\nlike scythes done on to them; and again, in the midst of these yellow and\r\nred glaive-bearers, in the very heart of the throng were some score of\r\nnaked folk, they deemed both men and women, but were not sure, so close\r\nwas the throng; nor could they see if they were utterly naked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lo you, brother!\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98said I not that the beasts for the\r\nhewing should not tarry?  Yonder naked folk are even they: and ye may\r\nwell deem that they are the thralls of the Dusky Men; and meseemeth by\r\nthe whiteness of their skins they be of the best of them.  For these\r\nfelons, it is like, look to winning great plenty of thralls in Burgdale,\r\nand so set the less store on them they have, and may expend them freely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spake they heard the sound of men marching in the wood behind them,\r\nand they turned about and saw that there was come Wood-wise, and with him\r\nupwards of two score and ten of the bowmen of the Woodlanders and the\r\nWolf\xe2\x80\x94huntsmen, cragsmen, and scourers of the Waste; men who could shoot\r\nthe chaffinch on the twig a hundred yards aloof; who could make a\r\nhiding-place of the bennets of the wayside grass, or the stem of the\r\nslender birch-tree.  With these must needs be Bow-may, who was the\r\nclosest shooter of all the kindreds.\r\n\r\nSo then Wood-wise told the War-leader that Dallach had given the word to\r\nthe Host, and that all men were astir and would be there presently in\r\ntheir ordered companies; and Face-of-god spake to Folk-might, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chief of the Wolf, wilt thou not give command to these bowmen, and set\r\nthem to the work; for thou wottest thereof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, that will I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, and turned to Wood-wise, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wood-wise, get ye down the slope, and loose on these felons, who have a\r\nmurder on hand, if so be ye have a chance to do it wisely.  But in any\r\ncase come ye all back; for all shall be needed yet to-day.  So flee if\r\nthey pursue, for ye shall have us to flee to.  Now be ye wary, nor let\r\nthe curse of the Wolf and the Face lie on your slothfulness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWood-wise did but nod his head and lift his hand to his fellows, who set\r\noff after him down the slope without more tarrying.  They went very\r\nwarily, as if they were hunting a quarry which would flee from them; and\r\nthey crept amongst the grass and stones from bush to bush like serpents,\r\nand so, unseen by the Dusky Men, who indeed were busied over their own\r\nmatters, they came to the fringe of bushes above the broken ground\r\naforesaid, and there they took their stand, and before them below those\r\nsteep banks was but the space at the back of the houses.  As to the\r\nhouses, as aforesaid, they were not so high as elsewhere about the\r\nMarket-place; and at the end of a long low hall there was a gap between\r\nits gable and the next house, whereby they had a clear sight of the Place\r\nabout the god\xe2\x80\x99s altar and the banners, and the great hall of Silver-dale,\r\nwith the double stair that went up to the door thereof.\r\n\r\nThere then they made them ready, and Wood-wise set men to watch that none\r\nshould come sidelong on them unawares; their bows were bent and their\r\nquivers open, and they were eager for the fray.\r\n\r\nThus they beheld the Market-place from their cover, and saw that those\r\nfolk who were to be hewn to the god were now standing facing the altar in\r\na half-ring, and behind them in another half-ring the glaive-bearers who\r\nhad brought them thither stood glaive in hand ready to hew them down when\r\nthe token should be given; and these were indeed the priests of the god.\r\n\r\nThere was clear space round about these poor slaughter-thralls, so that\r\nthe bowmen could see them well, and they told up a score of them, half\r\nmen, half women, and they were all stark naked save for wreaths of\r\nflowers about their middles and their necks; and they had shackles of\r\nlead about their wrists; which same lead should be taken out of the fire\r\nwherein they should be burned, and from the shape it should take after it\r\nhad passed through the fire would the priests foretell the luck of the\r\ndeed to be done.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to be seen from thence that Folk-might was right when he\r\nsaid that these slaughter-thralls were of the best of the house-thralls\r\nand bed-mates of the Dusky Men, and that these felons were open-handed to\r\ntheir god, and would not cheat him, or withhold from him the best and\r\nmost delicate of all they had.\r\n\r\nNow spake Wood-wise to those about him: \xe2\x80\x98It is sure that Folk-might would\r\nhave us give these poor thralls a chance, and that we must loose upon the\r\nfelons who would hew them down; and if we are to come back again, we can\r\ngo no nigher.  What sayest thou, Bow-may?  Is it nigh enough?  Can aught\r\nbe done?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98nigh enough it is; but let Gold-ring be with me\r\nand half a score of the very best, whether they be of our folk or the\r\nWoodlanders, men who cannot miss such a mark; and when we have loosed,\r\nthen let all loose, and stay not till our shot be spent.  Haste, now\r\nhaste! time presseth; for if the Host showeth on the brow of the hill,\r\nthese felons will hew down their slaughter-beasts before they turn on\r\ntheir foemen.  Let the grey-goose wing speed trouble and confusion\r\namongst them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut ere she had done her words Wood-wise had got to speaking quietly with\r\nthe Woodlanders; and Bears-bane, who was amidst them, chose out eight of\r\nthe best of his folk, men who doubted nothing of hitting whatever they\r\ncould see in the Market-place; and they took their stand for shooting,\r\nand with them besides Bow-may were two women and four men of the Wolf,\r\nand Gold-ring withal, a carle of fifty winters, long, lean, and wiry, a\r\nfell shooter if ever anyone were.\r\n\r\nSo all these notched their shafts and laid them on the yew, and each had\r\nbetween the two last fingers of the shaft-hand another shaft ready, and a\r\nhalf score more stuck into the ground before him.\r\n\r\nNow giveth Wood-wise the word to these sixteen as to which of the felons\r\nwith the glaives they shall each one aim at; and he saith withal in a\r\nsoft voice: \xe2\x80\x98Help cometh from the Hill; soon shall battle be joined in\r\nSilver-dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus stand they watching Bow-may and Gold-ring till they draw home the\r\nnotches; and amidst their waiting the glaive-bearing felons fall\r\na-singing a harsh and ugly hymn to their crooked-sword god, and the\r\nMarket-stead is thronged endlong and overthwart with the tribes of the\r\nDusky Men.\r\n\r\nThere now standeth Bow-may far-sighted and keen-eyed, her face as pale as\r\na linen sleeve, an awful smile on her glittering eyes and close-set lips,\r\nand she feeling the twisted string of the red yew and the polished sides\r\nof the notch, while the yelling song of the Dusky priests quavers now and\r\nends with a wild shrill cry, and she noteth the midmost of the priests\r\nbeginning to handle his weapon: then swift and steady she draweth home\r\nthe notches, while the yew bow standeth still as the oak-bole ere the\r\nsummer storm ariseth, and the twang of the sixteen strings maketh but one\r\nfell sound as the feathered bane of men goeth on its way.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment of time in the Market of Silver-stead, as\r\nif the bolt of the Gods had fallen there; and then arose a huge wordless\r\nyell from those about the altar, and one of the priests who was left hove\r\nup his glaive two-handed to smite the naked slaughter-thralls; but or\r\never the stroke fell, Bow-may\xe2\x80\x99s second shaft was through his throat, and\r\nhe rolled over amidst his dead fellows; and the other fifteen had loosed\r\nwith her, and then even as they could Wood-wise and the others of their\r\ncompany; and all they notched and loosed without tarrying, and no shout,\r\nno word came from their lips, only the twanging strings spake for them;\r\nfor they deemed the minutes that hurried by were worth much joy of their\r\nlives to be.  And few indeed were the passing minutes ere the dead men\r\nlay in heaps about the Altar of the Crooked Sword, and the wounded men\r\nwallowed amidst them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.  OF THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE MEN OF THE STEER, THE BRIDGE, AND\r\nTHE BULL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD was the turmoil and confusion in the Market-stead; for the more part\r\nof the men therein knew not what had befallen about the altar, though\r\nsome clomb up to the top of that stack of faggots built for the burning\r\nof the thralls, and when they saw what was toward fell to yelling and\r\ncursing; and their fellows on the plain Place could not hear their story\r\nfor the clamour, and they also fell to howling as if a wood full of wild\r\ndogs was there.\r\n\r\nAnd still the shafts rained down on that throng from the Bent of the\r\nBowmen, for another two score men of the Woodlanders had crept down the\r\nhill to them, and shafts failed them not.  But the Dusky Men about the\r\naltar, for all their terror, or even maybe because of it, now began to\r\nturn upon the scarce-seen foemen, and to press up wildly toward the\r\nhill-side, though as it were without any order or aim.  Every man of them\r\nhad his weapons, and those no mere gilded toys, but their very tools of\r\nbattle; and some, but no great number, had their bows with them and a few\r\nshafts; and these began to shoot at whatsoever they could see on the\r\nhill-side, but at first so wildly and hurriedly that they did no harm.\r\n\r\nIt must be said of them that at first only those about the altar fell on\r\ntoward the hill; for those about the road that led southward knew not\r\nwhat had betided nor whither to turn.  So that at this beginning of the\r\nbattle, of all the thousands in the great Place it was but a few hundreds\r\nthat set on the Bent of the Bowmen, and at these the bowmen of the\r\nkindreds shot so close and so wholly together that they fell one over\r\nanother in the narrow ways between the houses whereby they must needs go\r\nto gather on the plain ground betwixt the backs of the houses and the\r\nbreak of the hill-side.  But little by little the archers of the Dusky\r\nMen gathered behind the corpses of the slain, and fell to shooting at\r\nwhat they could see of the men of the kindreds, which at that while was\r\nnot much, for as bold as they were, they fought like wary hunters of the\r\nWood and the Waste.\r\n\r\nBut now at last throughout all that throng of Felons in the Market-place\r\nthe tale began to spread of foemen come into the Dale and shooting from\r\nthe Bents, and all they turned their faces to the hill, and the whole set\r\nof the throng was thitherward; though they fared but slowly, so evil was\r\nthe order of them, each man hindering his neighbour as he went.  And not\r\nonly did the Dusky Men come flockmeal toward the Bent of the Bowmen, but\r\nalso they jostled along toward the road that led southward.  That beheld\r\nWood-wise from the Bent, and he was minded to get him and his aback, now\r\nthat they had made so great a slaughter of the foemen; and two or three\r\nof his fellows had been hurt by arrows, and Bow-may, she would have been\r\nslain thrice over but for the hammer-work of the Alderman.  And no marvel\r\nwas that; for now she stood on a little mound not half covered by a thin\r\nthorn-bush, and notched and loosed at whatever was most notable, as\r\nthough she were shooting at the mark on a summer evening in Shadowy Vale.\r\nBut as Wood-wise was at point to give the word to depart, from behind\r\nthem rang out the merry sound of the Burgdale horns, and he turned to\r\nlook at the wood-side, and lo! thereunder was the hill bright and dark\r\nwith men-at-arms, and over them floated the Banners of the Wolf, and the\r\nBanners of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull.  Then gave forth the\r\nbowmen of the kindreds their first shout, and they made no stay in their\r\nshooting; but shot the eagerer, for they deemed that help would come\r\nwithout their turning about to draw it to them: and even so it was.  For\r\nstraightway down the bent came striding Face-of-god betwixt the two\r\nBanners of the Wolf, and beside him were Red-wolf the tall and War-grove,\r\nand therewithal Wood-wont and Wood-wicked, and many other men of the\r\nWolf; for now that the men of the kindreds had been brought face to face\r\nwith the foe, and there was less need of them for way-leaders, the more\r\npart of them were liefer to fight under their own banner along with the\r\nWoodlanders; so that the company of those who went under the Wolves was\r\nmore than three long hundreds and a half; and the bowmen on the edge of\r\nthe bent shouted again and merrily, when they felt that their brothers\r\nwere amongst them, and presently was the arrow-storm at its fiercest, and\r\nthe twanging of bow-strings and the whistle of the shafts was as the wind\r\namong the clefts of the mountains; for all the new-comers were bowmen of\r\nthe best.\r\n\r\nBut the kindreds of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, they hung yet a\r\nwhile longer on the hills\xe2\x80\x99 brow, their banners floating over them and\r\ntheir horns blowing; and the Dusky Felons in the Market-place beheld\r\nthem, and fear and rage at once filled their hearts, and a fierce and\r\ndreadful yell brake out from them, and joyously did the Men of Burgdale\r\nanswer them, and song arose amongst them even such as this:\r\n\r\n                      _The Men of the Bridge sing_:\r\n\r\n   Why stand ye together, why bear ye the shield,\r\n   Now the calf straineth tether at edge of the field?\r\n\r\n   Now the lamb bleateth stronger and waters run clear,\r\n   And the day groweth longer and glad is the year?\r\n\r\n   Now the mead-flowers jostle so thick as they stand,\r\n   And singeth the throstle all over the land?\r\n\r\n                       _The Men of the Steer sing_:\r\n\r\n   No cloud the day darkened, no thunder we heard,\r\n   But the horns\xe2\x80\x99 speech we hearkened as men unafeared.\r\n\r\n   Yea, so merry it sounded, we turned from the Dale,\r\n   Where all wealth abounded, to wot of its tale.\r\n\r\n                      _The Men of the Bridge sing_:\r\n\r\n   What white boles then bear ye, what wealth of the woods?\r\n   What chafferers hear ye bid loud for your goods?\r\n\r\n                       _The Men of the Bull sing_:\r\n\r\n   O the bright beams we carry are stems of the steel;\r\n   Nor long shall we tarry across them to deal.\r\n\r\n   Hark the men of the cheaping, how loudly they cry\r\n   On the hook for the reaping of men doomed to die!\r\n\r\n                             _They all sing_:\r\n\r\n   Heave spear up! fare forward, O Men of the Dale!\r\n   For the Warrior, our war-ward, shall hearken the tale.\r\n\r\nTherewith they ceased a moment, and then gave a great and hearty shout\r\nall together, and all their horns blew, and they moved on down the hill\r\nas one man, slowly and with no jostling, the spear-men first, and then\r\nthey of the axe and the sword; and on their flanks the deft archers\r\nloosed on the stumbling jostling throng of the Dusky Men, who for their\r\npart came on drifting and surging up the road to the hill.\r\n\r\nBut when those big spearmen of the Dale had gone a little way the horns\xe2\x80\x99\r\nvoice died out, and their great-staved spears rose up from their\r\nshoulders into the air, and stood so a moment, and then slowly fell\r\nforward, as the oars of the longship fall into the row-locks, and then\r\nover the shoulders of the foremost men showed the steel of the five ranks\r\nbehind them, and their own spears cast long bars of shadow on the\r\nwhiteness of the sunny road.  No sound came from them now save the rattle\r\nof their armour and the tramp of their steady feet; but from the Dusky\r\nMen rose up hideous confused yelling, and those that could free\r\nthemselves from the tangle of the throng rushed desperately against the\r\non-rolling hedge of steel, and the whole throng shoved on behind them.\r\nThen met steel and men; here and there an ash-stave broke; here and there\r\na Dusky Felon rolled himself unhurt under the ash-staves, and hewed the\r\nknees of the Dalesmen, and a tall man came tottering down; but what men\r\nor wood-wights could endure the push of spears of those mighty\r\nhusbandmen?  The Dusky Ones shrunk back yelling, or turned their backs\r\nand rushed at their own folk with such fierce agony that they entered\r\ninto the throng, till the terror of the spear reached to the midmost of\r\nit and swayed them back on the hindermost; for neither was there outgate\r\nfor the felons on the flanks of the spearmen, since there the feathered\r\ndeath beset them, and the bowmen (and the Bride amongst the foremost)\r\nshot wholly together, and no shaft flew idly.  But the wise leaders of\r\nthe Dalesmen would not that they should thrust in too far amongst the\r\nhowling throng of the Dusky Men, lest they should be hemmed in by them;\r\nfor they were but a handful in regard to them: so there they stayed,\r\nbarring the way to the Dusky Men, and the bowmen still loosed from the\r\nflanks of them, or aimed deftly from betwixt the ranks of the spearmen.\r\n\r\nAnd now was there a space of ten strides or more betwixt the Dalesmen and\r\ntheir foes, over which the spears hung terribly, nor durst the Dusky Men\r\nadventure there; and thereon was nought but men dead or sorely hurt.\r\nThen suddenly a horn rang thrice shrilly over all the noise and clamour\r\nof the throng, and the ranks of the spearmen opened, and forth into that\r\nspace strode two score of the swordsmen and axe-wielders of the Dale,\r\ntheir weapons raised in their hands, and he who led them was Iron-hand of\r\nthe House of the Bull: tall he was, wide-shouldered, exceeding strong,\r\nbut beardless and fair-faced.  He bore aloft a two-edged sword,\r\nbroad-bladed, exceeding heavy, so that few men could wield it in battle,\r\nbut not right long; it was an ancient weapon, and his father before him\r\nhad called it the Barley-scythe.  With him were some of the best of the\r\nkindreds, as Wolf of Whitegarth, Long-hand of Oakholt, Hart of Highcliff,\r\nand War-well the captain of the Bridge.  These made no tarrying on that\r\nspace of the dead, but cried aloud their cries: \xe2\x80\x98For the Burg and the\r\nSteer! for the Dale and the Bridge! for the Dale and the Bull!\xe2\x80\x99 and so\r\nfell at once on the Felons; who fled not, nor had room to flee; and also\r\nthey feared not the edge-weapons so sorely as they feared those huge\r\nspears.  So they turned fiercely on the swordsmen, and chiefly on\r\nIron-hand, as he entered in amongst them the first of all, hewing to the\r\nright hand and the left, and many a man fell before the Barley-scythe;\r\nfor they were but little before him.  Yet as one fell another took his\r\nplace, and hewed at him with the steel axe and the crooked sword; and\r\nwith many strokes they clave his shield and brake his helm and rent his\r\nbyrny, while he heeded little save smiting with the Barley-scythe, and\r\nthe blood ran from his arm and his shoulder and his thigh.\r\n\r\nBut War-well had entered in among the foe on his left hand, and\r\nunshielded hove up a great broad-bladed axe, that clave the iron helms of\r\nthe Dusky Men, and rent their horn-scaled byrnies.  He was not very tall,\r\nbut his shoulders were huge and his arms long, and nought could abide his\r\nstroke.  He cleared a ring round Iron-hand, whose eyes were growing dim\r\nas the blood flowed from him, and hewed three strokes before him; then\r\nturned and drew the champion out of the throng, and gave him into the\r\narms of his fellows to stanch the blood that drained away the might of\r\nhis limbs; and then with a great wordless roar leaped back again on the\r\nDusky Men as the lion leapeth on the herd of swine; and they shrank away\r\nbefore him; and all the swordsmen shouted, \xe2\x80\x98For the Bridge, for the\r\nBridge!\xe2\x80\x99 and pressed on the harder, smiting down all before them.  On his\r\nleft hand now was Hart of Highcliff wielding a good sword hight\r\nChip-driver, wherewith he had slain and hurt a many, fighting wisely with\r\nsword and shield, and driving the point home through the joints of the\r\narmour.  But even therewith, as he drave a great stroke at a lord of the\r\nDusky Ones, a cast-spear came flying and smote him on the breast, so that\r\nhe staggered, and the stroke fell flatlings on the shield-boss of his\r\nfoe, and Chip-driver brake atwain nigh the hilts; but Hart closed with\r\nhim, and smote him on the face with the pommel, and tore his axe from his\r\nhand and clave his skull therewith, and slew him with his own weapon, and\r\nfought on valiantly beside War-well.\r\n\r\nNow War-well had fought so fiercely that he had rent his own hauberk with\r\nthe might of his strokes, and as he raised his arm to smite a huge\r\nstroke, a deft man of the Felons thrust the spike of his war-axe up under\r\nhis arm; and when War-well felt the smart of the steel, he turned on that\r\nman, and, letting his axe fall down to his wrist and hang there by its\r\nloop, he caught the foeman up by the neck and the breech, and drave him\r\nagainst the other Dusky Ones before him, so that their weapons pierced\r\nand rent their own friend and fellow.  Then he put forth the might of his\r\narms and the pith of his body, and hove up that felon and cast him on to\r\nthe heads of his fellow murder-carles, so that he rent them and was rent\r\nby them.  Then War-well fell on again with the axe, and all the champions\r\nof the Dale shouted and fell on with him, and the foe shrank away; and\r\nthe Dalesmen cleared a space five fathoms\xe2\x80\x99 length before them, and the\r\nspearmen drew onward and stood on the space whereon the first onslaught\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nThen drew those hewers of the Dale together, and forth from the company\r\ncame the man that bare the Banner of the Bridget and the champions\r\ngathered round him, and they ordered their ranks and strode with the\r\nBanner before them three times to and fro across the road athwart the\r\nfront of the spearmen, and then with a great shout drew back within the\r\nspear-hedge.  Albeit five of the champions of the Dale had been slain\r\noutright there, and the more part of them hurt more or less.\r\n\r\nBut when all were well within the ranks, once again blew the horn, and\r\nall the spears sank to the rest, and the kindreds drave the spear-furrow,\r\nand a space was swept clear before them, and the cries and yells of the\r\nDusky Men were so fierce and wild that the rough voices of the Dalesmen\r\nwere drowned amidst them.\r\n\r\nForth then came every bowman of the kindred that was there and loosed on\r\nthe Dusky Men; and they forsooth had some bowmen amongst them, but cooped\r\nup and jostled as they were they shot but wildly; whereas each shaft of\r\nthe Dale went home truly.\r\n\r\nBut amongst the bowmen forth came the Bride in her glittering war-gear,\r\nand stepped lightly to the front of the spearmen.  Her own yew bow had\r\nbeen smitten by a shaft and broken in her hand: so she had caught up a\r\nshort horn bow and a quiver from one of the slain of the Dusky Men; and\r\nnow she knelt on one knee under the shadow of the spears nigh to her\r\ngrandsire Hall-ward, and with a pale face and knitted brow notched and\r\nloosed, and notched and loosed on the throng of foemen, as if she were\r\nsome daintily fashioned engine of war.\r\n\r\nSo fared the battle on the road that went from the south into the\r\nMarket-stead.  Valiantly had the kindred fought there, and no man of them\r\nhad blenched, and much had they won; but the way was perilous before\r\nthem, for the foe was many and many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.  OF FACE-OF-GOD\xe2\x80\x99S ONSLAUGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW the banners of the Wolf flapped and rippled over the heads of the\r\nWoodlanders and the Men of the Wolf; and the men shot all they might, nor\r\ntook heed now to cover themselves against the shafts of the Dusky Men.\r\nAs for these, for all they were so many, their arrow-shot was no great\r\nmatter, for they were in very evil order, as has been said; and moreover,\r\ntheir rage was so great to come to handy strokes with these foemen, that\r\nsome of them flung away their bows to brandish the axe or the sword.\r\nNevertheless were some among the kindred hurt or slain by their arrows.\r\n\r\nNow stood Face-of-god with the foremost; and from where he stood he could\r\nsee somewhat of the battle of the Dalesmen, and he wotted that it was\r\nthriving; therefore he looked before him and close around him, and noted\r\nwhat was toward there.  The space betwixt the houses and the break of the\r\nbent was crowded with the fury of the Dusky Men tossing their weapons\r\naloft, crying to each other and at the kindred, and here and there\r\nloosing a bow-string on them; but whatever was their rage they might not\r\ncome a many together past a line within ten fathom of the bent\xe2\x80\x99s end; for\r\nthree hundred of the best of bowmen were shooting at them so ceaselessly\r\nthat no Dusky man was safe of any bare place of his body, and they fell\r\nover one another in that penfold of slaughter, and for all their madness\r\ndid but little.\r\n\r\nYet was the heart of the War-leader troubled; for he wotted that it might\r\nnot last for ever, and there seemed no end to the throng of\r\nmurder-carles; and the time would come when the arrowshot would be spent,\r\nand they must needs come to handy strokes, and that with so many.\r\n\r\nNow a voice spake to him as he gazed with knitted brows and careful heart\r\non that turmoil of battle:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What now hast thou done with the Sun-beam, and where is her brother?  Is\r\nthe Chief of the Wolf skulking when our work is so heavy?  And thou\r\nmeseemeth art overlate on the field: the mowing of this meadow is no\r\nsluggard\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned and beheld Bow-may, and gazed on her face for a moment, and saw\r\nher eyes how they glittered, and how the pommels of her cheeks were\r\nburning red and her lips dry and grey; but before he answered he looked\r\nall round about to see what was to note; and he touched Bow-may on the\r\nshoulder and pointed to down below where a man of the Felons had just\r\ncome out of the court of one of the houses: a man taller than most, very\r\ngaily arrayed, with gilded scales all over him, so that, with his dark\r\nface and blue eyes, he looked like some strange dragon.  Bow-may spake\r\nnot, but stamped her foot with anger.  Yet if her heart were hot, her\r\nhand was steady; for she notched a shaft, and just as the Dusky Chief\r\nraised his axe and brandished it aloft, she loosed, and the shaft flew\r\nand smote the felon in the armpit and the default of the armour, and he\r\nfell to earth.  But even as she loosed, Face-of-god cried out in a loud\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O lads of battle! shoot close and all together.  Tarry not, tarry not!\r\nfor we need a little time ere sword meets sword, and the others of the\r\nkindreds are at work!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Bow-may turned round to him and said: \xe2\x80\x98Wilt thou not answer me?\r\nWhere is thy kindness gone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven as she was speaking she had notched and loosed another shaft,\r\nspeaking as folk do who turn from busy work at loom or bench.\r\n\r\nThen said Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Shoot on, sister Bow-may!  The Sun-beam is gone\r\nwith her brother, and he is with the Men of the Face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe broke off here, for a man fell beside him hurt in the neck, and\r\nFace-of-god took his bow from his hands and shot a shaft, while one of\r\nthe women who had been hurt also tended the newly-wounded man.  Then\r\nFace-of-god went on speaking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was unwilling to go, but Folk-might and I constrained her; for we\r\nknew that this is the most perilous place of the battle\xe2\x80\x94hah! see those\r\nthree felons, Bow-may! they are aiming hither.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd again he loosed and Bow-may also, but a shaft rattled on his helm\r\nwithal and another smote a Woodlander beside him, and pierced through the\r\ncalf of his leg, as he turned and stooped to take fresh arrows from a\r\nsheaf that lay there; but the carle took it by the notch and the point,\r\nand brake it and drew it out, and then stood up and went on shooting.\r\nAnd Face-of-god spake again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Folk-might skulketh not; nor the Men of the Vine, and the Sickle, and\r\nthe Face, nor the Shepherd-Folk: soon shall they be making our work easy\r\nto us, if we can hold our own till then.  They are on the other roads\r\nthat lead into the square.  Now suffer me, and shoot on!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he looked round about him, and he saw on the left hand that all\r\nwas quiet; and before him was the confused throng of the Dusky Men\r\ntrampling their own dead and wounded, and not able as yet to cross that\r\ndeath-line of the arrow so near to them.  But on his right hand he saw\r\nhow they of the kindreds held them firm on the way.  Then for a moment of\r\ntime he considered and thought, till him-seemed he could see the whole\r\nbattle yet to be foughten; and his face flushed, and he said sharply:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bow-may, abide here and shoot, and show the others where to shoot, while\r\nthe arrows hold out; but we will go further for a while, and ye shall\r\nfollow when we have made the rent great enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe turned to him and said: \xe2\x80\x98Why art thou not more joyous? thou art like\r\nan host without music or banners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98heed not me, but my bidding!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said hastily: \xe2\x80\x98I think I shall die here; since for all we have shot\r\nwe minish them nowise.  Now kiss me this once amidst the battle, and say\r\nfarewell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, nay; it shall not go thus.  Abide a little while, and thou\r\nshalt see all this tangle open, as the sun cleaveth the clouds on the\r\nautumn morning.  Yet lo thou! since thou wilt have it so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he bent forward and kissed her face, and now the tears ran over it,\r\nand she said smiling somewhat: \xe2\x80\x98Now is this more than I looked for,\r\nwhatso may betide.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut while she was yet speaking he cried in a great voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye who have spent your shot, or have nigh spent it, to axe and sword,\r\nand follow me to clear the ground \xe2\x80\x99twixt the bent and the halls.  Let\r\neach help each, but throng not each other.  Shoot wisely, ye bowmen, and\r\nkeep our backs clear of the foe.  On, on! for the Burg and the Face, for\r\nthe Burg and the Face!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he leapt down the steep of the hill, bounding like the hart,\r\nwith Dale-warden naked in his hand; and they that followed were two score\r\nand ten; and the arrows of their bowmen rained over their heads on the\r\nDusky Men, as they smote down the first of the foemen, and the others\r\nshrieked and shrank from them, or turned on them smiting wildly and\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god swept round the great sword and plunged into that sea of\r\nturmoil and noise and evil sights and savours, and even therewith he\r\nheard clearly a voice that said: \xe2\x80\x98Goldring, I am hurt; take my bow a\r\nwhile!\xe2\x80\x99 and knew it for Bow-may\xe2\x80\x99s; but it came to his ears like the song\r\nof a bird without meaning; for it was as if his life were changed at\r\nonce; and in a minute or two he had cut thrice with the edge and thrust\r\ntwice with the point, eager, but clear-eyed and deft; and he saw as in a\r\npicture the foe before him, and the grey roofs of Silver-stead, and\r\nthrough the gap in them the tops of the blue ridges far aloof.  And now\r\nhad three fallen before him, and they feared him, and turned on him, and\r\nsmote so many together that their strokes crossed each other, and one\r\nwarded him from the other; and he laughed aloud and shielded himself, and\r\ndrave the point of Dale-warden amidst the tangle of weapons through the\r\nopen mouth of a captain of the Felons, and slashed a cheek with a\r\nback-stroke, and swept round the edge to his right hand and smote off a\r\nblue-eyed snub-nosed head; and therewith a pole-axe smote him on the left\r\nside of his helm, so that he tottered; but he swung himself round, and\r\nstood stark and upright, and gave a short hack with the edge, keeping\r\nDale-warden well in hand, and a gold-clad felon, a champion of them, and\r\ntheir tallest on the ground, fell aback, his throat gaping more than the\r\nmouth of him.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god shouted and waved Dale-warden aloft to the Banner of the\r\nWolf that floated behind and above him, and he cried out: \xe2\x80\x98As I have\r\npromised so have I done!\xe2\x80\x99  And he looked about, and beheld how valiantly\r\nhis fellows had been doing; for before him now was a space of earth with\r\nno man standing on his feet thereon, like the swathe of the mowers of\r\nJune; and beyond that was the crowd of the Dusky Men wavering like the\r\ntall grass abiding the scythe.\r\n\r\nBut a minute, and they fell to casting at Face-of-god and his fellows\r\nspears and knives and shields and whatsoever would fly; and a spear smote\r\nhim on the breast, but entered not; and a bossed shield fell over his\r\nface withal, and a plummet of sling-lead smote his helm, and he fell to\r\nearth; but leapt up again straightway, and heard as he arose a great\r\nshout close to him, and a shrill cry, and lo! at his left side Bow-may,\r\nher sword in her hand, and the hand red with blood from a shaft-graze on\r\nher wrist, and a white cloth stained with blood about her neck; and on\r\nhis right side Wood-wise bearing the banner and crying the Wolf-whoop;\r\nfor the whole company was come down from the slope and stood around him.\r\n\r\nThen for a little while was there such a stilling of the tumult about him\r\nthere, that he heard great and glad cries from the Road of the South of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Burg and the Steer!  The Dale and the Bridge!  The Dale and the\r\nBull!\xe2\x80\x99  And thereafter a terrible great shrieking cry, and a huge voice\r\nthat cried: \xe2\x80\x98Death, death, death to the Dusky Men!\xe2\x80\x99  And thereafter again\r\nfierce cries and great tumult of the battle.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god shook Dale-warden in the air, and strode forward\r\nfiercely, but not speedily, and the whole company went foot for foot\r\nalong with him; and as he went, would he or would he not, song came into\r\nhis mouth, a song of the meadows of the Dale, even such as this:\r\n\r\n   The wheat is done blooming and rust\xe2\x80\x99s on the sickle,\r\n      And green are the meadows grown after the scythe.\r\n   Come, hands for the dance!  For the toil hath been mickle,\r\n      And \xe2\x80\x99twixt haysel and harvest \xe2\x80\x99tis time to be blithe.\r\n\r\n   And what shall the tale be now dancing is over,\r\n      And kind on the meadow sits maiden by man,\r\n   And the old man bethinks him of days of the lover,\r\n      And the warrior remembers the field that he wan?\r\n\r\n   Shall we tell of the dear days wherein we are dwelling,\r\n      The best days of our Mother, the cherishing Dale,\r\n   When all round about us the summer is telling,\r\n      To ears that may hearken, the heart of the tale?\r\n\r\n   Shall we sing of these hands and these lips that caress us,\r\n      And the limbs that sun-dappled lie light here beside,\r\n   When still in the morning they rise but to bless us,\r\n      And oft in the midnight our footsteps abide?\r\n\r\n   O nay, but to tell of the fathers were better,\r\n      And of how we were fashioned from out of the earth;\r\n   Of how the once lowly spurned strong at the fetter;\r\n      Of the days of the deeds and beginning of mirth.\r\n\r\n   And then when the feast-tide is done in the morning,\r\n      Shall we whet the grey sickle that bideth the wheat,\r\n   Till wan grow the edges, and gleam forth a warning\r\n      Of the field and the fallow where edges shall meet.\r\n\r\n   And when cometh the harvest, and hook upon shoulder\r\n      We enter the red wheat from out of the road,\r\n   We shall sing, as we wend, of the bold and the bolder,\r\n      And the Burg of their building, the beauteous abode.\r\n\r\n   As smiteth the sickle amid the sun\xe2\x80\x99s burning\r\n      We shall sing how the sun saw the token unfurled,\r\n   When forth fared the Folk, with no thought of returning,\r\n      In the days when the Banner went wide in the world.\r\n\r\nMany saw that he was singing, but heard not the words of his mouth, for\r\ngreat was the noise and clamour.  But he heard Bow-may, how she laughed\r\nby his side, and cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, dear-heart, now art thou merry indeed; and glad am I, though\r\nthey told me that I am hurt.\xe2\x80\x94Ah! now beware, beware!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor indeed the Dusky Men, seeing the wall of steel rolling down on them,\r\nand cooped up by the houses, so that they scarce knew how to flee, turned\r\nin the face of death, the foremost of them, and rushed furiously on the\r\narray of the Woodlanders, and all those behind pressed on them like the\r\nbig wave of the ebbing sea when the gust of the wind driveth it landward.\r\n\r\nThe Woodlanders met them, shouting out: \xe2\x80\x98The Greenwood and the Wolf, the\r\nGreenwood and the Wolf!\xe2\x80\x99  But not a few of them fell there, though they\r\ngave not back a foot; for so fierce now were the Dusky Men, that hewing\r\nand thrusting at them availed nought, unless they were slain outright or\r\nstunned; and even if they fell they rolled themselves up against their\r\ntall foe-men, heeding not death or wounds if they might but slay or\r\nwound.  There then fell War-grove and ten others of the Woodlanders, and\r\nfour men of the Wolf, but none before he had slain his foeman; and as\r\neach man fell or was hurt grievously, another took his place.\r\n\r\nNow a felon leapt up and caught Gold-ring by the neck and drew him down,\r\nwhile another strove to smite his head off; but the stout carle drave a\r\nwood-knife into the side of the first felon, and drew it out speedily and\r\nsmote the other, the smiter, in the face with the same knife, and\r\ntherewith they all three rolled together on the earth amongst the feet of\r\nmen.  Even so did another felon by Bow-may, and dragged her down to the\r\nground, and smote her with a long knife as she tumbled down; and this was\r\na feat of theirs, for they were long-armed like apes.\r\n\r\nBut as to this felon, Dale-warden\xe2\x80\x99s edge split his skull, and Face-of-god\r\ngathered his might together and bestrode Bow-may, till he had hewed a\r\nspace round about him with great two-handed strokes; and yet the blade\r\nbrake not.  Then he caught up Bow-may from the earth, and the felon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknife had not pierced her hauberk, but she was astonied, and might not\r\nstand upon her feet; and Face-of-god turned aside a little with her, and\r\nhalf bore her, half thrust her through the throng to the rearward of his\r\nfolk, and left her there with two carlines of the Wolf who followed the\r\nhost for leechcraft\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and then turned back shouting: \xe2\x80\x98For the Face,\r\nfor the Face!\xe2\x80\x99 and there followed him back to the battle, a band of those\r\nwho were fresh as yet, and their blades unbloodied, the young men of the\r\nWoodlands.\r\n\r\nThe wearier fighters made way for them as they came on shouting, and\r\nFace-of-god was ahead of them all, and leapt at the foemen as a man\r\nunwearied and striking his first stroke, so wondrous hale he was; and\r\nthey drave a wedge amidst of the Dusky Men, and then turned about and\r\nstood back to back hewing at all that drifted on them.  But as\r\nFace-of-god cleared a space about him, lo! almost within reach of his\r\nsword-point up rose a grim shape from the earth, tall, grey-haired, and\r\nbloody-faced, who uttered the Wolf-whoop from amidst the terror of his\r\nvisage, and turned and swung round his head an axe of the Dusky Men, and\r\nfell to smiting them with their own weapon.  The Dusky Men shrieked in\r\nanswer to his whoop, and all shrunk from him and Face-of-god; but a cry\r\nof joy went up from the kindred, for they knew Gold-ring, whom they\r\ndeemed had been slain.  So they all pressed on together, smiting down the\r\nfoe before them, and the Dusky Men, some turned their backs and drave\r\nthose behind them, till they too turned and were strained through the\r\npassages and courts of the houses, and some were overthrown and trodden\r\ndown as they strove to hold face to the Woodlanders, and some were hewn\r\ndown where they stood; but the whole throng of those that were on their\r\nfeet drifted toward the Market-place, the Woodlanders following them ever\r\nwith point and edge, till betwixt the bent and the houses no foeman stood\r\nup against them.\r\n\r\nThen they stood together, and raised the whoop of victory, and blew their\r\nhorns long and loud in token of their joy, and the Woodland men lifted up\r\ntheir voices and sang:\r\n\r\n      Now far, far aloof\r\n      Standeth lintel and roof,\r\n      The dwelling of days\r\n      Of the Woodland ways:\r\n      Now nought wendeth there\r\n      Save the wolf and the bear,\r\n      And the fox of the waste\r\n      Faring soft without haste.\r\n   No carle the axe whetteth on oak-laden hill;\r\n   No shaft the hart letteth to wend at his will;\r\n   None heedeth the thunder-clap over the glade,\r\n   And the wind-storm thereunder makes no man afraid.\r\n   Is it thus then that endeth man\xe2\x80\x99s days on Mid-earth,\r\n   For no man there wendeth in sorrow or mirth?\r\n\r\n      Nay, look down on the road\r\n      From the ancient abode!\r\n      Betwixt acre and field\r\n      Shineth helm, shineth shield.\r\n      And high over the heath\r\n      Fares the bane in his sheath;\r\n      For the wise men and bold\r\n      Go their ways o\xe2\x80\x99er the wold.\r\n   Now the Warrior hath given them heart and fair day,\r\n   Unbidden, undriven, they fare to the fray.\r\n   By the rock and the river the banners they bear,\r\n   And their battle-staves quiver \xe2\x80\x99neath halbert and spear;\r\n   On the hill\xe2\x80\x99s brow they gather, and hang o\xe2\x80\x99er the Dale\r\n   As the clouds of the Father hang, laden with bale.\r\n\r\n      Down shineth the sun\r\n      On the war-deed half done;\r\n      All the fore-doomed to die,\r\n      In the pale dust they lie.\r\n      There they leapt, there they fell,\r\n      And their tale shall we tell;\r\n      But we, e\xe2\x80\x99en in the gate\r\n      Of the war-garth we wait,\r\n   Till the drift of war-weather shall whistle us on,\r\n   And we tread all together the way to be won,\r\n   To the dear land, the dwelling for whose sake we came\r\n   To do deeds for the telling of song-becrowned fame.\r\n   Settle helm on the head then!  Heave sword for the Dale!\r\n   Nor be mocked of the dead men for deedless and pale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.  MEN MEET IN THE MARKET OF SILVER-STEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSO sang they; but Face-of-god went with Red-wolf, who was hurt sorely,\r\nbut not deadly, and led him back toward the place just under the break of\r\nthe bent; and there he found Bow-may in the hands of the women who were\r\ntending her hurts.  She smiled on him from a pale face as he drew nigh,\r\nand he looked kindly at her, but he might not abide there, for haste was\r\nin his feet.  He left Red-wolf to the tending of the women, and clomb the\r\nbent hastily, and when he deemed he was high enough, he looked about him;\r\nand somewhat more than half an hour had worn since Bow-may had sped the\r\nfirst shaft against the Dusky Men.\r\n\r\nHe looked down into the Market-stead, and deemed he could see that nigh\r\nthe Mote-house the Dusky Men were gathering into some better order; but\r\nthey were no longer drifting toward the southern bents, but were standing\r\nround about the altar as men abiding somewhat; and he deemed that they\r\nhad gotten more bowshot than before, and that most of them bare bows.\r\nThough so many had been slain in the battles of the southern bents, yet\r\nwas the Market-stead full of them, so to say, for others had come thereto\r\nin place of those that had fallen.\r\n\r\nBut now as he looked arose mighty clamour amongst them; and a little west\r\nof the Altar was a stir and a hurrying onward and around as in the eddies\r\nof a swift stream.  Face-of-god wotted not what was betiding there, but\r\nhe deemed that they were now ware of the onfall of Folk-might and\r\nHall-face and the men of Burgdale, for their faces were all turned to\r\nwhere that was to be looked for.\r\n\r\nSo he turned and looked on the road to the east of him, where had been\r\nthe battle of the Steer, but now it was all gone down toward the\r\nMarket-place, and he could but hear the clamour of it; but nought he saw\r\nthereof, because of the houses that hid it.\r\n\r\nThen he cast his eyes on the road that entered the Market-stead from the\r\nnorth, and he saw thereon many men gathered; and he wotted not what they\r\nwere; for though there were weapons amongst them, yet were they not all\r\nweaponed, as far as he could see.\r\n\r\nNow as he looked this way and that, and deemed that he must tarry no\r\nlonger, but must enter into the courts of the houses before him and make\r\nhis way into the Market-stead, lo! a change in the throng of Dusky\r\nWarriors nigh the Mote-house, and the ordered bands about the Altar fell\r\nto drifting toward the western way with one accord, with great noise and\r\nhurry and fierce cries of wrath.  Then made Face-of-god no delay, but ran\r\ndown the bent at once, and at the break of it came upon Bow-may standing\r\nupright and sword in hand; and as he passed, she joined herself to him,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98What new tidings now, Gold-mane?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tidings of battle!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried; \xe2\x80\x98tidings of victory!  Folk-might hath\r\nfallen on, and the Dusky Men run hastily to meet him.  Hark, hark!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor as he spoke came a great noise of horns, and Bow-may said: \xe2\x80\x98What horn\r\nis that blowing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stayed not, but shouted aloud: \xe2\x80\x98For the Face, for the Face!  Now will\r\nwe fall upon their backs!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith was he come to his company, and he cried out to them: \xe2\x80\x98Heard ye\r\nthe horn, heard ye the horn?  Now follow me into the Market-place; much\r\nis yet to do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven therewith came the sound of other horns, and all men were silent a\r\nmoment, and then shouted all together, for the Wood-landers knew it for\r\nthe horn of the Shepherds coming on by the eastward way.\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god waved his sword aloft and set on at once, and they\r\nfollowed and gat them through the courts of the houses and their passages\r\ninto the Market-place.  There they found more room than they looked to\r\nfind; for the foemen had drawn away on the left hand toward the battle of\r\nFolk-might, and on the right hand toward the battle of the Steer; and\r\ngreat was the noise and cry that came thence.\r\n\r\nNow stood Face-of-god under the two banners of the Wolf in the\r\nMarket-place of Silver-stead, and scarce had he time to be high-hearted,\r\nfor needs must he ponder in his mind what thing were best to do.  For on\r\nthe left hand he deemed the foe was the strongest and best ordered; but\r\nthere also were the kindreds the doughtiest, and it was little like that\r\nthe felons should overcome the spear-casters of the Face and the\r\nglaive-bearers of the Sickle, and the bowmen of the Vine: there also were\r\nthe wisest leaders, as the stark elder Stone-face, and the tall\r\nHall-face, and his father of the unshaken heart, and above all\r\nFolk-might, fierce in his wrath, but his anger burning steady and clear,\r\nlike the oaken butt on the hearth of the hall.\r\n\r\nThen as his mind pictured him amongst the foe, it made therewith another\r\npicture of the slender warrior Sun-beam caught in the tangle of battle,\r\nand longing for him and calling for him amidst the hard hand-play.  And\r\nthereat his face flushed, and all his body waxed hot, and he was on the\r\nvery point of leading the onset against the foe on the left.  But\r\ntherewith he bethought him of the bold men of the Steer and the Bridge\r\nand the Bull weary with much fighting; and he remembered also that the\r\nBride was amongst them and fighting, it might be, amidst the foremost,\r\nand if she were slain how should he ever hold up his head again.  He\r\nbethought him also that the Shepherds, who had fallen on by the eastern\r\nroad, valiant as they were, were scarce so well armed or so well led as\r\nthe others.  Therewithal he bethought him (and again it came like a\r\npicture into his mind) of falling on the foemen by whom the southern\r\nbattle was beset, and then the twain of them meeting the Shepherds, and\r\nlastly, all those three companies joined together clearing the\r\nMarket-place, and meeting the men under Folk-might in the midst thereof.\r\n\r\nTherefore, scant had he been pondering these things in his mind for a\r\nminute ere he cried out: \xe2\x80\x98Blow up horns, blow up! forward banners, and\r\nfollow me, O valiant men! to the helping of the Steer, the Bridge, and\r\nthe Bull; deep have they thrust into the Dusky Throng, and belike are\r\nhard pressed.  Hark how the clamour ariseth from their besetters!  On\r\nnow, on!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith hung a star of sunlight on his sword as he raised it aloft, and\r\nthe Wolf-whoop rang out terribly in the Market-place, for now had the\r\nWoodlanders also learned it, and the hearts of the foemen sank as they\r\nheard the might and the mass thereof.  Then the battle of the Woodlanders\r\nswept round and fell upon the flank of them who were besetting the\r\nkindreds, as an iron bar smiteth the soft fir-wood; and they of the\r\nkindreds heard their cry, but faintly and confusedly, so great was the\r\nturmoil of battle about them.\r\n\r\nNow once more was Bow-may by the side of Face-of-god; and if she had not\r\nthe might of the mightiest, yet had she the deftness of the deftest.  And\r\nnow was she calm and cool, shielding herself with a copper-bossed target,\r\nand driving home the point of her sharp sword; white was her face, and\r\nher eyes glittered amidst it, and she seemed to men like to those on\r\nwhose heads the Warrior hath laid the Holy Bread.\r\n\r\nAs to Wood-wise, he had given the Banner of the red-jawed Wolf to\r\nStone-wolf, a huge and dreadful warrior some forty winters old, who had\r\nfought in the Great Overthrow, and now hewed down the Dusky Men, wielding\r\na heavy short-sword left-handed.  But Wood-wise himself fought with a\r\ngreat sword, giving great strokes to the right hand and the left, and was\r\nno more hasty than is the hewer in the winter wood.\r\n\r\nFace-of-god fought wisely and coldly now, and looked more to warding his\r\nfriends than destroying his foes, and both to Bow-may and Wood-wise his\r\nsword was a shield; for oft he took the life from the edge of the\r\nupraised axe, and stayed the point of the foeman in mid-air.\r\n\r\nEven so wisely fought the whole band of the Woodlanders and the Wolves,\r\nwho got within smiting space of the foe; for they had no will to cast\r\naway their lives when assured victory was so nigh to them.  Sooth to say,\r\nthe hand-play was not so hard to them as it had been betwixt the bent and\r\nthe houses; for the Dusky Men were intent on dealing with the men of the\r\nkindreds from the southern road, who stood war-wearied before them; and\r\nthey were hewing and casting at them, and baying and yelling like dogs;\r\nand though they turned about to meet the storm of the Woodlanders, yet\r\ntheir hearts failed them withal, and they strove to edge away from\r\nbetwixt those two fearful scythes of war, fighting as men fleeing, not as\r\nmen in onset.  But still the Woodlanders and the Wolves came on, hewing\r\nand thrusting, smiting down the foemen in heaps, till the Dusky Throng\r\ngrew thin, and the staves of the Dalesmen and their bright banners in the\r\nmorning sun were clear to see, and at last their very faces, kindly and\r\nfamiliar, worn and strained with the stress of battle, or laughing\r\nwildly, or pale with the fury of the fight.  Then rose up to the heavens\r\nthe blended shout of the Woodlanders and the Dalesmen, and now there was\r\nnought of foemen betwixt them save the dead and the wounded.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god thrust his sword into its sheath all bloody as it was,\r\nand strode over the dead men to where Hall-ward stood under the banner of\r\nthe Steer, and cast his arms about the old carle, and kissed him for joy\r\nof the victory.  But Hall-ward thrust him aback and looked him in the\r\nface, and his cheeks were pale and his lips clenched, and his eyes\r\nhaggard and staring, and he said in a harsh voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O young man, she is dead!  I saw her fall.  The Bride is dead, and thou\r\nhast lost thy troth-plight maiden. O death, death to the Dusky Men!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen grew Face-of-god as pale as a linen sleeve, and all the new-comers\r\ngroaned and cried out.  But a bystander said: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, nay, it is nought so\r\nbad as that; she is hurt, and sorely; but she liveth yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god heard him not.  He forgot Dale-warden lying in his sheath,\r\nand he saw that the last speaker had a great wood-axe broad and heavy in\r\nhis hand, so he cried: \xe2\x80\x98Man, man, thine axe!\xe2\x80\x99 and snatched it from him,\r\nand turned about to the foe again, and thrust through the ranks,\r\nsuffering none to stay him till all his friends were behind and all his\r\nfoes before him.  And as he burst forth from the ranks waving his axe\r\naloft, bare-headed now, his yellow hair flying abroad, his mouth crying\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x98Death, death, death to the Dusky Men!\xe2\x80\x99 fear of him smote their\r\nhearts, and they howled and fled before him as they might; for they said\r\nthat the Dalesmen had prayed their Gods into the battle.  But not so fast\r\ncould they flee but he was presently amidst them, smiting down all about\r\nhim, and they so terror-stricken that scarce might they raise a hand\r\nagainst him.  All that blended host followed him mad with wrath and\r\nvictory, and as they pressed on, they heard behind them the horns and\r\nwar-cries of the Shepherds falling on from the east.  Nought they heeded\r\nthat now, but drave on a fearful storm of war, and terrible was the\r\nslaughter of the Felons.\r\n\r\nIt was but a few minutes ere they had driven them up against that great\r\nstack of faggots that had been dight for the burnt-offering of men, and\r\nmany of the felons had mounted up on to it, and now in their anguish of\r\nfear were shooting arrows and casting spears on all about them, heeding\r\nlittle if they were friend or foe.  Now were the men of the kindreds at\r\npoint to climb this twiggen burg; but by this time the fury of\r\nFace-of-god had run clear, and he knew where he was and what he was\r\ndoing; so he stayed his folk, and cried out to them: \xe2\x80\x98Forbear, climb not!\r\nlet the torch help the sword!\xe2\x80\x99  And therewith he looked about and saw the\r\nfire-pot which had been set down there for the kindling of the bale-fire,\r\nand the coals were yet red in it; so he snatched up a dry brand and\r\nlighted it thereat, and so did divers others, and they thrust them among\r\nthe faggots, and the fire caught at once, and the tongues of flame began\r\nto leap from faggot to faggot till all was in a light low; for the wood\r\nhad been laid for that very end, and smeared with grease and oil so that\r\nthe burning to the god might be speedy.\r\n\r\nBut the fierceness of the kindreds heeded not the fire, nor overmuch the\r\nmen who leapt down from the stack before it, but they left all behind\r\nthem, faring straight toward the western outgate from the Market-stead;\r\nand Face-of-god still led them on; though by now he was wholly come to\r\nhis right mind again, albeit the burden of sorrow yet lay heavy on his\r\nheart.  He had broken his axe, and had once more drawn Dale-warden from\r\nhis sheath, and many felt his point and edge.\r\n\r\nBut now, as they chased, came a rush of men upon them again, as though a\r\nnew onset were at hand.  That saw Face-of-god and Hall-ward and War-well,\r\nand other wise leaders of men, and they bade their folk forbear the\r\nchase, and lock their ranks to meet the onfall of this new wave of\r\nfoemen.  And they did so, and stood fast as a wall; but lo! the onrush\r\nthat drave up against them was but a fleeing shrieking throng, and no\r\nlonger an array of warriors, for many had cast away their weapons, and\r\nwere rushing they knew not whither; for they were being thrust on the\r\nbitter edges of Face-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s companies by the terror of the fleers from\r\nthe onset of the men of the Face, the Sickle, and the Vine, whom\r\nHall-face and Stone-face were leading, along with Folk-might.  Then once\r\nagain the men of Face-of-god gave forth the whoop of victory, and pressed\r\nforward again, hewing their way through the throng of fleers, but turning\r\nnot to chase to the right or the left; while at their backs came on the\r\nShepherd-folk, who had swept down all that withstood them; for now indeed\r\nwas the Market-stead getting thinner of living men.\r\n\r\nSo led the War-leader his ordered ranks, till at last over the tangled\r\ncrowd of runaways he saw the banners of the Burg and the Face flashing\r\nagainst the sun, and heard the roar of the kindreds as they drave the\r\nchase towards them.  Then he lifted up his sword, and stood still, and\r\nall the host behind him stayed and cast a huge shout up to the heavens,\r\nand there they abode the coming of the other Dalesmen.\r\n\r\nBut the War-leader sent a message to Hound-under-Greenbury, bidding him\r\nlead the Shepherds to the chase of the Dusky Men, who were now all\r\nfleeing toward the northern outgate of the Market.  Howbeit he called to\r\nmind the throng he had seen on the northern road before they were come\r\ninto the Market-stead, and deemed that way also death awaited the foemen,\r\neven if the men of the kindreds forbore them.\r\n\r\nBut presently the space betwixt the Woodlanders and the men of the Face\r\nwas clear of all but the dead, so that friend saw the face of friend; and\r\nit could be seen that the warriors of the Face were ruddy and smiling for\r\njoy, because the battle had been easy to them, and but few of them had\r\nfallen; for the Dusky Men who had left the Market-stead to fall on them,\r\nhad had room for fleeing behind them, and had speedily turned their backs\r\nbefore the spear-casting of the men of the Face and the onrush of the\r\nswordsmen.\r\n\r\nThere then stood these victorious men facing one another, and the\r\nbanner-bearers on either side came through the throng, and brought the\r\nbanners together between the two hosts; and the Wolf kissed the Face, and\r\nthe Sickle and the Vine met the Steer and the Bridge and the Bull: but\r\nthe Shepherds were yet chasing the fleers.\r\n\r\nThere in the forefront stood Hall-face the tall, with the joy of battle\r\nin his eyes.  And Stone-face, the wise carle in war, stood solemn and\r\nstark beside him; and there was the goodly body and the fair and kindly\r\nvisage of the Alderman smiling on the faces of his friends.  But as for\r\nFolk-might, his face was yet white and aweful with anger, and he looked\r\nrestlessly up and down the front of the kindreds, though he spake no\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god could no longer forbear, but he thrust Dale-warden into\r\nhis sheath, and ran forward and cast his arms about his father\xe2\x80\x99s neck and\r\nkissed him; and the blood of himself and of the foemen was on him, for he\r\nhad been hurt in divers places, but not sorely, because of the good\r\nhammer-work of the Alderman.\r\n\r\nThen he kissed his brother and Stone-face, and he took Folk-might by the\r\nhand, and was on the point of speaking some word to him, when the ranks\r\nof the Face opened, and lo! the Sun-beam in her bright war-gear, and the\r\nsword girt to her side, and she unhurt and unsullied.\r\n\r\nThen was it to him as when he met her first in Shadowy Vale, and he\r\nthought of little else than her; but she stepped lightly up to him, and\r\nunashamed before the whole host she kissed him on the mouth, and he cast\r\nhis mailed arms about her, and joy made him forget many things and what\r\nwas next to do, though even at that moment came afresh a great clamour of\r\nshrieks and cries from the northern outgate of the Market-stead: and the\r\nburning pile behind them cast a great wavering flame into the air,\r\ncontending with the bright sun of that fair day, now come hard on\r\nnoontide.  But ere he drew away his face from the Sun-beam\xe2\x80\x99s, came memory\r\nto him, and a sharp pang shot through his heart, as he heard Folk-might\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98Where then is the Shield-may of Burgstead? where is the Bride?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Face-of-god said under his breath: \xe2\x80\x98She is dead, she is dead!\xe2\x80\x99  And\r\nthen he stared out straight before him and waited till someone else\r\nshould say it aloud.  But Bow-may stepped forward and said: \xe2\x80\x98Chief of the\r\nWolf, be of good cheer; our kinswoman is hurt, but not deadly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Alderman\xe2\x80\x99s face changed, and he said: \xe2\x80\x98Hast thou seen her, Bow-may?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98How should I leave the battle? but others have told me\r\nwho have seen her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFolk-might stared into the ranks of men before him, but said nothing.\r\nSaid the Alderman: \xe2\x80\x98Is she well tended?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bow-may, \xe2\x80\x98since she is amongst friends, and there are\r\nno foemen behind us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen came a voice from Folk-might which said: \xe2\x80\x98Now were it best to send\r\ngood men and deft in arms, and who know Silver-dale, from house to house,\r\nto search for foemen who may be lurking there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Alderman looked kindly and sadly on him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kinsman Stone-face, and Hall-face my son, the brunt of the battle is now\r\nover, and I am but a simple man amongst you; therefore, if ye will give\r\nme leave, I will go see this poor kinswoman of ours, and comfort her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey bade him go: so he sheathed his sword, and went through the press\r\nwith two men of the Steer toward the southern road; for the Bride had\r\nbeen brought into a house nigh the corner of the Market-place.\r\n\r\nBut Face-of-god looked after his father as he went, and remembrance of\r\npast days came upon him, and such a storm of grief swept over him, as he\r\nthought of the Bride lying pale and bleeding and brought anigh to her\r\ndeath, that he put his hands to his face and wept as a child that will\r\nnot be comforted; nor had he any shame of all those bystanders, who in\r\nsooth were men good and kindly, and had no shame of his grief or\r\nmarvelled at it, for indeed their own hearts were sore for their lovely\r\nkinswoman, and many of them also wept with Face-of-god.  But the Sun-beam\r\nstood by and looked on her betrothed, and she thought many things of the\r\nBride, and was sorry, albeit no tears came into her eyes; then she looked\r\naskance at Folk-might and trembled; but he said coldly, and in a loud\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Needs must we search the houses for the lurking felons, or many a man\r\nwill yet be murdered.  Let Wood-wicked lead a band of men at once from\r\nhouse to house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen said a man of the Wolf hight Hardgrip: \xe2\x80\x98Wood-wicked was slain\r\nbetwixt the bent and the houses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Let it be Wood-wise then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Bow-may said: \xe2\x80\x98Wood-wise is even now hurt in the leg by a wounded\r\nfelon, and may not go afoot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen said Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Is Crow the Shaft-speeder anigh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, here am I,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth a tall man of fifty winters, coming from out the\r\nranks where stood the Wolves.\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Kinsman Crow, do thou take two score and ten of doughty\r\nmen who are not too hot-headed, and search every house about the\r\nMarket-place; but if ye come on any house that makes a stout defence,\r\nsend ye word thereof to the Mote-house, where we will presently be, and\r\nwe shall send you help.  Slay every felon that ye fall in with; but if ye\r\nfind in the houses any of the poor folk crouching and afraid, comfort\r\ntheir hearts all ye may, and tell them that now is life come to them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Crow fell to getting his band together, and presently departed with\r\nthem on his errand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.  THE KINDREDS WIN THE MOTE-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE din and tumult still came from the north side of the Market-place, so\r\nthat all the air was full of noise; and Face-of-god deemed that the\r\nthralls had gotten weapons into their hands and were slaying their\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nNow he lifted up his face, and put his hand on Folk-might\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and\r\nsaid in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kinsmen, it were well if our brother were to bid the banners into the\r\nMote-house of the Wolf, and let all the Host set itself in array before\r\nthe said house, and abide till the chasers of the foe come to us thither;\r\nfor I perceive that they are now become many, and are more than those of\r\nour kindred.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Folk-might looked at him with kind eyes, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou sayest well, brother; even so let it be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he lifted up his sword, and Face-of-god cried out in a loud voice:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forward, banners! blow up horns! fare we forth with victory!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the Host drew its ranks together in good order, and they all set\r\nforward, and old Stone-face took the Sun-beam by the hand and led on\r\nbehind Folk-might and the War-leader.  But when they came to the Hall,\r\nthen saw they how the steps that led up to the door were high and double,\r\ngoing up from each side without any railing or fool-guard; and crowding\r\nthe stairs and the platform thereof was a band of the Dusky Men, as many\r\nas could stand thereon, who shot arrows at the host of the kindreds,\r\nhowling like dogs, and chattering like apes; and arrows and spears came\r\nfrom the windows of the Hall; yea, and on the very roof a score of these\r\nfelons were riding the ridge and mocking like the trolls of old days.\r\n\r\nNow when they saw this they stayed a while, and men shielded them against\r\nthe shafts; but the leaders drew together in front of the Host, and\r\nFolk-might fell to speech; and his face was very pale and stern; for now\r\nhe had had time to think of the case of the Bride, and fierce wrath, and\r\ngrief unholpen filled his soul.  So he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brothers, this is my business to deal with; for I see before me the\r\nstair that leadeth to the Mote-house of my people, and now would I sit\r\nthere whereas my fathers sat, when peace was on the Dale, as once more it\r\nshall be to-morrow.  Therefore up this stair will I go, and none shall\r\nhinder me; and let no man of the host follow me till I have entered into\r\nthe Hall, unless perchance I fall dead by the way; but stand ye still and\r\nlook on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98this is partly the business of the War-leader.\r\nThere are two stairs.  Be content to take the southern one, and I will\r\ntake the northern.  We shall meet on the plain stone at the top.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Hall-face said: \xe2\x80\x98War-leader, may I speak?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speak, brother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\nSaid Hall-face: \xe2\x80\x98I have done but little to-day, War-leader.  I would\r\nstand by thee on the northern stair; so shall Folk-might be content, if\r\nhe doeth two men\xe2\x80\x99s work who are not little-hearted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98The doom of the War-leader is that Folk-might shall\r\nfall on by the southern stair to slake his grief and increase his glory,\r\nand Face-of-god and Hall-face by the northern.  Haste to the work, O\r\nbrothers!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd he and Hall-face went to their places, while all looked on.  But the\r\nSun-beam, with her hand still in Stone-face\xe2\x80\x99s, she turned white to the\r\nlips, and stared with wild eyes before her, not knowing where she was;\r\nfor she had deemed that the battle was over, and Face-of-god saved from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut Folk-might tossed up his head and laughed, and cried out, \xe2\x80\x98At last,\r\nat last!\xe2\x80\x99  And his sword was in his hand, the Sleep-thorn to wit, a blade\r\nof ancient fame; so now he let it fall and hang to his wrist by the\r\nleash, while he clapped his hands together and uttered the Wolf-whoop\r\nmightily, and all the men of the Wolf that were in the host, and the\r\nWoodlanders withal, uttered it with him.  Then he put his shield over his\r\nhead and stood before the first of the steps, and the Dusky Men laughed\r\nto see one man come against them, though there was death in their hearts.\r\nBut he laughed back at them in triumph, and set his foot on the step, and\r\nlet Sleep-thorn\xe2\x80\x99s point go into the throat of a Dusky lord, and thrust\r\namongst them, hewing right and left, and tumbling men over the edge of\r\nthe stair, which was to them as the narrow path along the cliff-side that\r\nhangeth over the unfathomed sea.  They hewed and thrust at him in turn;\r\nbut so close were they packed that their weapons crossed about him, and\r\none shielded him from the other, and they swayed staggering on that\r\nfearful verge, while the Sleep-thorn crept here and there amongst them,\r\nlulling their hot fury.  For, as desperate as they were, and fighting for\r\ndeath and not for life, they had a horror of him and of the sea of hatred\r\nbelow them, and feared where to set their feet, and he feared nought at\r\nall, but from feet to sword-point was but an engine of slaughter, while\r\nthe heart within him throbbed with fury long held back as he thought upon\r\nthe Bride and her wounding, and all the wrongs of his people since their\r\nGreat Undoing.\r\n\r\nSo he smote and thrust, till him-seemed the throng of foes thinned before\r\nhim: with his sword-pommel he smote a lord of the Dusky Ones in the face,\r\nso that he fell over the edge amongst the spears of the kindred; then he\r\nthrust the point of Sleep-thorn towards the Hall-door through the breast\r\nof another, and then it seemed to him that he had but one before him; so\r\nhe hove up the edges to cleave him down, but ere the stroke fell, close\r\nto his ears exceeding loud rang out the cry, \xe2\x80\x98For the Burg and the Face!\r\nfor the Face, for the Face!\xe2\x80\x99 and he drew aback a little, and his eyes\r\ncleared, and lo! it was Hall-face the tall, his long sword all reddened\r\nwith battle; and beside him stood Face-of-god, silent and panting, his\r\nface pale with the fierce anger of the fight, and the weariness which was\r\nnow at last gaining upon him.  There stood those three with no other\r\nliving man upon the plain of the stairs.\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god turned shouting to the Folk, and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forth now with the banners!  For now is the Wolf come home.  On into the\r\nHall, O Kindred of the Gods!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen poured the Folk up over the stairs and into the Hall of the Wolf,\r\nthe banners flapping over their heads; and first went the War-leader and\r\nFolk-might and Hall-face, and then the three delivered thralls,\r\nWolf-stone, God-swain, and Spear-fist, and Dallach with them, though both\r\nhe and Wolf-stone had been hurt in the battle; and then came blended\r\ntogether the Men of the Face along with them of the Wolf who had entered\r\nthe Market-stead with them, and with these were Stone-face and Wood-wont\r\nand Bow-may, leading the Sun-beam betwixt them; and now was she come to\r\nherself again, though her face was yet pale, and her eyes gleamed as she\r\nstepped across the threshold of the Hall.\r\n\r\nBut when a many were gotten in, and the first-comers had had time to\r\nhandle their weapons and look about them, a cry of the utmost wrath broke\r\nfrom Folk-might and those others who remembered the Hall from of old.\r\nFor wretched and befouled was that well-builded house: the hangings rent\r\naway; the goodly painted walls daubed and smeared with wicked tokens of\r\nthe Alien murderers: the floor, once bright with polished stones of the\r\nmountain, and strewn with sweet-smelling flowers, was now as foul as the\r\nden of the man-devouring troll of the heaths.  From the fair-carven roof\r\nof oak and chestnut-beams hung ugly knots of rags and shapeless images of\r\nthe sorcery of the Dusky Men.  And furthermore, and above all, from the\r\nlast tie-beam of the roof over the da\xc3\xafs dangled four shapes of\r\nmen-at-arms, whom the older men of the Wolf knew at once for the embalmed\r\nbodies of their four great chieftains, who had been slain on the day of\r\nthe Great Undoing; and they cried out with horror and rage as they saw\r\nthem hanging there in their weapons as they had lived.\r\n\r\nThere was the Hostage of the Earth, his shield painted with the green\r\nworld circled with the worm of the sea.  There was the older Folk-might,\r\nthe uncle of the living man, bearing a shield with an oak and a lion done\r\nthereon.  There was Wealth-eker, on whose shield was done a golden sheaf\r\nof wheat.  There was he who bore a name great from of old, Folk-wolf to\r\nwit, bearing on his shield the axe of the hewer.  There they hung, dusty,\r\nbefouled, with sightless eyes and grinning mouths, in the dimmed sunlight\r\nof the Hall, before the eyes of that victorious Host, stricken silent at\r\nthe sight of them.\r\n\r\nUnderneath them on the da\xc3\xafs stood the last remnant of the battle of the\r\nDusky Men; and they, as men mad with coming death, shook their weapons,\r\nand with shrieking laughter mocked at the overcomers, and pointed to the\r\nlong-dead chiefs, and called on them in the tongue of the kindreds to\r\ncome down and lead their dear kinsmen to the high-seat; and then they\r\ncried out to the living warriors of the Wolf, and bade them better their\r\ndeed of slaying, and set to work to make alive again, and cause their\r\nkinsmen to live merry on the earth.\r\n\r\nWith that last mock they handled their weapons and rushed howling on the\r\nwarriors to meet their death; nor was it long denied them; for the sword\r\nof the Wolf, the axe of the Woodland, and the spear of the Dale soon made\r\nan end of the dreadful lives of these destroyers of the Folks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.  MEN SING IN THE MOTE-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN strode the Warriors of the Wolf over the bodies of the slain on to\r\nthe da\xc3\xafs of their own Hall; and Folk-might led the Sun-beam by the hand,\r\nand now was his sword in its sheath, and his face was grown calm, though\r\nit was stern and sad.  But even as he trod the da\xc3\xafs comes a slim swain of\r\nthe Wolves twisting himself through the throng, and so maketh way to\r\nFolk-might, and saith to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chieftain, the Alderman of Burgdale sendeth me hither to say a word to\r\nthee; even this, which I am to tell to thee and the War-leader both: It\r\nis most true that our kinswoman the Bride will not die, but live.  So\r\nhelp me, the Warrior and the Face!  This is the word of the Alderman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Folk-might heard this, his face changed and he hung his head; and\r\nFace-of-god, who was standing close by, beheld him and deemed that tears\r\nwere falling from his eyes on to the hall-floor.  As for him, he grew\r\nexceeding glad, and he turned to the Sun-beam and met her eyes, and saw\r\nthat she could scarce refrain her longing for him; and he was abashed for\r\nthe sweetness of his love.  But she drew close up to him, and spake to\r\nhim softly and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the day that maketh amends; and yet I long for another day.\r\nWhen I saw thee coming to me that first day in Shadowy Vale, I thought\r\nthee so goodly a warrior that my heart was in my mouth.  But now how\r\ngoodly thou art!  For the battle is over, and we shall live.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98and none shall begrudge us our love.  Behold\r\nthy brother, the hard-heart, the warrior; he weepeth because he hath\r\nheard that the Bride shall live.  Be sure then that she shall not gainsay\r\nhim.  O fair shall the world be to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she said: \xe2\x80\x98O Gold-mane, I have no words.  Is there no minstrelsy\r\namongst us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow by this time were many of the men of the Wolf and the Woodlanders\r\ngathered on the da\xc3\xafs of the Hall; and the Dalesmen noting this, and\r\nwotting that these men were now in their own Mote-house, withdrew them as\r\nthey might for the press toward the nether end thereof.  That the\r\nSun-beam noted, and that all those about her save the War-leader were of\r\nthe kindreds of the Wolf and the Woodland, and, still speaking softly,\r\nshe said to Face-of-god:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, meseemeth I am now in my wrong place; for now the Wolf\r\nraiseth up his head, but I am departing from him.  Surely I should now be\r\nstanding amongst my people of the Face, whereto I am going ere long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Beloved, I am now become thy kindred and thine home, and it is\r\nmeet for thee to stand beside me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe cast her eyes adown and answered not; and she fell a-pondering of how\r\nsorely she had desired that fair dale, and now she would leave it, and be\r\ncontent and more than content.\r\n\r\nBut now the kindreds had sundered, they upon the da\xc3\xafs ranked themselves\r\ntogether there in the House which their fathers had builded; and when\r\nthey saw themselves so meetly ordered, their hearts being full with the\r\nsweetness of hope accomplished and the joy of deliverance from death,\r\nsong arose amongst them, and they fell to singing together; and this is\r\nsomewhat of their singing:\r\n\r\n      Now raise we the lay\r\n      Of the long-coming day!\r\n      Bright, white was the sun\r\n      When we saw it begun:\r\n      O\xe2\x80\x99er its noon now we live;\r\n      It hath ceased not to give;\r\n      It shall give, and give more\r\n      From the wealth of its store.\r\n   O fair was the yesterday!  Kindly and good\r\n   Was the wasteland our guester, and kind was the wood;\r\n   Though below us for reaping lay under our hand\r\n   The harvest of weeping, the grief of the land;\r\n   Dumb cowered the sorrow, nought daring to cry\r\n   On the help of to-morrow, the deed drawing nigh.\r\n\r\n      All increase throve\r\n      In the Dale of our love;\r\n      There the ox and the steed\r\n      Fed down the mead;\r\n      The grapes hung high\r\n      \xe2\x80\x99Twixt earth and sky,\r\n      And the apples fell\r\n      Round the orchard well.\r\n   Yet drear was the land there, and all was for nought;\r\n   None put forth a hand there for what the year wrought,\r\n   And raised it o\xe2\x80\x99erflowing with gifts of the earth.\r\n   For man\xe2\x80\x99s grief was growing beside of the mirth\r\n   Of the springs and the summers that wasted their wealth;\r\n   And the birds, the new-comers, made merry by stealth.\r\n\r\n      Yet here of old\r\n      Abode the bold;\r\n      Nor had they wailed\r\n      Though the wheat had failed,\r\n      And the vine no more\r\n      Gave forth her store.\r\n      Yea, they found the waste good\r\n      For the fearless of mood.\r\n   Then to these, that were dwelling aloof from the Dale,\r\n   Fared the wild-wind a-telling the worst of the tale;\r\n   As men bathed in the morning they saw in the pool\r\n   The image of scorning, the throne of the fool.\r\n   The picture was gleaming in helm and in sword,\r\n   And shone forth its seeming from cups of the board.\r\n\r\n      Forth then they came\r\n      With the battle-flame;\r\n      From the Wood and the Waste\r\n      And the Dale did they haste:\r\n      They saw the storm rise,\r\n      And with untroubled eyes\r\n      The war-storm they met;\r\n      And the rain ruddy-wet.\r\n   O\xe2\x80\x99er the Dale then was litten the Candle of Day,\r\n   Night-sorrow was smitten, and gloom fled away.\r\n   How the grief-shackles sunder!  How many to morn\r\n   Shall awaken and wonder how gladness was born!\r\n   O wont unto sorrow, how sweet unto you\r\n   Shall be pondering to-morrow what deed is to do!\r\n\r\n      Fell many a man\r\n      \xe2\x80\x99Neath the edges wan,\r\n      In the heat of the play\r\n      That fashioned the day.\r\n      Praise all ye then\r\n      The death of men,\r\n      And the gift of the aid\r\n      Of the unafraid!\r\n   O strong are the living men mighty to save,\r\n   And good is their giving, and gifts that we have!\r\n   But the dead, they that gave us once, never again;\r\n   Long and long shall they save us sore trouble and pain.\r\n   O Banner above us, O God of the strong,\r\n   Love them as ye love us that bore down our wrong!\r\n\r\nSo they sang in the Hall; and there was many a man wept, as the song\r\nended, for those that should never see the good days of the Dale, and all\r\nthe joy that was to be; and men swore, by all that they loved, that they\r\nwould never forget those that had fallen in the Winning of Silver-dale;\r\nand that when each year the Cups of Memory went round, they should be no\r\nmere names to them, but the very men whom they had known and loved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.  DALLACH FARETH TO ROSE-DALE: CROW TELLETH OF HIS ERRAND:\r\nTHE KINDREDS EAT THEIR MEAT IN SILVER-DALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW Dallach, who had gone away for a while, came back again into the\r\nHall; and at his back were a half score of men who bore ladders with\r\nthem: they were stout men, clad in scanty and ragged raiment, but girt\r\nwith swords and bearing axes, those of them who were not handling the\r\nladders.  Men looked on them curiously, because they saw them to be of\r\nthe roughest of the thralls.  They were sullen and fierce-eyed to behold,\r\nand their hands and bare arms were flecked with blood; and it was easy to\r\nsee that they had been chasing the fleers, and making them pay for their\r\nmany torments of past days.\r\n\r\nBut when Face-of-god beheld this he cried out: \xe2\x80\x98Ho, Dallach! is it so\r\nthat thou hast bethought thee to bring in hither men to fall to the\r\ncleansing of the Hall, and to do away the defiling of the Dusky Men?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even so, War-leader,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dallach; \xe2\x80\x98also ye shall know that all battle\r\nis over in Silver-stead; for the thralls fell in numbers not to be\r\nendured on the Dusky Men who had turned their backs to us, and hindered\r\nthem from fleeing north.  But though they have slain many, they have not\r\nslain all, and the remnant have fled by divers ways westaway, that they\r\nmay gain the wood and the ways to Rose-dale; and the stoutest of the\r\nthralls are at their heels, and ever as they go fresh men from the fields\r\njoin in the chase with great joy.  I have gathered together of the best\r\nof them two hundreds and a half well-armed; and if thou wilt give me\r\nleave, I will get to me yet more, and follow hard on the fleers, and so\r\nget me home to Rose-dale; for thither will these runaways to meet whatso\r\nof their kind may be left there.  Also I would fain be there to set some\r\norder amongst the poor folk of mine own people, whom this day\xe2\x80\x99s work hath\r\ndelivered from torment.  And if thou wilt suffer a few men of the\r\nDalesmen to come along with me, then shall all things be better done\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Luck go with thine hands!\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.  \xe2\x80\x98Take whomso thou wilt of\r\nthe Burgdalers that have a mind to fare with thee to the number of five\r\nscore; and send word of thy thriving to Folk-might, the chieftain of the\r\nDale; as for us, meseemeth that we shall abide here no long while.  How\r\nsayest thou, Folk-might, shall Dallach go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Folk-might, who stood close beside him, looked up and reddened\r\nsomewhat, as a man caught heedless when he should be heedful; but he\r\nlooked kindly on Face-of-god, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98War-leader, so long as thou art in the Dale which ye kindreds have won\r\nback for us, thou art the chieftain, and no other, and I bid thee do as\r\nthou wilt in this matter, and in all things; and I hereby give command to\r\nall my kindred to do according to thy will everywhere and always, as they\r\nlove me; and indeed I deem that thy will shall be theirs; since it is\r\nonly fools who know not their well-wishers.  How say ye, kinsmen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen those about cried out: \xe2\x80\x98Hail to Face-of-god!  Hail to the Dalesmen!\r\nHail to our friends!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Folk-might went up to Face-of-god, and threw his arms about him and\r\nkissed him, and he said therewithal, so that most men heard him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Herewith I kiss not only thee, thou goodly and glorious warrior! but\r\nthis kiss and embrace is for all the men of the kindreds of the Dale and\r\nthe Shepherds; since I deem that never have men more valiant dwelt upon\r\nthe earth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith all men shouted for joy of him, and were exceeding glad; but\r\nFolk-might spake apart to Face-of-god and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brother, I suppose that thou wilt deem it good to abide in this Hall or\r\nanigh it; for hereabouts now is the heart of the Host.  But as for me, I\r\nwould have leave to depart for a little; since I have an errand, whereof\r\nthou mayest wot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god smiled on him, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Go, and all good go with thee;\r\nand tell my father that I would have tidings, since I may not be there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSo he spake; yet in his heart was he glad that he might not go to behold\r\nthe Bride lying sick and sorry.  But Folk-might departed without more\r\nwords; and in the door of the Hall he met Crow the Shaft-speeder, who\r\nwould have spoken to him, and given him the tidings; but Folk-might said\r\nto him: \xe2\x80\x98Do thine errand to the War-leader, who is within the Hall.\xe2\x80\x99  And\r\nso went on his way.\r\n\r\nThen came Crow up the Hall, and stood before Face-of-god and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98War-leader, we have done that which was to be done, and have cleared all\r\nthe houses about the Market-stead.  Moreover, by the rede of Dallach we\r\nhave set certain men of the poor folk of the Dale, who are well looked to\r\nby the others, to the burying of the slain felons; and they be digging\r\ntrenches in the fields on the north side of the Market-stead, and carry\r\nthe carcasses thither as they may.  But the slain whom they find of the\r\nkindreds do they array out yonder before this Hall.  In all wise are\r\nthese men tame and biddable, save that they rage against the Dusky Men,\r\nthough they fear them yet.  As for us, they deem us Gods come down from\r\nheaven to help them.  So much for what is good: now have I an ill word to\r\nsay; to wit, that in the houses whereas we have found many thralls alive,\r\nyet also have we found many dead; for amongst these murder-carles were\r\nsome of an evil sort, who, when they saw that the battle would go against\r\nthem, rushed into the houses hewing down all before them\xe2\x80\x94man, woman, and\r\nchild; so that many of the halls and chambers we saw running blood like\r\nto shambles.  To be short: of them whom they were going to hew to the\r\nGods, we have found thirteen living and three dead, of which latter is\r\none woman; and of the living, seven women; and all these, living and\r\ndead, with the leaden shackles yet on them wherein they should be burned.\r\nTo all these and others whom we have found, we have done what of service\r\nwe could in the way of victual and clothes, so that they scarce believe\r\nthat they are on this lower earth.  Moreover, I have with me two score of\r\nthem, who are men of some wits, and who know of the stores of victual and\r\nother wares which the felons had, and these will fetch and carry for you\r\nas much as ye will.  Is all done rightly, War-leader?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98and we give thee our thanks therefor.\r\nAnd now it were well if these thy folk were to dight our dinner for us in\r\nsome green field the nighest that may be, and thither shall all the Host\r\nbe bidden by sound of horn.  Meantime, let us void this Hall till it be\r\ncleansed of the filth of the Dusky Ones; but hereafter shall we come\r\nagain to it, and light a fire on the Holy Hearth, and bid the Gods and\r\nthe Fathers come back and behold their children sitting glad in the\r\nancient Hall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen men shouted and were exceeding joyous; but Face-of-god said once\r\nmore: \xe2\x80\x98Bear ye a bench out into the Market-place over against the door of\r\nthis Hall: thereon will I sit with other chieftains of the kindreds, that\r\nwhoso will may have recourse to us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo therewith all the men of the kindreds made their ways out of the Hall\r\nand into the Market-stead, which was by this time much cleared of the\r\nslaughtered felons; and the bale for the burnt-offering was now but\r\nsmouldering, and a thin column of blue smoke was going up wavering amidst\r\nthe light airs of the afternoon.  Men were somewhat silent now; for they\r\nwere stiff and weary with the morning\xe2\x80\x99s battle; and a many had been hurt\r\nwithal; and on many there yet rested the after-grief of battle, and\r\nsorrow for the loss of friends and well-wishers.\r\n\r\nFor in the battle had fallen one long hundred and two of the men of the\r\nHost; and of these were two score and five of the kindreds of the Steer,\r\nthe Bull, and the Bridge, who had made such valiant onslaught by the\r\nsouthern road.  Of the Shepherds died one score save three; for though\r\nthey scattered the foe at once, yet they fell on with such headlong\r\nvalour, rather than wisely, that many were trapped in the throng of the\r\nDusky Men.  Of the Woodlanders were slain one score and nine; for hard\r\nhad been the fight about them, and no man of them spared himself one\r\nwhit.  Of the men of the Wolf, who were but a few, fell sixteen men, and\r\nall save two of these in Face-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s battle.  Of the Burgdale men whom\r\nFolk-might led, to wit, them of the Face, the Vine, and the Sickle, were\r\nbut seven men slain outright.  In this tale are told all those who died\r\nof their hurts after the day of battle.  Therewithal many others were\r\nsorely hurt who mended, and went about afterwards hale and hearty.\r\n\r\nSo as the folk abode in the Market-place, somewhat faint and weary, they\r\nheard horns blow up merrily, and Crow the Shaft-speeder came forth and\r\nstood on the mound of the altar, and bade men fare to dinner, and\r\ntherewith he led the way, bearing in his hand the banner of the Golden\r\nBushel, of which House he was; and they followed him into a fair and\r\ngreat mead on the southwest of Silver-stead, besprinkled about with\r\nancient trees of sweet chestnut.  There they found the boards spread for\r\nthem with the best of victual which the poor down-trodden folk knew how\r\nto dight for them; and especially was there great plenty of good wine of\r\nthe sun-smitten bents.\r\n\r\nSo they fell to their meat, and the poor folk, both men and women, served\r\nthem gladly, though they were somewhat afeard of these fierce\r\nsword-wielders, the Gods who had delivered them.  The said thralls were\r\nmostly not of those who had fallen so bitterly on their fleeing masters,\r\nbut were men and women of the households, not so roughly treated as the\r\nothers, that is to say, those who had been wont to toil under the lash in\r\nthe fields and the silver-mines, and were as wild as they durst be.\r\n\r\nAs for these waiting-thralls, the men of the kindreds were gentle and\r\nblithe with them, and often as they served them would they stay their\r\nhands (and especially if they were women), and would draw down their\r\nheads to put a morsel in their mouths, or set the wine-cup to their lips;\r\nand they would stroke them and caress them, and treat them in all wise as\r\ntheir dear friends.  Moreover, when any man was full, he would arise and\r\ntake hold of one of the thralls, and set him in his place, and serve him\r\nwith meat and drink, and talk with him kindly, so that the poor folk were\r\nmuch bewildered with joy.  And the first that arose from table were the\r\nSun-beam and Bow-may and Hall-face, with many of the swains and the women\r\nof the Woodlanders; and they went from table to table serving the others.\r\n\r\nThe Sun-beam had done off her armour, and went about exceeding fair and\r\nlovely in her kirtle; but Bow-may yet bore her hauberk, for she loved it,\r\nand indeed it was so fine and well-wrought that it was no great burden.\r\nAlbeit she had gone down with the Sun-beam and other women to a fair\r\nstream thereby, and there had they bathed and washed themselves; and\r\nBow-may\xe2\x80\x99s hurts, which were not great, had been looked to and bound up\r\nafresh, and she had come to table unhelmed, with a wreath of wind-flowers\r\nround her head.\r\n\r\nThere then they feasted; and their hearts were strengthened by the meat\r\nand drink; and if sorrow were blended with their joy, yet were they\r\nhigh-hearted through both joy and sorrow, looking forward to the good\r\ndays to be in the Dales at the Roots of the Mountains, and the love and\r\nfellowship of Folks and of Houses.\r\n\r\nBut as for Face-of-god, he went not to the meadow, but abode sitting on\r\nthe bench in the Market-place, where were none else now of the kindreds\r\nsave the appointed warders.  They had brought him a morsel and a cup of\r\nwine, and he had eaten and drunk; and now he sat there with Dale-warden\r\nlying sheathed across his knees, and seeming to gaze on the thralls of\r\nSilver-dale busied in carrying away the bodies of the slain felons, after\r\nthey had stripped them of their raiment and weapons.  Yet indeed all this\r\nwas before his eyes as a picture which he noted not.  Rather he sat\r\npondering many things; wondering at his being there in Silver-dale in the\r\nhour of victory; longing for the peace of Burgdale and the bride-chamber\r\nof the Sun-beam.  Then went his thought out toward his old playmate lying\r\nhurt in Silver-dale; and his heart was grieved because of her, yet not\r\nfor long, though his thought still dwelt on her; since he deemed that she\r\nwould live and presently be happy\xe2\x80\x94and happy thenceforward for many years.\r\nSo pondered Face-of-god in the Market-place of Silver-dale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.  FOLK-MIGHT SEETH THE BRIDE AND SPEAKETH WITH HER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW tells the tale of Folk-might, that he went his ways from the Hall to\r\nthe house where the Bride lay; and the swain who had brought the message\r\nwent along with him, and he was proud of walking beside so mighty a\r\nwarrior, and he talked to Folk-might as they went; and the sound of his\r\nvoice was irksome to the chieftain, but he made as though he hearkened.\r\nYet when they came to the door of the house, which was just out of the\r\nPlace on the Southern road (for thereby had the Bride fallen to earth),\r\nhe could withhold his grief no longer, but turned on the threshold and\r\nlaid his head on the door-jamb, and sobbed and wept till the tears fell\r\ndown like rain.  And the boy stood by wondering, and wishing that\r\nFolk-might would forbear weeping, but durst not speak to him.\r\n\r\nIn a while Folk-might left weeping and went in, and found a fair hall\r\nsore befouled by the felons, and in the corner on a bed covered with furs\r\nthe wounded woman; and at first sight he deemed her not so pale as he\r\nlooked to see her, as she lay with her long dark-red hair strewed over\r\nthe pillow, her head moving about wearily.  A linen cloth was thrown over\r\nher body, but her arms lay out of it before her.  Beside her sat the\r\nAlderman, his face sober enough, but not as one in heavy sorrow; and\r\nanigh him was another chair as if someone had but just got up from it.\r\nThere was no one else in the hall save two women of the Woodlanders, one\r\nof whom was cooking some potion on the hearth, and another was sweeping\r\nthe floor anigh of bran or some such stuff, which had been thrown down to\r\nsop up the blood.\r\n\r\nSo Folk-might went up to the Bride, sorely dreading the image of death\r\nwhich she had grown to be, and sorely loving the woman she was and would\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nHe knelt down by the bedside, heeding Iron-face little, though he nodded\r\nfriendly to him, and he held his face close to hers; but she had her eyes\r\nshut and did not open them till he had been there a little while; and\r\nthen they opened and fixed themselves on his without surprise or change.\r\nThen she lifted her right hand (for it was in her left shoulder and side\r\nthat she had been hurt) and slowly laid it on his head, and drew his face\r\nto hers and kissed it fondly, as she both smiled and let the tears run\r\nover from her eyes.  Then she spake in a weak voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou seest, chieftain and dear friend, that I may not stand by thy\r\nvictorious side to-day.  And now, though I were fain if thou wouldst\r\nnever leave me, yet needs must thou go about thy work, since thou art\r\nbecome the Alderman of the Folk of Silver-dale.  Yea, and even if thou\r\nwert not to go from me, yet in a manner should I go from thee.  For I am\r\ngrievously hurt, and I know by myself, and also the leeches have told me,\r\nthat the fever is a-coming on me; so that presently I shall not know\r\nthee, but may deem thee to be a woman, or a hound, or the very Wolf that\r\nis the image of the Father of thy kindred; or even, it may be, someone\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x94that I have played with time agone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered and faded out here, and she was silent a while; then\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So depart, kind friend and dear love, bearing this word with thee, that\r\nshould I die, I call on Iron-face my kinsman to bear witness that I bid\r\nthee carry me to bale in Silver-dale, and lay mine ashes with the ashes\r\nof thy Fathers, with whom thine own shall mingle at the last, since I\r\nhave been of the warriors who have helped to bring thee aback to the land\r\nof thy folk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she smiled and shut her eyes and said: \xe2\x80\x98And if I live, as indeed I\r\nhope, and how glad and glad I shall be to live, then shalt thou bring me\r\nto thy house and thy bed, that I may not depart from thee while both our\r\nlives last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she opened her eyes and looked at him; and he might not speak for a\r\nwhile, so ravished as he was betwixt joy and sorrow.  But the Alderman\r\narose and took a gold ring from off his arm, and spake:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the gold ring of the God of the Face, and I bear it on mine arm\r\nbetwixt the Folk and the God in all man-motes, and I bore it through the\r\nbattle to-day; and it is as holy a ring as may be; and since ye are\r\nplighting troth, and I am the witness thereof, it were good that ye held\r\nthis ring together and called the God to witness, who is akin to the God\r\nof the Earth, as we all be.  Take the ring, Folk-might, for I trust thee;\r\nand of all women now alive would I have this woman happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Folk-might took the ring and thrust his hand through it, and took her\r\nhand, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye Fathers, thou God of the Face, thou Earth-god, thou Warrior, bear\r\nwitness that my life and my body are plighted to this woman, the Bride of\r\nthe House of the Steer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis face was flushed and bright as he spoke, but as his words ceased he\r\nnoted how feebly her hand lay in his, and his face fell, and he gazed on\r\nher timidly.  But she lay quiet, and said softly and slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Fathers of my kindred!  O Warrior and God of the Earth! bear witness\r\nthat I plight my troth to this man, to lie in his grave if I die, and in\r\nhis bed if I live.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she smiled on him again, and then closed her eyes; but opened them\r\npresently once more, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear friend, how fared it with Gold-mane to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98So well he did, that none might have done better.  He\r\nfared in the fight as if he had been our Father the Warrior: he is a\r\ngreat chieftain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Wilt thou give him this message from me, that in no wise he\r\nforget the oath which he swore upon the finger-ring as it lay on the\r\nsundial of the Garden of the Face?  And say, moreover, that I am sorry\r\nthat we shall part, and have between us such breadth of wild-wood and\r\nmountain-neck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, surely will I give thy message,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might; and in his heart\r\nhe rejoiced, because he heard her speak as if she were sure of life.\r\nThen she said faintly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is now thy work to depart from me, and to do as it behoveth a\r\nchieftain of the people and the Alderman of Silver-dale.  Depart, lest\r\nthe leeches chide me: farewell, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he laid his face to hers and kissed her, and rose up and embraced\r\nIron-face, and went his ways without looking back.\r\n\r\nBut just over the threshold he met old Hall-ward of the House of the\r\nSteer, who was at point to enter, and he greeted him kindly.  The old man\r\nlooked on him steadily, and said: \xe2\x80\x98To-morrow or the day after I will\r\nutter a word to thee, O Chief of the Wolf.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a good hour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98for all thy words are true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTherewith he gat him away from the house, and came to Face-of-god, where\r\nhe sat before the altar of the Crooked Sword; and now were the chiefs\r\ncome back from their meat, and were sitting with him; there also were\r\nWood-father and Wood-wont; but Bow-may was with the Sun-beam, who was\r\nresting softly in the fair meadow after all the turmoil.\r\n\r\nSo men made place for Folk-might beside the War-leader, who looked upon\r\nhis face, and saw that it was sober and unsmiling, but not heavy or moody\r\nwith grief.  So he deemed that all was as well as it might be with the\r\nBride, and with a good heart fell to taking counsel with the others; and\r\nkindly and friendly were the redes which they held there, with no\r\ngainsaying of man by man, for the whole folk was glad at heart.\r\n\r\nSo there they ordered all matters duly for that present time, and by then\r\nthey had made an end, it was past sunset, and men were lodged in the\r\nchief houses about the Market-stead.\r\n\r\nAlbeit, though they ate their meat with all joy of heart, and were merry\r\nin converse one with the other, the men of the Wolf would by no means\r\nfeast in their Hall again till it had been cleansed and hallowed anew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.  THE DEAD BORNE TO BALE: THE MOTE-HOUSE RE-HALLOWED.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the morrow they bore to bale their slain men, and there withal what\r\nwas left of the bodies of the four chieftains of the Great Undoing.  They\r\nbrought them into a most fair meadow to the west of Silver-stead, where\r\nthey had piled up a very great bale for the burning.  In that meadow was\r\nthe Doom-ring and Thing-stead of the Folk of the Wolf, and they had\r\nhallowed it when they had first conquered Silver-dale, and it was deemed\r\nfar holier than the Mote-house aforesaid, wherein the men of the kindred\r\nmight hold no due court; but rather it was a Feast-hall, and a house\r\nwhere men had converse together, and wherein precious things and tokens\r\nof the Fathers were stored up.\r\n\r\nThe Thing-stead in the meadow was flowery and well-grassed, and a little\r\nstream winding about thereby nearly cast a ring around it; and beyond the\r\nstream was a full fair grove of oak-trees, very tall and ancient.  There\r\nthen they burned the dead of the Host, wrapped about in exceeding fair\r\nraiment.  And when the ashes were gathered, the men of Burgdale and the\r\nShepherds left those of their folk for the kindred to bury there in\r\nSilver-dale; for they said that they had a right to claim such guesting\r\nfor them that had helped to win back the Dale.\r\n\r\nBut when the Burning was done and the bale quenched, and the ashes\r\ngathered and buried (and that was on the morrow), then men bore forth the\r\nBanners of the Jaws of the Wolf, and the Red Hand, and the Silver Arm,\r\nand the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged Sword, and the Wolf of the\r\nWoodland; and with great joy and triumph they brought them into the\r\nMote-house and hung them up over the da\xc3\xafs; and they kindled fire on the\r\nHoly Hearth by holding up a disk of bright glass to the sun; and then\r\nthey sang before the banners.  And this is somewhat of the song that they\r\nsang before them:\r\n\r\n   Why are ye wending?  O whence and whither?\r\n      What shineth over the fallow swords?\r\n   What is the joy that ye bear in hither?\r\n      What is the tale of your blended words?\r\n\r\n   No whither we wend, but here have we stayed us,\r\n      Here by the ancient Holy Hearth;\r\n   Long have the moons and the years delayed us,\r\n      But here are we come from the heart of the dearth.\r\n\r\n   We are the men of joy belated;\r\n      We are the wanderers over the waste;\r\n   We are but they that sat and waited,\r\n      Watching the empty winds make haste.\r\n\r\n   Long, long we sat and knew no others,\r\n      Save alien folk and the foes of the road;\r\n   Till late and at last we met our brothers,\r\n      And needs must we to the old abode.\r\n\r\n   For once on a day they prayed for guesting;\r\n      And how were we then their bede to do?\r\n   Wild was the waste for the people\xe2\x80\x99s resting,\r\n      And deep the wealth of the Dale we knew.\r\n\r\n   Here were the boards that we must spread them\r\n      Down in the fruitful Dale and dear;\r\n   Here were the halls where we would bed them:\r\n      And how should we tarry otherwhere?\r\n\r\n   Over the waste we came together:\r\n      There was the tangle athwart the way;\r\n   There was the wind-storm and the weather;\r\n      The red rain darkened down the day.\r\n\r\n   But that day of the days what grief should let us,\r\n      When we saw through the clouds the dale-glad sun?\r\n   We tore at the tangle that beset us,\r\n      And stood at peace when the day was done.\r\n\r\n   Hall of the Happy, take our greeting!\r\n      Bid thou the Fathers come and see\r\n   The Folk-signs on thy walls a-meeting,\r\n      And deem to-day what men we be.\r\n\r\n   Look on the Holy Hearth new-litten,\r\n      How the sparks fly twinkling up aloof!\r\n   How the wavering smoke by the sunlight smitten,\r\n      Curls up around the beam-rich roof!\r\n\r\n   For here once more is the Wolf abiding,\r\n      Nor ever more from the Dale shall wend,\r\n   And never again his head be hiding,\r\n      Till all days be dark and the world have end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.  OF THE NEW BEGINNING OF GOOD DAYS IN SILVER-DALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the third day there was high-tide and great joy amongst all men from\r\nend to end of the Dale; and the delivered thralls were feasted and made\r\nmuch of by the kindreds, so that they scarce knew how to believe their\r\nown five senses that told them the good tidings.\r\n\r\nFor none strove to grieve them and torment them; what they would, that\r\ndid they, and they had all things plenteously; since for all was there\r\nenough and to spare of goods stored up for the Dusky Men, as corn and\r\nwine and oil and spices, and raiment and silver.  Horses were there also,\r\nand neat and sheep and swine in abundance.  Withal there was the good and\r\ndear land; the waxing corn on the acres; the blossoming vines on the\r\nhillside; and about the orchards and alongside the ways, the plum-trees\r\nand cherry-trees and pear-trees that had cast their blossom and were\r\noverhung with little young fruit; and the fair apple-trees a-blossoming,\r\nand the chestnuts spreading their boughs from their twisted trunks over\r\nthe green grass.  And there was the goodly pasture for the horses and the\r\nneat, and the thymy hill-grass for the sheep; and beyond it all, the\r\nthicket of the great wood, with its unfailing store of goodly timber of\r\nash and oak and holly and yoke-elm.  There need no man lack unless man\r\ncompelled him, and all was rich enough and wide enough for the waxing of\r\na very great folk.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, men betook them to what was their own before the coming\r\nof the Dusky Men; and though at first many of the delivered thrall-folk\r\nfeasted somewhat above measure, and though there were some of them who\r\nwere not very brisk at working on the earth for their livelihood; yet\r\nwere the most part of them quick of wit and deft of hand, and they mostly\r\nfell to presently at their cunning, both of husbandry and handicraft.\r\nMoreover, they had great love of the kindreds, and especially of the\r\nWoodlanders, and strove to do all things that might pleasure them.  And\r\nas for those who were dull and listless because of their many torments of\r\nthe last ten years, they would at least fetch and carry willingly for\r\nthem of the kindreds; and these last grudged them not meat and raiment\r\nand house-room, even if they wrought but little for it, because they\r\ncalled to mind the evil days of their thralldom, and bethought them how\r\nfew are men\xe2\x80\x99s days upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThus all things throve in Silver-dale, and the days wore on toward the\r\nsummer, and the Yule-tide rest beyond it, and the years beyond and far\r\nbeyond the winning of Silver-dale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.  OF THE WORD WHICH HALL-WARD OF THE STEER HAD FOR\r\nFOLK-MIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT of the time then passing, it is to be said that the whole host abode\r\nin Silver-dale in great mirth and good liking, till they should hear\r\ntidings of Dallach and his company, who had followed hot-foot on the\r\nfleers of the Dusky Men.  And on the tenth day after the battle,\r\nIron-face and his two sons and Stone-face were sitting about sunset under\r\na great oak-tree by that stream-side which ran through the Mote-stead;\r\nthere also was Folk-might, somewhat distraught because of his love for\r\nthe Bride, who was now mending of her hurts.  As they sat there in all\r\ncontent they saw folk coming toward them, three in number, and as they\r\ndrew nigher they saw that it was old Hall-ward of the Steer, and the\r\nSun-beam and Bow-may following him hand in hand.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the brook Bow-may ran up to the elder to help him over\r\nthe stepping-stones; which she did as one who loved him, as the old man\r\nwas stark enough to have waded the water waist-deep.  She was no longer\r\nin her war-gear, but was clad after her wont of Shadowy Vale, in nought\r\nbut a white woollen kirtle.  So she stood in the stream beside the\r\nstones, and let the swift water ripple up over her ankles, while the\r\nelder leaned on her shoulder and looked down upon her kindly.  The\r\nSun-beam followed after them, stepping daintily from stone to stone, so\r\nthat she was a fair sight to see; her face was smiling and happy, and as\r\nshe stepped forth on to the green grass the colour flushed up in it, but\r\nshe cast her eyes adown as one somewhat shamefaced.\r\n\r\nSo the chieftains rose up before the leader of the Steer, and Folk-might\r\nwent up to him, and greeted him, and took his hand and kissed him on the\r\ncheek.  And Hall-ward said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hail to the chiefs of the kindred, and my earthly friends!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Folk-might bade him sit down by him, and all the men sat down again;\r\nbut the Sun-beam leaned her back against a sapling ash hard by, her feet\r\nset close together; and Bow-may went to and fro in short turns, keeping\r\nwell within ear-shot.\r\n\r\nThen said Hall-ward: \xe2\x80\x98Folk-might, I have prayed thy kinswoman Bow-may to\r\nlead me to thee, that I might speak with thee; and it is good that I find\r\nmy kinsmen of the Face in thy company; for I would say a word to thee\r\nthat concerns them somewhat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Guest, and warrior of the Steer, thy words are ever\r\ngood; and if this time thou comest to ask aught of me, then shall they be\r\nbetter than good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Hall-ward: \xe2\x80\x98Tell me, Folk-might, hast thou seen my daughter the\r\nBride to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, reddening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What didst thou deem of her state?\xe2\x80\x99 said Hall-ward.\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Thou knowest thyself that the fever hath left her, and\r\nthat she is mending.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHall-ward said: \xe2\x80\x98In a few days belike we shall be wending home to\r\nBurgdale: when deemest thou that the Bride may travel, if it were but on\r\na litter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFolk-might was silent, and Hall-ward smiled on him and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wouldst thou have her tarry, O chief of the Wolf?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98that it might be labour lost for her to\r\njourney to Burgdale at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thinkest thou?\xe2\x80\x99 said Hall-ward; \xe2\x80\x98hast thou a mind then that if she goeth\r\nshe shall speedily come back hither?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has been in my mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98that I should wed her.  Wilt\r\nthou gainsay it?  I pray thee, Iron-face my friend, and ye Stone-face and\r\nHall-face, and thou, Face-of-god, my brother, to lay thy words to mine in\r\nthis matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen said Hall-ward stroking his beard: \xe2\x80\x98There will be a seat missing in\r\nthe Hall of the Steer, and a sore lack in the heart of many a man in\r\nBurgdale if the Bride come back to us no more.  We looked not to lose the\r\nmaiden by her wedding; for it is no long way betwixt the House of the\r\nSteer and the House of the Face.  But now, when I arise in the morning\r\nand miss her, I shall take my staff and walk down the street of\r\nBurgstead; for I shall say, The Maiden hath gone to see Iron-face my\r\nfriend; she is well in the House of the Face.  And then shall I remember\r\nhow that the wood and the wastes lie between us.  How sayest thou,\r\nAlderman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A sore lack it will be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face; \xe2\x80\x98but all good go with her!\r\nThough whiles shall I go hatless down Burgstead street, and say, Now will\r\nI go fetch my daughter the Bride from the House of the Steer; while many\r\na day\xe2\x80\x99s journey shall lie betwixt us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Hall-ward: \xe2\x80\x98I will not beat about the bush, Folk-might; what gift\r\nwilt thou give us for the maiden?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98Whatever is mine shall be thine; and whatsoever of the\r\nDale the kindred and the poor folk begrudge thee not, that shalt thou\r\nhave; and deemest thou that they will begrudge thee aught?  Is it\r\nenough?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHall-ward said: \xe2\x80\x98I wot not, chieftain; see thou to it!  Bow-may, my\r\nfriend, bring hither that which I would have from Silver-dale for the\r\nHouse of the Steer in payment for our maiden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Bow-may came forward speedily, and went up to the Sun-beam, and led\r\nher by the hand in front of Folk-might and Hall-ward and the other\r\nchieftains.  Then Folk-might started, and leapt up from the ground; for,\r\nsooth to say, he had been thinking so wholly of the Bride, that his\r\nsister was not in his mind, and he had had no deeming of whither\r\nHall-ward was coming, though the others guessed well enough, and now\r\nsmiled on him merrily, when they saw how wild Folk-might stared.  As for\r\nthe Sun-beam, she stood there blushing like a rose in June, but looking\r\nher brother straight in the face, as Hall-ward said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Folk-might, chief of the Wolf, since thou wouldst take our maiden the\r\nBride away from us, I ask thee to make good her place with this maiden;\r\nso that the House of the Steer may not lack, when they who are wont to\r\nwed therein come to us and pray us for a bedfellow for the best of their\r\nkindred.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen became Folk-might smiling and merry like unto the others, and he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Chief of the Steer, this gift is thine, together with aught else\r\nwhich thou mayst desire of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he kissed the Sun-beam, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Sister, we looked for this to\r\nbefall in some fashion.  Yet we deemed that he that should lead thee away\r\nmight abide with us for a moon or two.  But now let all this be, since if\r\nthou art not to bear children to the kindreds of Silver-dale, yet shalt\r\nthou bear them to their friends and fellows.  And now choose what gift\r\nthou wilt have of us to keep us in thy memory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x98The memory of my people shall not fade from me; yet indeed I\r\nask thee for a gift, to wit, Bow-may, and the two sons of Wood-father\r\nthat are left since Wood-wicked was slain; and belike the elder and his\r\nwife will be fain to go with their sons, and ye will not hinder them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even so shall it be done,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, and he was silent a while,\r\npondering; and then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lo you, friends! doth it not seem strange to you that peace sundereth as\r\nwell as war?  Indeed I deem it grievous that ye shall have to miss your\r\nwell-beloved kinswoman.  And for me, I am now grown so used to this woman\r\nmy sister, though at whiles she hath been masterful with me, that I shall\r\noften turn about and think to speak to her, when there lie long days of\r\nwood and waste betwixt her voice and mine.\r\n\r\nThe Sun-beam laughed in his face, though the tears stood in her eyes, as\r\nshe said: \xe2\x80\x98Keep up thine heart, brother; for at least the way is shorter\r\nbetwixt Burgdale and Silver-dale than betwixt life and death; and the\r\nroad we shall learn belike.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Hall-face: \xe2\x80\x98So it is that my brother is no ill woodman, as ye\r\nlearned last autumn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIron-face smiled, but somewhat sadly; for he beheld Face-of-god, who had\r\nno eyes for anyone save the Sun-beam; and no marvel was that, for never\r\nhad she looked fairer.  And forsooth the War-leader was not utterly\r\nwell-pleased; for he was deeming that there would be delaying of his\r\nwedding, now that the Sun-beam was to become a maid of the Steer; and in\r\nhis mind he half deemed that it would be better if he were to take her by\r\nthe hand and lead her home through the wild-wood, he and she alone; and\r\nshe looked on him shyly, as though she had a deeming of his thought.\r\nAlbeit he knew it might not be, that he, the chosen War-leader, should\r\ntrouble the peace of the kindred; for he wotted that all this was done\r\nfor peace\xe2\x80\x99 sake.\r\n\r\nSo Hall-ward stood forth and took the Sun-beam\xe2\x80\x99s right hand in his, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now do I take this maiden, Sun-beam of the kindred of the Wolf, and lead\r\nher into the House of the Steer, to be in all ways one of the maidens of\r\nour House, and to wed in the blood wherein we have been wont to wed.\r\nNeither from henceforth let anyone say that this woman is not of the\r\nblood of the Steer; for we have given her our blood, and she is of us\r\nduly and truly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereafter they talked together merrily for a little, and then turned\r\ntoward the houses, for the sun was now down; and as they went Iron-face\r\nspake to his son, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, wilt thou verily keep thine oath to wed the fairest woman in\r\nthe world?  By how much is this one fairer than my dear daughter who\r\nshall no more dwell in mine house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, father, I shall keep mine oath; for the Gods, who\r\nknow much, know that when I swore last Yule I was thinking of the fair\r\nwoman going yonder beside Hall-ward, and of none other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, son!\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron-face, \xe2\x80\x98why didst thou beguile us?  Hadst thou but\r\ntold us the truth then!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, Alderman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god smiling, \xe2\x80\x98and how thou wouldest have\r\nraged against me then, when thou hast scarce forgiven me now!  In sooth,\r\nfather, I feared to tell you all: I was young; I was one against the\r\nworld.  Yea, yea; and even that was sweet to me, so sorely as I loved\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94Hast thou forgotten, father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIron-face smiled, and answered not; and so came they to the house wherein\r\nthey were guested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.  TIDINGS OF DALLACH: A FOLK-MOTE IN SILVER-DALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE days thereafter came two swift runners from Rose-dale with tidings\r\nof Dallach.  In all wise had he thriven, and had slain many of the\r\nrunaways, and had come happily to Rose-dale: therein by the mere shaking\r\nof their swords had they all their will; for there were but a few of the\r\nDusky Warriors in the Dale, since the more part had fared to the\r\nslaughter in Silver-stead.  Now therefore had Dallach been made Alderman\r\nof Rose-dale; and the Burgdalers who had gone with him should abide the\r\ncoming thither of the rest of the Burgdale Host, and meantime of their\r\ncoming should uphold the new Alderman in Rose-dale.  Howbeit Dallach sent\r\nword that it was not to be doubted but that many of the Dusky Men had\r\nescaped to the woods, and should yet be the death of many a mother\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\nunless it were well looked to.\r\n\r\nAnd now the more part of the Burgdale men and the Shepherds began to look\r\ntoward home, albeit some amongst them had not been ill-pleased to abide\r\nthere yet a while; for life was exceeding soft to them there, though they\r\nhelped the poor folk gladly in their husbandry.  For especially the women\r\nof the Dale, of whom many were very goodly, hankered after the fair-faced\r\ntall Burgdalers, and were as kind to them as might be.  Forsooth not a\r\nfew, both carles and queens, of the old thrall-folk prayed them of\r\nBurgdale to take them home thither, that they might see new things and\r\nforget their old torments once for all, yea, even in dreams.  The\r\nBurgdalers would not gainsay them, and there was no one else to hinder;\r\nso that there went with the Burgdale men at their departure hard on five\r\nscore of the Silver-dale folk who were not of the kindreds.\r\n\r\nAnd now was a great Folk-mote holden in Silver-dale, whereto the Burgdale\r\nmen and the Shepherds were bidden; and thereat the War-leader gave out\r\nthe morrow of the morrow for the day of the departure of the Host.  There\r\nalso were the matters of Silver-dale duly ordered: the Men of the Wolf\r\nwould have had the Woodlanders dwell with them in the fair-builded stead,\r\nand take to them of the goodly stone houses there what they would; but\r\nthis they naysaid, choosing rather to dwell in scattered houses, which\r\nthey built for themselves at the utmost limit of the tillage.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the most abode not even there a long while; for they loved the\r\nwood and its deeds.  So they went forth into the wood, and cleared them\r\nspace to dwell in, and builded them halls such as they loved, and fell to\r\ntheir old woodland crafts of charcoal-burning and hunting, wherein they\r\nthrove well.  And good for Silver-dale was their abiding there, since\r\nthey became a sure defence and stout outpost against all foemen.  For the\r\nrest, wheresoever they dwelt, they were guest-cherishing and blithe, and\r\nwere well beloved by all people; and they wedded with the other Houses of\r\nthe Children of the Wolf.\r\n\r\nAs to the other matters whereof they took rede at this Folk-mote, they\r\nhad mostly to do with the warding of the Dale, and the learning of the\r\ndelivered thralls to handle weapons duly.  For men deemed it most like\r\nthat they would have to meet other men of the kindred of the Felons;\r\nwhich indeed fell out as the years wore.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Folk-might (by the rede of Stone-face) sent messengers to the\r\nPlain and the Cities, unto men whom he knew there, doing them to wit of\r\nthe tidings of Silver-dale, and how that a peaceful and guest-loving\r\npeople, having good store of wares, now dwelt therein, so that chapmen\r\nmight have recourse thither.\r\n\r\nLastly spake Folk-might and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guests and brothers-in-arms, we have been looking about our new house,\r\nwhich was our old one, and therein we find great store of wares which we\r\nneed not, and which we can but use if ye use them.  Of your kindness\r\ntherefore we pray you to take of those things what ye can easily carry.\r\nAnd if ye say the way is long, as indeed it is, since ye are bent on\r\ngoing through the wood to Rose-dale, and so on to Burgdale, yet shall we\r\nfurnish you with beasts to bear your goods, and with such wains as may\r\npass through the woodland ways.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen rose up Fox of Upton and said: \xe2\x80\x98O Folk-might, and ye men of the\r\nWolf, be it known unto you, that if we have done anything for your help\r\nin the winning of Silver-dale, we have thus done that we might help\r\nourselves also, so that we might live in peace henceforward, and that we\r\nmight have your friendship and fellowship therewithal, so that here in\r\nSilver-dale might wax a mighty folk who joined unto us should be strong\r\nenough to face the whole world.  Such are the redes of wise men when they\r\ngo a-warring.  But we have no will to go back home again made rich with\r\nyour wealth; this hath been far from our thought in this matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd there went up a murmur from all the Burgdalers yeasaying his word.\r\n\r\nBut Folk-might took up the word again and spake:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, what ye say is both manly and\r\nfriendly; yet, since we look to see a road made plain through the\r\nwoodland betwixt Burgdale and Silver-dale, and that often ye shall face\r\nus in the feast-hall, and whiles stand beside us in the fray, we must\r\nneeds pray you not to shame us by departing empty-handed; for how then\r\nmay we look upon your faces again?  Stone-face, my friend, thou art old\r\nand wise; therefore I bid thee to help us herein, and speak for us to thy\r\nkindred, that they naysay us not in this matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen stood up Stone-face and said: \xe2\x80\x98Forsooth, friends, Folk-might is in\r\nthe right herein; for he may look for anger from the wights that come and\r\ngo betwixt his kindred and the Gods, if they see us faring back giftless\r\nthrough the woods.  Moreover, now that ye have seen Silver-dale, ye may\r\nwot how rich a land it is of all good things, and able to bring forth\r\nenough and to spare.  And now meseemeth the Gods love this Folk that\r\nshall dwell here; and they shall become a mighty Folk, and a part of our\r\nvery selves.  Therefore let us take the gifts of our friends, and thank\r\nthem blithely.  For surely, as saith Folk-might, henceforth the wood\r\nshall become a road betwixt us, and the thicket a halting-place for\r\nfriends bearing goodwill in their hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he had spoken, men yeasaid his words and forbore the gifts no\r\nlonger; and the Folk-mote sundered in all loving-kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.  DEPARTURE FROM SILVER-DALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nON morrow of the morrow were the Burgdale men and they of the Shepherds\r\ngathered together in the Market-stead early in the morning, and they were\r\nall ready for departure; and the men of the Wolf and the Woodlanders, and\r\nof the delivered thralls a great many, stood round about them grieving\r\nthat they must go.  There was much talk between the folk of the Dale and\r\nthe Guests, and many promises were given and taken to come and go betwixt\r\nthe two Dales.  There also were the men of the thrall-folk who were to\r\nwend home with the Burgdalers; and they had been stuffed with good things\r\nby the men of the kindreds, and were as fain as might be.\r\n\r\nAs for the Sun-beam, she was somewhat out of herself at first, being\r\neager and restless beyond her wont, and yet at whiles weeping-ripe when\r\nshe called to mind that she was now leaving all those things, the gain\r\nwhereof had been a dream to her both waking and sleeping for these years\r\npast.  But at last, as she stood in the door of the Mote-house, and\r\nbeheld all the throng of folk happy and friendly, it came over her that\r\nshe herself had done her full share to bring all this about, and that all\r\nthose pleasant places of Silver-dale now full of the goodly life of man\r\nwould be there even as she had striven for them, and that they would be a\r\npart of her left behind, though she were dwelling otherwhere.\r\n\r\nTherewithal she said to herself that it was now her part to wield the\r\nlife of men in Burgdale, and begin once more her days of a chieftain and\r\na swayer of the Folk, and the life of a stirring woman, which the edge of\r\nthe sword and the need of the hard hand-play had taken out of her hands\r\nfor a while, making her as a child in the hands of the strong wielders of\r\nthe blades.\r\n\r\nSo now she became calm once more, and her face was clad again with the\r\nfull measure of that majesty of beauty which had once overawed\r\nFace-of-god amidst his love of her; and folk beheld her and marvelled at\r\nher fairness, and said: \xe2\x80\x98She hath an inward sorrow at leaving the fair\r\nDale wherein her Fathers dwelt, and where her mother\xe2\x80\x99s ashes lie in\r\nearth.\xe2\x80\x99  Albeit now was her sorrow but little, and much was her hope, and\r\nher foresight of days to be; though all the Dale, yea, every leaf and\r\ntwig of it whereby her feet had ever passed, and each stone of the fair\r\nhouses, was to her as a picture that she could look on from henceforth\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nOf the Bride it is to be said that she was now much mended, and she\r\ncaused men bear her on a litter out into the Marketplace, that she might\r\nlook on the departure of her folk.  She had seen Face-of-god once and\r\nagain since the Day of Battle, and each time had been kind and blithe\r\nwith him; and for Iron-face, she loved him so well that she was ever loth\r\nto let him depart from her, save when Folk-might was with her.\r\n\r\nAnd now was the Alderman standing beside her, and she said to him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friend and kinsman, this is the day of departure, and though I must\r\nneeds abide behind, and am content to abide, yet doth mine heart ache\r\nwith the sundering; for to-morrow when I wake in the morning there will\r\nbe no more sending of a messenger to fetch thee to me.  Indeed, great\r\nhath been the love between me and my people, and nought hath come between\r\nus to mar it.  Now, kinsman, I would see Gold-mane, my cousin, that I may\r\nbid him farewell; for who knoweth if I shall see him again hereafter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen went Iron-face and found Face-of-god where he was speaking with\r\nFolk-might and the chieftains, and said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come quickly, for thy cousin the Bride would speak with thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFace-of-god reddened, and paled afterwards, but he went along with his\r\nfather silently; and his heart beat as he came and stood before the\r\nlitter whereas the Bride lay, clad all in white and propped up on fair\r\ncushions of red silk.  She was frail to look on, and worn and pale yet;\r\nbut he deemed that she was very happy.\r\n\r\nShe smiled on him, and reached out her hand and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Welcome once more, cousin!\xe2\x80\x99  And he held her hand and kissed it, and was\r\nnigh weeping, so sore was he beset by a throng of memories concerning her\r\nand him in the days when they were little; and he bethought him of her\r\nloving-kindness of past days, beyond that of most children, beyond that\r\nof most maidens; and how there was nothing in his life but she had a\r\nshare in it, till the day when he found the Hall on the Mountain.\r\n\r\nSo he said to her: \xe2\x80\x98Kinswoman, is it well with thee?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I am now nigh whole of my hurts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was silent a while; then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And otherwise art thou merry at heart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98yet thou wilt not find it hard to deem that I\r\nam sorry of the sundering betwixt me and Burgdale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain was he silent, and said in a while: \xe2\x80\x98Dost thou deem that I wrought\r\nthat sundering?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe smiled kindly on him and said: \xe2\x80\x98Gold-mane, my playmate, thou art\r\nbecome a mighty warrior and a great chief; but thou art not so mighty as\r\nthat.  Many things lay behind the sundering which were neither thou nor\r\nI.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98it was but such a little time agone that all things\r\nseemed so sure; and we\xe2\x80\x94to both of us was the outlook happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let it be happy still,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98now begrudging is gone.  Belike the\r\nsundering came because we were so sure, and had no defence against the\r\nwearing of the days; even as it fareth with a folk that hath no foes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe smiled and said: \xe2\x80\x98Even as it hath befallen _thy_ folk, O Bride, a\r\nwhile ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe reddened, and reached her hand to him, and he took it and held it,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Shall I see thee again as the days wear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid she: \xe2\x80\x98O chieftain of the Folk, thou shalt have much to do in\r\nBurgdale, and the way is long.  Yet would I have thee see my children.\r\nForget not the token on my hand which thou holdest.  But now get thee to\r\nthy folk with no more words; for after all, playmate, the sundering is\r\ngrievous to me, and I would not spin out the time thereof.  Farewell!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but stooped down and kissed her lips, and then turned\r\nfrom her, and took his ways to the head of the Host, and fell to asking\r\nand answering, and bidding and arraying; and in a little time was his\r\nheart dancing with joy to think of the days that lay before him, wherein\r\nnow all seemed happy.\r\n\r\nSo was all arrayed for departure when it lacked three hours of noon.  As\r\nFolk-might had promised, there were certain light wains drawn by bullocks\r\nabiding the departure of the Host, and of sumpter bullocks and horses no\r\nfew; and all these were laden with fair gifts of the Dale, as silver, and\r\nraiment, and weapons.  There were many things fair-wrought in the time of\r\nthe Sorrow, that henceforth should see but little sorrow.  Moreover,\r\nthere was plenty of provision for the way, both meal and wine, and sheep\r\nand neat; and all things as fair as might be, and well-arrayed.\r\n\r\nIt was the Shepherds who were to lead the way; and after them were\r\narrayed the men of the Vine and the Sickle; then they of the Steer, the\r\nBridge, and the Bull; and lastly the House of the Face, with old\r\nStone-face leading them.  The Sun-beam was to journey along with the\r\nHouse of the Steer, which had taken her in as a maiden of their blood;\r\nand though she had so much liefer have fared with the House of the Face,\r\nyet she went meekly as she was bidden, as one who has gotten a great\r\nthing, and will make no stir about a small one.\r\n\r\nAlong with her were Wood-father and Wood-mother, and Wood-wise, now whole\r\nof his hurt, and Wood-wont, and Bow-may.  Save Bow-may, they were not\r\nvery joyous; for they were fain of Silver-dale, and it irked them to\r\nleave it; moreover, they also had liefer have gone along with the House\r\nof the War-leader.\r\n\r\nLast of all went those people of the once thralls of the Dusky Men who\r\nhad cast in their lot with the Burgdalers, and they were exceeding merry;\r\nand especially the women of them, they were chattering like the stares in\r\nthe autumn evening, when they gather from the fields in the tall\r\nelm-trees before they go to roost.\r\n\r\nNow all the men of the Dale, both of the kindreds and of the thrall-folk,\r\nmade way for the Host and its havings, that they might go their ways down\r\nthe Dale; albeit the Woodlanders clung close to the line of their ancient\r\nfriends, and with them, as men who were sorry for the sundering, were\r\nWolf-stone and God-swain and Spear-fist.  But the chiefs, they drew\r\naround Folk-might a little beside the way.\r\n\r\nNow Red-coat of Waterless, who had been hurt, and was now whole again,\r\ncast his arms about Folk-might and kissed him, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All the way hence to Burgdale will I sow with good wishes for thee and\r\nthine, and especially for my dear friend God-swain of the Silver Arm; and\r\nI would wish and long that they might turn into spells to draw thy feet\r\nto usward; for we love thee well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn like wise spake other of the Burgdalers; and Folk-might was kind and\r\nblithe with them, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Friends, forget ye not that the way is no longer from you to us than it\r\nis from us to you.  One half of this matter it is for you to deal with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True is that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Red-beard of the Knolls, \xe2\x80\x98but look you, Folk-might,\r\nwe be but simple husbandmen, and may not often stir from our meadows and\r\nacres; even now I bethink me that May is amidst us, and I am beginning to\r\nbe drawn by the thought of the haysel.  Whereas thou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 (and therewith he\r\nreddened) \xe2\x80\x98I doubt that thou hast little to do save the work of\r\nchieftains, and we know that such work is but little missed if it be\r\nundone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereat Folk-might laughed; and when the others saw that he laughed, they\r\nlaughed also, else had they foreborne for courtesy\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nBut Folk-might answered: \xe2\x80\x98Nay, chief of the Sickle, I am not altogether a\r\nchieftain, now we have gotten us peace; and somewhat of a husbandman\r\nshall I be.  Moreover, doubt ye not that I shall do my utmost to behold\r\nthe fair Dale again; for it is but mountains that meet not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow spake Face-of-god to Folk-might, smiling and somewhat softly, and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Is all forgiven now, since the day when we first felt each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea, all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might; \xe2\x80\x98now hath befallen what I foretold thee in\r\nShadowy Vale, that thou mightest pay for all that had come and gone, if\r\nthou wouldest but look to it.  Indeed thou wert angry with me for that\r\nsaying on that eve of Shadowy Vale; but see thou, in those days I was an\r\nolder man than thou, and might admonish thee somewhat; but now, though\r\nbut few days have gone over thine head, yet many deeds have abided in\r\nthine hand, and thou art much aged.  Anger hath left thee, and wisdom\r\nhath waxed in thee.  As for me, I may now say this word: May the Folk of\r\nBurgdale love the Folk of Silver-dale as well as I love thee; then shall\r\nall be well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Face-of-god cast his arms about him and kissed him, and turned away\r\ntoward Stone-face and Hall-face his brother, where they stood at the head\r\nof the array of the Face; and even therewith came up the Alderman\r\nsomewhat sad and sober of countenance, and he pushed by the War-leader\r\nroughly and would not speak with him.\r\n\r\nAnd now blew up the horns of the Shepherds, and they began to move on\r\namidst the shouting of the men of Silver-dale; yet were there amongst the\r\nWoodlanders those who wept when they saw their friends verily departing\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nBut when they of the foremost of the Host were gotten so far forward that\r\nthe men of the Face could begin to move, lo! there was Redesman with his\r\nfiddle amongst the leaders; and he had done a man\xe2\x80\x99s work in the day of\r\nbattle, and all looked kindly on him.  About him on this morn were some\r\nwho had learned the craft of singing well together, and knew his\r\nminstrelsy, and he turned to these and nodded as their array moved on,\r\nand he drew his bow across the strings, and straightway they fell\r\na-singing, even as it might be thus:\r\n\r\n   Back again to the dear Dale where born was the kindred,\r\n      Here wend we all living, and liveth our mirth.\r\n   Here afoot fares our joyance, whatever men hindred,\r\n      Through all wrath of the heavens, all storms of the earth.\r\n\r\n   O true, we have left here a part of our treasure,\r\n      The ashes of stout ones, the stems of the shield;\r\n   But the bold lives they spended have sown us new pleasure,\r\n      Fair tales for the telling in fold and on field.\r\n\r\n   For as oft as we sing of their edges\xe2\x80\x99 upheaving,\r\n      When the yellowing windows shine forth o\xe2\x80\x99er the night,\r\n   Their names unforgotten with song interweaving\r\n      Shall draw forth dear drops from the depths of delight.\r\n\r\n   Or when down by our feet the grey sickles are lying,\r\n      And behind us is curling the supper-tide smoke,\r\n   No whit shall they grudge us the joyance undying,\r\n      Remembrance of men that put from us the yoke.\r\n\r\n   When the huddle of ewes from the fells we have driven,\r\n      And we see down the Dale the grey reach of the roof,\r\n   We shall tell of the gift in the battle-joy given,\r\n      All the fierceness of friends that drave sorrow aloof.\r\n\r\n   Once then we lamented, and mourned them departed;\r\n      Once only, no oftener.  Henceforth shall we fling\r\n   Their names up aloft, when the merriest hearted\r\n      To the Fathers unseen of our life-days we sing.\r\n\r\nThen was there silence in the ranks of men; and many murmured the names\r\nof the fallen as they fared on their way from out the Market-place of\r\nSilver-stead.  Then once more Redesman and his mates took up the song:\r\n\r\n   Come tell me, O friends, for whom bideth the maiden\r\n      Wet-foot from the river-ford down in the Dale?\r\n   For whom hath the goodwife the ox-waggon laden\r\n      With the babble of children, brown-handed and hale?\r\n\r\n   Come tell me for what are the women abiding,\r\n      Till each on the other aweary they lean?\r\n   Is it loitering of evil that thus they are chiding,\r\n      The slow-footed bearers of sorrow unseen?\r\n\r\n   Nay, yet were they toiling if sorrow had worn them,\r\n      Or hushed had they bided with lips parched and wan.\r\n   The birds of the air other tidings have borne them\xe2\x80\x94\r\n      How glad through the wood goeth man beside man.\r\n\r\n   Then fare forth, O valiant, and loiter no longer\r\n      Than the cry of the cuckoo when May is at hand;\r\n   Late waxeth the spring-tide, and daylight grows longer,\r\n      And nightly the star-street hangs high o\xe2\x80\x99er the land.\r\n\r\n   Many lives, many days for the Dale do ye carry;\r\n      When the Host breaketh out from the thicket unshorn,\r\n   It shall be as the sun that refuseth to tarry\r\n      On the crown of all mornings, the Midsummer morn.\r\n\r\nAgain the song fell down till they were well on the western way down\r\nSilver-dale; and then Redesman handled his fiddle once more, and again\r\nthe song rose up, and such-like were the words which were borne back into\r\nthe Market-place of Silver-stead:\r\n\r\n   And yet what is this, and why fare ye so slowly,\r\n      While our echoing halls of our voices are dumb,\r\n   And abideth unlitten the hearth-brand the holy,\r\n      And the feet of the kind fare afield till we come?\r\n\r\n   For not yet through the wood and its tangle ye wander;\r\n      Now skirt we no thicket, no path by the mere;\r\n   Far aloof for our feet leads the Dale-road out yonder;\r\n      Full fair is the morning, its doings all clear.\r\n\r\n   There is nought now our feet on the highway delaying\r\n      Save the friend\xe2\x80\x99s loving-kindness, the sundering of speech;\r\n   The well-willer\xe2\x80\x99s word that ends words with the saying,\r\n      The loth to depart while each looketh on each.\r\n\r\n   Fare on then, for nought are ye laden with sorrow;\r\n      The love of this land do ye bear with you still.\r\n   In two Dales of the earth for to-day and to-morrow\r\n      Is waxing the oak-tree of peace and good-will.\r\n\r\nThus then they departed from Silver-dale, even as men who were a portion\r\nthereof, and had not utterly left it behind.  And that night they lay in\r\nthe wild-wood not very far from the Dale\xe2\x80\x99s end; for they went softly,\r\nfaring amongst so many friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.  TALK UPON THE WILD-WOOD WAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nON the morrow morning when they were on their way again Face-of-god left\r\nhis own folk to go with the House of the Steer a while; and amongst them\r\nhe fell in with the Sun-beam going along with Bow-may.  So they greeted\r\nhim kindly, and Face-of-god fell into talk with the Sun-beam as they went\r\nside by side through a great oak-wood, where for a space was plain\r\ngreen-sward bare of all underwood.\r\n\r\nSo in their talk he said to her: \xe2\x80\x98What deemest thou, my speech-friend,\r\nconcerning our coming back to guest in Silver-dale one day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The way is long,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That may hinder us but not stay us,\xe2\x80\x99 said Face-of-god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is sooth,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Sun-beam.\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98What things shall stay us?  Or deemest thou that we\r\nshall never see Silver-dale again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe smiled: \xe2\x80\x98Even so I think thou deemest, Gold-mane.  But many things\r\nshall hinder us besides the long road.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid he: \xe2\x80\x98Yea, and what things?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thinkest thou,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Sun-beam, \xe2\x80\x98that the winning of Silver-stead is\r\nthe last battle which thou shalt see?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98nay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall thy Dale\xe2\x80\x94our Dale\xe2\x80\x94be free from all trouble within itself\r\nhenceforward?  Is there a wall built round it to keep out for ever storm,\r\npestilence, and famine, and the waywardness of its own folk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is as thou sayest,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Face-of-god, \xe2\x80\x98and to meet such troubles\r\nand overcome them, or to die in strife with them, this is a great part of\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and hast thou forgotten that thou art now a great\r\nchieftain, and that the folk shall look to thee to use thee many days in\r\nthe year?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98So it is.  How many days have gone by since I\r\nwandered in the wood last autumn, that the world should have changed so\r\nmuch!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many deeds shall now be in thy days,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and each deed as the\r\ncorn of wheat from which cometh many corns; and a man\xe2\x80\x99s days on the earth\r\nare not over many.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then farewell, Silver-dale!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, waving his hand toward the north.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98War and trouble may bring me back to thee, but it maybe nought else\r\nshall.  Farewell!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked on him fondly but unsmiling, as he went beside her strong and\r\nwarrior-like.  Three paces from him went Bow-may, barefoot, in her white\r\nkirtle, but bearing her bow in her hand; a leash of arrows was in her\r\ngirdle, her quiver hung at her back, and she was girt with a sword.  On\r\nthe other side went Wood-wont and Wood-wise, lightly clad but weaponed.\r\nWood-mother was riding in an ox-wain just behind them, and Wood-father\r\nwent beside her bearing an axe.  Scattered all about them were the men of\r\nthe Steer, gaily clad, bearing weapons, so that the oak-wood was bright\r\nwith them, and the glades merry with their talk and singing and laughter,\r\nand before them down the glades went the banner of the Steer, and the\r\nWhite Beast led them the nearest way to Burgdale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.  HOW THE HOST CAME HOME AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was fourteen days before they came to Rose-dale; for they had much\r\nbaggage with them, and they had no mind to weary themselves, and the wood\r\nwas nothing loathsome to them, whereas the weather was fair and bright\r\nfor the more part.  They fell in with no mishap by the way.  But a score\r\nand three of runaways joined themselves to the Host, having watched their\r\ngoings and wotting that they were not foemen.  Of these, some had heard\r\nof the overthrow of the Dusky Men in Silver-dale, and others not.  The\r\nBurgdalers received them all, for it seemed to them no great matter for a\r\nscore or so of new-comers to the Dale.\r\n\r\nBut when the Host was come to Rose-dale, they found it fair arid lovely;\r\nand there they met with those of their folk who had gone with Dallach.\r\nBut Dallach welcomed the kindreds with great joy, and bade them abide;\r\nfor he said that they had the less need to hasten, since he had sent\r\nmessengers into Burgdale to tell men there of the tidings.  Albeit they\r\nwere mostly loth to tarry; yet when he lay hard on them not to depart as\r\nmen on the morrow of a gild-feast, they abode there three days, and were\r\nas well guested as might be, and on their departure they were laden with\r\ngifts from the wealth of Rose-dale by Dallach and his folk.\r\n\r\nBefore they went their ways Dallach spake with Face-of-god and the chiefs\r\nof the Dalesmen, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye have given me much from the time when ye found me in the wood a naked\r\nwastrel; yet now I would ask you a gift to lay on the top of all that ye\r\nhave given me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Name the gift, and thou shalt have it; for we deem\r\nthee our friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am no less,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dallach, \xe2\x80\x98as in time to come I may perchance be able\r\nto show you.  But now I am asking you to suffer a score or two of your\r\nmen to abide here with me this summer, till I see how this folk new-born\r\nagain is like to deal with me.  For pleasure and a fair life have become\r\nso strange to them, that they scarce know what to do with them, or how to\r\nlive; and unless all is to go awry, I must needs command and forbid; and\r\nthough belike they love me, yet they fear me not; so that when my\r\ncommandment pleaseth them, they do as I bid, and when it pleaseth them\r\nnot, they do contrary to my bidding; for it hath got into their minds\r\nthat I shall in no case lift a hand against them, which indeed is the\r\nvery sooth.  But your folk they fear as warriors of the world, who have\r\nslain the Dusky Men in the Market-place of Silver-stead; and they are of\r\nalien blood to them, men who will do as their friend biddeth (think our\r\nfolk) against them who are neither friends or foes.  With such help I\r\nshall be well holpen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn such wise spake Dallach; and Face-of-god and the chiefs said that so\r\nit should be, if men could be found willing to abide in Rose-dale for a\r\nwhile.  And when the matter was put abroad, there was no lack of such men\r\namongst the younger warriors, who had noted that the dale was fair\r\namongst dales and its women fairer yet amongst women.\r\n\r\nSo two score and ten of the Burgdale men abode in Rose-dale, no one of\r\nwhom was of more than twenty and five winters.  Forsooth divers of them\r\nset up house in Rose-dale, and never came back to Burgdale, save as\r\nguests.  For a half score were wedded in Rose-dale before the year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nending; and seven more, who had also taken to them wives of the goodliest\r\nof the Rose-dale women, betook them the next spring to the Burg of the\r\nRunaways, and there built them a stead, and drew a garth about it, and\r\ndug and sowed the banks of the river, which they called Inglebourne.  And\r\nas years passed, this same stead throve exceedingly, and men resorted\r\nthither both from Rose-dale and Burgdale; for it was a pleasant place;\r\nand the land, when it was cured, was sweet and good, and the wood\r\nthereabout was full of deer of all kinds.  So their stead was called\r\nInglebourne after the stream; and in latter days it became a very goodly\r\nhabitation of men.\r\n\r\nMoreover, some of the once-enthralled folk of Rose-dale, when they knew\r\nthat men of their kindred from Silver-dale were going home with the men\r\nof Burgdale to dwell in the Dale, prayed hard to go along with them; for\r\nthey looked on the Burgdalers as if they were new Gods of the Earth.  The\r\nBurgdale chiefs would not gainsay these men either, but took with them\r\nthree score and ten from Rose-dale, men and women, and promised them\r\ndwelling and livelihood in Burgdale.\r\n\r\nSo now with good hearts the Host of Burgdale turned their faces toward\r\ntheir well-beloved Dale; and they made good diligence, so that in three\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 time they were come anigh the edge of the woodland wilderness.\r\nThither in the even-tide, as they were making ready for their last supper\r\nand bed in the wood, came three men and two women of their folk, who had\r\nbeen abiding their coming ever since they had had the tidings of\r\nSilver-dale and the battles from Dallach.  Great was the joy of these\r\nmessengers as they went from company to company of the warriors, and saw\r\nthe familiar faces of their friends, and heard their wonted voices\r\ntelling all the story of battle and slaughter.  And for their part the\r\nmen of the Host feasted these stay-at-homes, and made much of them.  But\r\none of them, a man of the House of the Face, left the Host a little after\r\nnightfall, and bore back to Burgstead at once the tidings of the coming\r\nhome of the Host.  Albeit since Dallach\xe2\x80\x99s tidings of victory had come to\r\nthe Dale, the dwellers in the steads of the country-side had left\r\nBurgstead and gone home to their own houses; so that there was no great\r\nmultitude abiding in the Thorp.\r\n\r\nSo early on the morrow was the Host astir; but ere they came to\r\nWildlake\xe2\x80\x99s Way, the Shepherd-folk turned aside westward to go home, after\r\nthey had bidden farewell to their friends and fellows of the Dale; for\r\ntheir souls longed for the sheepcotes in the winding valleys under the\r\nlong grey downs; and the garths where the last year\xe2\x80\x99s ricks shouldered up\r\nagainst the old stone gables, and where the daws were busy in the tall\r\nunfrequent ash-trees; and the green flowery meadows adown along the\r\nbright streams, where the crowfoot and the paigles were blooming now, and\r\nthe harebells were in flower about the thorn-bushes at the down\xe2\x80\x99s foot,\r\nwhence went the savour of their blossom over sheep-walk and water-meadow.\r\n\r\nSo these went their ways with many kind words; and two hours afterwards\r\nall the rest of the Host stood on the level ground of the Portway; but\r\npresently were the ranks of war disordered and broken up by the joy of\r\nthe women and children, as they fell to drawing goodman or brother or\r\nlover out of the throng to the way that led speediest to their homesteads\r\nand halls.  For the War-leader would not hold the Host together any\r\nlonger, but suffered each man to go to his home, deeming that the men of\r\nBurgstead, and chiefly they of the Face and the Steer, would suffice for\r\na company if any need were, and they would be easily gathered to meet any\r\nhap.\r\n\r\nSo now the men of the Middle and Lower Dale made for their houses by the\r\nroad and the lanes and the meadows, and the men of the Upper Dale and\r\nBurgstead went their ways along the Portway toward their halls, with the\r\nthrong of women and children that had come out to meet them.  And now men\r\ncame home when it was yet early, and the long day lay before them; and it\r\nwas, as it were, made giddy and cumbered with the exceeding joy of\r\nreturn, and the thought of the day when the fear of death and sundering\r\nhad been ever in their hearts.  For these new hours were full of the\r\nkissing and embracing of lovers, and the sweetness of renewed delight in\r\nbeholding the fair bodies so sorely desired, and hearkening the soft\r\nwheedling of longed-for voices.  There were the cups of friends beneath\r\nthe chestnut trees, and the talk of the deeds of the fighting-men, and of\r\nthe heavy days of the home-abiders; many a tale told oft and o\xe2\x80\x99er again.\r\nThere was the singing of old songs and of new, and the beholding the\r\nwell-loved nook of the pleasant places, which death might well have made\r\nnought for them; and they were sweet with the fear of that which was\r\npast, and in their pleasantness was fresh promise for the days to come.\r\n\r\nSo amid their joyance came evening and nightfall; and though folk were\r\nweary with the fulness of delight, yet now for many their weariness led\r\nthem to the chamber of love before the rest of deep night came to them to\r\nmake them strong for the happy life to be begun again on the morrow.\r\n\r\nHouse by house they feasted, and few were the lovers that sat not\r\ntogether that even.  But Face-of-god and the Sun-beam parted at the door\r\nof the House of the Face; for needs must she go with her new folk to the\r\nHouse of the Steer, and needs must Face-of-god be amongst his own folk in\r\nthat hour of high-tide, and sit beside his father beneath the image of\r\nthe God with the ray-begirt head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.  HOW THE MAIDEN WARD WAS HELD IN BURGDALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW May was well worn when the Host came home to Burgdale; and on the\r\nvery morrow of men\xe2\x80\x99s home-coming they began to talk eagerly of the\r\nMidsummer Weddings, and how the Maiden Ward would be the greatest and\r\nfairest of all yet seen, whereas battle and the deliverance from battle\r\nstir up the longing and love both of men and maidens; much also men spake\r\nof the wedding of Face-of-god and the Sun-beam; and needs must their\r\nwedding abide to the time of the Maiden Ward at Midsummer, and needs also\r\nmust the Sun-beam go on the Ward with the other Brides of the Folk.  So\r\nthen must Face-of-god keep his soul in patience till those few days were\r\nover, doing what work came to hand; and he held his head high among the\r\npeople, and was well looked to of every man.\r\n\r\nIn all matters the Sun-beam helped him, both in doing and in forbearing;\r\nand now so wonderful and rare was her beauty, that folk looked on her\r\nwith somewhat of fear, as though she came from the very folk of the Gods.\r\n\r\nIndeed she seemed somewhat changed from what she had been of late; she\r\nwas sober of demeanour during these last days of her maidenhood, and sat\r\namongst the kindred as one communing with herself: of few words she was\r\nand little laughter; but her face clear, not overcast by any gloom or\r\nshaken by passion: soft and kind was she in converse with others, and\r\nsweet were the smiles that came into her face if others\xe2\x80\x99 faces seemed to\r\ncrave for them.  For it must be said that as some folk eat out their\r\nhearts with fear of the coming evils, even so was she feeding her soul\r\nwith the joy of the days to be, whatever trouble might fall upon them,\r\nwhereof belike she foreboded some.\r\n\r\nSo wore the days toward Midsummer, when the wheat was getting past the\r\nblossoming, and the grass in the mown fields was growing deep green again\r\nafter the shearing of the scythe; when the leaves were most and biggest;\r\nwhen the roses were beginning to fall; when the apples were reddening,\r\nand the skins of the grape-berries gathering bloom.  High aloft floated\r\nthe light clouds over the Dale; deep blue showed the distant fells below\r\nthe ice-mountains; the waters dwindled; all things sought the shadow by\r\ndaytime, and the twilight of even and the twilight of dawn were but\r\nsundered by three hours of half-dark night.\r\n\r\nSo in the bright forenoon were seventeen brides assembled in the Gate of\r\nBurgstead (but of the rest of the Dale were twenty and three looked for),\r\nand with these was the Sun-beam, her face as calm as the mountain lake\r\nunder a summer sunset, while of the others many were restless, and\r\nbabbling like April throstles; and not a few talked to her eagerly, and\r\nin their restless love of her dragged her about hither and thither.\r\n\r\nNo men were to be seen that morning; for such was the custom, that the\r\ncarles either departed to the fields and the acres, or abode within doors\r\non the morn of the day of the Maiden Ward; but there was a throng of\r\nwomen about the Gate and down the street of Burgstead, and it may well be\r\ndeemed that they kept not silence that hour.\r\n\r\nSo fared the Brides of Burgstead to the place of the Maiden Ward on the\r\ncauseway, whereto were come already the other brides from steads up and\r\ndown the Dale, or were even then close at hand on the way; and among them\r\nwere Long-coat and her two fellows, with whom Face-of-god had held\r\nconverse on that morning whereon he had followed his fate to the\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\nThere then were they gathered under the cliff-wall of the Portway; and by\r\nthe road-side had their grooms built them up bowers of green boughs to\r\nshelter them from the sun\xe2\x80\x99s burning, which were thatched with bulrushes,\r\nand decked with garlands of the fairest flowers of the meadows and the\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nForsooth they were a lovely sight to look on, for no fairer women might\r\nbe seen in the world; and the eldest of them was scant of five and twenty\r\nwinters.  Every maiden was clad in as goodly raiment as she might\r\ncompass; their sleeves and gown-hems and girdles, yea, their very shoes\r\nand sandals were embroidered so fairly and closely, that as they shifted\r\nin the sun they changed colour like the king-fisher shooting from shadow\r\nto sunshine.  According to due custom every maiden bore some weapon.  A\r\nfew had bows in their hands and quivers at their backs; some had nought\r\nbut a sword girt to their sides; some bore slender-shafted spears, so as\r\nnot to overburden their shapely hands; but to some it seemed a merry game\r\nto carry long and heavy thrust-spears, or to bear great war-axes over\r\ntheir shoulders.  Most had their flowing hair coifed with bright helms;\r\nsome had burdened their arms with shields; some bore steel hauberks over\r\ntheir linen smocks: almost all had some piece of war-gear on their\r\nbodies; and one, to wit, Steed-linden of the Sickle, a tall and fair\r\ndamsel, was so arrayed that no garment could be seen on her but bright\r\nsteel war-gear.\r\n\r\nAs for the Sun-beam, she was clad in a white kirtle embroidered from\r\nthroat to hem with work of green boughs and flowers of the goodliest\r\nfashion, and a garland of roses on her head.  Dale-warden himself was\r\ngirt to her side by a girdle fair-wrought of golden wire, and she bore no\r\nother weapon or war-gear; and she let him lie quiet in his scabbard, nor\r\ntouched the hilts once; whereas some of the other damsels would be ever\r\ndrawing their swords out and thrusting them back.  But all noted that\r\ngoodly weapon, the yoke-fellow of so many great deeds.\r\n\r\nThere then on the Portway, between the water and the rock-wall, rose up\r\nplenteous and gleeful talk of clear voices shrill and soft; and whiles\r\nthe maidens sang, and whiles they told tales of old days, and whiles they\r\njoined hands and danced together on the sweet summer dust of the highway.\r\nThen they mostly grew aweary, and sat down on the banks of the road or\r\nunder their leafy bowers.\r\n\r\nNoon came, and therewithal goodwives of the neighbouring Dale, who\r\nbrought them meat and drink, and fruit and fresh flowers from the teeming\r\ngardens; and thereafter for a while they nursed their joy in their\r\nbosoms, and spake but little and softly while the day was at its hottest\r\nin the early afternoon.\r\n\r\nThen came out of Burgstead men making semblance of chapmen with a wain\r\nbearing wares, and they made as though they were wending down the Portway\r\nwestward to go out of the Dale.  Then arose the weaponed maidens and\r\nbarred the way to them, and turned them back amidst fresh-springing\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\nAgain in a while, when the sun was westering and the shadows growing\r\nlong, came herdsmen from down the Dale driving neat, and making as though\r\nthey would pass by into Burgstead, but to them also did the maidens\r\ngainsay the road, so that needs must they turn back amidst laughter and\r\nmockery, they themselves also laughing and mocking.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last, when the maidens had been all alone a while, and it was\r\nnow hard on sunset, they drew together and stood in a ring, and fell to\r\nsinging; and one Gold-may of the House of the Bridge, a most sweet\r\nsinger, stood amidst their ring and led them.  And this is somewhat of\r\nthe meaning of their words:\r\n\r\n   The sun will not tarry; now changeth the light,\r\n   Fail the colours that marry the Day to the Night.\r\n\r\n   Amid the sun\xe2\x80\x99s burning bright weapons we bore,\r\n   For this eve of our earning comes once and no more.\r\n\r\n   For to-day hath no brother in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s tide,\r\n   And to-morrow no other alike it doth hide.\r\n\r\n   This day is the token of oath and behest\r\n   That ne\xe2\x80\x99er shall be broken through ill days and best.\r\n\r\n   Here the troth hath been given, the oath hath been done,\r\n   To the Folk that hath thriven well under the sun.\r\n\r\n   And the gifts of its giving our troth-day shall win\r\n   Are the Dale for our living and dear days therein.\r\n\r\n   O Sun, now thou wanest! yet come back and see\r\n   Amidst all that thou gainest how gainful are we.\r\n\r\n   O witness of sorrow wide over the earth,\r\n   Rise up on the morrow to look on our mirth!\r\n\r\n   Thy blooms art thou bringing back ever for men,\r\n   And thy birds are a-singing each summer again.\r\n\r\n   But to men little-hearted what winter is worse\r\n   Than thy summers departed that bore them the curse?\r\n\r\n   And e\xe2\x80\x99en such art thou knowing where thriveth the year,\r\n   And good is all growing save thralldom and fear.\r\n\r\n   Nought such be our lovers\xe2\x80\x99 hearts drawing anigh,\r\n   While yet thy light hovers aloft in the sky.\r\n\r\n   Lo the seeker, the finder of Death in the Blade!\r\n   What lips shall be kinder on lips of mine laid?\r\n\r\n   La he that hath driven back tribes of the South!\r\n   Sweet-breathed is thine even, but sweeter his mouth.\r\n\r\n   Come back from the sea then, O sun! come aback,\r\n   Look adown, look on me then, and ask what I lack!\r\n\r\n   Come many a morrow to gaze on the Dale,\r\n   And if e\xe2\x80\x99er thou seest sorrow remember its tale!\r\n\r\n   For \xe2\x80\x99twill be of a story to tell how men died\r\n   In the garnering of glory that no man may hide.\r\n\r\n   O sun sinking under!  O fragrance of earth!\r\n   O heart!  O the wonder whence longing has birth!\r\n\r\nSo they sang, and the sun sank indeed; and amidst their singing the eve\r\nwas still about them, though there came a happy murmur from the face of\r\nthe meadows and the houses of the Thorp aloof.  But as their song fell\r\nthey heard the sound of footsteps a many on the road; so they turned and\r\nstood with beating hearts in such order as when a band of the valiant\r\ndraw together to meet many foes coming on them from all sides, and they\r\nstand back to back to face all comers.  And even therewith, their raiment\r\ngleaming amidst the gathering dusk, came on them the young men of the\r\nDale newly delivered from the grief of war.\r\n\r\nThen in very deed the fierce mouths of the raisers of the war-shout were\r\nkind on the faces of tender maidens.  Then went spear and axe and helm\r\nand shield clattering to the earth, as the arms of the new-comers went\r\nround about the bodies of the Brides, weary with the long day of\r\nsunshine, and glee and loving speech, and the maidens suffered the young\r\nmen to lead them whither they would, and twilight began to draw round\r\nabout them as the Maiden Band was sundered.\r\n\r\nSome, they were led away westward down the Portway to the homesteads\r\nthereabout; and for divers of these the way was long to their halls, and\r\nthey would have to wend over long stretches of dewy meadows, and hear the\r\nnight-wind whisper in many a tree, and see the east begin to lighten with\r\nthe dawn before they came to the lighted feast that awaited them.  But\r\nsome turned up the Portway straight towards Burgstead; and short was\r\ntheir road to the halls where even now the lights were being kindled for\r\ntheir greeting.\r\n\r\nAs for the Sun-beam, she had been very quiet the day long, speaking as\r\nlittle as she might do, laughing not at all, and smiling for kindness\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsake rather than for merriment; and when the grooms came seeking their\r\nmaidens, she withdrew herself from the band, and stood alone amidst the\r\nroad nigher to Burgstead than they; and her heart beat hard, and her\r\nbreath came short and quick, as though fear had caught her in its grip;\r\nand indeed for one moment of time she feared that he was not coming to\r\nher.  For he had gone with the other grooms to that gathered band, and\r\nhad passed from one to the other, not finding her, till he had got him\r\nthrough the whole company, and beheld her awaiting him.  Then indeed he\r\nbounded toward her, and caught her by the hands, and then by the\r\nshoulders, and drew her to him, and she nothing loth; and in that while\r\nhe said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come then, my friend; lo thou! they go each their own way toward the\r\nhalls of their houses; and for thee have I chosen a way\xe2\x80\x94a way over the\r\nfoot-bridge yonder, and over the dewy meadows on this best even of the\r\nyear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98it may not be.  Surely the Burgstead grooms look\r\nto thee to lead them to the gate; and surely in the House of the Face\r\nthey look to see thee before any other.  Nay, Gold-mane, my dear, we must\r\nneeds go by the Portway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x98We shall be home but a very little while after the first, for\r\nthe way I tell of is as short as the Portway.  But hearken, my sweet!\r\nWhen we are in the meadows we shall sit down for a minute on a bank under\r\nthe chestnut trees, and thence watch the moon coming up over the southern\r\ncliffs.  And I shall behold thee in the summer night, and deem that I see\r\nall thy beauty; which yet shall make me dumb with wonder when I see it\r\nindeed in the house amongst the candles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98by the Portway shall we go; the torch-bearers shall\r\nbe abiding thee at the gate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSpake Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x98Then shall we rise up and wend first through a wide\r\ntreeless meadow, wherein amidst the night we shall behold the kine moving\r\nabout like odorous shadows; and through the greyness of the moonlight\r\nthou shalt deem that thou seest the pink colour of the eglantine\r\nblossoms, so fragrant they are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but it is meet that we go by the Portway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut he said: \xe2\x80\x98Then from the wide meadow come we into a close of corn, and\r\nthen into an orchard-close beyond it.  There in the ancient walnut-tree\r\nthe owl sitteth breathing hard in the night-time; but thou shalt not hear\r\nhim for the joy of the nightingales singing from the apple-trees of the\r\nclose.  Then from out of the shadowed orchard shall we come into the open\r\ntown-meadow, and over its daisies shall the moonlight be lying in a grey\r\nflood of brightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Short is the way across it to the brim of the Weltering Water, and\r\nacross the water lieth the fair garden of the Face; and I have dight for\r\nthee there a little boat to waft us across the night-dark waters, that\r\nshall be like wavering flames of white fire where the moon smites them,\r\nand like the void of all things where the shadows hang over them.  There\r\nthen shall we be in the garden, beholding how the hall-windows are\r\nyellow, and hearkening the sound of the hall-glee borne across the\r\nflowers and blending with the voice of the nightingales in the trees.\r\nThere then shall we go along the grass paths whereby the pinks and the\r\ncloves and the lavender are sending forth their fragrance, to cheer us,\r\nwho faint at the scent of the over-worn roses, and the honey-sweetness of\r\nthe lilies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All this is for thee, and for nought but for thee this even; and many a\r\nblossom whereof thou knowest nought shall grieve if thy foot tread not\r\nthereby to-night; if the path of thy wedding which I have made, be void\r\nof thee, on the even of the Chamber of Love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But lo! at last at the garden\xe2\x80\x99s end is the yew-walk arched over for\r\nthee, and thou canst not see whereby to enter it; but I, I know it, and I\r\nlead thee into and along the dark tunnel through the moonlight, and thine\r\nhand is not weary of mine as we go.  But at the end shall we come to a\r\nwicket, which shall bring us out by the gable-end of the Hall of the\r\nFace.  Turn we about its corner then, and there are we blinking on the\r\ntorches of the torch-bearers, and the candles through the open door, and\r\nthe hall ablaze with light and full of joyous clamour, like the bale-fire\r\nin the dark night kindled on a ness above the sea by fisher-folk\r\nremembering the Gods.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O nay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but by the Portway must we go; the straightest way to\r\nthe Gate of Burgstead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn vain she spake, and knew not what she said; for even as he was\r\nspeaking he led her away, and her feet went as her will went, rather than\r\nher words; and even as she said that last word she set her foot on the\r\nfirst board of the foot-bridge; and she turned aback one moment, and saw\r\nthe long line of the rock-wall yet glowing with the last of the sunset of\r\nmidsummer, while as she turned again, lo! before her the moon just\r\nbeginning to lift himself above the edge of the southern cliffs, and\r\nbetwixt her and him all Burgdale, and Face-of-god moreover.\r\n\r\nThus then they crossed the bridge into the green meadows, and through the\r\ncloses and into the garden of the Face and unto the Hall-door; and other\r\nbrides and grooms were there before them (for six grooms had brought home\r\nbrides to the House of the Face); but none deemed it amiss in the\r\nWar-leader of the folk and the love that had led him.  And old Stone-face\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Too many are the rows of bee-skeps in the gardens of the Dale that\r\nwe should begrudge wayward lovers an hour\xe2\x80\x99s waste of candle-light.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo at last those twain went up the sun-bright Hall hand in hand in all\r\ntheir loveliness, and up on to the da\xc3\xafs, and stood together by the middle\r\nseat; and the tumult of the joy of the kindred was hushed for a while as\r\nthey saw that there was speech in the mouth of the War-leader.\r\n\r\nThen he spread his hands abroad before them all and cried out: \xe2\x80\x98How then\r\nhave I kept mine oath, whereas I swore on the Holy Boar to wed the\r\nfairest woman of the world?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA mighty shout went rattling about the timbers of the roof in answer to\r\nhis word; and they that looked up to the gable of the Hall said that they\r\nsaw the ray-ringed image of the God smile with joy over the gathered\r\nfolk.\r\n\r\nBut spake Iron-face unheard amidst the clamour of the Hall: \xe2\x80\x98How fares it\r\nnow with my darling and my daughter, who dwelleth amongst strangers in\r\nthe land beyond the wild-wood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.  THE BEHEST OF FACE-OF-GOD TO THE BRIDE ACCOMPLISHED: A\r\nMOTE-STEAD APPOINTED FOR THE THREE FOLKS, TO WIT, THE MEN OF BURGDALE,\r\nTHE SHEPHERDS, AND THE CHILDREN OF THE WOLF.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE years and two months thereafter, three hours after noon in the days\r\nof early autumn, came a wain tilted over with precious webs of cloth, and\r\ndrawn by eight white oxen, into the Market-place of Silver-stead: two\r\nscore and ten of spearmen of the tallest, clad in goodly war-gear, went\r\nbeside it, and much people of Silver-dale thronged about them.  The wain\r\nstayed at the foot of the stair that led up to the door of the\r\nMote-house, and there lighted down therefrom a woman goodly of fashion,\r\nwith wide grey eyes, and face and hands brown with the sun\xe2\x80\x99s burning.\r\nShe had a helm on her head and a sword girt to her side, and in her arms\r\nshe bore a yearling child.\r\n\r\nAnd there was come Bow-may with the second man-child born to Face-of-god.\r\n\r\nShe stayed not amidst the wondering folk, but hastened up the stair,\r\nwhich she had once seen running with the blood of men: the door was open,\r\nand she went in and walked straight-way, with the babe in her arms, up\r\nthe great Hall to the da\xc3\xafs.\r\n\r\nThere were men on the da\xc3\xafs: amidmost sat Folk-might, little changed since\r\nthe last day she had seen him, yet fairer, she deemed, than of old time;\r\nand her heart went forth to meet the Chieftain of her Folk, and the glad\r\ntears started in her eyes and ran down her cheeks as she drew near to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBy his side sat the Bride, and her also Bow-may deemed to have waxed\r\ngoodlier.  Both she and Folk-might knew Bow-may ere she had gone half the\r\nlength of the hall; and the Bride rose up in her place and cried out\r\nBow-may\xe2\x80\x99s name joyously.\r\n\r\nWith these were sitting the elders of the Wolf and the Woodlanders, the\r\nmore part of whom Bow-may knew well.\r\n\r\nOn the da\xc3\xafs also stood aside a score of men weaponed, and looking as if\r\nthey were awaiting the word which should send them forth on some errand.\r\n\r\nNow stood up Folk-might and said: \xe2\x80\x98Fair greeting and love to my friend\r\nand the daughter of my Folk!  How farest thou, Bow-may, best of all\r\nfriendly women?  How fareth my sister, and Face-of-god my brother? and\r\nhow is it with our friends and helpers in the goodly Dale?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Bow-may: \xe2\x80\x98It is well both with all those and with me; and my heart\r\nlaughs to see thee, Folk-might, and to look on the elders of the valiant,\r\nand our lovely sister the Bride.  But I have a message for thee from\r\nFace-of-god: wilt thou that I deliver it here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, and came forth and took her hand, and\r\nkissed her cheeks and her mouth.  The Bride also came forth and cast her\r\narms about her, and kissed her; and they led her between them to a seat\r\non the da\xc3\xafs beside Folk-might.\r\n\r\nBut all men looked on the child in her arms and wondered what it was.\r\nBut Bow-may took the babe, which was both fair and great, and set it on\r\nthe knees of the Bride, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thus saith Face-of-god: \xe2\x80\x9cFriend and kinswoman, well-beloved playmate,\r\nthe gift which thou badest of me in sorrow do thou now take in joy, and\r\ndo all the good thou wouldest to the son of thy friend.  The ring which I\r\ngave thee once in the garden of the Face, give thou to Bow-may, my trusty\r\nand well-beloved, in token of the fulfilment of my behest.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the Bride kissed Bow-may again, and fell to fondling of the child,\r\nwhich was loth to leave Bow-may.\r\n\r\nBut she spake again: \xe2\x80\x98To thee also, Folk-might, I have a message from\r\nFace-of-god, who saith: \xe2\x80\x9cMighty warrior, friend and fellow, all things\r\nthrive with us, and we are happy.  Yet is there a hollow place in our\r\nhearts which grieveth us, and only thou and thine may amend it.  Though\r\nwhiles we hear tell of thee, yet we see thee not, and fain were we, might\r\nwe see thee, and wot if the said tales be true.  Wilt thou help us\r\nsomewhat herein, or wilt thou leave us all the labour?  For sure we be\r\nthat thou wilt not say that thou rememberest us no more, and that thy\r\nlove for us is departed.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is his message, Folk-might, and he would\r\nhave an answer from thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen laughed Folk-might and said: \xe2\x80\x98Sister Bow-may, seest thou these\r\nweaponed men hereby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nSaid he: \xe2\x80\x98These men bear a message with them to Face-of-god my brother.\r\nCrow the Shaft-speeder, stand forth and tell thy friend Bow-may the\r\nmessage I have set in thy mouth, every word of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Crow stood forth and greeted Bow-may friendly, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Friend\r\nBow-may, this is the message of our Alderman: \xe2\x80\x9cFriend and helper, in the\r\nDale which thou hast given to us do all things thrive; neither are we\r\ngrown old in three years\xe2\x80\x99 wearing, nor are our memories worsened.  We\r\nlong sore to see you and give you guesting in Silver-dale, and one day\r\nthat shall befall.  Meanwhile, know this: that we of the Wolf and the\r\nWoodland, mindful of the earth that bore us, and the pit whence we were\r\ndigged, have a mind to go see Shadowy Vale once in every three years, and\r\nthere to hold high-tide in the ancient Hall of the Wolf, and sit in the\r\nDoom-ring of our Fathers.  But since ye have joined yourselves to us in\r\nbattle, and have given us this Dale, our health and wealth, without price\r\nand without reward, we deem you our very brethren, and small shall be our\r\nhall-glee, and barren shall our Doom-ring seem to us, unless ye sit there\r\nbeside us.  Come then, that we may rejoice each other by the sight of\r\nface and sound of voice; that we may speak together of matters that\r\nconcern our welfare; so that we three Kindreds may become one Folk.  And\r\nif this seem good to you, know that we shall be in Shadowy Vale in a\r\nhalf-month\xe2\x80\x99s wearing.  Grieve us not by forbearing to come.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lo,\r\nBow-may, this is the message, and I have learned it well, for well it\r\npleaseth me to bear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen said Folk-might: \xe2\x80\x98What say\xe2\x80\x99st thou to the message, Bow-may?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is good in all ways,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98but is it timely?  May our folk have\r\nthe message and get to Shadowy Vale, so as to meet you there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98for our kinsmen here shall take the road\r\nthrough Shadowy Vale, and in four days\xe2\x80\x99 time they shall be in Burgdale,\r\nand as thou wottest, it is scant a two days\xe2\x80\x99 journey thence to Shadowy\r\nVale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith he turned to those men again, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Kinsman Crow, depart\r\nnow, and use all diligence with thy message.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the messengers began to stir; but Bow-may cried out: \xe2\x80\x98Ho!  Folk-might,\r\nmy friend, I perceive thou art little changed from the man I knew in\r\nShadowy Vale, who would have his dinner before the fowl were plucked.\r\nFor shall I not go back with these thy messengers, so that I also may get\r\nall ready to wend to the Mote-house of Shadowy Vale?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the Bride looked kindly on her, and laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98Sister\r\nBow-may, his meaning is that thou shouldest abide here in Silver-dale\r\ntill we depart for the Folk-thing, and then go thither with us; and this\r\nI also pray thee to do, that thou mayst rejoice the hearts of thine old\r\nfriends; and also that thou mayst teach me all that I should know\r\nconcerning this fair child of my brother and my sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she looked on her so kindly as she caressed the babe, that Bow-may\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart melted, and she cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would that I might never depart from the house wherein thou dwellest, O\r\nBride of my Kinsman!  And this that thou biddest me is easy and pleasant\r\nfor me to do.  But afterwards I must get me back to Burgdale; for I seem\r\nto have left much there that calleth for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might, \xe2\x80\x98and art thou wedded, Bow-may?  Shalt thou never\r\nbend the yew in battle again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Bow-may soberly: \xe2\x80\x98Who knoweth, chieftain?  Yea, I am wedded now\r\nthese two years; and nought I looked for less when I followed those twain\r\nthrough the wild-wood to Burgdale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe sighed therewith, and said: \xe2\x80\x98In all the Dale there is no better man\r\nof his hands than my man, nor any goodlier to look on, and he is even\r\nthat Hart of Highcliff whom thou knowest well, O Bride!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid the Bride: \xe2\x80\x98Thou sayest sooth, there is no better man in the Dale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Bow-may: \xe2\x80\x98Sun-beam bade me wed him when he pressed hard upon me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe stayed awhile, and then said: \xe2\x80\x98Face-of-god also deemed I should not\r\nnaysay the man; and now my son by him is of like age to this little one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good is thy story,\xe2\x80\x99 said Folk-might; \xe2\x80\x98or deemest thou, Bow-may, that\r\nsuch strong and goodly women as thou, and women so kind and friendly,\r\nshould forbear the wedding and the bringing forth of children?  Yea, and\r\nwe who may even yet have to gather to another field before we die, and\r\nfight for life and the goods of life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou sayest well,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98all that hath befallen me is good since\r\nthe day whereon I loosed shaft from the break of the bent over yonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherewith she fell a-musing, and made as though she were hearkening to\r\nthe soft voice of the Bride caressing the new-come baby; but in sooth\r\nneither heard nor saw what was going on about her, for her thoughts were\r\nin bygone days.  Howbeit presently she came to herself again, and fell to\r\nasking many questions concerning Silver-dale and the kindred, and those\r\nwho had once been thralls of the Dusky Men; and they answered all duly,\r\nand told her the whole story of the Dale since the Day of the Victory.\r\n\r\nSo Bow-may and the carles who had come with her abode for that half-month\r\nin Silver-dale, guested in all love by the folk thereof, both the\r\nkindreds and the poor folk.  And Bow-may deemed that the Bride loved\r\nFace-of-god\xe2\x80\x99s child little less than her own, whereof she had two, a man\r\nand a woman; and thereat was she full of joy, since she knew that\r\nFace-of-god and the Sun-beam would be fain thereof.\r\n\r\nThereafter, when the time was come, fared Folk-might and the Bride, and\r\nmany of the elders and warriors of the Wolf and the Woodland, to Shadowy\r\nVale; and Dallach and the best of Rose-dale went with them, being so\r\nbidden; and Bow-may and her following, according to the word of the\r\nBride.  And in Shadowy Vale they met Face-of-god and Alderman Iron-face,\r\nand the chiefs of Burgdale and the Shepherds, and many others; and great\r\njoy there was at the meeting.  And the Sun-beam remembered the word which\r\nshe spoke to Face-of-god when first he came to Shadowy Vale, that she\r\nwould be wishful to see again the dwelling wherein she had passed through\r\nso much joy and sorrow of her younger days.  But if anyone were fain of\r\nthis meeting, the Alderman was glad above all, when he took the Bride\r\nonce more in his arms, and caressed her whom he had deemed should be a\r\nvery daughter of his House.\r\n\r\nNow telleth the tale of all these kindreds, to wit, the Men of Burgdale\r\nand the Sheepcotes; and the Children of the Wolf, and the Woodlanders,\r\nand the Men of Rose-dale, that they were friends henceforth, and became\r\nas one Folk, for better or worse, in peace and in war, in waning and\r\nwaxing; and that whatsoever befell them, they ever held Shadowy Vale a\r\nholy place, and for long and long after they met there in mid-autumn, and\r\nheld converse and counsel together.\r\n\r\nNO MORE AS NOW TELLETH THE TALE OF THESE KINDREDS AND FOLKS, BUT MAKETH\r\nAN ENDING.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n           CHISWICK PRESS:\xe2\x80\x94C.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
