In the first place, her gentle and delicate presence,\r\nher sad, short story, her hard life and early death, enter deeply into\r\nthe poetry and tragedy that have always been entwined with the memory\r\nof the Bront\xc3\xabs, as women and as writers; in the second, the books and\r\npoems that she wrote serve as matter of comparison by which to test the\r\ngreatness of her two sisters. She is the measure of their genius\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nthem, yet not with them.\r\n\r\nMany years after Anne\xe2\x80\x99s death her brother-in-law protested against a\r\nsupposed portrait of her, as giving a totally wrong impression of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdear, gentle Anne Bront\xc3\xab.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDear\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgentle\xe2\x80\x9d indeed she seems to\r\nhave been through life, the youngest and prettiest of the sisters, with\r\na delicate complexion, a slender neck, and small, pleasant features.\r\nNotwithstanding, she possessed in full the Bront\xc3\xab seriousness, the\r\nBront\xc3\xab strength of will. When her father asked her at four years old\r\nwhat a little child like her wanted most, the tiny creature replied\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nit were not a Bront\xc3\xab it would be incredible!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAge and experience.\xe2\x80\x9d When\r\nthe three children started their \xe2\x80\x9cIsland Plays\xe2\x80\x9d together in 1827, Anne,\r\nwho was then eight, chose Guernsey for her imaginary island, and\r\npeopled it with \xe2\x80\x9cMichael Sadler, Lord Bentinck, and Sir Henry Halford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe and Emily were constant companions, and there is evidence that they\r\nshared a common world of fancy from very early days to mature\r\nwomanhood. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gondal Chronicles\xe2\x80\x9d seem to have amused them for many\r\nyears, and to have branched out into innumerable books, written in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctiny writing\xe2\x80\x9d of which Mr. Clement Shorter has given us facsimiles. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam now engaged in writing the fourth volume of Solala Vernon\xe2\x80\x99s Life,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays Anne at twenty-one. And four years later Emily says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gondals\r\nstill flourish bright as ever. I am at present writing a work on the\r\nFirst War. Anne has been writing some articles on this and a book by\r\nHenry Sophona. We intend sticking firm by the rascals as long as they\r\ndelight us, which I am glad to say they do at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat the author of \xe2\x80\x9cWildfell Hall\xe2\x80\x9d should ever have delighted in the\r\nGondals, should ever have written the story of Solala Vernon or Henry\r\nSophona, is pleasant to know. Then, for her too, as for her sisters,\r\nthere was a moment when the power of \xe2\x80\x9cmaking out\xe2\x80\x9d could turn loneliness\r\nand disappointment into riches and content. For a time at least, and\r\nbefore a hard and degrading experience had broken the spring of her\r\nyouth, and replaced the disinterested and spontaneous pleasure that is\r\nto be got from the life and play of imagination, by a sad sense of\r\nduty, and an inexorable consciousness of moral and religious mission,\r\nAnne Bront\xc3\xab wrote stories for her own amusement, and loved the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crascals\xe2\x80\x9d she created.\r\n\r\nBut already in 1841, when we first hear of the Gondals and Solala\r\nVernon, the material for quite other books was in poor Anne\xe2\x80\x99s mind. She\r\nwas then teaching in the family at Thorpe Green, where Branwell joined\r\nher as tutor in 1843, and where, owing to events that are still a\r\nmystery, she seems to have passed through an ordeal that left her\r\nshattered in health and nerve, with nothing gained but those melancholy\r\nand repulsive memories that she was afterwards to embody in \xe2\x80\x9cWildfell\r\nHall.\xe2\x80\x9d She seems, indeed, to have been partly the victim of Branwell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmorbid imagination, the imagination of an opium-eater and a drunkard.\r\nThat he was neither the conqueror nor the villain that he made his\r\nsisters believe, all the evidence that has been gathered since Mrs.\r\nGaskell wrote goes to show. But poor Anne believed his account of\r\nhimself, and no doubt saw enough evidence of vicious character in\r\nBranwell\xe2\x80\x99s daily life to make the worst enormities credible. She seems\r\nto have passed the last months of her stay at Thorpe Green under a\r\ncloud of dread and miserable suspicion, and was thankful to escape from\r\nher situation in the summer of 1845. At the same moment Branwell was\r\nsummarily dismissed from his tutorship, his employer, Mr. Robinson,\r\nwriting a stern letter of complaint to Branwell\xe2\x80\x99s father, concerned no\r\ndoubt with the young man\xe2\x80\x99s disorderly and intemperate habits. Mrs.\r\nGaskell says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe premature deaths of two at least of the sisters\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthe great possibilities of their earthly lives snapped short\xe2\x80\x94may be\r\ndated from Midsummer 1845.\xe2\x80\x9d The facts as we now know them hardly bear\r\nout so strong a judgment. There is nothing to show that Branwell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct was responsible in any way for Emily\xe2\x80\x99s illness and death, and\r\nAnne, in the contemporary fragment recovered by Mr. Shorter, gives a\r\nless tragic account of the matter. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring my stay (at Thorpe Green),\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe writes on July 31, 1845, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had some very unpleasant and\r\nundreamt-of experience of human nature. . . . Branwell has . . . been a\r\ntutor at Thorpe Green, and had much tribulation and ill-health. . . .\r\nWe hope he will be better and do better in future.\xe2\x80\x9d And at the end of\r\nthe paper she says, sadly, forecasting the coming years, \xe2\x80\x9cI for my part\r\ncannot well be flatter or older in mind than I am now.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the\r\nlanguage of disappointment and anxiety; but it hardly fits the tragic\r\nstory that Mrs. Gaskell believed.\r\n\r\nThat story was, no doubt, the elaboration of Branwell\xe2\x80\x99s diseased fancy\r\nduring the three years which elapsed between his dismissal from Thorpe\r\nGreen and his death. He imagined a guilty romance with himself and his\r\nemployer\xe2\x80\x99s wife for characters, and he imposed the horrid story upon\r\nhis sisters. Opium and drink are the sufficient explanations; and no\r\ntime need now be wasted upon unravelling the sordid mystery. But the\r\nvices of the brother, real or imaginary, have a certain importance in\r\nliterature, because of the effect they produced upon his sisters. There\r\ncan be no question that Branwell\xe2\x80\x99s opium madness, his bouts of\r\ndrunkenness at the Black Bull, his violence at home, his free and\r\ncoarse talk, and his perpetual boast of guilty secrets, influenced the\r\nimagination of his wholly pure and inexperienced sisters. Much of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWuthering Heights,\xe2\x80\x9d and all of \xe2\x80\x9cWildfell Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d show Branwell\xe2\x80\x99s mark,\r\nand there are many passages in Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s books also where those who\r\nknow the history of the parsonage can hear the voice of those sharp\r\nmoral repulsions, those dismal moral questionings, to which Branwell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmisconduct and ruin gave rise. Their brother\xe2\x80\x99s fate was an element in\r\nthe genius of Emily and Charlotte which they were strong enough to\r\nassimilate, which may have done them some harm, and weakened in them\r\ncertain delicate or sane perceptions, but was ultimately, by the\r\nstrange alchemy of talent, far more profitable than hurtful, inasmuch\r\nas it troubled the waters of the soul, and brought them near to the\r\nmore desperate realities of our \xe2\x80\x9cfrail, fall\xe2\x80\x99n humankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Anne was not strong enough, her gift was not vigorous enough, to\r\nenable her thus to transmute experience and grief. The probability is\r\nthat when she left Thorpe Green in 1845 she was already suffering from\r\nthat religious melancholy of which Charlotte discovered such piteous\r\nevidence among her papers after death. It did not much affect the\r\nwriting of \xe2\x80\x9cAgnes Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d which was completed in 1846, and reflected the\r\nminor pains and discomforts of her teaching experience, but it combined\r\nwith the spectacle of Branwell\xe2\x80\x99s increasing moral and physical decay to\r\nproduce that bitter mandate of conscience under which she wrote \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nTenant of Wildfell Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHers was naturally a sensitive, reserved, and dejected nature. She\r\nhated her work, but would pursue it. It was written as a warning,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nsaid Charlotte when, in the pathetic Preface of 1850, she was\r\nendeavouring to explain to the public how a creature so gentle and so\r\ngood as Acton Bell should have written such a book as \xe2\x80\x9cWildfell Hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd in the second edition of \xe2\x80\x9cWildfell Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d which appeared in 1848,\r\nAnne Bront\xc3\xab herself justified her novel in a Preface which is reprinted\r\nin this volume for the first time. The little Preface is a curious\r\ndocument. It has the same determined didactic tone which pervades the\r\nbook itself, the same narrowness of view, and inflation of expression,\r\nan inflation which is really due not to any personal egotism in the\r\nwriter, but rather to that very gentleness and inexperience which must\r\nyet nerve itself under the stimulus of religion to its disagreeable and\r\nrepulsive task. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that such characters\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as Huntingdon and his\r\ncompanions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdo exist, and if I have warned one rash youth from\r\nfollowing in their steps the book has not been written in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d If the\r\nstory has given more pain than pleasure to \xe2\x80\x9cany honest reader,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nwriter \xe2\x80\x9ccraves his pardon, for such was far from my intention.\xe2\x80\x9d But at\r\nthe same time she cannot promise to limit her ambition to the giving of\r\ninnocent pleasure, or to the production of \xe2\x80\x9ca perfect work of art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime and talent so spent I should consider wasted and misapplied.\xe2\x80\x9d God\r\nhas given her unpalatable truths to speak, and she must speak them.\r\n\r\nThe measure of misconstruction and abuse, therefore, which her book\r\nbrought upon her she bore, says her sister, \xe2\x80\x9cas it was her custom to\r\nbear whatever was unpleasant, with mild, steady patience. She was a\r\nvery sincere and practical Christian, but the tinge of religious\r\nmelancholy communicated a sad shade to her brief, blameless life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of misconstruction and abuse, however, \xe2\x80\x9cWildfell Hall\xe2\x80\x9d seems\r\nto have attained more immediate success than anything else written by\r\nthe sisters before 1848, except \xe2\x80\x9cJane Eyre.\xe2\x80\x9d It went into a second\r\nedition within a very short time of its publication, and Messrs. Newby\r\ninformed the American publishers with whom they were negotiating that\r\nit was the work of the same hand which had produced \xe2\x80\x9cJane Eyre,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsuperior to either \xe2\x80\x9cJane Eyre\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWuthering Heights\xe2\x80\x9d! It was, indeed,\r\nthe sharp practice connected with this astonishing judgment which led\r\nto the sisters\xe2\x80\x99 hurried journey to London in 1848\xe2\x80\x94the famous journey\r\nwhen the two little ladies in black revealed themselves to Mr. Smith,\r\nand proved to him that they were not one Currer Bell, but two Miss\r\nBront\xc3\xabs. It was Anne\xe2\x80\x99s sole journey to London\xe2\x80\x94her only contact with a\r\nworld that was not Haworth, except that supplied by her school-life at\r\nRoehead and her two teaching engagements.\r\n\r\nAnd there was and is a considerable narrative ability, a sheer moral\r\nenergy in \xe2\x80\x9cWildfell Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d which would not be enough, indeed, to keep\r\nit alive if it were not the work of a Bront\xc3\xab, but still betray its\r\nkinship and source. The scenes of Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s wickedness are less\r\ninteresting but less improbable than the country-house scenes of \xe2\x80\x9cJane\r\nEyre\xe2\x80\x9d; the story of his death has many true and touching passages; the\r\nlast love-scene is well, even in parts admirably, written. But the\r\nbook\xe2\x80\x99s truth, so far as it is true, is scarcely the truth of\r\nimagination; it is rather the truth of a tract or a report. There can\r\nbe little doubt that many of the pages are close transcripts from\r\nBranwell\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and language,\xe2\x80\x94so far as Anne\xe2\x80\x99s slighter personality\r\nenabled her to render her brother\xe2\x80\x99s temperament, which was more akin to\r\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s than to her own. The same material might have been used by\r\nEmily or Charlotte; Emily, as we know, did make use of it in \xe2\x80\x9cWuthering\r\nHeights\xe2\x80\x9d; but only after it had passed through that ineffable\r\ntransformation, that mysterious, incommunicable heightening which makes\r\nand gives rank in literature. Some subtle, innate correspondence\r\nbetween eye and brain, between brain and hand, was present in Emily and\r\nCharlotte, and absent in Anne. There is no other account to be given of\r\nthis or any other case of difference between serviceable talent and the\r\nhigh gifts of \xe2\x80\x9cDelos\xe2\x80\x9d and Patara\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cApollo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same world of difference appears between her poems and those of her\r\nplayfellow and comrade, Emily. If ever our descendants should establish\r\nthe schools for writers which are even now threatened or attempted,\r\nthey will hardly know perhaps any better than we what genius is, nor\r\nhow it can be produced. But if they try to teach by example, then Anne\r\nand Emily Bront\xc3\xab are ready to their hand. Take the verses written by\r\nEmily at Roehead which contain the lovely lines which I have already\r\nquoted in an earlier \xe2\x80\x9cIntroduction.\xe2\x80\x9d[1] Just before those lines there\r\nare two or three verses which it is worth while to compare with a poem\r\nof Anne\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cHome.\xe2\x80\x9d Emily was sixteen at the time of writing; Anne\r\nabout twenty-one or twenty-two. Both sisters take for their motive the\r\nexile\xe2\x80\x99s longing thought of home. Emily\xe2\x80\x99s lines are full of faults, but\r\nthey have the indefinable quality\xe2\x80\x94here, no doubt, only in the bud, only\r\nas a matter of promise\xe2\x80\x94which Anne\xe2\x80\x99s are entirely without. From the\r\ntwilight schoolroom at Roehead, Emily turns in thought to the distant\r\nupland of Haworth and the little stone-built house upon its crest:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThere is a spot, \xe2\x80\x99mid barren hills,\r\n    Where winter howls, and driving rain;\r\nBut, if the dreary tempest chills,\r\n    There is a light that warms again.\r\n\r\nThe house is old, the trees are bare,\r\n    Moonless above bends twilight\xe2\x80\x99s dome,\r\nBut what on earth is half so dear\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    So longed for\xe2\x80\x94as the hearth of home?\r\n\r\nThe mute bird sitting on the stone,\r\n    The dank moss dripping from the wall,\r\nThe thorn-trees gaunt, the walks o\xe2\x80\x99ergrown,\r\n    I love them\xe2\x80\x94how I love them all!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s verses, written from one of the houses where she was a\r\ngoverness, express precisely the same feeling, and movement of mind.\r\nBut notice the instinctive rightness and swiftness of Emily\xe2\x80\x99s, the\r\nblurred weakness of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFor yonder garden, fair and wide,\r\n    With groves of evergreen,\r\nLong winding walks, and borders trim,\r\n    And velvet lawns between\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRestore to me that little spot,\r\n    With gray walls compassed round,\r\nWhere knotted grass neglected lies,\r\n    And weeds usurp the ground.\r\n\r\nThough all around this mansion high\r\n    Invites the foot to roam,\r\nAnd though its halls are fair within\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Oh, give me back my Home!\r\n\r\n\r\nA similar parallel lies between Anne\xe2\x80\x99s lines \xe2\x80\x9cDomestic Peace,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a sad\r\nand true reflection of the terrible times with Branwell in 1846\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWanderer from the Fold\xe2\x80\x9d; while in Emily\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLast Lines,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ndaring spirit of the sister to whom the magic gift was granted\r\nseparates itself for ever from the gentle and accustomed piety of the\r\nsister to whom it was denied. Yet Anne\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLast Lines\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped that\r\nwith the brave and strong\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94have sweetness and sincerity; they have\r\ngained and kept a place in English religious verse, and they must\r\nalways appeal to those who love the Bront\xc3\xabs because, in the language of\r\nChristian faith and submission, they record the death of Emily and the\r\npassionate affection which her sisters bore her.\r\n\r\nAnd so we are brought back to the point from which we started. It is\r\nnot as the writer of \xe2\x80\x9cWildfell Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d but as the sister of Charlotte\r\nand Emily Bront\xc3\xab, that Anne Bront\xc3\xab escapes oblivion\xe2\x80\x94as the frail\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clittle one,\xe2\x80\x9d upon whom the other two lavished a tender and protecting\r\ncare, who was a witness of Emily\xe2\x80\x99s death, and herself, within a few\r\nminutes of her own farewell to life, bade Charlotte \xe2\x80\x9ctake courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen my thoughts turn to Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte many years earlier,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey always see her as a patient, persecuted stranger,\xe2\x80\x94more lonely,\r\nless gifted with the power of making friends even than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d Later on,\r\nhowever, this power of making friends seems to have belonged to Anne in\r\ngreater measure than to the others. Her gentleness conquered; she was\r\nnot set apart, as they were, by the lonely and self-sufficing\r\nactivities of great powers; her Christianity, though sad and timid, was\r\nof a kind which those around her could understand; she made no grim\r\nfight with suffering and death as did Emily. Emily was \xe2\x80\x9ctorn\xe2\x80\x9d from life\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cconscious, panting, reluctant,\xe2\x80\x9d to use Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s own words; Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csufferings were mild,\xe2\x80\x9d her mind \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally serene,\xe2\x80\x9d and at the last\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe thanked God that death was come, and come so gently.\xe2\x80\x9d When\r\nCharlotte returned to the desolate house at Haworth, Emily\xe2\x80\x99s large\r\nhouse-dog and Anne\xe2\x80\x99s little spaniel welcomed her in \xe2\x80\x9ca strange,\r\nheart-touching way,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes to Mr. Williams. She alone was left,\r\nheir to all the memories and tragedies of the house. She took up again\r\nthe task of life and labour. She cared for her father; she returned to\r\nthe writing of \xe2\x80\x9cShirley\xe2\x80\x9d; and when she herself passed away, four years\r\nlater, she had so turned those years to account that not only all she\r\ndid but all she loved had passed silently into the keeping of fame.\r\nMrs. Gaskell\xe2\x80\x99s touching and delightful task was ready for her, and\r\nAnne, no less than Charlotte and Emily, was sure of England\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nMARY A. WARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR\xe2\x80\x99S PREFACE[2]\r\nTO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I acknowledge the success of the present work to have been\r\ngreater than I anticipated, and the praises it has elicited from a few\r\nkind critics to have been greater than it deserved, I must also admit\r\nthat from some other quarters it has been censured with an asperity\r\nwhich I was as little prepared to expect, and which my judgment, as\r\nwell as my feelings, assures me is more bitter than just. It is\r\nscarcely the province of an author to refute the arguments of his\r\ncensors and vindicate his own productions; but I may be allowed to make\r\nhere a few observations with which I would have prefaced the first\r\nedition, had I foreseen the necessity of such precautions against the\r\nmisapprehensions of those who would read it with a prejudiced mind or\r\nbe content to judge it by a hasty glance.\r\n\r\nMy object in writing the following pages was not simply to amuse the\r\nReader; neither was it to gratify my own taste, nor yet to ingratiate\r\nmyself with the Press and the Public: I wished to tell the truth, for\r\ntruth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it.\r\nBut as the priceless treasure too frequently hides at the bottom of a\r\nwell, it needs some courage to dive for it, especially as he that does\r\nso will be likely to incur more scorn and obloquy for the mud and water\r\ninto which he has ventured to plunge, than thanks for the jewel he\r\nprocures; as, in like manner, she who undertakes the cleansing of a\r\ncareless bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s apartment will be liable to more abuse for the dust\r\nshe raises than commendation for the clearance she effects. Let it not\r\nbe imagined, however, that I consider myself competent to reform the\r\nerrors and abuses of society, but only that I would fain contribute my\r\nhumble quota towards so good an aim; and if I can gain the public ear\r\nat all, I would rather whisper a few wholesome truths therein than much\r\nsoft nonsense.\r\n\r\nAs the story of \xe2\x80\x9cAgnes Grey\xe2\x80\x9d was accused of extravagant over-colouring\r\nin those very parts that were carefully copied from the life, with a\r\nmost scrupulous avoidance of all exaggeration, so, in the present work,\r\nI find myself censured for depicting _con amore_, with \xe2\x80\x9ca morbid love\r\nof the coarse, if not of the brutal,\xe2\x80\x9d those scenes which, I will\r\nventure to say, have not been more painful for the most fastidious of\r\nmy critics to read than they were for me to describe. I may have gone\r\ntoo far; in which case I shall be careful not to trouble myself or my\r\nreaders in the same way again; but when we have to do with vice and\r\nvicious characters, I maintain it is better to depict them as they\r\nreally are than as they would wish to appear. To represent a bad thing\r\nin its least offensive light is, doubtless, the most agreeable course\r\nfor a writer of fiction to pursue; but is it the most honest, or the\r\nsafest? Is it better to reveal the snares and pitfalls of life to the\r\nyoung and thoughtless traveller, or to cover them with branches and\r\nflowers? Oh, reader! if there were less of this delicate concealment of\r\nfacts\xe2\x80\x94this whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cPeace, peace,\xe2\x80\x9d when there is no peace, there\r\nwould be less of sin and misery to the young of both sexes who are left\r\nto wring their bitter knowledge from experience.\r\n\r\nI would not be understood to suppose that the proceedings of the\r\nunhappy scapegrace, with his few profligate companions I have here\r\nintroduced, are a specimen of the common practices of society\xe2\x80\x94the case\r\nis an extreme one, as I trusted none would fail to perceive; but I know\r\nthat such characters do exist, and if I have warned one rash youth from\r\nfollowing in their steps, or prevented one thoughtless girl from\r\nfalling into the very natural error of my heroine, the book has not\r\nbeen written in vain. But, at the same time, if any honest reader shall\r\nhave derived more pain than pleasure from its perusal, and have closed\r\nthe last volume with a disagreeable impression on his mind, I humbly\r\ncrave his pardon, for such was far from my intention; and I will\r\nendeavour to do better another time, for I love to give innocent\r\npleasure. Yet, be it understood, I shall not limit my ambition to\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94or even to producing \xe2\x80\x9ca perfect work of art\xe2\x80\x9d: time and talents so\r\nspent, I should consider wasted and misapplied. Such humble talents as\r\nGod has given me I will endeavour to put to their greatest use; if I am\r\nable to amuse, I will try to benefit too; and when I feel it my duty to\r\nspeak an unpalatable truth, with the help of God, I _will_ speak it,\r\nthough it be to the prejudice of my name and to the detriment of my\r\nreader\xe2\x80\x99s immediate pleasure as well as my own.\r\n\r\nOne word more, and I have done. Respecting the author\xe2\x80\x99s identity, I\r\nwould have it to be distinctly understood that Acton Bell is neither\r\nCurrer nor Ellis Bell, and therefore let not his faults be attributed\r\nto them. As to whether the name be real or fictitious, it cannot\r\ngreatly signify to those who know him only by his works. As little, I\r\nshould think, can it matter whether the writer so designated is a man,\r\nor a woman, as one or two of my critics profess to have discovered. I\r\ntake the imputation in good part, as a compliment to the just\r\ndelineation of my female characters; and though I am bound to attribute\r\nmuch of the severity of my censors to this suspicion, I make no effort\r\nto refute it, because, in my own mind, I am satisfied that if a book is\r\na good one, it is so whatever the sex of the author may be. All novels\r\nare, or should be, written for both men and women to read, and I am at\r\na loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything\r\nthat would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be\r\ncensured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a\r\nman.\r\n\r\n_July_ 22_nd_, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must go back with me to the autumn of 1827.\r\n\r\nMy father, as you know, was a sort of gentleman farmer in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94shire; and\r\nI, by his express desire, succeeded him in the same quiet occupation,\r\nnot very willingly, for ambition urged me to higher aims, and\r\nself-conceit assured me that, in disregarding its voice, I was burying\r\nmy talent in the earth, and hiding my light under a bushel. My mother\r\nhad done her utmost to persuade me that I was capable of great\r\nachievements; but my father, who thought ambition was the surest road\r\nto ruin, and change but another word for destruction, would listen to\r\nno scheme for bettering either my own condition, or that of my fellow\r\nmortals. He assured me it was all rubbish, and exhorted me, with his\r\ndying breath, to continue in the good old way, to follow his steps, and\r\nthose of his father before him, and let my highest ambition be to walk\r\nhonestly through the world, looking neither to the right hand nor to\r\nthe left, and to transmit the paternal acres to my children in, at\r\nleast, as flourishing a condition as he left them to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x94an honest and industrious farmer is one of the most useful\r\nmembers of society; and if I devote my talents to the cultivation of my\r\nfarm, and the improvement of agriculture in general, I shall thereby\r\nbenefit, not only my own immediate connections and dependants, but, in\r\nsome degree, mankind at large:\xe2\x80\x94hence I shall not have lived in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith such reflections as these I was endeavouring to console myself, as\r\nI plodded home from the fields, one cold, damp, cloudy evening towards\r\nthe close of October. But the gleam of a bright red fire through the\r\nparlour window had more effect in cheering my spirits, and rebuking my\r\nthankless repinings, than all the sage reflections and good resolutions\r\nI had forced my mind to frame;\xe2\x80\x94for I was young then, remember\xe2\x80\x94only\r\nfour-and-twenty\xe2\x80\x94and had not acquired half the rule over my own spirit\r\nthat I now possess\xe2\x80\x94trifling as that may be.\r\n\r\nHowever, that haven of bliss must not be entered till I had exchanged\r\nmy miry boots for a clean pair of shoes, and my rough surtout for a\r\nrespectable coat, and made myself generally presentable before decent\r\nsociety; for my mother, with all her kindness, was vastly particular on\r\ncertain points.\r\n\r\nIn ascending to my room I was met upon the stairs by a smart, pretty\r\ngirl of nineteen, with a tidy, dumpy figure, a round face, bright,\r\nblooming cheeks, glossy, clustering curls, and little merry brown eyes.\r\nI need not tell you this was my sister Rose. She is, I know, a comely\r\nmatron still, and, doubtless, no less lovely\xe2\x80\x94in _your_ eyes\xe2\x80\x94than on the\r\nhappy day you first beheld her. Nothing told me then that she, a few\r\nyears hence, would be the wife of one entirely unknown to me as yet,\r\nbut destined hereafter to become a closer friend than even herself,\r\nmore intimate than that unmannerly lad of seventeen, by whom I was\r\ncollared in the passage, on coming down, and well-nigh jerked off my\r\nequilibrium, and who, in correction for his impudence, received a\r\nresounding whack over the sconce, which, however, sustained no serious\r\ninjury from the infliction; as, besides being more than commonly thick,\r\nit was protected by a redundant shock of short, reddish curls, that my\r\nmother called auburn.\r\n\r\nOn entering the parlour we found that honoured lady seated in her\r\narm-chair at the fireside, working away at her knitting, according to\r\nher usual custom, when she had nothing else to do. She had swept the\r\nhearth, and made a bright blazing fire for our reception; the servant\r\nhad just brought in the tea-tray; and Rose was producing the\r\nsugar-basin and tea-caddy from the cupboard in the black oak\r\nside-board, that shone like polished ebony, in the cheerful parlour\r\ntwilight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! here they both are,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my mother, looking round upon us\r\nwithout retarding the motion of her nimble fingers and glittering\r\nneedles. \xe2\x80\x9cNow shut the door, and come to the fire, while Rose gets the\r\ntea ready; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you must be starved;\xe2\x80\x94and tell me what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nabout all day;\xe2\x80\x94I like to know what my children have been about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been breaking in the grey colt\xe2\x80\x94no easy business that\xe2\x80\x94directing\r\nthe ploughing of the last wheat stubble\xe2\x80\x94for the ploughboy has not the\r\nsense to direct himself\xe2\x80\x94and carrying out a plan for the extensive and\r\nefficient draining of the low meadowlands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my brave boy!\xe2\x80\x94and Fergus, what have you been doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBadger-baiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here he proceeded to give a particular account of his sport, and\r\nthe respective traits of prowess evinced by the badger and the dogs; my\r\nmother pretending to listen with deep attention, and watching his\r\nanimated countenance with a degree of maternal admiration I thought\r\nhighly disproportioned to its object.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time you should be doing something else, Fergus,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as soon\r\nas a momentary pause in his narration allowed me to get in a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _can_ I do?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he; \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother won\xe2\x80\x99t let me go to sea or\r\nenter the army; and I\xe2\x80\x99m determined to do nothing else\xe2\x80\x94except make\r\nmyself such a nuisance to you all, that you will be thankful to get rid\r\nof me on any terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur parent soothingly stroked his stiff, short curls. He growled, and\r\ntried to look sulky, and then we all took our seats at the table, in\r\nobedience to the thrice-repeated summons of Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow take your tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what _I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ been\r\ndoing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to call on the Wilsons; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a _thousand_ pities\r\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t go with me, Gilbert, for Eliza Millward was there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! what of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing!\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell you about her;\xe2\x80\x94only that she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nnice, amusing little thing, when she is in a merry humour, and I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind calling her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush, my dear! your brother has no such idea!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered my\r\nmother earnestly, holding up her finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Rose; \xe2\x80\x9cI was going to tell you an important piece of\r\nnews I heard there\xe2\x80\x94I have been bursting with it ever since. You know it\r\nwas reported a month ago, that somebody was going to take Wildfell\r\nHall\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94what do you think? It has actually been inhabited above a\r\nweek!\xe2\x80\x94and we never knew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreposterous!!!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Fergus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has indeed!\xe2\x80\x94and by a single lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, my dear! The place is in ruins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has had two or three rooms made habitable; and there she lives,\r\nall alone\xe2\x80\x94except an old woman for a servant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! that spoils it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped she was a witch,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Fergus,\r\nwhile carving his inch-thick slice of bread and butter. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\r\nFergus! But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange! I can hardly believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you may believe it; for Jane Wilson has seen her. She went with\r\nher mother, who, of course, when she heard of a stranger being in the\r\nneighbourhood, would be on pins and needles till she had seen her and\r\ngot all she could out of her. She is called Mrs. Graham, and she is in\r\nmourning\xe2\x80\x94not widow\xe2\x80\x99s weeds, but slightish mourning\xe2\x80\x94and she is quite\r\nyoung, they say,\xe2\x80\x94not above five or six and twenty,\xe2\x80\x94but _so_ reserved!\r\nThey tried all they could to find out who she was and where she came\r\nfrom, and, all about her, but neither Mrs. Wilson, with her\r\npertinacious and impertinent home-thrusts, nor Miss Wilson, with her\r\nskilful man\xc5\x93uvring, could manage to elicit a single satisfactory\r\nanswer, or even a casual remark, or chance expression calculated to\r\nallay their curiosity, or throw the faintest ray of light upon her\r\nhistory, circumstances, or connections. Moreover, she was barely civil\r\nto them, and evidently better pleased to say \xe2\x80\x9cgood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9chow do\r\nyou do.\xe2\x80\x9d But Eliza Millward says her father intends to call upon her\r\nsoon, to offer some pastoral advice, which he fears she needs, as,\r\nthough she is known to have entered the neighbourhood early last week,\r\nshe did not make her appearance at church on Sunday; and she\xe2\x80\x94Eliza,\r\nthat is\xe2\x80\x94will beg to accompany him, and is sure _she_ can succeed in\r\nwheedling something out of her\xe2\x80\x94you know, Gilbert, _she_ can do\r\nanything. And _we_ should call some time, mamma; it\xe2\x80\x99s only proper, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my dear. Poor thing! How lonely she must feel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, be quick about it; and mind you bring me word how much sugar\r\nshe puts in her tea, and what sort of caps and aprons she wears, and\r\nall about it; for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I can live till I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFergus, very gravely.\r\n\r\nBut if he intended the speech to be hailed as a master-stroke of wit,\r\nhe signally failed, for nobody laughed. However, he was not much\r\ndisconcerted at that; for when he had taken a mouthful of bread and\r\nbutter and was about to swallow a gulp of tea, the humour of the thing\r\nburst upon him with such irresistible force, that he was obliged to\r\njump up from the table, and rush snorting and choking from the room;\r\nand a minute after, was heard screaming in fearful agony in the garden.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I was hungry, and contented myself with silently demolishing\r\nthe tea, ham, and toast, while my mother and sister went on talking,\r\nand continued to discuss the apparent or non-apparent circumstances,\r\nand probable or improbable history of the mysterious lady; but I must\r\nconfess that, after my brother\xe2\x80\x99s misadventure, I once or twice raised\r\nthe cup to my lips, and put it down again without daring to taste the\r\ncontents, lest I should injure my dignity by a similar explosion.\r\n\r\nThe next day my mother and Rose hastened to pay their compliments to\r\nthe fair recluse; and came back but little wiser than they went; though\r\nmy mother declared she did not regret the journey, for if she had not\r\ngained much good, she flattered herself she had imparted some, and that\r\nwas better: she had given some useful advice, which, she hoped, would\r\nnot be thrown away; for Mrs. Graham, though she said little to any\r\npurpose, and appeared somewhat self-opinionated, seemed not incapable\r\nof reflection,\xe2\x80\x94though she did not know where she had been all her life,\r\npoor thing, for she betrayed a lamentable ignorance on certain points,\r\nand had not even the sense to be ashamed of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what points, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn household matters, and all the little niceties of cookery, and such\r\nthings, that every lady ought to be familiar with, whether she be\r\nrequired to make a practical use of her knowledge or not. I gave her\r\nsome useful pieces of information, however, and several excellent\r\nreceipts, the value of which she evidently could not appreciate, for\r\nshe begged I would not trouble myself, as she lived in such a plain,\r\nquiet way, that she was sure she should never make use of them. \xe2\x80\x98No\r\nmatter, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98it is what every respectable female ought to\r\nknow;\xe2\x80\x94and besides, though you are alone now, you will not be always so;\r\nyou _have_ been married, and probably\xe2\x80\x94I might say almost certainly\xe2\x80\x94will\r\nbe again.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You are mistaken there, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, almost haughtily;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am certain I never shall.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94But I told her _I_ knew better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome romantic young widow, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9ccome there to end her\r\ndays in solitude, and mourn in secret for the dear departed\xe2\x80\x94but it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t last long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think not,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Rose; \xe2\x80\x9cfor she didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem _very_\r\ndisconsolate after all; and she\xe2\x80\x99s excessively pretty\xe2\x80\x94handsome\r\nrather\xe2\x80\x94you must see her, Gilbert; you will call her a perfect beauty,\r\nthough you could hardly pretend to discover a resemblance between her\r\nand Eliza Millward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can imagine many faces more beautiful than Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s, though not\r\nmore charming. I allow she has small claims to perfection; but then, I\r\nmaintain that, if she were more perfect, she would be less\r\ninteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you prefer her faults to other people\xe2\x80\x99s perfections?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so\xe2\x80\x94saving my mother\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear Gilbert, what nonsense you talk!\xe2\x80\x94I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s quite out of the question,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother, getting up, and\r\nbustling out of the room, under pretence of household business, in\r\norder to escape the contradiction that was trembling on my tongue.\r\n\r\nAfter that Rose favoured me with further particulars respecting Mrs.\r\nGraham. Her appearance, manners, and dress, and the very furniture of\r\nthe room she inhabited, were all set before me, with rather more\r\nclearness and precision than I cared to see them; but, as I was not a\r\nvery attentive listener, I could not repeat the description if I would.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Saturday; and, on Sunday, everybody wondered whether\r\nor not the fair unknown would profit by the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrance, and\r\ncome to church. I confess I looked with some interest myself towards\r\nthe old family pew, appertaining to Wildfell Hall, where the faded\r\ncrimson cushions and lining had been unpressed and unrenewed so many\r\nyears, and the grim escutcheons, with their lugubrious borders of rusty\r\nblack cloth, frowned so sternly from the wall above.\r\n\r\nAnd there I beheld a tall, lady-like figure, clad in black. Her face\r\nwas towards me, and there was something in it which, once seen, invited\r\nme to look again. Her hair was raven black, and disposed in long glossy\r\nringlets, a style of coiffure rather unusual in those days, but always\r\ngraceful and becoming; her complexion was clear and pale; her eyes I\r\ncould not see, for, being bent upon her prayer-book, they were\r\nconcealed by their drooping lids and long black lashes, but the brows\r\nabove were expressive and well defined; the forehead was lofty and\r\nintellectual, the nose, a perfect aquiline and the features, in\r\ngeneral, unexceptionable\xe2\x80\x94only there was a slight hollowness about the\r\ncheeks and eyes, and the lips, though finely formed, were a little too\r\nthin, a little too firmly compressed, and had something about them that\r\nbetokened, I thought, no very soft or amiable temper; and I said in my\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather admire you from this distance, fair lady, than be\r\nthe partner of your home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then she happened to raise her eyes, and they met mine; I did not\r\nchoose to withdraw my gaze, and she turned again to her book, but with\r\na momentary, indefinable expression of quiet scorn, that was\r\ninexpressibly provoking to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks me an impudent puppy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I. \xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x94she shall change\r\nher mind before long, if I think it worth while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut then it flashed upon me that these were very improper thoughts for\r\na place of worship, and that my behaviour, on the present occasion, was\r\nanything but what it ought to be. Previous, however, to directing my\r\nmind to the service, I glanced round the church to see if any one had\r\nbeen observing me;\xe2\x80\x94but no,\xe2\x80\x94all, who were not attending to their\r\nprayer-books, were attending to the strange lady,\xe2\x80\x94my good mother and\r\nsister among the rest, and Mrs. Wilson and her daughter; and even Eliza\r\nMillward was slily glancing from the corners of her eyes towards the\r\nobject of general attraction. Then she glanced at me, simpered a\r\nlittle, and blushed, modestly looked at her prayer-book, and\r\nendeavoured to compose her features.\r\n\r\nHere I was transgressing again; and this time I was made sensible of it\r\nby a sudden dig in the ribs, from the elbow of my pert brother. For the\r\npresent, I could only resent the insult by pressing my foot upon his\r\ntoes, deferring further vengeance till we got out of church.\r\n\r\nNow, Halford, before I close this letter, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you who Eliza\r\nMillward was: she was the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s younger daughter, and a very engaging\r\nlittle creature, for whom I felt no small degree of partiality;\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nknew it, though I had never come to any direct explanation, and had no\r\ndefinite intention of so doing, for my mother, who maintained there was\r\nno one good enough for me within twenty miles round, could not bear the\r\nthoughts of my marrying that insignificant little thing, who, in\r\naddition to her numerous other disqualifications, had not twenty pounds\r\nto call her own. Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s figure was at once slight and plump, her face\r\nsmall, and nearly as round as my sister\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x94complexion, something\r\nsimilar to hers, but more delicate and less decidedly blooming,\xe2\x80\x94nose,\r\n_retrouss\xc3\xa9_,\xe2\x80\x94features, generally irregular; and, altogether, she was\r\nrather charming than pretty. But her eyes\xe2\x80\x94I must not forget those\r\nremarkable features, for therein her chief attraction lay\xe2\x80\x94in outward\r\naspect at least;\xe2\x80\x94they were long and narrow in shape, the irids black,\r\nor very dark brown, the expression various, and ever changing, but\r\nalways either preternaturally\xe2\x80\x94I had almost said _diabolically_\xe2\x80\x94wicked,\r\nor irresistibly bewitching\xe2\x80\x94often both. Her voice was gentle and\r\nchildish, her tread light and soft as that of a cat:\xe2\x80\x94but her manners\r\nmore frequently resembled those of a pretty playful kitten, that is now\r\npert and roguish, now timid and demure, according to its own sweet\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nHer sister, Mary, was several years older, several inches taller, and\r\nof a larger, coarser build\xe2\x80\x94a plain, quiet, sensible girl, who had\r\npatiently nursed their mother, through her last long, tedious illness,\r\nand been the housekeeper, and family drudge, from thence to the present\r\ntime. She was trusted and valued by her father, loved and courted by\r\nall dogs, cats, children, and poor people, and slighted and neglected\r\nby everybody else.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Michael Millward himself was a tall, ponderous elderly\r\ngentleman, who placed a shovel hat above his large, square,\r\nmassive-featured face, carried a stout walking-stick in his hand, and\r\nincased his still powerful limbs in knee-breeches and gaiters,\xe2\x80\x94or black\r\nsilk stockings on state occasions. He was a man of fixed principles,\r\nstrong prejudices, and regular habits, intolerant of dissent in any\r\nshape, acting under a firm conviction that _his_ opinions were always\r\nright, and whoever differed from them must be either most deplorably\r\nignorant, or wilfully blind.\r\n\r\nIn childhood, I had always been accustomed to regard him with a feeling\r\nof reverential awe\xe2\x80\x94but lately, even now, surmounted, for, though he had\r\na fatherly kindness for the well-behaved, he was a strict\r\ndisciplinarian, and had often sternly reproved our juvenile failings\r\nand peccadilloes; and moreover, in those days, whenever he called upon\r\nour parents, we had to stand up before him, and say our catechism, or\r\nrepeat, \xe2\x80\x9cHow doth the little busy bee,\xe2\x80\x9d or some other hymn, or\xe2\x80\x94worse\r\nthan all\xe2\x80\x94be questioned about his last text, and the heads of the\r\ndiscourse, which we never could remember. Sometimes, the worthy\r\ngentleman would reprove my mother for being over-indulgent to her sons,\r\nwith a reference to old Eli, or David and Absalom, which was\r\nparticularly galling to her feelings; and, very highly as she respected\r\nhim, and all his sayings, I once heard her exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to goodness\r\nhe had a son himself! He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so ready with his advice to other\r\npeople then;\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99d see what it is to have a couple of boys to keep in\r\norder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a laudable care for his own bodily health\xe2\x80\x94kept very early hours,\r\nregularly took a walk before breakfast, was vastly particular about\r\nwarm and dry clothing, had never been known to preach a sermon without\r\npreviously swallowing a raw egg\xe2\x80\x94albeit he was gifted with good lungs\r\nand a powerful voice,\xe2\x80\x94and was, generally, extremely particular about\r\nwhat he ate and drank, though by no means abstemious, and having a mode\r\nof dietary peculiar to himself,\xe2\x80\x94being a great despiser of tea and such\r\nslops, and a patron of malt liquors, bacon and eggs, ham, hung beef,\r\nand other strong meats, which agreed well enough with his digestive\r\norgans, and therefore were maintained by him to be good and wholesome\r\nfor everybody, and confidently recommended to the most delicate\r\nconvalescents or dyspeptics, who, if they failed to derive the promised\r\nbenefit from his prescriptions, were told it was because they had not\r\npersevered, and if they complained of inconvenient results therefrom,\r\nwere assured it was all fancy.\r\n\r\nI will just touch upon two other persons whom I have mentioned, and\r\nthen bring this long letter to a close. These are Mrs. Wilson and her\r\ndaughter. The former was the widow of a substantial farmer, a\r\nnarrow-minded, tattling old gossip, whose character is not worth\r\ndescribing. She had two sons, Robert, a rough countrified farmer, and\r\nRichard, a retiring, studious young man, who was studying the classics\r\nwith the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, preparing for college, with a view to\r\nenter the church.\r\n\r\nTheir sister Jane was a young lady of some talents, and more ambition.\r\nShe had, at her own desire, received a regular boarding-school\r\neducation, superior to what any member of the family had obtained\r\nbefore. She had taken the polish well, acquired considerable elegance\r\nof manners, quite lost her provincial accent, and could boast of more\r\naccomplishments than the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s daughters. She was considered a beauty\r\nbesides; but never for a moment could she number me amongst her\r\nadmirers. She was about six and twenty, rather tall and very slender,\r\nher hair was neither chestnut nor auburn, but a most decided bright,\r\nlight red; her complexion was remarkably fair and brilliant, her head\r\nsmall, neck long, chin well turned, but very short, lips thin and red,\r\neyes clear hazel, quick, and penetrating, but entirely destitute of\r\npoetry or feeling. She had, or might have had, many suitors in her own\r\nrank of life, but scornfully repulsed or rejected them all; for none\r\nbut a gentleman could please her refined taste, and none but a rich one\r\ncould satisfy her soaring ambition. One gentleman there was, from whom\r\nshe had lately received some rather pointed attentions, and upon whose\r\nheart, name, and fortune, it was whispered, she had serious designs.\r\nThis was Mr. Lawrence, the young squire, whose family had formerly\r\noccupied Wildfell Hall, but had deserted it, some fifteen years ago,\r\nfor a more modern and commodious mansion in the neighbouring parish.\r\n\r\nNow, Halford, I bid you adieu for the present. This is the first\r\ninstalment of my debt. If the coin suits you, tell me so, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send\r\nyou the rest at my leisure: if you would rather remain my creditor than\r\nstuff your purse with such ungainly, heavy pieces,\xe2\x80\x94tell me still, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll pardon your bad taste, and willingly keep the treasure to myself.\r\n\r\nYours immutably,\r\nGILBERT MARKHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nI perceive, with joy, my most valued friend, that the cloud of your\r\ndispleasure has passed away; the light of your countenance blesses me\r\nonce more, and you desire the continuation of my story: therefore,\r\nwithout more ado, you shall have it.\r\n\r\nI think the day I last mentioned was a certain Sunday, the latest in\r\nthe October of 1827. On the following Tuesday I was out with my dog and\r\ngun, in pursuit of such game as I could find within the territory of\r\nLinden-Car; but finding none at all, I turned my arms against the hawks\r\nand carrion crows, whose depredations, as I suspected, had deprived me\r\nof better prey. To this end I left the more frequented regions, the\r\nwooded valleys, the corn-fields, and the meadow-lands, and proceeded to\r\nmount the steep acclivity of Wildfell, the wildest and the loftiest\r\neminence in our neighbourhood, where, as you ascend, the hedges, as\r\nwell as the trees, become scanty and stunted, the former, at length,\r\ngiving place to rough stone fences, partly greened over with ivy and\r\nmoss, the latter to larches and Scotch fir-trees, or isolated\r\nblackthorns. The fields, being rough and stony, and wholly unfit for\r\nthe plough, were mostly devoted to the pasturing of sheep and cattle;\r\nthe soil was thin and poor: bits of grey rock here and there peeped out\r\nfrom the grassy hillocks; bilberry-plants and heather\xe2\x80\x94relics of more\r\nsavage wildness\xe2\x80\x94grew under the walls; and in many of the enclosures,\r\nragweeds and rushes usurped supremacy over the scanty herbage; but\r\nthese were not _my_ property.\r\n\r\nNear the top of this hill, about two miles from Linden-Car, stood\r\nWildfell Hall, a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era, built of\r\ndark grey stone, venerable and picturesque to look at, but doubtless,\r\ncold and gloomy enough to inhabit, with its thick stone mullions and\r\nlittle latticed panes, its time-eaten air-holes, and its too lonely,\r\ntoo unsheltered situation,\xe2\x80\x94only shielded from the war of wind and\r\nweather by a group of Scotch firs, themselves half blighted with\r\nstorms, and looking as stern and gloomy as the Hall itself. Behind it\r\nlay a few desolate fields, and then the brown heath-clad summit of the\r\nhill; before it (enclosed by stone walls, and entered by an iron gate,\r\nwith large balls of grey granite\xe2\x80\x94similar to those which decorated the\r\nroof and gables\xe2\x80\x94surmounting the gate-posts) was a garden,\xe2\x80\x94once stocked\r\nwith such hard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and\r\nclimate, and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntorturing shears, and most readily assume the shapes he chose to give\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x94now, having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed,\r\nabandoned to the weeds and the grass, to the frost and the wind, the\r\nrain and the drought, it presented a very singular appearance indeed.\r\nThe close green walls of privet, that had bordered the principal walk,\r\nwere two-thirds withered away, and the rest grown beyond all reasonable\r\nbounds; the old boxwood swan, that sat beside the scraper, had lost its\r\nneck and half its body: the castellated towers of laurel in the middle\r\nof the garden, the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the\r\ngateway, and the lion that guarded the other, were sprouted into such\r\nfantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth, or in\r\nthe waters under the earth; but, to my young imagination, they\r\npresented all of them a goblinish appearance, that harmonised well with\r\nthe ghostly legions and dark traditions our old nurse had told us\r\nrespecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI had succeeded in killing a hawk and two crows when I came within\r\nsight of the mansion; and then, relinquishing further depredations, I\r\nsauntered on, to have a look at the old place, and see what changes had\r\nbeen wrought in it by its new inhabitant. I did not like to go quite to\r\nthe front and stare in at the gate; but I paused beside the garden\r\nwall, and looked, and saw no change\xe2\x80\x94except in one wing, where the\r\nbroken windows and dilapidated roof had evidently been repaired, and\r\nwhere a thin wreath of smoke was curling up from the stack of chimneys.\r\n\r\nWhile I thus stood, leaning on my gun, and looking up at the dark\r\ngables, sunk in an idle reverie, weaving a tissue of wayward fancies,\r\nin which old associations and the fair young hermit, now within those\r\nwalls, bore a nearly equal part, I heard a slight rustling and\r\nscrambling just within the garden; and, glancing in the direction\r\nwhence the sound proceeded, I beheld a tiny hand elevated above the\r\nwall: it clung to the topmost stone, and then another little hand was\r\nraised to take a firmer hold, and then appeared a small white forehead,\r\nsurmounted with wreaths of light brown hair, with a pair of deep blue\r\neyes beneath, and the upper portion of a diminutive ivory nose.\r\n\r\nThe eyes did not notice me, but sparkled with glee on beholding Sancho,\r\nmy beautiful black and white setter, that was coursing about the field\r\nwith its muzzle to the ground. The little creature raised its face and\r\ncalled aloud to the dog. The good-natured animal paused, looked up, and\r\nwagged his tail, but made no further advances. The child (a little boy,\r\napparently about five years old) scrambled up to the top of the wall,\r\nand called again and again; but finding this of no avail, apparently\r\nmade up his mind, like Mahomet, to go to the mountain, since the\r\nmountain would not come to him, and attempted to get over; but a\r\ncrabbed old cherry-tree, that grew hard by, caught him by the frock in\r\none of its crooked scraggy arms that stretched over the wall. In\r\nattempting to disengage himself his foot slipped, and down he\r\ntumbled\xe2\x80\x94but not to the earth;\xe2\x80\x94the tree still kept him suspended. There\r\nwas a silent struggle, and then a piercing shriek;\xe2\x80\x94but, in an instant,\r\nI had dropped my gun on the grass, and caught the little fellow in my\r\narms.\r\n\r\nI wiped his eyes with his frock, told him he was all right and called\r\nSancho to pacify him. He was just putting little hand on the dog\xe2\x80\x99s neck\r\nand beginning to smile through his tears, when I heard behind me a\r\nclick of the iron gate, and a rustle of female garments, and lo! Mrs.\r\nGraham darted upon me\xe2\x80\x94her neck uncovered, her black locks streaming in\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the child!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a voice scarce louder than a whisper,\r\nbut with a tone of startling vehemence, and, seizing the boy, she\r\nsnatched him from me, as if some dire contamination were in my touch,\r\nand then stood with one hand firmly clasping his, the other on his\r\nshoulder, fixing upon me her large, luminous dark eyes\xe2\x80\x94pale,\r\nbreathless, quivering with agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not harming the child, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, scarce knowing whether to\r\nbe most astonished or displeased; \xe2\x80\x9che was tumbling off the wall there;\r\nand I was so fortunate as to catch him, while he hung suspended\r\nheadlong from that tree, and prevent I know not what catastrophe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered she;\xe2\x80\x94suddenly calming down,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlight of reason seeming to break upon her beclouded spirit, and a faint\r\nblush mantling on her cheek\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know you;\xe2\x80\x94and I thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stooped to kiss the child, and fondly clasped her arm round his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought I was going to kidnap your son, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stroked his head with a half-embarrassed laugh, and replied,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI did\r\nnot know he had attempted to climb the wall.\xe2\x80\x94I have the pleasure of\r\naddressing Mr. Markham, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, somewhat abruptly.\r\n\r\nI bowed, but ventured to ask how she knew me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister called here, a few days ago, with Mrs. Markham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the resemblance so strong then?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, in some surprise, and not\r\nso greatly flattered at the idea as I ought to have been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a likeness about the eyes and complexion I think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nshe, somewhat dubiously surveying my face;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I think I saw you at\r\nchurch on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI smiled.\xe2\x80\x94There was something either in that smile or the recollections\r\nit awakened that was particularly displeasing to her, for she suddenly\r\nassumed again that proud, chilly look that had so unspeakably roused my\r\naversion at church\xe2\x80\x94a look of repellent scorn, so easily assumed, and so\r\nentirely without the least distortion of a single feature, that, while\r\nthere, it seemed like the natural expression of the face, and was the\r\nmore provoking to me, because I could not think it affected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; and without another word or\r\nglance, she withdrew, with her child, into the garden; and I returned\r\nhome, angry and dissatisfied\xe2\x80\x94I could scarcely tell you why, and\r\ntherefore will not attempt it.\r\n\r\nI only stayed to put away my gun and powder-horn, and give some\r\nrequisite directions to one of the farming-men, and then repaired to\r\nthe vicarage, to solace my spirit and soothe my ruffled temper with the\r\ncompany and conversation of Eliza Millward.\r\n\r\nI found her, as usual, busy with some piece of soft embroidery (the\r\nmania for Berlin wools had not yet commenced), while her sister was\r\nseated at the chimney-corner, with the cat on her knee, mending a heap\r\nof stockings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xe2\x80\x94Mary! put them away!\xe2\x80\x9d Eliza was hastily saying, just as I entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d was the phlegmatic reply; and my appearance prevented\r\nfurther discussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so unfortunate, Mr. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the younger sister, with\r\none of her arch, sidelong glances. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa\xe2\x80\x99s just gone out into the\r\nparish, and not likely to be back for an hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; I can manage to spend a few minutes with his daughters, if\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, bringing a chair to the fire, and seating\r\nmyself therein, without waiting to be asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very good and amusing, we shall not object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your permission be unconditional, pray; for I came not to give\r\npleasure, but to seek it,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\nHowever, I thought it but reasonable to make some slight exertion to\r\nrender my company agreeable; and what little effort I made, was\r\napparently pretty successful, for Miss Eliza was never in a better\r\nhumour. We seemed, indeed, to be mutually pleased with each other, and\r\nmanaged to maintain between us a cheerful and animated though not very\r\nprofound conversation. It was little better than a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_, for\r\nMiss Millward never opened her lips, except occasionally to correct\r\nsome random assertion or exaggerated expression of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nonce to ask her to pick up the ball of cotton that had rolled under the\r\ntable. I did this myself, however, as in duty bound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as I presented it to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\nhave picked it up myself; only I did not want to disturb the cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, dear, _that_ won\xe2\x80\x99t excuse you in Mr. Markham\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEliza; \xe2\x80\x9che hates cats, I daresay, as cordially as he does old\r\nmaids\xe2\x80\x94like all other gentlemen. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr. Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it is natural for our unamiable sex to dislike the\r\ncreatures,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I; \xe2\x80\x9cfor you ladies lavish so many caresses upon\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless them\xe2\x80\x94little darlings!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, in a sudden burst of\r\nenthusiasm, turning round and overwhelming her sister\xe2\x80\x99s pet with a\r\nshower of kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Eliza!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Millward, somewhat gruffly, as she\r\nimpatiently pushed her away.\r\n\r\nBut it was time for me to be going: make what haste I would, I should\r\nstill be too late for tea; and my mother was the soul of order and\r\npunctuality.\r\n\r\nMy fair friend was evidently unwilling to bid me adieu. I tenderly\r\nsqueezed her little hand at parting; and she repaid me with one of her\r\nsoftest smiles and most bewitching glances. I went home very happy,\r\nwith a heart brimful of complacency for myself, and overflowing with\r\nlove for Eliza.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after, Mrs. Graham called at Linden-Car, contrary to the\r\nexpectation of Rose, who entertained an idea that the mysterious\r\noccupant of Wildfell Hall would wholly disregard the common observances\r\nof civilized life,\xe2\x80\x94in which opinion she was supported by the Wilsons,\r\nwho testified that neither their call nor the Millwards\xe2\x80\x99 had been\r\nreturned as yet. Now, however, the cause of that omission was\r\nexplained, though not entirely to the satisfaction of Rose. Mrs. Graham\r\nhad brought her child with her, and on my mother\xe2\x80\x99s expressing surprise\r\nthat he could walk so far, she replied,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long walk for him; but\r\nI must have either taken him with me, or relinquished the visit\r\naltogether; for I never leave him alone; and I think, Mrs. Markham, I\r\nmust beg you to make my excuses to the Millwards and Mrs. Wilson, when\r\nyou see them, as I fear I cannot do myself the pleasure of calling upon\r\nthem till my little Arthur is able to accompany me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have a servant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose; \xe2\x80\x9ccould you not leave him with\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has her own occupations to attend to; and besides, she is too old\r\nto run after a child, and he is too mercurial to be tied to an elderly\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you left him to come to church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, once; but I would not have left him for any other purpose; and I\r\nthink, in future, I must contrive to bring him with me, or stay at\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he so mischievous?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my mother, considerably shocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady, sadly smiling, as she stroked the wavy locks of\r\nher son, who was seated on a low stool at her feet; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he is my only\r\ntreasure, and I am his only friend: so we don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be separated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, I call that doting,\xe2\x80\x9d said my plain-spoken parent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshould try to suppress such foolish fondness, as well to save your son\r\nfrom ruin as yourself from ridicule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ruin!_ Mrs. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it is spoiling the child. Even at _his_ age, he ought not to be\r\nalways tied to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s apron-string; he should learn to be ashamed\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Markham, I beg you will not say such things, in _his_ presence,\r\nat least. I trust my son will _never_ be ashamed to love his mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Graham, with a serious energy that startled the company.\r\n\r\nMy mother attempted to appease her by an explanation; but she seemed to\r\nthink enough had been said on the subject, and abruptly turned the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s temper is none of\r\nthe mildest, notwithstanding her sweet, pale face and lofty brow, where\r\nthought and suffering seem equally to have stamped their impress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this time I was seated at a table on the other side of the room,\r\napparently immersed in the perusal of a volume of the _Farmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMagazine_, which I happened to have been reading at the moment of our\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s arrival; and, not choosing to be over civil, I had merely\r\nbowed as she entered, and continued my occupation as before.\r\n\r\nIn a little while, however, I was sensible that some one was\r\napproaching me, with a light, but slow and hesitating tread. It was\r\nlittle Arthur, irresistibly attracted by my dog Sancho, that was lying\r\nat my feet. On looking up I beheld him standing about two yards off,\r\nwith his clear blue eyes wistfully gazing on the dog, transfixed to the\r\nspot, not by fear of the animal, but by a timid disinclination to\r\napproach its master. A little encouragement, however, induced him to\r\ncome forward. The child, though shy, was not sullen. In a minute he was\r\nkneeling on the carpet, with his arms round Sancho\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and, in a\r\nminute or two more, the little fellow was seated on my knee, surveying\r\nwith eager interest the various specimens of horses, cattle, pigs, and\r\nmodel farms portrayed in the volume before me. I glanced at his mother\r\nnow and then to see how she relished the new-sprung intimacy; and I\r\nsaw, by the unquiet aspect of her eye, that for some reason or other\r\nshe was uneasy at the child\xe2\x80\x99s position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, at length, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here. You are troublesome to Mr.\r\nMarkham: he wishes to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means, Mrs. Graham; pray let him stay. I am as much amused as he\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded I. But still, with hand and eye, she silently called him\r\nto her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child; \xe2\x80\x9clet me look at these pictures first; and\r\nthen I\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and tell you all about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have a small party on Monday, the fifth of November,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid my mother; \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope you will not refuse to make one, Mrs.\r\nGraham. You can bring your little boy with you, you know\xe2\x80\x94I daresay we\r\nshall be able to amuse him;\xe2\x80\x94and then you can make your own apologies to\r\nthe Millwards and Wilsons\xe2\x80\x94they will all be here, I expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, I never go to parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but this will be quite a family concern\xe2\x80\x94early hours, and nobody\r\nhere but ourselves, and just the Millwards and Wilsons, most of whom\r\nyou already know, and Mr. Lawrence, your landlord, with whom you ought\r\nto make acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do know something of him\xe2\x80\x94but you must excuse me this time; for the\r\nevenings, now, are dark and damp, and Arthur, I fear, is too delicate\r\nto risk exposure to their influence with impunity. We must defer the\r\nenjoyment of your hospitality till the return of longer days and warmer\r\nnights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose, now, at a hint from my mother, produced a decanter of wine, with\r\naccompaniments of glasses and cake, from the cupboard and the oak\r\nsideboard, and the refreshment was duly presented to the guests. They\r\nboth partook of the cake, but obstinately refused the wine, in spite of\r\ntheir hostess\xe2\x80\x99s hospitable attempts to force it upon them. Arthur,\r\nespecially shrank from the ruby nectar as if in terror and disgust, and\r\nwas ready to cry when urged to take it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mamma; \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Markham thinks it will do\r\nyou good, as you were tired with your walk; but she will not oblige you\r\nto take it!\xe2\x80\x94I daresay you will do very well without. He detests the\r\nvery sight of wine,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cand the smell of it almost makes him\r\nsick. I have been accustomed to make him swallow a little wine or weak\r\nspirits-and-water, by way of medicine, when he was sick, and, in fact,\r\nI have done what I could to make him hate them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed, except the young widow and her son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Graham,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother, wiping the tears of merriment from\r\nher bright blue eyes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwell, you surprise me! I really gave you credit\r\nfor having more sense.\xe2\x80\x94The poor child will be the veriest milksop that\r\never was sopped! Only think what a man you will make of him, if you\r\npersist in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it a very excellent plan,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mrs. Graham, with\r\nimperturbable gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cBy that means I hope to save him from one\r\ndegrading vice at least. I wish I could render the incentives to every\r\nother equally innoxious in his case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut by such means,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will never render him virtuous.\xe2\x80\x94What\r\nis it that constitutes virtue, Mrs. Graham? Is it the circumstance of\r\nbeing able and willing to resist temptation; or that of having no\r\ntemptations to resist?\xe2\x80\x94Is he a strong man that overcomes great\r\nobstacles and performs surprising achievements, though by dint of great\r\nmuscular exertion, and at the risk of some subsequent fatigue, or he\r\nthat sits in his chair all day, with nothing to do more laborious than\r\nstirring the fire, and carrying his food to his mouth? If you would\r\nhave your son to walk honourably through the world, you must not\r\nattempt to clear the stones from his path, but teach him to walk firmly\r\nover them\xe2\x80\x94not insist upon leading him by the hand, but let him learn to\r\ngo alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will lead him by the hand, Mr. Markham, till he has strength to go\r\nalone; and I will clear as many stones from his path as I can, and\r\nteach him to avoid the _rest_\xe2\x80\x94or walk firmly over them, as you say;\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nwhen I have done my utmost, in the way of clearance, there will still\r\nbe plenty left to exercise all the agility, steadiness, and\r\ncircumspection he will ever have.\xe2\x80\x94It is all very well to talk about\r\nnoble resistance, and trials of virtue; but for fifty\xe2\x80\x94or five hundred\r\nmen that have yielded to temptation, show me one that has had virtue to\r\nresist. And why should I take it for granted that my son will be one in\r\na thousand?\xe2\x80\x94and not rather prepare for the worst, and suppose he will\r\nbe like his\xe2\x80\x94like the rest of mankind, unless I take care to prevent\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very complimentary to us all,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about _you_\xe2\x80\x94I speak of those I do know\xe2\x80\x94and when I see\r\nthe whole race of mankind (with a few rare exceptions) stumbling and\r\nblundering along the path of life, sinking into every pitfall, and\r\nbreaking their shins over every impediment that lies in their way,\r\nshall I not use all the means in my power to insure for him a smoother\r\nand a safer passage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but the surest means will be to endeavour to fortify him\r\n_against_ temptation, not to remove it out of his way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do both, Mr. Markham. God knows he will have temptations enough\r\nto assail him, both from within and without, when I have done all I can\r\nto render vice as uninviting to him, as it is abominable in its own\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x94I myself have had, indeed, but few incentives to what the world\r\ncalls vice, but yet I have experienced temptations and trials of\r\nanother kind, that have required, on many occasions, more watchfulness\r\nand firmness to resist than I have hitherto been able to muster against\r\nthem. And this, I believe, is what most others would acknowledge who\r\nare accustomed to reflection, and wishful to strive against their\r\nnatural corruptions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother, but half apprehending her drift; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you would\r\nnot judge of a boy by yourself\xe2\x80\x94and, my dear Mrs. Graham, let me warn\r\nyou in good time against the error\xe2\x80\x94the fatal error, I may call it\xe2\x80\x94of\r\ntaking that boy\xe2\x80\x99s education upon yourself. Because you are clever in\r\nsome things and well informed, you may fancy yourself equal to the\r\ntask; but indeed you are not; and if you persist in the attempt,\r\nbelieve me you will bitterly repent it when the mischief is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to send him to school, I suppose, to learn to despise his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s authority and affection!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, with rather a bitter\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _no!_\xe2\x80\x94But if you would have a boy to despise his mother, let her\r\nkeep him at home, and spend her life in petting him up, and slaving to\r\nindulge his follies and caprices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perfectly agree with you, Mrs. Markham; but nothing can be further\r\nfrom my principles and practice than such criminal weakness as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you will treat him like a girl\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil his spirit, and\r\nmake a mere Miss Nancy of him\xe2\x80\x94you will, indeed, Mrs. Graham, whatever\r\nyou may think. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll get Mr. Millward to talk to you about\r\nit:\xe2\x80\x94_he\xe2\x80\x99ll_ tell you the consequences;\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll set it before you as plain\r\nas the day;\xe2\x80\x94and tell you what you ought to do, and all about it;\xe2\x80\x94and, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t doubt, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to convince you in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo occasion to trouble the vicar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Graham, glancing at me\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsuppose I was smiling at my mother\xe2\x80\x99s unbounded confidence in that\r\nworthy gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Markham here thinks his powers of conviction at\r\nleast equal to Mr. Millward\xe2\x80\x99s. If I hear not him, neither should I be\r\nconvinced though one rose from the dead, he would tell you. Well, Mr.\r\nMarkham, you that maintain that a boy should not be shielded from evil,\r\nbut sent out to battle against it, alone and unassisted\xe2\x80\x94not taught to\r\navoid the snares of life, but boldly to rush into them, or over them,\r\nas he may\xe2\x80\x94to seek danger, rather than shun it, and feed his virtue by\r\ntemptation,\xe2\x80\x94would you\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x94but you get on too fast. I have not yet\r\nsaid that a boy should be taught to rush into the snares of life,\xe2\x80\x94or\r\neven wilfully to seek temptation for the sake of exercising his virtue\r\nby overcoming it;\xe2\x80\x94I only say that it is better to arm and strengthen\r\nyour hero, than to disarm and enfeeble the foe;\xe2\x80\x94and if you were to rear\r\nan oak sapling in a hothouse, tending it carefully night and day, and\r\nshielding it from every breath of wind, you could not expect it to\r\nbecome a hardy tree, like that which has grown up on the mountain-side,\r\nexposed to all the action of the elements, and not even sheltered from\r\nthe shock of the tempest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted;\xe2\x80\x94but would you use the same argument with regard to a girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you would have her to be tenderly and delicately nurtured, like a\r\nhot-house plant\xe2\x80\x94taught to cling to others for direction and support,\r\nand guarded, as much as possible, from the very knowledge of evil. But\r\nwill you be so good as to inform me why you make this distinction? Is\r\nit that you think she _has_ no virtue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you affirm that virtue is only elicited by temptation;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyou think that a woman cannot be too little exposed to temptation, or\r\ntoo little acquainted with vice, or anything connected therewith. It\r\n_must_ be either that you think she is essentially so vicious, or so\r\nfeeble-minded, that she _cannot_ withstand temptation,\xe2\x80\x94and though she\r\nmay be pure and innocent as long as she is kept in ignorance and\r\nrestraint, yet, being destitute of _real_ virtue, to teach her how to\r\nsin is at once to make her a sinner, and the greater her knowledge, the\r\nwider her liberty, the deeper will be her depravity,\xe2\x80\x94whereas, in the\r\nnobler sex, there is a natural tendency to goodness, guarded by a\r\nsuperior fortitude, which, the more it is exercised by trials and\r\ndangers, is only the further developed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid that I should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted her at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it must be that you think they are _both_ weak and prone\r\nto err, and the slightest error, the merest shadow of pollution, will\r\nruin the one, while the character of the other will be strengthened and\r\nembellished\xe2\x80\x94his education properly finished by a little practical\r\nacquaintance with forbidden things. Such experience, to him (to use a\r\ntrite simile), will be like the storm to the oak, which, though it may\r\nscatter the leaves, and snap the smaller branches, serves but to rivet\r\nthe roots, and to harden and condense the fibres of the tree. You would\r\nhave us encourage our sons to prove all things by their own experience,\r\nwhile our daughters must not even profit by the experience of others.\r\nNow _I_ would have both so to benefit by the experience of others, and\r\nthe precepts of a higher authority, that they should know beforehand to\r\nrefuse the evil and choose the good, and require no experimental proofs\r\nto teach them the evil of transgression. I would not send a poor girl\r\ninto the world, unarmed against her foes, and ignorant of the snares\r\nthat beset her path; nor would I watch and guard her, till, deprived of\r\nself-respect and self-reliance, she lost the power or the will to watch\r\nand guard herself;\xe2\x80\x94and as for my son\xe2\x80\x94if I thought he would grow up to\r\nbe what you call a man of the world\xe2\x80\x94one that has \xe2\x80\x98_seen life_,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nglories in his experience, even though he should so far profit by it as\r\nto sober down, at length, into a useful and respected member of\r\nsociety\xe2\x80\x94I would rather that he died to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x94rather a thousand\r\ntimes!\xe2\x80\x9d she earnestly repeated, pressing her darling to her side and\r\nkissing his forehead with intense affection. He had already left his\r\nnew companion, and been standing for some time beside his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknee, looking up into her face, and listening in silent wonder to her\r\nincomprehensible discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! you ladies must always have the last word, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said I,\r\nobserving her rise, and begin to take leave of my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may have as many words as you please,\xe2\x80\x94only I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay to hear\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; that is the way: you hear just as much of an argument as you\r\nplease; and the rest may be spoken to the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are anxious to say anything more on the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she,\r\nas she shook hands with Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must bring your sister to see me\r\nsome fine day, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll listen, as patiently as you could wish, to\r\nwhatever you please to say. I would rather be lectured by you than the\r\nvicar, because I should have less remorse in telling you, at the end of\r\nthe discourse, that I preserve my own opinion precisely the same as at\r\nthe beginning\xe2\x80\x94as would be the case, I am persuaded, with regard to\r\neither logician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, determined to be as provoking as herself;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor when a lady does consent to listen to an argument against her own\r\nopinions, she is always predetermined to withstand it\xe2\x80\x94to listen only\r\nwith her bodily ears, keeping the mental organs resolutely closed\r\nagainst the strongest reasoning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said my fair antagonist, with a pitying\r\nsmile; and deigning no further rejoinder, she slightly bowed, and was\r\nabout to withdraw; but her son, with childish impertinence, arrested\r\nher by exclaiming,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, you have not shaken hands with Mr. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughingly turned round and held out her hand. I gave it a spiteful\r\nsqueeze, for I was annoyed at the continual injustice she had done me\r\nfrom the very dawn of our acquaintance. Without knowing anything about\r\nmy real disposition and principles, she was evidently prejudiced\r\nagainst me, and seemed bent upon showing me that her opinions\r\nrespecting me, on every particular, fell far below those I entertained\r\nof myself. I was naturally touchy, or it would not have vexed me so\r\nmuch. Perhaps, too, I was a little bit spoiled by my mother and sister,\r\nand some other ladies of my acquaintance;\xe2\x80\x94and yet I was by no means a\r\nfop\xe2\x80\x94of that I am fully convinced, whether _you_ are or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOur party, on the 5th of November, passed off very well, in spite of\r\nMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to grace it with her presence. Indeed, it is\r\nprobable that, had she been there, there would have been less\r\ncordiality, freedom, and frolic amongst us than there was without her.\r\n\r\nMy mother, as usual, was cheerful and chatty, full of activity and\r\ngood-nature, and only faulty in being too anxious to make her guests\r\nhappy, thereby forcing several of them to do what their soul abhorred\r\nin the way of eating or drinking, sitting opposite the blazing fire, or\r\ntalking when they would be silent. Nevertheless, they bore it very\r\nwell, being all in their holiday humours.\r\n\r\nMr. Millward was mighty in important dogmas and sententious jokes,\r\npompous anecdotes and oracular discourses, dealt out for the\r\nedification of the whole assembly in general, and of the admiring Mrs.\r\nMarkham, the polite Mr. Lawrence, the sedate Mary Millward, the quiet\r\nRichard Wilson, and the matter-of-fact Robert in particular,\xe2\x80\x94as being\r\nthe most attentive listeners.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson was more brilliant than ever, with her budgets of fresh\r\nnews and old scandal, strung together with trivial questions and\r\nremarks, and oft-repeated observations, uttered apparently for the sole\r\npurpose of denying a moment\xe2\x80\x99s rest to her inexhaustible organs of\r\nspeech. She had brought her knitting with her, and it seemed as if her\r\ntongue had laid a wager with her fingers, to outdo them in swift and\r\nceaseless motion.\r\n\r\nHer daughter Jane was, of course, as graceful and elegant, as witty and\r\nseductive, as she could possibly manage to be; for here were all the\r\nladies to outshine, and all the gentlemen to charm,\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Lawrence,\r\nespecially, to capture and subdue. Her little arts to effect his\r\nsubjugation were too subtle and impalpable to attract my observation;\r\nbut I thought there was a certain _refined_ affectation of superiority,\r\nand an ungenial self-consciousness about her, that negatived all her\r\nadvantages; and after she was gone, Rose interpreted to me her various\r\nlooks, words, and actions with a mingled acuteness and asperity that\r\nmade me wonder, equally, at the lady\xe2\x80\x99s artifice and my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npenetration, and ask myself if she too had an eye to the squire\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nnever mind, Halford; she had not.\r\n\r\nRichard Wilson, Jane\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother, sat in a corner, apparently\r\ngood-tempered, but silent and shy, desirous to escape observation, but\r\nwilling enough to listen and observe: and, although somewhat out of his\r\nelement, he would have been happy enough in his own quiet way, if my\r\nmother could only have let him alone; but in her mistaken kindness, she\r\nwould keep persecuting him with her attentions\xe2\x80\x94pressing upon him all\r\nmanner of viands, under the notion that he was too bashful to help\r\nhimself, and obliging him to shout across the room his monosyllabic\r\nreplies to the numerous questions and observations by which she vainly\r\nattempted to draw him into conversation.\r\n\r\nRose informed me that he never would have favoured us with his company\r\nbut for the importunities of his sister Jane, who was most anxious to\r\nshow Mr. Lawrence that she had at least one brother more gentlemanly\r\nand refined than Robert. That worthy individual she had been equally\r\nsolicitous to keep away; but he affirmed that he saw no reason why he\r\nshould not enjoy a crack with Markham and the old lady (my mother was\r\nnot old, really), and bonny Miss Rose and the parson, as well as the\r\nbest;\xe2\x80\x94and he was in the right of it too. So he talked common-place with\r\nmy mother and Rose, and discussed parish affairs with the vicar,\r\nfarming matters with me, and politics with us both.\r\n\r\nMary Millward was another mute,\xe2\x80\x94not so much tormented with cruel\r\nkindness as Dick Wilson, because she had a certain short, decided way\r\nof answering and refusing, and was supposed to be rather sullen than\r\ndiffident. However that might be, she certainly did not give much\r\npleasure to the company;\xe2\x80\x94nor did she appear to derive much from it.\r\nEliza told me she had only come because her father insisted upon it,\r\nhaving taken it into his head that she devoted herself too exclusively\r\nto her household duties, to the neglect of such relaxations and\r\ninnocent enjoyments as were proper to her age and sex. She seemed to me\r\nto be good-humoured enough on the whole. Once or twice she was provoked\r\nto laughter by the wit or the merriment of some favoured individual\r\namongst us; and then I observed she sought the eye of Richard Wilson,\r\nwho sat over against her. As he studied with her father, she had some\r\nacquaintance with him, in spite of the retiring habits of both, and I\r\nsuppose there was a kind of fellow-feeling established between them.\r\n\r\nMy Eliza was charming beyond description, coquettish without\r\naffectation, and evidently more desirous to engage my attention than\r\nthat of all the room besides. Her delight in having me near her, seated\r\nor standing by her side, whispering in her ear, or pressing her hand in\r\nthe dance, was plainly legible in her glowing face and heaving bosom,\r\nhowever belied by saucy words and gestures. But I had better hold my\r\ntongue: if I boast of these things now, I shall have to blush\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nTo proceed, then, with the various individuals of our party; Rose was\r\nsimple and natural as usual, and full of mirth and vivacity.\r\n\r\nFergus was impertinent and absurd; but his impertinence and folly\r\nserved to make others laugh, if they did not raise himself in their\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\nAnd finally (for I omit myself), Mr. Lawrence was gentlemanly and\r\ninoffensive to all, and polite to the vicar and the ladies, especially\r\nhis hostess and her daughter, and Miss Wilson\xe2\x80\x94misguided man; he had not\r\nthe taste to prefer Eliza Millward. Mr. Lawrence and I were on\r\ntolerably intimate terms. Essentially of reserved habits, and but\r\nseldom quitting the secluded place of his birth, where he had lived in\r\nsolitary state since the death of his father, he had neither the\r\nopportunity nor the inclination for forming many acquaintances; and, of\r\nall he had ever known, I (judging by the results) was the companion\r\nmost agreeable to his taste. I liked the man well enough, but he was\r\ntoo cold, and shy, and self-contained, to obtain my cordial sympathies.\r\nA spirit of candour and frankness, when wholly unaccompanied with\r\ncoarseness, he admired in others, but he could not acquire it himself.\r\nHis excessive reserve upon all his own concerns was, indeed, provoking\r\nand chilly enough; but I forgave it, from a conviction that it\r\noriginated less in pride and want of confidence in his friends, than in\r\na certain morbid feeling of delicacy, and a peculiar diffidence, that\r\nhe was sensible of, but wanted energy to overcome. His heart was like a\r\nsensitive plant, that opens for a moment in the sunshine, but curls up\r\nand shrinks into itself at the slightest touch of the finger, or the\r\nlightest breath of wind. And, upon the whole, our intimacy was rather a\r\nmutual predilection than a deep and solid friendship, such as has since\r\narisen between myself and you, Halford, whom, in spite of your\r\noccasional crustiness, I can liken to nothing so well as an old coat,\r\nunimpeachable in texture, but easy and loose\xe2\x80\x94that has conformed itself\r\nto the shape of the wearer, and which he may use as he pleases, without\r\nbeing bothered with the fear of spoiling it;\xe2\x80\x94whereas Mr. Lawrence was\r\nlike a new garment, all very neat and trim to look at, but so tight in\r\nthe elbows, that you would fear to split the seams by the unrestricted\r\nmotion of your arms, and so smooth and fine in surface that you scruple\r\nto expose it to a single drop of rain.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the guests, my mother mentioned Mrs. Graham,\r\nregretted she was not there to meet them, and explained to the\r\nMillwards and Wilsons the reasons she had given for neglecting to\r\nreturn their calls, hoping they would excuse her, as she was sure she\r\ndid not mean to be uncivil, and would be glad to see them at any\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut she is a very singular lady, Mr. Lawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d added she; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of her\xe2\x80\x94but I daresay you can tell us something\r\nabout her, for she is your tenant, you know,\xe2\x80\x94and she said she knew you\r\na little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned to Mr. Lawrence. I thought he looked unnecessarily\r\nconfused at being so appealed to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, Mrs. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are mistaken\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94I have\r\nseen her, certainly; but I am the last person you should apply to for\r\ninformation respecting Mrs. Graham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then immediately turned to Rose, and asked her to favour the company\r\nwith a song, or a tune on the piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must ask Miss Wilson: she outshines us all in\r\nsinging, and music too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Wilson demurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_She\xe2\x80\x99ll_ sing readily enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fergus, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll undertake to\r\nstand by her, Mr. Lawrence, and turn over the leaves for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be most happy to do so, Miss Wilson; will you allow me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bridled her long neck and smiled, and suffered him to lead her to\r\nthe instrument, where she played and sang, in her very best style, one\r\npiece after another; while he stood patiently by, leaning one hand on\r\nthe back of her chair, and turning over the leaves of her book with the\r\nother. Perhaps he was as much charmed with her performance as she was.\r\nIt was all very fine in its way; but I cannot say that it moved me very\r\ndeeply. There was plenty of skill and execution, but precious little\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nBut we had not done with Mrs. Graham yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take wine, Mrs. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Millward, upon the\r\nintroduction of that beverage; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take a little of your home-brewed\r\nale. I always prefer your home-brewed to anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlattered at this compliment, my mother rang the bell, and a china jug\r\nof our best ale was presently brought and set before the worthy\r\ngentleman who so well knew how to appreciate its excellences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow THIS is the thing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, pouring out a glass of the same in a\r\nlong stream, skilfully directed from the jug to the tumbler, so as to\r\nproduce much foam without spilling a drop; and, having surveyed it for\r\na moment opposite the candle, he took a deep draught, and then smacked\r\nhis lips, drew a long breath, and refilled his glass, my mother looking\r\non with the greatest satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like this, Mrs. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI always maintain\r\nthat there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to compare with your home-brewed ale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you like it, sir. I always look after the brewing\r\nmyself, as well as the cheese and the butter\xe2\x80\x94I like to have things well\r\ndone, while we\xe2\x80\x99re about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quite right_, Mrs. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, Mr. Millward, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it _wrong_ to take a little\r\nwine now and then\xe2\x80\x94or a little spirits either!\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother, as she\r\nhanded a smoking tumbler of gin-and-water to Mrs. Wilson, who affirmed\r\nthat wine sat heavy on her stomach, and whose son Robert was at that\r\nmoment helping himself to a pretty stiff glass of the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the oracle, with a Jove-like nod; \xe2\x80\x9cthese things\r\nare all blessings and mercies, if we only knew how to make use of\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs. Graham doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think so. You shall just hear now what she\r\ntold us the other day\xe2\x80\x94I _told_ her I\xe2\x80\x99d tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd my mother favoured the company with a particular account of that\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken ideas and conduct regarding the matter in hand,\r\nconcluding with, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it is wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrong!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the vicar, with more than common solemnity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccriminal,\r\nI should say\xe2\x80\x94criminal! Not only is it making a fool of the boy, but it\r\nis despising the gifts of Providence, and teaching him to trample them\r\nunder his feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then entered more fully into the question, and explained at large\r\nthe folly and impiety of such a proceeding. My mother heard him with\r\nprofoundest reverence; and even Mrs. Wilson vouchsafed to rest her\r\ntongue for a moment, and listen in silence, while she complacently\r\nsipped her gin-and-water. Mr. Lawrence sat with his elbow on the table,\r\ncarelessly playing with his half-empty wine-glass, and covertly smiling\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, Mr. Millward,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested he, when at length that\r\ngentleman paused in his discourse, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when a child may be naturally\r\nprone to intemperance\xe2\x80\x94by the fault of its parents or ancestors, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94some precautions are advisable?\xe2\x80\x9d (Now it was generally\r\nbelieved that Mr. Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s father had shortened his days by\r\nintemperance.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome precautions, it may be; but temperance, sir, is one thing, and\r\nabstinence another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have heard that, with some persons, temperance\xe2\x80\x94that is,\r\nmoderation\xe2\x80\x94is almost impossible; and if abstinence be an evil (which\r\nsome have doubted), no one will deny that excess is a greater. Some\r\nparents have entirely prohibited their children from tasting\r\nintoxicating liquors; but a parent\xe2\x80\x99s authority cannot last for ever;\r\nchildren are naturally prone to hanker after forbidden things; and a\r\nchild, in such a case, would be likely to have a strong curiosity to\r\ntaste, and try the effect of what has been so lauded and enjoyed by\r\nothers, so strictly forbidden to himself\xe2\x80\x94which curiosity would\r\ngenerally be gratified on the first convenient opportunity; and the\r\nrestraint once broken, serious consequences might ensue. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretend to be a judge of such matters, but it seems to me, that this\r\nplan of Mrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s, as you describe it, Mrs. Markham, extraordinary\r\nas it may be, is not without its advantages; for here you see the child\r\nis delivered at once from temptation; he has no secret curiosity, no\r\nhankering desire; he is as well acquainted with the tempting liquors as\r\nhe ever wishes to be; and is thoroughly disgusted with them, without\r\nhaving suffered from their effects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that right, sir? Have I not proven to you how wrong it is\xe2\x80\x94how\r\ncontrary to Scripture and to reason, to teach a child to look with\r\ncontempt and disgust upon the blessings of Providence, instead of to\r\nuse them aright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may consider laudanum a blessing of Providence, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr.\r\nLawrence, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet, you will allow that most of us had better\r\nabstain from it, even in moderation; but,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not\r\ndesire you to follow out my simile too closely\xe2\x80\x94in witness whereof I\r\nfinish my glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd take another, I hope, Mr. Lawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother, pushing the\r\nbottle towards him.\r\n\r\nHe politely declined, and pushing his chair a little away from the\r\ntable, leant back towards me\xe2\x80\x94I was seated a trifle behind, on the sofa\r\nbeside Eliza Millward\xe2\x80\x94and carelessly asked me if I knew Mrs. Graham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have met her once or twice,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say that I like her much. She is handsome\xe2\x80\x94or rather I should\r\nsay distinguished and interesting\xe2\x80\x94in her appearance, but by no means\r\namiable\xe2\x80\x94a woman liable to take strong prejudices, I should fancy, and\r\nstick to them through thick and thin, twisting everything into\r\nconformity with her own preconceived opinions\xe2\x80\x94too hard, too sharp, too\r\nbitter for my taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, but looked down and bit his lip, and shortly after\r\nrose and sauntered up to Miss Wilson, as much repelled by me, I fancy,\r\nas attracted by her. I scarcely noticed it at the time, but afterwards\r\nI was led to recall this and other trifling facts, of a similar nature,\r\nto my remembrance, when\xe2\x80\x94but I must not anticipate.\r\n\r\nWe wound up the evening with dancing\xe2\x80\x94our worthy pastor thinking it no\r\nscandal to be present on the occasion, though one of the village\r\nmusicians was engaged to direct our evolutions with his violin. But\r\nMary Millward obstinately refused to join us; and so did Richard\r\nWilson, though my mother earnestly entreated him to do so, and even\r\noffered to be his partner.\r\n\r\nWe managed very well without them, however. With a single set of\r\nquadrilles, and several country dances, we carried it on to a pretty\r\nlate hour; and at length, having called upon our musician to strike up\r\na waltz, I was just about to whirl Eliza round in that delightful\r\ndance, accompanied by Lawrence and Jane Wilson, and Fergus and Rose,\r\nwhen Mr. Millward interposed with:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I don\xe2\x80\x99t allow that! Come,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s time to be going now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, papa!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Eliza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh time, my girl\xe2\x80\x94high time! Moderation in all things, remember!\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the plan\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Let your moderation be known unto all men!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut in revenge I followed Eliza into the dimly-lighted passage, where,\r\nunder pretence of helping her on with her shawl, I fear I must plead\r\nguilty to snatching a kiss behind her father\xe2\x80\x99s back, while he was\r\nenveloping his throat and chin in the folds of a mighty comforter. But\r\nalas! in turning round, there was my mother close beside me. The\r\nconsequence was, that no sooner were the guests departed, than I was\r\ndoomed to a very serious remonstrance, which unpleasantly checked the\r\ngalloping course of my spirits, and made a disagreeable close to the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Gilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do so! You know how\r\ndeeply I have your advantage at heart, how I love you and prize you\r\nabove everything else in the world, and how much I long to see you well\r\nsettled in life\xe2\x80\x94and how bitterly it would grieve me to see you married\r\nto that girl\xe2\x80\x94or any other in the neighbourhood. What you _see_ in her I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t only the want of money that I think about\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nof the kind\xe2\x80\x94but there\xe2\x80\x99s neither beauty, nor cleverness, nor goodness,\r\nnor anything else that\xe2\x80\x99s desirable. If you knew your own value, as I\r\ndo, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of it. Do wait awhile and see! If you bind\r\nyourself to her, you\xe2\x80\x99ll repent it all your lifetime when you look round\r\nand see how many better there are. Take my word for it, you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mother, do be quiet!\xe2\x80\x94I hate to be lectured!\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to\r\nmarry yet, I tell you; but\xe2\x80\x94dear me! mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I enjoy myself at _all?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear boy, but not in that way. Indeed, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do such\r\nthings. You would be wronging the girl, if she were what she ought to\r\nbe; but I assure you she is as artful a little hussy as anybody need\r\nwish to see; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get entangled in her snares before you know\r\nwhere you are. And if you _do_ marry her, Gilbert, you\xe2\x80\x99ll break my\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94so there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry about it, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, for the tears were gushing\r\nfrom her eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cthere, let that kiss efface the one I gave Eliza; don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nabuse her any more, and set your mind at rest; for I\xe2\x80\x99ll promise\r\nnever\xe2\x80\x94that is, I\xe2\x80\x99ll promise to think twice before I take any important\r\nstep you seriously disapprove of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, I lighted my candle, and went to bed, considerably quenched\r\nin spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about the close of the month, that, yielding at length to the\r\nurgent importunities of Rose, I accompanied her in a visit to Wildfell\r\nHall. To our surprise, we were ushered into a room where the first\r\nobject that met the eye was a painter\xe2\x80\x99s easel, with a table beside it\r\ncovered with rolls of canvas, bottles of oil and varnish, palette,\r\nbrushes, paints, &c. Leaning against the wall were several sketches in\r\nvarious stages of progression, and a few finished paintings\xe2\x80\x94mostly of\r\nlandscapes and figures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must make you welcome to my studio,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Graham; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no\r\nfire in the sitting-room to-day, and it is rather too cold to show you\r\ninto a place with an empty grate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd disengaging a couple of chairs from the artistical lumber that\r\nusurped them, she bid us be seated, and resumed her place beside the\r\neasel\xe2\x80\x94not facing it exactly, but now and then glancing at the picture\r\nupon it while she conversed, and giving it an occasional touch with her\r\nbrush, as if she found it impossible to wean her attention entirely\r\nfrom her occupation to fix it upon her guests. It was a view of\r\nWildfell Hall, as seen at early morning from the field below, rising in\r\ndark relief against a sky of clear silvery blue, with a few red streaks\r\non the horizon, faithfully drawn and coloured, and very elegantly and\r\nartistically handled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see your heart is in your work, Mrs. Graham,\xe2\x80\x9d observed I: \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\nbeg you to go on with it; for if you suffer our presence to interrupt\r\nyou, we shall be constrained to regard ourselves as unwelcome\r\nintruders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, throwing her brush on to the table, as if\r\nstartled into politeness. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not so beset with visitors but that I\r\ncan readily spare a few minutes to the few that do favour me with their\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have almost completed your painting,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, approaching to\r\nobserve it more closely, and surveying it with a greater degree of\r\nadmiration and delight than I cared to express. \xe2\x80\x9cA few more touches in\r\nthe foreground will finish it, I should think. But why have you called\r\nit Fernley Manor, Cumberland, instead of Wildfell Hall, \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94shire?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked, alluding to the name she had traced in small characters at the\r\nbottom of the canvas.\r\n\r\nBut immediately I was sensible of having committed an act of\r\nimpertinence in so doing; for she coloured and hesitated; but after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, with a kind of desperate frankness, she replied:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have friends\xe2\x80\x94acquaintances at least\xe2\x80\x94in the world, from whom\r\nI desire my present abode to be concealed; and as they might see the\r\npicture, and might possibly recognise the style in spite of the false\r\ninitials I have put in the corner, I take the precaution to give a\r\nfalse name to the place also, in order to put them on a wrong scent, if\r\nthey should attempt to trace me out by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to keep the picture?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, anxious to say\r\nanything to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I cannot afford to paint for my own amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma sends all her pictures to London,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur; \xe2\x80\x9cand somebody\r\nsells them for her there, and sends us the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn looking round upon the other pieces, I remarked a pretty sketch of\r\nLindenhope from the top of the hill; another view of the old hall\r\nbasking in the sunny haze of a quiet summer afternoon; and a simple but\r\nstriking little picture of a child brooding, with looks of silent but\r\ndeep and sorrowful regret, over a handful of withered flowers, with\r\nglimpses of dark low hills and autumnal fields behind it, and a dull\r\nbeclouded sky above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see there is a sad dearth of subjects,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the fair artist.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the old hall once on a moonlight night, and I suppose I must\r\ntake it again on a snowy winter\xe2\x80\x99s day, and then again on a dark cloudy\r\nevening; for I really have nothing else to paint. I have been told that\r\nyou have a fine view of the sea somewhere in the neighbourhood. Is it\r\ntrue?\xe2\x80\x94and is it within walking distance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t object to walking four miles\xe2\x80\x94or nearly so\xe2\x80\x94little\r\nshort of eight miles, there and back\xe2\x80\x94and over a somewhat rough,\r\nfatiguing road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what direction does it lie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI described the situation as well as I could, and was entering upon an\r\nexplanation of the various roads, lanes, and fields to be traversed in\r\norder to reach it, the goings straight on, and turnings to the right\r\nand the left, when she checked me with,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop! don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me now: I shall forget every word of your\r\ndirections before I require them. I shall not think about going till\r\nnext spring; and then, perhaps, I may trouble you. At present we have\r\nthe winter before us, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe suddenly paused, with a suppressed exclamation, started up from her\r\nseat, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me one moment,\xe2\x80\x9d hurried from the room, and\r\nshut the door behind her.\r\n\r\nCurious to see what had startled her so, I looked towards the\r\nwindow\xe2\x80\x94for her eyes had been carelessly fixed upon it the moment\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94and just beheld the skirts of a man\xe2\x80\x99s coat vanishing behind a\r\nlarge holly-bush that stood between the window and the porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s mamma\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur.\r\n\r\nRose and I looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of her at all,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Rose.\r\n\r\nThe child looked at her in grave surprise. She straightway began to\r\ntalk to him on indifferent matters, while I amused myself with looking\r\nat the pictures. There was one in an obscure corner that I had not\r\nbefore observed. It was a little child, seated on the grass with its\r\nlap full of flowers. The tiny features and large blue eyes, smiling\r\nthrough a shock of light brown curls, shaken over the forehead as it\r\nbent above its treasure, bore sufficient resemblance to those of the\r\nyoung gentleman before me to proclaim it a portrait of Arthur Graham in\r\nhis early infancy.\r\n\r\nIn taking this up to bring it to the light, I discovered another behind\r\nit, with its face to the wall. I ventured to take that up too. It was\r\nthe portrait of a gentleman in the full prime of youthful\r\nmanhood\xe2\x80\x94handsome enough, and not badly executed; but if done by the\r\nsame hand as the others, it was evidently some years before; for there\r\nwas far more careful minuteness of detail, and less of that freshness\r\nof colouring and freedom of handling that delighted and surprised me in\r\nthem. Nevertheless, I surveyed it with considerable interest. There was\r\na certain individuality in the features and expression that stamped it,\r\nat once, a successful likeness. The bright blue eyes regarded the\r\nspectator with a kind of lurking drollery\xe2\x80\x94you almost expected to see\r\nthem wink; the lips\xe2\x80\x94a little too voluptuously full\xe2\x80\x94seemed ready to\r\nbreak into a smile; the warmly-tinted cheeks were embellished with a\r\nluxuriant growth of reddish whiskers; while the bright chestnut hair,\r\nclustering in abundant, wavy curls, trespassed too much upon the\r\nforehead, and seemed to intimate that the owner thereof was prouder of\r\nhis beauty than his intellect\xe2\x80\x94as, perhaps, he had reason to be; and yet\r\nhe looked no fool.\r\n\r\nI had not had the portrait in my hands two minutes before the fair\r\nartist returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly some one come about the pictures,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in apology for her\r\nabrupt departure: \xe2\x80\x9cI told him to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear it will be considered an act of impertinence,\xe2\x80\x9d I said \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\npresume to look at a picture that the artist has turned to the wall;\r\nbut may I ask\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ an act of very great impertinence, sir; and therefore I beg\r\nyou will ask nothing about it, for your curiosity will not be\r\ngratified,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, attempting to cover the tartness of her rebuke\r\nwith a smile; but I could see, by her flushed cheek and kindling eye,\r\nthat she was seriously annoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only going to ask if you had painted it yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said I,\r\nsulkily resigning the picture into her hands; for without a grain of\r\nceremony she took it from me; and quickly restoring it to the dark\r\ncorner, with its face to the wall, placed the other against it as\r\nbefore, and then turned to me and laughed.\r\n\r\nBut I was in no humour for jesting. I carelessly turned to the window,\r\nand stood looking out upon the desolate garden, leaving her to talk to\r\nRose for a minute or two; and then, telling my sister it was time to\r\ngo, shook hands with the little gentleman, coolly bowed to the lady,\r\nand moved towards the door. But, having bid adieu to Rose, Mrs. Graham\r\npresented her hand to me, saying, with a soft voice, and by no means a\r\ndisagreeable smile,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLet not the sun go down upon your wrath, Mr.\r\nMarkham. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I offended you by my abruptness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen a lady condescends to apologise, there is no keeping one\xe2\x80\x99s anger,\r\nof course; so we parted good friends for once; and _this_ time I\r\nsqueezed her hand with a cordial, not a spiteful pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next four months I did not enter Mrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s house, nor\r\nshe mine; but still the ladies continued to talk about her, and still\r\nour acquaintance continued, though slowly, to advance. As for their\r\ntalk, I paid but little attention to that (when it related to the fair\r\nhermit, I mean), and the only information I derived from it was, that\r\none fine frosty day she had ventured to take her little boy as far as\r\nthe vicarage, and that, unfortunately, nobody was at home but Miss\r\nMillward; nevertheless, she had sat a long time, and, by all accounts,\r\nthey had found a good deal to say to each other, and parted with a\r\nmutual desire to meet again. But Mary liked children, and fond mammas\r\nlike those who can duly appreciate their treasures.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes I saw her myself, not only when she came to church, but\r\nwhen she was out on the hills with her son, whether taking a long,\r\npurpose-like walk, or\xe2\x80\x94on special fine days\xe2\x80\x94leisurely rambling over the\r\nmoor or the bleak pasture-lands, surrounding the old hall, herself with\r\na book in her hand, her son gambolling about her; and, on any of these\r\noccasions, when I caught sight of her in my solitary walks or rides, or\r\nwhile following my agricultural pursuits, I generally contrived to meet\r\nor overtake her, for I rather liked to see Mrs. Graham, and to talk to\r\nher, and I decidedly liked to talk to her little companion, whom, when\r\nonce the ice of his shyness was fairly broken, I found to be a very\r\namiable, intelligent, and entertaining little fellow; and we soon\r\nbecame excellent friends\xe2\x80\x94how much to the gratification of his mamma I\r\ncannot undertake to say. I suspected at first that she was desirous of\r\nthrowing cold water on this growing intimacy\xe2\x80\x94to quench, as it were, the\r\nkindling flame of our friendship\xe2\x80\x94but discovering, at length, in spite\r\nof her prejudice against me, that I was perfectly harmless, and even\r\nwell-intentioned, and that, between myself and my dog, her son derived\r\na great deal of pleasure from the acquaintance that he would not\r\notherwise have known, she ceased to object, and even welcomed my coming\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nAs for Arthur, he would shout his welcome from afar, and run to meet me\r\nfifty yards from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side. If I happened to be on horseback he\r\nwas sure to get a canter or a gallop; or, if there was one of the\r\ndraught horses within an available distance, he was treated to a steady\r\nride upon that, which served his turn almost as well; but his mother\r\nwould always follow and trudge beside him\xe2\x80\x94not so much, I believe, to\r\nensure his safe conduct, as to see that I instilled no objectionable\r\nnotions into his infant mind, for she was ever on the watch, and never\r\nwould allow him to be taken out of her sight. What pleased her best of\r\nall was to see him romping and racing with Sancho, while I walked by\r\nher side\xe2\x80\x94not, I fear, for love of my company (though I sometimes\r\ndeluded myself with that idea), so much as for the delight she took in\r\nseeing her son thus happily engaged in the enjoyment of those active\r\nsports so invigorating to his tender frame, yet so seldom exercised for\r\nwant of playmates suited to his years: and, perhaps, her pleasure was\r\nsweetened not a little by the fact of my being with _her_ instead of\r\nwith _him_, and therefore incapable of doing him any injury directly or\r\nindirectly, designedly or otherwise, small thanks to her for that same.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, I believe, she really had some little gratification in\r\nconversing with me; and one bright February morning, during twenty\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 stroll along the moor, she laid aside her usual asperity and\r\nreserve, and fairly entered into conversation with me, discoursing with\r\nso much eloquence and depth of thought and feeling on a subject happily\r\ncoinciding with my own ideas, and looking so beautiful withal, that I\r\nwent home enchanted; and on the way (morally) started to find myself\r\nthinking that, after all, it would, perhaps, be better to spend one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndays with such a woman than with Eliza Millward; and then I\r\n(figuratively) blushed for my inconstancy.\r\n\r\nOn entering the parlour I found Eliza there with Rose, and no one else.\r\nThe surprise was not altogether so agreeable as it ought to have been.\r\nWe chatted together a long time, but I found her rather frivolous, and\r\neven a little insipid, compared with the more mature and earnest Mrs.\r\nGraham. Alas, for human constancy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought not to marry Eliza, since my mother so\r\nstrongly objects to it, and I ought not to delude the girl with the\r\nidea that I intended to do so. Now, if this mood continue, I shall have\r\nless difficulty in emancipating my affections from her soft yet\r\nunrelenting sway; and, though Mrs. Graham might be equally\r\nobjectionable, I may be permitted, like the doctors, to cure a greater\r\nevil by a less, for I shall not fall seriously in love with the young\r\nwidow, I think, nor she with me\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s certain\xe2\x80\x94but if I find a little\r\npleasure in her society I may surely be allowed to seek it; and if the\r\nstar of her divinity be bright enough to dim the lustre of Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s, so\r\nmuch the better, but I scarcely can think it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thereafter I seldom suffered a fine day to pass without paying a\r\nvisit to Wildfell about the time my new acquaintance usually left her\r\nhermitage; but so frequently was I baulked in my expectations of\r\nanother interview, so changeable was she in her times of coming forth\r\nand in her places of resort, so transient were the occasional glimpses\r\nI was able to obtain, that I felt half inclined to think she took as\r\nmuch pains to avoid my company as I to seek hers; but this was too\r\ndisagreeable a supposition to be entertained a moment after it could\r\nconveniently be dismissed.\r\n\r\nOne calm, clear afternoon, however, in March, as I was superintending\r\nthe rolling of the meadow-land, and the repairing of a hedge in the\r\nvalley, I saw Mrs. Graham down by the brook, with a sketch-book in her\r\nhand, absorbed in the exercise of her favourite art, while Arthur was\r\nputting on the time with constructing dams and breakwaters in the\r\nshallow, stony stream. I was rather in want of amusement, and so rare\r\nan opportunity was not to be neglected; so, leaving both meadow and\r\nhedge, I quickly repaired to the spot, but not before Sancho, who,\r\nimmediately upon perceiving his young friend, scoured at full gallop\r\nthe intervening space, and pounced upon him with an impetuous mirth\r\nthat precipitated the child almost into the middle of the beck; but,\r\nhappily, the stones preserved him from any serious wetting, while their\r\nsmoothness prevented his being too much hurt to laugh at the untoward\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Graham was studying the distinctive characters of the different\r\nvarieties of trees in their winter nakedness, and copying, with a\r\nspirited, though delicate touch, their various ramifications. She did\r\nnot talk much, but I stood and watched the progress of her pencil: it\r\nwas a pleasure to behold it so dexterously guided by those fair and\r\ngraceful fingers. But ere long their dexterity became impaired, they\r\nbegan to hesitate, to tremble slightly, and make false strokes, and\r\nthen suddenly came to a pause, while their owner laughingly raised her\r\nface to mine, and told me that her sketch did not profit by my\r\nsuperintendence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Arthur till you\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have a ride, Mr. Markham, if mamma will let me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s a horse in that field,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, pointing to where\r\nthe strong black mare was pulling the roller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Arthur; it\xe2\x80\x99s too far,\xe2\x80\x9d objected his mother.\r\n\r\nBut I promised to bring him safe back after a turn or two up and down\r\nthe meadow; and when she looked at his eager face she smiled and let\r\nhim go. It was the first time she had even allowed me to take him so\r\nmuch as half a field\xe2\x80\x99s length from her side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEnthroned upon his monstrous steed, and solemnly proceeding up and down\r\nthe wide, steep field, he looked the very incarnation of quiet, gleeful\r\nsatisfaction and delight. The rolling, however, was soon completed; but\r\nwhen I dismounted the gallant horseman, and restored him to his mother,\r\nshe seemed rather displeased at my keeping him so long. She had shut up\r\nher sketch-book, and been, probably, for some minutes impatiently\r\nwaiting his return.\r\n\r\nIt was now high time to go home, she said, and would have bid me\r\ngood-evening, but I was not going to leave her yet: I accompanied her\r\nhalf-way up the hill. She became more sociable, and I was beginning to\r\nbe very happy; but, on coming within sight of the grim old hall, she\r\nstood still, and turned towards me while she spoke, as if expecting I\r\nshould go no further, that the conversation would end here, and I\r\nshould now take leave and depart\xe2\x80\x94as, indeed, it was time to do, for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe clear, cold eve\xe2\x80\x9d was fast \xe2\x80\x9cdeclining,\xe2\x80\x9d the sun had set, and the\r\ngibbous moon was visibly brightening in the pale grey sky; but a\r\nfeeling almost of compassion riveted me to the spot. It seemed hard to\r\nleave her to such a lonely, comfortless home. I looked up at it. Silent\r\nand grim it frowned before us. A faint, red light was gleaming from the\r\nlower windows of one wing, but all the other windows were in darkness,\r\nand many exhibited their black, cavernous gulfs, entirely destitute of\r\nglazing or framework.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not find it a desolate place to live in?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after a\r\nmoment of silent contemplation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she. \xe2\x80\x9cOn winter evenings, when Arthur is in\r\nbed, and I am sitting there alone, hearing the bleak wind moaning round\r\nme and howling through the ruinous old chambers, no books or\r\noccupations can repress the dismal thoughts and apprehensions that come\r\ncrowding in\xe2\x80\x94but it is folly to give way to such weakness, I know. If\r\nRachel is satisfied with such a life, why should not I?\xe2\x80\x94Indeed, I\r\ncannot be too thankful for such an asylum, while it is left me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe closing sentence was uttered in an under-tone, as if spoken rather\r\nto herself than to me. She then bid me good-evening and withdrew.\r\n\r\nI had not proceeded many steps on my way homewards when I perceived Mr.\r\nLawrence, on his pretty grey pony, coming up the rugged lane that\r\ncrossed over the hill-top. I went a little out of my way to speak to\r\nhim; for we had not met for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that Mrs. Graham you were speaking to just now?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after\r\nthe first few words of greeting had passed between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! I thought so.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked contemplatively at his horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane,\r\nas if he had some serious cause of dissatisfaction with it, or\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I thought you disliked her,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nquietly added, curling his classic lip with a slightly sarcastic smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I did; mayn\xe2\x80\x99t a man change his mind on further acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he, nicely reducing an entanglement in the\r\npony\xe2\x80\x99s redundant hoary mane. Then suddenly turning to me, and fixing\r\nhis shy, hazel eyes upon me with a steady penetrating gaze, he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you _have_ changed your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I have exactly. No; I think I hold the same opinion\r\nrespecting her as before\xe2\x80\x94but slightly ameliorated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked round for something else to talk about; and glancing up\r\nat the moon, made some remark upon the beauty of the evening, which I\r\ndid not answer, as being irrelevant to the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, calmly looking him in the face, \xe2\x80\x9care you in love\r\nwith Mrs. Graham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of his being deeply offended at this, as I more than half\r\nexpected he would, the first start of surprise, at the audacious\r\nquestion, was followed by a tittering laugh, as if he was highly amused\r\nat the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ in love with her!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you dream of such a\r\nthing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the interest you take in the progress of my acquaintance with the\r\nlady, and the changes of my opinion concerning her, I thought you might\r\nbe jealous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cJealous! no. But I thought you were going to marry\r\nEliza Millward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought wrong, then; I am not going to marry either one or the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94that I know of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I think you\xe2\x80\x99d better let them alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to marry Jane Wilson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe coloured, and played with the mane again, but answered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you had better let her alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t let me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he might have said; but he only looked silly\r\nand said nothing for the space of half a minute, and then made another\r\nattempt to turn the conversation; and this time I let it pass; for he\r\nhad borne enough: another word on the subject would have been like the\r\nlast atom that breaks the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\nI was too late for tea; but my mother had kindly kept the teapot and\r\nmuffin warm upon the hobs, and, though she scolded me a little, readily\r\nadmitted my excuses; and when I complained of the flavour of the\r\noverdrawn tea, she poured the remainder into the slop-basin, and bade\r\nRose put some fresh into the pot, and reboil the kettle, which offices\r\nwere performed with great commotion, and certain remarkable comments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x94if it had been me now, I should have had no tea at all\xe2\x80\x94if it had\r\nbeen Fergus, even, he would have to put up with such as there was, and\r\nbeen told to be thankful, for it was far too good for him; but _you_\xe2\x80\x94we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do too much for you. It\xe2\x80\x99s always so\xe2\x80\x94if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything\r\nparticularly nice at table, mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from\r\nit, and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t attend to that, she whispers, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t eat so much of\r\nthat, Rose; Gilbert will like it for his supper.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ nothing at all.\r\nIn the parlour, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Come, Rose, put away your things, and let\xe2\x80\x99s have\r\nthe room nice and tidy against they come in; and keep up a good fire;\r\nGilbert likes a cheerful fire.\xe2\x80\x99 In the kitchen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Make that pie a large\r\none, Rose; I daresay the boys\xe2\x80\x99ll be hungry; and don\xe2\x80\x99t put so much\r\npepper in, they\xe2\x80\x99ll not like it, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94or, \xe2\x80\x98Rose, don\xe2\x80\x99t put so many\r\nspices in the pudding, Gilbert likes it plain,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94or, \xe2\x80\x98Mind you put\r\nplenty of currants in the cake, Fergus liked plenty.\xe2\x80\x99 If I say, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nMamma, _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m told I ought not to think of myself. \xe2\x80\x98You know,\r\nRose, in all household matters, we have only two things to consider,\r\nfirst, what\xe2\x80\x99s proper to be done; and, secondly, what\xe2\x80\x99s most agreeable\r\nto the gentlemen of the house\xe2\x80\x94anything will do for the ladies.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd very good doctrine too,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother. \xe2\x80\x9cGilbert thinks so, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery convenient doctrine, for us, at all events,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you\r\nwould really study my pleasure, mother, you must consider your own\r\ncomfort and convenience a little more than you do\xe2\x80\x94as for Rose, I have\r\nno doubt she\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of herself; and whenever she does make a\r\nsacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness, she\xe2\x80\x99ll take good\r\ncare to let me know the extent of it. But for _you_, I might sink into\r\nthe grossest condition of self-indulgence and carelessness about the\r\nwants of others, from the mere habit of being constantly cared for\r\nmyself, and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied,\r\nwhile left in total ignorance of what is done for me,\xe2\x80\x94if Rose did not\r\nenlighten me now and then; and I should receive all your kindness as a\r\nmatter of course, and never know how much I owe you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! and you never _will_ know, Gilbert, till you\xe2\x80\x99re married. Then,\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some trifling, self-conceited girl like Eliza Millward,\r\ncareless of everything but her own immediate pleasure and advantage, or\r\nsome misguided, obstinate woman, like Mrs. Graham, ignorant of her\r\nprincipal duties, and clever only in what concerns her least to\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94then you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will do me good, mother; I was not sent into the world merely to\r\nexercise the good capacities and good feelings of others\xe2\x80\x94was I?\xe2\x80\x94but to\r\nexert my own towards them; and when I marry, I shall expect to find\r\nmore pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable, than in being\r\nmade so by her: I would rather give than receive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense, my dear. It\xe2\x80\x99s mere boy\xe2\x80\x99s talk that! You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsoon tire of petting and humouring your wife, be she ever so charming,\r\nand _then_ comes the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we must bear one another\xe2\x80\x99s burdens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must fall each into your proper place. You\xe2\x80\x99ll do your\r\nbusiness, and she, if she\xe2\x80\x99s worthy of you, will do hers; but it\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nbusiness to please yourself, and hers to please you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure your\r\npoor, dear father was as good a husband as ever lived, and after the\r\nfirst six months or so were over, I should as soon have expected him to\r\nfly, as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me. He always said I\r\nwas a good wife, and did my duty; and he always did his\xe2\x80\x94bless him!\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas steady and punctual, seldom found fault without a reason, always\r\ndid justice to my good dinners, and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by\r\ndelay\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s as much as any woman can expect of any man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIs it so, Halford? Is that the extent of _your_ domestic virtues; and\r\ndoes your happy wife exact no more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nNot many days after this, on a mild sunny morning\xe2\x80\x94rather soft under\r\nfoot; for the last fall of snow was only just wasted away, leaving yet\r\na thin ridge, here and there, lingering on the fresh green grass\r\nbeneath the hedges; but beside them already, the young primroses were\r\npeeping from among their moist, dark foliage, and the lark above was\r\nsinging of summer, and hope, and love, and every heavenly thing\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\nout on the hill-side, enjoying these delights, and looking after the\r\nwell-being of my young lambs and their mothers, when, on glancing round\r\nme, I beheld three persons ascending from the vale below. They were\r\nEliza Millward, Fergus, and Rose; so I crossed the field to meet them;\r\nand, being told they were going to Wildfell Hall, I declared myself\r\nwilling to go with them, and offering my arm to Eliza, who readily\r\naccepted it in lieu of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s, told the latter he might go back,\r\nfor I would accompany the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg _your_ pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the ladies that are\r\naccompanying me, not I them. You had all had a peep at this wonderful\r\nstranger but me, and I could endure my wretched ignorance no\r\nlonger\xe2\x80\x94come what would, I must be satisfied; so I begged Rose to go\r\nwith me to the Hall, and introduce me to her at once. She swore she\r\nwould not, unless Miss Eliza would go too; so I ran to the vicarage and\r\nfetched her; and we\xe2\x80\x99ve come hooked all the way, as fond as a pair of\r\nlovers\xe2\x80\x94and now you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken her from me; and you want to deprive me of\r\nmy walk and my visit besides. Go back to your fields and your cattle,\r\nyou lubberly fellow; you\xe2\x80\x99re not fit to associate with ladies and\r\ngentlemen like us, that have nothing to do but to run snooking about to\r\nour neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 houses, peeping into their private corners, and\r\nscenting out their secrets, and picking holes in their coats, when we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t find them ready made to our hands\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand such\r\nrefined sources of enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you both go?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Eliza, disregarding the latter half of\r\nthe speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, both, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rose; \xe2\x80\x9cthe more the merrier\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nwe shall want all the cheerfulness we can carry with us to that great,\r\ndark, gloomy room, with its narrow latticed windows, and its dismal old\r\nfurniture\xe2\x80\x94unless she shows us into her studio again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we went all in a body; and the meagre old maid-servant, that opened\r\nthe door, ushered us into an apartment such as Rose had described to me\r\nas the scene of her first introduction to Mrs. Graham, a tolerably\r\nspacious and lofty room, but obscurely lighted by the old-fashioned\r\nwindows, the ceiling, panels, and chimney-piece of grim black oak\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlatter elaborately but not very tastefully carved,\xe2\x80\x94with tables and\r\nchairs to match, an old bookcase on one side of the fire-place, stocked\r\nwith a motley assemblage of books, and an elderly cabinet piano on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe lady was seated in a stiff, high-backed arm-chair, with a small\r\nround table, containing a desk and a work-basket on one side of her,\r\nand her little boy on the other, who stood leaning his elbow on her\r\nknee, and reading to her, with wonderful fluency, from a small volume\r\nthat lay in her lap; while she rested her hand on his shoulder, and\r\nabstractedly played with the long, wavy curls that fell on his ivory\r\nneck. They struck me as forming a pleasing contrast to all the\r\nsurrounding objects; but of course their position was immediately\r\nchanged on our entrance. I could only observe the picture during the\r\nfew brief seconds that Rachel held the door for our admittance.\r\n\r\nI do not think Mrs. Graham was particularly delighted to see us: there\r\nwas something indescribably chilly in her quiet, calm civility; but I\r\ndid not talk much to her. Seating myself near the window, a little back\r\nfrom the circle, I called Arthur to me, and he and I and Sancho amused\r\nourselves very pleasantly together, while the two young ladies baited\r\nhis mother with small talk, and Fergus sat opposite with his legs\r\ncrossed and his hands in his breeches-pockets, leaning back in his\r\nchair, and staring now up at the ceiling, now straight forward at his\r\nhostess (in a manner that made me strongly inclined to kick him out of\r\nthe room), now whistling sotto voce to himself a snatch of a favourite\r\nair, now interrupting the conversation, or filling up a pause (as the\r\ncase might be) with some most impertinent question or remark. At one\r\ntime it was,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt, amazes me, Mrs. Graham, how you could choose such a\r\ndilapidated, rickety old place as this to live in. If you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafford to occupy the whole house, and have it mended up, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou take a neat little cottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I was too proud, Mr. Fergus,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I\r\ntook a particular fancy for this romantic, old-fashioned place\xe2\x80\x94but,\r\nindeed, it has many advantages over a cottage\xe2\x80\x94in the first place, you\r\nsee, the rooms are larger and more airy; in the second place, the\r\nunoccupied apartments, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t pay for, may serve as\r\nlumber-rooms, if I have anything to put in them; and they are very\r\nuseful for my little boy to run about in on rainy days when he can\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nout; and then there is the garden for him to play in, and for me to\r\nwork in. You see I have effected some little improvement already,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued she, turning to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a bed of young\r\nvegetables in that corner, and here are some snowdrops and primroses\r\nalready in bloom\xe2\x80\x94and there, too, is a yellow crocus just opening in the\r\nsunshine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then how can you bear such a situation\xe2\x80\x94your nearest neighbours two\r\nmiles distant, and nobody looking in or passing by? Rose would go stark\r\nmad in such a place. She can\xe2\x80\x99t put on life unless she sees half a dozen\r\nfresh gowns and bonnets a day\xe2\x80\x94not to speak of the faces within; but you\r\nmight sit watching at these windows all day long, and never see so much\r\nas an old woman carrying her eggs to market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure the loneliness of the place was not one of its chief\r\nrecommendations. I take no pleasure in watching people pass the\r\nwindows; and I like to be quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! as good as to say you wish we would all of us mind our own\r\nbusiness, and let you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I dislike an extensive acquaintance; but if I have a few friends,\r\nof course I am glad to see them occasionally. No one can be happy in\r\neternal solitude. Therefore, Mr. Fergus, if you choose to enter my\r\nhouse as a friend, I will make you welcome; if not, I must confess, I\r\nwould rather you kept away.\xe2\x80\x9d She then turned and addressed some\r\nobservation to Rose or Eliza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Mrs. Graham,\xe2\x80\x9d said he again, five minutes after, \xe2\x80\x9cwe were\r\ndisputing, as we came along, a question that you can readily decide for\r\nus, as it mainly regarded yourself\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, we often hold\r\ndiscussions about you; for some of us have nothing better to do than to\r\ntalk about our neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 concerns, and we, the indigenous plants of\r\nthe soil, have known each other so long, and talked each other over so\r\noften, that we are quite sick of that game; so that a stranger coming\r\namongst us makes an invaluable addition to our exhausted sources of\r\namusement. Well, the question, or questions, you are requested to\r\nsolve\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, Fergus!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rose, in a fever of apprehension and\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, I tell you. The questions you are requested to solve are\r\nthese:\xe2\x80\x94First, concerning your birth, extraction, and previous\r\nresidence. Some will have it that you are a foreigner, and some an\r\nEnglishwoman; some a native of the north country, and some of the\r\nsouth; some say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Fergus, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m an Englishwoman\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nwhy any one should doubt it\xe2\x80\x94and I was born in the country, neither in\r\nthe extreme north nor south of our happy isle; and in the country I\r\nhave chiefly passed my life, and now I hope you are satisfied; for I am\r\nnot disposed to answer any more questions at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not one more!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed she, and, instantly quitting her seat, she\r\nsought refuge at the window by which I was seated, and, in very\r\ndesperation, to escape my brother\xe2\x80\x99s persecutions, endeavoured to draw\r\nme into conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, her rapid utterance and heightened colour too\r\nplainly evincing her disquietude, \xe2\x80\x9chave you forgotten the fine sea-view\r\nwe were speaking of some time ago? I think I must trouble you, now, to\r\ntell me the nearest way to it; for if this beautiful weather continue,\r\nI shall, perhaps, be able to walk there, and take my sketch; I have\r\nexhausted every other subject for painting; and I long to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to comply with her request, but Rose would not suffer me to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell her, Gilbert!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she; \xe2\x80\x9cshe shall go with us. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Bay you are thinking about, I suppose, Mrs. Graham? It is a very\r\nlong walk, too far for you, and out of the question for Arthur. But we\r\nwere thinking about making a picnic to see it some fine day; and, if\r\nyou will wait till the settled fine weather comes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we shall\r\nall be delighted to have you amongst us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Graham looked dismayed, and attempted to make excuses, but\r\nRose, either compassionating her lonely life, or anxious to cultivate\r\nher acquaintance, was determined to have her; and every objection was\r\noverruled. She was told it would only be a small party, and all\r\nfriends, and that the best view of all was from \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Cliffs, full five\r\nmiles distant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a nice walk for the gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rose; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the ladies\r\nwill drive and walk by turns; for we shall have our pony-carriage,\r\nwhich will be plenty large enough to contain little Arthur and three\r\nladies, together with your sketching apparatus, and our provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the proposal was finally acceded to; and, after some further\r\ndiscussion respecting the time and manner of the projected excursion,\r\nwe rose, and took our leave.\r\n\r\nBut this was only March: a cold, wet April, and two weeks of May passed\r\nover before we could venture forth on our expedition with the\r\nreasonable hope of obtaining that pleasure we sought in pleasant\r\nprospects, cheerful society, fresh air, good cheer and exercise,\r\nwithout the alloy of bad roads, cold winds, or threatening clouds.\r\nThen, on a glorious morning, we gathered our forces and set forth. The\r\ncompany consisted of Mrs. and Master Graham, Mary and Eliza Millward,\r\nJane and Richard Wilson, and Rose, Fergus, and Gilbert Markham.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence had been invited to join us, but, for some reason best\r\nknown to himself, had refused to give us his company. I had solicited\r\nthe favour myself. When I did so, he hesitated, and asked who were\r\ngoing. Upon my naming Miss Wilson among the rest, he seemed half\r\ninclined to go, but when I mentioned Mrs. Graham, thinking it might be\r\na further inducement, it appeared to have a contrary effect, and he\r\ndeclined it altogether, and, to confess the truth, the decision was not\r\ndispleasing to me, though I could scarcely tell you why.\r\n\r\nIt was about midday when we reached the place of our destination. Mrs.\r\nGraham walked all the way to the cliffs; and little Arthur walked the\r\ngreater part of it too; for he was now much more hardy and active than\r\nwhen he first entered the neighbourhood, and he did not like being in\r\nthe carriage with strangers, while all his four friends, mamma, and\r\nSancho, and Mr. Markham, and Miss Millward, were on foot, journeying\r\nfar behind, or passing through distant fields and lanes.\r\n\r\nI have a very pleasant recollection of that walk, along the hard,\r\nwhite, sunny road, shaded here and there with bright green trees, and\r\nadorned with flowery banks and blossoming hedges of delicious\r\nfragrance; or through pleasant fields and lanes, all glorious in the\r\nsweet flowers and brilliant verdure of delightful May. It was true,\r\nEliza was not beside me; but she was with her friends in the\r\npony-carriage, as happy, I trusted, as I was; and even when we\r\npedestrians, having forsaken the highway for a short cut across the\r\nfields, beheld the little carriage far away, disappearing amid the\r\ngreen, embowering trees, I did not hate those trees for snatching the\r\ndear little bonnet and shawl from my sight, nor did I feel that all\r\nthose intervening objects lay between my happiness and me; for, to\r\nconfess the truth, I was too happy in the company of Mrs. Graham to\r\nregret the absence of Eliza Millward.\r\n\r\nThe former, it is true, was most provokingly unsociable at\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94seemingly bent upon talking to no one but Mary Millward and\r\nArthur. She and Mary journeyed along together, generally with the child\r\nbetween them;\xe2\x80\x94but where the road permitted, I always walked on the\r\nother side of her, Richard Wilson taking the other side of Miss\r\nMillward, and Fergus roving here and there according to his fancy; and,\r\nafter a while, she became more friendly, and at length I succeeded in\r\nsecuring her attention almost entirely to myself\xe2\x80\x94and then I was happy\r\nindeed; for whenever she did condescend to converse, I liked to listen.\r\nWhere her opinions and sentiments tallied with mine, it was her extreme\r\ngood sense, her exquisite taste and feeling, that delighted me; where\r\nthey differed, it was still her uncompromising boldness in the avowal\r\nor defence of that difference, her earnestness and keenness, that\r\npiqued my fancy: and even when she angered me by her unkind words or\r\nlooks, and her uncharitable conclusions respecting me, it only made me\r\nthe more dissatisfied with myself for having so unfavourably impressed\r\nher, and the more desirous to vindicate my character and disposition in\r\nher eyes, and, if possible, to win her esteem.\r\n\r\nAt length our walk was ended. The increasing height and boldness of the\r\nhills had for some time intercepted the prospect; but, on gaining the\r\nsummit of a steep acclivity, and looking downward, an opening lay\r\nbefore us\xe2\x80\x94and the blue sea burst upon our sight!\xe2\x80\x94deep violet blue\xe2\x80\x94not\r\ndeadly calm, but covered with glinting breakers\xe2\x80\x94diminutive white specks\r\ntwinkling on its bosom, and scarcely to be distinguished, by the\r\nkeenest vision, from the little seamews that sported above, their white\r\nwings glittering in the sunshine: only one or two vessels were visible,\r\nand those were far away.\r\n\r\nI looked at my companion to see what she thought of this glorious\r\nscene. She said nothing: but she stood still, and fixed her eyes upon\r\nit with a gaze that assured me she was not disappointed. She had very\r\nfine eyes, by-the-by\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I have told you before, but\r\nthey were full of soul, large, clear, and nearly black\xe2\x80\x94not brown, but\r\nvery dark grey. A cool, reviving breeze blew from the sea\xe2\x80\x94soft, pure,\r\nsalubrious: it waved her drooping ringlets, and imparted a livelier\r\ncolour to her usually too pallid lip and cheek. She felt its\r\nexhilarating influence, and so did I\xe2\x80\x94I felt it tingling through my\r\nframe, but dared not give way to it while she remained so quiet. There\r\nwas an aspect of subdued exhilaration in her face, that kindled into\r\nalmost a smile of exalted, glad intelligence as her eye met mine. Never\r\nhad she looked so lovely: never had my heart so warmly cleaved to her\r\nas now. Had we been left two minutes longer standing there alone, I\r\ncannot answer for the consequences. Happily for my discretion, perhaps\r\nfor my enjoyment during the remainder of the day, we were speedily\r\nsummoned to the repast\xe2\x80\x94a very respectable collation, which Rose,\r\nassisted by Miss Wilson and Eliza, who, having shared her seat in the\r\ncarriage, had arrived with her a little before the rest, had set out\r\nupon an elevated platform overlooking the sea, and sheltered from the\r\nhot sun by a shelving rock and overhanging trees.\r\n\r\nMrs. Graham seated herself at a distance from me. Eliza was my nearest\r\nneighbour. She exerted herself to be agreeable, in her gentle,\r\nunobtrusive way, and was, no doubt, as fascinating and charming as\r\never, if I could only have felt it. But soon my heart began to warm\r\ntowards her once again; and we were all very merry and happy\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94as far as I could see\xe2\x80\x94throughout the protracted social meal.\r\n\r\nWhen that was over, Rose summoned Fergus to help her to gather up the\r\nfragments, and the knives, dishes, &c., and restore them to the\r\nbaskets; and Mrs. Graham took her camp-stool and drawing materials; and\r\nhaving begged Miss Millward to take charge of her precious son, and\r\nstrictly enjoined him not to wander from his new guardian\xe2\x80\x99s side, she\r\nleft us and proceeded along the steep, stony hill, to a loftier, more\r\nprecipitous eminence at some distance, whence a still finer prospect\r\nwas to be had, where she preferred taking her sketch, though some of\r\nthe ladies told her it was a frightful place, and advised her not to\r\nattempt it.\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, I felt as if there was to be no more fun\xe2\x80\x94though it\r\nis difficult to say what she had contributed to the hilarity of the\r\nparty. No jests, and little laughter, had escaped her lips; but her\r\nsmile had animated my mirth; a keen observation or a cheerful word from\r\nher had insensibly sharpened my wits, and thrown an interest over all\r\nthat was done and said by the rest. Even my conversation with Eliza had\r\nbeen enlivened by her presence, though I knew it not; and now that she\r\nwas gone, Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s playful nonsense ceased to amuse me\xe2\x80\x94nay, grew\r\nwearisome to my soul, and I grew weary of amusing her: I felt myself\r\ndrawn by an irresistible attraction to that distant point where the\r\nfair artist sat and plied her solitary task\xe2\x80\x94and not long did I attempt\r\nto resist it: while my little neighbour was exchanging a few words with\r\nMiss Wilson, I rose and cannily slipped away. A few rapid strides, and\r\na little active clambering, soon brought me to the place where she was\r\nseated\xe2\x80\x94a narrow ledge of rock at the very verge of the cliff, which\r\ndescended with a steep, precipitous slant, quite down to the rocky\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nShe did not hear me coming: the falling of my shadow across her paper\r\ngave her an electric start; and she looked hastily round\xe2\x80\x94any other lady\r\nof my acquaintance would have screamed under such a sudden alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was you.\xe2\x80\x94Why did you startle me so?\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\nsomewhat testily. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate anybody to come upon me so unexpectedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what did you take me for?\xe2\x80\x9d said I: \xe2\x80\x9cif I had known you were so\r\nnervous, I would have been more cautious; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind. What did you come for? are they all coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; this little ledge could scarcely contain them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad, for I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk. I\xe2\x80\x99ll only sit and watch your drawing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll content myself with admiring this magnificent prospect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no objection to this; and, for some time, sketched away in\r\nsilence. But I could not help stealing a glance, now and then, from the\r\nsplendid view at our feet to the elegant white hand that held the\r\npencil, and the graceful neck and glossy raven curls that drooped over\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cif I had but a pencil and a morsel of paper, I could\r\nmake a lovelier sketch than hers, admitting I had the power to\r\ndelineate faithfully what is before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, though this satisfaction was denied me, I was very well content to\r\nsit beside her there, and say nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you there still, Mr. Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d said she at length, looking round\r\nupon me\xe2\x80\x94for I was seated a little behind on a mossy projection of the\r\ncliff.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go and amuse yourself with your friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am tired of them, like you; and I shall have enough of them\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94or at any time hence; but you I may not have the pleasure of\r\nseeing again for I know not how long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was Arthur doing when you came away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was with Miss Millward, where you left him\xe2\x80\x94all right, but hoping\r\nmamma would not be long away. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t intrust him to me, by-the-by,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI grumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I had the honour of a much longer acquaintance; but\r\nMiss Millward has the art of conciliating and amusing children,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncarelessly added, \xe2\x80\x9cif she is good for nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Millward has many estimable qualities, which such as you cannot\r\nbe expected to perceive or appreciate. Will you tell Arthur that I\r\nshall come in a few minutes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that be the case, I will wait, with your permission, till those few\r\nminutes are past; and then I can assist you to descend this difficult\r\npath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you\xe2\x80\x94I always manage best, on such occasions, without\r\nassistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, at least, I can carry your stool and sketch-book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not deny me this favour; but I was rather offended at her\r\nevident desire to be rid of me, and was beginning to repent of my\r\npertinacity, when she somewhat appeased me by consulting my taste and\r\njudgment about some doubtful matter in her drawing. My opinion,\r\nhappily, met her approbation, and the improvement I suggested was\r\nadopted without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often wished in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cfor another\xe2\x80\x99s judgment to\r\nappeal to when I could scarcely trust the direction of my own eye and\r\nhead, they having been so long occupied with the contemplation of a\r\nsingle object as to become almost incapable of forming a proper idea\r\nrespecting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cis only one of many evils to which a solitary life\r\nexposes us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; and again we relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nAbout two minutes after, however, she declared her sketch completed,\r\nand closed the book.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the scene of our repast we found all the company had\r\ndeserted it, with the exception of three\xe2\x80\x94Mary Millward, Richard Wilson,\r\nand Arthur Graham. The younger gentleman lay fast asleep with his head\r\npillowed on the lady\xe2\x80\x99s lap; the other was seated beside her with a\r\npocket edition of some classic author in his hand. He never went\r\nanywhere without such a companion wherewith to improve his leisure\r\nmoments: all time seemed lost that was not devoted to study, or\r\nexacted, by his physical nature, for the bare support of life. Even now\r\nhe could not abandon himself to the enjoyment of that pure air and\r\nbalmy sunshine\xe2\x80\x94that splendid prospect, and those soothing sounds, the\r\nmusic of the waves and of the soft wind in the sheltering trees above\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94not even with a lady by his side (though not a very charming one, I\r\nwill allow)\xe2\x80\x94he must pull out his book, and make the most of his time\r\nwhile digesting his temperate meal, and reposing his weary limbs,\r\nunused to so much exercise.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, he spared a moment to exchange a word or a glance\r\nwith his companion now and then\xe2\x80\x94at any rate, she did not appear at all\r\nresentful of his conduct; for her homely features wore an expression of\r\nunusual cheerfulness and serenity, and she was studying his pale,\r\nthoughtful face with great complacency when we arrived.\r\n\r\nThe journey homeward was by no means so agreeable to me as the former\r\npart of the day: for now Mrs. Graham was in the carriage, and Eliza\r\nMillward was the companion of my walk. She had observed my preference\r\nfor the young widow, and evidently felt herself neglected. She did not\r\nmanifest her chagrin by keen reproaches, bitter sarcasms, or pouting\r\nsullen silence\xe2\x80\x94any or all of these I could easily have endured, or\r\nlightly laughed away; but she showed it by a kind of gentle melancholy,\r\na mild, reproachful sadness that cut me to the heart. I tried to cheer\r\nher up, and apparently succeeded in some degree, before the walk was\r\nover; but in the very act my conscience reproved me, knowing, as I did,\r\nthat, sooner or later, the tie must be broken, and this was only\r\nnourishing false hopes and putting off the evil day.\r\n\r\nWhen the pony-carriage had approached as near Wildfell Hall as the road\r\nwould permit\xe2\x80\x94unless, indeed, it proceeded up the long rough lane, which\r\nMrs. Graham would not allow\xe2\x80\x94the young widow and her son alighted,\r\nrelinquishing the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat to Rose; and I persuaded Eliza to take\r\nthe latter\xe2\x80\x99s place. Having put her comfortably in, bid her take care of\r\nthe evening air, and wished her a kind good-night, I felt considerably\r\nrelieved, and hastened to offer my services to Mrs. Graham to carry her\r\napparatus up the fields, but she had already hung her camp-stool on her\r\narm and taken her sketch-book in her hand, and insisted upon bidding me\r\nadieu then and there, with the rest of the company. But this time she\r\ndeclined my proffered aid in so kind and friendly a manner that I\r\nalmost forgave her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSix weeks had passed away. It was a splendid morning about the close of\r\nJune. Most of the hay was cut, but the last week had been very\r\nunfavourable; and now that fine weather was come at last, being\r\ndetermined to make the most of it, I had gathered all hands together\r\ninto the hay-field, and was working away myself, in the midst of them,\r\nin my shirt-sleeves, with a light, shady straw hat on my head, catching\r\nup armfuls of moist, reeking grass, and shaking it out to the four\r\nwinds of heaven, at the head of a goodly file of servants and\r\nhirelings\xe2\x80\x94intending so to labour, from morning till night, with as much\r\nzeal and assiduity as I could look for from any of them, as well to\r\nprosper the work by my own exertion as to animate the workers by my\r\nexample\xe2\x80\x94when lo! my resolutions were overthrown in a moment, by the\r\nsimple fact of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s running up to me and putting into my hand a\r\nsmall parcel, just arrived from London, which I had been for some time\r\nexpecting. I tore off the cover, and disclosed an elegant and portable\r\nedition of \xe2\x80\x9cMarmion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess I know who that\xe2\x80\x99s for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fergus, who stood looking on\r\nwhile I complacently examined the volume. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for Miss Eliza, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pronounced this with a tone and look so prodigiously knowing, that I\r\nwas glad to contradict him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wrong, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and, taking up my coat, I deposited the\r\nbook in one of its pockets, and then put it on (_i.e._ the coat). \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\ncome here, you idle dog, and make yourself useful for once,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cPull off your coat, and take my place in the field till I\r\ncome back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill you come back?\xe2\x80\x94and where are you going, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter\xe2\x80\x94_where_\xe2\x80\x94the _when_ is all that concerns you;\xe2\x80\x94and I shall be\r\nback by dinner, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94oh! and I\xe2\x80\x99m to labour away till then, am I?\xe2\x80\x94and to keep all these\r\nfellows hard at it besides? Well, well! I\xe2\x80\x99ll submit\xe2\x80\x94for once in a\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x94Come, my lads, you must look sharp: _I_\xe2\x80\x99m come to help you\r\nnow:\xe2\x80\x94and woe be to that man, or woman either, that pauses for a moment\r\namongst you\xe2\x80\x94whether to stare about him, to scratch his head, or blow\r\nhis nose\xe2\x80\x94no pretext will serve\xe2\x80\x94nothing but work, work, work in the\r\nsweat of your face,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., &c.\r\n\r\nLeaving him thus haranguing the people, more to their amusement than\r\nedification, I returned to the house, and, having made some alteration\r\nin my toilet, hastened away to Wildfell Hall, with the book in my\r\npocket; for it was destined for the shelves of Mrs. Graham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! then had she and you got on so well together as to come to the\r\ngiving and receiving of presents?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Not precisely, old buck; this was my\r\nfirst experiment in that line; and I was very anxious to see the result\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nWe had met several times since the \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Bay excursion, and I had found\r\nshe was not averse to my company, provided I confined my conversation\r\nto the discussion of abstract matters, or topics of common\r\ninterest;\xe2\x80\x94the moment I touched upon the sentimental or the\r\ncomplimentary, or made the slightest approach to tenderness in word or\r\nlook, I was not only punished by an immediate change in her manner at\r\nthe time, but doomed to find her more cold and distant, if not entirely\r\ninaccessible, when next I sought her company. This circumstance did not\r\ngreatly disconcert me, however, because I attributed it, not so much to\r\nany dislike of my person, as to some absolute resolution against a\r\nsecond marriage formed prior to the time of our acquaintance, whether\r\nfrom excess of affection for her late husband, or because she had had\r\nenough of him and the matrimonial state together. At first, indeed, she\r\nhad seemed to take a pleasure in mortifying my vanity and crushing my\r\npresumption\xe2\x80\x94relentlessly nipping off bud by bud as they ventured to\r\nappear; and then, I confess, I was deeply wounded, though, at the same\r\ntime, stimulated to seek revenge;\xe2\x80\x94but latterly finding, beyond a doubt,\r\nthat I was not that empty-headed coxcomb she had first supposed me, she\r\nhad repulsed my modest advances in quite a different spirit. It was a\r\nkind of serious, almost sorrowful displeasure, which I soon learnt\r\ncarefully to avoid awakening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me first establish my position as a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe patron\r\nand playfellow of her son, the sober, solid, plain-dealing friend of\r\nherself, and then, when I have made myself fairly necessary to her\r\ncomfort and enjoyment in life (as I believe I can), we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what next\r\nmay be effected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we talked about painting, poetry, and music, theology, geology, and\r\nphilosophy: once or twice I lent her a book, and once she lent me one\r\nin return: I met her in her walks as often as I could; I came to her\r\nhouse as often as I dared. My first pretext for invading the sanctum\r\nwas to bring Arthur a little waddling puppy of which Sancho was the\r\nfather, and which delighted the child beyond expression, and,\r\nconsequently, could not fail to please his mamma. My second was to\r\nbring him a book, which, knowing his mother\xe2\x80\x99s particularity, I had\r\ncarefully selected, and which I submitted for her approbation before\r\npresenting it to him. Then, I brought her some plants for her garden,\r\nin my sister\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94having previously persuaded Rose to send them. Each\r\nof these times I inquired after the picture she was painting from the\r\nsketch taken on the cliff, and was admitted into the studio, and asked\r\nmy opinion or advice respecting its progress.\r\n\r\nMy last visit had been to return the book she had lent me; and then it\r\nwas that, in casually discussing the poetry of Sir Walter Scott, she\r\nhad expressed a wish to see \xe2\x80\x9cMarmion,\xe2\x80\x9d and I had conceived the\r\npresumptuous idea of making her a present of it, and, on my return\r\nhome, instantly sent for the smart little volume I had this morning\r\nreceived. But an apology for invading the hermitage was still\r\nnecessary; so I had furnished myself with a blue morocco collar for\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s little dog; and that being given and received, with much more\r\njoy and gratitude, on the part of the receiver, than the worth of the\r\ngift or the selfish motive of the giver deserved, I ventured to ask\r\nMrs. Graham for one more look at the picture, if it was still there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said she (for I had met them in the garden). \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nfinished and framed, all ready for sending away; but give me your last\r\nopinion, and if you can suggest any further improvement, it shall\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94duly considered, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe picture was strikingly beautiful; it was the very scene itself,\r\ntransferred as if by magic to the canvas; but I expressed my\r\napprobation in guarded terms, and few words, for fear of displeasing\r\nher. She, however, attentively watched my looks, and her artist\xe2\x80\x99s pride\r\nwas gratified, no doubt, to read my heartfelt admiration in my eyes.\r\nBut, while I gazed, I thought upon the book, and wondered how it was to\r\nbe presented. My heart failed me; but I determined not to be such a\r\nfool as to come away without having made the attempt. It was useless\r\nwaiting for an opportunity, and useless trying to concoct a speech for\r\nthe occasion. The more plainly and naturally the thing was done, the\r\nbetter, I thought; so I just looked out of the window to screw up my\r\ncourage, and then pulled out the book, turned round, and put it into\r\nher hand, with this short explanation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were wishing to see \xe2\x80\x9cMarmion,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Graham; and here it is, if you\r\nwill be so kind as to take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA momentary blush suffused her face\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, a blush of sympathetic\r\nshame for such an awkward style of presentation: she gravely examined\r\nthe volume on both sides; then silently turned over the leaves,\r\nknitting her brows the while, in serious cogitation; then closed the\r\nbook, and turning from it to me, quietly asked the price of it\xe2\x80\x94I felt\r\nthe hot blood rush to my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to offend you, Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cbut unless I pay for\r\nthe book, I cannot take it.\xe2\x80\x9d And she laid it on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy cannot you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she paused, and looked at the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy cannot you?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, with a degree of irascibility that roused\r\nher to lift her eyes and look me steadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to put myself under obligations that I can never\r\nrepay\xe2\x80\x94I _am_ obliged to you already for your kindness to my son; but\r\nhis grateful affection and your own good feelings must reward you for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated I.\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes on me again, with a look of quiet, grave surprise,\r\nthat had the effect of a rebuke, whether intended for such or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t take the book?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, more mildly than I had yet\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will gladly take it, if you will let me pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d I told her the\r\nexact price, and the cost of the carriage besides, in as calm a tone as\r\nI could command\xe2\x80\x94for, in fact, I was ready to weep with disappointment\r\nand vexation.\r\n\r\nShe produced her purse, and coolly counted out the money, but hesitated\r\nto put it into my hand. Attentively regarding me, in a tone of soothing\r\nsoftness, she observed,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou think yourself insulted, Mr Markham\xe2\x80\x94I wish\r\nI could make you understand that\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do understand you, perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think that if you were\r\nto accept that trifle from me now, I should presume upon it hereafter;\r\nbut you are mistaken:\xe2\x80\x94if you will only oblige me by taking it, believe\r\nme, I shall build no hopes upon it, and consider this no precedent for\r\nfuture favours:\xe2\x80\x94and it is nonsense to talk about putting yourself under\r\nobligations to me when you must know that in such a case the obligation\r\nis entirely on my side,\xe2\x80\x94the favour on yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you at your word,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with a most\r\nangelic smile, returning the odious money to her purse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\n_remember!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will remember\xe2\x80\x94what I have said;\xe2\x80\x94but do not you punish my presumption\r\nby withdrawing your friendship entirely from me,\xe2\x80\x94or expect me to atone\r\nfor it by being _more_ distant than before,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, extending my hand\r\nto take leave, for I was too much excited to remain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then! let us be as we were,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, frankly placing her\r\nhand in mine; and while I held it there, I had much difficulty to\r\nrefrain from pressing it to my lips;\xe2\x80\x94but that would be suicidal\r\nmadness: I had been bold enough already, and this premature offering\r\nhad well-nigh given the death-blow to my hopes.\r\n\r\nIt was with an agitated, burning heart and brain that I hurried\r\nhomewards, regardless of that scorching noonday sun\xe2\x80\x94forgetful of\r\neverything but her I had just left\xe2\x80\x94regretting nothing but her\r\nimpenetrability, and my own precipitancy and want of tact\xe2\x80\x94fearing\r\nnothing but her hateful resolution, and my inability to overcome\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94hoping nothing\xe2\x80\x94but halt,\xe2\x80\x94I will not bore you with my conflicting\r\nhopes and fears\xe2\x80\x94my serious cogitations and resolves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThough my affections might now be said to be fairly weaned from Eliza\r\nMillward, I did not yet entirely relinquish my visits to the vicarage,\r\nbecause I wanted, as it were, to let her down easy; without raising\r\nmuch sorrow, or incurring much resentment,\xe2\x80\x94or making myself the talk of\r\nthe parish; and besides, if I had wholly kept away, the vicar, who\r\nlooked upon my visits as paid chiefly, if not entirely, to himself,\r\nwould have felt himself decidedly affronted by the neglect. But when I\r\ncalled there the day after my interview with Mrs. Graham, he happened\r\nto be from home\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance by no means so agreeable to me now as it\r\nhad been on former occasions. Miss Millward was there, it is true, but\r\nshe, of course, would be little better than a nonentity. However, I\r\nresolved to make my visit a short one, and to talk to Eliza in a\r\nbrotherly, friendly sort of way, such as our long acquaintance might\r\nwarrant me in assuming, and which, I thought, could neither give\r\noffence nor serve to encourage false hopes.\r\n\r\nIt was never my custom to talk about Mrs. Graham either to her or any\r\none else; but I had not been seated three minutes before she brought\r\nthat lady on to the carpet herself in a rather remarkable manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a shocked expression and voice\r\nsubdued almost to a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of these shocking\r\nreports about Mrs. Graham?\xe2\x80\x94can you encourage us to disbelieve them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reports?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now! _you_ know!\xe2\x80\x9d she slily smiled and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about them. What in the world do you mean, Eliza?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask _me!\xe2\x80\x94I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it.\xe2\x80\x9d She took up the cambric\r\nhandkerchief which she had been beautifying with a deep lace border,\r\nand began to be very busy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Miss Millward? what does she mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, appealing to\r\nher sister, who seemed to be absorbed in the hemming of a large, coarse\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she. \xe2\x80\x9cSome idle slander somebody has been\r\ninventing, I suppose. I never heard it till Eliza told me the other\r\nday,\xe2\x80\x94but if all the parish dinned it in my ears, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe a\r\nword of it\xe2\x80\x94I know Mrs. Graham too well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, Miss Millward!\xe2\x80\x94and so do I\xe2\x80\x94whatever it may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Eliza, with a gentle sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s well to have such a\r\ncomfortable assurance regarding the worth of those we love. I only wish\r\nyou may not find your confidence misplaced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she raised her face, and gave me such a look of sorrowful\r\ntenderness as might have melted my heart, but within those eyes there\r\nlurked a something that I did not like; and I wondered how I ever could\r\nhave admired them\xe2\x80\x94her sister\xe2\x80\x99s honest face and small grey optics\r\nappeared far more agreeable. But I was out of temper with Eliza at that\r\nmoment for her insinuations against Mrs. Graham, which were false, I\r\nwas certain, whether she knew it or not.\r\n\r\nI said nothing more on the subject, however, at the time, and but\r\nlittle on any other; for, finding I could not well recover my\r\nequanimity, I presently rose and took leave, excusing myself under the\r\nplea of business at the farm; and to the farm I went, not troubling my\r\nmind one whit about the possible truth of these mysterious reports, but\r\nonly wondering what they were, by whom originated, and on what\r\nfoundations raised, and how they could the most effectually be silenced\r\nor disproved.\r\n\r\nA few days after this we had another of our quiet little parties, to\r\nwhich the usual company of friends and neighbours had been invited, and\r\nMrs. Graham among the number. She could not now absent herself under\r\nthe plea of dark evenings or inclement weather, and, greatly to my\r\nrelief, she came. Without her I should have found the whole affair an\r\nintolerable bore; but the moment of her arrival brought new life to the\r\nhouse, and though I might not neglect the other guests for her, or\r\nexpect to engross much of her attention and conversation to myself\r\nalone, I anticipated an evening of no common enjoyment.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence came too. He did not arrive till some time after the rest\r\nwere assembled. I was curious to see how he would comport himself to\r\nMrs. Graham. A slight bow was all that passed between them on his\r\nentrance; and having politely greeted the other members of the company,\r\nhe seated himself quite aloof from the young widow, between my mother\r\nand Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see such art?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Eliza, who was my nearest\r\nneighbour. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you not say they were perfect strangers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost; but what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then; why, you can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be ignorant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIgnorant of _what?_\xe2\x80\x9d demanded I, so sharply that she started and\r\nreplied,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hush! don\xe2\x80\x99t speak so loud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, tell me then,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered in a lower tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it you mean?\r\nI hate enigmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t vouch for the truth of it\xe2\x80\x94indeed, far from\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94but haven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard _nothing_, except from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be wilfully deaf then, for anyone will tell you that; but I\r\nshall only anger you by repeating it, I see, so I had better hold my\r\ntongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed her lips and folded her hands before her, with an air of\r\ninjured meekness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had wished not to anger me, you should have held your tongue\r\nfrom the beginning, or else spoken out plainly and honestly all you had\r\nto say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned aside her face, pulled out her handkerchief, rose, and went\r\nto the window, where she stood for some time, evidently dissolved in\r\ntears. I was astounded, provoked, ashamed\xe2\x80\x94not so much of my harshness\r\nas for her childish weakness. However, no one seemed to notice her, and\r\nshortly after we were summoned to the tea-table: in those parts it was\r\ncustomary to sit to the table at tea-time on all occasions, and make a\r\nmeal of it, for we dined early. On taking my seat, I had Rose on one\r\nside of me and an empty chair on the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I sit by you?\xe2\x80\x9d said a soft voice at my elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; and Eliza slipped into the vacant chair;\r\nthen, looking up in my face with a half-sad, half-playful smile, she\r\nwhispered,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re so stern, Gilbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI handed down her tea with a slightly contemptuous smile, and said\r\nnothing, for I had nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done to offend you?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, more plaintively. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\r\nknew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, take your tea, Eliza, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish,\xe2\x80\x9d responded I,\r\nhanding her the sugar and cream.\r\n\r\nJust then there arose a slight commotion on the other side of me,\r\noccasioned by Miss Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s coming to negotiate an exchange of seats\r\nwith Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be so good as to exchange places with me, Miss Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to sit by Mrs. Graham. If your mamma thinks\r\nproper to invite such persons to her house, she cannot object to her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s keeping company with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis latter clause was added in a sort of soliloquy when Rose was gone;\r\nbut I was not polite enough to let it pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be so good as to tell me what you mean, Miss Wilson?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nThe question startled her a little, but not much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, coolly, having quickly recovered her\r\nself-possession, \xe2\x80\x9cit surprises me rather that Mrs. Markham should\r\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Graham to her house; but, perhaps, she is\r\nnot aware that the lady\xe2\x80\x99s character is considered scarcely\r\nrespectable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not, nor am I; and therefore you would oblige me by explaining\r\nyour meaning a little further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is scarcely the time or the place for such explanations; but I\r\nthink you can hardly be so ignorant as you pretend\xe2\x80\x94you must know her as\r\nwell as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do, perhaps a little better; and therefore, if you will\r\ninform me what you have heard or imagined against her, I shall,\r\nperhaps, be able to set you right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me, then, who was her husband, or if she ever had any?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndignation kept me silent. At such a time and place I could not trust\r\nmyself to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never observed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eliza, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a striking likeness there\r\nis between that child of hers and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whom?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Miss Wilson, with an air of cold, but keen\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\nEliza was startled; the timidly spoken suggestion had been intended for\r\nmy ear alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded she; \xe2\x80\x9cI may be mistaken\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I\r\n_was_ mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d But she accompanied the words with a sly glance of\r\nderision directed to me from the corner of her disingenuous eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need to ask _my_ pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her friend, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I see no\r\none here that at all resembles that child, except his mother, and when\r\nyou hear ill-natured reports, Miss Eliza, I will thank you, that is, I\r\nthink you will do well, to refrain from repeating them. I presume the\r\nperson you allude to is Mr. Lawrence; but I think I can assure you that\r\nyour suspicions, in that respect, are utterly misplaced; and if he has\r\nany particular connection with the lady at all (which no one has a\r\nright to assert), at least he has (what cannot be said of some others)\r\nsufficient sense of propriety to withhold him from acknowledging\r\nanything more than a bowing acquaintance in the presence of respectable\r\npersons; he was evidently both surprised and annoyed to find her here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fergus, who sat on the other side of Eliza, and was the\r\nonly individual who shared that side of the table with us. \xe2\x80\x9cGo it like\r\nbricks! mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave her one stone upon another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Wilson drew herself up with a look of freezing scorn, but said\r\nnothing. Eliza would have replied, but I interrupted her by saying as\r\ncalmly as I could, though in a tone which betrayed, no doubt, some\r\nlittle of what I felt within,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWe have had enough of this subject; if\r\nwe can only speak to slander our betters, let us hold our tongues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d better,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Fergus, \xe2\x80\x9cand so does our good parson;\r\nhe has been addressing the company in his richest vein all the while,\r\nand eyeing you, from time to time, with looks of stern distaste, while\r\nyou sat there, irreverently whispering and muttering together; and once\r\nhe paused in the middle of a story or a sermon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which, and\r\nfixed his eyes upon you, Gilbert, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98When Mr. Markham\r\nhas done flirting with those two ladies I will proceed.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat more was said at the tea-table I cannot tell, nor how I found\r\npatience to sit till the meal was over. I remember, however, that I\r\nswallowed with difficulty the remainder of the tea that was in my cup,\r\nand ate nothing; and that the first thing I did was to stare at Arthur\r\nGraham, who sat beside his mother on the opposite side of the table,\r\nand the second to stare at Mr. Lawrence, who sat below; and, first, it\r\nstruck me that there _was_ a likeness; but, on further contemplation, I\r\nconcluded it was only in imagination.\r\n\r\nBoth, it is true, had more delicate features and smaller bones than\r\ncommonly fall to the lot of individuals of the rougher sex, and\r\nLawrence\xe2\x80\x99s complexion was pale and clear, and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s delicately fair;\r\nbut Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s tiny, somewhat snubby nose could never become so long and\r\nstraight as Mr. Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s; and the outline of his face, though not\r\nfull enough to be round, and too finely converging to the small,\r\ndimpled chin to be square, could never be drawn out to the long oval of\r\nthe other\xe2\x80\x99s, while the child\xe2\x80\x99s hair was evidently of a lighter, warmer\r\ntint than the elder gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s had ever been, and his large, clear\r\nblue eyes, though prematurely serious at times, were utterly dissimilar\r\nto the shy hazel eyes of Mr. Lawrence, whence the sensitive soul looked\r\nso distrustfully forth, as ever ready to retire within, from the\r\noffences of a too rude, too uncongenial world. Wretch that I was to\r\nharbour that detestable idea for a moment! Did I not know Mrs. Graham?\r\nHad I not seen her, conversed with her time after time? Was I not\r\ncertain that she, in intellect, in purity and elevation of soul, was\r\nimmeasurably superior to any of her detractors; that she was, in fact,\r\nthe noblest, the most adorable, of her sex I had ever beheld, or even\r\nimagined to exist? Yes, and I would say with Mary Millward (sensible\r\ngirl as she was), that if all the parish, ay, or all the world, should\r\ndin these horrible lies in my ears, I would not believe them, for I\r\nknew her better than they.\r\n\r\nMeantime, my brain was on fire with indignation, and my heart seemed\r\nready to burst from its prison with conflicting passions. I regarded my\r\ntwo fair neighbours with a feeling of abhorrence and loathing I\r\nscarcely endeavoured to conceal. I was rallied from several quarters\r\nfor my abstraction and ungallant neglect of the ladies; but I cared\r\nlittle for that: all I cared about, besides that one grand subject of\r\nmy thoughts, was to see the cups travel up to the tea-tray, and not\r\ncome down again. I thought Mr. Millward never _would_ cease telling us\r\nthat he was no tea-drinker, and that it was highly injurious to keep\r\nloading the stomach with slops to the exclusion of more wholesome\r\nsustenance, and so give himself time to finish his fourth cup.\r\n\r\nAt length it was over; and I rose and left the table and the guests\r\nwithout a word of apology\xe2\x80\x94I could endure their company no longer. I\r\nrushed out to cool my brain in the balmy evening air, and to compose my\r\nmind or indulge my passionate thoughts in the solitude of the garden.\r\n\r\nTo avoid being seen from the windows I went down a quiet little avenue\r\nthat skirted one side of the inclosure, at the bottom of which was a\r\nseat embowered in roses and honeysuckles. Here I sat down to think over\r\nthe virtues and wrongs of the lady of Wildfell Hall; but I had not been\r\nso occupied two minutes, before voices and laughter, and glimpses of\r\nmoving objects through the trees, informed me that the whole company\r\nhad turned out to take an airing in the garden too. However, I nestled\r\nup in a corner of the bower, and hoped to retain possession of it,\r\nsecure alike from observation and intrusion. But no\xe2\x80\x94confound it\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas some one coming down the avenue! Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they enjoy the\r\nflowers and sunshine of the open garden, and leave that sunless nook to\r\nme, and the gnats and midges?\r\n\r\nBut, peeping through my fragrant screen of the interwoven branches to\r\ndiscover who the intruders were (for a murmur of voices told me it was\r\nmore than one), my vexation instantly subsided, and far other feelings\r\nagitated my still unquiet soul; for there was Mrs. Graham, slowly\r\nmoving down the walk with Arthur by her side, and no one else. Why were\r\nthey alone? Had the poison of detracting tongues already spread through\r\nall; and had they all turned their backs upon her? I now recollected\r\nhaving seen Mrs. Wilson, in the early part of the evening, edging her\r\nchair close up to my mother, and bending forward, evidently in the\r\ndelivery of some important confidential intelligence; and from the\r\nincessant wagging of her head, the frequent distortions of her wrinkled\r\nphysiognomy, and the winking and malicious twinkle of her little ugly\r\neyes, I judged it was some spicy piece of scandal that engaged her\r\npowers; and from the cautious privacy of the communication I supposed\r\nsome person then present was the luckless object of her calumnies: and\r\nfrom all these tokens, together with my mother\xe2\x80\x99s looks and gestures of\r\nmingled horror and incredulity, I now concluded that object to have\r\nbeen Mrs. Graham. I did not emerge from my place of concealment till\r\nshe had nearly reached the bottom of the walk, lest my appearance\r\nshould drive her away; and when I did step forward she stood still and\r\nseemed inclined to turn back as it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us disturb you, Mr. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWe came here to\r\nseek retirement ourselves, not to intrude on your seclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no hermit, Mrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x94though I own it looks rather like it to\r\nabsent myself in this uncourteous fashion from my guests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feared you were unwell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a look of real concern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was rather, but it\xe2\x80\x99s over now. Do sit here a little and rest, and\r\ntell me how you like this arbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, and, lifting Arthur by the\r\nshoulders, I planted him in the middle of the seat by way of securing\r\nhis mamma, who, acknowledging it to be a tempting place of refuge,\r\nthrew herself back in one corner, while I took possession of the other.\r\n\r\nBut that word refuge disturbed me. Had their unkindness then really\r\ndriven her to seek for peace in solitude?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have they left you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I who have left them,\xe2\x80\x9d was the smiling rejoinder. \xe2\x80\x9cI was wearied\r\nto death with small talk\xe2\x80\x94nothing wears me out like that. I cannot\r\nimagine how they _can_ go on as they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help smiling at the serious depth of her wonderment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it that they think it a _duty_ to be continually talking,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nshe: \xe2\x80\x9cand so never pause to think, but fill up with aimless trifles and\r\nvain repetitions when subjects of real interest fail to present\r\nthemselves, or do they really take a pleasure in such discourse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely they do,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9ctheir shallow minds can hold no great\r\nideas, and their light heads are carried away by trivialities that\r\nwould not move a better-furnished skull; and their only alternative to\r\nsuch discourse is to plunge over head and ears into the slough of\r\nscandal\xe2\x80\x94which is their chief delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot all of them, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lady, astonished at the bitterness\r\nof my remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly; I exonerate my sister from such degraded tastes, and my\r\nmother too, if you included _her_ in your animadversions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant no animadversions against any one, and certainly intended no\r\ndisrespectful allusions to your mother. I have known some sensible\r\npersons great adepts in that style of conversation when circumstances\r\nimpelled them to it; but it is a gift I cannot boast the possession of.\r\nI kept up my attention on this occasion as long as I could, but when my\r\npowers were exhausted I stole away to seek a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 repose in\r\nthis quiet walk. I hate talking where there is no exchange of ideas or\r\nsentiments, and no good given or received.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif ever I trouble you with my loquacity, tell me so at\r\nonce, and I promise not to be offended; for I possess the faculty of\r\nenjoying the company of those I\xe2\x80\x94of my friends as well in silence as in\r\nconversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite believe you; but if it were so you would exactly suit me\r\nfor a companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am all you wish, then, in other respects?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that. How beautiful those little clusters of foliage\r\nlook, where the sun comes through behind them!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, on purpose to\r\nchange the subject.\r\n\r\nAnd they did look beautiful, where at intervals the level rays of the\r\nsun penetrating the thickness of trees and shrubs on the opposite side\r\nof the path before us, relieved their dusky verdure by displaying\r\npatches of semi-transparent leaves of resplendent golden green.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost wish I were not a painter,\xe2\x80\x9d observed my companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so? one would think at such a time you would most exult in your\r\nprivilege of being able to imitate the various brilliant and delightful\r\ntouches of nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; for instead of delivering myself up to the full enjoyment of them\r\nas others do, I am always troubling my head about how I could produce\r\nthe same effect upon canvas; and as that can never be done, it is mere\r\nvanity and vexation of spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you cannot do it to satisfy yourself, but you may and do\r\nsucceed in delighting others with the result of your endeavours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, after all, I should not complain: perhaps few people gain their\r\nlivelihood with so much pleasure in their toil as I do. Here is some\r\none coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed vexed at the interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only Mr. Lawrence and Miss Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9ccoming to enjoy a\r\nquiet stroll. They will not disturb us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not quite decipher the expression of her face; but I was\r\nsatisfied there was no jealousy therein. What business had I to look\r\nfor it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a person is Miss Wilson?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is elegant and accomplished above the generality of her birth and\r\nstation; and some say she is ladylike and agreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought her somewhat frigid and rather supercilious in her manner\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely she might be so to you. She has possibly taken a prejudice\r\nagainst you, for I think she regards you in the light of a rival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! Impossible, Mr. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, evidently astonished and\r\nannoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I know nothing about it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I, rather doggedly; for I\r\nthought her annoyance was chiefly against myself.\r\n\r\nThe pair had now approached within a few paces of us. Our arbour was\r\nset snugly back in a corner, before which the avenue at its termination\r\nturned off into the more airy walk along the bottom of the garden. As\r\nthey approached this, I saw, by the aspect of Jane Wilson, that she was\r\ndirecting her companion\xe2\x80\x99s attention to us; and, as well by her cold,\r\nsarcastic smile as by the few isolated words of her discourse that\r\nreached me, I knew full well that she was impressing him with the idea,\r\nthat we were strongly attached to each other. I noticed that he\r\ncoloured up to the temples, gave us one furtive glance in passing, and\r\nwalked on, looking grave, but seemingly offering no reply to her\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nIt was true, then, that he _had_ some designs upon Mrs. Graham; and,\r\nwere they honourable, he would not be so anxious to conceal them. _She_\r\nwas blameless, of course, but he was detestable beyond all count.\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts flashed through my mind, my companion abruptly\r\nrose, and calling her son, said they would now go in quest of the\r\ncompany, and departed up the avenue. Doubtless she had heard or guessed\r\nsomething of Miss Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, and therefore it was natural enough\r\nshe should choose to continue the _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ no longer, especially\r\nas at that moment my cheeks were burning with indignation against my\r\nformer friend, the token of which she might mistake for a blush of\r\nstupid embarrassment. For this I owed Miss Wilson yet another grudge;\r\nand still the more I thought upon her conduct the more I hated her.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening before I joined the company. I found Mrs.\r\nGraham already equipped for departure, and taking leave of the rest,\r\nwho were now returned to the house. I offered, nay, begged to accompany\r\nher home. Mr. Lawrence was standing by at the time conversing with some\r\none else. He did not look at us, but, on hearing my earnest request, he\r\npaused in the middle of a sentence to listen for her reply, and went\r\non, with a look of quiet satisfaction, the moment he found it was to be\r\na denial.\r\n\r\nA denial it was, decided, though not unkind. She could not be persuaded\r\nto think there was danger for herself or her child in traversing those\r\nlonely lanes and fields without attendance. It was daylight still, and\r\nshe should meet no one; or if she did, the people were quiet and\r\nharmless she was well assured. In fact, she would not hear of any one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nputting himself out of the way to accompany her, though Fergus\r\nvouchsafed to offer his services in case they should be more acceptable\r\nthan mine, and my mother begged she might send one of the farming-men\r\nto escort her.\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone the rest was all a blank or worse. Lawrence attempted\r\nto draw me into conversation, but I snubbed him and went to another\r\npart of the room. Shortly after the party broke up and he himself took\r\nleave. When he came to me I was blind to his extended hand, and deaf to\r\nhis good-night till he repeated it a second time; and then, to get rid\r\nof him, I muttered an inarticulate reply, accompanied by a sulky nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered he.\r\n\r\nI replied by a wrathful and contemptuous stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry because Mrs. Graham would not let you go home with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked, with a faint smile that nearly exasperated me beyond control.\r\n\r\nBut, swallowing down all fiercer answers, I merely demanded,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nbusiness is it of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, none,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he with provoking quietness; \xe2\x80\x9conly,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he raised\r\nhis eyes to my face, and spoke with unusual solemnity,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly let me\r\ntell you, Markham, that if you have any designs in that quarter, they\r\nwill certainly fail; and it grieves me to see you cherishing false\r\nhopes, and wasting your strength in useless efforts, for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHypocrite!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed; and he held his breath, and looked very\r\nblank, turned white about the gills, and went away without another\r\nword.\r\n\r\nI had wounded him to the quick; and I was glad of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen all were gone, I learnt that the vile slander had indeed been\r\ncirculated throughout the company, in the very presence of the victim.\r\nRose, however, vowed she did not and would not believe it, and my\r\nmother made the same declaration, though not, I fear, with the same\r\namount of real, unwavering incredulity. It seemed to dwell continually\r\non her mind, and she kept irritating me from time to time by such\r\nexpressions as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear, who would have thought it!\xe2\x80\x94Well! I always\r\nthought there was something odd about her.\xe2\x80\x94You see what it is for women\r\nto affect to be different to other people.\xe2\x80\x9d And once it was,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI misdoubted that appearance of mystery from the very first\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n_thought_ there would no good come of it; but this is a sad, sad\r\nbusiness, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, mother, you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe these tales,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fergus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more I do, my dear; but then, you know, there must be some\r\nfoundation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foundation is in the wickedness and falsehood of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI, \xe2\x80\x9cand in the fact that Mr. Lawrence has been seen to go that way once\r\nor twice of an evening\xe2\x80\x94and the village gossips say he goes to pay his\r\naddresses to the strange lady, and the scandal-mongers have greedily\r\nseized the rumour, to make it the basis of their own infernal\r\nstructure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but, Gilbert, there must be something in her _manner_ to\r\ncountenance such reports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid _you_ see anything in her manner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly; but then, you know, I always said there was something\r\nstrange about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI believe it was on that very evening that I ventured on another\r\ninvasion of Wildfell Hall. From the time of our party, which was\r\nupwards of a week ago, I had been making daily efforts to meet its\r\nmistress in her walks; and always disappointed (she must have managed\r\nit so on purpose), had nightly kept revolving in my mind some pretext\r\nfor another call. At length I concluded that the separation could be\r\nendured no longer (by this time, you will see, I was pretty far gone);\r\nand, taking from the book-case an old volume that I thought she might\r\nbe interested in, though, from its unsightly and somewhat dilapidated\r\ncondition, I had not yet ventured to offer it for perusal, I hastened\r\naway,\xe2\x80\x94but not without sundry misgivings as to how she would receive me,\r\nor how I could summon courage to present myself with so slight an\r\nexcuse. But, perhaps, I might see her in the field or the garden, and\r\nthen there would be no great difficulty: it was the formal knocking at\r\nthe door, with the prospect of being gravely ushered in by Rachel, to\r\nthe presence of a surprised, uncordial mistress, that so greatly\r\ndisturbed me.\r\n\r\nMy wish, however, was not gratified. Mrs. Graham herself was not to be\r\nseen; but there was Arthur playing with his frolicsome little dog in\r\nthe garden. I looked over the gate and called him to me. He wanted me\r\nto come in; but I told him I could not without his mother\xe2\x80\x99s leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and ask her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Arthur, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t do that; but if she\xe2\x80\x99s not engaged, just\r\nask her to come here a minute. Tell her I want to speak to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ran to perform my bidding, and quickly returned with his mother. How\r\nlovely she looked with her dark ringlets streaming in the light summer\r\nbreeze, her fair cheek slightly flushed, and her countenance radiant\r\nwith smiles. Dear Arthur! what did I not owe to you for this and every\r\nother happy meeting? Through him I was at once delivered from all\r\nformality, and terror, and constraint. In love affairs, there is no\r\nmediator like a merry, simple-hearted child\xe2\x80\x94ever ready to cement\r\ndivided hearts, to span the unfriendly gulf of custom, to melt the ice\r\nof cold reserve, and overthrow the separating walls of dread formality\r\nand pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Markham, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young mother, accosting me\r\nwith a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to look at this book, and, if you please, to take it, and\r\nperuse it at your leisure. I make no apology for calling you out on\r\nsuch a lovely evening, though it _be_ for a matter of no greater\r\nimportance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him to come in, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to come in?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I should like to see your improvements in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how your sister\xe2\x80\x99s roots have prospered in my charge,\xe2\x80\x9d added she,\r\nas she opened the gate.\r\n\r\nAnd we sauntered through the garden, and talked of the flowers, the\r\ntrees, and the book, and then of other things. The evening was kind and\r\ngenial, and so was my companion. By degrees I waxed more warm and\r\ntender than, perhaps, I had ever been before; but still I said nothing\r\ntangible, and she attempted no repulse, until, in passing a moss\r\nrose-tree that I had brought her some weeks since, in my sister\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nshe plucked a beautiful half-open bud and bade me give it to Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I not keep it myself?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but here is another for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of taking it quietly, I likewise took the hand that offered it,\r\nand looked into her face. She let me hold it for a moment, and I saw a\r\nflash of ecstatic brilliance in her eye, a glow of glad excitement on\r\nher face\xe2\x80\x94I thought my hour of victory was come\xe2\x80\x94but instantly a painful\r\nrecollection seemed to flash upon her; a cloud of anguish darkened her\r\nbrow, a marble paleness blanched her cheek and lip; there seemed a\r\nmoment of inward conflict, and, with a sudden effort, she withdrew her\r\nhand, and retreated a step or two back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a kind of desperate calmness, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust tell you plainly that I cannot do with this. I like your company,\r\nbecause I am alone here, and your conversation pleases me more than\r\nthat of any other person; but if you cannot be content to regard me as\r\na friend\xe2\x80\x94a plain, cold, motherly, or sisterly friend\xe2\x80\x94I must beg you to\r\nleave me now, and let me alone hereafter: in fact, we must be strangers\r\nfor the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, then\xe2\x80\x94be your friend, or brother, or anything you wish, if you\r\nwill only let me continue to see you; but tell me why I cannot be\r\nanything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a perplexed and thoughtful pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it in consequence of some rash vow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is something of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cSome day I may tell you,\r\nbut at present you had better leave me; and never, Gilbert, put me to\r\nthe painful necessity of repeating what I have just now said to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe earnestly added, giving me her hand in serious kindness. How sweet,\r\nhow musical my own name sounded in her mouth!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you pardon _this_ offence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn condition that you never repeat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd may I come to see you now and then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94occasionally; provided you never abuse the privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make no empty promises, but you shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moment you do our intimacy is at an end, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you always call me Gilbert? It sounds more sisterly, and it\r\nwill serve to remind me of our contract.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and once more bid me go; and at length I judged it prudent\r\nto obey, and she re-entered the house and I went down the hill. But as\r\nI went the tramp of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs fell on my ear, and broke the\r\nstillness of the dewy evening; and, looking towards the lane, I saw a\r\nsolitary equestrian coming up. Inclining to dusk as it was, I knew him\r\nat a glance: it was Mr. Lawrence on his grey pony. I flew across the\r\nfield, leaped the stone fence, and then walked down the lane to meet\r\nhim. On seeing me, he suddenly drew in his little steed, and seemed\r\ninclined to turn back, but on second thought apparently judged it\r\nbetter to continue his course as before. He accosted me with a slight\r\nbow, and, edging close to the wall, endeavoured to pass on; but I was\r\nnot so minded. Seizing his horse by the bridle, I exclaimed,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nLawrence, I will have this mystery explained! Tell me where you are\r\ngoing, and what you mean to do\xe2\x80\x94at once, and distinctly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take your hand off the bridle?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, quietly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhurting my pony\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and your pony be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you so coarse and brutal, Markham? I\xe2\x80\x99m quite ashamed of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou answer my questions\xe2\x80\x94before you leave this spot! I _will_ know what\r\nyou mean by this perfidious duplicity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall answer no questions till you let go the bridle,\xe2\x80\x94if you stand\r\ntill morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, unclosing my hand, but still standing before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me some other time, when you can speak like a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nhe, and he made an effort to pass me again; but I quickly re-captured\r\nthe pony, scarce less astonished than its master at such uncivil usage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Mr. Markham, this is _too_ much!\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I not\r\ngo to see my tenant on matters of business, without being assaulted in\r\nthis manner by\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no time for business, sir!\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, now, what I think of\r\nyour conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better defer your opinion to a more convenient season,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterrupted he in a low tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s the vicar.\xe2\x80\x9d And, in truth, the\r\nvicar was just behind me, plodding homeward from some remote corner of\r\nhis parish. I immediately released the squire; and he went on his way,\r\nsaluting Mr. Millward as he passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! quarrelling, Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the latter, addressing himself to\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand about that young widow, I doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, reproachfully\r\nshaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut let me tell you, young man\xe2\x80\x9d (here he put his\r\nface into mine with an important, confidential air), \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s not worth\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d and he confirmed the assertion by a solemn nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMR. MILLWARD,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, in a tone of wrathful menace that made the\r\nreverend gentleman look round\xe2\x80\x94aghast\xe2\x80\x94astounded at such unwonted\r\ninsolence, and stare me in the face, with a look that plainly said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, this to me!\xe2\x80\x9d But I was too indignant to apologise, or to speak\r\nanother word to him: I turned away, and hastened homewards, descending\r\nwith rapid strides the steep, rough lane, and leaving him to follow as\r\nhe pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must suppose about three weeks passed over. Mrs. Graham and I were\r\nnow established friends\xe2\x80\x94or brother and sister, as we rather chose to\r\nconsider ourselves. She called me Gilbert, by my express desire, and I\r\ncalled her Helen, for I had seen that name written in her books. I\r\nseldom attempted to see her above twice a week; and still I made our\r\nmeetings appear the result of accident as often as I could\xe2\x80\x94for I found\r\nit necessary to be extremely careful\xe2\x80\x94and, altogether, I behaved with\r\nsuch exceeding propriety that she never had occasion to reprove me\r\nonce. Yet I could not but perceive that she was at times unhappy and\r\ndissatisfied with herself or her position, and truly I myself was not\r\nquite contented with the latter: this assumption of brotherly\r\nnonchalance was very hard to sustain, and I often felt myself a most\r\nconfounded hypocrite with it all; I saw too, or rather I felt, that, in\r\nspite of herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI was not indifferent to her,\xe2\x80\x9d as the novel heroes\r\nmodestly express it, and while I thankfully enjoyed my present good\r\nfortune, I could not fail to wish and hope for something better in\r\nfuture; but, of course, I kept such dreams entirely to myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, Gilbert?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, one evening, shortly after\r\ntea, when I had been busy with the farm all day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you always brush your hat so carefully, and do your hair so nicely,\r\nand put on such smart new gloves when you take a walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to Wildfell Hall, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you look as if you were\xe2\x80\x94but I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go so often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, child! I don\xe2\x80\x99t go once in six weeks\xe2\x80\x94what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but if I were you, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have so much to do with Mrs.\r\nGraham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Rose, are you, too, giving in to the prevailing opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned she, hesitatingly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard so much about her\r\nlately, both at the Wilsons\xe2\x80\x99 and the vicarage;\xe2\x80\x94and besides, mamma says,\r\nif she were a proper person she would not be living there by\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember last winter, Gilbert, all that about the\r\nfalse name to the picture; and how she explained it\xe2\x80\x94saying she had\r\nfriends or acquaintances from whom she wished her present residence to\r\nbe concealed, and that she was afraid of their tracing her out;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen, how suddenly she started up and left the room when that person\r\ncame\xe2\x80\x94whom she took good care not to let us catch a glimpse of, and who\r\nArthur, with such an air of mystery, told us was his mamma\xe2\x80\x99s friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Rose, I remember it all; and I can forgive your uncharitable\r\nconclusions; for, perhaps, if I did not know her myself, I should put\r\nall these things together, and believe the same as you do; but thank\r\nGod, I do know her; and I should be unworthy the name of a man, if I\r\ncould believe anything that was said against her, unless I heard it\r\nfrom her own lips.\xe2\x80\x94I should as soon believe such things of you, Rose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gilbert!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you think I _could_ believe anything of the kind,\xe2\x80\x94whatever\r\nthe Wilsons and Millwards dared to whisper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope _not_ indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not?\xe2\x80\x94Because I know you\xe2\x80\x94Well, and I know her just as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! you know nothing of her former life; and last year, at this\r\ntime, you did not know that such a person existed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter. There is such a thing as looking through a person\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\ninto the heart, and learning more of the height, and breadth, and depth\r\nof another\xe2\x80\x99s soul in one hour than it might take you a lifetime to\r\ndiscover, if he or she were not disposed to reveal it, or if you had\r\nnot the sense to understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you _are_ going to see her this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what would mamma say, Gilbert!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma needn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she must know some time, if you go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no going on in the matter. Mrs. Graham and I are two\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94and will be; and no man breathing shall hinder it,\xe2\x80\x94or has a\r\nright to interfere between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you knew how they talk you would be more careful, for her sake\r\nas well as for your own. Jane Wilson thinks your visits to the old hall\r\nbut another proof of her depravity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound Jane Wilson!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Eliza Millward is quite grieved about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, if I were you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t what?\xe2\x80\x94How do they know that I go there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing hid from them: they spy out everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I never thought of this!\xe2\x80\x94And so they dare to turn my friendship\r\ninto food for further scandal against her!\xe2\x80\x94That proves the falsehood of\r\ntheir other lies, at all events, if any proof were wanting.\xe2\x80\x94Mind you\r\ncontradict them, Rose, whenever you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they don\xe2\x80\x99t speak openly to me about such things: it is only by\r\nhints and innuendoes, and by what I hear others say, that I knew what\r\nthey think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go to-day, as it\xe2\x80\x99s getting latish. But oh, deuce\r\ntake their cursed, envenomed tongues!\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered, in the bitterness of\r\nmy soul.\r\n\r\nAnd just at that moment the vicar entered the room: we had been too\r\nmuch absorbed in our conversation to observe his knock. After his\r\ncustomary cheerful and fatherly greeting of Rose, who was rather a\r\nfavourite with the old gentleman, he turned somewhat sternly to me:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re quite a stranger. It is\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x94me\xe2\x80\x94see,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, slowly, as he deposited his ponderous bulk in the arm-chair\r\nthat Rose officiously brought towards him; \xe2\x80\x9cit is just\xe2\x80\x94six-weeks\xe2\x80\x94by my\r\nreckoning, since you darkened\xe2\x80\x94my\xe2\x80\x94door!\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke it with emphasis, and\r\nstruck his stick on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! It is so!\xe2\x80\x9d He added an affirmatory nod, and continued to gaze upon\r\nme with a kind of irate solemnity, holding his substantial stick\r\nbetween his knees, with his hands clasped upon its head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been busy,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, for an apology was evidently demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusy!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated he, derisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting in my hay; and now the harvest is\r\nbeginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then my mother came in, and created a diversion in my favour by\r\nher loquacious and animated welcome of the reverend guest. She\r\nregretted deeply that he had not come a little earlier, in time for\r\ntea, but offered to have some immediately prepared, if he would do her\r\nthe favour to partake of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot any for me, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be at home in a few\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but do stay and take a little! it will be ready in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he rejected the offer with a majestic wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll take, Mrs. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said he: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take a\r\nglass of your excellent ale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my mother, proceeding with alacrity to pull the\r\nbell and order the favoured beverage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d just look in upon you as I passed, and\r\ntaste your home-brewed ale. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to call on Mrs. Graham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded gravely, and added with awful emphasis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it\r\nincumbent upon me to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so, Mr. Millward?\xe2\x80\x9d asked I.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with some severity, and turning again to my mother,\r\nrepeated,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it incumbent upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d and struck his stick on the\r\nfloor again. My mother sat opposite, an awe-struck but admiring\r\nauditor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Graham,\xe2\x80\x99 said I,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, shaking his head as he spoke,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98these are terrible reports!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 says she, affecting to be\r\nignorant of my meaning. \xe2\x80\x98It is my\xe2\x80\x94duty\xe2\x80\x94as\xe2\x80\x94your pastor,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\ntell you both everything that I myself see reprehensible in your\r\nconduct, and all I have reason to suspect, and what others tell me\r\nconcerning you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94So I told her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, starting from my seat and striking my fist on\r\nthe table. He merely glanced towards me, and continued\xe2\x80\x94addressing his\r\nhostess:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a painful duty, Mrs. Markham\xe2\x80\x94but I told her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did she take it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardened, I fear\xe2\x80\x94hardened!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with a despondent shake of the\r\nhead; \xe2\x80\x9cand, at the same time, there was a strong display of\r\nunchastened, misdirected passions. She turned white in the face, and\r\ndrew her breath through her teeth in a savage sort of way;\xe2\x80\x94but she\r\noffered no extenuation or defence; and with a kind of shameless\r\ncalmness\xe2\x80\x94shocking indeed to witness in one so young\xe2\x80\x94as good as told me\r\nthat my remonstrance was unavailing, and my pastoral advice quite\r\nthrown away upon her\xe2\x80\x94nay, that my very _presence was_ displeasing while\r\nI spoke such things. And I withdrew at length, too plainly seeing that\r\nnothing could be done\xe2\x80\x94and sadly grieved to find her case so hopeless.\r\nBut I am fully determined, Mrs. Markham, that _my_\r\ndaughters\xe2\x80\x94shall\xe2\x80\x94not\xe2\x80\x94consort with her. Do you adopt the same resolution\r\nwith regard to yours!\xe2\x80\x94As for your sons\xe2\x80\x94as for _you_, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, sternly turning to me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for ME, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, but checked by some impediment in my\r\nutterance, and finding that my whole frame trembled with fury, I said\r\nno more, but took the wiser part of snatching up my hat and bolting\r\nfrom the room, slamming the door behind me, with a bang that shook the\r\nhouse to its foundations, and made my mother scream, and gave a\r\nmomentary relief to my excited feelings.\r\n\r\nThe next minute saw me hurrying with rapid strides in the direction of\r\nWildfell Hall\xe2\x80\x94to what intent or purpose I could scarcely tell, but I\r\nmust be moving somewhere, and no other goal would do\xe2\x80\x94I must see her\r\ntoo, and speak to her\xe2\x80\x94that was certain; but what to say, or how to act,\r\nI had no definite idea. Such stormy thoughts\xe2\x80\x94so many different\r\nresolutions crowded in upon me, that my mind was little better than a\r\nchaos of conflicting passions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn little more than twenty minutes the journey was accomplished. I\r\npaused at the gate to wipe my streaming forehead, and recover my breath\r\nand some degree of composure. Already the rapid walking had somewhat\r\nmitigated my excitement; and with a firm and steady tread I paced the\r\ngarden-walk. In passing the inhabited wing of the building, I caught a\r\nsight of Mrs. Graham, through the open window, slowly pacing up and\r\ndown her lonely room.\r\n\r\nShe seemed agitated and even dismayed at my arrival, as if she thought\r\nI too was coming to accuse her. I had entered her presence intending to\r\ncondole with her upon the wickedness of the world, and help her to\r\nabuse the vicar and his vile informants, but now I felt positively\r\nashamed to mention the subject, and determined not to refer to it,\r\nunless she led the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am come at an unseasonable hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, assuming a cheerfulness I\r\ndid not feel, in order to reassure her; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t stay many\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled upon me, faintly it is true, but most kindly\xe2\x80\x94I had almost\r\nsaid thankfully, as her apprehensions were removed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dismal you are, Helen! Why have you no fire?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, looking\r\nround on the gloomy apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is summer yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _we always_ have a fire in the evenings, if we can bear it; and\r\nyou especially require one in this cold house and dreary room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have come a little sooner, and I would have had one lighted\r\nfor you: but it is not worth while now\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t stay many minutes, you\r\nsay, and Arthur is gone to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have a fancy for a fire, nevertheless. Will you order one, if I\r\nring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Gilbert, you don\xe2\x80\x99t _look_ cold!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smilingly regarding my\r\nface, which no doubt seemed warm enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I want to see you comfortable before I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe comfortable!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated she, with a bitter laugh, as if there were\r\nsomething amusingly absurd in the idea. \xe2\x80\x9cIt suits me better as it is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, in a tone of mournful resignation.\r\n\r\nBut determined to have my own way, I pulled the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as the approaching steps of Rachel were\r\nheard in answer to the summons. There was nothing for it but to turn\r\nround and desire the maid to light the fire.\r\n\r\nI owe Rachel a grudge to this day for the look she cast upon me ere she\r\ndeparted on her mission, the sour, suspicious, inquisitorial look that\r\nplainly demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are _you_ here for, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d Her mistress did\r\nnot fail to notice it, and a shade of uneasiness darkened her brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not stay long, Gilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, when the door was closed\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, somewhat testily, though without a grain of\r\nanger in my heart against any one but the meddling old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nHelen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve something to say to you before I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not now\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet precisely what it is, or how to say it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied I, with more truth than wisdom; and then, fearing lest she\r\nshould turn me out of the house, I began talking about indifferent\r\nmatters in order to gain time. Meanwhile Rachel came in to kindle the\r\nfire, which was soon effected by thrusting a red-hot poker between the\r\nbars of the grate, where the fuel was already disposed for ignition.\r\nShe honoured me with another of her hard, inhospitable looks in\r\ndeparting, but, little moved thereby, I went on talking; and setting a\r\nchair for Mrs. Graham on one side of the hearth, and one for myself on\r\nthe other, I ventured to sit down, though half suspecting she would\r\nrather see me go.\r\n\r\nIn a little while we both relapsed into silence, and continued for\r\nseveral minutes gazing abstractedly into the fire\xe2\x80\x94she intent upon her\r\nown sad thoughts, and I reflecting how delightful it would be to be\r\nseated thus beside her with no other presence to restrain our\r\nintercourse\xe2\x80\x94not even that of Arthur, our mutual friend, without whom we\r\nhad never met before\xe2\x80\x94if only I could venture to speak my mind, and\r\ndisburden my full heart of the feelings that had so long oppressed it,\r\nand which it now struggled to retain, with an effort that it seemed\r\nimpossible to continue much longer,\xe2\x80\x94and revolving the pros and cons for\r\nopening my heart to her there and then, and imploring a return of\r\naffection, the permission to regard her thenceforth as my own, and the\r\nright and the power to defend her from the calumnies of malicious\r\ntongues. On the one hand, I felt a new-born confidence in my powers of\r\npersuasion\xe2\x80\x94a strong conviction that my own fervour of spirit would\r\ngrant me eloquence\xe2\x80\x94that my very determination\xe2\x80\x94the absolute necessity\r\nfor succeeding, that I felt must win me what I sought; while, on the\r\nother, I feared to lose the ground I had already gained with so much\r\ntoil and skill, and destroy all future hope by one rash effort, when\r\ntime and patience might have won success. It was like setting my life\r\nupon the cast of a die; and yet I was ready to resolve upon the\r\nattempt. At any rate, I would entreat the explanation she had half\r\npromised to give me before; I would demand the reason of this hateful\r\nbarrier, this mysterious impediment to my happiness, and, as I trusted,\r\nto her own.\r\n\r\nBut while I considered in what manner I could best frame my request, my\r\ncompanion, wakened from her reverie with a scarcely audible sigh, and\r\nlooking towards the window, where the blood-red harvest moon, just\r\nrising over one of the grim, fantastic evergreens, was shining in upon\r\nus, said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert, it is getting late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want me to go, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you ought. If my kind neighbours get to know of this visit\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nno doubt they will\xe2\x80\x94they will not turn it much to my advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nwith what the vicar would doubtless have called a savage sort of smile\r\nthat she said this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them turn it as they will,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are their thoughts to\r\nyou or me, so long as we are satisfied with ourselves\xe2\x80\x94and each other.\r\nLet them go to the deuce with their vile constructions and their lying\r\ninventions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis outburst brought a flush of colour to her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard, then, what they say of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard some detestable falsehoods; but none but fools would credit\r\nthem for a moment, Helen, so don\xe2\x80\x99t let them trouble you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not think Mr. Millward a fool, and he believes it all; but\r\nhowever little you may value the opinions of those about you\xe2\x80\x94however\r\nlittle you may esteem them as individuals, it is not pleasant to be\r\nlooked upon as a liar and a hypocrite, to be thought to practise what\r\nyou abhor, and to encourage the vices you would discountenance, to find\r\nyour good intentions frustrated, and your hands crippled by your\r\nsupposed unworthiness, and to bring disgrace on the principles you\r\nprofess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; and if I, by my thoughtlessness and selfish disregard to\r\nappearances, have at all assisted to expose you to these evils, let me\r\nentreat you not only to pardon me, but to enable me to make reparation;\r\nauthorise me to clear your name from every imputation: give me the\r\nright to identify your honour with my own, and to defend your\r\nreputation as more precious than my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you hero enough to unite yourself to one whom you know to be\r\nsuspected and despised by all around you, and identify your interests\r\nand your honour with hers? Think! it is a serious thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be proud to do it, Helen!\xe2\x80\x94most happy\xe2\x80\x94delighted beyond\r\nexpression!\xe2\x80\x94and if that be all the obstacle to our union, it is\r\ndemolished, and you must\xe2\x80\x94you shall be mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd starting from my seat in a frenzy of ardour, I seized her hand and\r\nwould have pressed it to my lips, but she as suddenly caught it away,\r\nexclaiming in the bitterness of intense affliction,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it is not\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, then? You promised I should know some time, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know some time\xe2\x80\x94but not now\xe2\x80\x94my head aches terribly,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, pressing her hand to her forehead, \xe2\x80\x9cand I must have some\r\nrepose\xe2\x80\x94and surely I have had misery enough to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, almost\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it could not harm you to tell it,\xe2\x80\x9d I persisted: \xe2\x80\x9cit would ease\r\nyour mind; and I should then know how to comfort you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head despondingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew all, you, too, would\r\nblame me\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even more than I deserve\xe2\x80\x94though I have cruelly wronged\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in a low murmur, as if she mused aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_, Helen? Impossible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, not willingly; for I did not know the strength and depth of your\r\nattachment. I thought\xe2\x80\x94at least I endeavoured to think your regard for\r\nme was as cold and fraternal as you professed it to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr as yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr as mine\xe2\x80\x94ought to have been\xe2\x80\x94of such a light and selfish, superficial\r\nnature, that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_There_, indeed, you wronged me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I did; and, sometimes, I suspected it then; but I thought, upon\r\nthe whole, there could be no great harm in leaving your fancies and\r\nyour hopes to dream themselves to nothing\xe2\x80\x94or flutter away to some more\r\nfitting object, while your friendly sympathies remained with me; but if\r\nI had known the depth of your regard, the generous, disinterested\r\naffection you seem to feel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Seem_, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you _do_ feel, then, I would have acted differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? You _could_ not have given me less encouragement, or treated me\r\nwith greater severity than you did! And if you think you have wronged\r\nme by giving me your friendship, and occasionally admitting me to the\r\nenjoyment of your company and conversation, when all hopes of closer\r\nintimacy were vain\xe2\x80\x94as indeed you always gave me to understand\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\nthink you have wronged me by this, you are mistaken; for such favours,\r\nin themselves alone, are not only delightful to my heart, but\r\npurifying, exalting, ennobling to my soul; and I would rather have your\r\nfriendship than the love of any other woman in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle comforted by this, she clasped her hands upon her knee, and\r\nglancing upward, seemed, in silent anguish, to implore divine\r\nassistance; then, turning to me, she calmly said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, if you\r\nmeet me on the moor about mid-day, I will tell you all you seek to\r\nknow; and perhaps you will then see the necessity of discontinuing our\r\nintimacy\xe2\x80\x94if, indeed, you do not willingly resign me as one no longer\r\nworthy of regard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can safely answer no to that: you cannot have such grave confessions\r\nto make\xe2\x80\x94you must be trying my faith, Helen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she earnestly repeated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI wish it were so! Thank heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no great crime to confess; but I have more than you\r\nwill like to hear, or, perhaps, can readily excuse,\xe2\x80\x94and more than I can\r\ntell you now; so let me entreat you to leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will; but answer me this one question first;\xe2\x80\x94do you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not answer it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will conclude you do; and so good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned from me to hide the emotion she could not quite control; but\r\nI took her hand and fervently kissed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert, _do_ leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, in a tone of such thrilling\r\nanguish that I felt it would be cruel to disobey.\r\n\r\nBut I gave one look back before I closed the door, and saw her leaning\r\nforward on the table, with her hands pressed against her eyes, sobbing\r\nconvulsively; yet I withdrew in silence. I felt that to obtrude my\r\nconsolations on her then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings.\r\n\r\nTo tell you all the questionings and conjectures\xe2\x80\x94the fears, and hopes,\r\nand wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as\r\nI descended the hill, would almost fill a volume in itself. But before\r\nI was half-way down, a sentiment of strong sympathy for her I had left\r\nbehind me had displaced all other feelings, and seemed imperatively to\r\ndraw me back: I began to think, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I hurrying so fast in this\r\ndirection? Can I find comfort or consolation\xe2\x80\x94peace, certainty,\r\ncontentment, all\xe2\x80\x94or anything that I want at home? and can I leave all\r\nperturbation, sorrow, and anxiety behind me there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I turned round to look at the old Hall. There was little besides\r\nthe chimneys visible above my contracted horizon. I walked back to get\r\na better view of it. When it rose in sight, I stood still a moment to\r\nlook, and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of\r\nattraction. Something called me nearer\xe2\x80\x94nearer still\xe2\x80\x94and why not, pray?\r\nMight I not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable\r\npile with the full moon in the cloudless heaven shining so calmly above\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to an August night\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nmistress of my soul within, than in returning to my home, where all\r\ncomparatively was light, and life, and cheerfulness, and therefore\r\ninimical to me in my present frame of mind,\xe2\x80\x94and the more so that its\r\ninmates all were more or less imbued with that detestable belief, the\r\nvery _thought_ of which made my blood boil in my veins\xe2\x80\x94and how could I\r\nendure to hear it openly declared, or cautiously insinuated\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\nworse?\xe2\x80\x94I had had trouble enough already, with some babbling fiend that\r\nwould keep whispering in my ear, \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be true,\xe2\x80\x9d till I had shouted\r\naloud, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is false! I defy you to make me suppose it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window. I\r\nwent up to the garden wall, and stood leaning over it, with my eyes\r\nfixed upon the lattice, wondering what she was doing, thinking, or\r\nsuffering now, and wishing I could speak to her but one word, or even\r\ncatch one glimpse of her, before I went.\r\n\r\nI had not thus looked, and wished, and wondered long, before I vaulted\r\nover the barrier, unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance\r\nthrough the window, just to see if she were more composed than when we\r\nparted;\xe2\x80\x94and if I found her still in deep distress, perhaps I might\r\nventure attempt a word of comfort\xe2\x80\x94to utter one of the many things I\r\nshould have said before, instead of aggravating her sufferings by my\r\nstupid impetuosity. I looked. Her chair was vacant: so was the room.\r\nBut at that moment some one opened the outer door, and a voice\xe2\x80\x94_her_\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCome out\xe2\x80\x94I want to see the moon, and breathe the evening\r\nair: they will do me good\xe2\x80\x94if anything will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere, then, were she and Rachel coming to take a walk in the garden. I\r\nwished myself safe back over the wall. I stood, however, in the shadow\r\nof the tall holly-bush, which, standing between the window and the\r\nporch, at present screened me from observation, but did not prevent me\r\nfrom seeing two figures come forth into the moonlight: Mrs. Graham\r\nfollowed by another\xe2\x80\x94_not_ Rachel, but a young man, slender and rather\r\ntall. O heavens, how my temples throbbed! Intense anxiety darkened my\r\nsight; but I thought\xe2\x80\x94yes, and the voice confirmed it\xe2\x80\x94it was Mr.\r\nLawrence!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not let it worry you so much, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI will be\r\nmore cautious in future; and in time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not hear the rest of the sentence; for he walked close beside her\r\nand spoke so gently that I could not catch the words. My heart was\r\nsplitting with hatred; but I listened intently for her reply. I heard\r\nit plainly enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must leave this place, Frederick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI never can be\r\nhappy here,\xe2\x80\x94nor anywhere else, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a mirthless\r\nlaugh,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot rest here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where could you find a better place?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cso secluded\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nnear me, if you think anything of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted she, \xe2\x80\x9cit is all I could wish, if they could only\r\nhave left me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wherever you go, Helen, there will be the same sources of\r\nannoyance. I cannot consent to lose you: I must go with you, or come to\r\nyou; and there are meddling fools elsewhere, as well as here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile thus conversing they had sauntered slowly past me, down the walk,\r\nand I heard no more of their discourse; but I saw him put his arm round\r\nher waist, while she lovingly rested her hand on his shoulder;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen, a tremulous darkness obscured my sight, my heart sickened and my\r\nhead burned like fire: I half rushed, half staggered from the spot,\r\nwhere horror had kept me rooted, and leaped or tumbled over the wall\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhardly know which\xe2\x80\x94but I know that, afterwards, like a passionate child,\r\nI dashed myself on the ground and lay there in a paroxysm of anger and\r\ndespair\xe2\x80\x94how long, I cannot undertake to say; but it must have been a\r\nconsiderable time; for when, having partially relieved myself by a\r\ntorment of tears, and looked up at the moon, shining so calmly and\r\ncarelessly on, as little influenced by my misery as I was by its\r\npeaceful radiance, and earnestly prayed for death or forgetfulness, I\r\nhad risen and journeyed homewards\xe2\x80\x94little regarding the way, but carried\r\ninstinctively by my feet to the door, I found it bolted against me, and\r\nevery one in bed except my mother, who hastened to answer my impatient\r\nknocking, and received me with a shower of questions and rebukes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gilbert! how _could_ you do so? Where _have_ you been? Do come in\r\nand take your supper. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it all ready, though you don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve\r\nit, for keeping me in such a fright, after the strange manner you left\r\nthe house this evening. Mr. Millward was quite\xe2\x80\x94Bless the boy! how ill\r\nhe looks. Oh, gracious! what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing\xe2\x80\x94give me a candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t you take some supper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I want to go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, taking a candle and lighting it at\r\nthe one she held in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gilbert, how you tremble!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my anxious parent. \xe2\x80\x9cHow white\r\nyou look! Do tell me what it is? Has anything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, ready to stamp with vexation because the\r\ncandle would not light. Then, suppressing my irritation, I added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen walking too fast, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Good-night,\xe2\x80\x9d and marched off to bed,\r\nregardless of the \xe2\x80\x9cWalking too fast! where have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d that was\r\ncalled after me from below.\r\n\r\nMy mother followed me to the very door of my room with her questionings\r\nand advice concerning my health and my conduct; but I implored her to\r\nlet me alone till morning; and she withdrew, and at length I had the\r\nsatisfaction to hear her close her own door. There was no sleep for me,\r\nhowever, that night as I thought; and instead of attempting to solicit\r\nit, I employed myself in rapidly pacing the chamber, having first\r\nremoved my boots, lest my mother should hear me. But the boards\r\ncreaked, and she was watchful. I had not walked above a quarter of an\r\nhour before she was at the door again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert, why are you not in bed\xe2\x80\x94you said you wanted to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it! I\xe2\x80\x99m going,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you so long about it? You must have something on your\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let me alone, and get to bed yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be that Mrs. Graham that distresses you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I tell you\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to goodness it mayn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, with a sigh, as she\r\nreturned to her own apartment, while I threw myself on the bed, feeling\r\nmost undutifully disaffected towards her for having deprived me of what\r\nseemed the only shadow of a consolation that remained, and chained me\r\nto that wretched couch of thorns.\r\n\r\nNever did I endure so long, so miserable a night as that. And yet it\r\nwas not wholly sleepless. Towards morning my distracting thoughts began\r\nto lose all pretensions to coherency, and shape themselves into\r\nconfused and feverish dreams, and, at length, there followed an\r\ninterval of unconscious slumber. But then the dawn of bitter\r\nrecollection that succeeded\xe2\x80\x94the waking to find life a blank, and worse\r\nthan a blank, teeming with torment and misery\xe2\x80\x94not a mere barren\r\nwilderness, but full of thorns and briers\xe2\x80\x94to find myself deceived,\r\nduped, hopeless, my affections trampled upon, my angel not an angel,\r\nand my friend a fiend incarnate\xe2\x80\x94it was worse than if I had not slept at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, gloomy morning; the weather had changed like my\r\nprospects, and the rain was pattering against the window. I rose,\r\nnevertheless, and went out; not to look after the farm, though that\r\nwould serve as my excuse, but to cool my brain, and regain, if\r\npossible, a sufficient degree of composure to meet the family at the\r\nmorning meal without exciting inconvenient remarks. If I got a wetting,\r\nthat, in conjunction with a pretended over-exertion before breakfast,\r\nmight excuse my sudden loss of appetite; and if a cold ensued, the\r\nseverer the better\xe2\x80\x94it would help to account for the sullen moods and\r\nmoping melancholy likely to cloud my brow for long enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Gilbert, I wish you _would_ try to be a little more amiable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid my mother one morning after some display of unjustifiable\r\nill-humour on my part. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say there is nothing the matter with you,\r\nand nothing has happened to grieve you, and yet I never _saw_ anyone so\r\naltered as you within these last few days. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t a good word for\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x94friends and strangers, equals and inferiors\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same.\r\nI do wish you\xe2\x80\x99d try to check it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheck what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, your strange temper. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know _how_ it spoils you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\na finer disposition than yours by nature could not be, if you\xe2\x80\x99d let it\r\nhave fair play: so you\xe2\x80\x99ve no excuse _that_ way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she thus remonstrated, I took up a book, and laying it open on\r\nthe table before me, pretended to be deeply absorbed in its perusal,\r\nfor I was equally unable to justify myself and unwilling to acknowledge\r\nmy errors; and I wished to have nothing to say on the matter. But my\r\nexcellent parent went on lecturing, and then came to coaxing, and began\r\nto stroke my hair; and I was getting to feel quite a good boy, but my\r\nmischievous brother, who was idling about the room, revived my\r\ncorruption by suddenly calling out,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch him, mother! he\xe2\x80\x99ll bite! He\xe2\x80\x99s a very tiger in human form.\r\n_I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ given him up for my part\xe2\x80\x94fairly disowned him\xe2\x80\x94cast him off, root\r\nand branch. It\xe2\x80\x99s as much as my life is worth to come within six yards\r\nof him. The other day he nearly fractured my skull for singing a\r\npretty, inoffensive love-song, on purpose to amuse him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gilbert! how could you?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you to hold your noise first, you know, Fergus,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but when I assured you it was no trouble and went on with the\r\nnext verse, thinking you might like it better, you clutched me by the\r\nshoulder and dashed me away, right against the wall there, with such\r\nforce that I thought I had bitten my tongue in two, and expected to see\r\nthe place plastered with my brains; and when I put my hand to my head,\r\nand found my skull not broken, I thought it was a miracle, and no\r\nmistake. But, poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d added he, with a sentimental sigh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chis\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s broken\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth of it\xe2\x80\x94and his head\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be silent NOW?\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, starting up, and eyeing the fellow\r\nso fiercely that my mother, thinking I meant to inflict some grievous\r\nbodily injury, laid her hand on my arm, and besought me to let him\r\nalone, and he walked leisurely out, with his hands in his pockets,\r\nsinging provokingly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShall I, because a woman\xe2\x80\x99s fair,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to defile my fingers with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in answer to the\r\nmaternal intercession. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch him with the tongs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI now recollected that I had business with Robert Wilson, concerning\r\nthe purchase of a certain field adjoining my farm\xe2\x80\x94a business I had been\r\nputting off from day to day; for I had no interest in anything now; and\r\nbesides, I was misanthropically inclined, and, moreover, had a\r\nparticular objection to meeting Jane Wilson or her mother; for though I\r\nhad too good reason, now, to credit their reports concerning Mrs.\r\nGraham, I did not _like_ them a bit the better for it\xe2\x80\x94or Eliza Millward\r\neither\xe2\x80\x94and the thought of meeting them was the more repugnant to me\r\nthat I could not, now, defy their seeming calumnies and triumph in my\r\nown convictions as before. But to-day I determined to make an effort to\r\nreturn to my duty. Though I found no pleasure in it, it would be less\r\nirksome than idleness\xe2\x80\x94at all events it would be more profitable. If\r\nlife promised no enjoyment within my vocation, at least it offered no\r\nallurements out of it; and henceforth I would put my shoulder to the\r\nwheel and toil away, like any poor drudge of a cart-horse that was\r\nfairly broken in to its labour, and plod through life, not wholly\r\nuseless if not agreeable, and uncomplaining if not contented with my\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nThus resolving, with a kind of sullen resignation, if such a term may\r\nbe allowed, I wended my way to Ryecote Farm, scarcely expecting to find\r\nits owner within at this time of day, but hoping to learn in what part\r\nof the premises he was most likely to be found.\r\n\r\nAbsent he was, but expected home in a few minutes; and I was desired to\r\nstep into the parlour and wait. Mrs. Wilson was busy in the kitchen,\r\nbut the room was not empty; and I scarcely checked an involuntary\r\nrecoil as I entered it; for there sat Miss Wilson chattering with Eliza\r\nMillward. However, I determined to be cool and civil. Eliza seemed to\r\nhave made the same resolution on her part. We had not met since the\r\nevening of the tea-party; but there was no visible emotion either of\r\npleasure or pain, no attempt at pathos, no display of injured pride:\r\nshe was cool in temper, civil in demeanour. There was even an ease and\r\ncheerfulness about her air and manner that I made no pretension to; but\r\nthere was a depth of malice in her too expressive eye that plainly told\r\nme I was not forgiven; for, though she no longer hoped to win me to\r\nherself, she still hated her rival, and evidently delighted to wreak\r\nher spite on me. On the other hand, Miss Wilson was as affable and\r\ncourteous as heart could wish, and though I was in no very conversable\r\nhumour myself, the two ladies between them managed to keep up a pretty\r\ncontinuous fire of small talk. But Eliza took advantage of the first\r\nconvenient pause to ask if I had lately seen Mrs. Graham, in a tone of\r\nmerely casual inquiry, but with a sidelong glance\xe2\x80\x94intended to be\r\nplayfully mischievous\xe2\x80\x94really, brimful and running over with malice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot lately,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, in a careless tone, but sternly repelling her\r\nodious glances with my eyes; for I was vexed to feel the colour\r\nmounting to my forehead, despite my strenuous efforts to appear\r\nunmoved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! are you beginning to tire already? I thought so noble a creature\r\nwould have power to attach you for a year at least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not speak of her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! then you are convinced, at last, of your mistake\xe2\x80\x94you have at\r\nlength discovered that your divinity is not quite the immaculate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desired you not to speak of her, Miss Eliza.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon! I perceive Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s arrows have been too sharp\r\nfor you: the wounds, being more than skin-deep, are not yet healed, and\r\nbleed afresh at every mention of the loved one\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Miss Wilson, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Markham feels that\r\nname is unworthy to be mentioned in the presence of right-minded\r\nfemales. I wonder, Eliza, you should think of referring to that\r\nunfortunate person\xe2\x80\x94you might know the mention of her would be anything\r\nbut agreeable to any one here present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow could this be borne? I rose and was about to clap my hat upon my\r\nhead and burst away, in wrathful indignation from the house; but\r\nrecollecting\xe2\x80\x94just in time to save my dignity\xe2\x80\x94the folly of such a\r\nproceeding, and how it would only give my fair tormentors a merry laugh\r\nat my expense, for the sake of one I acknowledged in my own heart to be\r\nunworthy of the slightest sacrifice\xe2\x80\x94though the ghost of my former\r\nreverence and love so hung about me still, that I could not bear to\r\nhear her name aspersed by others\xe2\x80\x94I merely walked to the window, and\r\nhaving spent a few seconds in vengibly biting my lips and sternly\r\nrepressing the passionate heavings of my chest, I observed to Miss\r\nWilson, that I could see nothing of her brother, and added that, as my\r\ntime was precious, it would perhaps be better to call again to-morrow,\r\nat some time when I should be sure to find him at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cif you wait a minute, he will be sure to come; for\r\nhe has business at L\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (that was our market-town), \xe2\x80\x9cand will require a\r\nlittle refreshment before he goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI submitted accordingly, with the best grace I could; and, happily, I\r\nhad not long to wait. Mr. Wilson soon arrived, and, indisposed for\r\nbusiness as I was at that moment, and little as I cared for the field\r\nor its owner, I forced my attention to the matter in hand, with very\r\ncreditable determination, and quickly concluded the bargain\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\nmore to the thrifty farmer\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction than he cared to acknowledge.\r\nThen, leaving him to the discussion of his substantial \xe2\x80\x9crefreshment,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ngladly quitted the house, and went to look after my reapers.\r\n\r\nLeaving them busy at work on the side of the valley, I ascended the\r\nhill, intending to visit a corn-field in the more elevated regions, and\r\nsee when it would be ripe for the sickle. But I did _not_ visit it that\r\nday; for, as I approached, I beheld, at no great distance, Mrs. Graham\r\nand her son coming down in the opposite direction. They saw me; and\r\nArthur already was running to meet me; but I immediately turned back\r\nand walked steadily homeward; for I had fully determined never to\r\nencounter his mother again; and regardless of the shrill voice in my\r\near, calling upon me to \xe2\x80\x9cwait a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d I pursued the even tenor of my\r\nway; and he soon relinquished the pursuit as hopeless, or was called\r\naway by his mother. At all events, when I looked back, five minutes\r\nafter, not a trace of either was to be seen.\r\n\r\nThis incident agitated and disturbed me most unaccountably\xe2\x80\x94unless you\r\nwould account for it by saying that Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s arrows not only had been\r\ntoo sharp for me, but they were barbed and deeply rooted, and I had not\r\nyet been able to wrench them from my heart. However that be, I was\r\nrendered doubly miserable for the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, I bethought me, I, too, had business at L\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94; so I mounted\r\nmy horse, and set forth on the expedition soon after breakfast. It was\r\na dull, drizzly day; but that was no matter: it was all the more\r\nsuitable to my frame of mind. It was likely to be a lonely journey; for\r\nit was no market-day, and the road I traversed was little frequented at\r\nany other time; but that suited me all the better too.\r\n\r\nAs I trotted along, however, chewing the cud of\xe2\x80\x94_bitter_ fancies, I\r\nheard another horse at no great distance behind me; but I never\r\nconjectured who the rider might be, or troubled my head about him,\r\ntill, on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle acclivity, or rather,\r\nsuffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk\xe2\x80\x94for, rapt in my\r\nown reflections, I was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought\r\nproper\xe2\x80\x94I lost ground, and my fellow-traveller overtook me. He accosted\r\nme by name, for it was no stranger\xe2\x80\x94it was Mr. Lawrence! Instinctively\r\nthe fingers of my whip-hand tingled, and grasped their charge with\r\nconvulsive energy; but I restrained the impulse, and answering his\r\nsalutation with a nod, attempted to push on; but he pushed on beside\r\nme, and began to talk about the weather and the crops. I gave the\r\nbriefest possible answers to his queries and observations, and fell\r\nback. He fell back too, and asked if my horse was lame. I replied with\r\na _look_, at which he placidly smiled.\r\n\r\nI was as much astonished as exasperated at this singular pertinacity\r\nand imperturbable assurance on his part. I had thought the\r\ncircumstances of our last meeting would have left such an impression on\r\nhis mind as to render him cold and distant ever after: instead of that,\r\nhe appeared not only to have forgotten all former offences, but to be\r\nimpenetrable to all present incivilities. Formerly, the slightest hint,\r\nor mere fancied coldness in tone or glance, had sufficed to repulse\r\nhim: now, positive rudeness could not drive him away. Had he heard of\r\nmy disappointment; and was he come to witness the result, and triumph\r\nin my despair? I grasped my whip with more determined energy than\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94but still forbore to raise it, and rode on in silence, waiting\r\nfor some more tangible cause of offence, before I opened the floodgates\r\nof my soul and poured out the dammed-up fury that was foaming and\r\nswelling within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarkham,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in his usual quiet tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you quarrel with\r\nyour friends, because you have been disappointed in one quarter? You\r\nhave found your hopes defeated; but how am _I_ to blame for it? I\r\nwarned you beforehand, you know, but you would not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said no more; for, impelled by some fiend at my elbow, I had seized\r\nmy whip by the small end, and\xe2\x80\x94swift and sudden as a flash of\r\nlightning\xe2\x80\x94brought the other down upon his head. It was not without a\r\nfeeling of savage satisfaction that I beheld the instant, deadly pallor\r\nthat overspread his face, and the few red drops that trickled down his\r\nforehead, while he reeled a moment in his saddle, and then fell\r\nbackward to the ground. The pony, surprised to be so strangely relieved\r\nof its burden, started and capered, and kicked a little, and then made\r\nuse of its freedom to go and crop the grass of the hedge-bank: while\r\nits master lay as still and silent as a corpse. Had I killed him?\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nicy hand seemed to grasp my heart and check its pulsation, as I bent\r\nover him, gazing with breathless intensity upon the ghastly, upturned\r\nface. But no; he moved his eyelids and uttered a slight groan. I\r\nbreathed again\xe2\x80\x94he was only stunned by the fall. It served him right\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould teach him better manners in future. Should I help him to his\r\nhorse? No. For any other combination of offences I would; but his were\r\ntoo unpardonable. He might mount it himself, if he liked\xe2\x80\x94in a while:\r\nalready he was beginning to stir and look about him\xe2\x80\x94and there it was\r\nfor him, quietly browsing on the road-side.\r\n\r\nSo with a muttered execration I left the fellow to his fate, and\r\nclapping spurs to my own horse, galloped away, excited by a combination\r\nof feelings it would not be easy to analyse; and perhaps, if I did so,\r\nthe result would not be very creditable to my disposition; for I am not\r\nsure that a species of exultation in what I had done was not one\r\nprincipal concomitant.\r\n\r\nShortly, however, the effervescence began to abate, and not many\r\nminutes elapsed before I had turned and gone back to look after the\r\nfate of my victim. It was no generous impulse\xe2\x80\x94no kind relentings that\r\nled me to this\xe2\x80\x94nor even the fear of what might be the consequences to\r\nmyself, if I finished my assault upon the squire by leaving him thus\r\nneglected, and exposed to further injury; it was, simply, the voice of\r\nconscience; and I took great credit to myself for attending so promptly\r\nto its dictates\xe2\x80\x94and judging the merit of the deed by the sacrifice it\r\ncost, I was not far wrong.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence and his pony had both altered their positions in some\r\ndegree. The pony had wandered eight or ten yards further away; and he\r\nhad managed, somehow, to remove himself from the middle of the road: I\r\nfound him seated in a recumbent position on the bank,\xe2\x80\x94looking very\r\nwhite and sickly still, and holding his cambric handkerchief (now more\r\nred than white) to his head. It must have been a powerful blow; but\r\nhalf the credit\xe2\x80\x94or the blame of it (which you please) must be\r\nattributed to the whip, which was garnished with a massive horse\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nof plated metal. The grass, being sodden with rain, afforded the young\r\ngentleman a rather inhospitable couch; his clothes were considerably\r\nbemired; and his hat was rolling in the mud on the other side of the\r\nroad. But his thoughts seemed chiefly bent upon his pony, on which he\r\nwas wistfully gazing\xe2\x80\x94half in helpless anxiety, and half in hopeless\r\nabandonment to his fate.\r\n\r\nI dismounted, however, and having fastened my own animal to the nearest\r\ntree, first picked up his hat, intending to clap it on his head; but\r\neither he considered his head unfit for a hat, or the hat, in its\r\npresent condition, unfit for his head; for shrinking away the one, he\r\ntook the other from my hand, and scornfully cast it aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered.\r\n\r\nMy next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him, which\r\nwas soon accomplished; for the beast was quiet enough in the main, and\r\nonly winced and flirted a trifle till I got hold of the bridle\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthen, I must see him in the saddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you fellow\xe2\x80\x94scoundrel\xe2\x80\x94dog\xe2\x80\x94give me your hand, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you to\r\nmount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo; he turned from me in disgust. I attempted to take him by the arm.\r\nHe shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you won\xe2\x80\x99t! Well! you may sit there till doomsday, for what I\r\ncare. But I suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose all the blood in your\r\nbody\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll just condescend to bind that up for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph; with all my heart. You may go to the d\xe2\x80\x94l, if you choose\xe2\x80\x94and say\r\nI sent you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut before I abandoned him to his fate I flung his pony\xe2\x80\x99s bridle over a\r\nstake in the hedge, and threw him my handkerchief, as his own was now\r\nsaturated with blood. He took it and cast it back to me in abhorrence\r\nand contempt, with all the strength he could muster. It wanted but this\r\nto fill the measure of his offences. With execrations not loud but deep\r\nI left him to live or die as he could, well satisfied that I had done\r\n_my_ duty in attempting to save him\xe2\x80\x94but forgetting how I had erred in\r\nbringing him into such a condition, and how insultingly my\r\nafter-services had been offered\xe2\x80\x94and sullenly prepared to meet the\r\nconsequences if he should choose to say I had attempted to murder\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94which I thought not unlikely, as it seemed probable he was actuated\r\nby such spiteful motives in so perseveringly refusing my assistance.\r\n\r\nHaving remounted my horse, I just looked back to see how he was getting\r\non, before I rode away. He had risen from the ground, and grasping his\r\npony\xe2\x80\x99s mane, was attempting to resume his seat in the saddle; but\r\nscarcely had he put his foot in the stirrup, when a sickness or\r\ndizziness seemed to overpower him: he leant forward a moment, with his\r\nhead drooped on the animal\xe2\x80\x99s back, and then made one more effort, which\r\nproving ineffectual, he sank back on the bank, where I left him,\r\nreposing his head on the oozy turf, and to all appearance, as calmly\r\nreclining as if he had been taking his rest on his sofa at home.\r\n\r\nI ought to have helped him in spite of himself\xe2\x80\x94to have bound up the\r\nwound he was unable to staunch, and insisted upon getting him on his\r\nhorse and seeing him safe home; but, besides my bitter indignation\r\nagainst himself, there was the question what to say to his servants\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhat to my own family. Either I should have to acknowledge the deed,\r\nwhich would set me down as a madman, unless I acknowledged the motive\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94and that seemed impossible\xe2\x80\x94or I must get up a lie, which seemed\r\nequally out of the question\xe2\x80\x94especially as Mr. Lawrence would probably\r\nreveal the whole truth, and thereby bring me to tenfold disgrace\xe2\x80\x94unless\r\nI were villain enough, presuming on the absence of witnesses, to\r\npersist in my own version of the case, and make him out a still greater\r\nscoundrel than he was. No; he had only received a cut above the temple,\r\nand perhaps a few bruises from the fall, or the hoofs of his own pony:\r\nthat could not kill him if he lay there half the day; and, if he could\r\nnot help himself, surely some one would be coming by: it would be\r\nimpossible that a whole day should pass and no one traverse the road\r\nbut ourselves. As for what he might choose to say hereafter, I would\r\ntake my chance about it: if he told lies, I would contradict him; if he\r\ntold the truth, I would bear it as best I could. I was not _obliged_ to\r\nenter into explanations further than I thought proper. Perhaps he might\r\nchoose to be silent on the subject, for fear of raising inquiries as to\r\nthe cause of the quarrel, and drawing the public attention to his\r\nconnection with Mrs. Graham, which, whether for her sake or his own, he\r\nseemed so very desirous to conceal.\r\n\r\nThus reasoning, I trotted away to the town, where I duly transacted my\r\nbusiness, and performed various little commissions for my mother and\r\nRose, with very laudable exactitude, considering the different\r\ncircumstances of the case. In returning home, I was troubled with\r\nsundry misgivings about the unfortunate Lawrence. The question, What if\r\nI should find him lying still on the damp earth, fairly dying of cold\r\nand exhaustion\xe2\x80\x94or already stark and chill? thrust itself most\r\nunpleasantly upon my mind, and the appalling possibility pictured\r\nitself with painful vividness to my imagination as I approached the\r\nspot where I had left him. But no, thank heaven, both man and horse\r\nwere gone, and nothing was left to witness against me but two\r\nobjects\xe2\x80\x94unpleasant enough in themselves to be sure, and presenting a\r\nvery ugly, not to say murderous appearance\xe2\x80\x94in one place, the hat\r\nsaturated with rain and coated with mud, indented and broken above the\r\nbrim by that villainous whip-handle; in another, the crimson\r\nhandkerchief, soaking in a deeply tinctured pool of water\xe2\x80\x94for much rain\r\nhad fallen in the interim.\r\n\r\nBad news flies fast: it was hardly four o\xe2\x80\x99clock when I got home, but my\r\nmother gravely accosted me with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gilbert!\xe2\x80\x94_Such_ an accident! Rose\r\nhas been shopping in the village, and she\xe2\x80\x99s heard that Mr. Lawrence has\r\nbeen thrown from his horse and brought home dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis shocked me a trifle, as you may suppose; but I was comforted to\r\nhear that he had frightfully fractured his skull and broken a leg; for,\r\nassured of the falsehood of this, I trusted the rest of the story was\r\nequally exaggerated; and when I heard my mother and sister so feelingly\r\ndeploring his condition, I had considerable difficulty in preventing\r\nmyself from telling them the real extent of the injuries, as far as I\r\nknew them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go and see him to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Rose: \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time; and you can have\r\nthe pony, as your horse is tired. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Gilbert\xe2\x80\x94as soon as you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad something to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94how can we tell that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t all a false report? It\xe2\x80\x99s highly\r\nim-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it isn\xe2\x80\x99t; for the village is all alive about it; and I\r\nsaw two people that had seen others that had seen the man that found\r\nhim. That sounds far-fetched; but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so when you think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but Lawrence is a good rider; it is not likely he would fall\r\nfrom his horse at all; and if he did, it is highly improbable he would\r\nbreak his bones in that way. It must be a gross exaggeration at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but the horse kicked him\xe2\x80\x94or something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, his quiet little pony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know it was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seldom rides any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will call to-morrow. Whether it be\r\ntrue or false, exaggerated or otherwise, we shall like to know how he\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFergus may go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has more time. I am busy just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but, Gilbert, how can you be so composed about it? You won\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nbusiness for an hour or two in a case of this sort, when your friend is\r\nat the point of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is _not_, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor anything you know, he _may_ be: you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell till you have seen\r\nhim. At all events, he must have met with some terrible accident, and\r\nyou ought to see him: he\xe2\x80\x99ll take it very unkind if you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it! I can\xe2\x80\x99t. He and I have not been on good terms of late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my _dear_ boy! Surely, surely you are not so unforgiving as to\r\ncarry your little differences to such a length as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle differences, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but only remember the occasion. Think how\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me now\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll see about it,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\nAnd my seeing about it was to send Fergus next morning, with my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, to make the requisite inquiries; for, of course,\r\nmy going was out of the question\xe2\x80\x94or sending a message either. He\r\nbrought back intelligence that the young squire was laid up with the\r\ncomplicated evils of a broken head and certain contusions (occasioned\r\nby a fall\xe2\x80\x94of which he did not trouble himself to relate the\r\nparticulars\xe2\x80\x94and the subsequent misconduct of his horse), and a severe\r\ncold, the consequence of lying on the wet ground in the rain; but there\r\nwere no broken bones, and no immediate prospects of dissolution.\r\n\r\nIt was evident, then, that for Mrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s sake it was not his\r\nintention to criminate me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day was rainy like its predecessor; but towards evening it began\r\nto clear up a little, and the next morning was fair and promising. I\r\nwas out on the hill with the reapers. A light wind swept over the corn,\r\nand all nature laughed in the sunshine. The lark was rejoicing among\r\nthe silvery floating clouds. The late rain had so sweetly freshened and\r\ncleared the air, and washed the sky, and left such glittering gems on\r\nbranch and blade, that not even the farmers could have the heart to\r\nblame it. But no ray of sunshine could reach my heart, no breeze could\r\nfreshen it; nothing could fill the void my faith, and hope, and joy in\r\nHelen Graham had left, or drive away the keen regrets and bitter dregs\r\nof lingering love that still oppressed it.\r\n\r\nWhile I stood with folded arms abstractedly gazing on the undulating\r\nswell of the corn, not yet disturbed by the reapers, something gently\r\npulled my skirts, and a small voice, no longer welcome to my ears,\r\naroused me with the startling words,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Markham, mamma wants you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants _me_, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Why do you look so queer?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, half laughing, half\r\nfrightened at the unexpected aspect of my face in suddenly turning\r\ntowards him,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand why have you kept so long away? Come! Won\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m busy just now,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, scarce knowing what to answer.\r\n\r\nHe looked up in childish bewilderment; but before I could speak again\r\nthe lady herself was at my side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert, I _must_ speak with you!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a tone of suppressed\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\nI looked at her pale cheek and glittering eye, but answered nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded she. \xe2\x80\x9cJust step aside into this other\r\nfield.\xe2\x80\x9d She glanced at the reapers, some of whom were directing looks\r\nof impertinent curiosity towards her. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t keep you a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI accompanied her through the gap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArthur, darling, run and gather those bluebells,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, pointing\r\nto some that were gleaming at some distance under the hedge along which\r\nwe walked. The child hesitated, as if unwilling to quit my side. \xe2\x80\x9cGo,\r\nlove!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated she more urgently, and in a tone which, though not\r\nunkind, demanded prompt obedience, and obtained it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Graham?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, calmly and coldly; for, though I saw she\r\nwas miserable, and pitied her, I felt glad to have it in my power to\r\ntorment her.\r\n\r\nShe fixed her eyes upon me with a look that pierced me to the heart;\r\nand yet it made me smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask the reason of this change, Gilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with bitter\r\ncalmness: \xe2\x80\x9cI know it too well; but though I could see myself suspected\r\nand condemned by every one else, and bear it with calmness, I cannot\r\nendure it from you.\xe2\x80\x94Why did you not come to hear my explanation on the\r\nday I appointed to give it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I happened, in the interim, to learn all you would have told\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94and a trifle more, I imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, for I would have told you all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she,\r\npassionately\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t now, for I see you are not worthy of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd her pale lips quivered with agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe repelled my mocking smile with a glance of scornful indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you never understood me, or you would not soon have listened\r\nto my traducers\xe2\x80\x94my confidence would be misplaced in you\xe2\x80\x94you are not the\r\nman I thought you. Go! I won\xe2\x80\x99t care _what_ you think of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away, and I went; for I thought that would torment her as\r\nmuch as anything; and I believe I was right; for, looking back a minute\r\nafter, I saw her turn half round, as if hoping or expecting to find me\r\nstill beside her; and then she stood still, and cast one look behind.\r\nIt was a look less expressive of anger than of bitter anguish and\r\ndespair; but I immediately assumed an aspect of indifference, and\r\naffected to be gazing carelessly around me, and I suppose she went on;\r\nfor after lingering awhile to see if she would come back or call, I\r\nventured one more glance, and saw her a good way off, moving rapidly up\r\nthe field, with little Arthur running by her side and apparently\r\ntalking as he went; but she kept her face averted from him, as if to\r\nhide some uncontrollable emotion. And I returned to my business.\r\n\r\nBut I soon began to regret my precipitancy in leaving her so soon. It\r\nwas evident she loved me\xe2\x80\x94probably she was tired of Mr. Lawrence, and\r\nwished to exchange him for me; and if I had loved and reverenced her\r\nless to begin with, the preference might have gratified and amused me;\r\nbut now the contrast between her outward seeming and her inward mind,\r\nas I supposed,\xe2\x80\x94between my former and my present opinion of her, was so\r\nharrowing\xe2\x80\x94so distressing to my feelings, that it swallowed up every\r\nlighter consideration.\r\n\r\nBut still I was curious to know what sort of an explanation she would\r\nhave given me\xe2\x80\x94or would give now, if I pressed her for it\xe2\x80\x94how much she\r\nwould confess, and how she would endeavour to excuse herself. I longed\r\nto know what to despise, and what to admire in her; how much to pity,\r\nand how much to hate;\xe2\x80\x94and, what was more, I _would_ know. I would see\r\nher once more, and fairly satisfy myself in what light to regard her,\r\nbefore we parted. Lost to me she was, for ever, of course; but still I\r\ncould not bear to think that we had parted, for the last time, with so\r\nmuch unkindness and misery on both sides. That last look of hers had\r\nsunk into my heart; I could not forget it. But what a fool I was! Had\r\nshe not deceived me, injured me\xe2\x80\x94blighted my happiness for life? \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll see her, however,\xe2\x80\x9d was my concluding resolve, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not to-day:\r\nto-day and to-night she may think upon her sins, and be as miserable as\r\nshe will: to-morrow I will see her once again, and know something more\r\nabout her. The interview may be serviceable to her, or it may not. At\r\nany rate, it will give a breath of excitement to the life she has\r\ndoomed to stagnation, and may calm with certainty some agitating\r\nthoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did go on the morrow, but not till towards evening, after the\r\nbusiness of the day was concluded, that is, between six and seven; and\r\nthe westering sun was gleaming redly on the old Hall, and flaming in\r\nthe latticed windows, as I reached it, imparting to the place a\r\ncheerfulness not its own. I need not dilate upon the feelings with\r\nwhich I approached the shrine of my former divinity\xe2\x80\x94that spot teeming\r\nwith a thousand delightful recollections and glorious dreams\xe2\x80\x94all\r\ndarkened now by one disastrous truth.\r\n\r\nRachel admitted me into the parlour, and went to call her mistress, for\r\nshe was not there: but there was her desk left open on the little round\r\ntable beside the high-backed chair, with a book laid upon it. Her\r\nlimited but choice collection of books was almost as familiar to me as\r\nmy own; but this volume I had not seen before. I took it up. It was Sir\r\nHumphry Davy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLast Days of a Philosopher,\xe2\x80\x9d and on the first leaf was\r\nwritten, \xe2\x80\x9cFrederick Lawrence.\xe2\x80\x9d I closed the book, but kept it in my\r\nhand, and stood facing the door, with my back to the fire-place, calmly\r\nwaiting her arrival; for I did not doubt she would come. And soon I\r\nheard her step in the hall. My heart was beginning to throb, but I\r\nchecked it with an internal rebuke, and maintained my\r\ncomposure\xe2\x80\x94outwardly at least. She entered, calm, pale, collected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what am I indebted for this favour, Mr. Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with\r\nsuch severe but quiet dignity as almost disconcerted me; but I answered\r\nwith a smile, and impudently enough,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am come to hear your explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you I would not give it,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI said you were unworthy\r\nof my confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, moving to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last time I shall see you:\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t go just yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI remained, awaiting her further commands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed she, \xe2\x80\x9con what grounds you believe these things\r\nagainst me; who told you; and what did they say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI paused a moment. She met my eye as unflinchingly as if her bosom had\r\nbeen steeled with conscious innocence. She was resolved to know the\r\nworst, and determined to dare it too. \xe2\x80\x9cI can crush that bold spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought I. But while I secretly exulted in my power, I felt disposed to\r\ndally with my victim like a cat. Showing her the book that I still\r\nheld, in my hand, and pointing to the name on the fly-leaf, but fixing\r\nmy eye upon her face, I asked,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she; and a sudden flush suffused her\r\nfeatures\xe2\x80\x94whether of shame or anger I could not tell: it rather\r\nresembled the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat next, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it since you saw him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you the right to catechize me on this or any other subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no one!\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s quite at your option whether to answer or not. And\r\nnow, let me ask\xe2\x80\x94have you heard what has lately befallen this friend of\r\nyours?\xe2\x80\x94because, if you have not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be insulted, Mr. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, almost infuriated at\r\nmy manner. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you had better leave the house at once, if you came only\r\nfor that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not come to insult you: I came to hear your explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you I won\xe2\x80\x99t give it!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted she, pacing the room in a\r\nstate of strong excitement, with her hands clasped tightly together,\r\nbreathing short, and flashing fires of indignation from her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill not condescend to explain myself to one that can make a jest of\r\nsuch horrible suspicions, and be so easily led to entertain them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not make a jest of them, Mrs. Graham,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I, dropping at\r\nonce my tone of taunting sarcasm. \xe2\x80\x9cI heartily wish I could find them a\r\njesting matter. And as to being easily led to suspect, God only knows\r\nwhat a blind, incredulous fool I have hitherto been, perseveringly\r\nshutting my eyes and stopping my ears against everything that\r\nthreatened to shake my confidence in you, till proof itself confounded\r\nmy infatuation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proof, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. You remember that evening when I was here last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven then you dropped some hints that might have opened the eyes of a\r\nwiser man; but they had no such effect upon me: I went on trusting and\r\nbelieving, hoping against hope, and adoring where I could not\r\ncomprehend. It so happened, however, that after I left you I turned\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94drawn by pure depth of sympathy and ardour of affection\xe2\x80\x94not daring\r\nto intrude my presence openly upon you, but unable to resist the\r\ntemptation of catching one glimpse through the window, just to see how\r\nyou were: for I had left you apparently in great affliction, and I\r\npartly blamed my own want of forbearance and discretion as the cause of\r\nit. If I did wrong, love alone was my incentive, and the punishment was\r\nsevere enough; for it was just as I had reached that tree, that you\r\ncame out into the garden with your friend. Not choosing to show myself,\r\nunder the circumstances, I stood still, in the shadow, till you had\r\nboth passed by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much of our conversation did you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard quite enough, Helen. And it was well for me that I did hear\r\nit; for nothing less could have cured my infatuation. I always said and\r\nthought, that I would never believe a word against you, unless I heard\r\nit from your own lips. All the hints and affirmations of others I\r\ntreated as malignant, baseless slanders; your own self-accusations I\r\nbelieved to be overstrained; and all that seemed unaccountable in your\r\nposition I trusted that you could account for if you chose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Graham had discontinued her walk. She leant against one end of the\r\nchimney-piece, opposite that near which I was standing, with her chin\r\nresting on her closed hand, her eyes\xe2\x80\x94no longer burning with anger, but\r\ngleaming with restless excitement\xe2\x80\x94sometimes glancing at me while I\r\nspoke, then coursing the opposite wall, or fixed upon the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have come to me after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand heard what I had\r\nto say in my own justification. It was ungenerous and wrong to withdraw\r\nyourself so secretly and suddenly, immediately after such ardent\r\nprotestations of attachment, without ever assigning a reason for the\r\nchange. You should have told me all\xe2\x80\x94no matter _how_ bitterly. It would\r\nhave been better than this silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what end should I have done so? You could not have enlightened me\r\nfurther, on the subject which alone concerned me; nor could you have\r\nmade me discredit the evidence of my senses. I desired our intimacy to\r\nbe discontinued at once, as you yourself had acknowledged would\r\nprobably be the case if I knew all; but I did not wish to upbraid\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x94though (as you also acknowledged) you had deeply wronged me. Yes,\r\nyou have done me an injury you can never repair\xe2\x80\x94or any other either\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nhave blighted the freshness and promise of youth, and made my life a\r\nwilderness! I might live a hundred years, but I could never recover\r\nfrom the effects of this withering blow\xe2\x80\x94and never forget it!\r\nHereafter\xe2\x80\x94You smile, Mrs. Graham,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, suddenly stopping short,\r\nchecked in my passionate declamation by unutterable feelings to behold\r\nher actually _smiling_ at the picture of the ruin she had wrought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, looking seriously up; \xe2\x80\x9cI was not aware of it. If\r\nI did, it was not for pleasure at the thoughts of the harm I had done\r\nyou. Heaven knows I have had torment enough at the bare possibility of\r\nthat; it was for joy to find that you had some depth of soul and\r\nfeeling after all, and to hope that I had not been utterly mistaken in\r\nyour worth. But smiles and tears are so alike with me, they are neither\r\nof them confined to any particular feelings: I often cry when I am\r\nhappy, and smile when I am sad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me again, and seemed to expect a reply; but I continued\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you be _very_ glad,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed she, \xe2\x80\x9cto find that you were\r\nmistaken in your conclusions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask it, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say I can clear myself altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, speaking low and\r\nfast, while her heart beat visibly and her bosom heaved with\r\nexcitement,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut would you be glad to discover I was better than you\r\nthink me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything that could in the least degree tend to restore my former\r\nopinion of you, to excuse the regard I still feel for you, and\r\nalleviate the pangs of unutterable regret that accompany it, would be\r\nonly too gladly, too eagerly received!\xe2\x80\x9d Her cheeks burned, and her\r\nwhole frame trembled, now, with excess of agitation. She did not speak,\r\nbut flew to her desk, and snatching thence what seemed a thick album or\r\nmanuscript volume, hastily tore away a few leaves from the end, and\r\nthrust the rest into my hand, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t read it all; but\r\ntake it home with you,\xe2\x80\x9d and hurried from the room. But when I had left\r\nthe house, and was proceeding down the walk, she opened the window and\r\ncalled me back. It was only to say,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBring it back when you have read\r\nit; and don\xe2\x80\x99t breathe a word of what it tells you to any living being.\r\nI trust to your honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer she had closed the casement and turned away. I\r\nsaw her cast herself back in the old oak chair, and cover her face with\r\nher hands. Her feelings had been wrought to a pitch that rendered it\r\nnecessary to seek relief in tears.\r\n\r\nPanting with eagerness, and struggling to suppress my hopes, I hurried\r\nhome, and rushed up-stairs to my room, having first provided myself\r\nwith a candle, though it was scarcely twilight yet\xe2\x80\x94then, shut and\r\nbolted the door, determined to tolerate no interruption; and sitting\r\ndown before the table, opened out my prize and delivered myself up to\r\nits perusal\xe2\x80\x94first hastily turning over the leaves and snatching a\r\nsentence here and there, and then setting myself steadily to read it\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nI have it now before me; and though you could not, of course, peruse it\r\nwith half the interest that I did, I know you would not be satisfied\r\nwith an abbreviation of its contents, and you shall have the whole,\r\nsave, perhaps, a few passages here and there of merely temporary\r\ninterest to the writer, or such as would serve to encumber the story\r\nrather than elucidate it. It begins somewhat abruptly, thus\xe2\x80\x94but we will\r\nreserve its commencement for another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 1st, 1821.\xe2\x80\x94We have just returned to Staningley\xe2\x80\x94that is, we\r\nreturned some days ago, and I am not yet settled, and feel as if I\r\nnever should be. We left town sooner than was intended, in consequence\r\nof my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s indisposition;\xe2\x80\x94I wonder what would have been the result\r\nif we had stayed the full time. I am quite ashamed of my new-sprung\r\ndistaste for country life. All my former occupations seem so tedious\r\nand dull, my former amusements so insipid and unprofitable. I cannot\r\nenjoy my music, because there is no one to hear it. I cannot enjoy my\r\nwalks, because there is no one to meet. I cannot enjoy my books,\r\nbecause they have not power to arrest my attention: my head is so\r\nhaunted with the recollections of the last few weeks, that I cannot\r\nattend to them. My drawing suits me best, for I can draw and think at\r\nthe same time; and if my productions cannot now be seen by any one but\r\nmyself, and those who do not care about them, they, possibly, may be,\r\nhereafter. But, then, there is one face I am always trying to paint or\r\nto sketch, and always without success; and that vexes me. As for the\r\nowner of that face, I cannot get him out of my mind\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, I\r\nnever try. I wonder whether he ever thinks of me; and I wonder whether\r\nI shall ever see him again. And then might follow a train of other\r\nwonderments\xe2\x80\x94questions for time and fate to answer\xe2\x80\x94concluding\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94Supposing all the rest be answered in the affirmative, I wonder\r\nwhether I shall ever repent it? as my aunt would tell me I should, if\r\nshe knew what I was thinking about.\r\n\r\nHow distinctly I remember our conversation that evening before our\r\ndeparture for town, when we were sitting together over the fire, my\r\nuncle having gone to bed with a slight attack of the gout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, after a thoughtful silence, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you ever think about\r\nmarriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, aunt, often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you ever contemplate the possibility of being married yourself,\r\nor engaged, before the season is over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it at all likely that I _ever_ shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, I imagine, there must be only a very, very few men in the\r\nworld that I should like to marry; and of those few, it is ten to one I\r\nmay never be acquainted with one; or if I should, it is twenty to one\r\nhe may not happen to be single, or to take a fancy to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no argument at all. It may be very true\xe2\x80\x94and I hope is true,\r\nthat there are very few men whom you would choose to marry, of\r\nyourself. It is not, indeed, to be supposed that you would _wish_ to\r\nmarry _any_ one till you were asked: a girl\xe2\x80\x99s affections should never\r\nbe won unsought. But when they _are_ sought\xe2\x80\x94when the citadel of the\r\nheart is fairly besieged\xe2\x80\x94it is apt to surrender sooner than the owner\r\nis aware of, and often against her better judgment, and in opposition\r\nto all her preconceived ideas of what she could have loved, unless she\r\nbe extremely careful and discreet. Now, I want to warn you, Helen, of\r\nthese things, and to exhort you to be watchful and circumspect from the\r\nvery commencement of your career, and not to suffer your heart to be\r\nstolen from you by the first foolish or unprincipled person that covets\r\nthe possession of it.\xe2\x80\x94You know, my dear, you are only just eighteen;\r\nthere is plenty of time before you, and neither your uncle nor I are in\r\nany hurry to get you off our hands, and I may venture to say, there\r\nwill be no lack of suitors; for you can boast a good family, a pretty\r\nconsiderable fortune and expectations, and, I may as well tell you\r\nlikewise\xe2\x80\x94for, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t, others will\xe2\x80\x94that you have a fair share of\r\nbeauty besides\xe2\x80\x94and I hope you may never have cause to regret it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not, aunt; but why should you fear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, my dear, beauty is that quality which, next to money, is\r\ngenerally the most attractive to the worst kinds of men; and,\r\ntherefore, it is likely to entail a great deal of trouble on the\r\npossessor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave _you_ been troubled in that way, aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with reproachful gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know many that\r\nhave; and some, through carelessness, have been the wretched victims of\r\ndeceit; and some, through weakness, have fallen into snares and\r\ntemptations terrible to relate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall be neither careless nor weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember Peter, Helen! Don\xe2\x80\x99t boast, but _watch_. Keep a guard over\r\nyour eyes and ears as the inlets of your heart, and over your lips as\r\nthe outlet, lest they betray you in a moment of unwariness. Receive,\r\ncoldly and dispassionately, every attention, till you have ascertained\r\nand duly considered the worth of the aspirant; and let your affections\r\nbe consequent upon approbation alone. First study; then approve; then\r\nlove. Let your eyes be blind to all external attractions, your ears\r\ndeaf to all the fascinations of flattery and light discourse.\xe2\x80\x94These are\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94and worse than nothing\xe2\x80\x94snares and wiles of the tempter, to lure\r\nthe thoughtless to their own destruction. Principle is the first thing,\r\nafter all; and next to that, good sense, respectability, and moderate\r\nwealth. If you should marry the handsomest, and most accomplished and\r\nsuperficially agreeable man in the world, you little know the misery\r\nthat would overwhelm you if, after all, you should find him to be a\r\nworthless reprobate, or even an impracticable fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are all the poor fools and reprobates to do, aunt? If\r\neverybody followed your advice, the world would soon come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear, my dear! the male fools and reprobates will never want for\r\npartners, while there are so many of the other sex to match them; but\r\ndo _you_ follow my advice. And this is no subject for jesting, Helen\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nam sorry to see you treat the matter in that light way. Believe me,\r\n_matrimony is a serious thing_.\xe2\x80\x9d And she spoke it _so_ seriously, that\r\none might have fancied she had known it to her cost; but I asked no\r\nmore impertinent questions, and merely answered,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it is; and I know there is truth and sense in what you say; but\r\nyou need not fear me, for I not only should think it _wrong_ to marry a\r\nman that was deficient in sense or in principle, but I should never be\r\n_tempted_ to do it; for I could not like him, if he were ever so\r\nhandsome, and ever so charming, in other respects; I should hate\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94despise him\xe2\x80\x94pity him\xe2\x80\x94anything but love him. My affections not only\r\n_ought_ to be founded on approbation, but they will and must be so:\r\nfor, without approving, I cannot love. It is needless to say, I ought\r\nto be able to respect and honour the man I marry, as _well_ as love\r\nhim, for I cannot love him without. So set your mind at rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _know_ it _is_ so,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not been tried yet, Helen\xe2\x80\x94we can but hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said she in her\r\ncold, cautious way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was vexed at her incredulity; but I am not sure her doubts were\r\nentirely without sagacity; I fear I have found it much easier to\r\nremember her advice than to profit by it;\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I have sometimes been\r\nled to question the soundness of her doctrines on those subjects. Her\r\ncounsels may be good, as far as they go\xe2\x80\x94in the main points at\r\nleast;\xe2\x80\x94but there are some things she has overlooked in her\r\ncalculations. I wonder if _she_ was ever in love.\r\n\r\nI commenced my career\xe2\x80\x94or my first campaign, as my uncle calls\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94kindling with bright hopes and fancies\xe2\x80\x94chiefly raised by this\r\nconversation\xe2\x80\x94and full of confidence in my own discretion. At first, I\r\nwas delighted with the novelty and excitement of our London life; but\r\nsoon I began to weary of its mingled turbulence and constraint, and\r\nsigh for the freshness and freedom of home. My new acquaintances, both\r\nmale and female, disappointed my expectations, and vexed and depressed\r\nme by turns; for I soon grew tired of studying their peculiarities, and\r\nlaughing at their foibles\xe2\x80\x94particularly as I was obliged to keep my\r\ncriticisms to myself, for my aunt would not hear them\xe2\x80\x94and they\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nladies especially\xe2\x80\x94appeared so provokingly mindless, and heartless, and\r\nartificial. The gentlemen seemed better, but, perhaps, it was because I\r\nknew them less\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, because they flattered me; but I did not fall\r\nin love with any of them; and, if their attentions pleased me one\r\nmoment, they provoked me the next, because they put me out of humour\r\nwith myself, by revealing my vanity and making me fear I was becoming\r\nlike some of the ladies I so heartily despised.\r\n\r\nThere was one elderly gentleman that annoyed me very much; a rich old\r\nfriend of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, who, I believe, thought I could not do better\r\nthan marry him; but, besides being old, he was ugly and\r\ndisagreeable,\xe2\x80\x94and wicked, I am sure, though my aunt scolded me for\r\nsaying so; but she allowed he was no saint. And there was another, less\r\nhateful, but still _more_ tiresome, because she favoured him, and was\r\nalways thrusting him upon me, and sounding his praises in my ears\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nBoarham by name, Bore\xe2\x80\x99em, as I prefer spelling it, for a terrible bore\r\nhe was: I shudder still at the remembrance of his voice\xe2\x80\x94drone, drone,\r\ndrone, in my ear\xe2\x80\x94while he sat beside me, prosing away by the half-hour\r\ntogether, and beguiling himself with the notion that he was improving\r\nmy mind by useful information, or impressing his dogmas upon me and\r\nreforming my errors of judgment, or perhaps that he was talking down to\r\nmy level, and amusing me with entertaining discourse. Yet he was a\r\ndecent man enough in the main, I daresay; and if he had kept his\r\ndistance, I never would have hated him. As it was, it was almost\r\nimpossible to help it, for he not only bothered me with the infliction\r\nof his own presence, but he kept me from the enjoyment of more\r\nagreeable society.\r\n\r\nOne night, however, at a ball, he had been more than usually\r\ntormenting, and my patience was quite exhausted. It appeared as if the\r\nwhole evening was fated to be insupportable: I had just had one dance\r\nwith an empty-headed coxcomb, and then Mr. Boarham had come upon me and\r\nseemed determined to cling to me for the rest of the night. He never\r\ndanced himself, and there he sat, poking his head in my face, and\r\nimpressing all beholders with the idea that he was a confirmed,\r\nacknowledged lover; my aunt looking complacently on all the time, and\r\nwishing him God-speed. In vain I attempted to drive him away by giving\r\na loose to my exasperated feelings, even to positive rudeness: nothing\r\ncould convince him that his presence was disagreeable. Sullen silence\r\nwas taken for rapt attention, and gave him greater room to talk; sharp\r\nanswers were received as smart sallies of girlish vivacity, that only\r\nrequired an indulgent rebuke; and flat contradictions were but as oil\r\nto the flames, calling forth new strains of argument to support his\r\ndogmas, and bringing down upon me endless floods of reasoning to\r\noverwhelm me with conviction.\r\n\r\nBut there was one present who seemed to have a better appreciation of\r\nmy frame of mind. A gentleman stood by, who had been watching our\r\nconference for some time, evidently much amused at my companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremorseless pertinacity and my manifest annoyance, and laughing to\r\nhimself at the asperity and uncompromising spirit of my replies. At\r\nlength, however, he withdrew, and went to the lady of the house,\r\napparently for the purpose of asking an introduction to me, for,\r\nshortly after, they both came up, and she introduced him as Mr.\r\nHuntingdon, the son of a late friend of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s. He asked me to\r\ndance. I gladly consented, of course; and he was my companion during\r\nthe remainder of my stay, which was not long, for my aunt, as usual,\r\ninsisted upon an early departure.\r\n\r\nI was sorry to go, for I had found my new acquaintance a very lively\r\nand entertaining companion. There was a certain graceful ease and\r\nfreedom about all he said and did, that gave a sense of repose and\r\nexpansion to the mind, after so much constraint and formality as I had\r\nbeen doomed to suffer. There might be, it is true, a little too much\r\ncareless boldness in his manner and address, but I was in so good a\r\nhumour, and so grateful for my late deliverance from Mr. Boarham, that\r\nit did not anger me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Helen, how do you like Mr. Boarham now?\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt, as we\r\ntook our seats in the carriage and drove away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\nShe looked displeased, but said no more on that subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the gentleman you danced with last,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed she, after a\r\npause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat was so officious in helping you on with your shawl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was not officious at all, aunt: he never _attempted_ to help me,\r\ntill he saw Mr. Boarham coming to do so; and then he stepped laughingly\r\nforward and said, \xe2\x80\x98Come, I\xe2\x80\x99ll preserve you from that infliction.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it, I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with frigid gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Mr. Huntingdon, the son of uncle\xe2\x80\x99s old friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard your uncle speak of young Mr. Huntingdon. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a fine lad, that young Huntingdon, but a bit wildish, I\r\nfancy.\xe2\x80\x99 So I\xe2\x80\x99d have you beware.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does \xe2\x80\x98a bit wildish\xe2\x80\x99 mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means destitute of principle, and prone to every vice that is\r\ncommon to youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard uncle say he was a sad wild fellow himself, when he was\r\nyoung.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sternly shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was jesting then, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand here he was speaking at\r\nrandom\xe2\x80\x94at least, I cannot believe there is any harm in those laughing\r\nblue eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFalse reasoning, Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we ought to be charitable, you know, aunt\xe2\x80\x94besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nit _is_ false: I am an excellent physiognomist, and I always judge of\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s characters by their looks\xe2\x80\x94not by whether they are handsome or\r\nugly, but by the general cast of the countenance. For instance, I\r\nshould know by your countenance that you were not of a cheerful,\r\nsanguine disposition; and I should know by Mr. Wilmot\xe2\x80\x99s, that he was a\r\nworthless old reprobate; and by Mr. Boarham\xe2\x80\x99s, that he was not an\r\nagreeable companion; and by Mr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s, that he was neither a\r\nfool nor a knave, though, possibly, neither a sage nor a saint\xe2\x80\x94but that\r\nis no matter to me, as I am not likely to meet him again\xe2\x80\x94unless as an\r\noccasional partner in the ball-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not so, however, for I met him again next morning. He came to\r\ncall upon my uncle, apologising for not having done so before, by\r\nsaying he was only lately returned from the Continent, and had not\r\nheard, till the previous night, of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in town; and\r\nafter that I often met him; sometimes in public, sometimes at home; for\r\nhe was very assiduous in paying his respects to his old friend, who did\r\nnot, however, consider himself greatly obliged by the attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what the deuce the lad means by coming so often,\xe2\x80\x9d he would\r\nsay,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccan _you_ tell, Helen?\xe2\x80\x94Hey? He wants none o\xe2\x80\x99 my company, nor I\r\nhis\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d tell him so, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what for? If I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him, somebody does, mayhap\xe2\x80\x9d (winking at\r\nme). \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, he\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty tidy fortune, Peggy, you know\xe2\x80\x94not such a\r\ncatch as Wilmot; but then Helen won\xe2\x80\x99t hear of that match: for, somehow,\r\nthese old chaps don\xe2\x80\x99t go down with the girls\xe2\x80\x94with _all_ their money,\r\nand their experience to boot. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet anything she\xe2\x80\x99d rather have this\r\nyoung fellow without a penny, than Wilmot with his house full of gold.\r\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Nell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, uncle; but that\xe2\x80\x99s not saying much for Mr. Huntingdon; for I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather be an old maid and a pauper than Mrs. Wilmot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mrs. Huntingdon? What would you rather be than Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you when I\xe2\x80\x99ve considered the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it needs consideration, then? But come, now\xe2\x80\x94would you rather be an\r\nold maid\xe2\x80\x94let alone the pauper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell till I\xe2\x80\x99m asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I left the room immediately, to escape further examination. But\r\nfive minutes after, in looking from my window, I beheld Mr. Boarham\r\ncoming up to the door. I waited nearly half-an-hour in uncomfortable\r\nsuspense, expecting every minute to be called, and vainly longing to\r\nhear him go. Then footsteps were heard on the stairs, and my aunt\r\nentered the room with a solemn countenance, and closed the door behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is Mr. Boarham, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wishes to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, aunt!\xe2\x80\x94Can\xe2\x80\x99t you tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m indisposed?\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I am\xe2\x80\x94to see\r\n_him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, my dear! this is no trifling matter. He is come on a very\r\nimportant errand\xe2\x80\x94to ask your hand in marriage of your uncle and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope my uncle and you told him it was not in your power to give it.\r\nWhat right had he to ask _any_ one before me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did my uncle say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said he would not interfere in the matter; if you liked to accept\r\nMr. Boarham\xe2\x80\x99s obliging offer, you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say obliging offer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he said if you liked to take him you might; and if not, you might\r\nplease yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said right; and what did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no matter what I said. What will _you_ say?\xe2\x80\x94that is the\r\nquestion. He is now waiting to ask you himself; but consider well\r\nbefore you go; and if you intend to refuse him, give me your reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _shall_ refuse him, of course; but you must tell me how, for I want\r\nto be civil and yet decided\xe2\x80\x94and when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got rid of him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you\r\nmy reasons afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut stay, Helen; sit down a little and compose yourself. Mr. Boarham\r\nis in no particular hurry, for he has little doubt of your acceptance;\r\nand I want to speak with you. Tell me, my dear, what are your\r\nobjections to him? Do you deny that he is an upright, honourable man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you deny that he is sensible, sober, respectable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he may be all this, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_But_ Helen! How many such men do you expect to meet with in the\r\nworld? Upright, honourable, sensible, sober, respectable! Is _this_\r\nsuch an every-day character that you should reject the possessor of\r\nsuch noble qualities without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation? Yes, _noble_ I may\r\ncall them; for think of the full meaning of each, and how many\r\ninestimable virtues they include (and I might add many more to the\r\nlist), and consider that all this is laid at your feet. It is in your\r\npower to secure this inestimable blessing for life\xe2\x80\x94a worthy and\r\nexcellent husband, who loves you tenderly, but not too fondly so as to\r\nblind him to your faults, and will be your guide throughout life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npilgrimage, and your partner in eternal bliss. Think how\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hate him, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, interrupting this unusual flow of\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHate him, Helen! Is this a Christian spirit?\xe2\x80\x94_you hate him?_ and he so\r\ngood a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hate him as a man, but as a husband. As a man, I love him so\r\nmuch that I wish him a better wife than I\xe2\x80\x94one as good as himself, or\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x94if you think that possible\xe2\x80\x94provided she could like him; but I\r\nnever could, and therefore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not? What objection do you find?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, he is at least forty years old\xe2\x80\x94considerably more, I should\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94and I am but eighteen; secondly, he is narrow-minded and bigoted\r\nin the extreme; thirdly, his tastes and feelings are wholly dissimilar\r\nto mine; fourthly, his looks, voice, and manner are particularly\r\ndispleasing to me; and, finally, I have an aversion to his whole person\r\nthat I never can surmount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you ought to surmount it. And please to compare him for a moment\r\nwith Mr. Huntingdon, and, good looks apart (which contribute nothing to\r\nthe merit of the man, or to the happiness of married life, and which\r\nyou have so often professed to hold in light esteem), tell me which is\r\nthe better man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt Mr. Huntingdon is a much better man than you think\r\nhim; but we are not talking about him now, but about Mr. Boarham; and\r\nas I would rather grow, live, and die in single blessedness\xe2\x80\x94than be his\r\nwife, it is but right that I should tell him so at once, and put him\r\nout of suspense\xe2\x80\x94so let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t give him a flat denial; he has no idea of such a thing, and\r\nit would offend him greatly: say you have no thoughts of matrimony at\r\npresent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I _have_ thoughts of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr that you desire a further acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t desire a further acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94quite the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting for further admonitions I left the room and went to\r\nseek Mr. Boarham. He was walking up and down the drawing-room, humming\r\nsnatches of tunes and nibbling the end of his cane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, bowing and smirking with great\r\ncomplacency, \xe2\x80\x9cI have your kind guardian\xe2\x80\x99s permission\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, wishing to shorten the scene as much as\r\npossible, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am greatly obliged for your preference, but must beg\r\nto decline the honour you wish to confer, for I think we were not made\r\nfor each other, as you yourself would shortly discover if the\r\nexperiment were tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy aunt was right. It was quite evident he had had little doubt of my\r\nacceptance, and no idea of a positive denial. He was amazed, astounded\r\nat such an answer, but too incredulous to be much offended; and after a\r\nlittle humming and hawing, he returned to the attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, my dear, that there exists a considerable disparity between us\r\nin years, in temperament, and perhaps some other things; but let me\r\nassure you, I shall not be severe to mark the faults and foibles of a\r\nyoung and ardent nature such as yours, and while I acknowledge them to\r\nmyself, and even rebuke them with all a father\xe2\x80\x99s care, believe me, no\r\nyouthful lover could be more tenderly indulgent towards the object of\r\nhis affections than I to you; and, on the other hand, let me hope that\r\nmy more experienced years and graver habits of reflection will be no\r\ndisparagement in your eyes, as I shall endeavour to make them all\r\nconducive to your happiness. Come, now! What do you say? Let us have no\r\nyoung lady\xe2\x80\x99s affectations and caprices, but speak out at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, but only to repeat what I said before, that I am certain we\r\nwere not made for each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t know me\xe2\x80\x94you wish for a further acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94a longer\r\ntime to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I know you as well as I ever shall, and better than you\r\nknow me, or you would never dream of uniting yourself to one so\r\nincongruous\xe2\x80\x94so utterly unsuitable to you in every way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear young lady, I don\xe2\x80\x99t look for perfection; I can excuse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. Boarham, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t trespass upon your goodness. You\r\nmay save your indulgence and consideration for some more worthy object,\r\nthat won\xe2\x80\x99t tax them so heavily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let me beg you to consult your aunt; that excellent lady, I am\r\nsure, will\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have consulted her; and I know her wishes coincide with yours; but\r\nin such important matters, I take the liberty of judging for myself;\r\nand no persuasion can alter my inclinations, or induce me to believe\r\nthat such a step would be conducive to my happiness or yours\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nwonder that a man of your experience and discretion should think of\r\nchoosing such a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI have sometimes wondered at that myself. I have\r\nsometimes said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98Now Boarham, what is this you\xe2\x80\x99re after? Take\r\ncare, man\xe2\x80\x94look before you leap! This is a sweet, bewitching creature,\r\nbut remember, the brightest attractions to the lover too often prove\r\nthe husband\xe2\x80\x99s greatest torments!\xe2\x80\x99 I assure you my choice has not been\r\nmade without much reasoning and reflection. The seeming imprudence of\r\nthe match has cost me many an anxious thought by day, and many a\r\nsleepless hour by night; but at length I satisfied myself that it was\r\nnot, in very deed, imprudent. I saw my sweet girl was not without her\r\nfaults, but of these her youth, I trusted, was not one, but rather an\r\nearnest of virtues yet unblown\xe2\x80\x94a strong ground of presumption that her\r\nlittle defects of temper and errors of judgment, opinion, or manner\r\nwere not irremediable, but might easily be removed or mitigated by the\r\npatient efforts of a watchful and judicious adviser, and where I failed\r\nto enlighten and control, I thought I might safely undertake to pardon,\r\nfor the sake of her many excellences. Therefore, my dearest girl, since\r\n_I_ am satisfied, why should _you_ object\xe2\x80\x94on my account, at least?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to tell you the truth, Mr. Boarham, it is on my own account I\r\nprincipally object; so let us\xe2\x80\x94drop the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d I would have said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor it is worse than useless to pursue it any further,\xe2\x80\x9d but he\r\npertinaciously interrupted me with,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut why so? I would love you,\r\ncherish you, protect you,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., &c.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble myself to put down all that passed between us.\r\nSuffice it to say, that I found him very troublesome, and very hard to\r\nconvince that I really meant what I said, and really _was_ so obstinate\r\nand blind to my own interests, that there was no shadow of a chance\r\nthat either he or my aunt would ever be able to overcome my objections.\r\nIndeed, I am not sure that I succeeded after all; though wearied with\r\nhis so pertinaciously returning to the same point and repeating the\r\nsame arguments over and over again, forcing me to reiterate the same\r\nreplies, I at length turned short and sharp upon him, and my last words\r\nwere,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you plainly, that it cannot be. No consideration can\r\ninduce me to marry against my inclinations. I respect you\xe2\x80\x94at least, I\r\nwould respect you, if you would behave like a sensible man\xe2\x80\x94but I cannot\r\nlove you, and never could\xe2\x80\x94and the more you talk the further you repel\r\nme; so pray don\xe2\x80\x99t say any more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon he wished me a good-morning, and withdrew, disconcerted and\r\noffended, no doubt; but surely it was not my fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day I accompanied my uncle and aunt to a dinner-party at Mr.\r\nWilmot\xe2\x80\x99s. He had two ladies staying with him: his niece Annabella, a\r\nfine dashing girl, or rather young woman,\xe2\x80\x94of some five-and-twenty, too\r\ngreat a flirt to be married, according to her own assertion, but\r\ngreatly admired by the gentlemen, who universally pronounced her a\r\nsplendid woman; and her gentle cousin, Milicent Hargrave, who had taken\r\na violent fancy to me, mistaking me for something vastly better than I\r\nwas. And I, in return, was very fond of her. I should entirely exclude\r\npoor Milicent in my general animadversions against the ladies of my\r\nacquaintance. But it was not on her account, or her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s, that I\r\nhave mentioned the party: it was for the sake of another of Mr.\r\nWilmot\xe2\x80\x99s guests, to wit Mr. Huntingdon. I have good reason to remember\r\nhis presence there, for this was the last time I saw him.\r\n\r\nHe did not sit near me at dinner; for it was his fate to hand in a\r\ncapacious old dowager, and mine to be handed in by Mr. Grimsby, a\r\nfriend of his, but a man I very greatly disliked: there was a sinister\r\ncast in his countenance, and a mixture of lurking ferocity and fulsome\r\ninsincerity in his demeanour, that I could not away with. What a\r\ntiresome custom that is, by-the-by\xe2\x80\x94one among the many sources of\r\nfactitious annoyance of this ultra-civilised life. If the gentlemen\r\n_must_ lead the ladies into the dining-room, why cannot they take those\r\nthey like best?\r\n\r\nI am not sure, however, that Mr. Huntingdon would have taken me, if he\r\n_had_ been at liberty to make his own selection. It is quite possible\r\nhe might have chosen Miss Wilmot; for she seemed bent upon engrossing\r\nhis attention to herself, and he seemed nothing loth to pay the homage\r\nshe demanded. I thought so, at least, when I saw how they talked and\r\nlaughed, and glanced across the table, to the neglect and evident\r\numbrage of their respective neighbours\xe2\x80\x94and afterwards, as the gentlemen\r\njoined us in the drawing-room, when she, immediately upon his entrance,\r\nloudly called upon him to be the arbiter of a dispute between herself\r\nand another lady, and he answered the summons with alacrity, and\r\ndecided the question without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation in her\r\nfavour\xe2\x80\x94though, to my thinking, she was obviously in the wrong\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nstood chatting familiarly with her and a group of other ladies; while I\r\nsat with Milicent Hargrave at the opposite end of the room, looking\r\nover the latter\xe2\x80\x99s drawings, and aiding her with my critical\r\nobservations and advice, at her particular desire. But in spite of my\r\nefforts to remain composed, my attention wandered from the drawings to\r\nthe merry group, and against my better judgment my wrath rose, and\r\ndoubtless my countenance lowered; for Milicent, observing that I must\r\nbe tired of her daubs and scratches, begged I would join the company\r\nnow, and defer the examination of the remainder to another opportunity.\r\nBut while I was assuring her that I had no wish to join them, and was\r\nnot tired, Mr. Huntingdon himself came up to the little round table at\r\nwhich we sat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre these yours?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, carelessly taking up one of the drawings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they are Miss Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! well, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, regardless of Miss Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s protestations that they were not\r\nworth looking at, he drew a chair to my side, and receiving the\r\ndrawings, one by one from my hand, successively scanned them over, and\r\nthrew them on the table, but said not a word about them, though he was\r\ntalking all the time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Milicent Hargrave thought of\r\nsuch conduct, but _I_ found his conversation extremely interesting;\r\nthough, as I afterwards discovered, when I came to analyse it, it was\r\nchiefly confined to quizzing the different members of the company\r\npresent; and albeit he made some clever remarks, and some excessively\r\ndroll ones, I do not think the whole would appear anything very\r\nparticular, if written here, without the adventitious aids of look, and\r\ntone, and gesture, and that ineffable but indefinite charm, which cast\r\na halo over all he did and said, and which would have made it a delight\r\nto look in his face, and hear the music of his voice, if he had been\r\ntalking positive nonsense\xe2\x80\x94and which, moreover, made me feel so bitter\r\nagainst my aunt when she put a stop to this enjoyment, by coming\r\ncomposedly forward, under pretence of wishing to see the drawings, that\r\nshe cared and knew nothing about, and while making believe to examine\r\nthem, addressing herself to Mr. Huntingdon, with one of her coldest and\r\nmost repellent aspects, and beginning a series of the most common-place\r\nand formidably formal questions and observations, on purpose to wrest\r\nhis attention from me\xe2\x80\x94on purpose to vex me, as I thought: and having\r\nnow looked through the portfolio, I left them to their _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_,\r\nand seated myself on a sofa, quite apart from the company\xe2\x80\x94never\r\nthinking how strange such conduct would appear, but merely to indulge,\r\nat first, the vexation of the moment, and subsequently to enjoy my\r\nprivate thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut I was not left long alone, for Mr. Wilmot, of all men the least\r\nwelcome, took advantage of my isolated position to come and plant\r\nhimself beside me. I had flattered myself that I had so effectually\r\nrepulsed his advances on all former occasions, that I had nothing more\r\nto apprehend from his unfortunate predilection; but it seems I was\r\nmistaken: so great was his confidence, either in his wealth or his\r\nremaining powers of attraction, and so firm his conviction of feminine\r\nweakness, that he thought himself warranted to return to the siege,\r\nwhich he did with renovated ardour, enkindled by the quantity of wine\r\nhe had drunk\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance that rendered him infinitely the more\r\ndisgusting; but greatly as I abhorred him at that moment, I did not\r\nlike to treat him with rudeness, as I was now his guest, and had just\r\nbeen enjoying his hospitality; and I was no hand at a polite but\r\ndetermined rejection, nor would it have greatly availed me if I had,\r\nfor he was too coarse-minded to take any repulse that was not as plain\r\nand positive as his own effrontery. The consequence was, that he waxed\r\nmore fulsomely tender, and more repulsively warm, and I was driven to\r\nthe very verge of desperation, and about to say I know not what, when I\r\nfelt my hand, that hung over the arm of the sofa, suddenly taken by\r\nanother and gently but fervently pressed. Instinctively, I guessed who\r\nit was, and, on looking up, was less surprised than delighted to see\r\nMr. Huntingdon smiling upon me. It was like turning from some\r\npurgatorial fiend to an angel of light, come to announce that the\r\nseason of torment was past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he (he frequently called me Helen, and I never resented\r\nthe freedom), \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to look at this picture. Mr. Wilmot will\r\nexcuse you a moment, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose with alacrity. He drew my arm within his, and led me across the\r\nroom to a splendid painting of Vandyke\xe2\x80\x99s that I had noticed before, but\r\nnot sufficiently examined. After a moment of silent contemplation, I\r\nwas beginning to comment on its beauties and peculiarities, when,\r\nplayfully pressing the hand he still retained within his arm, he\r\ninterrupted me with,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the picture: it was not for that I\r\nbrought you here; it was to get you away from that scoundrelly old\r\nprofligate yonder, who is looking as if he would like to challenge me\r\nfor the affront.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is twice you have\r\ndelivered me from such unpleasant companionship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too thankful,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cit is not all kindness to you;\r\nit is partly from a feeling of spite to your tormentors that makes me\r\ndelighted to do the old fellows a bad turn, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have\r\nany great reason to dread them as rivals. Have I, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I detest them both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no reason to detest _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are your sentiments towards me? Helen\xe2\x80\x94Speak! How do you\r\nregard me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again he pressed my hand; but I feared there was more of conscious\r\npower than tenderness in his demeanour, and I felt he had no right to\r\nextort a confession of attachment from me when he had made no\r\ncorrespondent avowal himself, and knew not what to answer. At last I\r\nsaid,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_ regard _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweet angel, I adore you! I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, I want you a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the distinct, low voice of my aunt,\r\nclose beside us. And I left him, muttering maledictions against his\r\nevil angel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, aunt, what is it? What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, following her to\r\nthe embrasure of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to join the company, when you are fit to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nshe, severely regarding me; \xe2\x80\x9cbut please to stay here a little, till\r\nthat shocking colour is somewhat abated, and your eyes have recovered\r\nsomething of their natural expression. I should be ashamed for anyone\r\nto see you in your present state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course, such a remark had no effect in reducing the \xe2\x80\x9cshocking\r\ncolour\xe2\x80\x9d; on the contrary, I felt my face glow with redoubled fires\r\nkindled by a complication of emotions, of which indignant, swelling\r\nanger was the chief. I offered no reply, however, but pushed aside the\r\ncurtain and looked into the night\xe2\x80\x94or rather into the lamp-lit square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Mr. Huntingdon proposing to you, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired my too watchful\r\nrelative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he saying then? I heard something very like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he would have said, if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupted him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you have accepted him, Helen, if he had proposed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not\xe2\x80\x94without consulting uncle and you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad, my dear, you have so much prudence left. Well, now,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have made yourself conspicuous\r\nenough for one evening. The ladies are directing inquiring glances\r\ntowards us at this moment, I see: I shall join them. Do you come too,\r\nwhen you are sufficiently composed to appear as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak gently then, and don\xe2\x80\x99t look so malicious,\xe2\x80\x9d said my calm, but\r\nprovoking aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall return home shortly, and then,\xe2\x80\x9d she added\r\nwith solemn significance, \xe2\x80\x9cI have much to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I went home prepared for a formidable lecture. Little was said by\r\neither party in the carriage during our short transit homewards; but\r\nwhen I had entered my room and thrown myself into an easy-chair, to\r\nreflect on the events of the day, my aunt followed me thither, and\r\nhaving dismissed Rachel, who was carefully stowing away my ornaments,\r\nclosed the door; and placing a chair beside me, or rather at right\r\nangles with mine, sat down. With due deference I offered her my more\r\ncommodious seat. She declined it, and thus opened the conference: \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou remember, Helen, our conversation the night but one before we left\r\nStaningley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you remember how I warned you against letting your heart be\r\nstolen from you by those unworthy of its possession, and fixing your\r\naffections where approbation did not go before, and where reason and\r\njudgment withheld their sanction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but _my_ reason\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me\xe2\x80\x94and do you remember assuring me that there was no occasion\r\nfor uneasiness on your account; for you should never be _tempted_ to\r\nmarry a man who was deficient in sense or principle, however handsome\r\nor charming in other respects he might be, for you could not love him;\r\nyou should hate\xe2\x80\x94despise\xe2\x80\x94pity\xe2\x80\x94anything but love him\xe2\x80\x94were not those your\r\nwords?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you not say that your affection _must_ be founded on\r\napprobation; and that, unless you could approve and honour and respect,\r\nyou could not love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I do approve, and honour, and respect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, my dear? Is Mr. Huntingdon a good man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a much better man than you think him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is nothing to the purpose. Is he a _good_ man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94in some respects. He has a good disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he a man of _principle?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not, exactly; but it is only for want of thought. If he had\r\nsome one to advise him, and remind him of what is right\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would soon learn, you think\xe2\x80\x94and you yourself would willingly\r\nundertake to be his teacher? But, my dear, he is, I believe, full ten\r\nyears older than you\xe2\x80\x94how is it that you are so beforehand in moral\r\nacquirements?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to you, aunt, I have been well brought up, and had good\r\nexamples always before me, which he, most likely, has not; and,\r\nbesides, he is of a sanguine temperament, and a gay, thoughtless\r\ntemper, and I am naturally inclined to reflection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now you have made him out to be deficient in both sense and\r\nprinciple, by your own confession\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, my sense and my principle are at his service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds presumptuous, Helen. Do you think you have enough for\r\nboth; and do you imagine your merry, thoughtless profligate would allow\r\nhimself to be guided by a young girl like you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I should not wish to guide him; but I think I might have influence\r\nsufficient to save him from some errors, and I should think my life\r\nwell spent in the effort to preserve so noble a nature from\r\ndestruction. He always listens attentively now when I speak seriously\r\nto him (and I often venture to reprove his random way of talking), and\r\nsometimes he says that if he had me always by his side he should never\r\ndo or say a wicked thing, and that a little daily talk with me would\r\nmake him quite a saint. It may he partly jest and partly flattery, but\r\nstill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still you think it may be truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do think there is any mixture of truth in it, it is not from\r\nconfidence in my own powers, but in _his_ natural goodness. And you\r\nhave no right to call him a profligate, aunt; he is nothing of the\r\nkind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you so, my dear? What was that story about his intrigue with\r\na married lady\xe2\x80\x94Lady who was it?\xe2\x80\x94Miss Wilmot herself was telling you the\r\nother day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was false\xe2\x80\x94false!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think, then, that he is a virtuous, well-conducted young man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing positive respecting his character. I only know that I\r\nhave heard nothing definite against it\xe2\x80\x94nothing that could be proved, at\r\nleast; and till people can prove their slanderous accusations, I will\r\nnot believe them. And I know this, that if he has committed errors,\r\nthey are only such as are common to youth, and such as nobody thinks\r\nanything about; for I see that everybody likes him, and all the mammas\r\nsmile upon him, and their daughters\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Wilmot herself\xe2\x80\x94are only\r\ntoo glad to attract his attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, the world _may_ look upon such offences as venial; a few\r\nunprincipled mothers may be anxious to catch a young man of fortune\r\nwithout reference _may_ his character; and thoughtless girls _may_ be\r\nglad to win the smiles of so handsome a gentleman, without seeking to\r\npenetrate beyond the surface; but _you_, I trusted, were better\r\ninformed than to see with their eyes, and judge with their perverted\r\njudgment. I did not think _you_ would call these venial errors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor do I, aunt; but if I hate the sins, I love the sinner, and would\r\ndo much for his salvation, even supposing your suspicions to be mainly\r\ntrue, which I do not and will not believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, ask your uncle what sort of company he keeps, and if he\r\nis not banded with a set of loose, profligate young men, whom he calls\r\nhis friends, his jolly companions, and whose chief delight is to wallow\r\nin vice, and vie with each other who can run fastest and furthest down\r\nthe headlong road to the place prepared for the devil and his angels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will save him from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Helen, Helen! you little know the misery of uniting your fortunes\r\nto such a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have such confidence in him, aunt, notwithstanding all you say, that\r\nI would willingly risk my happiness for the chance of securing his. I\r\nwill leave better men to those who only consider their own advantage.\r\nIf he has done amiss, I shall consider my life well spent in saving him\r\nfrom the consequences of his early errors, and striving to recall him\r\nto the path of virtue. God grant me success!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the conversation ended, for at this juncture my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s voice was\r\nheard from his chamber, loudly calling upon my aunt to come to bed. He\r\nwas in a bad humour that night; for his gout was worse. It had been\r\ngradually increasing upon him ever since we came to town; and my aunt\r\ntook advantage of the circumstance next morning to persuade him to\r\nreturn to the country immediately, without waiting for the close of the\r\nseason. His physician supported and enforced her arguments; and\r\ncontrary to her usual habits, she so hurried the preparations for\r\nremoval (as much for my sake as my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, I think), that in a very\r\nfew days we departed; and I saw no more of Mr. Huntingdon. My aunt\r\nflatters herself I shall soon forget him\xe2\x80\x94perhaps she thinks I have\r\nforgotten him already, for I never mention his name; and she may\r\ncontinue to think so, till we meet again\xe2\x80\x94if ever that should be. I\r\nwonder if it will?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 25th.\xe2\x80\x94I am now quite settled down to my usual routine of steady\r\noccupations and quiet amusements\xe2\x80\x94tolerably contented and cheerful, but\r\nstill looking forward to spring with the hope of returning to town, not\r\nfor its gaieties and dissipations, but for the chance of meeting Mr.\r\nHuntingdon once again; for still he is always in my thoughts and in my\r\ndreams. In all my employments, whatever I do, or see, or hear, has an\r\nultimate reference to him; whatever skill or knowledge I acquire is\r\nsome day to be turned to his advantage or amusement; whatever new\r\nbeauties in nature or art I discover are to be depicted to meet his\r\neye, or stored in my memory to be told him at some future period. This,\r\nat least, is the hope that I cherish, the fancy that lights me on my\r\nlonely way. It may be only an ignis fatuus, after all, but it can do no\r\nharm to follow it with my eyes and rejoice in its lustre, as long as it\r\ndoes not lure me from the path I ought to keep; and I think it will\r\nnot, for I have thought deeply on my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and I see clearly,\r\nnow, the folly of throwing myself away on one that is unworthy of all\r\nthe love I have to give, and incapable of responding to the best and\r\ndeepest feelings of my inmost heart\xe2\x80\x94_so_ clearly, that even if I should\r\nsee him again, and if he should remember me and love me still (which,\r\nalas! is too little probable, considering how he is situated, and by\r\nwhom surrounded), and if he should ask me to marry him\xe2\x80\x94I am determined\r\nnot to consent until I know for certain whether my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of\r\nhim or mine is nearest the truth; for if mine is altogether wrong, it\r\nis not he that I love; it is a creature of my own imagination. But I\r\nthink it is not wrong\xe2\x80\x94no, no\xe2\x80\x94there is a secret something\xe2\x80\x94an inward\r\ninstinct that assures me I am right. There is essential goodness in\r\nhim;\xe2\x80\x94and what delight to unfold it! If he has wandered, what bliss to\r\nrecall him! If he is now exposed to the baneful influence of corrupting\r\nand wicked companions, what glory to deliver him from them! Oh! if I\r\ncould but believe that Heaven has designed me for this!\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day is the first of September; but my uncle has ordered the\r\ngamekeeper to spare the partridges till the gentlemen come. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ngentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked when I heard it. A small party he had invited to\r\nshoot. His friend Mr. Wilmot was one, and my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s friend, Mr.\r\nBoarham, another. This struck me as terrible news at the moment; but\r\nall regret and apprehension vanished like a dream when I heard that Mr.\r\nHuntingdon was actually to be a third! My aunt is greatly against his\r\ncoming, of course: she earnestly endeavoured to dissuade my uncle from\r\nasking him; but he, laughing at her objections, told her it was no use\r\ntalking, for the mischief was already done: he had invited Huntingdon\r\nand his friend Lord Lowborough before we left London, and nothing now\r\nremained but to fix the day for their coming. So he is safe, and I am\r\nsure of seeing him. I cannot express my joy. I find it very difficult\r\nto conceal it from my aunt; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to trouble her with my\r\nfeelings till I know whether I ought to indulge them or not. If I find\r\nit my absolute duty to suppress them, they shall trouble no one but\r\nmyself; and if I can really feel myself justified in indulging this\r\nattachment, I can dare anything, even the anger and grief of my best\r\nfriend, for its object\xe2\x80\x94surely, I shall soon know. But they are not\r\ncoming till about the middle of the month.\r\n\r\nWe are to have two lady visitors also: Mr. Wilmot is to bring his niece\r\nand her cousin Milicent. I suppose my aunt thinks the latter will\r\nbenefit me by her society, and the salutary example of her gentle\r\ndeportment and lowly and tractable spirit; and the former I suspect she\r\nintends as a species of counter-attraction to win Mr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention from me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t thank her for this; but I shall be glad of\r\nMilicent\xe2\x80\x99s company: she is a sweet, good girl, and I wish I were like\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94_more_ like her, at least, than I am.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n19th.\xe2\x80\x94They are come. They came the day before yesterday. The gentlemen\r\nare all gone out to shoot, and the ladies are with my aunt, at work in\r\nthe drawing-room. I have retired to the library, for I am very unhappy,\r\nand I want to be alone. Books cannot divert me; so having opened my\r\ndesk, I will try what may be done by detailing the cause of my\r\nuneasiness. This paper will serve instead of a confidential friend into\r\nwhose ear I might pour forth the overflowings of my heart. It will not\r\nsympathise with my distresses, but then it will not laugh at them, and,\r\nif I keep it close, it cannot tell again; so it is, perhaps, the best\r\nfriend I could have for the purpose.\r\n\r\nFirst, let me speak of his arrival\xe2\x80\x94how I sat at my window, and watched\r\nfor nearly two hours, before his carriage entered the park-gates\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthey all came before him,\xe2\x80\x94and how deeply I was disappointed at every\r\narrival, because it was not his. First came Mr. Wilmot and the ladies.\r\nWhen Milicent had got into her room, I quitted my post a few minutes to\r\nlook in upon her and have a little private conversation, for she was\r\nnow my intimate friend, several long epistles having passed between us\r\nsince our parting. On returning to my window, I beheld another carriage\r\nat the door. Was it his? No; it was Mr. Boarham\xe2\x80\x99s plain dark chariot;\r\nand there stood he upon the steps, carefully superintending the\r\ndislodging of his various boxes and packages. What a collection! One\r\nwould have thought he projected a visit of six months at least. A\r\nconsiderable time after, came Lord Lowborough in his barouche. Is he\r\none of the profligate friends, I wonder? I should think not; for no one\r\ncould call _him_ a jolly companion, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x94and, besides, he appears\r\ntoo sober and gentlemanly in his demeanour to merit such suspicions. He\r\nis a tall, thin, gloomy-looking man, apparently between thirty and\r\nforty, and of a somewhat sickly, careworn aspect.\r\n\r\nAt last, Mr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s light phaeton came bowling merrily up the\r\nlawn. I had but a transient glimpse of him: for the moment it stopped,\r\nhe sprang out over the side on to the portico steps, and disappeared\r\ninto the house.\r\n\r\nI now submitted to be dressed for dinner\xe2\x80\x94a duty which Rachel had been\r\nurging upon me for the last twenty minutes; and when that important\r\nbusiness was completed, I repaired to the drawing-room, where I found\r\nMr. and Miss Wilmot and Milicent Hargrave already assembled. Shortly\r\nafter, Lord Lowborough entered, and then Mr. Boarham, who seemed quite\r\nwilling to forget and forgive my former conduct, and to hope that a\r\nlittle conciliation and steady perseverance on his part might yet\r\nsucceed in bringing me to reason. While I stood at the window,\r\nconversing with Milicent, he came up to me, and was beginning to talk\r\nin nearly his usual strain, when Mr. Huntingdon entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will he greet me, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d said my bounding heart; and, instead\r\nof advancing to meet him, I turned to the window to hide or subdue my\r\nemotion. But having saluted his host and hostess, and the rest of the\r\ncompany, he came to me, ardently squeezed my hand, and murmured he was\r\nglad to see me once again. At that moment dinner was announced: my aunt\r\ndesired him to take Miss Hargrave into the dining-room, and odious Mr.\r\nWilmot, with unspeakable grimaces, offered his arm to me; and I was\r\ncondemned to sit between himself and Mr. Boarham. But afterwards, when\r\nwe were all again assembled in the drawing-room, I was indemnified for\r\nso much suffering by a few delightful minutes of conversation with Mr.\r\nHuntingdon.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening, Miss Wilmot was called upon to sing and\r\nplay for the amusement of the company, and I to exhibit my drawings,\r\nand, though he likes music, and she is an accomplished musician, I\r\nthink I am right in affirming, that he paid more attention to my\r\ndrawings than to her music.\r\n\r\nSo far so good;\xe2\x80\x94but hearing him pronounce, sotto voce, but with\r\npeculiar emphasis, concerning one of the pieces, \xe2\x80\x9cTHIS is better than\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I looked up, curious to see which it was, and, to my horror,\r\nbeheld him complacently gazing at the _back_ of the picture:\xe2\x80\x94it was his\r\nown face that I had sketched there and forgotten to rub out! To make\r\nmatters worse, in the agony of the moment, I attempted to snatch it\r\nfrom his hand; but he prevented me, and exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94by George, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nkeep it!\xe2\x80\x9d placed it against his waistcoat and buttoned his coat upon it\r\nwith a delighted chuckle.\r\n\r\nThen, drawing a candle close to his elbow, he gathered all the drawings\r\nto himself, as well what he had seen as the others, and muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust look at _both_ sides now,\xe2\x80\x9d he eagerly commenced an examination,\r\nwhich I watched, at first, with tolerable composure, in the confidence\r\nthat his vanity would not be gratified by any further discoveries; for,\r\nthough I must plead guilty to having disfigured the backs of several\r\nwith abortive attempts to delineate that too fascinating physiognomy, I\r\nwas sure that, with that one unfortunate exception, I had carefully\r\nobliterated all such witnesses of my infatuation. But the pencil\r\nfrequently leaves an impression upon cardboard that no amount of\r\nrubbing can efface. Such, it seems, was the case with most of these;\r\nand, I confess, I trembled when I saw him holding them so close to the\r\ncandle, and poring so intently over the seeming blanks; but still, I\r\ntrusted, he would not be able to make out these dim traces to his own\r\nsatisfaction. I was mistaken, however. Having ended his scrutiny, he\r\nquietly remarked,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive the backs of young ladies\xe2\x80\x99 drawings, like\r\nthe postscripts of their letters, are the most important and\r\ninteresting part of the concern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, leaning back in his chair, he reflected a few minutes in silence,\r\ncomplacently smiling to himself, and while I was concocting some\r\ncutting speech wherewith to check his gratification, he rose, and\r\npassing over to where Annabella Wilmot sat vehemently coquetting with\r\nLord Lowborough, seated himself on the sofa beside her, and attached\r\nhimself to her for the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9che despises me, because he knows I love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the reflection made me so miserable I knew not what to do. Milicent\r\ncame and began to admire my drawings, and make remarks upon them; but I\r\ncould not talk to her\xe2\x80\x94I could talk to no one, and, upon the\r\nintroduction of tea, I took advantage of the open door and the slight\r\ndiversion caused by its entrance to slip out\xe2\x80\x94for I was sure I could not\r\ntake any\xe2\x80\x94and take refuge in the library. My aunt sent Thomas in quest\r\nof me, to ask if I were not coming to tea; but I bade him say I should\r\nnot take any to-night, and, happily, she was too much occupied with her\r\nguests to make any further inquiries at the time.\r\n\r\nAs most of the company had travelled far that day, they retired early\r\nto rest; and having heard them all, as I thought, go up-stairs, I\r\nventured out, to get my candlestick from the drawing-room sideboard.\r\nBut Mr. Huntingdon had lingered behind the rest. He was just at the\r\nfoot of the stairs when I opened the door, and hearing my step in the\r\nhall\xe2\x80\x94though I could hardly hear it myself\xe2\x80\x94he instantly turned back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you run away from us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mr. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, coldly, not choosing to answer\r\nthe question. And I turned away to enter the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll shake hands, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, placing himself in the\r\ndoorway before me. And he seized my hand and held it, much against my\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, Mr. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get a candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe candle will keep,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he.\r\n\r\nI made a desperate effort to free my hand from his grasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you in such a hurry to leave me, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a smile\r\nof the most provoking self-sufficiency. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t hate me, you\r\n_know_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do\xe2\x80\x94at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot you. It is Annabella Wilmot you hate, not me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to do with Annabella Wilmot,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, burning with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ have, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he, with peculiar emphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is nothing to me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ it nothing to you, Helen? Will you swear it? Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo I won\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Huntingdon! and I _will_ go,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, not knowing\r\nwhether to laugh, or to cry, or to break out into a tempest of fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, then, you vixen!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; but the instant he released my hand he\r\nhad the audacity to put his arm round my neck, and kiss me.\r\n\r\nTrembling with anger and agitation, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what besides, I\r\nbroke away, and got my candle, and rushed up-stairs to my room. He\r\nwould not have done so but for that hateful picture. And there he had\r\nit still in his possession, an eternal monument to his pride and my\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nIt was but little sleep I got that night, and in the morning I rose\r\nperplexed and troubled with the thoughts of meeting him at breakfast. I\r\nknew not how it was to be done. An assumption of dignified, cold\r\nindifference would hardly do, after what he knew of my devotion\xe2\x80\x94to his\r\nface, at least. Yet something must be done to check his presumption\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwould not submit to be tyrannised over by those bright, laughing eyes.\r\nAnd, accordingly, I received his cheerful morning salutation as calmly\r\nand coldly as my aunt could have wished, and defeated with brief\r\nanswers his one or two attempts to draw me into conversation, while I\r\ncomported myself with unusual cheerfulness and complaisance towards\r\nevery other member of the party, especially Annabella Wilmot, and even\r\nher uncle and Mr. Boarham were treated with an extra amount of civility\r\non the occasion, not from any motives of coquetry, but just to show him\r\nthat my particular coolness and reserve arose from no general\r\nill-humour or depression of spirits.\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, to be repelled by such acting as this. He did not\r\ntalk much to me, but when he did speak it was with a degree of freedom\r\nand openness, and _kindliness_ too, that plainly seemed to intimate he\r\nknew his words were music to my ears; and when his looks met mine it\r\nwas with a smile\xe2\x80\x94presumptuous, it might be\xe2\x80\x94but oh! so sweet, so bright,\r\nso genial, that I could not possibly retain my anger; every vestige of\r\ndispleasure soon melted away beneath it like morning clouds before the\r\nsummer sun.\r\n\r\nSoon after breakfast all the gentlemen save one, with boyish eagerness,\r\nset out on their expedition against the hapless partridges; my uncle\r\nand Mr. Wilmot on their shooting ponies, Mr. Huntingdon and Lord\r\nLowborough on their legs: the one exception being Mr. Boarham, who, in\r\nconsideration of the rain that had fallen during the night, thought it\r\nprudent to remain behind a little and join them in a while when the sun\r\nhad dried the grass. And he favoured us all with a long and minute\r\ndisquisition upon the evils and dangers attendant upon damp feet,\r\ndelivered with the most imperturbable gravity, amid the jeers and\r\nlaughter of Mr. Huntingdon and my uncle, who, leaving the prudent\r\nsportsman to entertain the ladies with his medical discussions, sallied\r\nforth with their guns, bending their steps to the stables first, to\r\nhave a look at the horses and let out the dogs.\r\n\r\nNot desirous of sharing Mr. Boarham\xe2\x80\x99s company for the whole of the\r\nmorning, I betook myself to the library, and there brought forth my\r\neasel and began to paint. The easel and the painting apparatus would\r\nserve as an excuse for abandoning the drawing-room if my aunt should\r\ncome to complain of the desertion, and besides I wanted to finish the\r\npicture. It was one I had taken great pains with, and I intended it to\r\nbe my masterpiece, though it was somewhat presumptuous in the design.\r\nBy the bright azure of the sky, and by the warm and brilliant lights\r\nand deep long shadows, I had endeavoured to convey the idea of a sunny\r\nmorning. I had ventured to give more of the bright verdure of spring or\r\nearly summer to the grass and foliage than is commonly attempted in\r\npainting. The scene represented was an open glade in a wood. A group of\r\ndark Scotch firs was introduced in the middle distance to relieve the\r\nprevailing freshness of the rest; but in the foreground was part of the\r\ngnarled trunk and of the spreading boughs of a large forest-tree, whose\r\nfoliage was of a brilliant golden green\xe2\x80\x94not golden from autumnal\r\nmellowness, but from the sunshine and the very immaturity of the scarce\r\nexpanded leaves. Upon this bough, that stood out in bold relief against\r\nthe sombre firs, were seated an amorous pair of turtle doves, whose\r\nsoft sad-coloured plumage afforded a contrast of another nature; and\r\nbeneath it a young girl was kneeling on the daisy-spangled turf, with\r\nhead thrown back and masses of fair hair falling on her shoulders, her\r\nhands clasped, lips parted, and eyes intently gazing upward in pleased\r\nyet earnest contemplation of those feathered lovers\xe2\x80\x94too deeply absorbed\r\nin each other to notice her.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely settled to my work, which, however, wanted but a few\r\ntouches to the finishing, when the sportsmen passed the window on their\r\nreturn from the stables. It was partly open, and Mr. Huntingdon must\r\nhave seen me as he went by, for in half a minute he came back, and\r\nsetting his gun against the wall, threw up the sash and sprang in, and\r\nset himself before my picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery pretty, i\xe2\x80\x99faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after attentively regarding it for a\r\nfew seconds; \xe2\x80\x9cand a very fitting study for a young lady. Spring just\r\nopening into summer\xe2\x80\x94morning just approaching noon\xe2\x80\x94girlhood just\r\nripening into womanhood, and hope just verging on fruition. She\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsweet creature! but why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you make her black hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought light hair would suit her better. You see I have made her\r\nblue-eyed and plump, and fair and rosy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word\xe2\x80\x94a very Hebe! I should fall in love with her if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe artist before me. Sweet innocent! she\xe2\x80\x99s thinking there will come a\r\ntime when she will be wooed and won like that pretty hen-dove by as\r\nfond and fervent a lover; and she\xe2\x80\x99s thinking how pleasant it will be,\r\nand how tender and faithful he will find her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested I, \xe2\x80\x9chow tender and faithful she shall find\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, for there is no limit to the wild extravagance of Hope\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimaginings at such an age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call _that_, then, one of her wild, extravagant delusions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; my heart tells me it is not. I might have thought so once, but\r\nnow, I say, give me the girl I love, and I will swear eternal constancy\r\nto her and her alone, through summer and winter, through youth and age,\r\nand life and death! if age and death _must_ come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke this in such serious earnest that my heart bounded with\r\ndelight; but the minute after he changed his tone, and asked, with a\r\nsignificant smile, if I had \xe2\x80\x9cany more portraits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, reddening with confusion and wrath.\r\n\r\nBut my portfolio was on the table: he took it up, and coolly sat down\r\nto examine its contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Huntingdon, those are my unfinished sketches,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nnever let any one see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I placed my hand on the portfolio to wrest it from him, but he\r\nmaintained his hold, assuring me that he \xe2\x80\x9cliked unfinished sketches of\r\nall things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hate them to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t let you have it,\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me have its bowels then,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and just as I wrenched the\r\nportfolio from his hand, he deftly abstracted the greater part of its\r\ncontents, and after turning them over a moment he cried out,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBless my\r\nstars, here\xe2\x80\x99s another;\xe2\x80\x9d and slipped a small oval of ivory paper into\r\nhis waistcoat pocket\xe2\x80\x94a complete miniature portrait that I had sketched\r\nwith such tolerable success as to be induced to colour it with great\r\npains and care. But I was determined he should not keep it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, \xe2\x80\x9cI _insist_ upon having that back! It is\r\nmine, and you have no _right_ to take it. Give it me directly\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever forgive you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the more vehemently I insisted, the more he aggravated my distress\r\nby his insulting, gleeful laugh. At length, however, he restored it to\r\nme, saying,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, since you value it so much, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not deprive\r\nyou of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo show him how I valued it, I tore it in two and threw it into the\r\nfire. He was not prepared for this. His merriment suddenly ceasing, he\r\nstared in mute amazement at the consuming treasure; and then, with a\r\ncareless \xe2\x80\x9cHumph! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and shoot now,\xe2\x80\x9d he turned on his heel and\r\nvacated the apartment by the window as he came, and setting on his hat\r\nwith an air, took up his gun and walked away, whistling as he went\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nleaving me not too much agitated to finish my picture, for I was glad,\r\nat the moment, that I had vexed him.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the drawing-room, I found Mr. Boarham had ventured\r\nto follow his comrades to the field; and shortly after lunch, to which\r\nthey did not think of returning, I volunteered to accompany the ladies\r\nin a walk, and show Annabella and Milicent the beauties of the country.\r\nWe took a long ramble, and re-entered the park just as the sportsmen\r\nwere returning from their expedition. Toil-spent and travel-stained,\r\nthe main body of them crossed over the grass to avoid us, but Mr.\r\nHuntingdon, all spattered and splashed as he was, and stained with the\r\nblood of his prey\xe2\x80\x94to the no small offence of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s strict sense of\r\npropriety\xe2\x80\x94came out of his way to meet us, with cheerful smiles and\r\nwords for all but me, and placing himself between Annabella Wilmot and\r\nmyself, walked up the road and began to relate the various exploits and\r\ndisasters of the day, in a manner that would have convulsed me with\r\nlaughter if I had been on good terms with him; but he addressed himself\r\nentirely to Annabella, and I, of course, left all the laughter and all\r\nthe badinage to her, and affecting the utmost indifference to whatever\r\npassed between them, walked along a few paces apart, and looking every\r\nway but theirs, while my aunt and Milicent went before, linked arm in\r\narm and gravely discoursing together. At length Mr. Huntingdon turned\r\nto me, and addressing me in a confidential whisper, said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, why\r\ndid you burn my picture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wished to destroy it,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, with an asperity it is\r\nuseless now to lament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very good!\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; \xe2\x80\x9cif _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t value me, I must turn\r\nto somebody that will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought it was partly in jest\xe2\x80\x94a half-playful mixture of mock\r\nresignation and pretended indifference: but immediately he resumed his\r\nplace beside Miss Wilmot, and from that hour to this\xe2\x80\x94during all that\r\nevening, and all the next day, and the next, and the next, and all this\r\nmorning (the 22nd), he has never given me one kind word or one pleasant\r\nlook\xe2\x80\x94never spoken to me, but from pure necessity\xe2\x80\x94never glanced towards\r\nme but with a cold, unfriendly look I thought him quite incapable of\r\nassuming.\r\n\r\nMy aunt observes the change, and though she has not inquired the cause\r\nor made any remark to me on the subject, I see it gives her pleasure.\r\nMiss Wilmot observes it, too, and triumphantly ascribes it to her own\r\nsuperior charms and blandishments; but I am truly miserable\xe2\x80\x94more so\r\nthan I like to acknowledge to myself. Pride refuses to aid me. It has\r\nbrought me into the scrape, and will not help me out of it.\r\n\r\nHe meant no harm\xe2\x80\x94it was only his joyous, playful spirit; and I, by my\r\nacrimonious resentment\xe2\x80\x94so serious, so disproportioned to the\r\noffence\xe2\x80\x94have so wounded his feelings, so deeply offended him, that I\r\nfear he will never forgive me\xe2\x80\x94and all for a mere jest! He thinks I\r\ndislike him, and he must continue to think so. I must lose him for\r\never, and Annabella may win him, and triumph as she will.\r\n\r\nBut it is not my loss nor her triumph that I deplore so greatly as the\r\nwreck of my fond hopes for his advantage, and her unworthiness of his\r\naffection, and the injury he will do himself by trusting his happiness\r\nto her. _She_ does not love him: she thinks only of herself. She cannot\r\nappreciate the good that is in him: she will neither see it, nor value\r\nit, nor cherish it. She will neither deplore his faults nor attempt\r\ntheir amendment, but rather aggravate them by her own. And I doubt\r\nwhether she will not deceive him after all. I see she is playing double\r\nbetween him and Lord Lowborough, and while she amuses herself with the\r\nlively Huntingdon, she tries her utmost to enslave his moody friend;\r\nand should she succeed in bringing both to her feet, the fascinating\r\ncommoner will have but little chance against the lordly peer. If he\r\nobserves her artful by-play, it gives him no uneasiness, but rather\r\nadds new zest to his diversion by opposing a stimulating check to his\r\notherwise too easy conquest.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Wilmot and Boarham have severally taken occasion by his neglect\r\nof me to renew their advances; and if I were like Annabella and some\r\nothers I should take advantage of their perseverance to endeavour to\r\npique him into a revival of affection; but, justice and honesty apart,\r\nI could not _bear_ to do it. I am annoyed enough by their present\r\npersecutions without encouraging them further; and even if I did it\r\nwould have precious little effect upon him. He sees me suffering under\r\nthe condescending attentions and prosaic discourses of the one, and the\r\nrepulsive obtrusions of the other, without so much as a shadow of\r\ncommiseration for me, or resentment against my tormentors. He never\r\ncould have loved me, or he would not have resigned me so willingly, and\r\nhe would not go on talking to everybody else so cheerfully as he\r\ndoes\xe2\x80\x94laughing and jesting with Lord Lowborough and my uncle, teasing\r\nMilicent Hargrave, and flirting with Annabella Wilmot\xe2\x80\x94as if nothing\r\nwere on his mind. Oh! why can\xe2\x80\x99t I hate him? I must be infatuated, or I\r\nshould scorn to regret him as I do. But I must rally all the powers I\r\nhave remaining, and try to tear him from my heart. There goes the\r\ndinner-bell, and here comes my aunt to scold me for sitting here at my\r\ndesk all day, instead of staying with the company: wish the company\r\nwere\xe2\x80\x94gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-Second: Night.\xe2\x80\x94What have I done? and what will be the end of it?\r\nI cannot calmly reflect upon it; I cannot sleep. I must have recourse\r\nto my diary again; I will commit it to paper to-night, and see what I\r\nshall think of it to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI went down to dinner resolving to be cheerful and well-conducted, and\r\nkept my resolution very creditably, considering how my head ached and\r\nhow internally wretched I felt. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is come over me of\r\nlate; my very energies, both mental and physical, must be strangely\r\nimpaired, or I should not have acted so weakly in many respects as I\r\nhave done; but I have not been well this last day or two. I suppose it\r\nis with sleeping and eating so little, and thinking so much, and being\r\nso continually out of humour. But to return. I was exerting myself to\r\nsing and play for the amusement, and at the request, of my aunt and\r\nMilicent, before the gentlemen came into the drawing-room (Miss Wilmot\r\nnever likes to waste her musical efforts on ladies\xe2\x80\x99 ears alone).\r\nMilicent had asked for a little Scotch song, and I was just in the\r\nmiddle of it when they entered. The first thing Mr. Huntingdon did was\r\nto walk up to Annabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Wilmot, won\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ give us some music to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo now! I know you will, when I tell you that I have been hungering\r\nand thirsting all day for the sound of your voice. Come! the piano\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvacant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, for I had quitted it immediately upon hearing his petition. Had\r\nI been endowed with a proper degree of self-possession, I should have\r\nturned to the lady myself, and cheerfully joined my entreaties to his,\r\nwhereby I should have disappointed his expectations, if the affront had\r\nbeen purposely given, or made him sensible of the wrong, if it had only\r\narisen from thoughtlessness; but I felt it too deeply to do anything\r\nbut rise from the music-stool, and throw myself back on the sofa,\r\nsuppressing with difficulty the audible expression of the bitterness I\r\nfelt within. I knew Annabella\xe2\x80\x99s musical talents were superior to mine,\r\nbut that was no reason why I should be treated as a perfect nonentity.\r\nThe time and the manner of his asking her appeared like a gratuitous\r\ninsult to me; and I could have wept with pure vexation.\r\n\r\nMeantime, she exultingly seated herself at the piano, and favoured him\r\nwith two of his favourite songs, in such superior style that even I\r\nsoon lost my anger in admiration, and listened with a sort of gloomy\r\npleasure to the skilful modulations of her full-toned and powerful\r\nvoice, so judiciously aided by her rounded and spirited touch; and\r\nwhile my ears drank in the sound, my eyes rested on the face of her\r\nprincipal auditor, and derived an equal or superior delight from the\r\ncontemplation of his speaking countenance, as he stood beside her\xe2\x80\x94that\r\neye and brow lighted up with keen enthusiasm, and that sweet smile\r\npassing and appearing like gleams of sunshine on an April day. No\r\nwonder he should hunger and thirst to hear her sing. I now forgave him\r\nfrom my heart his reckless slight of me, and I felt ashamed at my\r\npettish resentment of such a trifle\xe2\x80\x94ashamed too of those bitter envious\r\npangs that gnawed my inmost heart, in spite of all this admiration and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, playfully running her fingers over the keys when\r\nshe had concluded the second song. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I give you next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut in saying this she looked back at Lord Lowborough, who was standing\r\na little behind, leaning against the back of a chair, an attentive\r\nlistener, too, experiencing, to judge by his countenance, much the same\r\nfeelings of mingled pleasure and sadness as I did. But the look she\r\ngave him plainly said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you choose for me now: I have done enough\r\nfor him, and will gladly exert myself to gratify you;\xe2\x80\x9d and thus\r\nencouraged, his lordship came forward, and turning over the music,\r\npresently set before her a little song that I had noticed before, and\r\nread more than once, with an interest arising from the circumstance of\r\nmy connecting it in my mind with the reigning tyrant of my thoughts.\r\nAnd now, with my nerves already excited and half unstrung, I could not\r\nhear those words so sweetly warbled forth without some symptoms of\r\nemotion I was not able to suppress. Tears rose unbidden to my eyes, and\r\nI buried my face in the sofa-pillow that they might flow unseen while I\r\nlistened. The air was simple, sweet, and sad. It is still running in my\r\nhead, and so are the words:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFarewell to thee! but not farewell\r\n    To all my fondest thoughts of thee:\r\nWithin my heart they still shall dwell;\r\n    And they shall cheer and comfort me.\r\n\r\nO beautiful, and full of grace!\r\n    If thou hadst never met mine eye,\r\nI had not dreamed a living face\r\n    Could fancied charms so far outvie.\r\n\r\nIf I may ne\xe2\x80\x99er behold again\r\n    That form and face so dear to me,\r\nNor hear thy voice, still would I fain\r\n    Preserve, for aye, their memory.\r\n\r\nThat voice, the magic of whose tone\r\n    Can wake an echo in my breast,\r\nCreating feelings that, alone,\r\n    Can make my tranced spirit blest.\r\n\r\nThat laughing eye, whose sunny beam\r\n    My memory would not cherish less;\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAnd oh, that smile! I whose joyous gleam\r\n    No mortal languish can express.\r\n\r\nAdieu! but let me cherish, still,\r\n    The hope with which I cannot part.\r\nContempt may wound, and coldness chill,\r\n    But still it lingers in my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd who can tell but Heaven, at last,\r\n    May answer all my thousand prayers,\r\nAnd bid the future pay the past\r\n    With joy for anguish, smiles for tears.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it ceased, I longed for nothing so much as to be out of the room.\r\nThe sofa was not far from the door, but I did not dare to raise my\r\nhead, for I knew Mr. Huntingdon was standing near me, and I knew by the\r\nsound of his voice, as he spoke in answer to some remark of Lord\r\nLowborough\xe2\x80\x99s, that his face was turned towards me. Perhaps a\r\nhalf-suppressed sob had caught his ear, and caused him to look\r\nround\xe2\x80\x94heaven forbid! But with a violent effort, I checked all further\r\nsigns of weakness, dried my tears, and, when I thought he had turned\r\naway again, rose, and instantly left the apartment, taking refuge in my\r\nfavourite resort, the library.\r\n\r\nThere was no light there but the faint red glow of the neglected\r\nfire;\xe2\x80\x94but I did not want a light; I only wanted to indulge my thoughts,\r\nunnoticed and undisturbed; and sitting down on a low stool before the\r\neasy-chair, I sunk my head upon its cushioned seat, and thought, and\r\nthought, until the tears gushed out again, and I wept like any child.\r\nPresently, however, the door was gently opened and someone entered the\r\nroom. I trusted it was only a servant, and did not stir. The door was\r\nclosed again\xe2\x80\x94but I was not alone; a hand gently touched my shoulder,\r\nand a voice said, softly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not answer at the moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must, and shall tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d was added, more vehemently, and the\r\nspeaker threw himself on his knees beside me on the rug, and forcibly\r\npossessed himself of my hand; but I hastily caught it away, and\r\nreplied,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing to you, Mr. Huntingdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure it is nothing to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he returned; \xe2\x80\x9ccan you swear that\r\nyou were not thinking of me while you wept?\xe2\x80\x9d This was unendurable. I\r\nmade an effort to rise, but he was kneeling on my dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know,\xe2\x80\x94because if you were, I have\r\nsomething to say to you,\xe2\x80\x94and if not, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo then!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried; but, fearing he would obey too well, and never come\r\nagain, I hastily added\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOr say what you have to say, and have done with\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut which?\xe2\x80\x9d said he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor I shall only say it if you really were\r\nthinking of me. So tell me, Helen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re excessively impertinent, Mr. Huntingdon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all\xe2\x80\x94too pertinent, you mean. So you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x94Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nspare your woman\xe2\x80\x99s pride, and, construing your silence into \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake it for granted that I was the subject of your thoughts, and the\r\ncause of your affliction\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you deny it, I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you my secret,\xe2\x80\x9d threatened he; and I did\r\nnot interrupt him again, or even attempt to repulse him: though he had\r\ntaken my hand once more, and half embraced me with his other arm, I was\r\nscarcely conscious of it at the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is this,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he: \xe2\x80\x9cthat Annabella Wilmot, in comparison with\r\nyou, is like a flaunting peony compared with a sweet, wild rosebud\r\ngemmed with dew\xe2\x80\x94and I love you to distraction!\xe2\x80\x94Now, tell me if that\r\nintelligence gives you any pleasure. Silence again? That means yes.\r\nThen let me add, that I cannot live without you, and if you answer No\r\nto this last question, you will drive me mad.\xe2\x80\x94Will you bestow yourself\r\nupon me?\xe2\x80\x94you will!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, nearly squeezing me to death in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, struggling to free myself from him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou must ask\r\nmy uncle and aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure of that\xe2\x80\x94my aunt dislikes you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t, Helen\xe2\x80\x94say you love me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you _would_ go!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, this instant,\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only say you love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I do,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. And again he caught me in his arms, and\r\nsmothered me with kisses.\r\n\r\nAt that moment my aunt opened wide the door, and stood before us,\r\ncandle in hand, in shocked and horrified amazement, gazing alternately\r\nat Mr. Huntingdon and me\xe2\x80\x94for we had both started up, and now stood wide\r\nenough asunder. But _his_ confusion was only for a moment. Rallying in\r\nan instant, with the most enviable assurance, he began,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI beg ten\r\nthousand pardons, Mrs. Maxwell! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too severe upon me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nasking your sweet niece to take me for better, for worse; and she, like\r\na good girl, informs me she cannot think of it without her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s consent. So let me implore you not to condemn me to eternal\r\nwretchedness: if _you_ favour my cause, I am safe; for Mr. Maxwell, I\r\nam certain, can refuse you nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk of this to-morrow, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt, coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nsubject that demands mature and serious deliberation. At present, you\r\nhad better return to the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded he, \xe2\x80\x9clet me commend my cause to your most\r\nindulgent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indulgence for you, Mr. Huntingdon, must come between me and the\r\nconsideration of my niece\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, true! I know she is an angel, and I am a presumptuous dog to dream\r\nof possessing such a treasure; but, nevertheless, I would sooner die\r\nthan relinquish her in favour of the best man that ever went to\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x94and as for her happiness, I would sacrifice my body and soul\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBody and _soul_, Mr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x94sacrifice your _soul?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I would lay down life\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not be required to lay it down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would spend it, then\xe2\x80\x94devote my life\xe2\x80\x94and all its powers to the\r\npromotion and preservation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother time, sir, we will talk of this\xe2\x80\x94and I should have felt\r\ndisposed to judge more favourably of your pretensions, if you too had\r\nchosen another time and place, and let me add\xe2\x80\x94another _manner_ for your\r\ndeclaration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see, Mrs. Maxwell,\xe2\x80\x9d he began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with dignity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe company are inquiring for\r\nyou in the other room.\xe2\x80\x9d And she turned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _you_ must plead for me, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and at length withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better retire to your room, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill discuss this matter with you, too, to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I am not angry,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI am _surprised_. If it is\r\ntrue that you told him you could not accept his offer without our\r\nconsent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ true,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how could you permit\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, bursting into tears. They were not\r\naltogether the tears of sorrow, or of fear for her displeasure, but\r\nrather the outbreak of the general tumultuous excitement of my\r\nfeelings. But my good aunt was touched at my agitation. In a softer\r\ntone, she repeated her recommendation to retire, and, gently kissing my\r\nforehead, bade me good-night, and put her candle in my hand; and I\r\nwent; but my brain worked so, I could not think of sleeping. I feel\r\ncalmer now that I have written all this; and I will go to bed, and try\r\nto win tired nature\xe2\x80\x99s sweet restorer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 24th.\xe2\x80\x94In the morning I rose, light and cheerful\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nintensely happy. The hovering cloud cast over me by my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s views,\r\nand by the fear of not obtaining her consent, was lost in the bright\r\neffulgence of my own hopes, and the too delightful consciousness of\r\nrequited love. It was a splendid morning; and I went out to enjoy it,\r\nin a quiet ramble, in company with my own blissful thoughts. The dew\r\nwas on the grass, and ten thousand gossamers were waving in the breeze;\r\nthe happy red-breast was pouring out its little soul in song, and my\r\nheart overflowed with silent hymns of gratitude and praise to heaven.\r\n\r\nBut I had not wandered far before my solitude was interrupted by the\r\nonly person that could have disturbed my musings, at that moment,\r\nwithout being looked upon as an unwelcome intruder: Mr. Huntingdon came\r\nsuddenly upon me. So unexpected was the apparition, that I might have\r\nthought it the creation of an over-excited imagination, had the sense\r\nof sight alone borne witness to his presence; but immediately I felt\r\nhis strong arm round my waist and his warm kiss on my cheek, while his\r\nkeen and gleeful salutation, \xe2\x80\x9cMy own Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d was ringing in my ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yours yet!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, hastily swerving aside from this too\r\npresumptuous greeting. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember my guardians. You will not easily\r\nobtain my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s consent. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see she is prejudiced against you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, dearest; and you must tell me why, that I may best know how to\r\ncombat her objections. I suppose she thinks I am a prodigal,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nhe, observing that I was unwilling to reply, \xe2\x80\x9cand concludes that I\r\nshall have but little worldly goods wherewith to endow my better half?\r\nIf so, you must tell her that my property is mostly entailed, and I\r\ncannot get rid of it. There may be a few mortgages on the rest\xe2\x80\x94a few\r\ntrifling debts and incumbrances here and there, but nothing to speak\r\nof; and though I acknowledge I am not so rich as I might be\xe2\x80\x94or have\r\nbeen\xe2\x80\x94still, I think, we could manage pretty comfortably on what\xe2\x80\x99s left.\r\nMy father, you know, was something of a miser, and in his latter days\r\nespecially saw no pleasure in life but to amass riches; and so it is no\r\nwonder that his son should make it his chief delight to spend them,\r\nwhich was accordingly the case, until my acquaintance with you, dear\r\nHelen, taught me other views and nobler aims. And the very idea of\r\nhaving you to care for under my roof would force me to moderate my\r\nexpenses and live like a Christian\xe2\x80\x94not to speak of all the prudence and\r\nvirtue you would instil into my mind by your wise counsels and sweet,\r\nattractive goodness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cit is not money my aunt thinks about.\r\nShe knows better than to value worldly wealth above its price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wishes me to\xe2\x80\x94to marry none but a really good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, a man of \xe2\x80\x98decided piety\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x94ahem!\xe2\x80\x94Well, come, I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage that\r\ntoo! It\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday to-day, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to church morning,\r\nafternoon, and evening, and comport myself in such a godly sort that\r\nshe shall regard me with admiration and sisterly love, as a brand\r\nplucked from the burning. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come home sighing like a furnace, and\r\nfull of the savour and unction of dear Mr. Blatant\xe2\x80\x99s discourse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Leighton,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Leighton a \xe2\x80\x98sweet preacher,\xe2\x80\x99 Helen\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x98dear, delightful,\r\nheavenly-minded man\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a _good_ man, Mr. Huntingdon. I wish I could say half as much\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I forgot, you are a saint, too. I crave your pardon, dearest\xe2\x80\x94but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t call me Mr. Huntingdon; my name is Arthur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call you nothing\xe2\x80\x94for I\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothing at all to do with you if\r\nyou talk in that way any more. If you really mean to deceive my aunt as\r\nyou say, you are very wicked; and if not, you are very wrong to jest on\r\nsuch a subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stand corrected,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, concluding his laugh with a sorrowful\r\nsigh. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he, after a momentary pause, \xe2\x80\x9clet us talk about\r\nsomething else. And come nearer to me, Helen, and take my arm; and then\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you alone. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be quiet while I see you walking there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI complied; but said we must soon return to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will be down to breakfast yet, for long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke of your guardians just now, Helen, but is not your father\r\nstill living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I always look upon my uncle and aunt as my guardians, for\r\nthey are so in deed, though not in name. My father has entirely given\r\nme up to their care. I have never seen him since dear mamma died, when\r\nI was a very little girl, and my aunt, at her request, offered to take\r\ncharge of me, and took me away to Staningley, where I have remained\r\never since; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he would object to anything for me that\r\nshe thought proper to sanction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would he sanction anything to which she thought proper to object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he cares enough about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very much to blame\xe2\x80\x94but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what an angel he has for\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x94which is all the better for me, as, if he did, he would\r\nnot be willing to part with such a treasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you _know_ I am not an\r\nheiress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe protested he had never given it a thought, and begged I would not\r\ndisturb his present enjoyment by the mention of such uninteresting\r\nsubjects. I was glad of this proof of disinterested affection; for\r\nAnnabella Wilmot is the probable heiress to all her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s wealth, in\r\naddition to her late father\xe2\x80\x99s property, which she has already in\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nI now insisted upon retracing our steps to the house; but we walked\r\nslowly, and went on talking as we proceeded. I need not repeat all we\r\nsaid: let me rather refer to what passed between my aunt and me, after\r\nbreakfast, when Mr. Huntingdon called my uncle aside, no doubt to make\r\nhis proposals, and she beckoned me into another room, where she once\r\nmore commenced a solemn remonstrance, which, however, entirely failed\r\nto convince me that her view of the case was preferable to my own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou judge him uncharitably, aunt, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cHis very friends\r\nare not half so bad as you represent them. There is Walter Hargrave,\r\nMilicent\xe2\x80\x99s brother, for one: he is but a little lower than the angels,\r\nif half she says of him is true. She is continually talking to me about\r\nhim, and lauding his many virtues to the skies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will form a very inadequate estimate of a man\xe2\x80\x99s character,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied she, \xe2\x80\x9cif you judge by what a fond sister says of him. The worst\r\nof them generally know how to hide their misdeeds from their sisters\xe2\x80\x99\r\neyes, and their mother\xe2\x80\x99s, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is Lord Lowborough,\xe2\x80\x9d continued I, \xe2\x80\x9cquite a decent man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you so? Lord Lowborough is a _desperate_ man. He has\r\ndissipated his fortune in gambling and other things, and is now seeking\r\nan heiress to retrieve it. I told Miss Wilmot so; but you\xe2\x80\x99re all alike:\r\nshe haughtily answered she was very much obliged to me, but she\r\nbelieved _she_ knew when a man was seeking her for her fortune, and\r\nwhen for herself; she flattered herself she had had experience enough\r\nin those matters to be justified in trusting to her own judgment\xe2\x80\x94and as\r\nfor his lordship\xe2\x80\x99s lack of fortune, she cared nothing about that, as\r\nshe hoped her own would suffice for both; and as for his wildness, she\r\nsupposed he was no worse than others\xe2\x80\x94besides, he was reformed now. Yes,\r\nthey can all play the hypocrite when they want to take in a fond,\r\nmisguided woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s about as good as she is,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when Mr.\r\nHuntingdon is married, he won\xe2\x80\x99t have many opportunities of consorting\r\nwith his bachelor friends;\xe2\x80\x94and the worse they are, the more I long to\r\ndeliver him from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, my dear; and the worse _he_ is, I suppose, the more you\r\nlong to deliver him from himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, provided he is not incorrigible\xe2\x80\x94that is, the more I long to\r\ndeliver him from his faults\xe2\x80\x94to give him an opportunity of shaking off\r\nthe adventitious evil got from contact with others worse than himself,\r\nand shining out in the unclouded light of his own genuine goodness\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ndo my utmost to help his better self against his worse, and make him\r\nwhat he would have been if he had not, from the beginning, had a bad,\r\nselfish, miserly father, who, to gratify his own sordid passions,\r\nrestricted him in the most innocent enjoyments of childhood and youth,\r\nand so disgusted him with every kind of restraint;\xe2\x80\x94and a foolish mother\r\nwho indulged him to the top of his bent, deceiving her husband for him,\r\nand doing her utmost to encourage those germs of folly and vice it was\r\nher duty to suppress,\xe2\x80\x94and then, such a set of companions as you\r\nrepresent his friends to be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor man!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, sarcastically, \xe2\x80\x9chis kind have greatly wronged\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand they shall wrong him no more\xe2\x80\x94his wife shall\r\nundo what his mother did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI must say, Helen, I thought\r\nbetter of your judgment than this\xe2\x80\x94and your taste too. How you can love\r\nsuch a man I cannot tell, or what pleasure you can find in his company;\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x98what fellowship hath light with darkness; or he that believeth\r\nwith an infidel?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not an infidel;\xe2\x80\x94and I am not light, and he is not darkness; his\r\nworst and only vice is thoughtlessness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thoughtlessness,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued my aunt, \xe2\x80\x9cmay lead to every crime, and\r\nwill but poorly excuse our errors in the sight of God. Mr. Huntingdon,\r\nI suppose, is not without the common faculties of men: he is not so\r\nlight-headed as to be irresponsible: his Maker has endowed him with\r\nreason and conscience as well as the rest of us; the Scriptures are\r\nopen to him as well as to others;\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x98if he hear not them, neither\r\nwill he hear though one rose from the dead.\xe2\x80\x99 And remember, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued she, solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98the wicked shall be turned into hell, and\r\nthey that _forget_ God!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d And suppose, even, that he should continue to\r\nlove you, and you him, and that you should pass through life together\r\nwith tolerable comfort\xe2\x80\x94how will it be in the end, when you see\r\nyourselves parted for ever; you, perhaps, taken into eternal bliss, and\r\nhe cast into the lake that burneth with unquenchable fire\xe2\x80\x94there for\r\never to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for ever,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98only till he has paid the uttermost\r\nfarthing;\xe2\x80\x99 for \xe2\x80\x98if any man\xe2\x80\x99s work abide not the fire, he shall suffer\r\nloss, yet himself shall be saved, but so as by fire;\xe2\x80\x99 and He that \xe2\x80\x98is\r\nable to subdue all things to Himself will have all men to be saved,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand \xe2\x80\x98will, in the fulness of time, gather together in one all things in\r\nChrist Jesus, who tasted death for every man, and in whom God will\r\nreconcile all things to Himself, whether they be things in earth or\r\nthings in heaven.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Helen! where did you learn all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Bible, aunt. I have searched it through, and found nearly\r\nthirty passages, all tending to support the same theory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is _that_ the use you make of your Bible? And did you find no\r\npassages tending to prove the danger and the falsity of such a belief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: I found, indeed, some passages that, taken by themselves, might\r\nseem to contradict that opinion; but they will all bear a different\r\nconstruction to that which is commonly given, and in most the only\r\ndifficulty is in the word which we translate \xe2\x80\x98everlasting\xe2\x80\x99 or\r\n\xe2\x80\x98eternal.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the Greek, but I believe it strictly means for\r\nages, and might signify either endless or long-enduring. And as for the\r\ndanger of the belief, I would not publish it abroad if I thought any\r\npoor wretch would be likely to presume upon it to his own destruction,\r\nbut it is a glorious thought to cherish in one\xe2\x80\x99s own heart, and I would\r\nnot part with it for all the world can give!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere our conference ended, for it was now high time to prepare for\r\nchurch. Every one attended the morning service, except my uncle, who\r\nhardly ever goes, and Mr. Wilmot, who stayed at home with him to enjoy\r\na quiet game of cribbage. In the afternoon Miss Wilmot and Lord\r\nLowborough likewise excused themselves from attending; but Mr.\r\nHuntingdon vouchsafed to accompany us again. Whether it was to\r\ningratiate himself with my aunt I cannot tell, but, if so, he certainly\r\nshould have behaved better. I must confess, I did not like his conduct\r\nduring service at all. Holding his prayer-book upside down, or open at\r\nany place but the right, he did nothing but stare about him, unless he\r\nhappened to catch my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s eye or mine, and then he would drop his own\r\non his book, with a puritanical air of mock solemnity that would have\r\nbeen ludicrous, if it had not been too provoking. Once, during the\r\nsermon, after attentively regarding Mr. Leighton for a few minutes, he\r\nsuddenly produced his gold pencil-case and snatched up a Bible.\r\nPerceiving that I observed the movement, he whispered that he was going\r\nto make a note of the sermon; but instead of that, as I sat next him, I\r\ncould not help seeing that he was making a caricature of the preacher,\r\ngiving to the respectable, pious, elderly gentleman, the air and aspect\r\nof a most absurd old hypocrite. And yet, upon his return, he talked to\r\nmy aunt about the sermon with a degree of modest, serious\r\ndiscrimination that tempted me to believe he had really attended to and\r\nprofited by the discourse.\r\n\r\nJust before dinner my uncle called me into the library for the\r\ndiscussion of a very important matter, which was dismissed in few\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Nell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthis young Huntingdon has been asking for you:\r\nwhat must I say about it? Your aunt would answer \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but what say\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say yes, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation; for I had\r\nthoroughly made up my mind on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s a good honest answer\xe2\x80\x94wonderful for a\r\ngirl!\xe2\x80\x94Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to your father to-morrow. He\xe2\x80\x99s sure to give his\r\nconsent; so you may look on the matter as settled. You\xe2\x80\x99d have done a\r\ndeal better if you\xe2\x80\x99d taken Wilmot, I can tell you; but that you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve. At your time of life, it\xe2\x80\x99s love that rules the roast: at mine,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s solid, serviceable gold. I suppose now, you\xe2\x80\x99d never dream of\r\nlooking into the state of your husband\xe2\x80\x99s finances, or troubling your\r\nhead about settlements, or anything of that sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, be thankful, then, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve wiser heads to think for you. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t had time, yet, to examine thoroughly into this young rascal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs, but I see that a great part of his father\xe2\x80\x99s fine property has\r\nbeen squandered away;\xe2\x80\x94but still, I think, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty fair share\r\nof it left, and a little careful nursing may make a handsome thing of\r\nit yet; and then we must persuade your father to give you a decent\r\nfortune, as he has only one besides yourself to care for;\xe2\x80\x94and, if you\r\nbehave well, who knows but what I may be induced to remember you in my\r\nwill!\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, putting his fingers to his nose, with a knowing\r\nwink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, uncle, for that and all your kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and I questioned this young spark on the matter of settlements,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued he; \xe2\x80\x9cand he seemed disposed to be generous enough on that\r\npoint\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew he would!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cBut pray don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble your head\xe2\x80\x94or his, or\r\nmine about that; for all I have will be his, and all he has will be\r\nmine; and what more could either of us require?\xe2\x80\x9d And I was about to\r\nmake my exit, but he called me back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he; \xe2\x80\x9cwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned the time yet. When must\r\nit be? Your aunt would put it off till the Lord knows when, but he is\r\nanxious to be bound as soon as may be: he won\xe2\x80\x99t hear of waiting beyond\r\nnext month; and you, I guess, will be of the same mind, so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, uncle; on the contrary, I should like to wait till after\r\nChristmas, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! pooh, pooh! never tell me that tale\xe2\x80\x94I know better,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he; and\r\nhe persisted in his incredulity. Nevertheless, it is quite true. I am\r\nin no hurry at all. How can I be, when I think of the momentous change\r\nthat awaits me, and of all I have to leave? It is happiness enough to\r\nknow that we _are_ to be united; and that he really loves me, and I may\r\nlove _him_ as devotedly, and think of him as often as I please.\r\nHowever, I insisted upon consulting my aunt about the _time_ of the\r\nwedding, for I determined her counsels should not be utterly\r\ndisregarded; and no conclusions on that particular are come to yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 1st.\xe2\x80\x94All is settled now. My father has given his consent, and\r\nthe time is fixed for Christmas, by a sort of compromise between the\r\nrespective advocates for hurry and delay. Milicent Hargrave is to be\r\none bridesmaid and Annabella Wilmot the other\xe2\x80\x94not that I am\r\nparticularly fond of the latter, but she is an intimate of the family,\r\nand I have not another friend.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Milicent of my engagement, she rather provoked me by her\r\nmanner of taking it. After staring a moment in mute surprise, she\r\nsaid,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Helen, I suppose I ought to congratulate you\xe2\x80\x94and I _am_ glad to\r\nsee you so happy; but I did not think you would take him; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp feeling surprised that you should like him so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are so superior to him in every way, and there\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nso bold and reckless about him\xe2\x80\x94so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\xe2\x80\x94but I always feel a\r\nwish to get out of his way when I see him approach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are timid, Milicent; but that\xe2\x80\x99s no fault of his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then his look,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople say he\xe2\x80\x99s handsome, and of\r\ncourse he is; but _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t _like_ that kind of beauty, and I wonder\r\nthat you should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing noble or lofty in his\r\nappearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, you wonder that I can like any one so unlike the stilted\r\nheroes of romance. Well, give me my flesh and blood lover, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nleave all the Sir Herberts and Valentines to you\xe2\x80\x94if you can find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want them,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied with flesh and blood\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94only the spirit must shine through and predominate. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink Mr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s face is too red?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not red at all. There is just a\r\npleasant glow, a healthy freshness in his complexion\xe2\x80\x94the warm, pinky\r\ntint of the whole harmonising with the deeper colour of the cheeks,\r\nexactly as it ought to do. I hate a man to be red and white, like a\r\npainted doll, or all sickly white, or smoky black, or cadaverous\r\nyellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, tastes differ\xe2\x80\x94but _I_ like pale or dark,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, to\r\ntell you the truth, Helen, I had been deluding myself with the hope\r\nthat you would one day be my sister. I expected Walter would be\r\nintroduced to you next season; and I thought you would like him, and\r\nwas certain he would like you; and I flattered myself I should thus\r\nhave the felicity of seeing the two persons I like best in the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94except mamma\xe2\x80\x94united in one. He mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be exactly what you would\r\ncall handsome, but he\xe2\x80\x99s far more distinguished-looking, and nicer and\r\nbetter than Mr. Huntingdon;\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you would say so, if you knew\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, Milicent! You think so, because you\xe2\x80\x99re his sister; and, on\r\nthat account, I\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you; but nobody else should so disparage\r\nArthur Huntingdon to me with impunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Wilmot expressed her feelings on the subject almost as openly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, coming up to me with a smile of no amiable\r\nimport, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to be Mrs. Huntingdon, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you envy me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _dear_, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall probably be Lady Lowborough\r\nsome day, and then you know, dear, I shall be in a capacity to inquire,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you envy _me?_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenceforth I shall envy no one,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! Are you so happy then?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, thoughtfully; and something\r\nvery like a cloud of disappointment shadowed her face. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd does he\r\nlove you\xe2\x80\x94I mean, does he idolise you as much as you do him?\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nfixing her eyes upon me with ill-disguised anxiety for the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be idolised,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am well assured that\r\nhe _loves_ me more than anybody else in the world\xe2\x80\x94as I do him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a nod. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wish?\xe2\x80\x9d asked I, annoyed at the vindictive expression of\r\nher countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d returned, she, with a short laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all the attractive\r\npoints and desirable qualifications of the two gentlemen were united in\r\none\xe2\x80\x94that Lord Lowborough had Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s handsome face and good\r\ntemper, and all his wit, and mirth and charm, or else that Huntingdon\r\nhad Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree, and title, and delightful old family seat,\r\nand I had him; and you might have the other and welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, dear Annabella: I am better satisfied with things as they\r\nare, for my own part; and for you, I wish you were as well content with\r\nyour intended as I am with mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and it was true enough; for,\r\nthough vexed at first at her unamiable spirit, her frankness touched\r\nme, and the contrast between our situations was such, that I could well\r\nafford to pity her and wish her well.\r\n\r\nMr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintances appear to be no better pleased with our\r\napproaching union than mine. This morning\xe2\x80\x99s post brought him letters\r\nfrom several of his friends, during the perusal of which, at the\r\nbreakfast-table, he excited the attention of the company by the\r\nsingular variety of his grimaces. But he crushed them all into his\r\npocket, with a private laugh, and said nothing till the meal was\r\nconcluded. Then, while the company were hanging over the fire or\r\nloitering through the room, previous to settling to their various\r\nmorning avocations, he came and leant over the back of my chair, with\r\nhis face in contact with my curls, and commencing with a quiet little\r\nkiss, poured forth the following complaints into my ear:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, you witch, do you know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve entailed upon me the curses\r\nof all my friends? I wrote to them the other day, to tell them of my\r\nhappy prospects, and now, instead of a bundle of congratulations, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a pocketful of bitter execrations and reproaches. There\xe2\x80\x99s not one\r\nkind wish for me, or one good word for you, among them all. They say\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be no more fun now, no more merry days and glorious nights\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nall my fault\xe2\x80\x94I am the first to break up the jovial band, and others, in\r\npure despair, will follow my example. I was the very life and prop of\r\nthe community, they do me the honour to say, and I have shamefully\r\nbetrayed my trust\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may join them again, if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, somewhat piqued at the\r\nsorrowful tone of his discourse. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry to stand between\r\nany man\xe2\x80\x94or body of men, and so much happiness; and perhaps I can manage\r\nto do without you, as well as your poor deserted friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, no,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98all for love or the world well\r\nlost,\xe2\x80\x99 with me. Let them go to\xe2\x80\x94where they belong, to speak politely.\r\nBut if you saw how they abuse me, Helen, you would love me all the more\r\nfor having ventured so much for your sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pulled out his crumpled letters. I thought he was going to show them\r\nto me, and told him I did not wish to see them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to show them to you, love,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re hardly fit\r\nfor a lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94the most part of them. But look here. This is\r\nGrimsby\xe2\x80\x99s scrawl\xe2\x80\x94only three lines, the sulky dog! He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say much,\r\nto be sure, but his very silence implies more than all the others\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwords, and the less he says, the more he thinks\xe2\x80\x94and this is Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmissive. He is particularly grieved at me, because, forsooth he had\r\nfallen in love with you from his sister\xe2\x80\x99s reports, and meant to have\r\nmarried you himself, as soon as he had sown his wild oats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m vastly obliged to him,\xe2\x80\x9d observed I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd look at this. This is Hattersley\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94every\r\npage stuffed full of railing accusations, bitter curses, and lamentable\r\ncomplaints, ending up with swearing that he\xe2\x80\x99ll get married himself in\r\nrevenge: he\xe2\x80\x99ll throw himself away on the first old maid that chooses to\r\nset her cap at him,\xe2\x80\x94as if _I_ cared what he did with himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif you do give up your intimacy with these men, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think you will have much cause to regret the loss of their\r\nsociety; for it\xe2\x80\x99s my belief they never did you much good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe not; but we\xe2\x80\x99d a merry time of it, too, though mingled with\r\nsorrow and pain, as Lowborough knows to his cost\xe2\x80\x94Ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d and while he\r\nwas laughing at the recollection of Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s troubles, my uncle\r\ncame and slapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you too busy making love to my niece to\r\nmake war with the pheasants?\xe2\x80\x94First of October, remember! Sun shines\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94rain ceased\xe2\x80\x94even Boarham\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid to venture in his waterproof\r\nboots; and Wilmot and I are going to beat you all. I declare, we old\r\n\xe2\x80\x99uns are the keenest sportsmen of the lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you what I can do to-day, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said my companion. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmurder your birds by wholesale, just for keeping me away from better\r\ncompany than either you or them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying he departed; and I saw no more of him till dinner. It\r\nseemed a weary time; I wonder what I shall do without him.\r\n\r\nIt is very true that the three elder gentlemen have proved themselves\r\nmuch keener sportsmen than the two younger ones; for both Lord\r\nLowborough and Arthur Huntingdon have of late almost daily neglected\r\nthe shooting excursions to accompany us in our various rides and\r\nrambles. But these merry times are fast drawing to a close. In less\r\nthan a fortnight the party break up, much to my sorrow, for every day I\r\nenjoy it more and more\xe2\x80\x94now that Messrs. Boarham and Wilmot have ceased\r\nto tease me, and my aunt has ceased to lecture me, and I have ceased to\r\nbe jealous of Annabella\xe2\x80\x94and even to dislike her\xe2\x80\x94and now that Mr.\r\nHuntingdon is become _my_ Arthur, and I may enjoy his society without\r\nrestraint. What _shall_ I do without him, I repeat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 5th.\xe2\x80\x94My cup of sweets is not unmingled: it is dashed with a\r\nbitterness that I cannot hide from myself, disguise it as I will. I may\r\ntry to persuade myself that the sweetness overpowers it; I may call it\r\na pleasant aromatic flavour; but say what I will, it is still there,\r\nand I cannot but taste it. I cannot shut my eyes to Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s faults;\r\nand the more I love him the more they trouble me. His very heart, that\r\nI trusted so, is, I fear, less warm and generous than I thought it. At\r\nleast, he gave me a specimen of his character to-day that seemed to\r\nmerit a harder name than thoughtlessness. He and Lord Lowborough were\r\naccompanying Annabella and me in a long, delightful ride; he was riding\r\nby my side, as usual, and Annabella and Lord Lowborough were a little\r\nbefore us, the latter bending towards his companion as if in tender and\r\nconfidential discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose two will get the start of us, Helen, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t look sharp,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Huntingdon. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll make a match of it, as sure as can be.\r\nThat Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s fairly besotted. But he\xe2\x80\x99ll find himself in a fix when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s got her, I doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99ll find _her_self in a fix when she\xe2\x80\x99s got _him_,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of him is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it. She knows what she\xe2\x80\x99s about; but he, poor fool,\r\ndeludes himself with the notion that she\xe2\x80\x99ll make him a good wife, and\r\nbecause she has amused him with some rodomontade about despising rank\r\nand wealth in matters of love and marriage, he flatters himself that\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s devotedly attached to him; that she will not refuse him for his\r\npoverty, and does not court him for his rank, but loves him for himself\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is not _he_ courting _her_ for her fortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not he. That was the first attraction, certainly; but now he has\r\nquite lost sight of it: it never enters his calculations, except merely\r\nas an essential without which, for the lady\xe2\x80\x99s own sake, he could not\r\nthink of marrying her. No; he\xe2\x80\x99s fairly in love. He thought he never\r\ncould be again, but he\xe2\x80\x99s in for it once more. He was to have been\r\nmarried before, some two or three years ago; but he lost his bride by\r\nlosing his fortune. He got into a bad way among us in London: he had an\r\nunfortunate taste for gambling; and surely the fellow was born under an\r\nunlucky star, for he always lost thrice where he gained once. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmode of self-torment I never was much addicted to. When I spend my\r\nmoney I like to enjoy the full value of it: I see no fun in wasting it\r\non thieves and blacklegs; and as for _gaining_ money, hitherto I have\r\nalways had sufficient; it\xe2\x80\x99s time enough to be clutching for more, I\r\nthink, when you begin to see the end of what you have. But I have\r\nsometimes frequented the gaming-houses just to watch the on-goings of\r\nthose mad votaries of chance\xe2\x80\x94a very interesting study, I assure you,\r\nHelen, and sometimes very diverting: I\xe2\x80\x99ve had many a laugh at the\r\nboobies and bedlamites. Lowborough was quite infatuated\xe2\x80\x94not willingly,\r\nbut of necessity,\xe2\x80\x94he was always resolving to give it up, and always\r\nbreaking his resolutions. Every venture was the \xe2\x80\x9cjust once more:\xe2\x80\x9d if he\r\ngained a little, he hoped to gain a little more next time, and if he\r\nlost, it would not do to leave off at that juncture; he must go on till\r\nhe had retrieved that last misfortune, at least: bad luck could not\r\nlast for ever; and every lucky hit was looked upon as the dawn of\r\nbetter times, till experience proved the contrary. At length he grew\r\ndesperate, and we were daily on the look-out for a case of\r\n_felo-de-se_\xe2\x80\x94no great matter, some of us whispered, as his existence\r\nhad ceased to be an acquisition to our club. At last, however, he came\r\nto a check. He made a large stake, which he determined should be the\r\nlast, whether he lost or won. He had often so determined before, to be\r\nsure, and as often broken his determination; and so it was this time.\r\nHe lost; and while his antagonist smilingly swept away the stakes, he\r\nturned chalky white, drew back in silence, and wiped his forehead. I\r\nwas present at the time; and while he stood with folded arms and eyes\r\nfixed on the ground, I knew well enough what was passing in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Is it to be the last, Lowborough?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, stepping up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The last but ONE,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, with a grim smile; and then, rushing\r\nback to the table, he struck his hand upon it, and, raising his voice\r\nhigh above all the confusion of jingling coins and muttered oaths and\r\ncurses in the room, he swore a deep and solemn oath that, come what\r\nwould, THIS trial _should_ be the last, and imprecated unspeakable\r\ncurses on his head if ever he should shuffle a card or rattle a\r\ndice-box again. He then doubled his former stake, and challenged any\r\none present to play against him. Grimsby instantly presented himself.\r\nLowborough glared fiercely at him, for Grimsby was almost as celebrated\r\nfor his luck as _he_ was for his ill-fortune. However, they fell to\r\nwork. But Grimsby had much skill and little scruple, and whether he\r\ntook advantage of the other\xe2\x80\x99s trembling, blinded eagerness to deal\r\nunfairly by him, I cannot undertake to say; but Lowborough lost again,\r\nand fell dead sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better try once more,\xe2\x80\x99 said Grimsby, leaning across the table.\r\nAnd then he winked at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to try with,\xe2\x80\x99 said the poor devil, with a ghastly smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Huntingdon will lend you what you want,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No; you heard my oath,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Lowborough, turning away in quiet\r\ndespair. And I took him by the arm and led him out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Is it to be the last, Lowborough?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, when I got him into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The last,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, somewhat against my expectation. And I took\r\nhim home\xe2\x80\x94that is, to our club\xe2\x80\x94for he was as submissive as a child\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nplied him with brandy-and-water till he began to look rather\r\nbrighter\xe2\x80\x94rather more alive, at least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Huntingdon, I\xe2\x80\x99m ruined!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, taking the third glass from my\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94he had drunk the others in dead silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Not you,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll find a man can live without his money as\r\nmerrily as a tortoise without its head, or a wasp without its body.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But I\xe2\x80\x99m in debt,\xe2\x80\x99 said he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98deep in debt. And I can never, _never_ get\r\nout of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, what of that? Many a better man than you has lived and died in\r\ndebt; and they can\xe2\x80\x99t put you in prison, you know, because you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\npeer.\xe2\x80\x99 And I handed him his fourth tumbler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But I hate to be in debt!\xe2\x80\x99 he shouted. \xe2\x80\x98I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born for it, and I\r\ncannot _bear_ it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What can\xe2\x80\x99t be cured must be endured,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, beginning to mix the\r\nfifth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my Caroline.\xe2\x80\x99 And he began to snivel then, for\r\nthe brandy had softened his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No matter,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, \xe2\x80\x98there are more Carolines in the world than\r\none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s only one for me,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, with a dolorous sigh. \xe2\x80\x98And if\r\nthere were fifty more, who\xe2\x80\x99s to get them, I wonder, without money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, somebody will take you for your title; and then you\xe2\x80\x99ve your\r\nfamily estate yet; that\xe2\x80\x99s entailed, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I wish to God I could sell it to pay my debts,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Grimsby, who had just come in, \xe2\x80\x98you can _try again_,\r\nyou know. I _would_ have more than one chance, if I were you. I\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nstop here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I _won\xe2\x80\x99t_, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted he. And he started up, and left the\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94walking rather unsteadily, for the liquor had got into his head.\r\nHe was not so much used to it then, but after that he took to it kindly\r\nto solace his cares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kept his oath about gambling (not a little to the surprise of us\r\nall), though Grimsby did his utmost to tempt him to break it, but now\r\nhe had got hold of another habit that bothered him nearly as much, for\r\nhe soon discovered that the demon of drink was as black as the demon of\r\nplay, and nearly as hard to get rid of\xe2\x80\x94especially as his kind friends\r\ndid all they could to second the promptings of his own insatiable\r\ncravings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, they were demons themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, unable to contain my\r\nindignation. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Mr. Huntingdon, it seems, were the first to\r\ntempt him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what could we do?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, deprecatingly.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWe meant it in\r\nkindness\xe2\x80\x94we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see the poor fellow so miserable:\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nbesides, he was such a damper upon us, sitting there silent and glum,\r\nwhen he was under the threefold influence\xe2\x80\x94of the loss of his\r\nsweetheart, the loss of his fortune, and the reaction of the lost\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s debauch; whereas, when he had something in him, if he was not\r\nmerry himself, he was an unfailing source of merriment to us. Even\r\nGrimsby could chuckle over his odd sayings: they delighted him far more\r\nthan my merry jests, or Hattersley\xe2\x80\x99s riotous mirth. But one evening,\r\nwhen we were sitting over our wine, after one of our club dinners, and\r\nall had been hearty together,\xe2\x80\x94Lowborough giving us mad toasts, and\r\nhearing our wild songs, and bearing a hand in the applause, if he did\r\nnot help us to sing them himself,\xe2\x80\x94he suddenly relapsed into silence,\r\nsinking his head on his hand, and never lifting his glass to his\r\nlips;\xe2\x80\x94but this was nothing new; so we let him alone, and went on with\r\nour jollification, till, suddenly raising his head, he interrupted us\r\nin the middle of a roar of laughter by exclaiming,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, where is all this to end?\xe2\x80\x94Will you just tell me _that_\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x94Where is it all to end?\xe2\x80\x9d He rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A speech, a speech!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted we. \xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear! Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\ngive us a speech!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe waited calmly till the thunders of applause and jingling of glasses\r\nhad ceased, and then proceeded,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only this, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nthink we\xe2\x80\x99d better go no further. We\xe2\x80\x99d better stop while we can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Just so!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Hattersley\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop poor sinner, stop and think\r\n    Before you farther go,\r\nNo longer sport upon the brink\r\n    Of everlasting woe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Exactly!\xe2\x80\x99 replied his lordship, with the utmost gravity. \xe2\x80\x98And if\r\n_you_ choose to visit the bottomless pit, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go with you\xe2\x80\x94we must\r\npart company, for I swear I\xe2\x80\x99ll not move another step towards it!\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, taking up his glass of wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Taste it,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98This is hell broth!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98I renounce it for ever!\xe2\x80\x99 And he\r\nthrew it out into the middle of the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Fill again!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, handing him the bottle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98and let us drink to your\r\nrenunciation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s rank poison,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, grasping the bottle by the neck, \xe2\x80\x98and I\r\nforswear it! I\xe2\x80\x99ve given up gambling, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give up this too.\xe2\x80\x99 He was\r\non the point of deliberately pouring the whole contents of the bottle\r\non to the table, but Hargrave wrested it from him. \xe2\x80\x98On you be the\r\ncurse, then!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. And, backing from the room, he shouted,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Farewell, ye tempters!\xe2\x80\x99 and vanished amid shouts of laughter and\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe expected him back among us the next day; but, to our surprise, the\r\nplace remained vacant: we saw nothing of him for a whole week; and we\r\nreally began to think he was going to keep his word. At last, one\r\nevening, when we were most of us assembled together again, he entered,\r\nsilent and grim as a ghost, and would have quietly slipped into his\r\nusual seat at my elbow, but we all rose to welcome him, and several\r\nvoices were raised to ask what he would have, and several hands were\r\nbusy with bottle and glass to serve him; but I knew a smoking tumbler\r\nof brandy-and-water would comfort him best, and had nearly prepared it,\r\nwhen he peevishly pushed it away, saying,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do let me alone, Huntingdon! Do be quiet, all of you! I\xe2\x80\x99m not come to\r\njoin you: I\xe2\x80\x99m only come to be with you awhile, because I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear my\r\nown thoughts.\xe2\x80\x99 And he folded his arms, and leant back in his chair; so\r\nwe let him be. But I left the glass by him; and, after awhile, Grimsby\r\ndirected my attention towards it, by a significant wink; and, on\r\nturning my head, I saw it was drained to the bottom. He made me a sign\r\nto replenish, and quietly pushed up the bottle. I willingly complied;\r\nbut Lowborough detected the pantomime, and, nettled at the intelligent\r\ngrins that were passing between us, snatched the glass from my hand,\r\ndashed the contents of it in Grimsby\xe2\x80\x99s face, threw the empty tumbler at\r\nme, and then bolted from the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he broke your head,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, love,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, laughing immoderately at the recollection of\r\nthe whole affair; \xe2\x80\x9che would have done so,\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps, spoilt my face,\r\ntoo, but, providentially, this forest of curls\xe2\x80\x9d (taking off his hat,\r\nand showing his luxuriant chestnut locks) \xe2\x80\x9csaved my skull, and\r\nprevented the glass from breaking, till it reached the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cLowborough kept aloof from us a week or\r\ntwo longer. I used to meet him occasionally in the town; and then, as I\r\nwas too good-natured to resent his unmannerly conduct, and he bore no\r\nmalice against me,\xe2\x80\x94he was never unwilling to talk to me; on the\r\ncontrary, he would cling to me, and follow me anywhere but to the club,\r\nand the gaming-houses, and such-like dangerous places of resort\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nso weary of his own moping, melancholy mind. At last, I got him to come\r\nin with me to the club, on condition that I would not tempt him to\r\ndrink; and, for some time, he continued to look in upon us pretty\r\nregularly of an evening,\xe2\x80\x94still abstaining, with wonderful perseverance,\r\nfrom the \xe2\x80\x98rank poison\xe2\x80\x99 he had so bravely forsworn. But some of our\r\nmembers protested against this conduct. They did not like to have him\r\nsitting there like a skeleton at a feast, instead of contributing his\r\nquota to the general amusement, casting a cloud over all, and watching,\r\nwith greedy eyes, every drop they carried to their lips\xe2\x80\x94they vowed it\r\nwas not fair; and some of them maintained that he should either be\r\ncompelled to do as others did, or expelled from the society; and swore\r\nthat, next time he showed himself, they would tell him as much, and, if\r\nhe did not take the warning, proceed to active measures. However, I\r\nbefriended him on this occasion, and recommended them to let him be for\r\na while, intimating that, with a little patience on our parts, he would\r\nsoon come round again. But, to be sure, it _was_ rather provoking; for,\r\nthough he refused to drink like an honest Christian, it was well known\r\nto me that he kept a private bottle of laudanum about him, which he was\r\ncontinually soaking at\xe2\x80\x94or rather, holding off and on with, abstaining\r\none day and exceeding the next\xe2\x80\x94just like the spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night, however, during one of our orgies\xe2\x80\x94one of our high\r\nfestivals, I mean\xe2\x80\x94he glided in, like the ghost in \xe2\x80\x98Macbeth,\xe2\x80\x99 and seated\r\nhimself, as usual, a little back from the table, in the chair we always\r\nplaced for \xe2\x80\x98the spectre,\xe2\x80\x99 whether it chose to fill it or not. I saw by\r\nhis face that he was suffering from the effects of an overdose of his\r\ninsidious comforter; but nobody spoke to him, and he spoke to nobody. A\r\nfew sidelong glances, and a whispered observation, that \xe2\x80\x98the ghost was\r\ncome,\xe2\x80\x99 was all the notice he drew by his appearance, and we went on\r\nwith our merry carousals as before, till he startled us all by suddenly\r\ndrawing in his chair, and leaning forward with his elbows on the table,\r\nand exclaiming with portentous solemnity,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! it puzzles me what you can find to be so merry about. What _you_\r\nsee in life I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94_I_ see only the blackness of darkness, and a\r\nfearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the company simultaneously pushed up their glasses to him, and I\r\nset them before him in a semicircle, and, tenderly patting him on the\r\nback, bid him drink, and he would soon see as bright a prospect as any\r\nof us; but he pushed them back, muttering,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Take them away! I won\xe2\x80\x99t taste it, I tell you. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 So I\r\nhanded them down again to the owners; but I saw that he followed them\r\nwith a glare of hungry regret as they departed. Then he clasped his\r\nhands before his eyes to shut out the sight, and two minutes after\r\nlifted his head again, and said, in a hoarse but vehement whisper,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And yet I must! Huntingdon, get me a glass!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Take the bottle, man!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, thrusting the brandy-bottle into his\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94but stop, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling too much,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the narrator, startled\r\nat the look I turned upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he recklessly added,\r\nand thus continued his relation: \xe2\x80\x9cIn his desperate eagerness, he seized\r\nthe bottle and sucked away, till he suddenly dropped from his chair,\r\ndisappearing under the table amid a tempest of applause. The\r\nconsequence of this imprudence was something like an apoplectic fit,\r\nfollowed by a rather severe brain fever\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you think of _yourself_, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I was very penitent,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI went to see him once\r\nor twice\xe2\x80\x94nay, twice or thrice\xe2\x80\x94or by\xe2\x80\x99r lady, some four times\xe2\x80\x94and when he\r\ngot better, I tenderly brought him back to the fold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I restored him to the bosom of the club, and compassionating\r\nthe feebleness of his health and extreme lowness of his spirits, I\r\nrecommended him to \xe2\x80\x98take a little wine for his stomach\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x99 and,\r\nwhen he was sufficiently re-established, to embrace the media-via,\r\nni-jamais-ni-toujours plan\xe2\x80\x94not to kill himself like a fool, and not to\r\nabstain like a ninny\xe2\x80\x94in a word, to enjoy himself like a rational\r\ncreature, and do as I did; for, don\xe2\x80\x99t think, Helen, that I\xe2\x80\x99m a tippler;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m nothing at all of the kind, and never was, and never shall be. I\r\nvalue my comfort far too much. I see that a man cannot give himself up\r\nto drinking without being miserable one-half his days and mad the\r\nother; besides, I like to enjoy my life at all sides and ends, which\r\ncannot be done by one that suffers himself to be the slave of a single\r\npropensity\xe2\x80\x94and, moreover, drinking spoils one\xe2\x80\x99s good looks,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nconcluded, with a most conceited smile that ought to have provoked me\r\nmore than it did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did Lord Lowborough profit by your advice?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, in a manner. For a while he managed very well; indeed, he\r\nwas a model of moderation and prudence\xe2\x80\x94something too much so for the\r\ntastes of our wild community; but, somehow, Lowborough had not the gift\r\nof moderation: if he stumbled a little to one side, he must go down\r\nbefore he could right himself: if he overshot the mark one night, the\r\neffects of it rendered him so miserable the next day that he must\r\nrepeat the offence to mend it; and so on from day to day, till his\r\nclamorous conscience brought him to a stand. And then, in his sober\r\nmoments, he so bothered his friends with his remorse, and his terrors\r\nand woes, that they were obliged, in self-defence, to get him to drown\r\nhis sorrows in wine, or any more potent beverage that came to hand; and\r\nwhen his first scruples of conscience were overcome, he would need no\r\nmore persuading, he would often grow desperate, and be as great a\r\nblackguard as any of them could desire\xe2\x80\x94but only to lament his own\r\nunutterable wickedness and degradation the more when the fit was over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last, one day when he and I were alone together, after pondering\r\nawhile in one of his gloomy, abstracted moods, with his arms folded and\r\nhis head sunk on his breast, he suddenly woke up, and vehemently\r\ngrasping my arm, said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Huntingdon, this won\xe2\x80\x99t do! I\xe2\x80\x99m resolved to have done with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What, are you going to shoot yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reform.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ nothing new! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been going to reform these twelve\r\nmonths and more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me; and I was such a fool I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live\r\nwithout you. But now I see what it is that keeps me back, and what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwanted to save me; and I\xe2\x80\x99d compass sea and land to get it\xe2\x80\x94only I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance.\xe2\x80\x99 And he sighed as if his heart would break.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is it, Lowborough?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, thinking he was fairly cracked at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A wife,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered; \xe2\x80\x98for I can\xe2\x80\x99t live alone, because my own mind\r\ndistracts me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t live with you, because you take the devil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart against me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x94I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x94all of you do\xe2\x80\x94and you more than any of them, you know. But if I\r\ncould get a wife, with fortune enough to pay off my debts and set me\r\nstraight in the world\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And sweetness and goodness enough,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98to make home\r\ntolerable, and to reconcile me to myself, I think I should do yet. I\r\nshall never be in love again, that\xe2\x80\x99s certain; but perhaps that would be\r\nno great matter, it would enable me to choose with my eyes open\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nshould make a good husband in spite of it; but could any one be in love\r\nwith _me?_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the question. With _your_ good looks and powers of\r\nfascination\xe2\x80\x99 (he was pleased to say), \xe2\x80\x98I might hope; but as it is,\r\nHuntingdon, do you think _any_body would take me\xe2\x80\x94ruined and wretched as\r\nI am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why, any neglected old maid, fast sinking in despair, would be\r\ndelighted to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98it must be somebody that I can love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why, you just said you never could be in love again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, love is not the word\xe2\x80\x94but somebody that I can like. I\xe2\x80\x99ll search\r\nall England through, at all events!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, with a sudden burst of\r\nhope, or desperation. \xe2\x80\x98Succeed or fail, it will be better than rushing\r\nheadlong to destruction at that d\xe2\x80\x94d club: so farewell to it and you.\r\nWhenever I meet you on honest ground or under a Christian roof, I shall\r\nbe glad to see you; but never more shall you entice me to that _devil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nden!_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was shameful language, but I shook hands with him, and we parted.\r\nHe kept his word; and from that time forward he has been a pattern of\r\npropriety, as far as I can tell; but till lately I have not had very\r\nmuch to do with him. He occasionally sought my company, but as\r\nfrequently shrunk from it, fearing lest I should wile him back to\r\ndestruction, and I found his not very entertaining, especially as he\r\nsometimes attempted to awaken my conscience and draw me from the\r\nperdition he considered himself to have escaped; but when I did happen\r\nto meet him, I seldom failed to ask after the progress of his\r\nmatrimonial efforts and researches, and, in general, he could give me\r\nbut a poor account. The mothers were repelled by his empty coffers and\r\nhis reputation for gambling, and the daughters by his cloudy brow and\r\nmelancholy temper\xe2\x80\x94besides, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them; he wanted the\r\nspirit and assurance to carry his point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him at it when I went to the continent; and on my return, at\r\nthe year\xe2\x80\x99s end, I found him still a disconsolate bachelor\xe2\x80\x94though,\r\ncertainly, looking somewhat less like an unblest exile from the tomb\r\nthan before. The young ladies had ceased to be afraid of him, and were\r\nbeginning to think him quite interesting; but the mammas were still\r\nunrelenting. It was about this time, Helen, that my good angel brought\r\nme into conjunction with you; and then I had eyes and ears for nobody\r\nelse. But, meantime, Lowborough became acquainted with our charming\r\nfriend, Miss Wilmot\xe2\x80\x94through the intervention of _his_ good angel, no\r\ndoubt he would tell you, though he did not dare to fix his hopes on one\r\nso courted and admired, till after they were brought into closer\r\ncontact here at Staningley, and she, in the absence of her other\r\nadmirers, indubitably courted his notice and held out every\r\nencouragement to his timid advances. Then, indeed, he began to hope for\r\na dawn of brighter days; and if, for a while, I darkened his prospects\r\nby standing between him and his sun\xe2\x80\x94and so nearly plunged him again\r\ninto the abyss of despair\xe2\x80\x94it only intensified his ardour and\r\nstrengthened his hopes when I chose to abandon the field in the pursuit\r\nof a brighter treasure. In a word, as I told you, he is fairly\r\nbesotted. At first, he could dimly perceive her faults, and they gave\r\nhim considerable uneasiness; but now his passion and her art together\r\nhave blinded him to everything but her perfections and his amazing good\r\nfortune. Last night he came to me brimful of his new-found felicity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Huntingdon, I am not a castaway!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, seizing my hand and\r\nsqueezing it like a vice. \xe2\x80\x98There is happiness in store for me yet\xe2\x80\x94even\r\nin this life\xe2\x80\x94she loves me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98Has she told you so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, but I can no longer doubt it. Do you not see how pointedly kind\r\nand affectionate she is? And she knows the utmost extent of my poverty,\r\nand cares nothing about it! She knows all the folly and all the\r\nwickedness of my former life, and is not afraid to trust me\xe2\x80\x94and my rank\r\nand title are no allurements to her; for them she utterly disregards.\r\nShe is the most generous, high-minded being that can be conceived of.\r\nShe will save me, body and soul, from destruction. Already, she has\r\nennobled me in my own estimation, and made me three times better,\r\nwiser, greater than I was. Oh! if I had but known her before, how much\r\ndegradation and misery I should have been spared! But what have I done\r\nto deserve so magnificent a creature?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the cream of the jest,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Huntingdon, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cis,\r\nthat the artful minx loves nothing about him but his title and\r\npedigree, and \xe2\x80\x98that delightful old family seat.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me so herself; she said, \xe2\x80\x98As for the man himself, I\r\nthoroughly despise him; but then, I suppose, it is time to be making my\r\nchoice, and if I waited for some one capable of eliciting my esteem and\r\naffection, I should have to pass my life in single blessedness, for I\r\ndetest you all!\xe2\x80\x99 Ha, ha! I suspect she was wrong there; but, however,\r\nit is evident she has no love for _him_, poor fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you ought to tell him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! and spoil all her plans and prospects, poor girl? No, no: that\r\nwould be a breach of confidence, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Helen? Ha, ha! Besides,\r\nit would break his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d And he laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Huntingdon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you see so amazingly diverting\r\nin the matter; I see nothing to laugh at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m laughing at _you_, just now, love,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, redoubling his\r\nmachinations.\r\n\r\nAnd leaving him to enjoy his merriment alone, I touched Ruby with the\r\nwhip, and cantered on to rejoin our companions; for we had been walking\r\nour horses all this time, and were consequently a long way behind.\r\nArthur was soon at my side again; but not disposed to talk to him, I\r\nbroke into a gallop. He did the same; and we did not slacken our pace\r\ntill we came up with Miss Wilmot and Lord Lowborough, which was within\r\nhalf a mile of the park-gates. I avoided all further conversation with\r\nhim till we came to the end of our ride, when I meant to jump off my\r\nhorse and vanish into the house, before he could offer his assistance;\r\nbut while I was disengaging my habit from the crutch, he lifted me off,\r\nand held me by both hands, asserting that he would not let me go till I\r\nhad forgiven him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to forgive,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not injured _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, darling\xe2\x80\x94God forbid that I should! but you are angry because it was\r\nto me that Annabella confessed her lack of esteem for her lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Arthur, it is not _that_ that displeases me: it is the whole\r\nsystem of your conduct towards your friend, and if you wish me to\r\nforget it, go now, and tell him what sort of a woman it is that he\r\nadores so madly, and on whom he has hung his hopes of future\r\nhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Helen, it would break his heart\xe2\x80\x94it would be the death of\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94besides being a scandalous trick to poor Annabella. There is no\r\nhelp for him now; he is past praying for. Besides, she may keep up the\r\ndeception to the end of the chapter; and then he will be just as happy\r\nin the illusion as if it were reality; or perhaps he will only discover\r\nhis mistake when he has ceased to love her; and if not, it is much\r\nbetter that the truth should dawn gradually upon him. So now, my angel,\r\nI hope I have made out a clear case, and fully convinced you that I\r\ncannot make the atonement you require. What other requisition have you\r\nto make? Speak, and I will gladly obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have none but this,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as gravely as before: \xe2\x80\x9cthat, in future,\r\nyou will never make a jest of the sufferings of others, and always use\r\nyour influence with your friends for their own advantage against their\r\nevil propensities, instead of seconding their evil propensities against\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do my utmost,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto remember and perform the\r\ninjunctions of my angel monitress;\xe2\x80\x9d and after kissing both my gloved\r\nhands, he let me go.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered my room, I was surprised to see Annabella Wilmot\r\nstanding before my toilet-table, composedly surveying her features in\r\nthe glass, with one hand flirting her gold-mounted whip, and the other\r\nholding up her long habit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe certainly _is_ a magnificent creature!\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, as I beheld\r\nthat tall, finely developed figure, and the reflection of the handsome\r\nface in the mirror before me, with the glossy dark hair, slightly and\r\nnot ungracefully disordered by the breezy ride, the rich brown\r\ncomplexion glowing with exercise, and the black eyes sparkling with\r\nunwonted brilliance. On perceiving me, she turned round, exclaiming,\r\nwith a laugh that savoured more of malice than of mirth,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Helen! what _have_ you been doing so long? I came to tell you my\r\ngood fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, regardless of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s presence. \xe2\x80\x9cLord\r\nLowborough has proposed, and I have been graciously pleased to accept\r\nhim. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you envy me, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, love,\xe2\x80\x9d said I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor him either,\xe2\x80\x9d I mentally added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you like\r\nhim, Annabella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike him! yes, to be sure\xe2\x80\x94over head and ears in love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll make him a good wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my dear! And what besides do you hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will both love each other, and both be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks; and I hope you will make a _very_ good wife to Mr.\r\nHuntingdon!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a queenly bow, and retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss! how could you say so to her!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay what?\xe2\x80\x9d replied I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that you hoped she would make him a good wife. I never heard such\r\na thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I do hope it, or rather, I wish it; she\xe2\x80\x99s almost past hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll make _her_ a good husband.\r\nThey tell queer things about him downstairs. They were saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, Rachel. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard all about him; but he\xe2\x80\x99s reformed now. And\r\nthey have no business to tell tales about their masters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mum\xe2\x80\x94or else, they _have_ said some things about Mr. Huntingdon\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t hear them, Rachel; they tell lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, quietly, as she went on arranging my hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo _you_ believe them, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, after a short pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss, not all. You know when a lot of servants gets together they\r\nlike to talk about their betters; and some, for a bit of swagger, likes\r\nto make it appear as though they knew more than they do, and to throw\r\nout hints and things just to astonish the others. But I think, if I was\r\nyou, Miss Helen, I\xe2\x80\x99d look _very_ well before I leaped. I do believe a\r\nyoung lady can\xe2\x80\x99t be too careful who she marries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut be quick, will you, Rachel? I want to be\r\ndressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I was anxious to be rid of the good woman, for I was in\r\nsuch a melancholy frame I could hardly keep the tears out of my eyes\r\nwhile she dressed me. It was not for Lord Lowborough\xe2\x80\x94it was not for\r\nAnnabella\xe2\x80\x94it was not for myself\xe2\x80\x94it was for Arthur Huntingdon that they\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n13th.\xe2\x80\x94They are gone, and he is gone. We are to be parted for more than\r\ntwo months, above ten weeks! a long, long time to live and not to see\r\nhim. But he has promised to write often, and made me promise to write\r\nstill oftener, because he will be busy settling his affairs, and I\r\nshall have nothing better to do. Well, I think I shall always have\r\nplenty to say. But oh! for the time when we shall be always together,\r\nand can exchange our thoughts without the intervention of these cold\r\ngo-betweens, pen, ink, and paper!\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n22nd.\xe2\x80\x94I have had several letters from Arthur already. They are not\r\nlong, but passing sweet, and just like himself, full of ardent\r\naffection, and playful lively humour; but there is always a _but_ in\r\nthis imperfect world, and I do wish he would _sometimes_ be serious. I\r\ncannot get him to write or speak in real, solid earnest. I don\xe2\x80\x99t much\r\nmind it now, but if it be always so, what shall I do with the serious\r\npart of myself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFeb. 18, 1822.\xe2\x80\x94Early this morning Arthur mounted his hunter and set off\r\nin high glee to meet the \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 hounds. He will be away all day, and so I\r\nwill amuse myself with my neglected diary, if I can give that name to\r\nsuch an irregular composition. It is exactly four months since I opened\r\nit last.\r\n\r\nI am married now, and settled down as Mrs. Huntingdon of Grassdale\r\nManor. I have had eight weeks\xe2\x80\x99 experience of matrimony. And do I regret\r\nthe step I have taken? No, though I must confess, in my secret heart,\r\nthat Arthur is not what I thought him at first, and if I had known him\r\nin the beginning as thoroughly as I do now, I probably never should\r\nhave loved him, and if I loved him first, and then made the discovery,\r\nI fear I should have thought it my duty not to have married him. To be\r\nsure I might have known him, for every one was willing enough to tell\r\nme about him, and he himself was no accomplished hypocrite, but I was\r\nwilfully blind; and now, instead of regretting that I did not discern\r\nhis full character before I was indissolubly bound to him, I am _glad_,\r\nfor it has saved me a great deal of battling with my conscience, and a\r\ngreat deal of consequent trouble and pain; and, whatever I _ought_ to\r\nhave done, my duty now is plainly to love him and to cleave to him, and\r\nthis just tallies with my inclination.\r\n\r\nHe is very fond of me, almost _too_ fond. I could do with less\r\ncaressing and more rationality. I should like to be less of a pet and\r\nmore of a friend, if I might choose; but I won\xe2\x80\x99t complain of that: I am\r\nonly afraid his affection loses in depth where it gains in ardour. I\r\nsometimes liken it to a fire of dry twigs and branches compared with\r\none of solid coal, very bright and hot; but if it should burn itself\r\nout and leave nothing but ashes behind, what shall I do? But it won\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nit _shan_\xe2\x80\x99t, I am determined; and surely I have power to keep it alive.\r\nSo let me dismiss _that_ thought at once. But Arthur is selfish; I am\r\nconstrained to acknowledge that; and, indeed, the admission gives me\r\nless pain than might be expected, for, since _I_ love him so much, I\r\ncan easily forgive him for loving himself: he likes to be pleased, and\r\nit is my delight to please him; and when I regret this tendency of his,\r\nit is for his own sake, not for mine.\r\n\r\nThe first instance he gave was on the occasion of our bridal tour. He\r\nwanted to hurry it over, for all the continental scenes were already\r\nfamiliar to him: many had lost their interest in his eyes, and others\r\nhad never had anything to lose. The consequence was, that after a\r\nflying transit through part of France and part of Italy, I came back\r\nnearly as ignorant as I went, having made no acquaintance with persons\r\nand manners, and very little with things, my head swarming with a\r\nmotley confusion of objects and scenes; some, it is true, leaving a\r\ndeeper and more pleasing impression than others, but these embittered\r\nby the recollection that my emotions had not been shared by my\r\ncompanion, but that, on the contrary, when I had expressed a particular\r\ninterest in anything that I saw or desired to see, it had been\r\ndispleasing to him, inasmuch as it proved that I could take delight in\r\nanything disconnected with himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs for Paris, we only just touched at that, and he would not give me\r\ntime to see one-tenth of the beauties and interesting objects of Rome.\r\nHe wanted to get me home, he said, to have me all to himself, and to\r\nsee me safely installed as the mistress of Grassdale Manor, just as\r\nsingle-minded, as na\xc3\xafve, and piquante as I was; and as if I had been\r\nsome frail butterfly, he expressed himself fearful of rubbing the\r\nsilver off my wings by bringing me into contact with society,\r\nespecially that of Paris and Rome; and, more-over, he did not scruple\r\nto tell me that there were ladies in both places that would tear his\r\neyes out if they happened to meet him with me.\r\n\r\nOf course I was vexed at all this; but still it was less the\r\ndisappointment to myself that annoyed me, than the disappointment _in\r\nhim_, and the trouble I was at to frame excuses to my friends for\r\nhaving seen and observed so little, without imputing one particle of\r\nblame to my companion. But when we got home\xe2\x80\x94to my new, delightful\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94I was so happy and he was so kind that I freely forgave him all;\r\nand I was beginning to think my lot _too_ happy, and my husband\r\nactually too good for me, if not too good for this world, when, on the\r\nsecond Sunday after our arrival, he shocked and horrified me by another\r\ninstance of his unreasonable exaction. We were walking home from the\r\nmorning service, for it was a fine frosty day, and as we are so near\r\nthe church, I had requested the carriage should not be used.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with unusual gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not quite satisfied with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI desired to know what was wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will you promise to reform if I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if I can, and without offending a higher authority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there it is, you see: you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me with all your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, Arthur (at least I hope I don\xe2\x80\x99t): pray tell me\r\nwhat I have done or said amiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing you have done or said; it is something that you _are:_\r\nyou are too religious. Now I like a woman to be religious, and I think\r\nyour piety one of your greatest charms; but then, like all other good\r\nthings, it may be carried too far. To my thinking, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s religion\r\nought not to lessen her devotion to her earthly lord. She should have\r\nenough to purify and etherealise her soul, but not enough to refine\r\naway her heart, and raise her above all human sympathies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am _I_ above all human sympathies?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, darling; but you are making more progress towards that saintly\r\ncondition than I like; for all these two hours I have been thinking of\r\nyou and wanting to catch your eye, and you were so absorbed in your\r\ndevotions that you had not even a glance to spare for me\xe2\x80\x94I declare it\r\nis enough to make one jealous of one\xe2\x80\x99s Maker\xe2\x80\x94which is very wrong, you\r\nknow; so don\xe2\x80\x99t excite such wicked passions again, for my soul\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give my whole heart and soul to my Maker if I can,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand not one atom more of it to you than He allows. What are _you_,\r\nsir, that you should set yourself up as a god, and presume to dispute\r\npossession of my heart with Him to whom I owe all I have and all I am,\r\nevery blessing I ever did or ever can enjoy\xe2\x80\x94and yourself among the\r\nrest\xe2\x80\x94if you _are_ a blessing, which I am half inclined to doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard upon me, Helen; and don\xe2\x80\x99t pinch my arm so: you are\r\nsqueezing your fingers into the bone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArthur,\xe2\x80\x9d continued I, relaxing my hold of his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t love me\r\nhalf as much as I do you; and yet, if you loved me far less than you\r\ndo, I would not complain, provided you loved your Maker more. I should\r\n_rejoice_ to see you at any time so deeply absorbed in your devotions\r\nthat you had not a single thought to spare for me. But, indeed, I\r\nshould lose nothing by the change, for the more you loved your God the\r\nmore deep and pure and true would be your love to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this he only laughed and kissed my hand, calling me a sweet\r\nenthusiast. Then taking off his hat, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut look here,\r\nHelen\xe2\x80\x94what can a man do with such a head as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head looked right enough, but when he placed my hand on the top of\r\nit, it sunk in a bed of curls, rather alarmingly low, especially in the\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see I was not made to be a saint,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cIf God\r\nmeant me to be religious, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t He give me a proper organ of\r\nveneration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are like the servant,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwho, instead of employing his\r\none talent in his master\xe2\x80\x99s service, restored it to him unimproved,\r\nalleging, as an excuse, that he knew him \xe2\x80\x98to be a hard man, reaping\r\nwhere he had not sown, and gathering where he had not strawed.\xe2\x80\x99 Of him\r\nto whom less is given, less will be required, but our utmost exertions\r\nare required of us all. You are not without the capacity of veneration,\r\nand faith and hope, and conscience and reason, and every other\r\nrequisite to a Christian\xe2\x80\x99s character, if you choose to employ them; but\r\nall our talents increase in the using, and every faculty, both good and\r\nbad, strengthens by exercise: therefore, if you choose to use the bad,\r\nor those which tend to evil, till they become your masters, and neglect\r\nthe good till they dwindle away, you have only yourself to blame. But\r\nyou _have_ talents, Arthur\xe2\x80\x94natural endowments both of heart and mind\r\nand temper, such as many a better Christian would be glad to possess,\r\nif you would only employ them in God\xe2\x80\x99s service. I should never expect\r\nto see you a devotee, but it is quite possible to be a good Christian\r\nwithout ceasing to be a happy, merry-hearted man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak like an oracle, Helen, and all you say is indisputably true;\r\nbut listen here: I am hungry, and I see before me a good substantial\r\ndinner; I am told that if I abstain from this to-day I shall have a\r\nsumptuous feast to-morrow, consisting of all manner of dainties and\r\ndelicacies. Now, in the first place, I should be loth to wait till\r\nto-morrow when I have the means of appeasing my hunger already before\r\nme: in the second place, the solid viands of to-day are more to my\r\ntaste than the dainties that are promised me; in the third place, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t _see_ to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s banquet, and how can I tell that it is not all\r\na fable, got up by the greasy-faced fellow that is advising me to\r\nabstain in order that he may have all the good victuals to himself? in\r\nthe fourth place, this table must be spread for somebody, and, as\r\nSolomon says, \xe2\x80\x98Who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto more than\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x99 and finally, with your leave, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down and satisfy my cravings\r\nof to-day, and leave to-morrow to shift for itself\xe2\x80\x94who knows but what I\r\nmay secure both this and that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not required to abstain from the substantial dinner of\r\nto-day: you are only advised to partake of these coarser viands in such\r\nmoderation as not to incapacitate you from enjoying the choicer banquet\r\nof to-morrow. If, regardless of that counsel, you choose to make a\r\nbeast of yourself now, and over-eat and over-drink yourself till you\r\nturn the good victuals into poison, who is to blame if, hereafter,\r\nwhile you are suffering the torments of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s gluttony and\r\ndrunkenness, you see more temperate men sitting down to enjoy\r\nthemselves at that splendid entertainment which you are unable to\r\ntaste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost true, my patron saint; but again, our friend Solomon says, \xe2\x80\x98There\r\nis nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink, and to be\r\nmerry.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd again,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I, \xe2\x80\x9che says, \xe2\x80\x98Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth;\r\nand walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes:\r\nbut know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into\r\njudgment.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but, Helen, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very good these last few weeks.\r\nWhat have you seen amiss in me, and what would you have me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more than you do, Arthur: your actions are all right so far;\r\nbut I would have your thoughts changed; I would have you to fortify\r\nyourself against temptation, and not to call evil good, and good evil;\r\nI should wish you to think more deeply, to look further, and aim higher\r\nthan you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 25th.\xe2\x80\x94Arthur is getting tired\xe2\x80\x94not of me, I trust, but of the\r\nidle, quiet life he leads\xe2\x80\x94and no wonder, for he has so few sources of\r\namusement: he never reads anything but newspapers and sporting\r\nmagazines; and when he sees me occupied with a book, he won\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\nrest till I close it. In fine weather he generally manages to get\r\nthrough the time pretty well, but on rainy days, of which we have had a\r\ngood many of late, it is quite painful to witness his ennui. I do all I\r\ncan to amuse him, but it is impossible to get him to feel interested in\r\nwhat I most like to talk about, while, on the other hand, he likes to\r\ntalk about things that cannot interest me\xe2\x80\x94or even that annoy me\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthese please him\xe2\x80\x94the most of all: for his favourite amusement is to sit\r\nor loll beside me on the sofa, and tell me stories of his former\r\namours, always turning upon the ruin of some confiding girl or the\r\ncozening of some unsuspecting husband; and when I express my horror and\r\nindignation, he lays it all to the charge of jealousy, and laughs till\r\nthe tears run down his cheeks. I used to fly into passions or melt into\r\ntears at first, but seeing that his delight increased in proportion to\r\nmy anger and agitation, I have since endeavoured to suppress my\r\nfeelings and receive his revelations in the silence of calm contempt;\r\nbut still he reads the inward struggle in my face, and misconstrues my\r\nbitterness of soul for his unworthiness into the pangs of wounded\r\njealousy; and when he has sufficiently diverted himself with that, or\r\nfears my displeasure will become too serious for his comfort, he tries\r\nto kiss and soothe me into smiles again\xe2\x80\x94never were his caresses so\r\nlittle welcome as then! This is _double_ selfishness, displayed to me\r\nand to the victims of his former love. There are times when, with a\r\nmomentary pang\xe2\x80\x94a flash of wild dismay, I ask myself, \xe2\x80\x9cHelen, what have\r\nyou done?\xe2\x80\x9d But I rebuke the inward questioner, and repel the obtrusive\r\nthoughts that crowd upon me; for were he ten times as sensual and\r\nimpenetrable to good and lofty thoughts, I well know I have no right to\r\ncomplain. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t complain. I do and will love him still;\r\nand I do not and will not regret that I have linked my fate with his.\r\n\r\nApril 4th.\xe2\x80\x94We have had a downright quarrel. The particulars are as\r\nfollows: Arthur had told me, at different intervals, the whole story of\r\nhis intrigue with Lady F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, which I would not believe before. It was\r\nsome consolation, however, to find that in this instance the lady had\r\nbeen more to blame than he, for he was very young at the time, and she\r\nhad decidedly made the first advances, if what he said was true. I\r\nhated her for it, for it seemed as if she had chiefly contributed to\r\nhis corruption; and when he was beginning to talk about her the other\r\nday, I begged he would not mention her, for I detested the very sound\r\nof her name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot because you loved her, Arthur, mind, but because she injured you\r\nand deceived her husband, and was altogether a very abominable woman,\r\nwhom you ought to be ashamed to mention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he defended her by saying that she had a doting old husband, whom\r\nit was impossible to love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did she marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor his money,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that was another crime, and her solemn promise to love and honour\r\nhim was another, that only increased the enormity of the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too severe upon the poor lady,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut never mind,\r\nHelen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for her now; and I never loved any of them half as\r\nmuch as I do you, so you needn\xe2\x80\x99t fear to be forsaken like them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had told me these things before, Arthur, I never should have\r\ngiven you the chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ you, my darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could convince you of it now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, starting up from\r\nbeside him: and for the first time in my life, and I hope the last, I\r\nwished I had not married him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, more gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know that if I believed you now\r\nI should be very angry? but thank heaven I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Though you stand\r\nthere with your white face and flashing eyes, looking at me like a very\r\ntigress, I know the heart within you perhaps a trifle better than you\r\nknow it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout another word I left the room and locked myself up in my own\r\nchamber. In about half an hour he came to the door, and first he tried\r\nthe handle, then he knocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you let me in, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; you have displeased me,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see your face or hear your voice again\r\ntill the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment as if dumfounded or uncertain how to answer such a\r\nspeech, and then turned and walked away. This was only an hour after\r\ndinner: I knew he would find it very dull to sit alone all the evening;\r\nand this considerably softened my resentment, though it did not make me\r\nrelent. I was determined to show him that my heart was not his slave,\r\nand I could live without him if I chose; and I sat down and wrote a\r\nlong letter to my aunt, of course telling her nothing of all this. Soon\r\nafter ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock I heard him come up again, but he passed my door and\r\nwent straight to his own dressing-room, where he shut himself in for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nI was rather anxious to see how he would meet me in the morning, and\r\nnot a little disappointed to behold him enter the breakfast-room with a\r\ncareless smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you cross still, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, approaching as if to salute me.\r\nI coldly turned to the table, and began to pour out the coffee,\r\nobserving that he was rather late.\r\n\r\nHe uttered a low whistle and sauntered away to the window, where he\r\nstood for some minutes looking out upon the pleasing prospect of sullen\r\ngrey clouds, streaming rain, soaking lawn, and dripping leafless trees,\r\nand muttering execrations on the weather, and then sat down to\r\nbreakfast. While taking his coffee he muttered it was \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x94d cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not have left it so long,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, and the meal was concluded in silence. It was a\r\nrelief to both when the letter-bag was brought in. It contained upon\r\nexamination a newspaper and one or two letters for him, and a couple of\r\nletters for me, which he tossed across the table without a remark. One\r\nwas from my brother, the other from Milicent Hargrave, who is now in\r\nLondon with her mother. His, I think, were business letters, and\r\napparently not much to his mind, for he crushed them into his pocket\r\nwith some muttered expletives that I should have reproved him for at\r\nany other time. The paper he set before him, and pretended to be deeply\r\nabsorbed in its contents during the remainder of breakfast, and a\r\nconsiderable time after.\r\n\r\nThe reading and answering of my letters, and the direction of household\r\nconcerns, afforded me ample employment for the morning: after lunch I\r\ngot my drawing, and from dinner till bed-time I read. Meanwhile, poor\r\nArthur was sadly at a loss for something to amuse him or to occupy his\r\ntime. He wanted to appear as busy and as unconcerned as I did. Had the\r\nweather at all permitted, he would doubtless have ordered his horse and\r\nset off to some distant region, no matter where, immediately after\r\nbreakfast, and not returned till night: had there been a lady anywhere\r\nwithin reach, of any age between fifteen and forty-five, he would have\r\nsought revenge and found employment in getting up, or trying to get up,\r\na desperate flirtation with her; but being, to my private satisfaction,\r\nentirely cut off from both these sources of diversion, his sufferings\r\nwere truly deplorable. When he had done yawning over his paper and\r\nscribbling short answers to his shorter letters, he spent the remainder\r\nof the morning and the whole of the afternoon in fidgeting about from\r\nroom to room, watching the clouds, cursing the rain, alternately\r\npetting and teasing and abusing his dogs, sometimes lounging on the\r\nsofa with a book that he could not force himself to read, and very\r\noften fixedly gazing at me when he thought I did not perceive it, with\r\nthe vain hope of detecting some traces of tears, or some tokens of\r\nremorseful anguish in my face. But I managed to preserve an undisturbed\r\nthough grave serenity throughout the day. I was not really angry: I\r\nfelt for him all the time, and longed to be reconciled; but I\r\ndetermined he should make the first advances, or at least show some\r\nsigns of an humble and contrite spirit first; for, if I began, it would\r\nonly minister to his self-conceit, increase his arrogance, and quite\r\ndestroy the lesson I wanted to give him.\r\n\r\nHe made a long stay in the dining-room after dinner, and, I fear, took\r\nan unusual quantity of wine, but not enough to loosen his tongue: for\r\nwhen he came in and found me quietly occupied with my book, too busy to\r\nlift my head on his entrance, he merely murmured an expression of\r\nsuppressed disapprobation, and, shutting the door with a bang, went and\r\nstretched himself at full length on the sofa, and composed himself to\r\nsleep. But his favourite cocker, Dash, that had been lying at my feet,\r\ntook the liberty of jumping upon him and beginning to lick his face. He\r\nstruck it off with a smart blow, and the poor dog squeaked and ran\r\ncowering back to me. When he woke up, about half an hour after, he\r\ncalled it to him again, but Dash only looked sheepish and wagged the\r\ntip of his tail. He called again more sharply, but Dash only clung the\r\ncloser to me, and licked my hand, as if imploring protection. Enraged\r\nat this, his master snatched up a heavy book and hurled it at his head.\r\nThe poor dog set up a piteous outcry, and ran to the door. I let him\r\nout, and then quietly took up the book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive that book to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, in no very courteous tone. I gave\r\nit to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you let the dog out?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked; \xe2\x80\x9cyou knew I wanted him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what token?\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cby your throwing the book at him? but\r\nperhaps it was intended for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I see you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a taste of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking at my hand,\r\nthat had also been struck, and was rather severely grazed.\r\n\r\nI returned to my reading, and he endeavoured to occupy himself in the\r\nsame manner; but in a little while, after several portentous yawns, he\r\npronounced _his_ book to be \xe2\x80\x9ccursed trash,\xe2\x80\x9d and threw it on the table.\r\nThen followed eight or ten minutes of silence, during the greater part\r\nof which, I believe, he was staring at me. At last his patience was\r\ntired out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ that book, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it interesting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went on reading, or pretending to read, at least\xe2\x80\x94I cannot say there\r\nwas much communication between my eyes and my brain; for, while the\r\nformer ran over the pages, the latter was earnestly wondering when\r\nArthur would speak next, and what he would say, and what I should\r\nanswer. But he did not speak again till I rose to make the tea, and\r\nthen it was only to say he should not take any. He continued lounging\r\non the sofa, and alternately closing his eyes and looking at his watch\r\nand at me, till bed-time, when I rose, and took my candle and retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, the moment I had left the room. I turned back, and\r\nstood awaiting his commands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d I said at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went, but hearing him mutter something as I was closing the door, I\r\nturned again. It sounded very like \xe2\x80\x9cconfounded slut,\xe2\x80\x9d but I was quite\r\nwilling it should be something else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you speaking, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, and I shut the door and departed. I saw nothing\r\nmore of him till the following morning at breakfast, when he came down\r\na full hour after the usual time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very late,\xe2\x80\x9d was my morning\xe2\x80\x99s salutation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t have waited for me,\xe2\x80\x9d was his; and he walked up to the\r\nwindow again. It was just such weather as yesterday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, this confounded rain!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. But, after studiously\r\nregarding it for a minute or two, a bright idea, seemed to strike him,\r\nfor he suddenly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do!\xe2\x80\x9d and then returned\r\nand took his seat at the table. The letter-bag was already there,\r\nwaiting to be opened. He unlocked it and examined the contents, but\r\nsaid nothing about them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything for me?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened the newspaper and began to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better take your coffee,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested I; \xe2\x80\x9cit will be cold again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ve done; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose and withdrew to the next room, wondering if we were to have\r\nanother such miserable day as yesterday, and wishing intensely for an\r\nend of these mutually inflicted torments. Shortly after I heard him\r\nring the bell and give some orders about his wardrobe that sounded as\r\nif he meditated a long journey. He then sent for the coachman, and I\r\nheard something about the carriage and the horses, and London, and\r\nseven o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow morning, that startled and disturbed me not a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must not let him go to London, whatever comes of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to\r\nmyself; \xe2\x80\x9che will run into all kinds of mischief, and I shall be the\r\ncause of it. But the question is, How am I to alter his purpose? Well,\r\nI will wait awhile, and see if he mentions it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI waited most anxiously, from hour to hour; but not a word was spoken,\r\non that or any other subject, to me. He whistled and talked to his\r\ndogs, and wandered from room to room, much the same as on the previous\r\nday. At last I began to think I must introduce the subject myself, and\r\nwas pondering how to bring it about, when John unwittingly came to my\r\nrelief with the following message from the coachman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, Richard says one of the horses has got a very bad cold,\r\nand he thinks, sir, if you could make it convenient to go the day after\r\nto-morrow, instead of to-morrow, he could physic it to-day, so as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound his impudence!\xe2\x80\x9d interjected the master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, he says it would be a deal better if you could,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npersisted John, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he hopes there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a change in the weather\r\nshortly, and he says it\xe2\x80\x99s not _likely_, when a horse is so bad with a\r\ncold, and physicked and all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil take the horse!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, tell him I\xe2\x80\x99ll think\r\nabout it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection. He cast a searching\r\nglance at me, as the servant withdrew, expecting to see some token of\r\ndeep astonishment and alarm; but, being previously prepared, I\r\npreserved an aspect of stoical indifference. His countenance fell as he\r\nmet my steady gaze, and he turned away in very obvious disappointment,\r\nand walked up to the fire-place, where he stood in an attitude of\r\nundisguised dejection, leaning against the chimney-piece with his\r\nforehead sunk upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you want to go, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I cannot be happy here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause my wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would love you with all her heart, if you deserved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must I do to deserve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed humble and earnest enough; and I was so much affected,\r\nbetween sorrow and joy, that I was obliged to pause a few seconds\r\nbefore I could steady my voice to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she gives you her heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must take it, thankfully,\r\nand use it well, and not pull it in pieces, and laugh in her face,\r\nbecause she cannot snatch it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe now turned round, and stood facing me, with his back to the fire.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then, Helen, are you going to be a good girl?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nThis sounded rather too arrogant, and the smile that accompanied it did\r\nnot please me. I therefore hesitated to reply. Perhaps my former answer\r\nhad implied too much: he had heard my voice falter, and might have seen\r\nme brush away a tear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to forgive me, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, more humbly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre _you_ penitent?\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, stepping up to him and smiling in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeart-broken!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a rueful countenance, yet with a\r\nmerry smile just lurking within his eyes and about the corners of his\r\nmouth; but this could not repulse me, and I flew into his arms. He\r\nfervently embraced me, and though I shed a torrent of tears, I think I\r\nnever was happier in my life than at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t go to London, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, when the first transport\r\nof tears and kisses had subsided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, love,\xe2\x80\x94unless you will go with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, gladly,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cif you think the change will amuse you,\r\nand if you will put off the journey till next week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe readily consented, but said there was no need of much preparation,\r\nas he should not be for staying long, for he did not wish me to be\r\nLondonized, and to lose my country freshness and originality by too\r\nmuch intercourse with the ladies of the world. I thought this folly;\r\nbut I did not wish to contradict him now: I merely said that I was of\r\nvery domestic habits, as he well knew, and had no particular wish to\r\nmingle with the world.\r\n\r\nSo we are to go to London on Monday, the day after to-morrow. It is now\r\nfour days since the termination of our quarrel, and I am sure it has\r\ndone us both good: it has made me like Arthur a great deal better, and\r\nmade him behave a great deal better to me. He has never once attempted\r\nto annoy me since, by the most distant allusion to Lady F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, or any of\r\nthose disagreeable reminiscences of his former life. I wish I could\r\nblot them from my memory, or else get him to regard such matters in the\r\nsame light as I do. Well! it is something, however, to have made him\r\nsee that they are not fit subjects for a conjugal jest. He may see\r\nfurther some time. I will put no limits to my hopes; and, in spite of\r\nmy aunt\xe2\x80\x99s forebodings and my own unspoken fears, I trust we shall be\r\nhappy yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of April we went to London, on the eighth of May I\r\nreturned, in obedience to Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s wish; very much against my own,\r\nbecause I left him behind. If he had come with me, I should have been\r\nvery glad to get home again, for he led me such a round of restless\r\ndissipation while there, that, in that short space of time, I was quite\r\ntired out. He seemed bent upon displaying me to his friends and\r\nacquaintances in particular, and the public in general, on every\r\npossible occasion, and to the greatest possible advantage. It was\r\nsomething to feel that he considered me a worthy object of pride; but I\r\npaid dear for the gratification: for, in the first place, to please him\r\nI had to violate my cherished predilections, my almost rooted\r\nprinciples in favour of a plain, dark, sober style of dress\xe2\x80\x94I must\r\nsparkle in costly jewels and deck myself out like a painted butterfly,\r\njust as I had, long since, determined I would never do\xe2\x80\x94and this was no\r\ntrifling sacrifice; in the second place, I was continually straining to\r\nsatisfy his sanguine expectations and do honour to his choice by my\r\ngeneral conduct and deportment, and fearing to disappoint him by some\r\nawkward misdemeanour, or some trait of inexperienced ignorance about\r\nthe customs of society, especially when I acted the part of hostess,\r\nwhich I was not unfrequently called upon to do; and, in the third\r\nplace, as I intimated before, I was wearied of the throng and bustle,\r\nthe restless hurry and ceaseless change of a life so alien to all my\r\nprevious habits. At last, he suddenly discovered that the London air\r\ndid not agree with me, and I was languishing for my country home, and\r\nmust immediately return to Grassdale.\r\n\r\nI laughingly assured him that the case was not so urgent as he appeared\r\nto think it, but I was quite willing to go home if he was. He replied\r\nthat he should be obliged to remain a week or two longer, as he had\r\nbusiness that required his presence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will stay with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t do with you, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer: \xe2\x80\x9cas long as you stay\r\nI shall attend to you and neglect my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned; \xe2\x80\x9cnow that I know you have business\r\nto attend to, I shall insist upon your attending to it, and letting me\r\nalone; and, to tell the truth, I shall be glad of a little rest. I can\r\ntake my rides and walks in the Park as usual; and your business cannot\r\noccupy all your time: I shall see you at meal-times, and in the\r\nevenings at least, and that will be better than being leagues away and\r\nnever seeing you at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my love, I cannot let you stay. How can I settle my affairs when\r\nI know that you are here, neglected\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not feel myself neglected: while you are doing your duty,\r\nArthur, I shall never complain of neglect. If you had told me before,\r\nthat you had anything to do, it would have been half done before this;\r\nand now you must make up for lost time by redoubled exertions. Tell me\r\nwhat it is; and I will be your taskmaster, instead of being a\r\nhindrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the impracticable creature; \xe2\x80\x9cyou _must_ go home,\r\nHelen; I must have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe and\r\nwell, though far away. Your bright eyes are faded, and that tender,\r\ndelicate bloom has quite deserted your cheek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is only with too much gaiety and fatigue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not, I tell you; it is the London air: you are pining for the\r\nfresh breezes of your country home, and you shall feel them before you\r\nare two days older. And remember your situation, dearest Helen; on your\r\nhealth, you know, depends the health, if not the life, of our future\r\nhope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you really wish to get rid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPositively, I do; and I will take you down myself to Grassdale, and\r\nthen return. I shall not be absent above a week or fortnight at most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I must go, I will go alone: if you must stay, it is needless to\r\nwaste your time in the journey there and back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he did not like the idea of sending me alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what helpless creature do you take me for,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\ncannot trust me to go a hundred miles in our own carriage, with our own\r\nfootman and a maid to attend me? If you come with me I shall assuredly\r\nkeep you. But tell me, Arthur, what _is_ this tiresome business; and\r\nwhy did you never mention it before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only a little business with my lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and he told me\r\nsomething about a piece of property he wanted to sell, in order to pay\r\noff a part of the incumbrances on his estate; but either the account\r\nwas a little confused, or I was rather dull of comprehension, for I\r\ncould not clearly understand how that should keep him in town a\r\nfortnight after me. Still less can I now comprehend how it should keep\r\nhim a month, for it is nearly that time since I left him, and no signs\r\nof his return as yet. In every letter he promises to be with me in a\r\nfew days, and every time deceives me, or deceives himself. His excuses\r\nare vague and insufficient. I cannot doubt that he has got among his\r\nformer companions again. Oh, why did I leave him! I wish\xe2\x80\x94I do intensely\r\nwish he would return!\r\n\r\nJune 29th.\xe2\x80\x94No Arthur yet; and for many days I have been looking and\r\nlonging in vain for a letter. His letters, when they come, are kind, if\r\nfair words and endearing epithets can give them a claim to the\r\ntitle\xe2\x80\x94but very short, and full of trivial excuses and promises that I\r\ncannot trust; and yet how anxiously I look forward to them! how eagerly\r\nI open and devour one of those little, hastily-scribbled returns for\r\nthe three or four long letters, hitherto unanswered, he has had from\r\nme!\r\n\r\nOh, it is cruel to leave me so long alone! He knows I have no one but\r\nRachel to speak to, for we have no neighbours here, except the\r\nHargraves, whose residence I can dimly descry from these upper windows\r\nembosomed among those low, woody hills beyond the Dale. I was glad when\r\nI learnt that Milicent was so near us; and her company would be a\r\nsoothing solace to me now; but she is still in town with her mother;\r\nthere is no one at the Grove but little Esther and her French\r\ngoverness, for Walter is always away. I saw that paragon of manly\r\nperfections in London: he seemed scarcely to merit the eulogiums of his\r\nmother and sister, though he certainly appeared more conversable and\r\nagreeable than Lord Lowborough, more candid and high-minded than Mr.\r\nGrimsby, and more polished and gentlemanly than Mr. Hattersley,\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s only other friend whom he judged fit to introduce to me.\xe2\x80\x94Oh,\r\nArthur, why won\xe2\x80\x99t you come? why won\xe2\x80\x99t you write to me at least? You\r\ntalked about my health: how can you expect me to gather bloom and\r\nvigour here, pining in solitude and restless anxiety from day to\r\nday?\xe2\x80\x94It would serve you right to come back and find my good looks\r\nentirely wasted away. I would beg my uncle and aunt, or my brother, to\r\ncome and see me, but I do not like to complain of my loneliness to\r\nthem, and indeed loneliness is the least of my sufferings. But what is\r\nhe doing\xe2\x80\x94what is it that keeps him away? It is this ever-recurring\r\nquestion, and the horrible suggestions it raises, that distract me.\r\n\r\nJuly 3rd.\xe2\x80\x94My last bitter letter has wrung from him an answer at last,\r\nand a rather longer one than usual; but still I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make\r\nof it. He playfully abuses me for the gall and vinegar of my latest\r\neffusion, tells me I can have no conception of the multitudinous\r\nengagements that keep him away, but avers that, in spite of them all,\r\nhe will assuredly be with me before the close of next week; though it\r\nis impossible for a man so circumstanced as he is to fix the precise\r\nday of his return: meantime he exhorts me to the exercise of patience,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat first of woman\xe2\x80\x99s virtues,\xe2\x80\x9d and desires me to remember the saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsence makes the heart grow fonder,\xe2\x80\x9d and comfort myself with the\r\nassurance that the longer he stays away the better he shall love me\r\nwhen he returns; and till he does return, he begs I will continue to\r\nwrite to him constantly, for, though he is sometimes too idle and often\r\ntoo busy to answer my letters as they come, he likes to receive them\r\ndaily; and if I fulfil my threat of punishing his seeming neglect by\r\nceasing to write, he shall be so angry that he will do his utmost to\r\nforget me. He adds this piece of intelligence respecting poor Milicent\r\nHargrave:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour little friend Milicent is likely, before long, to follow your\r\nexample, and take upon her the yoke of matrimony in conjunction with a\r\nfriend of mine. Hattersley, you know, has not yet fulfilled his direful\r\nthreat of throwing his precious person away on the first old maid that\r\nchose to evince a tenderness for him; but he still preserves a resolute\r\ndetermination to see himself a married man before the year is out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to me, \xe2\x80\x98I must have somebody that will let me have my\r\nown way in everything\xe2\x80\x94not like _your_ wife, Huntingdon: she is a\r\ncharming creature, but she looks as if she had a will of her own, and\r\ncould play the vixen upon occasion\xe2\x80\x99 (I thought \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re right there,\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x99 but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so). \xe2\x80\x98I must have some good, quiet soul that\r\nwill let me just do what I like and go where I like, keep at home or\r\nstay away, without a word of reproach or complaint; for I can\xe2\x80\x99t do with\r\nbeing bothered.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I know somebody that will suit you to\r\na tee, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for money, and that\xe2\x80\x99s Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\r\nMilicent.\xe2\x80\x99 He desired to be introduced to her forthwith, for he said he\r\nhad plenty of the needful himself, or should have when his old governor\r\nchose to quit the stage. So you see, Helen, I have managed pretty well,\r\nboth for your friend and mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Milicent! But I cannot imagine she will ever be led to accept such\r\na suitor\xe2\x80\x94one so repugnant to all her ideas of a man to be honoured and\r\nloved.\r\n\r\n5th.\xe2\x80\x94Alas! I was mistaken. I have got a long letter from her this\r\nmorning, telling me she is already engaged, and expects to be married\r\nbefore the close of the month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know what to say about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes, \xe2\x80\x9cor what to think. To\r\ntell you the truth, Helen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the thoughts of it at all. If I\r\n_am_ to be Mr. Hattersley\xe2\x80\x99s wife, I must try to love him; and I do try\r\nwith all my might; but I have made very little progress yet; and the\r\nworst symptom of the case is, that the further he is from me the better\r\nI like him: he frightens me with his abrupt manners and strange\r\nhectoring ways, and I dread the thoughts of marrying him. \xe2\x80\x98Then why\r\nhave you accepted him?\xe2\x80\x99 you will ask; and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I had accepted\r\nhim; but mamma tells me I have, and he seems to think so too. I\r\ncertainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do so; but I did not like to give him a flat\r\nrefusal, for fear mamma should be grieved and angry (for I knew she\r\nwished me to marry him), and I wanted to talk to her first about it: so\r\nI gave him what _I_ thought was an evasive, half negative answer; but\r\nshe says it was as good as an acceptance, and he would think me very\r\ncapricious if I were to attempt to draw back\xe2\x80\x94and indeed I was so\r\nconfused and frightened at the moment, I can hardly tell what I said.\r\nAnd next time I saw him, he accosted me in all confidence as his\r\naffianced bride, and immediately began to settle matters with mamma. I\r\nhad not courage to contradict them then, and how can I do it now? I\r\ncannot; they would think me mad. Besides, mamma is so delighted with\r\nthe idea of the match; she thinks she has managed so well for me; and I\r\ncannot bear to disappoint her. I do object sometimes, and tell her what\r\nI feel, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know _how_ she talks. Mr. Hattersley, you know,\r\nis the son of a rich banker, and as Esther and I have no fortunes, and\r\nWalter very little, our dear mamma is very anxious to see us all well\r\nmarried, that is, united to rich partners. It is not _my_ idea of being\r\nwell married, but she means it all for the best. She says when I am\r\nsafe off her hands it will be such a relief to her mind; and she\r\nassures me it will be a good thing for the family as well as for me.\r\nEven Walter is pleased at the prospect, and when I confessed my\r\nreluctance to him, he said it was all childish nonsense. Do _you_ think\r\nit nonsense, Helen? I should not care if I could see any prospect of\r\nbeing able to love and admire him, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t. There is nothing about\r\nhim to hang one\xe2\x80\x99s esteem and affection upon; he is so diametrically\r\nopposite to what I imagined my husband should be. Do write to me, and\r\nsay all you can to encourage me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to dissuade me, for my\r\nfate is fixed: preparations for the important event are already going\r\non around me; and don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word against Mr. Hattersley, for I want\r\nto think well of him; and though I have spoken against him myself, it\r\nis for the last time: hereafter, I shall never permit myself to utter a\r\nword in his dispraise, however he may seem to deserve it; and whoever\r\nventures to speak slightingly of the man I have promised to love, to\r\nhonour, and obey, must expect my serious displeasure. After all, I\r\nthink he is quite as good as Mr. Huntingdon, if not better; and yet you\r\nlove _him_, and seem to be happy and contented; and perhaps I may\r\nmanage as well. You must tell me, if you can, that Mr. Hattersley is\r\nbetter than he seems\xe2\x80\x94that he is upright, honourable, and\r\nopen-hearted\xe2\x80\x94in fact, a perfect diamond in the rough. He may be all\r\nthis, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him. I know only the exterior, and what, I\r\ntrust, is the worst part of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe concludes with \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, dear Helen. I am waiting anxiously for\r\nyour advice\xe2\x80\x94but mind you let it be all on the right side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlas! poor Milicent, what encouragement can I give you? or what\r\nadvice\xe2\x80\x94except that it is better to make a bold stand now, though at the\r\nexpense of disappointing and angering both mother and brother and\r\nlover, than to devote your whole life, hereafter, to misery and vain\r\nregret?\r\n\r\nSaturday, 13th.\xe2\x80\x94The week is over, and he is not come. All the sweet\r\nsummer is passing away without one breath of pleasure to me or benefit\r\nto him. And I had all along been looking forward to this season with\r\nthe fond, delusive hope that we should enjoy it so sweetly together;\r\nand that, with God\xe2\x80\x99s help and my exertions, it would be the means of\r\nelevating his mind, and refining his taste to a due appreciation of the\r\nsalutary and pure delights of nature, and peace, and holy love. But\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94at evening, when I see the round red sun sink quietly down behind\r\nthose woody hills, leaving them sleeping in a warm, red, golden haze, I\r\nonly think another lovely day is lost to him and me; and at morning,\r\nwhen roused by the flutter and chirp of the sparrows, and the gleeful\r\ntwitter of the swallows\xe2\x80\x94all intent upon feeding their young, and full\r\nof life and joy in their own little frames\xe2\x80\x94I open the window to inhale\r\nthe balmy, soul-reviving air, and look out upon the lovely landscape,\r\nlaughing in dew and sunshine\xe2\x80\x94I too often shame that glorious scene with\r\ntears of thankless misery, because _he_ cannot feel its freshening\r\ninfluence; and when I wander in the ancient woods, and meet the little\r\nwild flowers smiling in my path, or sit in the shadow of our noble\r\nash-trees by the water-side, with their branches gently swaying in the\r\nlight summer breeze that murmurs through their feathery foliage\xe2\x80\x94my ears\r\nfull of that low music mingled with the dreamy hum of insects, my eyes\r\nabstractedly gazing on the glassy surface of the little lake before me,\r\nwith the trees that crowd about its bank, some gracefully bending to\r\nkiss its waters, some rearing their stately heads high above, but\r\nstretching their wide arms over its margin, all faithfully mirrored\r\nfar, far down in its glassy depth\xe2\x80\x94though sometimes the images are\r\npartially broken by the sport of aquatic insects, and sometimes, for a\r\nmoment, the whole is shivered into trembling fragments by a transient\r\nbreeze that sweeps the surface too roughly\xe2\x80\x94still I have no pleasure;\r\nfor the greater the happiness that nature sets before me, the more I\r\nlament that _he_ is not here to taste it: the greater the bliss we\r\nmight enjoy together, the more I feel our present wretchedness apart\r\n(yes, ours; he must be wretched, though he may not know it); and the\r\nmore my senses are pleased, the more my heart is oppressed; for he\r\nkeeps it with him confined amid the dust and smoke of London\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\nshut up within the walls of his own abominable club.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, at night, when I enter my lonely chamber, and look out\r\nupon the summer moon, \xe2\x80\x9csweet regent of the sky,\xe2\x80\x9d floating above me in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cblack blue vault of heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d shedding a flood of silver radiance\r\nover park, and wood, and water, so pure, so peaceful, so divine\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthink, Where is he now?\xe2\x80\x94what is he doing at this moment? wholly\r\nunconscious of this heavenly scene\xe2\x80\x94perhaps revelling with his boon\r\ncompanions, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94God help me, it is too\xe2\x80\x94_too_ much!\r\n\r\n23rd.\xe2\x80\x94Thank heaven, he is come at last! But how altered! flushed and\r\nfeverish, listless and languid, his beauty strangely diminished, his\r\nvigour and vivacity quite departed. I have not upbraided him by word or\r\nlook; I have not even asked him what he has been doing. I have not the\r\nheart to do it, for I think he is ashamed of himself\xe2\x80\x94he must be so\r\nindeed, and such inquiries could not fail to be painful to both. My\r\nforbearance pleases him\xe2\x80\x94touches him even, I am inclined to think. He\r\nsays he is glad to be home again, and God knows how glad I am to get\r\nhim back, even as he is. He lies on the sofa, nearly all day long; and\r\nI play and sing to him for hours together. I write his letters for him,\r\nand get him everything he wants; and sometimes I read to him, and\r\nsometimes I talk, and sometimes only sit by him and soothe him with\r\nsilent caresses. I know he does not deserve it; and I fear I am\r\nspoiling him; but this once, I will forgive him, freely and entirely. I\r\nwill shame him into virtue if I can, and I will never let him leave me\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHe is pleased with my attentions\xe2\x80\x94it may be, grateful for them. He likes\r\nto have me near him: and though he is peevish and testy with his\r\nservants and his dogs, he is gentle and kind to me. What he would be,\r\nif I did not so watchfully anticipate his wants, and so carefully\r\navoid, or immediately desist from doing anything that has a tendency to\r\nirritate or disturb him, with however little reason, I cannot tell. How\r\nintensely I wish he were worthy of all this care! Last night, as I sat\r\nbeside him, with his head in my lap, passing my fingers through his\r\nbeautiful curls, this thought made my eyes overflow with sorrowful\r\ntears\xe2\x80\x94as it often does; but this time, a tear fell on his face and made\r\nhim look up. He smiled, but not insultingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you cry? you know that I love you\xe2\x80\x9d (and\r\nhe pressed my hand to his feverish lips), \xe2\x80\x9cand what more could you\r\ndesire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly, Arthur, that you would love _yourself_ as truly and as\r\nfaithfully as you are loved by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be hard, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, tenderly squeezing my hand.\r\n\r\nAugust 24th.\xe2\x80\x94Arthur is himself again, as lusty and reckless, as light\r\nof heart and head as ever, and as restless and hard to amuse as a\r\nspoilt child, and almost as full of mischief too, especially when wet\r\nweather keeps him within doors. I wish he had something to do, some\r\nuseful trade, or profession, or employment\xe2\x80\x94anything to occupy his head\r\nor his hands for a few hours a day, and give him something besides his\r\nown pleasure to think about. If he would play the country gentleman and\r\nattend to the farm\xe2\x80\x94but that he knows nothing about, and won\xe2\x80\x99t give his\r\nmind to consider,\xe2\x80\x94or if he would take up with some literary study, or\r\nlearn to draw or to play\xe2\x80\x94as he is so fond of music, I often try to\r\npersuade him to learn the piano, but he is far too idle for such an\r\nundertaking: he has no more idea of exerting himself to overcome\r\nobstacles than he has of restraining his natural appetites; and these\r\ntwo things are the ruin of him. I lay them both to the charge of his\r\nharsh yet careless father, and his madly indulgent mother.\xe2\x80\x94If ever I am\r\na mother I will zealously strive against this _crime_ of\r\nover-indulgence. I can hardly give it a milder name when I think of the\r\nevils it brings.\r\n\r\nHappily, it will soon be the shooting season, and then, if the weather\r\npermit, he will find occupation enough in the pursuit and destruction\r\nof the partridges and pheasants: we have no grouse, or he might have\r\nbeen similarly occupied at this moment, instead of lying under the\r\nacacia-tree pulling poor Dash\xe2\x80\x99s ears. But he says it is dull work\r\nshooting alone; he must have a friend or two to help him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them be tolerably decent then, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. The word \xe2\x80\x9cfriend\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin his mouth makes me shudder: I know it was some of his \xe2\x80\x9cfriends\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\ninduced him to stay behind me in London, and kept him away so long:\r\nindeed, from what he has unguardedly told me, or hinted from time to\r\ntime, I cannot doubt that he frequently showed them my letters, to let\r\nthem see how fondly his wife watched over his interests, and how keenly\r\nshe regretted his absence; and that they induced him to remain week\r\nafter week, and to plunge into all manner of excesses, to avoid being\r\nlaughed at for a wife-ridden fool, and, perhaps, to show how far he\r\ncould venture to go without danger of shaking the fond creature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndevoted attachment. It is a hateful idea, but I cannot believe it is a\r\nfalse one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought of Lord Lowborough for one; but there is\r\nno possibility of getting him without his better half, our mutual\r\nfriend, Annabella; so we must ask them both. You\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid of her,\r\nare you, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered: \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should I? And who besides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHargrave for one. He will be glad to come, though his own place is so\r\nnear, for he has little enough land of his own to shoot over, and we\r\ncan extend our depredations into it, if we like; and he is thoroughly\r\nrespectable, you know, Helen\xe2\x80\x94quite a lady\xe2\x80\x99s man: and I think, Grimsby\r\nfor another: he\xe2\x80\x99s a decent, quiet fellow enough. You\xe2\x80\x99ll not object to\r\nGrimsby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate him: but, however, if you wish it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to endure his\r\npresence for a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll a prejudice, Helen, a mere woman\xe2\x80\x99s antipathy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have solid grounds for my dislike. And is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, I think so. Hattersley will be too busy billing and cooing,\r\nwith his bride to have much time to spare for guns and dogs at\r\npresent,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. And that reminds me, that I have had several\r\nletters from Milicent since her marriage, and that she either is, or\r\npretends to be, quite reconciled to her lot. She professes to have\r\ndiscovered numberless virtues and perfections in her husband, some of\r\nwhich, I fear, less partial eyes would fail to distinguish, though they\r\nsought them carefully with tears; and now that she is accustomed to his\r\nloud voice, and abrupt, uncourteous manners, she affirms she finds no\r\ndifficulty in loving him as a wife should do, and begs I will burn that\r\nletter wherein she spoke so unadvisedly against him. So that I trust\r\nshe may yet be happy; but, if she is, it will be entirely the reward of\r\nher own goodness of heart; for had she chosen to consider herself the\r\nvictim of fate, or of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s worldly wisdom, she might have been\r\nthoroughly miserable; and if, for duty\xe2\x80\x99s sake, she had not made every\r\neffort to love her husband, she would, doubtless, have hated him to the\r\nend of her days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nSept. 23rd.\xe2\x80\x94Our guests arrived about three weeks ago. Lord and Lady\r\nLowborough have now been married above eight months; and I will do the\r\nlady the credit to say that her husband is quite an altered man; his\r\nlooks, his spirits, and his temper, are all perceptibly changed for the\r\nbetter since I last saw him. But there is room for improvement still.\r\nHe is not always cheerful, nor always contented, and she often\r\ncomplains of his ill-humour, which, however, of all persons, _she_\r\nought to be the last to accuse him of, as he never displays it against\r\nher, except for such conduct as would provoke a saint. He adores her\r\nstill, and would go to the world\xe2\x80\x99s end to please her. She knows her\r\npower, and she uses it too; but well knowing that to wheedle and coax\r\nis safer than to command, she judiciously tempers her despotism with\r\nflattery and blandishments enough to make him deem himself a favoured\r\nand a happy man.\r\n\r\nBut she has a way of tormenting him, in which I am a fellow-sufferer,\r\nor might be, if I chose to regard myself as such. This is by openly,\r\nbut not too glaringly, coquetting with Mr. Huntingdon, who is quite\r\nwilling to be her partner in the game; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for it,\r\nbecause, with him, I know there is nothing but personal vanity, and a\r\nmischievous desire to excite my jealousy, and, perhaps, to torment his\r\nfriend; and she, no doubt, is actuated by much the same motives; only,\r\nthere is more of malice and less of playfulness in _her_ man\xc5\x93uvres. It\r\nis obviously, therefore, my interest to disappoint them both, as far as\r\nI am concerned, by preserving a cheerful, undisturbed serenity\r\nthroughout; and, accordingly, I endeavour to show the fullest\r\nconfidence in my husband, and the greatest indifference to the arts of\r\nmy attractive guest. I have never reproached the former but once, and\r\nthat was for laughing at Lord Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s depressed and anxious\r\ncountenance one evening, when they had both been particularly\r\nprovoking; and then, indeed, I said a good deal on the subject, and\r\nrebuked him sternly enough; but he only laughed, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\nfeel for him, Helen, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can feel for anyone that is unjustly treated,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand I can\r\nfeel for those that injure them too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Helen, you are as jealous as he is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, laughing still\r\nmore; and I found it impossible to convince him of his mistake. So,\r\nfrom that time, I have carefully refrained from any notice of the\r\nsubject whatever, and left Lord Lowborough to take care of himself. He\r\neither has not the sense or the power to follow my example, though he\r\ndoes try to conceal his uneasiness as well as he can; but still, it\r\nwill appear in his face, and his ill-humour will peep out at intervals,\r\nthough not in the expression of open resentment\xe2\x80\x94they never go far\r\nenough for that. But I confess I do feel jealous at times, most\r\npainfully, bitterly so; when she sings and plays to him, and he hangs\r\nover the instrument, and dwells upon her voice with no affected\r\ninterest; for then I know he is really delighted, and I have no power\r\nto awaken similar fervour. I can amuse and please him with my simple\r\nsongs, but not delight him thus.\r\n\r\n28th.\xe2\x80\x94Yesterday, we all went to the Grove, Mr. Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmuch-neglected home. His mother frequently asks us over, that she may\r\nhave the pleasure of her dear Walter\xe2\x80\x99s company; and this time she had\r\ninvited us to a dinner-party, and got together as many of the country\r\ngentry as were within reach to meet us. The entertainment was very well\r\ngot up; but I could not help thinking about the cost of it all the\r\ntime. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like Mrs. Hargrave; she is a hard, pretentious,\r\nworldly-minded woman. She has money enough to live very comfortably, if\r\nshe only knew how to use it judiciously, and had taught her son to do\r\nthe same; but she is ever straining to keep up appearances, with that\r\ndespicable pride that shuns the semblance of poverty as of a shameful\r\ncrime. She grinds her dependents, pinches her servants, and deprives\r\neven her daughters and herself of the real comforts of life, because\r\nshe will not consent to yield the palm in outward show to those who\r\nhave three times her wealth; and, above all, because she is determined\r\nher cherished son shall be enabled to \xe2\x80\x9chold up his head with the\r\nhighest gentlemen in the land.\xe2\x80\x9d This same son, I imagine, is a man of\r\nexpensive habits, no reckless spendthrift and no abandoned sensualist,\r\nbut one who likes to have \xe2\x80\x9ceverything handsome about him,\xe2\x80\x9d and to go to\r\na certain length in youthful indulgences, not so much to gratify his\r\nown tastes as to maintain his reputation as a man of fashion in the\r\nworld, and a respectable fellow among his own lawless companions; while\r\nhe is too selfish to consider how many comforts might be obtained for\r\nhis fond mother and sisters with the money he thus wastes upon himself:\r\nas long as they can contrive to make a respectable appearance once a\r\nyear, when they come to town, he gives himself little concern about\r\ntheir private stintings and struggles at home. This is a harsh judgment\r\nto form of \xe2\x80\x9cdear, noble-minded, generous-hearted Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d but I fear it\r\nis too just.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety to make good matches for her daughters is\r\npartly the cause, and partly the result, of these errors: by making a\r\nfigure in the world, and showing them off to advantage, she hopes to\r\nobtain better chances for them; and by thus living beyond her\r\nlegitimate means, and lavishing so much on their brother, she renders\r\nthem portionless, and makes them burdens on her hands. Poor Milicent, I\r\nfear, has already fallen a sacrifice to the man\xc5\x93uvrings of this\r\nmistaken mother, who congratulates herself on having so satisfactorily\r\ndischarged her maternal duty, and hopes to do as well for Esther. But\r\nEsther is a child as yet, a little merry romp of fourteen: as\r\nhonest-hearted, and as guileless and simple as her sister, but with a\r\nfearless spirit of her own, that I fancy her mother will find some\r\ndifficulty in bending to her purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 9th.\xe2\x80\x94It was on the night of the 4th, a little after tea, that\r\nAnnabella had been singing and playing, with Arthur as usual at her\r\nside: she had ended her song, but still she sat at the instrument; and\r\nhe stood leaning on the back of her chair, conversing in scarcely\r\naudible tones, with his face in very close proximity with hers. I\r\nlooked at Lord Lowborough. He was at the other end of the room, talking\r\nwith Messrs. Hargrave and Grimsby; but I saw him dart towards his lady\r\nand his host a quick, impatient glance, expressive of intense\r\ndisquietude, at which Grimsby smiled. Determined to interrupt the\r\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_, I rose, and, selecting a piece of music from the music\r\nstand, stepped up to the piano, intending to ask the lady to play it;\r\nbut I stood transfixed and speechless on seeing her seated there,\r\nlistening, with what seemed an exultant smile on her flushed face to\r\nhis soft murmurings, with her hand quietly surrendered to his clasp.\r\nThe blood rushed first to my heart, and then to my head; for there was\r\nmore than this: almost at the moment of my approach, he cast a hurried\r\nglance over his shoulder towards the other occupants of the room, and\r\nthen ardently pressed the unresisting hand to his lips. On raising his\r\neyes, he beheld me, and dropped them again, confounded and dismayed.\r\nShe saw me too, and confronted me with a look of hard defiance. I laid\r\nthe music on the piano, and retired. I felt ill; but I did not leave\r\nthe room: happily, it was getting late, and could not be long before\r\nthe company dispersed.\r\n\r\nI went to the fire, and leant my head against the chimney-piece. In a\r\nminute or two, some one asked me if I felt unwell. I did not answer;\r\nindeed, at the time, I knew not what was said; but I mechanically\r\nlooked up, and saw Mr. Hargrave standing beside me on the rug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I get you a glass of wine?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; and, turning from him, I looked round. Lady\r\nLowborough was beside her husband, bending over him as he sat, with her\r\nhand on his shoulder, softly talking and smiling in his face; and\r\nArthur was at the table, turning over a book of engravings. I seated\r\nmyself in the nearest chair; and Mr. Hargrave, finding his services\r\nwere not desired, judiciously withdrew. Shortly after, the company\r\nbroke up, and, as the guests were retiring to their rooms, Arthur\r\napproached me, smiling with the utmost assurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you _very_ angry, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no jest, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, seriously, but as calmly as I\r\ncould\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cunless you think it a jest to lose my affection for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! so bitter?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, laughingly, clasping my hand between\r\nboth his; but I snatched it away, in indignation\xe2\x80\x94almost in disgust, for\r\nhe was obviously affected with wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must go down on my knees,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and kneeling before me,\r\nwith clasped hands, uplifted in mock humiliation, he continued\r\nimploringly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Helen\xe2\x80\x94dear Helen, forgive me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll _never_\r\ndo it again!\xe2\x80\x9d and, burying his face in his handkerchief, he affected to\r\nsob aloud.\r\n\r\nLeaving him thus employed, I took my candle, and, slipping quietly from\r\nthe room, hastened up-stairs as fast as I could. But he soon discovered\r\nthat I had left him, and, rushing up after me, caught me in his arms,\r\njust as I had entered the chamber, and was about to shut the door in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, by heaven, you sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t escape me so!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. Then, alarmed\r\nat my agitation, he begged me not to put myself in such a passion,\r\ntelling me I was white in the face, and should kill myself if I did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured; and immediately he released me\xe2\x80\x94and it\r\nwas well he did, for I was really in a passion. I sank into the\r\neasy-chair and endeavoured to compose myself, for I wanted to speak to\r\nhim calmly. He stood beside me, but did not venture to touch me or to\r\nspeak for a few seconds; then, approaching a little nearer, he dropped\r\non one knee\xe2\x80\x94not in mock humility, but to bring himself nearer my level,\r\nand leaning his hand on the arm of the chair, he began in a low voice:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all nonsense, Helen\xe2\x80\x94a jest, a mere nothing\xe2\x80\x94not worth a thought.\r\nWill you _never_ learn,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued more boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have\r\nnothing to fear from me? that I love you wholly and entirely?\xe2\x80\x94or if,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added with a lurking smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI ever give a thought to another, you\r\nmay well spare it, for those fancies are here and gone like a flash of\r\nlightning, while my love for you burns on steadily, and for ever, like\r\nthe sun. You little exorbitant tyrant, will not _that_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet a moment, will you, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand listen to me\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m in a jealous fury: I am perfectly calm. Feel my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd I gravely extended it towards him\xe2\x80\x94but closed it upon his with an\r\nenergy that seemed to disprove the assertion, and made him smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t smile, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, still tightening my grasp, and looking\r\nsteadfastly on him till he almost quailed before me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may think it\r\nall very fine, Mr. Huntingdon, to amuse yourself with rousing my\r\njealousy; but take care you don\xe2\x80\x99t rouse my hate instead. And when you\r\nhave once extinguished my love, you will find it no easy matter to\r\nkindle it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Helen, I won\xe2\x80\x99t repeat the offence. But I meant nothing by it, I\r\nassure you. I had taken too much wine, and I was scarcely myself at the\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou often take too much; and that is another practice I detest.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlooked up astonished at my warmth. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\nmentioned it before, because I was ashamed to do so; but now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou that it distresses me, and may disgust me, if you go on and suffer\r\nthe habit to grow upon you, as it will if you don\xe2\x80\x99t check it in time.\r\nBut the whole system of your conduct to Lady Lowborough is not\r\nreferable to wine; and this night you knew perfectly well what you were\r\ndoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, with more of sulkiness than\r\ncontrition: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat more would you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sorry that I saw you, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had not seen me,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, fixing his eyes on the carpet,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit would have done no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart felt ready to burst; but I resolutely swallowed back my\r\nemotion, and answered calmly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, boldly. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, what have I done? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94except as you choose to make it a subject of accusation and\r\ndistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would Lord Lowborough, your _friend_, think, if he knew all? or\r\nwhat would you yourself think, if he or any other had acted the same\r\npart to me, throughout, as you have to Annabella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would blow his brains out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Arthur, how can you call it nothing\xe2\x80\x94an offence for which\r\nyou would think yourself justified in blowing another man\xe2\x80\x99s brains out?\r\nIs it nothing to trifle with your friend\xe2\x80\x99s feelings and mine\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nendeavour to steal a woman\xe2\x80\x99s affections from her husband\xe2\x80\x94what he values\r\nmore than his gold, and therefore what it is more dishonest to take?\r\nAre the marriage vows a jest; and is it nothing to make it your sport\r\nto break them, and to tempt another to do the same? Can I love a man\r\nthat does such things, and coolly maintains it is nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are breaking your marriage vows yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, indignantly\r\nrising and pacing to and fro. \xe2\x80\x9cYou promised to honour and obey me, and\r\nnow you attempt to hector over me, and threaten and accuse me, and call\r\nme worse than a highwayman. If it were not for your situation, Helen, I\r\nwould not submit to it so tamely. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be dictated to by a woman,\r\nthough she be my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do then? Will you go on till I hate you, and then accuse\r\nme of breaking my vows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent a moment, and then replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou never will hate me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nReturning and resuming his former position at my feet, he repeated more\r\nvehemently\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot hate me as long as I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I believe that you love me, if you continue to act in this\r\nway? Just imagine yourself in my place: would _you_ think I loved\r\n_you_, if _I_ did so? Would you believe my protestations, and honour\r\nand trust me under such circumstances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cases are different,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature to be\r\nconstant\xe2\x80\x94to love one and one only, blindly, tenderly, and for\r\never\xe2\x80\x94bless them, dear creatures! and you above them all; but you must\r\nhave some commiseration for us, Helen; you must give us a little more\r\nlicence, for, as Shakespeare has it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHowever we do praise ourselves,\r\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\r\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and won\r\nThan women\xe2\x80\x99s are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean by that, that your fancies are lost to me, and won by Lady\r\nLowborough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! heaven is my witness that I think her mere dust and ashes in\r\ncomparison with you, and shall continue to think so, unless you drive\r\nme from you by too much severity. She is a daughter of earth; you are\r\nan angel of heaven; only be not too austere in your divinity, and\r\nremember that I am a poor, fallible mortal. Come now, Helen; won\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nforgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gently taking my hand, and looking up with an\r\ninnocent smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do, you will repeat the offence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear by\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t swear; I\xe2\x80\x99ll believe your word as well as your oath. I wish I\r\ncould have confidence in either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry me, then, Helen: only trust and pardon me this once, and you shall\r\nsee! Come, I am in hell\xe2\x80\x99s torments till you speak the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not speak it, but I put my hand on his shoulder and kissed his\r\nforehead, and then burst into tears. He embraced me tenderly; and we\r\nhave been good friends ever since. He has been decently temperate at\r\ntable, and well-conducted towards Lady Lowborough. The first day he\r\nheld himself aloof from her, as far as he could without any flagrant\r\nbreach of hospitality: since that he has been friendly and civil, but\r\nnothing more\xe2\x80\x94in my presence, at least, nor, I think, at any other time;\r\nfor she seems haughty and displeased, and Lord Lowborough is manifestly\r\nmore cheerful, and more cordial towards his host than before. But I\r\nshall be glad when they are gone, for I have so little love for\r\nAnnabella that it is quite a task to be civil to her, and as she is the\r\nonly woman here besides myself, we are necessarily thrown so much\r\ntogether. Next time Mrs. Hargrave calls I shall hail her advent as\r\nquite a relief. I have a good mind to ask Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s leave to invite the\r\nold lady to stay with us till our guests depart. I think I will. She\r\nwill take it as a kind attention, and, though I have little relish for\r\nher society, she will be truly welcome as a third to stand between Lady\r\nLowborough and me.\r\n\r\nThe first time the latter and I were alone together, after that unhappy\r\nevening, was an hour or two after breakfast on the following day, when\r\nthe gentlemen were gone out, after the usual time spent in the writing\r\nof letters, the reading of newspapers, and desultory conversation. We\r\nsat silent for two or three minutes. She was busy with her work, and I\r\nwas running over the columns of a paper from which I had extracted all\r\nthe pith some twenty minutes before. It was a moment of painful\r\nembarrassment to me, and I thought it must be infinitely more so to\r\nher; but it seems I was mistaken. She was the first to speak; and,\r\nsmiling with the coolest assurance, she began,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband was merry last night, Helen: is he often so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy blood boiled in my face; but it was better she should seem to\r\nattribute his conduct to this than to anything else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cand never will be so again, I trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave him a curtain lecture, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! but I told him I disliked such conduct, and he promised me not to\r\nrepeat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _thought_ he looked rather subdued this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you, Helen? you\xe2\x80\x99ve been weeping, I see\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s our grand resource,\r\nyou know. But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it make your eyes smart? and do you always find\r\nit to answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never cry for effect; nor can I conceive how any one can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know: I never had occasion to try it; but I think if\r\nLowborough were to commit such improprieties, I\xe2\x80\x99d make _him_ cry. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at your being angry, for I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99d give my husband a\r\nlesson he would not soon forget for a lighter offence than that. But\r\nthen he never _will_ do anything of the kind; for I keep him in too\r\ngood order for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t arrogate too much of the credit to yourself.\r\nLord Lowborough was quite as remarkable for his abstemiousness for some\r\ntime before you married him, as he is now, I have heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, about the _wine_ you mean\xe2\x80\x94yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s safe enough for that. And as\r\nto looking askance to another woman, he\xe2\x80\x99s safe enough for that too,\r\nwhile I live, for he worships the very ground I tread on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! and are you sure you deserve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, as to that, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say: you know we\xe2\x80\x99re all fallible creatures,\r\nHelen; we none of us deserve to be worshipped. But are _you_ sure your\r\ndarling Huntingdon deserves all the love you give to _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew not what to answer to this. I was burning with anger; but I\r\nsuppressed all outward manifestations of it, and only bit my lip and\r\npretended to arrange my work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed she, pursuing her advantage, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can console\r\nyourself with the assurance that _you_ are worthy of all the love he\r\ngives to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou flatter me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, at least, I can try to be worthy of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d And then I turned the conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 25th.\xe2\x80\x94Last Christmas I was a bride, with a heart overflowing\r\nwith present bliss, and full of ardent hopes for the future, though not\r\nunmingled with foreboding fears. Now I am a wife: my bliss is sobered,\r\nbut not destroyed; my hopes diminished, but not departed; my fears\r\nincreased, but not yet thoroughly confirmed; and, thank heaven, I am a\r\nmother too. God has sent me a soul to educate for heaven, and give me a\r\nnew and calmer bliss, and stronger hopes to comfort me.\r\n\r\nDec. 25th, 1823.\xe2\x80\x94Another year is gone. My little Arthur lives and\r\nthrives. He is healthy, but not robust, full of gentle playfulness and\r\nvivacity, already affectionate, and susceptible of passions and\r\nemotions it will be long ere he can find words to express. He has won\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s heart at last; and now my constant terror is, lest he\r\nshould be ruined by that father\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtless indulgence. But I must\r\nbeware of my own weakness too, for I never knew till now how strong are\r\na parent\xe2\x80\x99s temptations to spoil an only child.\r\n\r\nI have need of consolation in my son, for (to this silent paper I may\r\nconfess it) I have but little in my husband. I love him still; and he\r\nloves me, in his own way\xe2\x80\x94but oh, how different from the love I could\r\nhave given, and once had hoped to receive! How little real sympathy\r\nthere exists between us; how many of my thoughts and feelings are\r\ngloomily cloistered within my own mind; how much of my higher and\r\nbetter self is indeed unmarried\xe2\x80\x94doomed either to harden and sour in the\r\nsunless shade of solitude, or to quite degenerate and fall away for\r\nlack of nutriment in this unwholesome soil! But, I repeat, I have no\r\nright to complain; only let me state the truth\xe2\x80\x94some of the truth, at\r\nleast,\xe2\x80\x94and see hereafter if any darker truths will blot these pages. We\r\nhave now been full two years united; the \xe2\x80\x9cromance\xe2\x80\x9d of our attachment\r\nmust be worn away. Surely I have now got down to the lowest gradation\r\nin Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s affection, and discovered all the evils of his nature: if\r\nthere be any further change, it must be for the better, as we become\r\nstill more accustomed to each other; surely we shall find no lower\r\ndepth than this. And, if so, I can bear it well\xe2\x80\x94as well, at least, as I\r\nhave borne it hitherto.\r\n\r\nArthur is not what is commonly called a _bad_ man: he has many good\r\nqualities; but he is a man without self-restraint or lofty aspirations,\r\na lover of pleasure, given up to animal enjoyments: he is not a bad\r\nhusband, but his notions of matrimonial duties and comforts are not my\r\nnotions. Judging from appearances, his idea of a wife is a thing to\r\nlove one devotedly, and to stay at home to wait upon her husband, and\r\namuse him and minister to his comfort in every possible way, while he\r\nchooses to stay with her; and, when he is absent, to attend to his\r\ninterests, domestic or otherwise, and patiently wait his return, no\r\nmatter how he may be occupied in the meantime.\r\n\r\nEarly in spring he announced his intention of going to London: his\r\naffairs there demanded his attendance, he said, and he could refuse it\r\nno longer. He expressed his regret at having to leave me, but hoped I\r\nwould amuse myself with the baby till he returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why leave me?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can go with you: I can be ready at any\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not take that child to town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thing was absurd: the air of the town would be certain to disagree\r\nwith him, and with me as a nurse; the late hours and London habits\r\nwould not suit me under such circumstances; and altogether he assured\r\nme that it would be excessively troublesome, injurious, and unsafe. I\r\nover-ruled his objections as well as I could, for I trembled at the\r\nthoughts of his going alone, and would sacrifice almost anything for\r\nmyself, much even for my child, to prevent it; but at length he told\r\nme, plainly, and somewhat testily, that he could not do with me: he was\r\nworn out with the baby\xe2\x80\x99s restless nights, and must have some repose. I\r\nproposed separate apartments; but it would not do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d I said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are weary of my company,\r\nand determined not to have me with you. You might as well have said so\r\nat once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe denied it; but I immediately left the room, and flew to the nursery,\r\nto hide my feelings, if I could not soothe them, there.\r\n\r\nI was too much hurt to express any further dissatisfaction with his\r\nplans, or at all to refer to the subject again, except for the\r\nnecessary arrangements concerning his departure and the conduct of\r\naffairs during his absence, till the day before he went, when I\r\nearnestly exhorted him to take care of himself and keep out of the way\r\nof temptation. He laughed at my anxiety, but assured me there was no\r\ncause for it, and promised to attend to my advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is no use asking you to fix a day for your return?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no; I hardly can, under the circumstances; but be assured, love,\r\nI shall not be long away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to keep you a prisoner at home,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI should not\r\ngrumble at your staying whole months away\xe2\x80\x94if you can be happy so long\r\nwithout me\xe2\x80\x94provided I knew you were safe; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of\r\nyour being there among your friends, as you call them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh, you silly girl! Do you think I can\xe2\x80\x99t take care of myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t last time. But THIS time, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, earnestly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshow me that you can, and teach me that I need not fear to trust you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe promised fair, but in such a manner as we seek to soothe a child.\r\nAnd did he keep his promise? No; and henceforth _I can never trust his\r\nword_. Bitter, bitter confession! Tears blind me while I write. It was\r\nearly in March that he went, and he did not return till July. This time\r\nhe did not trouble himself to make excuses as before, and his letters\r\nwere less frequent, and shorter and less affectionate, especially after\r\nthe first few weeks: they came slower and slower, and more terse and\r\ncareless every time. But still, when _I_ omitted writing, he complained\r\nof my neglect. When I wrote sternly and coldly, as I confess I\r\nfrequently did at the last, he blamed my harshness, and said it was\r\nenough to scare him from his home: when I tried mild persuasion, he was\r\na little more gentle in his replies, and promised to return; but I had\r\nlearnt, at last, to disregard his promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThose were four miserable months, alternating between intense anxiety,\r\ndespair, and indignation, pity for him and pity for myself. And yet,\r\nthrough all, I was not wholly comfortless: I had my darling, sinless,\r\ninoffensive little one to console me; but even this consolation was\r\nembittered by the constantly-recurring thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I teach him\r\nhereafter to respect his father, and yet to avoid his example?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I remembered that I had brought all these afflictions, in a manner\r\nwilfully, upon myself; and I determined to bear them without a murmur.\r\nAt the same time I resolved not to give myself up to misery for the\r\ntransgressions of another, and endeavoured to divert myself as much as\r\nI could; and besides the companionship of my child, and my dear,\r\nfaithful Rachel, who evidently guessed my sorrows and felt for them,\r\nthough she was too discreet to allude to them, I had my books and\r\npencil, my domestic affairs, and the welfare and comfort of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoor tenants and labourers to attend to: and I sometimes sought and\r\nobtained amusement in the company of my young friend Esther Hargrave:\r\noccasionally I rode over to see her, and once or twice I had her to\r\nspend the day with me at the Manor. Mrs. Hargrave did not visit London\r\nthat season: having no daughter to marry, she thought it as well to\r\nstay at home and economise; and, for a wonder, Walter came down to join\r\nher in the beginning of June, and stayed till near the close of August.\r\n\r\nThe first time I saw him was on a sweet, warm evening, when I was\r\nsauntering in the park with little Arthur and Rachel, who is head-nurse\r\nand lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid in one\xe2\x80\x94for, with my secluded life and tolerably active\r\nhabits, I require but little attendance, and as she had nursed me and\r\ncoveted to nurse my child, and was moreover so very trustworthy, I\r\npreferred committing the important charge to her, with a young\r\nnursery-maid under her directions, to engaging any one else: besides,\r\nit saves money; and since I have made acquaintance with Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs, I have learnt to regard that as no trifling recommendation;\r\nfor, by my own desire, nearly the whole of the income of my fortune is\r\ndevoted, for years to come, to the paying off of his debts, and the\r\nmoney he contrives to squander away in London is incomprehensible. But\r\nto return to Mr. Hargrave. I was standing with Rachel beside the water,\r\namusing the laughing baby in her arms with a twig of willow laden with\r\ngolden catkins, when, greatly to my surprise, he entered the park,\r\nmounted on his costly black hunter, and crossed over the grass to meet\r\nme. He saluted me with a very fine compliment, delicately worded, and\r\nmodestly delivered withal, which he had doubtless concocted as he rode\r\nalong. He told me he had brought a message from his mother, who, as he\r\nwas riding that way, had desired him to call at the Manor and beg the\r\npleasure of my company to a friendly family dinner to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one to meet but ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Esther is very\r\nanxious to see you; and my mother fears you will feel solitary in this\r\ngreat house so much alone, and wishes she could persuade you to give\r\nher the pleasure of your company more frequently, and make yourself at\r\nhome in our more humble dwelling, till Mr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s return shall\r\nrender this a little more conducive to your comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not alone, you see;\xe2\x80\x94and those\r\nwhose time is fully occupied seldom complain of solitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not come to-morrow, then? She will be sadly disappointed if\r\nyou refuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not relish being thus compassionated for my loneliness; but,\r\nhowever, I promised to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a sweet evening this is!\xe2\x80\x9d observed he, looking round upon the\r\nsunny park, with its imposing swell and slope, its placid water, and\r\nmajestic clumps of trees. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a paradise you live in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a lovely evening,\xe2\x80\x9d answered I; and I sighed to think how little\r\nI had felt its loveliness, and how little of a paradise sweet Grassdale\r\nwas to me\xe2\x80\x94how still less to the voluntary exile from its scenes.\r\nWhether Mr. Hargrave divined my thoughts, I cannot tell, but, with a\r\nhalf-hesitating, sympathising seriousness of tone and manner, he asked\r\nif I had lately heard from Mr. Huntingdon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot lately,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought not,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, as if to himself, looking thoughtfully on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not lately returned from London?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you see him there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I saw him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that is,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with increasing hesitation and an appearance of\r\nsuppressed indignation, \xe2\x80\x9che was as well as\xe2\x80\x94as he deserved to be, but\r\nunder circumstances I should have deemed incredible for a man so\r\nfavoured as he is.\xe2\x80\x9d He here looked up and pointed the sentence with a\r\nserious bow to me. I suppose my face was crimson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot suppress my\r\nindignation when I behold such infatuated blindness and perversion of\r\ntaste;\xe2\x80\x94but, perhaps, you are not aware\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am aware of nothing, sir\xe2\x80\x94except that he delays his coming longer\r\nthan I expected; and if, at present, he prefers the society of his\r\nfriends to that of his wife, and the dissipations of the town to the\r\nquiet of country life, I suppose I have those friends to thank for it.\r\n_Their_ tastes and occupations are similar to his, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why\r\nhis conduct should awaken either their indignation or surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wrong me cruelly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered he. \xe2\x80\x9cI have shared but little of Mr.\r\nHuntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s society for the last few weeks; and as for his tastes and\r\noccupations, they are quite beyond me\xe2\x80\x94lonely wanderer as I am. Where I\r\nhave but sipped and tasted, he drains the cup to the dregs; and if ever\r\nfor a moment I have sought to drown the voice of reflection in madness\r\nand folly, or if I have wasted too much of my time and talents among\r\nreckless and dissipated companions, God knows I would gladly renounce\r\nthem entirely and for ever, if I had but _half_ the blessings that man\r\nso thanklessly casts behind his back\xe2\x80\x94but _half_ the inducements to\r\nvirtue and domestic, orderly habits that he despises\xe2\x80\x94but _such_ a home,\r\nand _such_ a partner to share it! It is infamous!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, between\r\nhis teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t think, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d he added aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\ncould be guilty of inciting him to persevere in his present pursuits:\r\non the contrary, I have remonstrated with him again and again; I have\r\nfrequently expressed my surprise at his conduct, and reminded him of\r\nhis duties and his privileges\xe2\x80\x94but to no purpose; he only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, Mr. Hargrave; you ought to be aware that whatever my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaults may be, it can only aggravate the evil for me to hear them from\r\na stranger\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Am_ I then a stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a sorrowful tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI am your\r\nnearest neighbour, your son\xe2\x80\x99s godfather, and your husband\xe2\x80\x99s friend; may\r\nI not be yours also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntimate acquaintance must precede real friendship; I know but little\r\nof you, Mr. Hargrave, except from report.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you then forgotten the six or seven weeks I spent under your roof\r\nlast autumn? _I_ have not forgotten them. And I know enough of _you_,\r\nMrs. Huntingdon, to think that your husband is the most enviable man in\r\nthe world, and I should be the next if you would deem me worthy of your\r\nfriendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew more of me, you would not think it, or if you did you\r\nwould not say it, and expect me to be flattered by the compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stepped backward as I spoke. He saw that I wished the conversation to\r\nend; and immediately taking the hint, he gravely bowed, wished me\r\ngood-evening, and turned his horse towards the road. He appeared\r\ngrieved and hurt at my unkind reception of his sympathising overtures.\r\nI was not sure that I had done right in speaking so harshly to him;\r\nbut, at the time, I had felt irritated\xe2\x80\x94almost insulted by his conduct;\r\nit seemed as if he was presuming upon the absence and neglect of my\r\nhusband, and insinuating even more than the truth against him.\r\n\r\nRachel had moved on, during our conversation, to some yards\xe2\x80\x99 distance.\r\nHe rode up to her, and asked to see the child. He took it carefully\r\ninto his arms, looked upon it with an almost paternal smile, and I\r\nheard him say, as I approached,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this, too, he has forsaken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then tenderly kissed it, and restored it to the gratified nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you fond of children, Mr. Hargrave?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, a little softened\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in general,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is such a _sweet_ child, and so\r\nlike its mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a lower tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken there; it is its father it resembles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I not right, nurse?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, appealing to Rachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, sir, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of both,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nHe departed; and Rachel pronounced him a very nice gentleman. I had\r\nstill my doubts on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following six weeks I met him several times, but\r\nalways, save once, in company with his mother, or his sister, or both.\r\nWhen I called on them, he always happened to be at home, and, when they\r\ncalled on me, it was always he that drove them over in the phaeton. His\r\nmother, evidently, was quite delighted with his dutiful attentions and\r\nnewly-acquired domestic habits.\r\n\r\nThe time that I met him alone was on a bright, but not oppressively hot\r\nday, in the beginning of July: I had taken little Arthur into the wood\r\nthat skirts the park, and there seated him on the moss-cushioned roots\r\nof an old oak; and, having gathered a handful of bluebells and\r\nwild-roses, I was kneeling before him, and presenting them, one by one,\r\nto the grasp of his tiny fingers; enjoying the heavenly beauty of the\r\nflowers, through the medium of his smiling eyes: forgetting, for the\r\nmoment, all my cares, laughing at his gleeful laughter, and delighting\r\nmyself with his delight,\xe2\x80\x94when a shadow suddenly eclipsed the little\r\nspace of sunshine on the grass before us; and looking up, I beheld\r\nWalter Hargrave standing and gazing upon us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was spell-bound; I had\r\nneither the power to come forward and interrupt you, nor to withdraw\r\nfrom the contemplation of such a scene. How vigorous my little godson\r\ngrows! and how merry he is this morning!\xe2\x80\x9d He approached the child, and\r\nstooped to take his hand; but, on seeing that his caresses were likely\r\nto produce tears and lamentations, instead of a reciprocation of\r\nfriendly demonstrations, he prudently drew back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pleasure and comfort that little creature must be to you, Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon!\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, with a touch of sadness in his intonation, as\r\nhe admiringly contemplated the infant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I; and then I asked after his mother and sister.\r\n\r\nHe politely answered my inquiries, and then returned again to the\r\nsubject I wished to avoid; though with a degree of timidity that\r\nwitnessed his fear to offend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not heard from Huntingdon lately?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot this week,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. Not these three weeks, I might have said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a letter from him this morning. I wish it were such a one as I\r\ncould show to his lady.\xe2\x80\x9d He half drew from his waistcoat-pocket a\r\nletter with Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s still beloved hand on the address, scowled at it,\r\nand put it back again, adding\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut he tells me he is about to return\r\nnext week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe tells _me_ so every time he writes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! well, it is like him. But to me he always avowed it his\r\nintention to stay till the present month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck me like a blow, this proof of premeditated transgression and\r\nsystematic disregard of truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only of a piece with the rest of his conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr.\r\nHargrave, thoughtfully regarding me, and reading, I suppose, my\r\nfeelings in my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is really coming next week?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may rely upon it, if the assurance can give you any pleasure. And\r\nis it _possible_, Mrs. Huntingdon, that you can rejoice at his return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe exclaimed, attentively perusing my features again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, Mr. Hargrave; is he not my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Huntingdon; you know not _what_ you slight!\xe2\x80\x9d he passionately\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\nI took up my baby, and, wishing him good-morning, departed, to indulge\r\nmy thoughts unscrutinized, within the sanctum of my home.\r\n\r\nAnd _was_ I glad? Yes, delighted; though I was angered by Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct, and though I felt that he had wronged me, and was determined\r\nhe should feel it too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I received a few lines from him myself,\r\nconfirming Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s intimations respecting his approaching return.\r\nAnd he did come next week, but in a condition of body and mind even\r\nworse than before. I did not, however, intend to pass over his\r\nderelictions this time without a remark; I found it would not do. But\r\nthe first day he was weary with his journey, and I was glad to get him\r\nback: I would not upbraid him then; I would wait till to-morrow. Next\r\nmorning he was weary still: I would wait a little longer. But at\r\ndinner, when, after breakfasting at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock on a bottle of\r\nsoda-water and a cup of strong coffee, and lunching at two on another\r\nbottle of soda-water mingled with brandy, he was finding fault with\r\neverything on the table, and declaring we must change our cook, I\r\nthought the time was come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the same cook as we had before you went, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwere generally pretty well satisfied with her then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have been letting her get into slovenly habits, then, while I\r\nwas away. It is enough to poison one, eating such a disgusting mess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he pettishly pushed away his plate, and leant back despairingly in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is you that are changed, not she,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, but with the\r\nutmost gentleness, for I did not wish to irritate him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied carelessly, as he seized a tumbler of wine\r\nand water, adding, when he had tossed it off, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have an infernal\r\nfire in my veins, that all the waters of the ocean cannot quench!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kindled it?\xe2\x80\x9d I was about to ask, but at that moment the butler\r\nentered and began to take away the things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quick, Benson; do have done with that infernal clatter!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his\r\nmaster. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ bring the cheese, unless you want to make me sick\r\noutright!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenson, in some surprise, removed the cheese, and did his best to\r\neffect a quiet and speedy clearance of the rest; but, unfortunately,\r\nthere was a rumple in the carpet, caused by the hasty pushing back of\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s chair, at which he tripped and stumbled, causing a rather\r\nalarming concussion with the trayful of crockery in his hands, but no\r\npositive damage, save the fall and breaking of a sauce tureen; but, to\r\nmy unspeakable shame and dismay, Arthur turned furiously around upon\r\nhim, and swore at him with savage coarseness. The poor man turned pale,\r\nand visibly trembled as he stooped to pick up the fragments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cthe carpet caught his foot, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no great harm done. Never mind the pieces now, Benson; you can\r\nclear them away afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGlad to be released, Benson expeditiously set out the dessert and\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _could_ you mean, Helen, by taking the servant\xe2\x80\x99s part against\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, as soon as the door was closed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you knew I was\r\ndistracted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know you were distracted, Arthur: and the poor man was quite\r\nfrightened and hurt at your sudden explosion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor man, indeed! and do you think I could stop to consider the\r\nfeelings of an insensate brute like that, when my own nerves were\r\nracked and torn to pieces by his confounded blunders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard you complain of your nerves before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I have nerves as well as you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute your claim to their possession, but _I_ never\r\ncomplain of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, how should you, when you never do anything to try them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you try yours, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I have nothing to do but to stay at home and take care of\r\nmyself like a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it impossible, then, to take care of yourself like a man when you\r\ngo abroad? You told me that you could, and would too; and you\r\npromised\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Helen, don\xe2\x80\x99t begin with that nonsense now; I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t bear what?\xe2\x80\x94to be reminded of the promises you have broken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, you are cruel. If you knew how my heart throbbed, and how every\r\nnerve thrilled through me while you spoke, you would spare me. You can\r\npity a dolt of a servant for breaking a dish; but you have no\r\ncompassion for _me_ when my head is split in two and all on fire with\r\nthis consuming fever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leant his head on his hand, and sighed. I went to him and put my\r\nhand on his forehead. It was burning indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen come with me into the drawing-room, Arthur; and don\xe2\x80\x99t take any\r\nmore wine: you have taken several glasses since dinner, and eaten next\r\nto nothing all the day. How can _that_ make you better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith some coaxing and persuasion, I got him to leave the table. When\r\nthe baby was brought I tried to amuse him with that; but poor little\r\nArthur was cutting his teeth, and his father could not bear his\r\ncomplaints: sentence of immediate banishment was passed upon him on the\r\nfirst indication of fretfulness; and because, in the course of the\r\nevening, I went to share his exile for a little while, I was\r\nreproached, on my return, for preferring my child to my husband. I\r\nfound the latter reclining on the sofa just as I had left him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the injured man, in a tone of pseudo-resignation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t send for you; I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just see how long it\r\nwould please you to leave me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not been very long, have I, Arthur? I have not been an hour,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course, an hour is nothing to you, so pleasantly employed; but\r\nto _me_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has not been pleasantly employed,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted I. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nnursing our poor little baby, who is very far from well, and I could\r\nnot leave him till I got him to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, to be sure, you\xe2\x80\x99re overflowing with kindness and pity for\r\neverything but me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why should I pity _you?_ What is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! that passes everything! After all the wear and tear that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad, when I come home sick and weary, longing for comfort, and\r\nexpecting to find attention and kindness, at least from my wife, she\r\ncalmly asks what is the matter with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is _nothing_ the matter with you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept what you\r\nhave wilfully brought upon yourself, against my earnest exhortation and\r\nentreaty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he emphatically, half rising from his recumbent\r\nposture, \xe2\x80\x9cif you bother me with another word, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring the bell and\r\norder six bottles of wine, and, by heaven, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drink them dry before I\r\nstir from this place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said no more, but sat down before the table and drew a book towards\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo let me have quietness at least!\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you deny me\r\nevery other comfort;\xe2\x80\x9d and sinking back into his former position, with\r\nan impatient expiration between a sigh and a groan, he languidly closed\r\nhis eyes, as if to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhat the book was that lay open on the table before me, I cannot tell,\r\nfor I never looked at it. With an elbow on each side of it, and my\r\nhands clasped before my eyes, I delivered myself up to silent weeping.\r\nBut Arthur was not asleep: at the first slight sob, he raised his head\r\nand looked round, impatiently exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you crying for,\r\nHelen? What the deuce is the matter _now?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m crying for you, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, speedily drying my tears; and\r\nstarting up, I threw myself on my knees before him, and clasping his\r\nnerveless hand between my own, continued: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that you are\r\na part of myself? And do you think you can injure and degrade yourself,\r\nand I not feel it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Degrade_ myself, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, degrade! What have you been doing all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better not ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you had better not tell; but you cannot deny that you _have_\r\ndegraded yourself miserably. You have shamefully wronged yourself, body\r\nand soul, and me too; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t endure it quietly, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t squeeze my hand so frantically, and don\xe2\x80\x99t agitate me so,\r\nfor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Oh, Hattersley! you were right: this woman will be\r\nthe death of me, with her keen feelings and her interesting force of\r\ncharacter. There, there, do spare me a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArthur, you _must_ repent!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, in a frenzy of desperation,\r\nthrowing my arms around him and burying my face in his bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\n_shall_ say you are sorry for what you have done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not! you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never live to do it again if you treat me so savagely,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied he, pushing me from him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve nearly squeezed the breath out\r\nof my body.\xe2\x80\x9d He pressed his hand to his heart, and looked really\r\nagitated and ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow get me a glass of wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto remedy what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, you\r\nshe tiger! I\xe2\x80\x99m almost ready to faint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI flew to get the required remedy. It seemed to revive him\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as I took the empty glass from his hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor a strong young man like you to reduce yourself to such a state!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew all, my girl, you\xe2\x80\x99d say rather, \xe2\x80\x98What a wonder it is you\r\ncan bear it so well as you do!\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived more in these four months,\r\nHelen, than you have in the whole course of your existence, or will to\r\nthe end of your days, if they numbered a hundred years; so I must\r\nexpect to pay for it in some shape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to pay a higher price than you anticipate, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake care: there will be the total loss of your own health, and of my\r\naffection too, if _that_ is of any value to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you\xe2\x80\x99re at that game of threatening me with the loss of your\r\naffection again, are you? I think it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been very genuine\r\nstuff to begin with, if it\xe2\x80\x99s so easily demolished. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\r\nmy pretty tyrant, you\xe2\x80\x99ll make me regret my choice in good earnest, and\r\nenvy my friend Hattersley his meek little wife: she\xe2\x80\x99s quite a pattern\r\nto her sex, Helen. He had her with him in London all the season, and\r\nshe was no trouble at all. He might amuse himself just as he pleased,\r\nin regular bachelor style, and she never complained of neglect; he\r\nmight come home at any hour of the night or morning, or not come home\r\nat all; be sullen, sober, or glorious drunk; and play the fool or the\r\nmadman to his own heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire, without any fear or botheration. She\r\nnever gives him a word of reproach or complaint, do what he will. He\r\nsays there\xe2\x80\x99s not such a jewel in all England, and swears he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake a kingdom for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he makes her life a curse to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he! She has no will but his, and is always contented and happy as\r\nlong as he is enjoying himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case she is as great a fool as he is; but it is not so. I have\r\nseveral letters from her, expressing the greatest anxiety about his\r\nproceedings, and complaining that you incite him to commit those\r\nextravagances\xe2\x80\x94one especially, in which she implores me to use my\r\ninfluence with you to get you away from London, and affirms that her\r\nhusband never did such things before you came, and would certainly\r\ndiscontinue them as soon as you departed and left him to the guidance\r\nof his own good sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe detestable little traitor! Give me the letter, and he shall see it\r\nas sure as I\xe2\x80\x99m a living man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he shall not see it without her consent; but if he did, there is\r\nnothing there to anger him, nor in any of the others. She never speaks\r\na word against him: it is only anxiety _for_ him that she expresses.\r\nShe only alludes to his conduct in the most delicate terms, and makes\r\nevery excuse for him that she can possibly think of; and as for her own\r\nmisery, I rather _feel_ it than _see_ it expressed in her letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she abuses _me;_ and no doubt you helped her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I told her she over-rated my influence with you, that I would\r\ngladly draw you away from the temptations of the town if I could, but\r\nhad little hope of success, and that I thought she was wrong in\r\nsupposing that you enticed Mr. Hattersley or any one else into error. I\r\nhad myself held the _contrary_ opinion at one time, but I now believed\r\nthat you mutually corrupted each other; and, perhaps, if she used a\r\nlittle gentle but serious remonstrance with her husband, it might be of\r\nsome service; as, though he was more rough-hewn than mine, I believed\r\nhe was of a less impenetrable material.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so _that_ is the way you go on\xe2\x80\x94heartening each other up to mutiny,\r\nand abusing each other\xe2\x80\x99s partners, and throwing out implications\r\nagainst your own, to the mutual gratification of both!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to your own account,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cmy evil counsel has had but\r\nlittle effect upon _her_. And as to abuse and aspersions, we are both\r\nof us far too deeply ashamed of the errors and vices of our other\r\nhalves, to make them the common subject of our correspondence. Friends\r\nas we are, we would willingly keep your failings to ourselves\xe2\x80\x94even\r\n_from_ ourselves if we could, unless by knowing them we could deliver\r\nyou from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well! don\xe2\x80\x99t worry me about them: you\xe2\x80\x99ll never effect any good by\r\nthat. Have patience with me, and bear with my languor and crossness a\r\nlittle while, till I get this cursed low fever out of my veins, and\r\nthen you\xe2\x80\x99ll find me cheerful and kind as ever. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you be gentle\r\nand good, as you were last time?\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I was very grateful for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what good did your gratitude do? I deluded myself with the idea\r\nthat you were ashamed of your transgressions, and hoped you would never\r\nrepeat them again; but now you have left me nothing to hope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy case is quite desperate, is it? A very blessed consideration, if it\r\nwill only secure me from the pain and worry of my dear anxious wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nefforts to convert me, and her from the toil and trouble of such\r\nexertions, and her sweet face and silver accents from the ruinous\r\neffects of the same. A burst of passion is a fine rousing thing upon\r\noccasion, Helen, and a flood of tears is marvellously affecting, but,\r\nwhen indulged too often, they are both deuced plaguy things for\r\nspoiling one\xe2\x80\x99s beauty and tiring out one\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThenceforth I restrained my tears and passions as much as I could. I\r\nspared him my exhortations and fruitless efforts at conversion too, for\r\nI saw it was all in vain: God might awaken that heart, supine and\r\nstupefied with self-indulgence, and remove the film of sensual darkness\r\nfrom his eyes, but I could not. His injustice and ill-humour towards\r\nhis inferiors, who could not defend themselves, I still resented and\r\nwithstood; but when I alone was their object, as was frequently the\r\ncase, I endured it with calm forbearance, except at times, when my\r\ntemper, worn out by repeated annoyances, or stung to distraction by\r\nsome new instance of irrationality, gave way in spite of myself, and\r\nexposed me to the imputations of fierceness, cruelty, and impatience. I\r\nattended carefully to his wants and amusements, but not, I own, with\r\nthe same devoted fondness as before, because I could not feel it;\r\nbesides, I had now another claimant on my time and care\xe2\x80\x94my ailing\r\ninfant, for whose sake I frequently braved and suffered the reproaches\r\nand complaints of his unreasonably exacting father.\r\n\r\nBut Arthur is not naturally a peevish or irritable man; so far from it,\r\nthat there was something almost ludicrous in the incongruity of this\r\nadventitious fretfulness and nervous irritability, rather calculated to\r\nexcite laughter than anger, if it were not for the intensely painful\r\nconsiderations attendant upon those symptoms of a disordered frame, and\r\nhis temper gradually improved as his bodily health was restored, which\r\nwas much sooner than would have been the case but for my strenuous\r\nexertions; for there was still one thing about him that I did not give\r\nup in despair, and one effort for his preservation that I would not\r\nremit. His appetite for the stimulus of wine had increased upon him, as\r\nI had too well foreseen. It was now something more to him than an\r\naccessory to social enjoyment: it was an important source of enjoyment\r\nin itself. In this time of weakness and depression he would have made\r\nit his medicine and support, his comforter, his recreation, and his\r\nfriend, and thereby sunk deeper and deeper, and bound himself down for\r\never in the bathos whereinto he had fallen. But I determined this\r\nshould never be, as long as I had any influence left; and though I\r\ncould not prevent him from taking more than was good for him, still, by\r\nincessant perseverance, by kindness, and firmness, and vigilance, by\r\ncoaxing, and daring, and determination, I succeeded in preserving him\r\nfrom absolute bondage to that detestable propensity, so insidious in\r\nits advances, so inexorable in its tyranny, so disastrous in its\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must not forget that I am not a little indebted to his\r\nfriend Mr. Hargrave. About that time he frequently called at Grassdale,\r\nand often dined with us, on which occasions I fear Arthur would\r\nwillingly have cast prudence and decorum to the winds, and made \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nnight of it,\xe2\x80\x9d as often as his friend would have consented to join him\r\nin that exalted pastime; and if the latter had chosen to comply, he\r\nmight, in a night or two, have ruined the labour of weeks, and\r\noverthrown with a touch the frail bulwark it had cost me such trouble\r\nand toil to construct. I was so fearful of this at first, that I\r\nhumbled myself to intimate to him, in private, my apprehensions of\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s proneness to these excesses, and to express a hope that he\r\nwould not encourage it. He was pleased with this mark of confidence,\r\nand certainly did not betray it. On that and every subsequent occasion\r\nhis presence served rather as a check upon his host, than an incitement\r\nto further acts of intemperance; and he always succeeded in bringing\r\nhim from the dining-room in good time, and in tolerably good condition;\r\nfor if Arthur disregarded such intimations as \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must not detain\r\nyou from your lady,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWe must not forget that Mrs. Huntingdon is\r\nalone,\xe2\x80\x9d he would insist upon leaving the table himself, to join me, and\r\nhis host, however unwillingly, was obliged to follow.\r\n\r\nHence I learned to welcome Mr. Hargrave as a real friend to the family,\r\na harmless companion for Arthur, to cheer his spirits and preserve him\r\nfrom the tedium of absolute idleness and a total isolation from all\r\nsociety but mine, and a useful ally to me. I could not but feel\r\ngrateful to him under such circumstances; and I did not scruple to\r\nacknowledge my obligation on the first convenient opportunity; yet, as\r\nI did so, my heart whispered all was not right, and brought a glow to\r\nmy face, which he heightened by his steady, serious gaze, while, by his\r\nmanner of receiving those acknowledgments, he more than doubled my\r\nmisgivings. His high delight at being able to serve me was chastened by\r\nsympathy for me and commiseration for himself\xe2\x80\x94about, I know not what,\r\nfor I would not stay to inquire, or suffer him to unburden his sorrows\r\nto me. His sighs and intimations of suppressed affliction seemed to\r\ncome from a full heart; but either he must contrive to retain them\r\nwithin it, or breathe them forth in other ears than mine: there was\r\nenough of confidence between us already. It seemed wrong that there\r\nshould exist a secret understanding between my husband\xe2\x80\x99s friend and me,\r\nunknown to him, of which he was the object. But my after-thought was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is wrong, surely Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s is the fault, not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd indeed I know not whether, at the time, it was not for _him_ rather\r\nthan myself that I blushed; for, since he and I are one, I so identify\r\nmyself with him, that I feel his degradation, his failings, and\r\ntransgressions as my own: I blush for him, I fear for him; I repent for\r\nhim, weep, pray, and feel for him as for myself; but I cannot act for\r\nhim; and hence I must be, and I am, debased, contaminated by the union,\r\nboth in my own eyes and in the actual truth. I am so determined to love\r\nhim, so intensely anxious to excuse his errors, that I am continually\r\ndwelling upon them, and labouring to extenuate the loosest of his\r\nprinciples and the worst of his practices, till I am familiarised with\r\nvice, and almost a partaker in his sins. Things that formerly shocked\r\nand disgusted me, now seem only natural. I know them to be wrong,\r\nbecause reason and God\xe2\x80\x99s word declare them to be so; but I am gradually\r\nlosing that instinctive horror and repulsion which were given me by\r\nnature, or instilled into me by the precepts and example of my aunt.\r\nPerhaps then I was too severe in my judgments, for I abhorred the\r\nsinner as well as the sin; now I flatter myself I am more charitable\r\nand considerate; but am I not becoming more indifferent and insensate\r\ntoo? Fool that I was, to dream that I had strength and purity enough to\r\nsave myself and him! Such vain presumption would be rightly served, if\r\nI should perish with him in the gulf from which I sought to save him!\r\nYet, God preserve me from it, and him too! Yes, poor Arthur, I will\r\nstill hope and pray for you; and though I write as if you were some\r\nabandoned wretch, past hope and past reprieve, it is only my anxious\r\nfears, my strong desires that make me do so; one who loved you less\r\nwould be less bitter, less dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nHis conduct has, of late, been what the world calls irreproachable; but\r\nthen I know his heart is still unchanged; and I know that spring is\r\napproaching, and deeply dread the consequences.\r\n\r\nAs he began to recover the tone and vigour of his exhausted frame, and\r\nwith it something of his former impatience of retirement and repose, I\r\nsuggested a short residence by the sea-side, for his recreation and\r\nfurther restoration, and for the benefit of our little one as well. But\r\nno: watering-places were so intolerably dull; besides, he had been\r\ninvited by one of his friends to spend a month or two in Scotland for\r\nthe better recreation of grouse-shooting and deer-stalking, and had\r\npromised to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will leave me again, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dearest, but only to love you the better when I come back, and\r\nmake up for all past offences and short-comings; and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t fear\r\nme this time: there are no temptations on the mountains. And during my\r\nabsence you may pay a visit to Staningley, if you like: your uncle and\r\naunt have long been wanting us to go there, you know; but somehow\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s such a repulsion between the good lady and me, that I never\r\ncould bring myself up to the scratch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout the third week in August, Arthur set out for Scotland, and Mr.\r\nHargrave accompanied him thither, to my private satisfaction. Shortly\r\nafter, I, with little Arthur and Rachel, went to Staningley, my dear\r\nold home, which, as well as my dear old friends its inhabitants, I saw\r\nagain with mingled feelings of pleasure and pain so intimately blended\r\nthat I could scarcely distinguish the one from the other, or tell to\r\nwhich to attribute the various tears, and smiles, and sighs awakened by\r\nthose old familiar scenes, and tones, and faces.\r\n\r\nArthur did not come home till several weeks after my return to\r\nGrassdale; but I did not feel so anxious about him now; to think of him\r\nengaged in active sports among the wild hills of Scotland, was very\r\ndifferent from knowing him to be immersed amid the corruptions and\r\ntemptations of London. His letters now; though neither long nor\r\nloverlike, were more regular than ever they had been before; and when\r\nhe did return, to my great joy, instead of being worse than when he\r\nwent, he was more cheerful and vigorous, and better in every respect.\r\nSince that time I have had little cause to complain. He still has an\r\nunfortunate predilection for the pleasures of the table, against which\r\nI have to struggle and watch; but he has begun to notice his boy, and\r\nthat is an increasing source of amusement to him within-doors, while\r\nhis fox-hunting and coursing are a sufficient occupation for him\r\nwithout, when the ground is not hardened by frost; so that he is not\r\nwholly dependent on me for entertainment. But it is now January; spring\r\nis approaching; and, I repeat, I dread the consequences of its arrival.\r\nThat sweet season, I once so joyously welcomed as the time of hope and\r\ngladness, awakens now far other anticipations by its return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 20th, 1824. The dreaded time is come, and Arthur is gone, as I\r\nexpected. This time he announced it his intention to make but a short\r\nstay in London, and pass over to the Continent, where he should\r\nprobably stay a few weeks; but I shall not expect him till after the\r\nlapse of many weeks: I now know that, with him, days signify weeks, and\r\nweeks months.\r\n\r\nJuly 30th.\xe2\x80\x94He returned about three weeks ago, rather better in health,\r\ncertainly, than before, but still worse in temper. And yet, perhaps, I\r\nam wrong: it is _I_ that am less patient and forbearing. I am tired out\r\nwith his injustice, his selfishness and hopeless _depravity_. I wish a\r\nmilder word would do; I am no angel, and my corruption rises against\r\nit. My poor father died last week: Arthur was vexed to hear of it,\r\nbecause he saw that I was shocked and grieved, and he feared the\r\ncircumstance would mar his comfort. When I spoke of ordering my\r\nmourning, he exclaimed,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hate black! But, however, I suppose you must wear it awhile, for\r\nform\xe2\x80\x99s sake; but I hope, Helen, you won\xe2\x80\x99t think it your bounden duty to\r\ncompose your face and manners into conformity with your funereal garb.\r\nWhy should you sigh and groan, and I be made uncomfortable, because an\r\nold gentleman in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94shire, a perfect stranger to us both, has thought\r\nproper to drink himself to death? There, now, I declare you\xe2\x80\x99re crying!\r\nWell, it must be affectation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would not hear of my attending the funeral, or going for a day or\r\ntwo, to cheer poor Frederick\xe2\x80\x99s solitude. It was quite unnecessary, he\r\nsaid, and I was unreasonable to wish it. What was my father to me? I\r\nhad never seen him but once since I was a baby, and I well knew he had\r\nnever cared a stiver about me; and my brother, too, was little better\r\nthan a stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, dear Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, embracing me with\r\nflattering fondness, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot spare you for a single day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how have you managed without me these _many_ days?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! then I was knocking about the world, now I am at home, and home\r\nwithout you, my household deity, would be intolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as long as I am necessary to your comfort; but you did not say so\r\nbefore, when you urged me to leave you, in order that you might get\r\naway from your home without me,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted I; but before the words were\r\nwell out of my mouth, I regretted having uttered them. It seemed so\r\nheavy a charge: if false, too gross an insult; if true, too humiliating\r\na fact to be thus openly cast in his teeth. But I might have spared\r\nmyself that momentary pang of self-reproach. The accusation awoke\r\nneither shame nor indignation in him: he attempted neither denial nor\r\nexcuse, but only answered with a long, low, chuckling laugh, as if he\r\nviewed the whole transaction as a clever, merry jest from beginning to\r\nend. Surely that man will make me dislike him at last!\r\n\r\nSine as ye brew, my maiden fair,\r\nKeep mind that ye maun drink the yill.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes; and I _will_ drink it to the very dregs: and none but myself shall\r\nknow how bitter I find it!\r\n\r\nAugust 20th.\xe2\x80\x94We are shaken down again to about our usual position.\r\nArthur has returned to nearly his former condition and habits; and I\r\nhave found it my wisest plan to shut my eyes against the past and\r\nfuture, as far as _he_ at least is concerned, and live only for the\r\npresent: to love him when I can; to smile (if possible) when he smiles,\r\nbe cheerful when he is cheerful, and pleased when he is agreeable; and\r\nwhen he is not, to try to make him so; and if that won\xe2\x80\x99t answer, to\r\nbear with him, to excuse him, and forgive him as well as I can, and\r\nrestrain my own evil passions from aggravating his; and yet, while I\r\nthus yield and minister to his more harmless propensities to\r\nself-indulgence, to do all in my power to save him from the worse.\r\n\r\nBut we shall not be long alone together. I shall shortly be called upon\r\nto entertain the same select body of friends as we had the autumn\r\nbefore last, with the addition of Mr. Hattersley and, at my special\r\nrequest, his wife and child. I long to see Milicent, and her little\r\ngirl too. The latter is now above a year old; she will be a charming\r\nplaymate for my little Arthur.\r\n\r\nSeptember 30th.\xe2\x80\x94Our guests have been here a week or two; but I have had\r\nno leisure to pass any comments upon them till now. I cannot get over\r\nmy dislike to Lady Lowborough. It is not founded on mere personal\r\npique; it is the woman herself that I dislike, because I so thoroughly\r\ndisapprove of her. I always avoid her company as much as I can without\r\nviolating the laws of hospitality; but when we do speak or converse\r\ntogether, it is with the utmost civility, even apparent cordiality on\r\nher part; but preserve me from such cordiality! It is like handling\r\nbrier-roses and may-blossoms, bright enough to the eye, and outwardly\r\nsoft to the touch, but you know there are thorns beneath, and every now\r\nand then you feel them too; and perhaps resent the injury by crushing\r\nthem in till you have destroyed their power, though somewhat to the\r\ndetriment of your own fingers.\r\n\r\nOf late, however, I have seen nothing in her conduct towards Arthur to\r\nanger or alarm me. During the first few days I thought she seemed very\r\nsolicitous to win his admiration. Her efforts were not unnoticed by\r\nhim: I frequently saw him smiling to himself at her artful man\xc5\x93uvres:\r\nbut, to his praise be it spoken, her shafts fell powerless by his side.\r\nHer most bewitching smiles, her haughtiest frowns were ever received\r\nwith the same immutable, careless good-humour; till, finding he was\r\nindeed impenetrable, she suddenly remitted her efforts, and became, to\r\nall appearance, as perfectly indifferent as himself. Nor have I since\r\nwitnessed any symptom of pique on his part, or renewed attempts at\r\nconquest upon hers.\r\n\r\nThis is as it should be; but Arthur never will let me be satisfied with\r\nhim. I have never, for a single hour since I married him, known what it\r\nis to realise that sweet idea, \xe2\x80\x9cIn quietness and confidence shall be\r\nyour rest.\xe2\x80\x9d Those two detestable men, Grimsby and Hattersley, have\r\ndestroyed all my labour against his love of wine. They encourage him\r\ndaily to overstep the bounds of moderation, and not unfrequently to\r\ndisgrace himself by positive excess. I shall not soon forget the second\r\nnight after their arrival. Just as I had retired from the dining-room\r\nwith the ladies, before the door was closed upon us, Arthur\r\nexclaimed,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, my lads, what say you to a regular\r\njollification?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilicent glanced at me with a half-reproachful look, as if _I_ could\r\nhinder it; but her countenance changed when she heard Hattersley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, shouting through door and wall,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ your man! Send for more wine: here isn\xe2\x80\x99t _half_ enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely entered the drawing-room before we were joined by Lord\r\nLowborough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _can_ induce you to come so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his lady, with a\r\nmost ungracious air of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I never drink, Annabella,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he seriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you might stay with them a little: it looks so silly to be\r\nalways dangling after the women; I wonder you can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reproached her with a look of mingled bitterness and surprise, and,\r\nsinking into a chair, suppressed a heavy sigh, bit his pale lips, and\r\nfixed his eyes upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did right to leave them, Lord Lowborough,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust you\r\nwill always continue to honour us so early with your company. And if\r\nAnnabella knew the value of true wisdom, and the misery of folly\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and intemperance, she would not talk such nonsense\xe2\x80\x94even in jest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes while I spoke, and gravely turned them upon me, with\r\na half-surprised, half-abstracted look, and then bent them on his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI know the value of a warm heart and a bold,\r\nmanly spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Annabella,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a deep and hollow tone, \xe2\x80\x9csince my\r\npresence is disagreeable to you, I will relieve you of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going back to them, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he, with harsh and startling emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not go\r\nback to them! And I will never stay with them one moment longer than I\r\nthink right, for you or any other tempter! But you needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that; I\r\nshall never trouble you again by intruding my company upon you so\r\nunseasonably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the room: I heard the hall-door open and shut, and immediately\r\nafter, on putting aside the curtain, I saw him pacing down the park, in\r\nthe comfortless gloom of the damp, cloudy twilight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would serve you right, Annabella,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, at length, \xe2\x80\x9cif Lord\r\nLowborough were to return to his old habits, which had so nearly\r\neffected his ruin, and which it cost him such an effort to break: you\r\nwould then see cause to repent such conduct as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my dear! I should not mind if his lordship were to see fit\r\nto intoxicate himself every day: I should only the sooner be rid of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Annabella!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milicent. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you say such wicked things!\r\nIt would, indeed, be a just punishment, as far as you are concerned, if\r\nProvidence should take you at your word, and make you feel what others\r\nfeel, that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She paused as a sudden burst of loud talking and laughter\r\nreached us from the dining-room, in which the voice of Hattersley was\r\npre-eminently conspicuous, even to my unpractised ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _you_ feel at this moment, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lowborough, with\r\na malicious smile, fixing her eyes upon her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s distressed\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nThe latter offered no reply, but averted her face and brushed away a\r\ntear. At that moment the door opened and admitted Mr. Hargrave, just a\r\nlittle flushed, his dark eyes sparkling with unwonted vivacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99re come, Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I wish\r\nyou could have got Ralph to come too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUtterly impossible, dear Milicent,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cI had much ado\r\nto get away myself. Ralph attempted to keep me by violence; Huntingdon\r\nthreatened me with the eternal loss of his friendship; and Grimsby,\r\nworse than all, endeavoured to make me ashamed of my virtue, by such\r\ngalling sarcasms and innuendoes as he knew would wound me the most. So\r\nyou see, ladies, you ought to make me welcome when I have braved and\r\nsuffered so much for the favour of your sweet society.\xe2\x80\x9d He smilingly\r\nturned to me and bowed as he finished the sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he _handsome_ now, Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Milicent, her sisterly\r\npride overcoming, for the moment, all other considerations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cif that brilliance of eye, and lip, and\r\ncheek were natural to him; but look again, a few hours hence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the gentleman took a seat near me at the table, and petitioned for\r\na cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consider this an apt illustration of heaven taken by storm,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, as I handed one to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am in paradise, now; but I have fought\r\nmy way through flood and fire to win it. Ralph Hattersley\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nresource was to set his back against the door, and swear I should find\r\nno passage but through his body (a pretty substantial one too).\r\nHappily, however, that was not the only door, and I effected my escape\r\nby the side entrance through the butler\xe2\x80\x99s pantry, to the infinite\r\namazement of Benson, who was cleaning the plate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hargrave laughed, and so did his cousin; but his sister and I\r\nremained silent and grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon my levity, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he, more seriously, as he\r\nraised his eyes to my face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not used to these things: you\r\nsuffer them to affect your delicate mind too sensibly. But I thought of\r\nyou in the midst of those lawless roysterers; and I endeavoured to\r\npersuade Mr. Huntingdon to think of you too; but to no purpose: I fear\r\nhe is fully determined to enjoy himself this night; and it will be no\r\nuse keeping the coffee waiting for him or his companions; it will be\r\nmuch if they join us at tea. Meantime, I earnestly wish I could banish\r\nthe thoughts of them from your mind\xe2\x80\x94and my own too, for I hate to think\r\nof them\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94even of my dear friend Huntingdon, when I consider the\r\npower he possesses over the happiness of one so immeasurably superior\r\nto himself, and the use he makes of it\xe2\x80\x94I positively _detest_ the man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not say so to me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, bad as he is, he\r\nis part of myself, and you cannot abuse him without offending me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, then, for I would sooner die than offend you. But let us\r\nsay no more of him for the present, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last they came; but not till after ten, when tea, which had been\r\ndelayed for more than half an hour, was nearly over. Much as I had\r\nlonged for their coming, my heart failed me at the riotous uproar of\r\ntheir approach; and Milicent turned pale, and almost started from her\r\nseat, as Mr. Hattersley burst into the room with a clamorous volley of\r\noaths in his mouth, which Hargrave endeavoured to check by entreating\r\nhim to remember the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you do well to remind me of the ladies, you dastardly deserter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried he, shaking his formidable fist at his brother-in-law. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\r\nwere not for them, you well know, I\xe2\x80\x99d demolish you in the twinkling of\r\nan eye, and give your body to the fowls of heaven and the lilies of the\r\nfields!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, planting a chair by Lady Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s side, he stationed\r\nhimself in it, and began to talk to her with a mixture of absurdity and\r\nimpudence that seemed rather to amuse than to offend her; though she\r\naffected to resent his insolence, and to keep him at bay with sallies\r\nof smart and spirited repartee.\r\n\r\nMeantime Mr. Grimsby seated himself by me, in the chair vacated by\r\nHargrave as they entered, and gravely stated that he would thank me for\r\na cup of tea: and Arthur placed himself beside poor Milicent,\r\nconfidentially pushing his head into her face, and drawing in closer to\r\nher as she shrank away from him. He was not so noisy as Hattersley, but\r\nhis face was exceedingly flushed: he laughed incessantly, and while I\r\nblushed for all I saw and heard of him, I was glad that he chose to\r\ntalk to his companion in so low a tone that no one could hear what he\r\nsaid but herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fools they are!\xe2\x80\x9d drawled Mr. Grimsby, who had been talking away,\r\nat my elbow, with sententious gravity all the time; but I had been too\r\nmuch absorbed in contemplating the deplorable state of the other\r\ntwo\xe2\x80\x94especially Arthur\xe2\x80\x94to attend to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear such nonsense as they talk, Mrs. Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite ashamed of them for my part: they can\xe2\x80\x99t take so\r\nmuch as a bottle between them without its getting into their heads\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are pouring the cream into your saucer, Mr. Grimsby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, I see, but we\xe2\x80\x99re almost in darkness here. Hargrave, snuff\r\nthose candles, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re wax; they don\xe2\x80\x99t require snuffing,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The light of the body is the eye,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d observed Hargrave, with a\r\nsarcastic smile. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If thine eye be _single_, thy whole body shall be\r\nfull of light.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimsby repulsed him with a solemn wave of the hand, and then turning\r\nto me, continued, with the same drawling tones and strange uncertainty\r\nof utterance and heavy gravity of aspect as before: \xe2\x80\x9cBut as I was\r\nsaying, Mrs. Huntingdon, they have no head at all: they can\xe2\x80\x99t take half\r\na bottle without being affected some way; whereas I\xe2\x80\x94well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken\r\nthree times as much as they have to-night, and you see I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly\r\nsteady. Now that may strike you as very singular, but I think I can\r\nexplain it: you see _their_ brains\xe2\x80\x94I mention no names, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nunderstand to whom I allude\xe2\x80\x94_their_ brains are light to begin with, and\r\nthe fumes of the fermented liquor render them lighter still, and\r\nproduce an entire light-headedness, or giddiness, resulting in\r\nintoxication; whereas my brains, being composed of more solid\r\nmaterials, will absorb a considerable quantity of this alcoholic vapour\r\nwithout the production of any sensible result\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will find a sensible result produced on that tea,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterrupted Mr. Hargrave, \xe2\x80\x9cby the quantity of sugar you have put into\r\nit. Instead of your usual complement of one lump, you have put in six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I so?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the philosopher, diving with his spoon into the\r\ncup, and bringing up several half-dissolved pieces in confirmation of\r\nthe assertion. \xe2\x80\x9cHum! I perceive. Thus, Madam, you see the evil of\r\nabsence of mind\xe2\x80\x94of thinking too much while engaged in the common\r\nconcerns of life. Now, if I had had my wits about me, like ordinary\r\nmen, instead of within me like a philosopher, I should not have spoiled\r\nthis cup of tea, and been constrained to trouble you for another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the sugar-basin, Mr. Grimsby. Now you have spoiled the sugar\r\ntoo; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you to ring for some more, for here is Lord\r\nLowborough at last; and I hope his lordship will condescend to sit down\r\nwith us, such as we are, and allow me to give him some tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis lordship gravely bowed in answer to my appeal, but said nothing.\r\nMeantime, Hargrave volunteered to ring for the sugar, while Grimsby\r\nlamented his mistake, and attempted to prove that it was owing to the\r\nshadow of the urn and the badness of the lights.\r\n\r\nLord Lowborough had entered a minute or two before, unobserved by\r\nanyone but me, and had been standing before the door, grimly surveying\r\nthe company. He now stepped up to Annabella, who sat with her back\r\ntowards him, with Hattersley still beside her, though not now attending\r\nto her, being occupied in vociferously abusing and bullying his host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Annabella,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband, as he leant over the back of her\r\nchair, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich of these three \xe2\x80\x98bold, manly spirits\xe2\x80\x99 would you have me to\r\nresemble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy heaven and earth, you shall resemble us all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hattersley,\r\nstarting up and rudely seizing him by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Huntingdon!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshouted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ got him! Come, man, and help me! And d\xe2\x80\x94n me, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake him drunk before I let him go! He shall make up for all past\r\ndelinquencies as sure as I\xe2\x80\x99m a living soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere followed a disgraceful contest: Lord Lowborough, in desperate\r\nearnest, and pale with anger, silently struggling to release himself\r\nfrom the powerful madman that was striving to drag him from the room. I\r\nattempted to urge Arthur to interfere in behalf of his outraged guest,\r\nbut he could do nothing but laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuntingdon, you fool, come and help me, can\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hattersley,\r\nhimself somewhat weakened by his excesses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m wishing you God-speed, Hattersley,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Arthur, \xe2\x80\x9cand aiding you\r\nwith my prayers: I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything else if my life depended on it!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m quite used up. Oh\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x9d and leaning back in his seat, he clapped his\r\nhands on his sides and groaned aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnnabella, give me a candle!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lowborough, whose antagonist had\r\nnow got him round the waist and was endeavouring to root him from the\r\ndoor-post, to which he madly clung with all the energy of desperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ shall take no part in your rude sports!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady coldly\r\ndrawing back. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you can expect it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I snatched up a candle and brought it to him. He took it and held\r\nthe flame to Hattersley\xe2\x80\x99s hands, till, roaring like a wild beast, the\r\nlatter unclasped them and let him go. He vanished, I suppose to his own\r\napartment, for nothing more was seen of him till the morning. Swearing\r\nand cursing like a maniac, Hattersley threw himself on to the ottoman\r\nbeside the window. The door being now free, Milicent attempted to make\r\nher escape from the scene of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s disgrace; but he called her\r\nback, and insisted upon her coming to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, Ralph?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, reluctantly approaching him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pulling her on to\r\nhis knee like a child. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you crying for, Milicent?\xe2\x80\x94Tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not crying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted he, rudely pulling her hands from her face. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ndare you tell such a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not crying now,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have been, and just this minute too; and I _will_ know what\r\nfor. Come, now, you _shall_ tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo let me alone, Ralph! Remember, we are not at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter: you _shall_ answer my question!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her tormentor;\r\nand he attempted to extort the confession by shaking her, and\r\nremorselessly crushing her slight arms in the gripe of his powerful\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let him treat your sister in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to Mr. Hargrave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, Hattersley, I can\xe2\x80\x99t allow that,\xe2\x80\x9d said that gentleman,\r\nstepping up to the ill-assorted couple. \xe2\x80\x9cLet my sister alone, if you\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he made an effort to unclasp the ruffian\xe2\x80\x99s fingers from her arm,\r\nbut was suddenly driven backward, and nearly laid upon the floor by a\r\nviolent blow on the chest, accompanied with the admonition, \xe2\x80\x9cTake that\r\nfor your insolence! and learn to interfere between me and mine again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were not drunk, I\xe2\x80\x99d have satisfaction for that!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped\r\nHargrave, white and breathless as much from passion as from the\r\nimmediate effects of the blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d responded his brother-in-law. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Milicent, tell\r\nme what you were crying for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you some other time,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we are alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me now!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with another shake and a squeeze that made her\r\ndraw in her breath and bite her lip to suppress a cry of pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ tell you, Mr. Hattersley,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was crying from pure\r\nshame and humiliation for you; because she could not bear to see you\r\nconduct yourself so disgracefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound you, Madam!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered he, with a stare of stupid amazement at\r\nmy \xe2\x80\x9cimpudence.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt was _not_ that\xe2\x80\x94was it, Milicent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, speak up, child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell now,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can say \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 as well as \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, hanging her head, and blushing at the awful\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse you for an impertinent hussy, then!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, throwing her from\r\nhim with such violence that she fell on her side; but she was up again\r\nbefore either I or her brother could come to her assistance, and made\r\nthe best of her way out of the room, and, I suppose, up-stairs, without\r\nloss of time.\r\n\r\nThe next object of assault was Arthur, who sat opposite, and had, no\r\ndoubt, richly enjoyed the whole scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his irascible friend, \xe2\x80\x9cI WILL NOT have you\r\nsitting there and laughing like an idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Hattersley,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, wiping his swimming eyes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be the\r\ndeath of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will, but not as you suppose: I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the heart out of your\r\nbody, man, if you irritate me with any more of that imbecile\r\nlaughter!\xe2\x80\x94What! are you at it yet?\xe2\x80\x94There! see if that\xe2\x80\x99ll settle you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Hattersley, snatching up a footstool and hurting it at the head\r\nof his host; but he as well as missed his aim, and the latter still sat\r\ncollapsed and quaking with feeble laughter, with tears running down his\r\nface: a deplorable spectacle indeed.\r\n\r\nHattersley tried cursing and swearing, but it would not do: he then\r\ntook a number of books from the table beside him, and threw them, one\r\nby one, at the object of his wrath; but Arthur only laughed the more;\r\nand, finally, Hattersley rushed upon him in a frenzy and seizing him by\r\nthe shoulders, gave him a violent shaking, under which he laughed and\r\nshrieked alarmingly. But I saw no more: I thought I had witnessed\r\nenough of my husband\xe2\x80\x99s degradation; and leaving Annabella and the rest\r\nto follow when they pleased, I withdrew, but not to bed. Dismissing\r\nRachel to her rest, I walked up and down my room, in an agony of misery\r\nfor what had been done, and suspense, not knowing what might further\r\nhappen, or how or when that unhappy creature would come up to bed.\r\n\r\nAt last he came, slowly and stumblingly ascending the stairs, supported\r\nby Grimsby and Hattersley, who neither of them walked quite steadily\r\nthemselves, but were both laughing and joking at him, and making noise\r\nenough for all the servants to hear. He himself was no longer laughing\r\nnow, but sick and stupid. I will write no more about _that_.\r\n\r\nSuch disgraceful scenes (or nearly such) have been repeated more than\r\nonce. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say much to Arthur about it, for, if I did, it would do\r\nmore harm than good; but I let him know that I intensely dislike such\r\nexhibitions; and each time he has promised they should never again be\r\nrepeated. But I fear he is losing the little self-command and\r\nself-respect he once possessed: formerly, he would have been ashamed to\r\nact thus\xe2\x80\x94at least, before any other witnesses than his boon companions,\r\nor such as they. His friend Hargrave, with a prudence and\r\nself-government that I envy for _him_, never disgraces himself by\r\ntaking more than sufficient to render him a little \xe2\x80\x9celevated,\xe2\x80\x9d and is\r\nalways the first to leave the table after Lord Lowborough, who, wiser\r\nstill, perseveres in vacating the dining-room immediately after us: but\r\nnever once, since Annabella offended him so deeply, has he entered the\r\ndrawing-room before the rest; always spending the interim in the\r\nlibrary, which I take care to have lighted for his accommodation; or,\r\non fine moonlight nights, in roaming about the grounds. But I think she\r\nregrets her misconduct, for she has never repeated it since, and of\r\nlate she has comported herself with wonderful propriety towards him,\r\ntreating him with more uniform kindness and consideration than ever I\r\nhave observed her to do before. I date the time of this improvement\r\nfrom the period when she ceased to hope and strive for Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 5th.\xe2\x80\x94Esther Hargrave is getting a fine girl. She is not out of\r\nthe school-room yet, but her mother frequently brings her over to call\r\nin the mornings when the gentlemen are out, and sometimes she spends an\r\nhour or two in company with her sister and me, and the children; and\r\nwhen we go to the Grove, I always contrive to see her, and talk more to\r\nher than to any one else, for I am very much attached to my little\r\nfriend, and so is she to me. I wonder what she can see to like in me\r\nthough, for I am no longer the happy, lively girl I used to be; but she\r\nhas no other society, save that of her uncongenial mother, and her\r\ngoverness (as artificial and conventional a person as that prudent\r\nmother could procure to rectify the pupil\xe2\x80\x99s natural qualities), and,\r\nnow and then, her subdued, quiet sister. I often wonder what will be\r\n_her_ lot in life, and so does she; but _her_ speculations on the\r\nfuture are full of buoyant hope; so were mine once. I shudder to think\r\nof her being awakened, like me, to a sense of their delusive vanity. It\r\nseems as if I should feel her disappointment, even more deeply than my\r\nown. I feel almost as if I were born for such a fate, but _she_ is so\r\njoyous and fresh, so light of heart and free of spirit, and so\r\nguileless and unsuspecting too. Oh, it would be cruel to make her feel\r\nas I feel now, and know what I have known!\r\n\r\nHer sister trembles for her too. Yesterday morning, one of October\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrightest, loveliest days, Milicent and I were in the garden enjoying a\r\nbrief half-hour together with our children, while Annabella was lying\r\non the drawing-room sofa, deep in the last new novel. We had been\r\nromping with the little creatures, almost as merry and wild as\r\nthemselves, and now paused in the shade of the tall copper beech, to\r\nrecover breath and rectify our hair, disordered by the rough play and\r\nthe frolicsome breeze, while they toddled together along the broad,\r\nsunny walk; my Arthur supporting the feebler steps of her little Helen,\r\nand sagaciously pointing out to her the brightest beauties of the\r\nborder as they passed, with semi-articulate prattle, that did as well\r\nfor her as any other mode of discourse. From laughing at the pretty\r\nsight, we began to talk of the children\xe2\x80\x99s future life; and that made us\r\nthoughtful. We both relapsed into silent musing as we slowly proceeded\r\nup the walk; and I suppose Milicent, by a train of associations, was\r\nled to think of her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou often see Esther, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have more frequent opportunities of meeting her than I have;\r\nand she loves you, I know, and reverences you too: there is nobody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion she thinks so much of; and she says you have more sense than\r\nmamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because she is self-willed, and my opinions more generally\r\ncoincide with her own than your mamma\xe2\x80\x99s. But what then, Milicent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, since you have so much influence with her, I wish you would\r\nseriously impress it upon her, never, on any account, or for anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersuasion, to marry for the sake of money, or rank, or establishment,\r\nor any earthly thing, but true affection and well-grounded esteem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we have had some\r\ndiscourse on that subject already, and I assure you her ideas of love\r\nand matrimony are as romantic as any one could desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut romantic notions will not do: I want her to have true notions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery right: but in my judgment, what the world stigmatises as\r\nromantic, is often more nearly allied to the truth than is commonly\r\nsupposed; for, if the generous ideas of youth are too often\r\nover-clouded by the sordid views of after-life, that scarcely proves\r\nthem to be false.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but if you think her ideas are what they ought to be, strengthen\r\nthem, will you? and confirm them, as far as you can; for _I_ had\r\nromantic notions once, and\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that I regret my lot,\r\nfor I am quite sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are contented for yourself, but you\r\nwould not have your sister to suffer the same as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94or worse. She might have far worse to suffer than I, for _I am_\r\nreally contented, Helen, though you mayn\xe2\x80\x99t think it: I speak the solemn\r\ntruth in saying that I would not exchange my husband for any man on\r\nearth, if I might do it by the plucking of this leaf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I believe you: now that you have him, you would not exchange him\r\nfor another; but then you would gladly exchange some of his qualities\r\nfor those of better men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: just as I would gladly exchange some of my own qualities for\r\nthose of better women; for neither he nor I are perfect, and I desire\r\nhis improvement as earnestly as my own. And he will improve, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink so, Helen? he\xe2\x80\x99s only six-and-twenty yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will, he WILL!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse the faintness of my acquiescence, Milicent, I would not\r\ndiscourage your hopes for the world, but mine have been so often\r\ndisappointed, that I am become as cold and doubtful in my expectations\r\nas the flattest of octogenarians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you do hope, still, even for Mr. Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, I confess, \xe2\x80\x98even\xe2\x80\x99 for _him;_ for it seems as if life and hope\r\nmust cease together. And is he so _much_ worse, Milicent, than Mr.\r\nHattersley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to give you my candid opinion, I think there is no comparison\r\nbetween them. But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be offended, Helen, for you know I always\r\nspeak my mind, and you may speak yours too. I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not offended, love; and my opinion is, that if there _be_ a\r\ncomparison made between the two, the difference, for the most part, is\r\ncertainly in Hattersley\xe2\x80\x99s favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilicent\xe2\x80\x99s own heart told her how much it cost me to make this\r\nacknowledgment; and, with a childlike impulse, she expressed her\r\nsympathy by suddenly kissing my cheek, without a word of reply, and\r\nthen turning quickly away, caught up her baby, and hid her face in its\r\nfrock. How odd it is that we so often weep for each other\xe2\x80\x99s distresses,\r\nwhen we shed not a tear for our own! Her heart had been full enough of\r\nher own sorrows, but it overflowed at the idea of mine; and I, too,\r\nshed tears at the sight of her sympathetic emotion, though I had not\r\nwept for myself for many a week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was one rainy day last week; most of the company were killing time\r\nin the billiard-room, but Milicent and I were with little Arthur and\r\nHelen in the library, and between our books, our children, and each\r\nother, we expected to make out a very agreeable morning. We had not\r\nbeen thus secluded above two hours, however, when Mr. Hattersley came\r\nin, attracted, I suppose, by the voice of his child, as he was crossing\r\nthe hall, for he is prodigiously fond of her, and she of him.\r\n\r\nHe was redolent of the stables, where he had been regaling himself with\r\nthe company of his fellow-creatures the horses ever since breakfast.\r\nBut that was no matter to my little namesake; as soon as the colossal\r\nperson of her father darkened the door, she uttered a shrill scream of\r\ndelight, and, quitting her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, ran crowing towards him,\r\nbalancing her course with outstretched arms, and embracing his knee,\r\nthrew back her head and laughed in his face. He might well look\r\nsmilingly down upon those small, fair features, radiant with innocent\r\nmirth, those clear blue shining eyes, and that soft flaxen hair cast\r\nback upon the little ivory neck and shoulders. Did he not think how\r\nunworthy he was of such a possession? I fear no such idea crossed his\r\nmind. He caught her up, and there followed some minutes of very rough\r\nplay, during which it is difficult to say whether the father or the\r\ndaughter laughed and shouted the loudest. At length, however, the\r\nboisterous pastime terminated, suddenly, as might be expected: the\r\nlittle one was hurt, and began to cry; and the ungentle play-fellow\r\ntossed it into its mother\xe2\x80\x99s lap, bidding her \xe2\x80\x9cmake all straight.\xe2\x80\x9d As\r\nhappy to return to that gentle comforter as it had been to leave her,\r\nthe child nestled in her arms, and hushed its cries in a moment; and\r\nsinking its little weary head on her bosom, soon dropped asleep.\r\n\r\nMeantime Mr. Hattersley strode up to the fire, and interposing his\r\nheight and breadth between us and it, stood with arms akimbo, expanding\r\nhis chest, and gazing round him as if the house and all its\r\nappurtenances and contents were his own undisputed possessions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeuced bad weather this!\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be no shooting to-day, I\r\nguess.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, suddenly lifting up his voice, he regaled us with a few\r\nbars of a rollicking song, which abruptly ceasing, he finished the tune\r\nwith a whistle, and then continued:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Mrs. Huntingdon, what a\r\nfine stud your husband has! not large, but good. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at\r\nthem a bit this morning; and upon my word, Black Boss, and Grey Tom,\r\nand that young Nimrod are the finest animals I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen for many a day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen followed a particular discussion of their various merits,\r\nsucceeded by a sketch of the great things _he_ intended to do in the\r\nhorse-jockey line, when his old governor thought proper to quit the\r\nstage. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that I wish him to close his accounts,\xe2\x80\x9d added he: \xe2\x80\x9cthe old\r\nTrojan is welcome to keep his books open as long as he pleases for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, _indeed_, Mr. Hattersley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! It\xe2\x80\x99s only my way of talking. The event must come some time,\r\nand so I look to the bright side of it: that\xe2\x80\x99s the right plan\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nMrs. H.? What are you two doing here? By-the-by, where\xe2\x80\x99s Lady\r\nLowborough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the billiard-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a splendid creature she _is!_\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, fixing his eyes on\r\nhis wife, who changed colour, and looked more and more disconcerted as\r\nhe proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a noble figure she has; and what magnificent black\r\neyes; and what a fine spirit of her own; and what a tongue of her own,\r\ntoo, when she likes to use it. I perfectly adore her! But never mind,\r\nMilicent: I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have her for my wife, not if she\xe2\x80\x99d a kingdom for\r\nher dowry! I\xe2\x80\x99m better satisfied with the one I have. Now _then!_ what\r\ndo you look so sulky for? don\xe2\x80\x99t you believe me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, in a tone of half sad, half sullen\r\nresignation, as she turned away to stroke the hair of her sleeping\r\ninfant, that she had laid on the sofa beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _then_, what makes you so cross? Come here, Milly, and tell me\r\nwhy you can\xe2\x80\x99t be satisfied with my assurance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went, and putting her little hand within his arm, looked up in his\r\nface, and said softly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it amount to, Ralph? Only to this, that though you admire\r\nAnnabella so much, and for qualities that I don\xe2\x80\x99t possess, you would\r\nstill rather have me than her for your wife, which merely proves that\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t think it necessary to love your wife; you are satisfied if\r\nshe can keep your house, and take care of your child. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ncross; I\xe2\x80\x99m only sorry; for,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, in a low, tremulous accent,\r\nwithdrawing her hand from his arm, and bending her looks on the rug,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me, you don\xe2\x80\x99t, and it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true; but who told you I didn\xe2\x80\x99t? Did I say I loved Annabella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you adored her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, but adoration isn\xe2\x80\x99t love. I adore Annabella, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t love\r\nher; and I love thee, Milicent, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t adore thee.\xe2\x80\x9d In proof of\r\nhis affection, he clutched a handful of her light brown ringlets, and\r\nappeared to twist them unmercifully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really, Ralph?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, with a faint smile beaming\r\nthrough her tears, just putting up her hand to his, in token that he\r\npulled _rather_ too hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure I do,\xe2\x80\x9d responded he: \xe2\x80\x9conly you bother me rather,\r\nsometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ bother you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, in very natural surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _you_\xe2\x80\x94but only by your exceeding goodness. When a boy has been\r\neating raisins and sugar-plums all day, he longs for a squeeze of sour\r\norange by way of a change. And did you never, Milly, observe the sands\r\non the sea-shore; how nice and smooth they look, and how soft and easy\r\nthey feel to the foot? But if you plod along, for half an hour, over\r\nthis soft, easy carpet\xe2\x80\x94giving way at every step, yielding the more the\r\nharder you press,\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it rather wearisome work, and be glad\r\nenough to come to a bit of good, firm rock, that won\xe2\x80\x99t budge an inch\r\nwhether you stand, walk, or stamp upon it; and, though it be hard as\r\nthe nether millstone, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it the easier footing after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you mean, Ralph,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, nervously playing with her\r\nwatchguard and tracing the figure on the rug with the point of her tiny\r\nfoot\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you mean: but I thought you always liked to be\r\nyielded to, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t alter now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do like it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, bringing her to him by another tug at her\r\nhair. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind my talk, Milly. A man must have something to\r\ngrumble about; and if he can\xe2\x80\x99t complain that his wife harries him to\r\ndeath with her perversity and ill-humour, he must complain that she\r\nwears him out with her kindness and gentleness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why complain at all, unless because you are tired and\r\ndissatisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo excuse my own failings, to be sure. Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear all the\r\nburden of my sins on my own shoulders, as long as there\xe2\x80\x99s another ready\r\nto help me, with none of her own to carry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such one on earth,\xe2\x80\x9d said she seriously; and then, taking\r\nhis hand from her head, she kissed it with an air of genuine devotion,\r\nand tripped away to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tidy my hair,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, smiling through her disordered locks;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve made it all come down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff with you then!\xe2\x80\x94An excellent little woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked when she\r\nwas gone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a thought too soft\xe2\x80\x94she almost melts in one\xe2\x80\x99s hands. I\r\npositively think I ill-use her sometimes, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken too much\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, for she never complains, either at the time or after.\r\nI suppose she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can enlighten you on that subject, Mr. Hattersley,\xe2\x80\x9d said I: \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\n_does_ mind it; and some other things she minds still more, which yet\r\nyou may never hear her complain of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x94does she complain to you?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded he, with a sudden\r\nspark of fury ready to burst into a flame if I should answer \xe2\x80\x98yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have known her longer and studied her more\r\nclosely than you have done.\xe2\x80\x94And I can tell you, Mr. Hattersley, that\r\nMilicent loves you more than you deserve, and that you have it in your\r\npower to make her very happy, instead of which you are her evil genius,\r\nand, I will venture to say, there is not a single day passes in which\r\nyou do not inflict upon her some pang that you might spare her if you\r\nwould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s not _my_ fault,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, gazing carelessly up at the\r\nceiling and plunging his hands into his pockets: \xe2\x80\x9cif my ongoings don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuit her, she should tell me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she not exactly the wife you wanted? Did you not tell Mr.\r\nHuntingdon you must have one that would submit to anything without a\r\nmurmur, and never blame you, whatever you did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, but we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t always have what we want: it spoils the best of\r\nus, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? How can I help playing the deuce when I see it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\none to her whether I behave like a Christian or like a scoundrel, such\r\nas nature made me? and how can I help teasing her when she\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ninvitingly meek and mim, when she lies down like a spaniel at my feet\r\nand never so much as squeaks to tell me that\xe2\x80\x99s enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a tyrant by nature, the temptation is strong, I allow; but\r\nno generous mind delights to oppress the weak, but rather to cherish\r\nand protect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ oppress her; but it\xe2\x80\x99s so confounded flat to be always\r\ncherishing and protecting; and then, how can I tell that I _am_\r\noppressing her when she \xe2\x80\x98melts away and makes no sign\xe2\x80\x99? I sometimes\r\nthink she has no feeling at all; and then I go on till she cries, and\r\nthat satisfies me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you _do_ delight to oppress her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t, I tell you! only when I\xe2\x80\x99m in a bad humour, or a particularly\r\ngood one, and want to afflict for the pleasure of comforting; or when\r\nshe looks flat and wants shaking up a bit. And sometimes she provokes\r\nme by crying for nothing, and won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what it\xe2\x80\x99s for; and then, I\r\nallow, it enrages me past bearing, especially when I\xe2\x80\x99m not my own man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs is no doubt generally the case on such occasions,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in\r\nfuture, Mr. Hattersley, when you see her looking flat, or crying for\r\n\xe2\x80\x98nothing\xe2\x80\x99 (as you call it), ascribe it all to yourself: be assured it\r\nis something you have done amiss, or your general misconduct, that\r\ndistresses her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. If it were, she should tell me so: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthat way of moping and fretting in silence, and saying nothing: it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot honest. How can she expect me to mend my ways at that rate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she gives you credit for having more sense than you possess,\r\nand deludes herself with the hope that you will one day see your own\r\nerrors and repair them, if left to your own reflection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of your sneers, Mrs. Huntingdon. I _have_ the sense to see that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not always quite correct, but sometimes I think that\xe2\x80\x99s no great\r\nmatter, as long as I injure nobody but myself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ a great matter,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted I, \xe2\x80\x9cboth to yourself (as you will\r\nhereafter find to your cost) and to all connected with you, most\r\nespecially your wife. But, indeed, it is nonsense to talk about\r\ninjuring no one but yourself: it is impossible to injure yourself,\r\nespecially by such acts as we allude to, without injuring hundreds, if\r\nnot thousands, besides, in a greater or less, degree, either by the\r\nevil you do or the good you leave undone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as I was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cor would have said if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntaken me up so short, I sometimes think I should do better if I were\r\njoined to one that would always remind me when I was wrong, and give me\r\na motive for doing good and eschewing evil, by decidedly showing her\r\napproval of the one and disapproval of the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had no higher motive than the approval of your fellow-mortal,\r\nit would do you little good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but if I had a mate that would not always be yielding, and\r\nalways equally kind, but that would have the spirit to stand at bay now\r\nand then, and honestly tell me her mind at all times, such a one as\r\nyourself for instance. Now, if I went on with you as I do with her when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in London, you\xe2\x80\x99d make the house too hot to hold me at times, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe sworn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mistake me: I\xe2\x80\x99m no termagant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all the better for that, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand contradiction, in a\r\ngeneral way, and I\xe2\x80\x99m as fond of my own will as another; only I think\r\ntoo much of it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer for any man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I would never contradict you without a cause, but certainly I\r\nwould always let you know what I thought of your conduct; and if you\r\noppressed me, in body, mind, or estate, you should at least have no\r\nreason to suppose \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that, my lady; and I think if my little wife were to follow the\r\nsame plan, it would be better for us both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, let her be; there\xe2\x80\x99s much to be said on both sides, and, now I\r\nthink upon it, Huntingdon often regrets that you are not more like her,\r\nscoundrelly dog that he is, and you see, after all, you can\xe2\x80\x99t reform\r\n_him:_ he\xe2\x80\x99s _ten_ times worse than I. He\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of you, to be sure;\r\nthat is, he\xe2\x80\x99s always on his best behaviour in your presence\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what his worst behaviour is like, then?\xe2\x80\x9d I could not forbear\r\nobserving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to tell you the truth, it\xe2\x80\x99s very bad indeed\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Hargrave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, addressing that gentleman, who had entered the room\r\nunperceived by me, for I was now standing near the fire, with my back\r\nto the door. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cas great a reprobate as\r\never was d\xe2\x80\x94d?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis lady will not hear him censured with impunity,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr.\r\nHargrave, coming forward; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must say, I thank God I am not such\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it would become you better,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cto look at what you are,\r\nand say, \xe2\x80\x98God be merciful to me a sinner.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are severe,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he, bowing slightly and drawing himself up\r\nwith a proud yet injured air. Hattersley laughed, and clapped him on\r\nthe shoulder. Moving from under his hand with a gesture of insulted\r\ndignity, Mr. Hargrave took himself away to the other end of the rug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a shame, Mrs. Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d cried his brother-in-law; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nstruck Walter Hargrave when I was drunk, the second night after we\r\ncame, and he\xe2\x80\x99s turned a cold shoulder on me ever since; though I asked\r\nhis pardon the very morning after it was done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour manner of asking it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, \xe2\x80\x9cand the clearness with\r\nwhich you remembered the whole transaction, showed you were not too\r\ndrunk to be fully conscious of what you were about, and quite\r\nresponsible for the deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to interfere between me and my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled Hattersley,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand that is enough to provoke any man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou justify it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said his opponent, darting upon him a most\r\nvindictive glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I tell you I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been under\r\nexcitement; and if you choose to bear malice for it after all the\r\nhandsome things I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, do so and be d\xe2\x80\x94d!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _would_ refrain from such language in a _lady\xe2\x80\x99s_ presence, at\r\nleast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hargrave, hiding his anger under a mask of disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I said?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hattersley: \xe2\x80\x9cnothing but heaven\xe2\x80\x99s truth.\r\nHe will be damned, won\xe2\x80\x99t he, Mrs. Huntingdon, if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s trespasses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to forgive him, Mr. Hargrave, since he asks you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you say so? Then I will!\xe2\x80\x9d And, smiling almost frankly, he stepped\r\nforward and offered his hand. It was immediately clasped in that of his\r\nrelative, and the reconciliation was apparently cordial on both sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe affront,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hargrave, turning to me, \xe2\x80\x9cowed half its\r\nbitterness to the fact of its being offered in your presence; and since\r\nyou bid me forgive it, I will, and forget it too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess the best return I can make will be to take myself off,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmuttered Hattersley, with a broad grin. His companion smiled, and he\r\nleft the room. This put me on my guard. Mr. Hargrave turned seriously\r\nto me, and earnestly began,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mrs. Huntingdon, how I have longed for, yet dreaded, this hour!\r\nDo not be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, for my face was crimson with anger: \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot about to offend you with any useless entreaties or complaints. I am\r\nnot going to presume to trouble you with the mention of my own feelings\r\nor your perfections, but I have something to reveal to you which you\r\nought to know, and which, yet, it pains me inexpressibly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to reveal it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is of importance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so I shall hear it soon enough, especially if it is bad news, as\r\nyou seem to consider it. At present I am going to take the children to\r\nthe nursery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can\xe2\x80\x99t you ring and send them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I want the exercise of a run to the top of the house. Come,\r\nArthur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; don\xe2\x80\x99t wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen when may I see you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, departing with little Helen in one arm and leading\r\nArthur by the hand.\r\n\r\nHe turned away, muttering some sentence of impatient censure or\r\ncomplaint, in which \xe2\x80\x9cheartless\xe2\x80\x9d was the only distinguishable word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense is this, Mr. Hargrave?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, pausing in the doorway.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing; I did not intend you should hear my soliloquy. But the\r\nfact is, Mrs. Huntingdon, I have a disclosure to make, painful for me\r\nto offer as for you to hear; and I want you to give me a few minutes of\r\nyour attention in private at any time and place you like to appoint. It\r\nis from no selfish motive that I ask it, and not for any cause that\r\ncould alarm your superhuman purity: therefore you need not kill me with\r\nthat look of cold and pitiless disdain. I know too well the feelings\r\nwith which the bearers of bad tidings are commonly regarded not to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ this wonderful piece of intelligence?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, impatiently\r\ninterrupting him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is anything of real importance, speak it in\r\nthree words before I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn three words I cannot. Send those children away and stay with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; keep your bad tidings to yourself. I know it is something I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to hear, and something you would displease me by telling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have divined too truly, I fear; but still, since I know it, I feel\r\nit my duty to disclose it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, spare us both the infliction, and I will exonerate you from the\r\nduty. You have offered to tell; I have refused to hear: my ignorance\r\nwill not be charged on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so: you shall not hear it from me. But if the blow fall too\r\nsuddenly upon you when it comes, remember I wished to soften it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left him. I was determined his words should not alarm me. What could\r\n_he_, of all men, have to reveal that was of importance for _me_ to\r\nhear? It was no doubt some exaggerated tale about my unfortunate\r\nhusband that he wished to make the most of to serve his own bad\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n6th.\xe2\x80\x94He has not alluded to this momentous mystery since, and I have\r\nseen no reason to repent of my unwillingness to hear it. The threatened\r\nblow has not been struck yet, and I do not greatly fear it. At present\r\nI am pleased with Arthur: he has not positively disgraced himself for\r\nupwards of a fortnight, and all this last week has been so very\r\nmoderate in his indulgence at table that I can perceive a marked\r\ndifference in his general temper and appearance. Dare I hope this will\r\ncontinue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventh.\xe2\x80\x94Yes, I _will_ hope! To-night I heard Grimsby and Hattersley\r\ngrumbling together about the inhospitality of their host. They did not\r\nknow I was near, for I happened to be standing behind the curtain in\r\nthe bow of the window, watching the moon rising over the clump of tall\r\ndark elm-trees below the lawn, and wondering why Arthur was so\r\nsentimental as to stand without, leaning against the outer pillar of\r\nthe portico, apparently watching it too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, I suppose we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the last of our merry carousals in this\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hattersley; \xe2\x80\x9cI _thought_ his good-fellowship wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlast long. But,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it would meet its\r\nend this way. I rather thought our pretty hostess would be setting up\r\nher porcupine quills, and threatening to turn us out of the house if we\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind our manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t foresee _this_, then?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Grimsby, with a guttural\r\nchuckle. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99ll change again when he\xe2\x80\x99s sick of her. If we come here\r\na year or two hence, we shall have all our own way, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other: \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s not the style of woman you\r\nsoon tire of. But be that as it may, it\xe2\x80\x99s devilish provoking now that\r\nwe can\xe2\x80\x99t be jolly, because he chooses to be on his good behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all these cursed women!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Grimsby: \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re the very bane\r\nof the world! They bring trouble and discomfort wherever they come,\r\nwith their false, fair faces and their deceitful tongues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this juncture I issued from my retreat, and smiling on Mr. Grimsby\r\nas I passed, left the room and went out in search of Arthur. Having\r\nseen him bend his course towards the shrubbery, I followed him thither,\r\nand found him just entering the shadowy walk. I was so light of heart,\r\nso overflowing with affection, that I sprang upon him and clasped him\r\nin my arms. This startling conduct had a singular effect upon him:\r\nfirst, he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cBless you, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d and returned my close embrace\r\nwith a fervour like old times, and _then_ he started, and, in a tone of\r\nabsolute terror, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen! what the devil is this?\xe2\x80\x9d and I saw, by the faint light gleaming\r\nthrough the overshadowing tree, that he was positively pale with the\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nHow strange that the instinctive impulse of affection should come\r\nfirst, and then the shock of the surprise! It shows, at least, that the\r\naffection is genuine: he is not sick of me yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI startled you, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, laughing in my glee. \xe2\x80\x9cHow nervous you\r\nare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce did you do it for?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, quite testily,\r\nextricating himself from my arms, and wiping his forehead with his\r\nhandkerchief. \xe2\x80\x9cGo back, Helen\xe2\x80\x94go back directly! You\xe2\x80\x99ll get your death\r\nof cold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, till I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you what I came for. They are blaming you,\r\nArthur, for your temperance and sobriety, and I\xe2\x80\x99m come to thank you for\r\nit. They say it is all \xe2\x80\x98these cursed women,\xe2\x80\x99 and that we are the bane\r\nof the world; but don\xe2\x80\x99t let them laugh or grumble you out of your good\r\nresolutions, or your affection for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed. I squeezed him in my arms again, and cried in tearful\r\nearnest, \xe2\x80\x9cDo, do persevere! and I\xe2\x80\x99ll love you better than ever I did\r\nbefore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I will!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, hastily kissing me. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, now, go. You\r\nmad creature, how _could_ you come out in your light evening dress this\r\nchill autumn night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a glorious night,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a night that will give you your death, in another minute. Run\r\naway, do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see my death among those trees, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, for he was\r\ngazing intently at the shrubs, as if he saw it coming, and I was\r\nreluctant to leave him, in my new-found happiness and revival of hope\r\nand love. But he grew angry at my delay, so I kissed him and ran back\r\nto the house.\r\n\r\nI was in such a good humour that night: Milicent told me I was the life\r\nof the party, and whispered she had never seen me so brilliant.\r\nCertainly, I talked enough for twenty, and smiled upon them all.\r\nGrimsby, Hattersley, Hargrave, Lady Lowborough, all shared my sisterly\r\nkindness. Grimsby stared and wondered; Hattersley laughed and jested\r\n(in spite of the little wine he had been suffered to imbibe), but still\r\nbehaved as well as he knew how. Hargrave and Annabella, from different\r\nmotives and in different ways, emulated me, and doubtless both\r\nsurpassed me, the former in his discursive versatility and eloquence,\r\nthe latter in boldness and animation at least. Milicent, delighted to\r\nsee her husband, her brother, and her over-estimated friend acquitting\r\nthemselves so well, was lively and gay too, in her quiet way. Even Lord\r\nLowborough caught the general contagion: his dark greenish eyes were\r\nlighted up beneath their moody brows; his sombre countenance was\r\nbeautified by smiles; all traces of gloom and proud or cold reserve had\r\nvanished for the time; and he astonished us all, not only by his\r\ngeneral cheerfulness and animation, but by the positive flashes of true\r\nforce and brilliance he emitted from time to time. Arthur did not talk\r\nmuch, but he laughed, and listened to the rest, and was in perfect\r\ngood-humour, though not excited by wine. So that, altogether, we made a\r\nvery merry, innocent, and entertaining party.\r\n\r\n9th.\xe2\x80\x94Yesterday, when Rachel came to dress me for dinner, I saw that she\r\nhad been crying. I wanted to know the cause of it, but she seemed\r\nreluctant to tell. Was she unwell? No. Had she heard bad news from her\r\nfriends? No. Had any of the servants vexed her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then, Rachel? Have you been reading novels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a sorrowful shake of the head; and then\r\nshe sighed and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cBut to tell you the truth, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike master\xe2\x80\x99s ways of going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Rachel? He\xe2\x80\x99s going on very properly at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, if you think so, it\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she went on dressing my hair, in a hurried way, quite unlike her\r\nusual calm, collected manner, murmuring, half to herself, she was sure\r\nit was beautiful hair: she \xe2\x80\x9ccould like to see \xe2\x80\x99em match it.\xe2\x80\x9d When it\r\nwas done, she fondly stroked it, and gently patted my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that affectionate ebullition intended for my hair, or myself,\r\nnurse?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, laughingly turning round upon her; but a tear was even\r\nnow in her eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _do_ you mean, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I was you, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have that Lady Lowborough in the house\r\nanother minute\xe2\x80\x94not another _minute_ I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\n\r\nI was thunderstruck; but before I could recover from the shock\r\nsufficiently to demand an explanation, Milicent entered my room, as she\r\nfrequently does when she is dressed before me; and she stayed with me\r\ntill it was time to go down. She must have found me a very unsociable\r\ncompanion this time, for Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s last words rang in my ears. But still\r\nI hoped, I trusted they had no foundation but in some idle rumour of\r\nthe servants from what they had seen in Lady Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s manner last\r\nmonth; or perhaps from something that had passed between their master\r\nand her during her former visit. At dinner I narrowly observed both her\r\nand Arthur, and saw nothing extraordinary in the conduct of either,\r\nnothing calculated to excite suspicion, except in distrustful minds,\r\nwhich mine was not, and therefore I would not suspect.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after dinner Annabella went out with her husband to\r\nshare his moonlight ramble, for it was a splendid evening like the\r\nlast. Mr. Hargrave entered the drawing-room a little before the others,\r\nand challenged me to a game of chess. He did it without any of that sad\r\nbut proud humility he usually assumes in addressing me, unless he is\r\nexcited with wine. I looked at his face to see if that was the case\r\nnow. His eye met mine keenly, but steadily: there was something about\r\nhim I did not understand, but he seemed sober enough. Not choosing to\r\nengage with him, I referred him to Milicent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe plays badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to match my skill with yours. Come\r\nnow! you can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend you are reluctant to lay down your work. I know\r\nyou never take it up except to pass an idle hour, when there is nothing\r\nbetter you can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut chess-players are so unsociable,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are no company\r\nfor any but themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one here but Milicent, and she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall be delighted to watch you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried our mutual friend. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo\r\n_such_ players\xe2\x80\x94it will be quite a treat! I wonder which will conquer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI consented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hargrave, as he arranged the men on the\r\nboard, speaking distinctly, and with a peculiar emphasis, as if he had\r\na double meaning to all his words, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a good player, but I am a\r\nbetter: we shall have a long game, and you will give me some trouble;\r\nbut I can be as patient as you, and in the end I shall certainly win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe fixed his eyes upon me with a glance I did not like, keen, crafty,\r\nbold, and almost impudent;\xe2\x80\x94already half triumphant in his anticipated\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not, Mr. Hargrave!\xe2\x80\x9d returned I, with vehemence that must have\r\nstartled Milicent at least; but _he_ only smiled and murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cTime\r\nwill show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe set to work: he sufficiently interested in the game, but calm and\r\nfearless in the consciousness of superior skill: I, intensely eager to\r\ndisappoint his expectations, for I considered this the type of a more\r\nserious contest, as I imagined he did, and I felt an almost\r\nsuperstitious dread of being beaten: at all events, I could ill endure\r\nthat present success should add one tittle to his conscious power (his\r\ninsolent self-confidence I ought to say), or encourage for a moment his\r\ndream of future conquest. His play was cautious and deep, but I\r\nstruggled hard against him. For some time the combat was doubtful: at\r\nlength, to my joy, the victory seemed inclining to my side: I had taken\r\nseveral of his best pieces, and manifestly baffled his projects. He put\r\nhis hand to his brow and paused, in evident perplexity. I rejoiced in\r\nmy advantage, but dared not glory in it yet. At length, he lifted his\r\nhead, and quietly making his move, looked at me and said, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nyou think you will win, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, taking his pawn that he had pushed into the way\r\nof my bishop with so careless an air that I thought it was an\r\noversight, but was not generous enough, under the circumstances, to\r\ndirect his attention to it, and too heedless, at the moment, to foresee\r\nthe after-consequences of my move. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is those bishops that trouble\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the bold knight can overleap the reverend\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d taking my last bishop with his knight; \xe2\x80\x9cand now, those\r\nsacred persons once removed, I shall carry all before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Walter, how you talk!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milicent; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has far more pieces\r\nthan you still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intend to give you some trouble yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cand perhaps, sir, you\r\nwill find yourself checkmated before you are aware. Look to your\r\nqueen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe combat deepened. The game was a long one, and I _did_ give him some\r\ntrouble: but he was a better player than I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat keen gamesters you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hattersley, who had now\r\nentered, and been watching us for some time. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mrs. Huntingdon,\r\nyour hand trembles as if you had staked your all upon it! and, Walter,\r\nyou dog, you look as deep and cool as if you were certain of success,\r\nand as keen and cruel as if you would drain her heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood! But if I\r\nwere you, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t beat her, for very fear: she\xe2\x80\x99ll hate you if you\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94she will, by heaven! I see it in her eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said I: his talk distracted me, for I was\r\ndriven to extremities. A few more moves, and I was inextricably\r\nentangled in the snare of my antagonist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheck,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he: I sought in agony some means of escape. \xe2\x80\x9cMate!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, quietly, but with evident delight. He had suspended the\r\nutterance of that last fatal syllable the better to enjoy my dismay. I\r\nwas foolishly disconcerted by the event. Hattersley laughed; Milicent\r\nwas troubled to see me so disturbed. Hargrave placed his hand on mine\r\nthat rested on the table, and squeezing it with a firm but gentle\r\npressure, murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cBeaten, beaten!\xe2\x80\x9d and gazed into my face with a\r\nlook where exultation was blended with an expression of ardour and\r\ntenderness yet more insulting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_No, never_, Mr. Hargrave!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed I, quickly withdrawing my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you deny?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, smilingly pointing to the board. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nanswered, recollecting how strange my conduct must appear: \xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nbeaten me in that game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you try another, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou acknowledge my superiority?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as a chess-player.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose to resume my work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Annabella?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hargrave, gravely, after glancing round the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone out with Lord Lowborough,\xe2\x80\x9d answered I, for he looked at me for a\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not yet returned!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, seriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d looking round again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone out with Grimsby, as you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hattersley, suppressing a\r\nlaugh, which broke forth as he concluded the sentence. Why did he\r\nlaugh? Why did Hargrave connect them thus together? Was it true, then?\r\nAnd was this the dreadful secret he had wished to reveal to me? I must\r\nknow, and that quickly. I instantly rose and left the room to go in\r\nsearch of Rachel and demand an explanation of her words; but Mr.\r\nHargrave followed me into the anteroom, and before I could open its\r\nouter door, gently laid his hand upon the lock. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I tell you\r\nsomething, Mrs. Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a subdued tone, with serious,\r\ndowncast eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be anything worth hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, struggling to be\r\ncomposed, for I trembled in every limb.\r\n\r\nHe quietly pushed a chair towards me. I merely leant my hand upon it,\r\nand bid him go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d said he: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I wish to say is nothing in itself;\r\nand I will leave you to draw your own inferences from it. You say that\r\nAnnabella is not yet returned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94go on!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, impatiently; for I feared my forced calmness\r\nwould leave me before the end of his disclosure, whatever it might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you hear,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Huntingdon is gone out with\r\nGrimsby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard the latter say to your husband\xe2\x80\x94or the man who calls himself\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed submissively, and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI heard him say,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I shall manage\r\nit, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see! They\xe2\x80\x99re gone down by the water; I shall meet them\r\nthere, and tell him I want a bit of talk with him about some things\r\nthat we needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble the lady with; and she\xe2\x80\x99ll say she can be\r\nwalking back to the house; and then I shall apologise, you know, and\r\nall that, and tip her a wink to take the way of the shrubbery. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nkeep him talking there, about those matters I mentioned, and anything\r\nelse I can think of, as long as I can, and then bring him round the\r\nother way, stopping to look at the trees, the fields, and anything else\r\nI can find to discourse of.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Hargrave paused, and looked at me.\r\n\r\nWithout a word of comment or further questioning, I rose, and darted\r\nfrom the room and out of the house. The torment of suspense was not to\r\nbe endured: I would not suspect my husband falsely, on this man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccusation, and I would not trust him unworthily\xe2\x80\x94I must know the truth\r\nat once. I flew to the shrubbery. Scarcely had I reached it, when a\r\nsound of voices arrested my breathless speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have lingered too long; he will be back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely not, dearest!\xe2\x80\x9d was _his_ reply; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you can run across the\r\nlawn, and get in as quietly as you can; I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow in a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy knees trembled under me; my brain swam round. I was ready to faint.\r\nShe must not see me thus. I shrunk among the bushes, and leant against\r\nthe trunk of a tree to let her pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Huntingdon!\xe2\x80\x9d said she reproachfully, pausing where I had stood\r\nwith him the night before\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit was here you kissed that woman!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nlooked back into the leafy shade. Advancing thence, he answered, with a\r\ncareless laugh,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dearest, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. You know I must keep straight with\r\nher as long as I can. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I seen you kiss your dolt of a husband\r\nscores of times?\xe2\x80\x94and do _I_ ever complain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you love her still\xe2\x80\x94a _little?_\xe2\x80\x9d said she, placing\r\nher hand on his arm, looking earnestly in his face\xe2\x80\x94for I could see\r\nthem, plainly, the moon shining full upon them from between the\r\nbranches of the tree that sheltered me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _one bit_, by all that\xe2\x80\x99s sacred!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, kissing her glowing\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, I _must_ be gone!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, suddenly breaking from\r\nhim, and away she flew.\r\n\r\nThere he stood before me; but I had not strength to confront him now:\r\nmy tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth; I was well-nigh sinking to\r\nthe earth, and I almost wondered he did not hear the beating of my\r\nheart above the low sighing of the wind and the fitful rustle of the\r\nfalling leaves. My senses seemed to fail me, but still I saw his\r\nshadowy form pass before me, and through the rushing sound in my ears I\r\ndistinctly heard him say, as he stood looking up the lawn,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThere goes\r\nthe fool! Run, Annabella, run! There\xe2\x80\x94in with you! Ah,\xe2\x80\x94he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see!\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, Grimsby, keep him back!\xe2\x80\x9d And even his low laugh reached\r\nme as he walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help me now!\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured, sinking on my knees among the damp weeds\r\nand brushwood that surrounded me, and looking up at the moonlit sky,\r\nthrough the scant foliage above. It seemed all dim and quivering now to\r\nmy darkened sight. My burning, bursting heart strove to pour forth its\r\nagony to God, but could not frame its anguish into prayer; until a gust\r\nof wind swept over me, which, while it scattered the dead leaves, like\r\nblighted hopes, around, cooled my forehead, and seemed a little to\r\nrevive my sinking frame. Then, while I lifted up my soul in speechless,\r\nearnest supplication, some heavenly influence seemed to strengthen me\r\nwithin: I breathed more freely; my vision cleared; I saw distinctly the\r\npure moon shining on, and the light clouds skimming the clear, dark\r\nsky; and then I saw the eternal stars twinkling down upon me; I knew\r\ntheir God was mine, and He was strong to save and swift to hear. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill never leave thee, nor forsake thee,\xe2\x80\x9d seemed whispered from above\r\ntheir myriad orbs. No, no; I felt He would not leave me comfortless: in\r\nspite of earth and hell I should have strength for all my trials, and\r\nwin a glorious rest at last!\r\n\r\nRefreshed, invigorated, if not composed, I rose and returned to the\r\nhouse. Much of my new-born strength and courage forsook me, I confess,\r\nas I entered it, and shut out the fresh wind and the glorious sky:\r\neverything I saw and heard seemed to sicken my heart\xe2\x80\x94the hall, the\r\nlamp, the staircase, the doors of the different apartments, the social\r\nsound of talk and laughter from the drawing-room. How could I bear my\r\nfuture life! In this house, among those people\xe2\x80\x94oh, how could I endure\r\nto live! John just then entered the hall, and seeing me, told me he had\r\nbeen sent in search of me, adding that he had taken in the tea, and\r\nmaster wished to know if I were coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Mrs. Hattersley to be so kind as to make the tea, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay I am not well to-night, and wish to be excused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI retired into the large, empty dining-room, where all was silence and\r\ndarkness, but for the soft sighing of the wind without, and the faint\r\ngleam of moonlight that pierced the blinds and curtains; and there I\r\nwalked rapidly up and down, thinking of my bitter thoughts alone. How\r\ndifferent was this from the evening of yesterday! _That_, it seems, was\r\nthe last expiring flash of my life\xe2\x80\x99s happiness. Poor, blinded fool that\r\nI was to be so happy! I could now see the reason of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s strange\r\nreception of me in the shrubbery; the burst of kindness was for his\r\nparamour, the start of horror for his wife. Now, too, I could better\r\nunderstand the conversation between Hattersley and Grimsby; it was\r\ndoubtless of his love for _her_ they spoke, not for me.\r\n\r\nI heard the drawing-room door open: a light quick step came out of the\r\nante-room, crossed the hall, and ascended the stairs. It was Milicent,\r\npoor Milicent, gone to see how I was\xe2\x80\x94no one else cared for me; but\r\n_she_ still was kind. I shed no tears before, but now they came, fast\r\nand free. Thus she did me good, without approaching me. Disappointed in\r\nher search, I heard her come down, more slowly than she had ascended.\r\nWould she come in there, and find me out? No, she turned in the\r\nopposite direction and re-entered the drawing-room. I was glad, for I\r\nknew not how to meet her, or what to say. I wanted no confidante in my\r\ndistress. I deserved none, and I wanted none. I had taken the burden\r\nupon myself; let me bear it alone.\r\n\r\nAs the usual hour of retirement approached I dried my eyes, and tried\r\nto clear my voice and calm my mind. I must see Arthur to-night, and\r\nspeak to him; but I would do it calmly: there should be no\r\nscene\xe2\x80\x94nothing to complain or to boast of to his companions\xe2\x80\x94nothing to\r\nlaugh at with his lady-love. When the company were retiring to their\r\nchambers I gently opened the door, and just as he passed, beckoned him\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to do with _you_, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you come to\r\nmake tea for us? and what the deuce are you here for, in the dark? What\r\nails you, young woman: you look like a ghost!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, surveying\r\nme by the light of his candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cto you; you have no longer any regard for me\r\nit appears; and I have no longer any for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHal-lo! what the devil is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would leave you to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued I, \xe2\x80\x9cand never again come under\r\nthis roof, but for my child\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I paused a moment to steady, my voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the devil\xe2\x80\x99s name _is_ this, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you be\r\ndriving at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know perfectly well. Let us waste no time in useless explanation,\r\nbut tell me, will you\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe vehemently swore he knew nothing about it, and insisted upon hearing\r\nwhat poisonous old woman had been blackening his name, and what\r\ninfamous lies I had been fool enough to believe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare yourself the trouble of forswearing yourself and racking your\r\nbrains to stifle truth with falsehood,\xe2\x80\x9d I coldly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\ntrusted to the testimony of no third person. I was in the shrubbery\r\nthis evening, and I saw and heard for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was enough. He uttered a suppressed exclamation of consternation\r\nand dismay, and muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cI _shall_ catch it now!\xe2\x80\x9d set down his\r\ncandle on the nearest chair, and rearing his back against the wall,\r\nstood confronting me with folded arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with the calm insolence of mingled\r\nshamelessness and desperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you let me take our child and what\r\nremains of my fortune, and go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere, where he will be safe from your contaminating influence, and\r\nI shall be delivered from your presence, and you from mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me have the child then, without the money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nor yourself without the child. Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be made\r\nthe talk of the country for your fastidious caprices?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must stay here, to be hated and despised. But henceforth we are\r\nhusband and wife only in the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am your child\xe2\x80\x99s mother, and _your_ housekeeper, nothing more. So you\r\nneed not trouble yourself any longer to feign the love you cannot feel:\r\nI will exact no more heartless caresses from you, nor offer nor endure\r\nthem either. I will not be mocked with the empty husk of conjugal\r\nendearments, when you have given the substance to another!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, if _you_ please. We shall see who will tire first, my\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I tire, it will be of living in the world with you: not of living\r\nwithout your mockery of love. When _you_ tire of your sinful ways, and\r\nshow yourself truly repentant, I will forgive you, and, perhaps, try to\r\nlove you again, though that will be hard indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! and meantime you will go and talk me over to Mrs. Hargrave, and\r\nwrite long letters to aunt Maxwell to complain of the wicked wretch you\r\nhave married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall complain to no one. Hitherto I have struggled hard to hide\r\nyour vices from every eye, and invest you with virtues you never\r\npossessed; but now you must look to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left him muttering bad language to himself, and went up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are poorly, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rachel, surveying me with deep anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too true, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, answering her sad looks rather than\r\nher words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it, or I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have mentioned such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ trouble yourself about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, kissing her pale,\r\ntime-wasted cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cI can bear it better than you imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you were always for \xe2\x80\x98bearing.\xe2\x80\x99 But if I was you I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nit; I\xe2\x80\x99d give way to it, and cry right hard! and I\xe2\x80\x99d talk too, I just\r\n_would_\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d let him know what it was to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have talked,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve said enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99d cry,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted she. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look so white and so calm,\r\nand burst my heart with keeping it in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ cried,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, smiling, in spite of my misery; \xe2\x80\x9cand I _am_\r\ncalm now, really: so don\xe2\x80\x99t discompose me again, nurse: let us say no\r\nmore about it, and _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ mention it to the servants. There, you may\r\ngo now. Good-night; and don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb your rest for me: I shall sleep\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94if I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this resolution, I found my bed so intolerable that,\r\nbefore two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I rose, and lighting my candle by the rushlight\r\nthat was still burning, I got my desk and sat down in my dressing-gown\r\nto recount the events of the past evening. It was better to be so\r\noccupied than to be lying in bed torturing my brain with recollections\r\nof the far past and anticipations of the dreadful future. I have found\r\nrelief in describing the very circumstances that have destroyed my\r\npeace, as well as the little trivial details attendant upon their\r\ndiscovery. No sleep I could have got this night would have done so much\r\ntowards composing my mind, and preparing me to meet the trials of the\r\nday. I fancy so, at least; and yet, when I cease writing, I find my\r\nhead aches terribly; and when I look into the glass, I am startled at\r\nmy haggard, worn appearance.\r\n\r\nRachel has been to dress me, and says I have had a sad night of it, she\r\ncan see. Milicent has just looked in to ask me how I was. I told her I\r\nwas better, but to excuse my appearance admitted I had had a restless\r\nnight. I wish this day were over! I shudder at the thoughts of going\r\ndown to breakfast. How shall I encounter them all? Yet let me remember\r\nit is not _I_ that am guilty: _I_ have no cause to fear; and if _they_\r\nscorn me as a victim of their guilt, I can pity their folly and despise\r\ntheir scorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEvening.\xe2\x80\x94Breakfast passed well over: I was calm and cool throughout. I\r\nanswered composedly all inquiries respecting my health; and whatever\r\nwas unusual in my look or manner was generally attributed to the\r\ntrifling indisposition that had occasioned my early retirement last\r\nnight. But how am I to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet\r\nelapse before they go? Yet why so long for their departure? When they\r\n_are_ gone, how shall I get through the months or years of my future\r\nlife in company with that man\xe2\x80\x94my greatest enemy? for none could injure\r\nme as he has done. Oh! when I think how fondly, how foolishly I have\r\nloved him, how madly I have trusted him, how constantly I have\r\nlaboured, and studied, and prayed, and struggled for his advantage; and\r\nhow cruelly he has trampled on my love, betrayed my trust, scorned my\r\nprayers and tears, and efforts for his preservation, crushed my hopes,\r\ndestroyed my youth\xe2\x80\x99s best feelings, and doomed me to a life of hopeless\r\nmisery, as far as man can do it, it is not enough to say that I no\r\nlonger love my husband\xe2\x80\x94I HATE him! The word stares me in the face like\r\na guilty confession, but it is true: I hate him\xe2\x80\x94I hate him! But God\r\nhave mercy on his miserable soul! and make him see and feel his guilt\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nask no other vengeance! If he could but fully know and truly feel my\r\nwrongs I should be well avenged, and I could freely pardon all; but he\r\nis so lost, so hardened in his heartless depravity, that in this life I\r\nbelieve he never will. But it is useless dwelling on this theme: let me\r\nseek once more to dissipate reflection in the minor details of passing\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nMr. Hargrave has annoyed me all day long with his serious,\r\nsympathising, and (as _he_ thinks) unobtrusive politeness. If it were\r\nmore obtrusive it would trouble me less, for then I could snub him;\r\nbut, as it is, he contrives to appear so really kind and thoughtful\r\nthat I cannot do so without rudeness and seeming ingratitude. I\r\nsometimes think I ought to give him credit for the good feeling he\r\nsimulates so well; and then again, I think it is my _duty_ to suspect\r\nhim under the peculiar circumstances in which I am placed. His kindness\r\nmay not all be feigned; but still, let not the purest impulse of\r\ngratitude to him induce me to forget myself: let me remember the game\r\nof chess, the expressions he used on the occasion, and those\r\nindescribable looks of his, that so justly roused my indignation, and I\r\nthink I shall be safe enough. I have done well to record them so\r\nminutely.\r\n\r\nI think he wishes to find an opportunity of speaking to me alone: he\r\nhas seemed to be on the watch all day; but I have taken care to\r\ndisappoint him\xe2\x80\x94not that I fear anything he could say, but I have\r\ntrouble enough without the addition of his insulting consolations,\r\ncondolences, or whatever else he might attempt; and, for Milicent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, I do not wish to quarrel with him. He excused himself from going\r\nout to shoot with the other gentlemen in the morning, under the pretext\r\nof having letters to write; and instead of retiring for that purpose\r\ninto the library, he sent for his desk into the morning-room, where I\r\nwas seated with Milicent and Lady Lowborough. They had betaken\r\nthemselves to their work; I, less to divert my mind than to deprecate\r\nconversation, had provided myself with a book. Milicent saw that I\r\nwished to be quiet, and accordingly let me alone. Annabella, doubtless,\r\nsaw it too: but that was no reason why she should restrain her tongue,\r\nor curb her cheerful spirits: _she_ accordingly chatted away,\r\naddressing herself almost exclusively to me, and with the utmost\r\nassurance and familiarity, growing the more animated and friendly the\r\ncolder and briefer my answers became. Mr. Hargrave saw that I could ill\r\nendure it, and, looking up from his desk, he answered her questions and\r\nobservations for me, as far as he could, and attempted to transfer her\r\nsocial attentions from me to himself; but it would not do. Perhaps she\r\nthought I had a headache, and could not bear to talk; at any rate, she\r\nsaw that her loquacious vivacity annoyed me, as I could tell by the\r\nmalicious pertinacity with which she persisted. But I checked it\r\neffectually by putting into her hand the book I had been trying to\r\nread, on the fly-leaf of which I had hastily scribbled,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any\r\nreal friendship for you, and as I am without your talent for\r\ndissimulation, I cannot assume the appearance of it. I must, therefore,\r\nbeg that hereafter all familiar intercourse may cease between us; and\r\nif I still continue to treat you with civility, as if you were a woman\r\nworthy of consideration and respect, understand that it is out of\r\nregard for your cousin Milicent\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, not for yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon perusing this she turned scarlet, and bit her lip. Covertly\r\ntearing away the leaf, she crumpled it up and put it in the fire, and\r\nthen employed herself in turning over the pages of the book, and,\r\nreally or apparently, perusing its contents. In a little while Milicent\r\nannounced it her intention to repair to the nursery, and asked if I\r\nwould accompany her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnnabella will excuse us,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s busy reading.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Annabella, suddenly looking up, and throwing her\r\nbook on the table; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to Helen a minute. You may go,\r\nMilicent, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll follow in a while.\xe2\x80\x9d (Milicent went.) \xe2\x80\x9cWill you\r\noblige me, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d continued she.\r\n\r\nHer impudence astounded me; but I complied, and followed her into the\r\nlibrary. She closed the door, and walked up to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you this?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one: I am not incapable of seeing for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are suspicious!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, smiling, with a gleam of hope.\r\nHitherto there had been a kind of desperation in her hardihood; now she\r\nwas evidently relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I _were_ suspicious,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have discovered your\r\ninfamy long before. No, Lady Lowborough, I do not found my charge upon\r\nsuspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what _do_ you found it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, throwing herself into an\r\narm-chair, and stretching out her feet to the fender, with an obvious\r\neffort to appear composed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI enjoy a moonlight ramble as well as you,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, steadily\r\nfixing my eyes upon her; \xe2\x80\x9cand the shrubbery happens to be one of my\r\nfavourite resorts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe coloured again excessively, and remained silent, pressing her\r\nfinger against her teeth, and gazing into the fire. I watched her a few\r\nmoments with a feeling of malevolent gratification; then, moving\r\ntowards the door, I calmly asked if she had anything more to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she eagerly, starting up from her reclining posture.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know if you will tell Lord Lowborough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you are disposed to publish the matter, _I_ cannot dissuade\r\nyou, of course\xe2\x80\x94but there will be terrible work if you do\xe2\x80\x94and if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, I shall think you the most generous of mortal beings\xe2\x80\x94and if\r\nthere is anything in the world I can do for you\xe2\x80\x94anything short of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShort of renouncing your guilty connection with my husband, I suppose\r\nyou mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nShe paused, in evident disconcertion and perplexity, mingled with anger\r\nshe dared not show.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot renounce what is dearer than life,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, in a low,\r\nhurried tone. Then, suddenly raising her head and fixing her gleaming\r\neyes upon me, she continued earnestly: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Helen\xe2\x80\x94or Mrs. Huntingdon,\r\nor whatever you would have me call you\xe2\x80\x94_will_ you tell him? If you are\r\ngenerous, here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your\r\nmagnanimity: if you are proud, here am I\xe2\x80\x94your rival\xe2\x80\x94ready to\r\nacknowledge myself your debtor for an act of the most noble\r\nforbearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, delightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAccept my sincere thanks,\r\nthen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sprang up, and offered me her hand. I drew back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me no thanks; it is not for _your_ sake that I refrain. Neither\r\nis it an act of any forbearance: I have no wish to publish your shame.\r\nI should be sorry to distress your husband with the knowledge of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Milicent? will you tell her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: on the contrary, I shall do my utmost to conceal it from her. I\r\nwould not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her\r\nrelation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou use hard words, Mrs. Huntingdon, but I can pardon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Lady Lowborough,\xe2\x80\x9d continued I, \xe2\x80\x9clet me counsel you to leave\r\nthis house as soon as _possible_. You must be aware that your\r\ncontinuance here is excessively disagreeable to me\xe2\x80\x94not for Mr.\r\nHuntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, observing the dawn of a malicious smile of\r\ntriumph on her face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou are welcome to him, if you like him, as far as\r\n_I_ am concerned\xe2\x80\x94but because it is painful to be always disguising my\r\ntrue sentiments respecting you, and straining to keep up an appearance\r\nof civility and respect towards one for whom I have not the most\r\ndistant shadow of esteem; and because, if you stay, your conduct cannot\r\npossibly remain concealed much longer from the only two persons in the\r\nhouse who do not know it already. And, for your husband\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nAnnabella, and even for your own, I wish\xe2\x80\x94I earnestly advise and\r\n_entreat_ you to break off this unlawful connection at once, and return\r\nto your duty while you may, before the dreadful consequences\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, interrupting me with a gesture of\r\nimpatience. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot go, Helen, before the time appointed for our\r\ndeparture. What possible pretext could I frame for such a thing?\r\nWhether I proposed going back alone\xe2\x80\x94which Lowborough would not hear\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94or taking him with me, the very circumstance itself would be certain\r\nto excite suspicion\xe2\x80\x94and when our visit is so _nearly_ at an end\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94little more than a week\xe2\x80\x94surely you can endure my presence _so_\r\nlong! I will not annoy you with any more of my friendly impertinences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have nothing more to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you mentioned this affair to Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she, as I was\r\nleaving the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you mention his name to me!\xe2\x80\x9d was the only answer I gave.\r\n\r\nNo words have passed between us since, but such as outward decency or\r\npure necessity demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nNineteenth.\xe2\x80\x94In proportion as Lady Lowborough finds she has nothing to\r\nfear from me, and as the time of departure draws nigh, the more\r\naudacious and insolent she becomes. She does not scruple to speak to my\r\nhusband with affectionate familiarity in my presence, when no one else\r\nis by, and is particularly fond of displaying her interest in his\r\nhealth and welfare, or in anything that concerns him, as if for the\r\npurpose of contrasting her kind solicitude with my cold indifference.\r\nAnd he rewards her by such smiles and glances, such whispered words, or\r\nboldly-spoken insinuations, indicative of his sense of her goodness and\r\nmy neglect, as make the blood rush into my face, in spite of myself\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nI would be utterly regardless of it all\xe2\x80\x94deaf and blind to everything\r\nthat passes between them, since the more I show myself sensible of\r\ntheir wickedness the more she triumphs in her victory, and the more he\r\nflatters himself that I love him devotedly still, in spite of my\r\npretended indifference. On such occasions I have sometimes been\r\nstartled by a subtle, fiendish suggestion inciting me to show him the\r\ncontrary by a seeming encouragement of Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s advances; but such\r\nideas are banished in a moment with horror and self-abasement; and then\r\nI hate him tenfold more than ever for having brought me to this!\xe2\x80\x94God\r\npardon me for it and all my sinful thoughts! Instead of being humbled\r\nand purified by my afflictions, I feel that they are turning my nature\r\ninto gall. This must be my fault as much as theirs that wrong me. No\r\ntrue Christian could cherish such bitter feelings as I do against him\r\nand her, especially the latter: him, I still feel that I could\r\npardon\xe2\x80\x94freely, gladly\xe2\x80\x94on the slightest token of repentance; but\r\n_she_\xe2\x80\x94words cannot utter my abhorrence. Reason forbids, but passion\r\nurges strongly; and I must pray and struggle long ere I subdue it.\r\n\r\nIt is well that she is leaving to-morrow, for I could not well endure\r\nher presence for another day. This morning she rose earlier than usual.\r\nI found her in the room alone, when I went down to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Helen! is it you?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning as I entered.\r\n\r\nI gave an involuntary start back on seeing her, at which she uttered a\r\nshort laugh, observing, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we are _both_ disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI came forward and busied myself with the breakfast things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last day I shall burden your hospitality,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as\r\nshe seated herself at the table. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, here comes one that will not\r\nrejoice at it!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, half to herself, as Arthur entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with her and wished her good-morning: then, looking\r\nlovingly in her face, and still retaining her hand in his, murmured\r\npathetically, \xe2\x80\x9cThe last\xe2\x80\x94last day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she with some asperity; \xe2\x80\x9cand I rose early to make the best\r\nof it\xe2\x80\x94I have been here alone this half-hour, and _you_\xe2\x80\x94you lazy\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I thought I was early too,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\xe2\x80\x9d dropping his voice\r\nalmost to a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see we are not alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never are,\xe2\x80\x9d returned she. But they were almost as good as alone,\r\nfor I was now standing at the window, watching the clouds, and\r\nstruggling to suppress my wrath.\r\n\r\nSome more words passed between them, which, happily, I did not\r\noverhear; but Annabella had the audacity to come and place herself\r\nbeside me, and even to put her hand upon my shoulder and say softly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not grudge him to me, Helen, for I love him more than ever\r\nyou could do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis put me beside myself. I took her hand and violently dashed it from\r\nme, with an expression of abhorrence and indignation that could not be\r\nsuppressed. Startled, almost appalled, by this sudden outbreak, she\r\nrecoiled in silence. I would have given way to my fury and said more,\r\nbut Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s low laugh recalled me to myself. I checked the\r\nhalf-uttered invective, and scornfully turned away, regretting that I\r\nhad given him so much amusement. He was still laughing when Mr.\r\nHargrave made his appearance. How much of the scene he had witnessed I\r\ndo not know, for the door was ajar when he entered. He greeted his host\r\nand his cousin both coldly, and me with a glance intended to express\r\nthe deepest sympathy mingled with high admiration and esteem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much allegiance do you owe to that man?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked below his\r\nbreath, as he stood beside me at the window, affecting to be making\r\nobservations on the weather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. And immediately returning to the table, I employed\r\nmyself in making the tea. He followed, and would have entered into some\r\nkind of conversation with me, but the other guests were now beginning\r\nto assemble, and I took no more notice of him, except to give him his\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, determined to pass as little of the day as possible in\r\ncompany with Lady Lowborough, I quietly stole away from the company and\r\nretired to the library. Mr. Hargrave followed me thither, under\r\npretence of coming for a book; and first, turning to the shelves, he\r\nselected a volume, and then quietly, but by no means timidly,\r\napproaching me, he stood beside me, resting his hand on the back of my\r\nchair, and said softly, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you consider yourself free at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, without moving, or raising my eyes from my book, \xe2\x80\x9cfree\r\nto do anything but offend God and my conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided your conscience be not too morbidly\r\ntender, and your ideas of God not too erroneously severe; but can you\r\nsuppose it would offend that benevolent Being to make the happiness of\r\none who would die for yours?\xe2\x80\x94to raise a devoted heart from purgatorial\r\ntorments to a state of heavenly bliss, when you could do it without the\r\nslightest injury to yourself or any other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was spoken in a low, earnest, melting tone, as he bent over me. I\r\nnow raised my head; and steadily confronting his gaze, I answered\r\ncalmly, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hargrave, do you mean to insult me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not prepared for this. He paused a moment to recover the shock;\r\nthen, drawing himself up and removing his hand from my chair, he\r\nanswered, with proud sadness,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not my intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI just glanced towards the door, with a slight movement of the head,\r\nand then returned to my book. He immediately withdrew. This was better\r\nthan if I had answered with more words, and in the passionate spirit to\r\nwhich my first impulse would have prompted. What a good thing it is to\r\nbe able to command one\xe2\x80\x99s temper! I must labour to cultivate this\r\ninestimable quality: God only knows how often I shall need it in this\r\nrough, dark road that lies before me.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the morning I drove over to the Grove with the two\r\nladies, to give Milicent an opportunity for bidding farewell to her\r\nmother and sister. They persuaded her to stay with them the rest of the\r\nday, Mrs. Hargrave promising to bring her back in the evening and\r\nremain till the party broke up on the morrow. Consequently, Lady\r\nLowborough and I had the pleasure of returning _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ in the\r\ncarriage together. For the first mile or two we kept silence, I looking\r\nout of my window, and she leaning back in her corner. But I was not\r\ngoing to restrict myself to any particular position for her; when I was\r\ntired of leaning forward, with the cold, raw wind in my face, and\r\nsurveying the russet hedges and the damp, tangled grass of their banks,\r\nI gave it up and leant back too. With her usual impudence, my companion\r\nthen made some attempts to get up a conversation; but the monosyllables\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chumph,\xe2\x80\x9d were the utmost her several remarks could\r\nelicit from me. At last, on her asking my opinion upon some immaterial\r\npoint of discussion, I answered,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you wish to talk to me, Lady Lowborough? You must know what I\r\nthink of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you _will_ be so bitter against me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it; but _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ not going to sulk for anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d Our short drive was\r\nnow at an end. As soon as the carriage door was opened, she sprang out,\r\nand went down the park to meet the gentlemen, who were just returning\r\nfrom the woods. Of course I did not follow.\r\n\r\nBut I had not done with her impudence yet: after dinner, I retired to\r\nthe drawing-room, as usual, and she accompanied me, but I had the two\r\nchildren with me, and I gave them my whole attention, and determined to\r\nkeep them till the gentlemen came, or till Milicent arrived with her\r\nmother. Little Helen, however, was soon tired of playing, and insisted\r\nupon going to sleep; and while I sat on the sofa with her on my knee,\r\nand Arthur seated beside me, gently playing with her soft, flaxen hair,\r\nLady Lowborough composedly came and placed herself on the other side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be delivered from my\r\npresence, which, no doubt, you will be very glad of\xe2\x80\x94it is natural you\r\nshould; but do you know I have rendered you a great service? Shall I\r\ntell you what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad to hear of any service you have rendered me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I,\r\ndetermined to be calm, for I knew by the tone of her voice she wanted\r\nto provoke me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed she, \xe2\x80\x9chave you not observed the salutary change in Mr.\r\nHuntingdon? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what a sober, temperate man he is become? You\r\nsaw with regret the sad habits he was contracting, I know: and I know\r\nyou did your utmost to deliver him from them, but without success,\r\nuntil I came to your assistance. I told him in few words that I could\r\nnot bear to see him degrade himself so, and that I should cease to\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nmatter what I told him, but you see the reformation I have wrought; and\r\nyou ought to thank me for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose and rang for the nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I desire no thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued; \xe2\x80\x9call the return I ask is, that\r\nyou will take care of him when I am gone, and not, by harshness and\r\nneglect, drive him back to his old courses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was almost sick with passion, but Rachel was now at the door. I\r\npointed to the children, for I could not trust myself to speak: she\r\ntook them away, and I followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the speaker.\r\n\r\nI gave her a look that blighted the malicious smile on her face, or\r\nchecked it, at least for a moment, and departed. In the ante-room I met\r\nMr. Hargrave. He saw I was in no humour to be spoken to, and suffered\r\nme to pass without a word; but when, after a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 seclusion in\r\nthe library, I had regained my composure, and was returning to join\r\nMrs. Hargrave and Milicent, whom I had just heard come downstairs and\r\ngo into the drawing-room, I found him there still lingering in the\r\ndimly-lighted apartment, and evidently waiting for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he as I passed, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you allow me one word?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it then? be quick, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offended you this morning; and I cannot live under your\r\ndispleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go, and sin no more,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, hastily, setting himself before me. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, but\r\nI must have your forgiveness. I leave you to-morrow, and I may not have\r\nan opportunity of speaking to you again. I was wrong to forget myself\r\nand you, as I did; but let me implore you to forget and forgive my rash\r\npresumption, and think of me as if those words had never been spoken;\r\nfor, believe me, I regret them deeply, and the loss of your esteem is\r\ntoo severe a penalty: I cannot bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgetfulness is not to be purchased with a wish; and I cannot bestow\r\nmy esteem on all who desire it, unless they deserve it too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall think my life well spent in labouring to deserve it, if you\r\nwill but pardon this offence\xe2\x80\x94will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! but that is coldly spoken. Give me your hand and I\xe2\x80\x99ll believe\r\nyou. You won\xe2\x80\x99t? Then, Mrs. Huntingdon, you do _not_ forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; here it is, and my forgiveness with it: only, _sin no more_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed my cold hand with sentimental fervour, but said nothing, and\r\nstood aside to let me pass into the room, where all the company were\r\nnow assembled. Mr. Grimsby was seated near the door: on seeing me\r\nenter, almost immediately followed by Hargrave, he leered at me with a\r\nglance of intolerable significance, as I passed. I looked him in the\r\nface, till he sullenly turned away, if not _ashamed_, at least\r\n_confounded_ for the moment. Meantime Hattersley had seized Hargrave by\r\nthe arm, and was whispering something in his ear\xe2\x80\x94some coarse joke, no\r\ndoubt, for the latter neither laughed nor spoke in answer, but, turning\r\nfrom him with a slight curl of the lip, disengaged himself and went to\r\nhis mother, who was telling Lord Lowborough how many reasons she had to\r\nbe proud of her son.\r\n\r\nThank heaven, they are all going to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 20th, 1824.\xe2\x80\x94This is the third anniversary of our felicitous\r\nunion. It is now two months since our guests left us to the enjoyment\r\nof each other\xe2\x80\x99s society; and I have had nine weeks\xe2\x80\x99 experience of this\r\nnew phase of conjugal life\xe2\x80\x94two persons living together, as master and\r\nmistress of the house, and father and mother of a winsome, merry little\r\nchild, with the mutual understanding that there is no love, friendship,\r\nor sympathy between them. As far as in me lies, I endeavour to live\r\npeaceably with him: I treat him with unimpeachable civility, give up my\r\nconvenience to his, wherever it may reasonably be done, and consult him\r\nin a business-like way on household affairs, deferring to his pleasure\r\nand judgment, even when I know the latter to be inferior to my own.\r\n\r\nAs for him, for the first week or two, he was peevish and low,\r\nfretting, I suppose, over his dear Annabella\xe2\x80\x99s departure, and\r\nparticularly ill-tempered to me: everything I did was wrong; I was\r\ncold-hearted, hard, insensate; my sour, pale face was perfectly\r\nrepulsive; my voice made him shudder; he knew not how he could live\r\nthrough the winter with me; I should kill him by inches. Again I\r\nproposed a separation, but it would not do: he was not going to be the\r\ntalk of all the old gossips in the neighbourhood: he would not have it\r\nsaid that he was such a brute his wife could not live with him. No; he\r\nmust contrive to bear with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must contrive to bear with _you_, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cfor so long as\r\nI discharge my functions of steward and house-keeper, so\r\nconscientiously and well, without pay and without thanks, you cannot\r\nafford to part with me. I shall therefore remit these duties when my\r\nbondage becomes intolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d This threat, I thought, would serve to\r\nkeep him in check, if anything would.\r\n\r\nI believe he was much disappointed that I did not feel his offensive\r\nsayings more acutely, for when he had said anything particularly well\r\ncalculated to hurt my feelings, he would stare me searchingly in the\r\nface, and then grumble against my \xe2\x80\x9cmarble heart\xe2\x80\x9d or my \xe2\x80\x9cbrutal\r\ninsensibility.\xe2\x80\x9d If I had bitterly wept and deplored his lost affection,\r\nhe would, perhaps, have condescended to pity me, and taken me into\r\nfavour for a while, just to comfort his solitude and console him for\r\nthe absence of his beloved Annabella, until he could meet her again, or\r\nsome more fitting substitute. Thank heaven, I am not so weak as that! I\r\nwas infatuated once with a foolish, besotted affection, that clung to\r\nhim in spite of his unworthiness, but it is fairly gone now\xe2\x80\x94wholly\r\ncrushed and withered away; and he has none but himself and his vices to\r\nthank for it.\r\n\r\nAt first (in compliance with his sweet lady\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions, I suppose),\r\nhe abstained wonderfully well from seeking to solace his cares in wine;\r\nbut at length he began to relax his virtuous efforts, and now and then\r\nexceeded a little, and still continues to do so; nay, sometimes, not a\r\nlittle. When he is under the exciting influence of these excesses, he\r\nsometimes fires up and attempts to play the brute; and then I take\r\nlittle pains to suppress my scorn and disgust. When he is under the\r\n_depressing_ influence of the after-consequences, he bemoans his\r\nsufferings and his errors, and charges them both upon me; he knows such\r\nindulgence injures his health, and does him more harm than good; but he\r\nsays I drive him to it by my unnatural, unwomanly conduct; it will be\r\nthe ruin of him in the end, but it is all my fault; and _then_ I am\r\nroused to defend myself, sometimes with bitter recrimination. This is a\r\nkind of injustice I cannot patiently endure. Have I not laboured long\r\nand hard to save him from this very vice? Would I not labour still to\r\ndeliver him from it if I could? but could I do so by fawning upon him\r\nand caressing him when I know that he scorns me? Is it _my_ fault that\r\nI have lost my influence with him, or that he has forfeited every claim\r\nto my regard? And should I seek a reconciliation with him, when I feel\r\nthat I abhor him, and that he despises me? and while he continues still\r\nto correspond with Lady Lowborough, as I know he does? No, never,\r\nnever, never! he may drink himself dead, but it is NOT my fault!\r\n\r\nYet I do my part to save him still: I give him to understand that\r\ndrinking makes his eyes dull, and his face red and bloated; and that it\r\ntends to render him imbecile in body and mind; and if Annabella were to\r\nsee him as often as I do, she would speedily be disenchanted; and that\r\nshe certainly will withdraw her favour from him, if he continues such\r\ncourses. Such a mode of admonition wins only coarse abuse for me\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nindeed, I almost feel as if I deserved it, for I hate to use such\r\narguments; but they sink into his stupefied heart, and make him pause,\r\nand ponder, and abstain, more than anything else I could say.\r\n\r\nAt present I am enjoying a temporary relief from his presence: he is\r\ngone with Hargrave to join a distant hunt, and will probably not be\r\nback before to-morrow evening. How differently I used to feel his\r\nabsence!\r\n\r\nMr. Hargrave is still at the Grove. He and Arthur frequently meet to\r\npursue their rural sports together: he often calls upon us here, and\r\nArthur not unfrequently rides over to him. I do not think either of\r\nthese soi-disant friends is overflowing with love for the other; but\r\nsuch intercourse serves to get the time on, and I am very willing it\r\nshould continue, as it saves me some hours of discomfort in Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsociety, and gives him some better employment than the sottish\r\nindulgence of his sensual appetites. The only objection I have to Mr.\r\nHargrave\xe2\x80\x99s being in the neighbourhood, is that the fear of meeting him\r\nat the Grove prevents me from seeing his sister so often as I otherwise\r\nshould; for, of late, he has conducted himself towards me with such\r\nunerring propriety, that I have almost forgotten his former conduct. I\r\nsuppose he is striving to \xe2\x80\x9cwin my esteem.\xe2\x80\x9d If he continue to act in\r\nthis way, he _may_ win it; but what then? The moment he attempts to\r\ndemand anything more, he will lose it again.\r\n\r\nFebruary 10th.\xe2\x80\x94It is a hard, embittering thing to have one\xe2\x80\x99s kind\r\nfeelings and good intentions cast back in one\xe2\x80\x99s teeth. I was beginning\r\nto relent towards my wretched partner; to pity his forlorn, comfortless\r\ncondition, unalleviated as it is by the consolations of intellectual\r\nresources and the answer of a good conscience towards God; and to think\r\nI ought to sacrifice my pride, and renew my efforts once again to make\r\nhis home agreeable and lead him back to the path of virtue; not by\r\nfalse professions of love, and not by pretended remorse, but by\r\nmitigating my habitual coldness of manner, and commuting my frigid\r\ncivility into kindness wherever an opportunity occurred; and not only\r\nwas I beginning to think so, but I had already begun to act upon the\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94and what was the result? No answering spark of kindness, no\r\nawakening penitence, but an unappeasable ill-humour, and a spirit of\r\ntyrannous exaction that increased with indulgence, and a lurking gleam\r\nof self-complacent triumph at every detection of relenting softness in\r\nmy manner, that congealed me to marble again as often as it recurred;\r\nand this morning he finished the business:\xe2\x80\x94I think the petrifaction is\r\nso completely effected at last that nothing can melt me again. Among\r\nhis letters was one which he perused with symptoms of unusual\r\ngratification, and then threw it across the table to me, with the\r\nadmonition,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! read that, and take a lesson by it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in the free, dashing hand of Lady Lowborough. I glanced at the\r\nfirst page; it seemed full of extravagant protestations of affection;\r\nimpetuous longings for a speedy reunion\xe2\x80\x94and impious defiance of God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmandates, and railings against His providence for having cast their lot\r\nasunder, and doomed them both to the hateful bondage of alliance with\r\nthose they could not love. He gave a slight titter on seeing me change\r\ncolour. I folded up the letter, rose, and returned it to him, with no\r\nremark, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, I _will_ take a lesson by it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy little Arthur was standing between his knees, delightedly playing\r\nwith the bright, ruby ring on his finger. Urged by a sudden, imperative\r\nimpulse to deliver my son from that contaminating influence, I caught\r\nhim up in my arms and carried him with me out of the room. Not liking\r\nthis abrupt removal, the child began to pout and cry. This was a new\r\nstab to my already tortured heart. I would not let him go; but, taking\r\nhim with me into the library, I shut the door, and, kneeling on the\r\nfloor beside him, I embraced him, kissed him, wept over with him with\r\npassionate fondness. Rather frightened than consoled by this, he turned\r\nstruggling from me, and cried out aloud for his papa. I released him\r\nfrom my arms, and never were more bitter tears than those that now\r\nconcealed him from my blinded, burning eyes. Hearing his cries, the\r\nfather came to the room. I instantly turned away, lest he should see\r\nand misconstrue my emotion. He swore at me, and took the now pacified\r\nchild away.\r\n\r\nIt is hard that my little darling should love him more than me; and\r\nthat, when the well-being and culture of my son is all I have to live\r\nfor, I should see my influence destroyed by one whose selfish affection\r\nis more injurious than the coldest indifference or the harshest tyranny\r\ncould be. If I, for his good, deny him some trifling indulgence, he\r\ngoes to his father, and the latter, in spite of his selfish indolence,\r\nwill even give himself some trouble to meet the child\xe2\x80\x99s desires: if I\r\nattempt to curb his will, or look gravely on him for some act of\r\nchildish disobedience, he knows his other parent will smile and take\r\nhis part against me. Thus, not only have I the father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit in the\r\nson to contend against, the germs of his evil tendencies to search out\r\nand eradicate, and his corrupting intercourse and example in after-life\r\nto counteract, but already _he_ counteracts my arduous labour for the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s advantage, destroys my influence over his tender mind, and robs\r\nme of his very love; I had no earthly hope but this, and he seems to\r\ntake a diabolical delight in tearing it away.\r\n\r\nBut it is wrong to despair; I will remember the counsel of the inspired\r\nwriter to him \xe2\x80\x9cthat feareth the Lord and obeyeth the voice of his\r\nservant, that _sitteth in darkness and hath no light;_ let him trust in\r\nthe name of the Lord, and stay upon his God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 20th, 1825.\xe2\x80\x94Another year is past; and I am weary of this life.\r\nAnd yet I cannot wish to leave it: whatever afflictions assail me here,\r\nI cannot wish to go and leave my darling in this dark and wicked world\r\nalone, without a friend to guide him through its weary mazes, to warn\r\nhim of its thousand snares, and guard him from the perils that beset\r\nhim on every hand. I am not well fitted to be his only companion, I\r\nknow; but there is no other to supply my place. I am too grave to\r\nminister to his amusements and enter into his infantile sports as a\r\nnurse or a mother ought to do, and often his bursts of gleeful\r\nmerriment trouble and alarm me; I see in them his father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit and\r\ntemperament, and I tremble for the consequences; and too often damp the\r\ninnocent mirth I ought to share. That father, on the contrary, has no\r\nweight of sadness on his mind; is troubled with no fears, no scruples\r\nconcerning his son\xe2\x80\x99s future welfare; and at evenings especially, the\r\ntimes when the child sees him the most and the oftenest, he is always\r\nparticularly jocund and open-hearted: ready to laugh and to jest with\r\nanything or anybody but me, and I am particularly silent and sad:\r\ntherefore, of course, the child dotes upon his seemingly joyous\r\namusing, ever-indulgent papa, and will at any time gladly exchange my\r\ncompany for his. This disturbs me greatly; not so much for the sake of\r\nmy son\xe2\x80\x99s affection (though I do prize that highly, and though I feel it\r\nis my right, and know I have done much to earn it) as for that\r\ninfluence over him which, for his own advantage, I would strive to\r\npurchase and retain, and which for very spite his father delights to\r\nrob me of, and, from motives of mere idle egotism, is pleased to win to\r\nhimself; making no use of it but to torment me and ruin the child. My\r\nonly consolation is, that he spends comparatively little of his time at\r\nhome, and, during the months he passes in London or elsewhere, I have a\r\nchance of recovering the ground I had lost, and overcoming with good\r\nthe evil he has wrought by his wilful mismanagement. But then it is a\r\nbitter trial to behold him, on his return, doing his utmost to subvert\r\nmy labours and transform my innocent, affectionate, tractable darling\r\ninto a selfish, disobedient, and mischievous boy; thereby preparing the\r\nsoil for those vices he has so successfully cultivated in his own\r\nperverted nature.\r\n\r\nHappily, there were none of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfriends\xe2\x80\x9d invited to Grassdale\r\nlast autumn: he took himself off to visit some of them instead. I wish\r\nhe would always do so, and I wish his friends were numerous and loving\r\nenough to keep him amongst them all the year round. Mr. Hargrave,\r\nconsiderably to my annoyance, did not go with him; but I think I have\r\ndone with that gentleman at last.\r\n\r\nFor seven or eight months he behaved so remarkably well, and managed so\r\nskilfully too, that I was almost completely off my guard, and was\r\nreally beginning to look upon him as a friend, and even to treat him as\r\nsuch, with certain prudent restrictions (which I deemed scarcely\r\nnecessary); when, presuming upon my unsuspecting kindness, he thought\r\nhe might venture to overstep the bounds of decent moderation and\r\npropriety that had so long restrained him. It was on a pleasant evening\r\nat the close of May: I was wandering in the park, and he, on seeing me\r\nthere as he rode past, made bold to enter and approach me, dismounting\r\nand leaving his horse at the gate. This was the first time he had\r\nventured to come within its inclosure since I had been left alone,\r\nwithout the sanction of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s or sister\xe2\x80\x99s company, or at least\r\nthe excuse of a message from them. But he managed to appear so calm and\r\neasy, so respectful and self-possessed in his friendliness, that,\r\nthough a little surprised, I was neither alarmed nor offended at the\r\nunusual liberty, and he walked with me under the ash-trees and by the\r\nwater-side, and talked, with considerable animation, good taste, and\r\nintelligence, on many subjects, before I began to think about getting\r\nrid of him. Then, after a pause, during which we both stood gazing on\r\nthe calm, blue water\xe2\x80\x94I revolving in my mind the best means of politely\r\ndismissing my companion, he, no doubt, pondering other matters equally\r\nalien to the sweet sights and sounds that alone were present to his\r\nsenses,\xe2\x80\x94he suddenly electrified me by beginning, in a peculiar tone,\r\nlow, soft, but perfectly distinct, to pour forth the most unequivocal\r\nexpressions of earnest and passionate love; pleading his cause with all\r\nthe bold yet artful eloquence he could summon to his aid. But I cut\r\nshort his appeal, and repulsed him so determinately, so decidedly, and\r\nwith such a mixture of scornful indignation, tempered with cool,\r\ndispassionate sorrow and pity for his benighted mind, that he withdrew,\r\nastonished, mortified, and discomforted; and, a few days after, I heard\r\nthat he had departed for London. He returned, however, in eight or nine\r\nweeks, and did not entirely keep aloof from me, but comported himself\r\nin so remarkable a manner that his quick-sighted sister could not fail\r\nto notice the change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done to Walter, Mrs. Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d said she one morning,\r\nwhen I had called at the Grove, and he had just left the room after\r\nexchanging a few words of the coldest civility. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been so\r\nextremely ceremonious and stately of late, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what it is\r\nall about, unless you have desperately offended him. Tell me what it\r\nis, that I may be your mediator, and make you friends again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done nothing willingly to offend him,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he is\r\noffended, he can best tell you himself what it is about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the giddy girl, springing up and putting her head\r\nout of the window: \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s only in the garden\xe2\x80\x94Walter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Esther! you will seriously displease me if you do; and I shall\r\nleave you immediately, and not come again for months\xe2\x80\x94perhaps years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you call, Esther?\xe2\x80\x9d said her brother, approaching the window from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I wanted to ask you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Esther,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, taking her hand and giving it a severe\r\nsqueeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, \xe2\x80\x9cto get me a rose for Mrs. Huntingdon.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndeparted. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, turning to me and still\r\nholding me fast by the hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite shocked at you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re just as\r\nangry, and distant, and cold as he is: and I\xe2\x80\x99m determined you shall be\r\nas good friends as ever before you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEsther, how can you be so rude!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Hargrave, who was seated\r\ngravely knitting in her easy-chair. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely, you never _will_ learn to\r\nconduct yourself like a lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mamma, you said yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But the young lady was silenced by\r\nthe uplifted finger of her mamma, accompanied with a very stern shake\r\nof the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she cross?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered she to me; but, before I could add my\r\nshare of reproof, Mr. Hargrave reappeared at the window with a\r\nbeautiful moss-rose in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Esther, I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you the rose,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, extending it\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it her yourself, you blockhead!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, recoiling with a\r\nspring from between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Huntingdon would rather receive it from you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, in a\r\nvery serious tone, but lowering his voice that his mother might not\r\nhear. His sister took the rose and gave it to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, Mrs. Huntingdon, and he hopes you and he\r\nwill come to a better understanding by-and-by. Will that do, Walter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded the saucy girl, turning to him and putting her arm round his\r\nneck, as he stood leaning upon the sill of the window\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor should I have\r\nsaid that you are sorry you were so touchy? or that you hope she will\r\npardon your offence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou silly girl! you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are talking about,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t: for I\xe2\x80\x99m quite in the dark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Esther,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Hargrave, who, if equally benighted on\r\nthe subject of our estrangement, saw at least that her daughter was\r\nbehaving very improperly, \xe2\x80\x9cI must insist upon your leaving the room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t, Mrs. Hargrave, for I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said I,\r\nand immediately made my adieux.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after Mr. Hargrave brought his sister to see me. He\r\nconducted himself, at first, with his usual cold, distant,\r\nhalf-stately, half-melancholy, altogether injured air; but Esther made\r\nno remark upon it this time: she had evidently been schooled into\r\nbetter manners. She talked to me, and laughed and romped with little\r\nArthur, her loved and loving playmate. He, somewhat to my discomfort,\r\nenticed her from the room to have a run in the hall, and thence into\r\nthe garden. I got up to stir the fire. Mr. Hargrave asked if I felt\r\ncold, and shut the door\xe2\x80\x94a very unseasonable piece of officiousness, for\r\nI had meditated following the noisy playfellows if they did not\r\nspeedily return. He then took the liberty of walking up to the fire\r\nhimself, and asking me if I were aware that Mr. Huntingdon was now at\r\nthe seat of Lord Lowborough, and likely to continue there some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered carelessly; and if my cheek glowed\r\nlike fire, it was rather at the question than the information it\r\nconveyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t object to it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, if Lord Lowborough likes his company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no love left for him, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that\xe2\x80\x94I knew you were too high-minded and pure in your own\r\nnature to continue to regard one so utterly false and polluted with any\r\nfeelings but those of indignation and scornful abhorrence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he not your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, turning my eyes from the fire to his\r\nface, with perhaps a slight touch of those feelings he assigned to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _was_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, with the same calm gravity as before; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do\r\nnot wrong me by supposing that I could continue my friendship and\r\nesteem to a man who could so infamously, so impiously forsake and\r\ninjure one so transcendently\xe2\x80\x94well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it. But tell me, do\r\nyou never think of revenge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRevenge! No\xe2\x80\x94what good would that do?\xe2\x80\x94it would make him no better, and\r\nme no happier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to talk to you, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are only half a woman\xe2\x80\x94your nature must be half human, half\r\nangelic. Such goodness overawes me; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sir, I fear you must be very much worse than you should be, if\r\nI, a mere ordinary mortal, am, by your own confession, so vastly your\r\nsuperior; and since there exists so little sympathy between us, I think\r\nwe had better each look out for some more congenial companion.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nforthwith moving to the window, I began to look out for my little son\r\nand his gay young friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, _I_ am the ordinary mortal, I maintain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Hargrave. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill not allow myself to be worse than my fellows; but _you_, Madam\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nequally maintain there is nobody like you. But are you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nin a serious tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs happy as some others, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you as happy as you desire to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one is so blest as that comes to on this side of eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he, with a deep sad sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nimmeasurably happier than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry for you, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help replying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you, _indeed?_ No, for if you were you would be glad to relieve\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I should if I could do so without injuring myself or any\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can you suppose that I should wish you to injure yourself? No: on\r\nthe contrary, it is your own happiness I long for more than mine. You\r\nare miserable now, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, looking me boldly in\r\nthe face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not complain, but I see\xe2\x80\x94and feel\xe2\x80\x94and know that you\r\nare miserable\xe2\x80\x94and must remain so as long as you keep those walls of\r\nimpenetrable ice about your still warm and palpitating heart; and I am\r\nmiserable, too. Deign to smile on me and I am happy: trust me, and you\r\nshall be happy also, for if you _are_ a woman I can make you so\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\n_will_ do it in spite of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered between his teeth; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nas for others, the question is between ourselves alone: you cannot\r\ninjure your husband, you know, and no one else has any concern in the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a son, Mr. Hargrave, and you have a mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, retiring\r\nfrom the window, whither he had followed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey need not know,\xe2\x80\x9d he began; but before anything more could be said\r\non either side, Esther and Arthur re-entered the room. The former\r\nglanced at Walter\xe2\x80\x99s flushed, excited countenance, and then at mine\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle flushed and excited too, I daresay, though from far different\r\ncauses. She must have thought we had been quarrelling desperately, and\r\nwas evidently perplexed and disturbed at the circumstance; but she was\r\ntoo polite or too much afraid of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s anger to refer to it.\r\nShe seated herself on the sofa, and putting back her bright, golden\r\nringlets, that were scattered in wild profusion over her face, she\r\nimmediately began to talk about the garden and her little playfellow,\r\nand continued to chatter away in her usual strain till her brother\r\nsummoned her to depart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have spoken too warmly, forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured on taking his\r\nleave, \xe2\x80\x9cor I shall never forgive myself.\xe2\x80\x9d Esther smiled and glanced at\r\nme: I merely bowed, and her countenance fell. She thought it a poor\r\nreturn for Walter\xe2\x80\x99s generous concession, and was disappointed in her\r\nfriend. Poor child, she little knows the world she lives in!\r\n\r\nMr. Hargrave had not an opportunity of meeting me again in private for\r\nseveral weeks after this; but when he did meet me there was less of\r\npride and more of touching melancholy in his manner than before. Oh,\r\n_how_ he annoyed me! I was obliged at last almost entirely to remit my\r\nvisits to the Grove, at the expense of deeply offending Mrs. Hargrave\r\nand seriously afflicting poor Esther, who really values my society for\r\nwant of better, and who ought not to suffer for the fault of her\r\nbrother. But that indefatigable foe was not yet vanquished: he seemed\r\nto be always on the watch. I frequently saw him riding lingeringly past\r\nthe premises, looking searchingly round him as he went\xe2\x80\x94or, if _I_ did\r\nnot, Rachel did. That sharp-sighted woman soon guessed how matters\r\nstood between us, and descrying the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s movements from her\r\nelevation at the nursery-window, she would give me a quiet intimation\r\nif she saw me preparing for a walk when she had reason to believe he\r\nwas about, or to think it likely that he would meet or overtake me in\r\nthe way I meant to traverse. I would then defer my ramble, or confine\r\nmyself for that day to the park and gardens, or, if the proposed\r\nexcursion was a matter of importance, such as a visit to the sick or\r\nafflicted, I would take Rachel with me, and then I was never molested.\r\n\r\nBut one mild, sunshiny day, early in November, I had ventured forth\r\nalone to visit the village school and a few of the poor tenants, and on\r\nmy return I was alarmed at the clatter of a horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet behind me,\r\napproaching at a rapid, steady trot. There was no stile or gap at hand\r\nby which I could escape into the fields, so I walked quietly on, saying\r\nto myself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt may not be he after all; and if it is, and if he _do_\r\nannoy me, it shall be for the last time, I am determined, if there be\r\npower in words and looks against cool impudence and mawkish\r\nsentimentality so inexhaustible as his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horse soon overtook me, and was reined up close beside me. It _was_\r\nMr. Hargrave. He greeted me with a smile intended to be soft and\r\nmelancholy, but his triumphant satisfaction at having caught me at last\r\nso shone through that it was quite a failure. After briefly answering\r\nhis salutation and inquiring after the ladies at the Grove, I turned\r\naway and walked on; but he followed and kept his horse at my side: it\r\nwas evident he intended to be my companion all the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care. If you want another rebuff, take it\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwelcome,\xe2\x80\x9d was my inward remark. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, what next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis question, though unspoken, was not long unanswered; after a few\r\npassing observations upon indifferent subjects, he began in solemn\r\ntones the following appeal to my humanity:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be four years next April since I first saw you, Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon\xe2\x80\x94_you_ may have forgotten the circumstance, but _I_ never\r\ncan. I admired you then most deeply, but I dared not love you. In the\r\nfollowing autumn I saw so much of your perfections that I could not\r\nfail to love you, though I dared not show it. For upwards of three\r\nyears I have endured a perfect martyrdom. From the anguish of\r\nsuppressed emotions, intense and fruitless longings, silent sorrow,\r\ncrushed hopes, and trampled affections, I have suffered more than I can\r\ntell, or you imagine\xe2\x80\x94and you were the cause of it, and not altogether\r\nthe innocent cause. My youth is wasting away; my prospects are\r\ndarkened; my life is a desolate blank; I have no rest day or night: I\r\nam become a burden to myself and others, and you might save me by a\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94a glance, and will not do it\xe2\x80\x94is this right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t believe _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d answered I; \xe2\x80\x9cin the\r\nsecond, if you will be such a fool, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hinder it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you affect,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cto regard as folly the best,\r\nthe strongest, the most godlike impulses of our nature, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nyou. I know you are not the heartless, icy being you pretend to be\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nhad a heart once, and gave it to your husband. When you found him\r\nutterly unworthy of the treasure, you reclaimed it; and you will not\r\n_pretend_ that you loved that sensual, earthly-minded profligate so\r\ndeeply, so devotedly, that you can never love another? I know that\r\nthere are feelings in your nature that have never yet been called\r\nforth; I know, too, that in your present neglected lonely state you are\r\nand _must_ be miserable. You have it in your power to raise two human\r\nbeings from a state of actual suffering to such unspeakable beatitude\r\nas only generous, noble, self-forgetting love can give (for you _can_\r\nlove me if you will); you may tell me that you scorn and detest me,\r\nbut, since you have set me the example of plain speaking, I will answer\r\nthat _I do not believe you!_ But you will not do it! you choose rather\r\nto leave us miserable; and you coolly tell me it is the will of God\r\nthat we should remain so. _You_ may call this religion, but _I_ call it\r\nwild fanaticism!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another life both for you and for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it be the\r\nwill of God that we should sow in tears now, it is only that we may\r\nreap in joy hereafter. It is His will that we should not injure others\r\nby the gratification of our own earthly passions; and you have a\r\nmother, and sisters, and friends who would be seriously injured by your\r\ndisgrace; and I, too, have friends, whose peace of mind shall never be\r\nsacrificed to my enjoyment, or yours either, with my consent; and if I\r\nwere alone in the world, I have still my God and my religion, and I\r\nwould sooner die than disgrace my calling and break my faith with\r\nheaven to obtain a few brief years of false and fleeting\r\nhappiness\xe2\x80\x94happiness sure to end in misery even here\xe2\x80\x94for myself or any\r\nother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere need be no disgrace, no misery or sacrifice in any quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npersisted he. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not ask you to leave your home or defy the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion.\xe2\x80\x9d But I need not repeat all his arguments. I refuted them to\r\nthe best of my power; but that power was provokingly small, at the\r\nmoment, for I was too much flurried with indignation\xe2\x80\x94and even\r\nshame\xe2\x80\x94that he should thus dare to address me, to retain sufficient\r\ncommand of thought and language to enable me adequately to contend\r\nagainst his powerful sophistries. Finding, however, that he could not\r\nbe silenced by reason, and even covertly exulted in his seeming\r\nadvantage, and ventured to deride those assertions I had not the\r\ncoolness to prove, I changed my course and tried another plan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really love me?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, seriously, pausing and looking him\r\ncalmly in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Truly?_\xe2\x80\x9d I demanded.\r\n\r\nHis countenance brightened; he thought his triumph was at hand. He\r\ncommenced a passionate protestation of the truth and fervour of his\r\nattachment, which I cut short by another question:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it not a selfish love? Have you enough disinterested affection\r\nto enable you to sacrifice your own pleasure to mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would give my life to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want your life; but have you enough real sympathy for my\r\nafflictions to induce you to make an effort to relieve them, at the\r\nrisk of a little discomfort to yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry me, and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have, _never mention this subject again_. You cannot recur to\r\nit in any way without doubling the weight of those sufferings you so\r\nfeelingly deplore. I have nothing left me but the solace of a good\r\nconscience and a hopeful trust in heaven, and you labour continually to\r\nrob me of these. If you persist, I must regard you as my deadliest\r\nfoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut hear me a moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir! You said you would give your life to serve me; I only ask\r\nyour _silence_ on one particular point. I have spoken plainly; and what\r\nI say I mean. If you torment me in this way any more, I must conclude\r\nthat your protestations are entirely false, and that you hate me in\r\nyour heart as fervently as you profess to love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bit his lip, and bent his eyes upon the ground in silence for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must leave you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at length, looking steadily upon me,\r\nas if with the last hope of detecting some token of irrepressible\r\nanguish or dismay awakened by those solemn words. \xe2\x80\x9cI must leave you. I\r\ncannot live here, and be for ever silent on the all-absorbing subject\r\nof my thoughts and wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFormerly, I believe, you spent but little of your time at home,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nanswered; \xe2\x80\x9cit will do you no harm to absent yourself again, for a\r\nwhile\xe2\x80\x94if that be really necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that be really _possible_,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered; \xe2\x80\x9cand can you bid me go so\r\ncoolly? Do you really wish it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly I do. If you cannot see me without tormenting me as you\r\nhave lately done, I would gladly say farewell and never see you more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, but, bending from his horse, held out his hand\r\ntowards me. I looked up at his face, and saw therein such a look of\r\ngenuine agony of soul, that, whether bitter disappointment, or wounded\r\npride, or lingering love, or burning wrath were uppermost, I could not\r\nhesitate to put my hand in his as frankly as if I bade a friend\r\nfarewell. He grasped it very hard, and immediately put spurs to his\r\nhorse and galloped away. Very soon after, I learned that he was gone to\r\nParis, where he still is; and the longer he stays there the better for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI thank God for this deliverance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 20th, 1826.\xe2\x80\x94The fifth anniversary of my wedding-day, and, I\r\ntrust, the last I shall spend under this roof. My resolution is formed,\r\nmy plan concocted, and already partly put in execution. My conscience\r\ndoes not blame me, but while the purpose ripens let me beguile a few of\r\nthese long winter evenings in stating the case for my own satisfaction:\r\na dreary amusement enough, but having the air of a useful occupation,\r\nand being pursued as a task, it will suit me better than a lighter one.\r\n\r\nIn September, quiet Grassdale was again alive with a party of ladies\r\nand gentlemen (so called), consisting of the same individuals as those\r\ninvited the year before last, with the addition of two or three others,\r\namong whom were Mrs. Hargrave and her younger daughter. The gentlemen\r\nand Lady Lowborough were invited for the pleasure and convenience of\r\nthe host; the other ladies, I suppose, for the sake of appearances, and\r\nto keep me in check, and make me discreet and civil in my demeanour.\r\nBut the ladies stayed only three weeks; the gentlemen, with two\r\nexceptions, above two months: for their hospitable entertainer was loth\r\nto part with them and be left alone with his bright intellect, his\r\nstainless conscience, and his loved and loving wife.\r\n\r\nOn the day of Lady Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, I followed her into her\r\nchamber, and plainly told her that, if I found reason to believe that\r\nshe still continued her criminal connection with Mr. Huntingdon, I\r\nshould think it my absolute duty to inform her husband of the\r\ncircumstance\xe2\x80\x94or awaken his suspicions at least\xe2\x80\x94however painful it might\r\nbe, or however dreadful the consequences. She was startled at first by\r\nthe declaration, so unexpected, and so determinately yet calmly\r\ndelivered; but rallying in a moment, she coolly replied that, if I saw\r\nanything at all reprehensible or suspicious in her conduct, she would\r\nfreely give me leave to tell his lordship all about it. Willing to be\r\nsatisfied with this, I left her; and certainly I saw nothing\r\nthenceforth particularly reprehensible or suspicious in her demeanour\r\ntowards her host; but then I had the other guests to attend to, and I\r\ndid not watch them narrowly\xe2\x80\x94for, to confess the truth, I _feared_ to\r\nsee anything between them. I no longer regarded it as any concern of\r\nmine, and if it was my duty to enlighten Lord Lowborough, it was a\r\npainful duty, and I dreaded to be called to perform it.\r\n\r\nBut my fears were brought to an end in a manner I had not anticipated.\r\nOne evening, about a fortnight after the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 arrival, I had\r\nretired into the library to snatch a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 respite from forced\r\ncheerfulness and wearisome discourse, for after so long a period of\r\nseclusion, dreary indeed as I had often found it, I could not always\r\nbear to be doing violence to my feelings, and goading my powers to\r\ntalk, and smile and listen, and play the attentive hostess, or even the\r\ncheerful friend: I had just ensconced myself within the bow of the\r\nwindow, and was looking out upon the west, where the darkening hills\r\nrose sharply defined against the clear amber light of evening, that\r\ngradually blended and faded away into the pure, pale blue of the upper\r\nsky, where one bright star was shining through, as if to promise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nthat dying light is gone, the world will not be left in darkness, and\r\nthey who trust in God, whose minds are unbeclouded by the mists of\r\nunbelief and sin, are never wholly comfortless,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94when I heard a hurried\r\nstep approaching, and Lord Lowborough entered. This room was still his\r\nfavourite resort. He flung the door to with unusual violence, and cast\r\nhis hat aside regardless where it fell. What could be the matter with\r\nhim? His face was ghastly pale; his eyes were fixed upon the ground;\r\nhis teeth clenched: his forehead glistened with the dews of agony. It\r\nwas plain he knew his wrongs at last!\r\n\r\nUnconscious of my presence, he began to pace the room in a state of\r\nfearful agitation, violently wringing his hands and uttering low groans\r\nor incoherent ejaculations. I made a movement to let him know that he\r\nwas not alone; but he was too preoccupied to notice it. Perhaps, while\r\nhis back was towards me, I might cross the room and slip away\r\nunobserved. I rose to make the attempt, but then he perceived me. He\r\nstarted and stood still a moment; then wiped his streaming forehead,\r\nand, advancing towards me, with a kind of unnatural composure, said in\r\na deep, almost sepulchral tone,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Huntingdon, I must leave you\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not ask the cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it then, and you can be so calm!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, surveying me with\r\nprofound astonishment, not unmingled with a kind of resentful\r\nbitterness, as it appeared to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have so long been aware of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I paused in time, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cof my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s character, that nothing shocks me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _this_\xe2\x80\x94how long have you been aware of this?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded he, laying\r\nhis clenched hand on the table beside him, and looking me keenly and\r\nfixedly in the face.\r\n\r\nI felt like a criminal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot long,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, with bitter vehemence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand you did not tell\r\nme! You helped to deceive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, I did _not_ help to deceive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you not tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I knew it would be painful to you. I hoped she would return to\r\nher duty, and then there would be no need to harrow your feelings with\r\nsuch\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God! how long has this been going on? How long has it been, Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon?\xe2\x80\x94Tell me\xe2\x80\x94I MUST know!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed, with intense and fearful\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat heaven! and she has duped me all this time!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned away with\r\na suppressed groan of agony, and paced the room again in a paroxysm of\r\nrenewed agitation. My heart smote me; but I would try to console him,\r\nthough I knew not how to attempt it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a wicked woman,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has basely deceived and betrayed\r\nyou. She is as little worthy of your regret as she was of your\r\naffection. Let her injure you no further; abstract yourself from her,\r\nand stand alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he sternly, arresting himself, and turning round\r\nupon me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have injured me too by this ungenerous concealment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden revulsion in my feelings. Something rose within me,\r\nand urged me to resent this harsh return for my heartfelt sympathy, and\r\ndefend myself with answering severity. Happily, I did not yield to the\r\nimpulse. I saw his anguish as, suddenly smiting his forehead, he turned\r\nabruptly to the window, and, looking upward at the placid sky, murmured\r\npassionately, \xe2\x80\x9cO God, that I might die!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and felt that to add one drop\r\nof bitterness to that already overflowing cup would be ungenerous\r\nindeed. And yet I fear there was more coldness than gentleness in the\r\nquiet tone of my reply:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI might offer many excuses that some would\r\nadmit to be valid, but I will not attempt to enumerate them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know them,\xe2\x80\x9d said he hastily: \xe2\x80\x9cyou would say that it was no business\r\nof yours: that I ought to have taken care of myself; that if my own\r\nblindness has led me into this pit of hell, I have no right to blame\r\nanother for giving me credit for a larger amount of sagacity than I\r\npossessed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess I was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d continued I, without regarding this bitter\r\ninterruption; \xe2\x80\x9cbut whether want of courage or mistaken kindness was the\r\ncause of my error, I think you blame me too severely. I told Lady\r\nLowborough two weeks ago, the very hour she came, that I should\r\ncertainly think it my duty to inform you if she continued to deceive\r\nyou: she gave me full liberty to do so if I should see anything\r\nreprehensible or suspicious in her conduct; I have seen nothing; and I\r\ntrusted she had altered her course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued gazing from the window while I spoke, and did not answer,\r\nbut, stung by the recollections my words awakened, stamped his foot\r\nupon the floor, ground his teeth, and corrugated his brow, like one\r\nunder the influence of acute physical pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was wrong, it was wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered at length. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing can\r\nexcuse it; nothing can atone for it,\xe2\x80\x94for nothing can recall those years\r\nof cursed credulity; nothing obliterate them!\xe2\x80\x94nothing, nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated in a whisper, whose despairing bitterness precluded all\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I put the case to myself, I own it _was_ wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nI can only now regret that I did not see it in this light before, and\r\nthat, as you say, nothing can recall the past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in my voice or in the spirit of this answer seemed to alter\r\nhis mood. Turning towards me, and attentively surveying my face by the\r\ndim light, he said, in a milder tone than he had yet employed,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou,\r\ntoo, have suffered, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suffered much, at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago; and two years hence you will be as calm as I am now,\r\nand far, far happier, I trust, for you are a man, and free to act as\r\nyou please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething like a smile, but a _very_ bitter one, crossed his face for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not been happy, lately?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a kind of effort to\r\nregain composure, and a determination to waive the further discussion\r\nof his own calamity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, almost provoked at such a question. \xe2\x80\x9cCould I be\r\nso, with such a husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have noticed a change in your appearance since the first years of\r\nyour marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued he: \xe2\x80\x9cI observed it to\xe2\x80\x94to that infernal demon,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe muttered between his teeth; \xe2\x80\x9cand he said it was your own sour temper\r\nthat was eating away your bloom: it was making you old and ugly before\r\nyour time, and had already made his fireside as comfortless as a\r\nconvent cell. You smile, Mrs. Huntingdon; nothing moves you. I wish my\r\nnature were as calm as yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy nature was not originally calm,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI have learned to appear\r\nso by dint of hard lessons and many repeated efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Mr. Hattersley burst into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Lowborough!\xe2\x80\x9d he began\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed on\r\nseeing me. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_. Cheer up, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, giving Lord Lowborough a thump on the back, which caused the\r\nlatter to recoil from him with looks of ineffable disgust and\r\nirritation. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, I want to speak with you a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it would be quite agreeable to the lady what I have\r\nto say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it would not be agreeable to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said his lordship, turning to\r\nleave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it would,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, following him into the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve the heart of a man, it would be the very ticket for you. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust this, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, rather lowering his voice, but not\r\nenough to prevent me from hearing every word he said, though the\r\nhalf-closed door stood between us. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re an ill-used man\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nnow, don\xe2\x80\x99t flare up; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to offend you: it\xe2\x80\x99s only my rough way\r\nof talking. I must speak right out, you _know_, or else not at all; and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m come\xe2\x80\x94stop now! let me explain\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m come to offer you my services,\r\nfor though Huntingdon is my friend, he\xe2\x80\x99s a devilish scamp, as we all\r\nknow, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be _your_ friend for the nonce. I know what it is you\r\nwant, to make matters straight: it\xe2\x80\x99s just to exchange a shot with him,\r\nand then you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel yourself all right again; and if an accident\r\nhappens\xe2\x80\x94why, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right too, I daresay, to a desperate fellow\r\nlike you. Come now, give me your hand, and don\xe2\x80\x99t look so black upon it.\r\nName time and place, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the more low, deliberate voice of Lord Lowborough, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\njust the remedy my own heart, or the devil within it, suggested\xe2\x80\x94to meet\r\nhim, and _not to sever without blood_. Whether I or he should fall, or\r\nboth, it would be an _inexpressible_ relief to me, if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so! Well then,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his lordship, with deep, determined emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I\r\nhate him from my heart, and should rejoice at any calamity that could\r\nbefall him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave him to God; and though I abhor my own life, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nleave that, too, to Him that gave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you see, in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Hattersley\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his companion, hastily turning away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot another word! I\xe2\x80\x99ve enough to do against the fiend within me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re a white-livered fool, and I wash my hands of you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ngrumbled the tempter, as he swung himself round and departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, right, Lord Lowborough,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, darting out and clasping his\r\nburning hand, as he was moving away to the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to think\r\nthe world is not worthy of you!\xe2\x80\x9d Not understanding this sudden\r\nebullition, he turned upon me with a stare of gloomy, bewildered\r\namazement, that made me ashamed of the impulse to which I had yielded;\r\nbut soon a more humanised expression dawned upon his countenance, and\r\nbefore I could withdraw my hand, he pressed it kindly, while a gleam of\r\ngenuine feeling flashed from his eyes as he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cGod help us\r\nboth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d responded I; and we parted.\r\n\r\nI returned to the drawing-room, where, doubtless, my presence would be\r\nexpected by most, desired by one or two. In the ante-room was Mr.\r\nHattersley, railing against Lord Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s poltroonery before a\r\nselect audience, viz. Mr. Huntingdon, who was lounging against the\r\ntable, exulting in his own treacherous villainy, and laughing his\r\nvictim to scorn, and Mr. Grimsby, standing by, quietly rubbing his\r\nhands and chuckling with fiendish satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room I found Lady Lowborough, evidently in no very\r\nenviable state of mind, and struggling hard to conceal her discomposure\r\nby an overstrained affectation of unusual cheerfulness and vivacity,\r\nvery uncalled-for under the circumstances, for she had herself given\r\nthe company to understand that her husband had received unpleasant\r\nintelligence from home, which necessitated his immediate departure, and\r\nthat he had suffered it so to bother his mind that it had brought on a\r\nbilious headache, owing to which, and the preparations he judged\r\nnecessary to hasten his departure, she believed they would not have the\r\npleasure of seeing him to-night. However, she asserted, it was only a\r\nbusiness concern, and so she did not intend it should trouble _her._\r\nShe was just saying this as I entered, and she darted upon me such a\r\nglance of hardihood and defiance as at once astonished and revolted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I _am_ troubled,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, \xe2\x80\x9cand vexed too, for I think it my\r\nduty to accompany his lordship, and of course I am very sorry to part\r\nwith all my kind friends so unexpectedly and so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, Annabella,\xe2\x80\x9d said Esther, who was sitting beside her, \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\nsaw you in better spirits in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely so, my love: because I wish to make the best of your\r\nsociety, since it appears this is to be the last night I am to enjoy it\r\ntill heaven knows when; and I wish to leave a good impression on you\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she glanced round, and seeing her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s eye fixed upon her,\r\nrather too scrutinizingly, as she probably thought, she started up and\r\ncontinued: \xe2\x80\x9cTo which end I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a song\xe2\x80\x94shall I, aunt? shall I,\r\nMrs. Huntingdon? shall I ladies and gentlemen all? Very well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nmy best to amuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe and Lord Lowborough occupied the apartments next to mine. I know\r\nnot how _she_ passed the night, but I lay awake the greater part of it\r\nlistening to his heavy step pacing monotonously up and down his\r\ndressing-room, which was nearest my chamber. Once I heard him pause and\r\nthrow something out of the window with a passionate ejaculation; and in\r\nthe morning, after they were gone, a keen-bladed clasp-knife was found\r\non the grass-plot below; a razor, likewise, was snapped in two and\r\nthrust deep into the cinders of the grate, but partially corroded by\r\nthe decaying embers. So strong had been the temptation to end his\r\nmiserable life, so determined his resolution to resist it.\r\n\r\nMy heart bled for him as I lay listening to that ceaseless tread.\r\nHitherto I had thought too much of myself, too little of him: now I\r\nforgot my own afflictions, and thought only of his; of the ardent\r\naffection so miserably wasted, the fond faith so cruelly betrayed,\r\nthe\xe2\x80\x94no, I will not attempt to enumerate his wrongs\xe2\x80\x94but I hated his wife\r\nand my husband more intensely than ever, and not for my sake, but for\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nThey departed early in the morning, before any one else was down,\r\nexcept myself, and just as I was leaving my room Lord Lowborough was\r\ndescending to take his place in the carriage, where his lady was\r\nalready ensconced; and Arthur (or Mr. Huntingdon, as I prefer calling\r\nhim, for the other is my child\xe2\x80\x99s name) had the gratuitous insolence to\r\ncome out in his dressing-gown to bid his \xe2\x80\x9cfriend\xe2\x80\x9d good-by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, going already, Lowborough!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nsmilingly offered his hand.\r\n\r\nI think the other would have knocked him down, had he not instinctively\r\nstarted back before that bony fist quivering with rage and clenched\r\ntill the knuckles gleamed white and glistening through the skin.\r\nLooking upon him with a countenance livid with furious hate, Lord\r\nLowborough muttered between his closed teeth a deadly execration he\r\nwould not have uttered had he been calm enough to choose his words, and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call that an unchristian spirit now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the villain. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever give up an old friend for the sake of a wife. You may have mine\r\nif you like, and I call that handsome; I can do no more than offer\r\nrestitution, can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Lowborough had gained the bottom of the stairs, and was now\r\ncrossing the hall; and Mr. Huntingdon, leaning over the banisters,\r\ncalled out, \xe2\x80\x9cGive my love to Annabella! and I wish you both a happy\r\njourney,\xe2\x80\x9d and withdrew, laughing, to his chamber.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently expressed himself rather glad she was gone. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was so\r\ndeuced imperious and exacting,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall be my own man\r\nagain, and feel rather more at my ease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nMy greatest source of uneasiness, in this time of trial, was my son,\r\nwhom his father and his father\xe2\x80\x99s friends delighted to encourage in all\r\nthe embryo vices a little child can show, and to instruct in all the\r\nevil habits he could acquire\xe2\x80\x94in a word, to \xe2\x80\x9cmake a man of him\xe2\x80\x9d was one\r\nof their staple amusements; and I need say no more to justify my alarm\r\non his account, and my determination to deliver him at any hazard from\r\nthe hands of such instructors. I first attempted to keep him always\r\nwith me, or in the nursery, and gave Rachel particular injunctions\r\nnever to let him come down to dessert as long as these \xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nstayed; but it was no use: these orders were immediately countermanded\r\nand overruled by his father; he was not going to have the little fellow\r\nmoped to death between an old nurse and a cursed fool of a mother. So\r\nthe little fellow came down every evening in spite of his cross mamma,\r\nand learned to tipple wine like papa, to swear like Mr. Hattersley, and\r\nto have his own way like a man, and sent mamma to the devil when she\r\ntried to prevent him. To see such things done with the roguish na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9\r\nof that pretty little child, and hear such things spoken by that small\r\ninfantile voice, was as peculiarly piquant and irresistibly droll to\r\nthem as it was inexpressibly distressing and painful to me; and when he\r\nhad set the table in a roar he would look round delightedly upon them\r\nall, and add his shrill laugh to theirs. But if that beaming blue eye\r\nrested on me, its light would vanish for a moment, and he would say, in\r\nsome concern, \xe2\x80\x9cMamma, why don\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ laugh? Make her laugh, papa\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nnever will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHence was I obliged to stay among these human brutes, watching an\r\nopportunity to get my child away from them instead of leaving them\r\nimmediately after the removal of the cloth, as I should always\r\notherwise have done. He was never willing to go, and I frequently had\r\nto carry him away by force, for which he thought me very cruel and\r\nunjust; and sometimes his father would insist upon my letting him\r\nremain; and then I would leave him to his kind friends, and retire to\r\nindulge my bitterness and despair alone, or to rack my brains for a\r\nremedy to this great evil.\r\n\r\nBut here again I must do Mr. Hargrave the justice to acknowledge that I\r\nnever saw _him_ laugh at the child\xe2\x80\x99s misdemeanours, nor heard him utter\r\na word of encouragement to his aspirations after manly accomplishments.\r\nBut when anything very extraordinary was said or done by the infant\r\nprofligate, I noticed, at times, a peculiar expression in his face that\r\nI could neither interpret nor define: a slight twitching about the\r\nmuscles of the mouth; a sudden flash in the eye, as he darted a sudden\r\nglance at the child and then at me: and then I could fancy there arose\r\na gleam of hard, keen, sombre satisfaction in his countenance at the\r\nlook of impotent wrath and anguish he was too certain to behold in\r\nmine. But on one occasion, when Arthur had been behaving particularly\r\nill, and Mr. Huntingdon and his guests had been particularly provoking\r\nand insulting to me in their encouragement of him, and I particularly\r\nanxious to get him out of the room, and on the very point of demeaning\r\nmyself by a burst of uncontrollable passion\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Hargrave suddenly rose\r\nfrom his seat with an aspect of stern determination, lifted the child\r\nfrom his father\xe2\x80\x99s knee, where he was sitting half-tipsy, cocking his\r\nhead and laughing at me, and execrating me with words he little knew\r\nthe meaning of, handed him out of the room, and, setting him down in\r\nthe hall, held the door open for me, gravely bowed as I withdrew, and\r\nclosed it after me. I heard high words exchanged between him and his\r\nalready half-inebriated host as I departed, leading away my bewildered\r\nand disconcerted boy.\r\n\r\nBut this should not continue: my child must not be abandoned to this\r\ncorruption: better far that he should live in poverty and obscurity,\r\nwith a fugitive mother, than in luxury and affluence with such a\r\nfather. These guests might not be with us long, but they would return\r\nagain: and he, the most injurious of the whole, his child\xe2\x80\x99s worst\r\nenemy, would still remain. I could endure it for myself, but for my son\r\nit must be borne no longer: the world\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and the feelings of my\r\nfriends must be alike unheeded here, at least\xe2\x80\x94alike unable to deter me\r\nfrom my duty. But where should I find an asylum, and how obtain\r\nsubsistence for us both? Oh, I would take my precious charge at early\r\ndawn, take the coach to M\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, flee to the port of \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, cross the\r\nAtlantic, and seek a quiet, humble home in New England, where I would\r\nsupport myself and him by the labour of my hands. The palette and the\r\neasel, my darling playmates once, must be my sober toil-fellows now.\r\nBut was I sufficiently skilful as an artist to obtain my livelihood in\r\na strange land, without friends and without recommendation? No; I must\r\nwait a little; I must labour hard to improve my talent, and to produce\r\nsomething worth while as a specimen of my powers, something to speak\r\nfavourably for me, whether as an actual painter or a teacher. Brilliant\r\nsuccess, of course, I did not look for, but some degree of security\r\nfrom positive failure was indispensable: I must not take my son to\r\nstarve. And then I must have money for the journey, the passage, and\r\nsome little to support us in our retreat in case I should be\r\nunsuccessful at first: and not too little either: for who could tell\r\nhow long I might have to struggle with the indifference or neglect of\r\nothers, or my own inexperience or inability to suit their tastes?\r\n\r\nWhat should I do then? Apply to my brother and explain my circumstances\r\nand my resolves to him? No, no: even if I told him _all_ my grievances,\r\nwhich I should be very reluctant to do, he would be certain to\r\ndisapprove of the step: it would seem like madness to him, as it would\r\nto my uncle and aunt, or to Milicent. No; I must have patience and\r\ngather a hoard of my own. Rachel should be my only confidante\xe2\x80\x94I thought\r\nI could persuade her into the scheme; and she should help me, first, to\r\nfind out a picture-dealer in some distant town; then, through her\r\nmeans, I would privately sell what pictures I had on hand that would do\r\nfor such a purpose, and some of those I should thereafter paint.\r\nBesides this, I would contrive to dispose of my jewels, not the family\r\njewels, but the few I brought with me from home, and those my uncle\r\ngave me on my marriage. A few months\xe2\x80\x99 arduous toil might well be borne\r\nby me with such an end in view; and in the interim my son could not be\r\nmuch more injured than he was already.\r\n\r\nHaving formed this resolution, I immediately set to work to accomplish\r\nit, I might possibly have been induced to wax cool upon it afterwards,\r\nor perhaps to keep weighing the pros and cons in my mind till the\r\nlatter overbalanced the former, and I was driven to relinquish the\r\nproject altogether, or delay the execution of it to an indefinite\r\nperiod, had not something occurred to confirm me in that determination,\r\nto which I still adhere, which I still think I did well to form, and\r\nshall do better to execute.\r\n\r\nSince Lord Lowborough\xe2\x80\x99s departure I had regarded the library as\r\nentirely my own, a secure retreat at all hours of the day. None of our\r\ngentlemen had the smallest pretensions to a literary taste, except Mr.\r\nHargrave; and he, at present, was quite contented with the newspapers\r\nand periodicals of the day. And if, by any chance, he should look in\r\nhere, I felt assured he would soon depart on seeing me, for, instead of\r\nbecoming less cool and distant towards me, he had become decidedly more\r\nso since the departure of his mother and sisters, which was just what I\r\nwished. Here, then, I set up my easel, and here I worked at my canvas\r\nfrom daylight till dusk, with very little intermission, saving when\r\npure necessity, or my duties to little Arthur, called me away: for I\r\nstill thought proper to devote some portion of every day exclusively to\r\nhis instruction and amusement. But, contrary to my expectation, on the\r\nthird morning, while I was thus employed, Mr. Hargrave _did_ look in,\r\nand did _not_ immediately withdraw on seeing me. He apologized for his\r\nintrusion, and said he was only come for a book; but when he had got\r\nit, he condescended to cast a glance over my picture. Being a man of\r\ntaste, he had something to say on this subject as well as another, and\r\nhaving modestly commented on it, without much encouragement from me, he\r\nproceeded to expatiate on the art in general. Receiving no\r\nencouragement in that either, he dropped it, but did not depart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t give us much of your company, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d observed he,\r\nafter a brief pause, during which I went on coolly mixing and tempering\r\nmy colours; \xe2\x80\x9cand I cannot wonder at it, for you must be heartily sick\r\nof us all. I myself am so thoroughly ashamed of my companions, and so\r\nweary of their irrational conversation and pursuits\xe2\x80\x94now that there is\r\nno one to humanize them and keep them in check, since you have justly\r\nabandoned us to our own devices\xe2\x80\x94that I think I shall presently withdraw\r\nfrom amongst them, probably within this week; and I cannot suppose you\r\nwill regret my departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused. I did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cyour only regret on the subject\r\nwill be that I do not take all my companions along with me. I flatter\r\nmyself, at times, that though among them I am not of them; but it is\r\nnatural that you should be glad to get rid of me. I may regret this,\r\nbut I cannot blame you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not rejoice at _your_ departure, for you _can_ conduct\r\nyourself like a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, thinking it but right to make some\r\nacknowledgment for his good behaviour; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must confess I shall\r\nrejoice to bid adieu to the rest, inhospitable as it may appear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can blame you for such an avowal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he gravely: \xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\neven the gentlemen themselves, I imagine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, as if actuated by a sudden resolution, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was said last\r\nnight in the dining-room, after you left us: perhaps you will not mind\r\nit, as you\xe2\x80\x99re so _very_ philosophical on certain points,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with\r\na slight sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were talking about Lord Lowborough and his\r\ndelectable lady, the cause of whose sudden departure is no secret\r\namongst them; and her character is so well known to them all, that,\r\nnearly related to me as she is, I could not attempt to defend it. Curse\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, _par parenth\xc3\xa9se_, \xe2\x80\x9cif I don\xe2\x80\x99t have vengeance for\r\nthis! If the villain must disgrace the family, must he blazon it abroad\r\nto every low-bred knave of his acquaintance? I beg your pardon, Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon. Well, they were talking of these things, and some of them\r\nremarked that, as she was separated from her husband, he might see her\r\nagain when he pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of her for the present: I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnot trouble to see her, unless she comes to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then what do you mean to do, Huntingdon, when we\xe2\x80\x99re gone?\xe2\x80\x99 said Ralph\r\nHattersley. \xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to turn from the error of your ways, and be a\r\ngood husband, a good father, and so forth; as I do, when I get shut of\r\nyou and all these rollicking devils you call your friends? I think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime; and your wife is fifty times too good for you, you _know_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he added some praise of you, which you would not thank me for\r\nrepeating, nor him for uttering; proclaiming it aloud, as he did,\r\nwithout delicacy or discrimination, in an audience where it seemed\r\nprofanation to utter your name: himself utterly incapable of\r\nunderstanding or appreciating your real excellences. Huntingdon,\r\nmeanwhile, sat quietly drinking his wine,\xe2\x80\x94or looking smilingly into his\r\nglass and offering no interruption or reply, till Hattersley shouted\r\nout,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Do you hear me, man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, go on,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Nay, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the other: \xe2\x80\x98I only want to know if you\r\nintend to take my advice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What advice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To turn over a new leaf, you double-dyed scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Ralph,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and beg your wife\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, and be a good boy for the future.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My wife! what wife? I have no wife,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Huntingdon, looking\r\ninnocently up from his glass, \xe2\x80\x98or if I have, look you, gentlemen: I\r\nvalue her so highly that any one among you, that can fancy her, may\r\nhave her and welcome: you may, by Jove, and my blessing into the\r\nbargain!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94hem\xe2\x80\x94someone asked if he really meant what he said; upon which he\r\nsolemnly swore he did, and no mistake. What do you think of that, Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Hargrave, after a short pause, during which I\r\nhad felt he was keenly examining my half-averted face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat what he prizes so lightly will not be\r\nlong in his possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot mean that you will break your heart and die for the\r\ndetestable conduct of an infamous villain like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means: my heart is too thoroughly dried to be broken in a hurry,\r\nand I mean to live as long as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you leave him then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen: and how?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_When_ I am ready, and _how_ I can manage it most effectually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child goes with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not allow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, it is a secret flight you meditate! but with whom, Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my son: and possibly, his nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone\xe2\x80\x94and unprotected! But where can you go? what can you do? He will\r\nfollow you and bring you back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have laid my plans too well for that. Let me once get clear of\r\nGrassdale, and I shall consider myself safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hargrave advanced one step towards me, looked me in the face, and\r\ndrew in his breath to speak; but that look, that heightened colour,\r\nthat sudden sparkle of the eye, made my blood rise in wrath: I abruptly\r\nturned away, and, snatching up my brush, began to dash away at my\r\ncanvas with rather too much energy for the good of the picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he with bitter solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are cruel\xe2\x80\x94cruel\r\nto me\xe2\x80\x94cruel to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hargrave, remember your promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _must_ speak: my heart will burst if I don\xe2\x80\x99t! I have been silent\r\nlong enough, and you _must_ hear me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, boldly intercepting my\r\nretreat to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me you owe no allegiance to your\r\nhusband; he openly declares himself weary of you, and calmly gives you\r\nup to anybody that will take you; you are about to leave him; no one\r\nwill believe that you go alone; all the world will say, \xe2\x80\x98She has left\r\nhim at last, and who can wonder at it? Few can blame her, fewer still\r\ncan pity him; but who is the companion of her flight?\xe2\x80\x99 Thus you will\r\nhave no credit for your virtue (if you call it such): even your best\r\nfriends will not believe in it; because it is monstrous, and not to be\r\ncredited but by those who suffer, from the effects of it, such cruel\r\ntorments that they know it to be indeed reality. But what can you do in\r\nthe cold, rough world alone? you, a young and inexperienced woman,\r\ndelicately nurtured, and utterly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a word, you would advise me to stay where I am,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy _all means_, leave him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he earnestly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut NOT alone! Helen!\r\nlet _me_ protect you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! while heaven spares my reason,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, snatching away the\r\nhand he had presumed to seize and press between his own. But he was in\r\nfor it now; he had fairly broken the barrier: he was completely roused,\r\nand determined to hazard all for victory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must not be denied!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he, vehemently; and seizing both my\r\nhands, he held them very tight, but dropped upon his knee, and looked\r\nup in my face with a half-imploring, half-imperious gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no\r\nreason now: you are flying in the face of heaven\xe2\x80\x99s decrees. God has\r\ndesigned me to be your comfort and protector\xe2\x80\x94I feel it, I know it as\r\ncertainly as if a voice from heaven declared, \xe2\x80\x98Ye twain shall be one\r\nflesh\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and you spurn me from you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, Mr. Hargrave!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, sternly. But he only tightened his\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, quivering with indignation.\r\n\r\nHis face was almost opposite the window as he knelt. With a slight\r\nstart, I saw him glance towards it; and then a gleam of malicious\r\ntriumph lit up his countenance. Looking over my shoulder, I beheld a\r\nshadow just retiring round the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Grimsby,\xe2\x80\x9d said he deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will report what he has\r\nseen to Huntingdon and all the rest, with such embellishments as he\r\nthinks proper. He has no love for you, Mrs. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x94no reverence for\r\nyour sex, no belief in virtue, no admiration for its image. He will\r\ngive such a version of this story as will leave no doubt at all about\r\nyour character, in the minds of those who hear it. Your fair fame is\r\ngone; and nothing that I or you can say can ever retrieve it. But give\r\nme the power to protect you, and show me the villain that dares to\r\ninsult!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has ever dared to insult me as you are doing now!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, at\r\nlength releasing my hands, and recoiling from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not insult you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he: \xe2\x80\x9cI worship you. You are my angel, my\r\ndivinity! I lay my powers at your feet, and you must and shall accept\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, impetuously starting to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ be\r\nyour consoler and defender! and if your conscience upbraid you for it,\r\nsay I overcame you, and you could not choose but yield!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never saw a man go terribly excited. He precipitated himself towards\r\nme. I snatched up my palette-knife and held it against him. This\r\nstartled him: he stood and gazed at me in astonishment; I daresay I\r\nlooked as fierce and resolute as he. I moved to the bell, and put my\r\nhand upon the cord. This tamed him still more. With a\r\nhalf-authoritative, half-deprecating wave of the hand, he sought to\r\ndeter me from ringing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand off, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said I; he stepped back. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd listen to me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike you,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, as deliberately and emphatically as I could, to\r\ngive the greater efficacy to my words; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I were divorced from my\r\nhusband, or if he were dead, I would not marry you. There now! I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face grew blanched with anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with bitter emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are the\r\nmost cold-hearted, unnatural, ungrateful woman I ever yet beheld!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Hargrave, I am not. For all the good you ever did me, or ever\r\nwished to do, I most sincerely thank you: for all the evil you have\r\ndone me, and all you would have done, I pray God to pardon you, and\r\nmake you of a better mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the door was thrown open, and Messrs. Huntingdon and Hattersley\r\nappeared without. The latter remained in the hall, busy with his ramrod\r\nand his gun; the former walked in, and stood with his back to the fire,\r\nsurveying Mr. Hargrave and me, particularly the former, with a smile of\r\ninsupportable meaning, accompanied as it was by the impudence of his\r\nbrazen brow, and the sly, malicious, twinkle of his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hargrave, interrogatively, and with the air of one\r\nprepared to stand on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned his host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to know if you are at liberty to join us in a go at the\r\npheasants, Walter,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Hattersley from without. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! there\r\nshall be nothing shot besides, except a puss or two; _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ vouch for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWalter did not answer, but walked to the window to collect his\r\nfaculties. Arthur uttered a low whistle, and followed him with his\r\neyes. A slight flush of anger rose to Hargrave\xe2\x80\x99s cheek; but in a moment\r\nhe turned calmly round, and said carelessly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came here to bid farewell to Mrs. Huntingdon, and tell her I must go\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! You\xe2\x80\x99re mighty sudden in your resolution. What takes you off so\r\nsoon, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he, repelling the other\xe2\x80\x99s incredulous sneer with a\r\nglance of scornful defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; and Hargrave walked away. Thereupon Mr.\r\nHuntingdon, gathering his coat-laps under his arms, and setting his\r\nshoulder against the mantel-piece, turned to me, and, addressing me in\r\na low voice, scarcely above his breath, poured forth a volley of the\r\nvilest and grossest abuse it was possible for the imagination to\r\nconceive or the tongue to utter. I did not attempt to interrupt him;\r\nbut my spirit kindled within me, and when he had done, I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyour accusation were true, Mr. Huntingdon, how _dare you_ blame me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s hit it, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hattersley, rearing his gun against the\r\nwall; and, stepping into the room, he took his precious friend by the\r\narm, and attempted to drag him away. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered; \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\r\nor false, _you\xe2\x80\x99ve_ no right to blame her, you _know_, nor him either;\r\nafter what you said last night. So come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something implied here that I could not endure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDare you suspect me, Mr. Hattersley?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, almost beside myself\r\nwith fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, I suspect nobody. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. So come\r\nalong, Huntingdon, you blackguard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman thus addressed, grinning in\r\nmingled rage and triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it if her life depended on\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d and muttering some more abusive language, he walked into the hall,\r\nand took up his hat and gun from the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scorn to justify myself to you!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to\r\nHattersley, \xe2\x80\x9cif you presume to have any doubts on the subject, ask Mr.\r\nHargrave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this they simultaneously burst into a rude laugh that made my whole\r\nframe tingle to the fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he? I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him myself!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, advancing towards them.\r\n\r\nSuppressing a new burst of merriment, Hattersley pointed to the outer\r\ndoor. It was half open. His brother-in-law was standing on the front\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hargrave, will you please to step this way?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked at me in grave surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStep this way, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, in so determined a manner\r\nthat he could not, or did not choose to resist its authority. Somewhat\r\nreluctantly he ascended the steps and advanced a pace or two into the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell those gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthese men, whether or not I\r\nyielded to your solicitations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, Mrs. Huntingdon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _do_ understand me, sir; and I charge you, upon your honour as a\r\ngentleman (if you have any), to answer truly. Did I, or did I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered he, turning away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak up, sir; they can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you. Did I grant your request?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sworn she didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hattersley, \xe2\x80\x9cor he\xe2\x80\x99d never look so\r\nblack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m willing to grant you the satisfaction of a gentleman, Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Hargrave, calmly addressing his host, but with a bitter sneer\r\nupon his countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter, with an impatient jerk of the\r\nhead. Hargrave withdrew with a look of cold disdain, saying,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nwhere to find me, should you feel disposed to send a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuttered oaths and curses were all the answer this intimation obtained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Huntingdon, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hattersley. \xe2\x80\x9cClear as the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care _what_ he sees,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cor what he imagines; but you,\r\nMr. Hattersley, when you hear my name belied and slandered, will you\r\ndefend it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI instantly departed and shut myself into the library. What could\r\npossess me to make such a request of such a man I cannot tell; but\r\ndrowning men catch at straws: they had driven me desperate between\r\nthem; I hardly knew what I said. There was no other to preserve my name\r\nfrom being blackened and aspersed among this nest of boon companions,\r\nand through them, perhaps, into the world; and beside my abandoned\r\nwretch of a husband, the base, malignant Grimsby, and the false villain\r\nHargrave, this boorish ruffian, coarse and brutal as he was, shone like\r\na glow-worm in the dark, among its fellow worms.\r\n\r\nWhat a scene was this! Could I ever have imagined that I should be\r\ndoomed to bear such insults under my own roof\xe2\x80\x94to hear such things\r\nspoken in my presence; nay, spoken _to_ me and _of_ me; and by those\r\nwho arrogated to themselves the name of gentlemen? And could I have\r\nimagined that I should have been able to endure it as calmly, and to\r\nrepel their insults as firmly and as boldly as I had done? A hardness\r\nsuch as this is taught by rough experience and despair alone.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts as these chased one another through my mind, as I paced\r\nto and fro the room, and longed\xe2\x80\x94oh, _how_ I longed\xe2\x80\x94to take my child and\r\nleave them now, without an hour\xe2\x80\x99s delay! But it could not be; there was\r\nwork before me: hard work, that must be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let me do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand lose not a moment in vain repinings\r\nand idle chafings against my fate, and those who influence it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd conquering my agitation with a powerful effort, I immediately\r\nresumed my task, and laboured hard all day.\r\n\r\nMr. Hargrave did depart on the morrow; and I have never seen him since.\r\nThe others stayed on for two or three weeks longer; but I kept aloof\r\nfrom them as much as possible, and still continued my labour, and have\r\ncontinued it, with almost unabated ardour, to the present day. I soon\r\nacquainted Rachel with my design, confiding all my motives and\r\nintentions to her ear, and, much to my agreeable surprise, found little\r\ndifficulty in persuading her to enter into my views. She is a sober,\r\ncautious woman, but she so hates her master, and so loves her mistress\r\nand her nursling, that after several ejaculations, a few faint\r\nobjections, and many tears and lamentations that I should be brought to\r\nsuch a pass, she applauded my resolution and consented to aid me with\r\nall her might: on one condition only: that she might share my exile:\r\notherwise, she was utterly inexorable, regarding it as perfect madness\r\nfor me and Arthur to go alone. With touching generosity, she modestly\r\noffered to aid me with her little hoard of savings, hoping I would\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexcuse her for the liberty, but really, if I would do her the favour\r\nto accept it as a loan, she would be very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course I could not\r\nthink of such a thing; but now, thank heaven, I have gathered a little\r\nhoard of my own, and my preparations are so far advanced that I am\r\nlooking forward to a speedy emancipation. Only let the stormy severity\r\nof this winter weather be somewhat abated, and then, some morning, Mr.\r\nHuntingdon will come down to a solitary breakfast-table, and perhaps be\r\nclamouring through the house for his invisible wife and child, when\r\nthey are some fifty miles on their way to the Western world, or it may\r\nbe more: for we shall leave him hours before the dawn, and it is not\r\nprobable he will discover the loss of both until the day is far\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nI am fully alive to the evils that may and must result upon the step I\r\nam about to take; but I never waver in my resolution, because I never\r\nforget my son. It was only this morning, while I pursued my usual\r\nemployment, he was sitting at my feet, quietly playing with the shreds\r\nof canvas I had thrown upon the carpet; but his mind was otherwise\r\noccupied, for, in a while, he looked up wistfully in my face, and\r\ngravely asked,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, why are you wicked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you I was wicked, love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Arthur, Rachel never said so, I am certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it was papa,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, thoughtfully. Then, after a\r\nreflective pause, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how it was I got\r\nto know: when I\xe2\x80\x99m with papa, if I say mamma wants me, or mamma says I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot to do something that he tells me to do, he always says, \xe2\x80\x98Mamma be\r\ndamned,\xe2\x80\x99 and Rachel says it\xe2\x80\x99s only wicked people that are damned. So,\r\nmamma, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think you must be wicked: and I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, I am not. Those are bad words, and wicked people often\r\nsay them of others better than themselves. Those words cannot make\r\npeople be damned, nor show that they deserve it. God will judge us by\r\nour own thoughts and deeds, not by what others say about us. And when\r\nyou hear such words spoken, Arthur, remember never to repeat them: it\r\nis wicked to say such things of others, not to have them said against\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s papa that\xe2\x80\x99s wicked,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, ruefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa is wrong to say such things, and you will be very wrong to\r\nimitate him now that you know better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ imitate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo do as he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes _he_ know better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he does; but that is nothing to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, you ought to tell him, mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ told him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little moralist paused and pondered. I tried in vain to divert his\r\nmind from the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry papa\xe2\x80\x99s wicked,\xe2\x80\x9d said he mournfully, at length, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant him to go to hell.\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying he burst into tears.\r\n\r\nI consoled him with the hope that perhaps his papa would alter and\r\nbecome good before he died\xe2\x80\x94; but is it not time to deliver him from\r\nsuch a parent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 10th, 1827.\xe2\x80\x94While writing the above, yesterday evening, I sat\r\nin the drawing-room. Mr. Huntingdon was present, but, as I thought,\r\nasleep on the sofa behind me. He had risen, however, unknown to me,\r\nand, actuated by some base spirit of curiosity, been looking over my\r\nshoulder for I know not how long; for when I had laid aside my pen, and\r\nwas about to close the book, he suddenly placed his hand upon it, and\r\nsaying,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWith your leave, my dear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look at this,\xe2\x80\x9d forcibly\r\nwrested it from me, and, drawing a chair to the table, composedly sat\r\ndown to examine it: turning back leaf after leaf to find an explanation\r\nof what he had read. Unluckily for me, he was more sober that night\r\nthan he usually is at such an hour.\r\n\r\nOf course I did not leave him to pursue this occupation in quiet: I\r\nmade several attempts to snatch the book from his hands, but he held it\r\ntoo firmly for that; I upbraided him in bitterness and scorn for his\r\nmean and dishonourable conduct, but that had no effect upon him; and,\r\nfinally, I extinguished both the candles, but he only wheeled round to\r\nthe fire, and raising a blaze sufficient for his purposes, calmly\r\ncontinued the investigation. I had serious thoughts of getting a\r\npitcher of water and extinguishing that light too; but it was evident\r\nhis curiosity was too keenly excited to be quenched by that, and the\r\nmore I manifested my anxiety to baffle his scrutiny, the greater would\r\nbe his determination to persist in it, besides it was too late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems very interesting, love,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, lifting his head and\r\nturning to where I stood, wringing my hands in silent rage and anguish;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s rather long; I\xe2\x80\x99ll look at it some other time; and meanwhile\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you for your keys, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat keys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe keys of your cabinet, desk, drawers, and whatever else you\r\npossess,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rising and holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not got them,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. The key of my desk, in fact, was at\r\nthat moment in the lock, and the others were attached to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must send for them,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cand if that old devil, Rachel,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately deliver them up, she tramps bag and baggage\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know where they are,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, quietly placing my hand\r\nupon them, and taking them from the desk, as I thought, unobserved.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ know, but I shall not give them up without a reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _I_ know, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly seizing my closed hand and\r\nrudely abstracting them from it. He then took up one of the candles and\r\nrelighted it by thrusting it into the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must have a confiscation of property. But,\r\nfirst, let us take a peep into the studio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd putting the keys into his pocket, he walked into the library. I\r\nfollowed, whether with the dim idea of preventing mischief, or only to\r\nknow the worst, I can hardly tell. My painting materials were laid\r\ntogether on the corner table, ready for to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s use, and only\r\ncovered with a cloth. He soon spied them out, and putting down the\r\ncandle, deliberately proceeded to cast them into the fire: palette,\r\npaints, bladders, pencils, brushes, varnish: I saw them all consumed:\r\nthe palette-knives snapped in two, the oil and turpentine sent hissing\r\nand roaring up the chimney. He then rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBenson, take those things away,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pointing to the easel,\r\ncanvas, and stretcher; \xe2\x80\x9cand tell the housemaid she may kindle the fire\r\nwith them: your mistress won\xe2\x80\x99t want them any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenson paused aghast and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake them away, Benson,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and his master muttered an oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this and all, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the astonished servant, referring to the\r\nhalf-finished picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat and all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the master; and the things were cleared away.\r\n\r\nMr. Huntingdon then went up-stairs. I did not attempt to follow him,\r\nbut remained seated in the arm-chair, speechless, tearless, and almost\r\nmotionless, till he returned about half-an-hour after, and walking up\r\nto me, held the candle in my face and peered into my eyes with looks\r\nand laughter too insulting to be borne. With a sudden stroke of my hand\r\nI dashed the candle to the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHal-lo!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered he, starting back; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s the very devil for spite.\r\nDid _ever_ any mortal see such eyes?\xe2\x80\x94they shine in the dark like a\r\ncat\xe2\x80\x99s. _Oh_, you\xe2\x80\x99re a sweet one!\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he gathered up the candle\r\nand the candlestick. The former being broken as well as extinguished,\r\nhe rang for another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBenson, your mistress has broken the candle; bring another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou expose yourself finely,\xe2\x80\x9d observed I, as the man departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say _I\xe2\x80\x99d_ broken it, did I?\xe2\x80\x9d returned he. He then threw my\r\nkeys into my lap, saying,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThere! you\xe2\x80\x99ll find nothing gone but your\r\nmoney, and the jewels, and a few little trifles I thought it advisable\r\nto take into my own possession, lest your mercantile spirit should be\r\ntempted to turn them into gold. I\xe2\x80\x99ve left you a few sovereigns in your\r\npurse, which I expect to last you through the month; at all events,\r\nwhen you want more you will be so good as to give me an account of how\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s spent. I shall put you upon a small monthly allowance, in\r\nfuture, for your own private expenses; and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself\r\nany more about my concerns; I shall look out for a steward, my dear\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t expose you to the temptation. And as for the household matters,\r\nMrs. Greaves must be very particular in keeping her accounts; we must\r\ngo upon an entirely new plan\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat great discovery have you made now, Mr. Huntingdon? Have I\r\nattempted to defraud you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in money matters, exactly, it seems; but it\xe2\x80\x99s best to keep out of\r\nthe way of temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Benson entered with the candles, and there followed a brief\r\ninterval of silence; I sitting still in my chair, and he standing with\r\nhis back to the fire, silently triumphing in my despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at length, \xe2\x80\x9cyou thought to disgrace me, did you, by\r\nrunning away and turning artist, and supporting yourself by the labour\r\nof your hands, forsooth? And you thought to rob me of my son, too, and\r\nbring him up to be a dirty Yankee tradesman, or a low, beggarly\r\npainter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to obviate his becoming such a gentleman as his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s well you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep your own secret\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha! It\xe2\x80\x99s well these\r\nwomen must be blabbing. If they haven\xe2\x80\x99t a friend to talk to, they must\r\nwhisper their secrets to the fishes, or write them on the sand, or\r\nsomething; and it\xe2\x80\x99s well, too, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over full to-night, now I think\r\nof it, or I might have snoozed away and never dreamt of looking what my\r\nsweet lady was about; or I might have lacked the sense or the power to\r\ncarry my point like a man, as I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaving him to his self-congratulations, I rose to secure my\r\nmanuscript, for I now remembered it had been left upon the drawing-room\r\ntable, and I determined, if possible, to save myself the humiliation of\r\nseeing it in his hands again. I could not bear the idea of his amusing\r\nhimself over my secret thoughts and recollections; though, to be sure,\r\nhe would find little good of himself therein indited, except in the\r\nformer part; and oh, I would sooner burn it all than he should read\r\nwhat I had written when I was such a fool as to love him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by-the-by,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, as I was leaving the room, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\ntell that d\xe2\x80\x94d old sneak of a nurse to keep out of my way for a day or\r\ntwo; I\xe2\x80\x99d pay her her wages and send her packing to-morrow, but I know\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d do more mischief out of the house than in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as I departed, he went on cursing and abusing my faithful friend\r\nand servant with epithets I will not defile this paper with repeating.\r\nI went to her as soon as I had put away my book, and told her how our\r\nproject was defeated. She was as much distressed and horrified as I\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94and more so than I was that night, for I was partly stunned by the\r\nblow, and partly excited and supported against it by the bitterness of\r\nmy wrath. But in the morning, when I woke without that cheering hope\r\nthat had been my secret comfort and support so long, and all this day,\r\nwhen I have wandered about restless and objectless, shunning my\r\nhusband, shrinking even from my child, knowing that I am unfit to be\r\nhis teacher or companion, hoping nothing for his future life, and\r\nfervently wishing he had never been born,\xe2\x80\x94I felt the full extent of my\r\ncalamity, and I feel it now. I know that day after day such feelings\r\nwill return upon me. I am a slave\xe2\x80\x94a prisoner\xe2\x80\x94but that is nothing; if it\r\nwere myself alone I would not complain, but I am forbidden to rescue my\r\nson from ruin, and what was once my only consolation is become the\r\ncrowning source of my despair.\r\n\r\nHave I no faith in God? I try to look to Him and raise my heart to\r\nheaven, but it will cleave to the dust. I can only say, \xe2\x80\x9cHe hath hedged\r\nme about, that I cannot get out: He hath made my chain heavy. He hath\r\nfilled me with bitterness\xe2\x80\x94He hath made me drunken with wormwood.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nforget to add, \xe2\x80\x9cBut though He cause grief, yet will He have compassion\r\naccording to the multitude of His mercies. For He doth not afflict\r\nwillingly nor grieve the children of men.\xe2\x80\x9d I ought to think of this;\r\nand if there be nothing but sorrow for me in this world, what is the\r\nlongest life of misery to a whole eternity of peace? And for my little\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x94has he no friend but me? Who was it said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the will of\r\nyour Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should\r\nperish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 20th.\xe2\x80\x94Having now got rid of Mr. Huntingdon for a season, my\r\nspirits begin to revive. He left me early in February; and the moment\r\nhe was gone, I breathed again, and felt my vital energy return; not\r\nwith the hope of escape\xe2\x80\x94he has taken care to leave me no visible chance\r\nof that\xe2\x80\x94but with a determination to make the best of existing\r\ncircumstances. Here was Arthur left to me at last; and rousing from my\r\ndespondent apathy, I exerted all my powers to eradicate the weeds that\r\nhad been fostered in his infant mind, and sow again the good seed they\r\nhad rendered unproductive. Thank heaven, it is not a barren or a stony\r\nsoil; if weeds spring fast there, so do better plants. His\r\napprehensions are more quick, his heart more overflowing with affection\r\nthan ever his father\xe2\x80\x99s could have been, and it is no hopeless task to\r\nbend him to obedience and win him to love and know his own true friend,\r\nas long as there is no one to counteract my efforts.\r\n\r\nI had much trouble at first in breaking him of those evil habits his\r\nfather had taught him to acquire, but already that difficulty is nearly\r\nvanquished now: bad language seldom defiles his mouth, and I have\r\nsucceeded in giving him an absolute disgust for all intoxicating\r\nliquors, which I hope not even his father or his father\xe2\x80\x99s friends will\r\nbe able to overcome. He was inordinately fond of them for so young a\r\ncreature, and, remembering my unfortunate father as well as his, I\r\ndreaded the consequences of such a taste. But if I had stinted him, in\r\nhis usual quantity of wine, or forbidden him to taste it altogether,\r\nthat would only have increased his partiality for it, and made him\r\nregard it as a greater treat than ever. I therefore gave him quite as\r\nmuch as his father was accustomed to allow him; as much, indeed, as he\r\ndesired to have\xe2\x80\x94but into every glass I surreptitiously introduced a\r\nsmall quantity of tartar-emetic, just enough to produce inevitable\r\nnausea and depression without positive sickness. Finding such\r\ndisagreeable consequences invariably to result from this indulgence, he\r\nsoon grew weary of it, but the more he shrank from the daily treat the\r\nmore I pressed it upon him, till his reluctance was strengthened to\r\nperfect abhorrence. When he was thoroughly disgusted with every kind of\r\nwine, I allowed him, at his own request, to try brandy-and-water, and\r\nthen gin-and-water, for the little toper was familiar with them all,\r\nand I was determined that all should be equally hateful to him. This I\r\nhave now effected; and since he declares that the taste, the smell, the\r\nsight of any one of them is sufficient to make him sick, I have given\r\nup teasing him about them, except now and then as objects of terror in\r\ncases of misbehaviour. \xe2\x80\x9cArthur, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not a good boy I shall give\r\nyou a glass of wine,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Arthur, if you say that again you shall\r\nhave some brandy-and-water,\xe2\x80\x9d is as good as any other threat; and once\r\nor twice, when he was sick, I have obliged the poor child to swallow a\r\nlittle wine-and-water _without_ the tartar-emetic, by way of medicine;\r\nand this practice I intend to continue for some time to come; not that\r\nI think it of any real service in a physical sense, but because I am\r\ndetermined to enlist all the powers of association in my service; I\r\nwish this aversion to be so deeply grounded in his nature that nothing\r\nin after-life may be able to overcome it.\r\n\r\nThus, I flatter myself, I shall secure him from this one vice; and for\r\nthe rest, if on his father\xe2\x80\x99s return I find reason to apprehend that my\r\ngood lessons will be all destroyed\xe2\x80\x94if Mr. Huntingdon commence again the\r\ngame of teaching the child to hate and despise his mother, and emulate\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s wickedness\xe2\x80\x94I will yet deliver my son from his hands. I\r\nhave devised another scheme that might be resorted to in such a case;\r\nand if I could but obtain my brother\xe2\x80\x99s consent and assistance, I should\r\nnot doubt of its success. The old hall where he and I were born, and\r\nwhere our mother died, is not now inhabited, nor yet quite sunk into\r\ndecay, as I believe. Now, if I could persuade him to have one or two\r\nrooms made habitable, and to let them to me as a stranger, I might live\r\nthere, with my child, under an assumed name, and still support myself\r\nby my favourite art. He should lend me the money to begin with, and I\r\nwould pay him back, and live in lowly independence and strict\r\nseclusion, for the house stands in a lonely place, and the\r\nneighbourhood is thinly inhabited, and he himself should negotiate the\r\nsale of my pictures for me. I have arranged the whole plan in my head:\r\nand all I want is to persuade Frederick to be of the same mind as\r\nmyself. He is coming to see me soon, and then I will make the proposal\r\nto him, having first enlightened him upon my circumstances sufficiently\r\nto excuse the project.\r\n\r\nAlready, I believe, he knows much more of my situation than I have told\r\nhim. I can tell this by the air of tender sadness pervading his\r\nletters; and by the fact of his so seldom mentioning my husband, and\r\ngenerally evincing a kind of covert bitterness when he does refer to\r\nhim; as well as by the circumstance of his never coming to see me when\r\nMr. Huntingdon is at home. But he has never openly expressed any\r\ndisapprobation of him or sympathy for me; he has never asked any\r\nquestions, or said anything to invite my confidence. Had he done so, I\r\nshould probably have had but few concealments from him. Perhaps he\r\nfeels hurt at my reserve. He is a strange being; I wish we knew each\r\nother better. He used to spend a month at Staningley every year, before\r\nI was married; but, since our father\xe2\x80\x99s death, I have only seen him\r\nonce, when he came for a few days while Mr. Huntingdon was away. He\r\nshall stay many days this time, and there shall be more candour and\r\ncordiality between us than ever there was before, since our early\r\nchildhood. My heart clings to him more than ever; and my soul is sick\r\nof solitude.\r\n\r\nApril 16th.\xe2\x80\x94He is come and gone. He would not stay above a fortnight.\r\nThe time passed quickly, but very, very happily, and it has done me\r\ngood. I must have a bad disposition, for my misfortunes have soured and\r\nembittered me exceedingly: I was beginning insensibly to cherish very\r\nunamiable feelings against my fellow-mortals, the male part of them\r\nespecially; but it is a comfort to see there is at least one among them\r\nworthy to be trusted and esteemed; and doubtless there are more, though\r\nI have never known them, unless I except poor Lord Lowborough, and he\r\nwas bad enough in his day. But what would Frederick have been, if he\r\nhad lived in the world, and mingled from his childhood with such men as\r\nthese of my acquaintance? and what _will_ Arthur be, with all his\r\nnatural sweetness of disposition, if I do not save him from that world\r\nand those companions? I mentioned my fears to Frederick, and introduced\r\nthe subject of my plan of rescue on the evening after his arrival, when\r\nI presented my little son to his uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is like you, Frederick,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cin some of his moods: I sometimes\r\nthink he resembles you more than his father; and I am glad of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou flatter me, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, stroking the child\xe2\x80\x99s soft, wavy\r\nlocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you will think it no compliment when I tell you I would rather\r\nhave him to resemble _Benson_ than his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe slightly elevated his eyebrows, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what sort of man Mr. Huntingdon is?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I have an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you so clear an idea that you can hear, without surprise or\r\ndisapproval, that I meditate escaping with that child to some secret\r\nasylum, where we can live in peace, and never see him again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have not,\xe2\x80\x9d continued I, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something more about\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x9d; and I gave a sketch of his general conduct, and a more particular\r\naccount of his behaviour with regard to his child, and explained my\r\napprehensions on the latter\xe2\x80\x99s account, and my determination to deliver\r\nhim from his father\xe2\x80\x99s influence.\r\n\r\nFrederick was exceedingly indignant against Mr. Huntingdon, and very\r\nmuch grieved for me; but still he looked upon my project as wild and\r\nimpracticable. He deemed my fears for Arthur disproportioned to the\r\ncircumstances, and opposed so many objections to my plan, and devised\r\nso many milder methods for ameliorating my condition, that I was\r\nobliged to enter into further details to convince him that my husband\r\nwas utterly incorrigible, and that nothing could persuade him to give\r\nup his son, whatever became of me, he being as fully determined the\r\nchild should not leave him, as I was not to leave the child; and that,\r\nin fact, nothing would answer but this, unless I fled the country, as I\r\nhad intended before. To obviate that, he at length consented to have\r\none wing of the old hall put into a habitable condition, as a place of\r\nrefuge against a time of need; but hoped I would not take advantage of\r\nit unless circumstances should render it really necessary, which I was\r\nready enough to promise: for though, for my own sake, such a hermitage\r\nappears like paradise itself, compared with my present situation, yet\r\nfor my friends\xe2\x80\x99 sakes, for Milicent and Esther, my sisters in heart and\r\naffection, for the poor tenants of Grassdale, and, above all, for my\r\naunt, I will stay if I possibly can.\r\n\r\nJuly 29th.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Hargrave and her daughter are come back from London.\r\nEsther is full of her first season in town; but she is still\r\nheart-whole and unengaged. Her mother sought out an excellent match for\r\nher, and even brought the gentleman to lay his heart and fortune at her\r\nfeet; but Esther had the audacity to refuse the noble gifts. He was a\r\nman of good family and large possessions, but the naughty girl\r\nmaintained he was old as Adam, ugly as sin, and hateful as\xe2\x80\x94one who\r\nshall be nameless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, indeed, I had a hard time of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said she: \xe2\x80\x9cmamma was very\r\ngreatly disappointed at the failure of her darling project, and very,\r\nvery angry at my obstinate resistance to her will, and is so still; but\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. And Walter, too, is so seriously displeased at my\r\nperversity and absurd caprice, as he calls it, that I fear he will\r\nnever forgive me\xe2\x80\x94I did not think he _could_ be so unkind as he has\r\nlately shown himself. But Milicent begged me not to yield, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure, Mrs. Huntingdon, if you had seen the man they wanted to palm upon\r\nme, you would have advised me not to take him too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have done so whether I had seen him or not,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cit is\r\nenough that you dislike him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would say so; though mamma affirmed you would be quite\r\nshocked at my undutiful conduct. You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how she lectures me:\r\nI am disobedient and ungrateful; I am thwarting her wishes, wronging my\r\nbrother, and making myself a burden on her hands. I sometimes fear\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll overcome me after all. I have a strong will, but so has she, and\r\nwhen she says such bitter things, it provokes me to such a pass that I\r\nfeel inclined to do as she bids me, and then break my heart and say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, mamma, it\xe2\x80\x99s all your fault!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cObedience from such a motive would be positive\r\nwickedness, and certain to bring the punishment it deserves. Stand\r\nfirm, and your mamma will soon relinquish her persecution; and the\r\ngentleman himself will cease to pester you with his addresses if he\r\nfinds them steadily rejected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! mamma will weary all about her before she tires herself with\r\nher exertions; and as for Mr. Oldfield, she has given him to understand\r\nthat I have refused his offer, not from any dislike of his person, but\r\nmerely because I am giddy and young, and cannot at present reconcile\r\nmyself to the thoughts of marriage under any circumstances: but by next\r\nseason, she has no doubt, I shall have more sense, and hopes my girlish\r\nfancies will be worn away. So she has brought me home, to school me\r\ninto a proper sense of my duty, against the time comes round again.\r\nIndeed, I believe she will not put herself to the expense of taking me\r\nup to London again, unless I surrender: she cannot afford to take me to\r\ntown for pleasure and nonsense, she says, and it is not _every_ rich\r\ngentleman that will consent to take me without a fortune, whatever\r\nexalted ideas I may have of my own attractions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Esther, I pity you; but still, I repeat, stand firm. You might\r\nas well sell yourself to slavery at once, as marry a man you dislike.\r\nIf your mother and brother are unkind to you, you may leave them, but\r\nremember you are bound to your husband for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot leave them unless I get married, and I cannot get married\r\nif nobody sees me. I saw one or two gentlemen in London that I might\r\nhave liked, but they were younger sons, and mamma would not let me get\r\nto know them\xe2\x80\x94one especially, who I believe rather liked me\xe2\x80\x94but she\r\nthrew every possible obstacle in the way of our better acquaintance.\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it provoking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you would feel it so, but it is possible that if you\r\nmarried him, you might have more reason to regret it hereafter than if\r\nyou married Mr. Oldfield. When I tell you not to marry _without_ love,\r\nI do not advise you to marry for love alone: there are many, many other\r\nthings to be considered. Keep both heart and hand in your own\r\npossession, till you see good reason to part with them; and if such an\r\noccasion should never present itself, comfort your mind with this\r\nreflection, that though in single life your joys may not be very many,\r\nyour sorrows, at least, will not be more than you can bear. Marriage\r\n_may_ change your circumstances for the better, but, in my private\r\nopinion, it is far more likely to produce a contrary result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo thinks Milicent; but allow me to say _I_ think otherwise. If I\r\nthought myself doomed to old-maidenhood, I should cease to value my\r\nlife. The thoughts of living on, year after year, at the Grove\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhanger-on upon mamma and Walter, a mere cumberer of the ground (now\r\nthat I know in what light they would regard it), is perfectly\r\nintolerable; I would rather run away with the butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour circumstances are peculiar, I allow; but have patience, love; do\r\nnothing rashly. Remember you are not yet nineteen, and many years are\r\nyet to pass before any one can set you down as an old maid: you cannot\r\ntell what Providence may have in store for you. And meantime, remember\r\nyou have a _right_ to the protection and support of your mother and\r\nbrother, however they may seem to grudge it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so grave, Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Esther, after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nMilicent uttered the same discouraging sentiments concerning marriage,\r\nI asked if she was happy: she said she was; but I only half believed\r\nher; and now I must put the same question to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very impertinent question,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed I, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a young girl to a\r\nmarried woman so many years her senior, and I shall not answer it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, dear _madam_,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughingly throwing herself into\r\nmy arms, and kissing me with playful affection; but I felt a tear on my\r\nneck, as she dropped her head on my bosom and continued, with an odd\r\nmixture of sadness and levity, timidity and audacity,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know you are\r\nnot so happy as I mean to be, for you spend half your life alone at\r\nGrassdale, while Mr. Huntingdon goes about enjoying himself where and\r\nhow he pleases. I shall expect _my_ husband to have no pleasures but\r\nwhat he shares with me; and if his greatest pleasure of all is not the\r\nenjoyment of my company, why, it will be the worse for him, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf such are your expectations of matrimony, Esther, you must, indeed,\r\nbe careful whom you marry\xe2\x80\x94or rather, you must avoid it altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 1st.\xe2\x80\x94No Mr. Huntingdon yet. Perhaps he will stay among his\r\nfriends till Christmas; and then, next spring, he will be off again. If\r\nhe continue this plan, I shall be able to stay at Grassdale well\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94that is, I _shall_ be able to stay, and that is enough; even an\r\noccasional bevy of friends at the shooting season may be borne, if\r\nArthur get so firmly attached to me, so well established in good sense\r\nand principles before they come that I shall be able, by reason and\r\naffection, to keep him pure from their contaminations. Vain hope, I\r\nfear! but still, till such a time of trial comes I will forbear to\r\nthink of my quiet asylum in the beloved old hall.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hattersley have been staying at the Grove a fortnight: and\r\nas Mr. Hargrave is still absent, and the weather was remarkably fine, I\r\nnever passed a day without seeing my two friends, Milicent and Esther,\r\neither there or here. On one occasion, when Mr. Hattersley had driven\r\nthem over to Grassdale in the phaeton, with little Helen and Ralph, and\r\nwe were all enjoying ourselves in the garden\xe2\x80\x94I had a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nconversation with that gentleman, while the ladies were amusing\r\nthemselves with the children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to hear anything of your husband, Mrs. Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, unless you can tell me when to expect him home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t want him, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a broad grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re better without him, sure enough\xe2\x80\x94for my part, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndownright weary of him. I told him I\xe2\x80\x99d leave him if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mend his\r\nmanners, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; so I left him. You see, I\xe2\x80\x99m a better man than\r\nyou think me; and, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I have serious thoughts of washing my\r\nhands of him entirely, and the whole set of \xe2\x80\x99em, and comporting myself\r\nfrom this day forward with all decency and sobriety, as a Christian and\r\nthe father of a family should do. What do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a resolution you ought to have formed long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not thirty yet; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too late, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it is never too late to reform, as long as you have the sense to\r\ndesire it, and the strength to execute your purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to tell you the truth, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of it often and often\r\nbefore; but he\xe2\x80\x99s such devilish good company, is Huntingdon, after all.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what a jovial good fellow he is when he\xe2\x80\x99s not fairly\r\ndrunk, only just primed or half-seas-over. We all have a bit of a\r\nliking for him at the bottom of our hearts, though we can\xe2\x80\x99t respect\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut should you wish yourself to be like him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be like myself, bad as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t continue as bad as you are without getting worse and more\r\nbrutalised every day, and therefore more like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help smiling at the comical, half-angry, half-confounded\r\nlook he put on at this rather unusual mode of address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind my plain speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cit is from the best of\r\nmotives. But tell me, should you wish your sons to be like Mr.\r\nHuntingdon\xe2\x80\x94or even like yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it! no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you wish your daughter to despise you\xe2\x80\x94or, at least, to feel no\r\nvestige of respect for you, and no affection but what is mingled with\r\nthe bitterest regret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, finally, should you wish your wife to be ready to sink into the\r\nearth when she hears you mentioned; and to loathe the very sound of\r\nyour voice, and shudder at your approach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never will; she likes me all the same, whatever I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, Mr. Hattersley! you mistake her quiet submission for\r\naffection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire and fury\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t burst into a tempest at that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say she does\r\nnot love you\xe2\x80\x94she does, I know, a great deal better than you deserve;\r\nbut I am quite sure, that if you behave better, she will love you more,\r\nand if you behave worse, she will love you less and less, till all is\r\nlost in fear, aversion, and bitterness of soul, if not in secret hatred\r\nand contempt. But, dropping the subject of affection, should you wish\r\nto be the tyrant of her life\xe2\x80\x94to take away all the sunshine from her\r\nexistence, and make her thoroughly miserable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done more towards it than you suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh, pooh! she\xe2\x80\x99s not the susceptible, anxious, worriting creature you\r\nimagine: she\xe2\x80\x99s a little meek, peaceable, affectionate body; apt to be\r\nrather sulky at times, but quiet and cool in the main, and ready to\r\ntake things as they come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of what she was five years ago, when you married her, and what\r\nshe is now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know she was a little plump lassie then, with a pretty pink and\r\nwhite face: now she\xe2\x80\x99s a poor little bit of a creature, fading and\r\nmelting away like a snow-wreath. But hang it!\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the cause of it then? Not years, for she\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nfive-and-twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s her own delicate health, and confound it, madam! what would you\r\nmake of me?\xe2\x80\x94and the children, to be sure, that worry her to death\r\nbetween them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Hattersley, the children give her more pleasure than pain:\r\nthey are fine, well-dispositioned children\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know they are\xe2\x80\x94bless them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why lay the blame on them?\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is: it\xe2\x80\x99s silent\r\nfretting and constant anxiety on your account, mingled, I suspect, with\r\nsomething of bodily fear on her own. When you behave well, she can only\r\nrejoice with trembling; she has no security, no confidence in your\r\njudgment or principles; but is continually dreading the close of such\r\nshort-lived felicity; when you behave ill, her causes of terror and\r\nmisery are more than any one can tell but herself. In patient endurance\r\nof evil, she forgets it is our duty to admonish our neighbours of their\r\ntransgressions. Since you _will_ mistake her silence for indifference,\r\ncome with me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you one or two of her letters\xe2\x80\x94no breach of\r\nconfidence, I hope, since you are her other half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe followed me into the library. I sought out and put into his hands\r\ntwo of Milicent\xe2\x80\x99s letters: one dated from London, and written during\r\none of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation; the other in the\r\ncountry, during a lucid interval. The former was full of trouble and\r\nanguish; not accusing _him_, but deeply regretting his connection with\r\nhis profligate companions, abusing Mr. Grimsby and others, insinuating\r\nbitter things against Mr. Huntingdon, and most ingeniously throwing the\r\nblame of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct on to other men\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. The\r\nlatter was full of hope and joy, yet with a trembling consciousness\r\nthat this happiness would not last; praising his goodness to the skies,\r\nbut with an evident, though but half-expressed wish, that it were based\r\non a surer foundation than the natural impulses of the heart, and a\r\nhalf-prophetic dread of the fall of that house so founded on the\r\nsand,\xe2\x80\x94which fall had shortly after taken place, as Hattersley must have\r\nbeen conscious while he read.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the commencement of the first letter I had the unexpected\r\npleasure of seeing him blush; but he immediately turned his back to me,\r\nand finished the perusal at the window. At the second, I saw him, once\r\nor twice, raise his hand, and hurriedly pass it across his face. Could\r\nit be to dash away a tear? When he had done, there was an interval\r\nspent in clearing his throat and staring out of the window, and then,\r\nafter whistling a few bars of a favourite air, he turned round, gave me\r\nback the letters, and silently shook me by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a cursed rascal, God knows,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he gave it a hearty\r\nsqueeze, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you see if I don\xe2\x80\x99t make amends for it\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x94n me if I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t curse yourself, Mr. Hattersley; if God had heard half your\r\ninvocations of that kind, you would have been in hell long before\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94and you _cannot_ make amends for the past by doing your duty for\r\nthe future, inasmuch as your duty is only what you _owe_ to your Maker,\r\nand you cannot do _more_ than fulfil it: another must make amends for\r\nyour past delinquencies. If you intend to reform, invoke God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblessing, His mercy, and His aid; not His curse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help me, then\xe2\x80\x94for I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I need it. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Milicent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s there, just coming in with her sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped out at the glass door, and went to meet them. I followed at\r\na little distance. Somewhat to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, he lifted her\r\noff from the ground, and saluted her with a hearty kiss and a strong\r\nembrace; then placing his two hands on her shoulders, he gave her, I\r\nsuppose, a sketch of the great things he meant to do, for she suddenly\r\nthrew her arms round him, and burst into tears, exclaiming,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo, do,\r\nRalph\xe2\x80\x94we shall be so happy! How very, very good you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, not I,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning her round, and pushing her towards me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank _her;_ it\xe2\x80\x99s her doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilicent flew to thank me, overflowing with gratitude. I disclaimed all\r\ntitle to it, telling her her husband was predisposed to amendment\r\nbefore I added my mite of exhortation and encouragement, and that I had\r\nonly done what she might, and ought to have done herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she; \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have influenced him, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, by\r\nanything that I could have said. I should only have bothered him by my\r\nclumsy efforts at persuasion, if I had made the attempt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never tried me, Milly,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nShortly after they took their leave. They are now gone on a visit to\r\nHattersley\xe2\x80\x99s father. After that they will repair to their country home.\r\nI hope his good resolutions will not fall through, and poor Milicent\r\nwill not be again disappointed. Her last letter was full of present\r\nbliss, and pleasing anticipations for the future; but no particular\r\ntemptation has yet occurred to put his virtue to the test. Henceforth,\r\nhowever, she will doubtless be somewhat less timid and reserved, and he\r\nmore kind and thoughtful.\xe2\x80\x94Surely, then, her hopes are not unfounded;\r\nand I have one bright spot, at least, whereon to rest my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 10th.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Huntingdon returned about three weeks ago. His\r\nappearance, his demeanour and conversation, and my feelings with regard\r\nto him, I shall not trouble myself to describe. The day after his\r\narrival, however, he surprised me by the announcement of an intention\r\nto procure a governess for little Arthur: I told him it was quite\r\nunnecessary, not to say ridiculous, at the present season: I thought I\r\nwas fully competent to the task of teaching him myself\xe2\x80\x94for some years\r\nto come, at least: the child\xe2\x80\x99s education was the only pleasure and\r\nbusiness of my life; and since he had deprived me of every other\r\noccupation, he might surely leave me that.\r\n\r\nHe said I was not fit to teach children, or to be with them: I had\r\nalready reduced the boy to little better than an automaton; I had\r\nbroken his fine spirit with my rigid severity; and I should freeze all\r\nthe sunshine out of his heart, and make him as gloomy an ascetic as\r\nmyself, if I had the handling of him much longer. And poor Rachel, too,\r\ncame in for her share of abuse, as usual; he cannot endure Rachel,\r\nbecause he knows she has a proper appreciation of him.\r\n\r\nI calmly defended our several qualifications as nurse and governess,\r\nand still resisted the proposed addition to our family; but he cut me\r\nshort by saying it was no use bothering about the matter, for he had\r\nengaged a governess already, and she was coming next week; so that all\r\nI had to do was to get things ready for her reception. This was a\r\nrather startling piece of intelligence. I ventured to inquire her name\r\nand address, by whom she had been recommended, or how he had been led\r\nto make choice of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a very estimable, pious young person,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid. Her name is Myers, I believe; and she was recommended to me by\r\na respectable old dowager: a lady of high repute in the religious\r\nworld. I have not seen her myself, and therefore cannot give you a\r\nparticular account of her person and conversation, and so forth; but,\r\nif the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s eulogies are correct, you will find her to possess\r\nall desirable qualifications for her position: an inordinate love of\r\nchildren among the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this was gravely and quietly spoken, but there was a laughing demon\r\nin his half-averted eye that boded no good, I imagined. However, I\r\nthought of my asylum in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94shire, and made no further objections.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Myers arrived, I was not prepared to give her a very cordial\r\nreception. Her appearance was not particularly calculated to produce a\r\nfavourable impression at first sight, nor did her manners and\r\nsubsequent conduct, in any degree, remove the prejudice I had already\r\nconceived against her. Her attainments were limited, her intellect\r\nnoways above mediocrity. She had a fine voice, and could sing like a\r\nnightingale, and accompany herself sufficiently well on the piano; but\r\nthese were her only accomplishments. There was a look of guile and\r\nsubtlety in her face, a sound of it in her voice. She seemed afraid of\r\nme, and would start if I suddenly approached her. In her behaviour she\r\nwas respectful and complaisant, even to servility: she attempted to\r\nflatter and fawn upon me at first, but I soon checked that. Her\r\nfondness for her little pupil was overstrained, and I was obliged to\r\nremonstrate with her on the subject of over-indulgence and injudicious\r\npraise; but she could not gain his heart. Her piety consisted in an\r\noccasional heaving of sighs, and uplifting of eyes to the ceiling, and\r\nthe utterance of a few cant phrases. She told me she was a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, and had been left an orphan from her childhood, but had had\r\nthe good fortune to obtain a situation in a very pious family; and then\r\nshe spoke so gratefully of the kindness she had experienced from its\r\ndifferent members, that I reproached myself for my uncharitable\r\nthoughts and unfriendly conduct, and relented for a time, but not for\r\nlong: my causes of dislike were too rational, my suspicions too well\r\nfounded for that; and I knew it was my duty to watch and scrutinize\r\ntill those suspicions were either satisfactorily removed or confirmed.\r\n\r\nI asked the name and residence of the kind and pious family. She\r\nmentioned a common name, and an unknown and distant place of abode, but\r\ntold me they were now on the Continent, and their present address was\r\nunknown to her. I never saw her speak much to Mr. Huntingdon; but he\r\nwould frequently look into the school-room to see how little Arthur got\r\non with his new companion, when I was not there. In the evening, she\r\nsat with us in the drawing-room, and would sing and play to amuse him\r\nor us, as she pretended, and was very attentive to his wants, and\r\nwatchful to anticipate them, though she only talked to me; indeed, he\r\nwas seldom in a condition to be talked to. Had she been other than she\r\nwas, I should have felt her presence a great relief to come between us\r\nthus, except, indeed, that I should have been thoroughly ashamed for\r\nany decent person to see him as he often was.\r\n\r\nI did not mention my suspicions to Rachel; but she, having sojourned\r\nfor half a century in this land of sin and sorrow, has learned to be\r\nsuspicious herself. She told me from the first she was \xe2\x80\x9cdown of that\r\nnew governess,\xe2\x80\x9d and I soon found she watched her quite as narrowly as I\r\ndid; and I was glad of it, for I longed to know the truth: the\r\natmosphere of Grassdale seemed to stifle me, and I could only live by\r\nthinking of Wildfell Hall.\r\n\r\nAt last, one morning, she entered my chamber with such intelligence\r\nthat my resolution was taken before she had ceased to speak. While she\r\ndressed me I explained to her my intentions and what assistance I\r\nshould require from her, and told her which of my things she was to\r\npack up, and what she was to leave behind for herself, as I had no\r\nother means of recompensing her for this sudden dismissal after her\r\nlong and faithful service: a circumstance I most deeply regretted, but\r\ncould not avoid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will you do, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you go home, or seek\r\nanother place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no home, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, but with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I leave you\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never go into place again as long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to live like a lady now,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I: \xe2\x80\x9cI must be my\r\nown maid and my child\xe2\x80\x99s nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _signifies!_\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, in some excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll want\r\nsomebody to clean and wash, and cook, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I can do all that; and\r\nnever mind the wages: I\xe2\x80\x99ve my bits o\xe2\x80\x99 savings yet, and if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake me I should have to find my own board and lodging out of \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nsomewhere, or else work among strangers: and it\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to:\r\nso you can please yourself, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice quavered as she spoke,\r\nand the tears stood in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like it above all things, Rachel, and I\xe2\x80\x99d give you such wages\r\nas I could afford: such as I should give to any servant-of-all-work I\r\nmight employ: but don\xe2\x80\x99t you see I should be dragging you down with me\r\nwhen you have done nothing to deserve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, fiddle!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, besides, my future way of living will be so widely different to\r\nthe past: so different to all you have been accustomed to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear what my missis can? surely I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nso proud and so dainty as that comes to; and my little master, too, God\r\nbless him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m young, Rachel; I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t mind it; and Arthur is young too: it\r\nwill be nothing to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor me either: I\xe2\x80\x99m not so old but what I can stand hard fare and hard\r\nwork, if it\xe2\x80\x99s only to help and comfort them as I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved like my own\r\nbairns: for all I\xe2\x80\x99m too old to bide the thoughts o\xe2\x80\x99 leaving \xe2\x80\x99em in\r\ntrouble and danger, and going amongst strangers myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t, Rachel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, embracing my faithful friend.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll all go together, and you shall see how the new life suits you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, honey!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, affectionately returning my embrace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly let us get shut of this wicked house, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do right enough,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo think I,\xe2\x80\x9d was my answer; and so that point was settled.\r\n\r\nBy that morning\xe2\x80\x99s post I despatched a few hasty lines to Frederick,\r\nbeseeching him to prepare my asylum for my immediate reception: for I\r\nshould probably come to claim it within a day after the receipt of that\r\nnote: and telling him, in few words, the cause of my sudden resolution.\r\nI then wrote three letters of adieu: the first to Esther Hargrave, in\r\nwhich I told her that I found it impossible to stay any longer at\r\nGrassdale, or to leave my son under his father\xe2\x80\x99s protection; and, as it\r\nwas of the last importance that our future abode should be unknown to\r\nhim and his acquaintance, I should disclose it to no one but my\r\nbrother, through the medium of whom I hoped still to correspond with my\r\nfriends. I then gave her his address, exhorted her to write frequently,\r\nreiterated some of my former admonitions regarding her own concerns,\r\nand bade her a fond farewell.\r\n\r\nThe second was to Milicent; much to the same effect, but a little more\r\nconfidential, as befitted our longer intimacy, and her greater\r\nexperience and better acquaintance with my circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe third was to my aunt: a much more difficult and painful\r\nundertaking, and therefore I had left it to the last; but I must give\r\nher some explanation of that extraordinary step I had taken: and that\r\nquickly, for she and my uncle would no doubt hear of it within a day or\r\ntwo after my disappearance, as it was probable that Mr. Huntingdon\r\nwould speedily apply to them to know what was become of me. At last,\r\nhowever, I told her I was sensible of my error: I did not complain of\r\nits punishment, and I was sorry to trouble my friends with its\r\nconsequences; but in duty to my son I must submit no longer; it was\r\nabsolutely necessary that he should be delivered from his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncorrupting influence. I should not disclose my place of refuge even to\r\nher, in order that she and my uncle might be able, with truth, to deny\r\nall knowledge concerning it; but any communications addressed to me\r\nunder cover to my brother would be certain to reach me. I hoped she and\r\nmy uncle would pardon the step I had taken, for if they knew all, I was\r\nsure they would not blame me; and I trusted they would not afflict\r\nthemselves on my account, for if I could only reach my retreat in\r\nsafety and keep it unmolested, I should be very happy, but for the\r\nthoughts of them; and should be quite contented to spend my life in\r\nobscurity, devoting myself to the training up of my child, and teaching\r\nhim to avoid the errors of both his parents.\r\n\r\nThese things were done yesterday: I have given two whole days to the\r\npreparation for our departure, that Frederick may have more time to\r\nprepare the rooms, and Rachel to pack up the things: for the latter\r\ntask must be done with the utmost caution and secrecy, and there is no\r\none but me to assist her. I can help to get the articles together, but\r\nI do not understand the art of stowing them into the boxes, so as to\r\ntake up the smallest possible space; and there are her own things to\r\ndo, as well as mine and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s. I can ill afford to leave anything\r\nbehind, since I have no money, except a few guineas in my purse; and\r\nbesides, as Rachel observed, whatever I left would most likely become\r\nthe property of Miss Myers, and I should not relish that.\r\n\r\nBut what trouble I have had throughout these two days, struggling to\r\nappear calm and collected, to meet him and her as usual, when I was\r\nobliged to meet them, and forcing myself to leave my little Arthur in\r\nher hands for hours together! But I trust these trials are over now: I\r\nhave laid him in my bed for better security, and never more, I trust,\r\nshall his innocent lips be defiled by their contaminating kisses, or\r\nhis young ears polluted by their words. But shall we escape in safety?\r\nOh, that the morning were come, and we were on our way at least! This\r\nevening, when I had given Rachel all the assistance I could, and had\r\nnothing left me but to wait, and wish and tremble, I became so greatly\r\nagitated that I knew not what to do. I went down to dinner, but I could\r\nnot force myself to eat. Mr. Huntingdon remarked the circumstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to do with you _now?_\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when the removal of the second\r\ncourse gave him time to look about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not well,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI think I must lie down a little; you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t miss me much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least: if you leave your chair, it\xe2\x80\x99ll do just as well\xe2\x80\x94better,\r\na trifle,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, as I left the room, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I can fancy somebody\r\nelse fills it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody else _may_ fill it to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, but did not say.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the last of _you_, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered, as I closed\r\nthe door upon him.\r\n\r\nRachel urged me to seek repose at once, to recruit my strength for\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s journey, as we must be gone before the dawn; but in my\r\npresent state of nervous excitement that was entirely out of the\r\nquestion. It was equally out of the question to sit, or wander about my\r\nroom, counting the hours and the minutes between me and the appointed\r\ntime of action, straining my ears and trembling at every sound, lest\r\nsomeone should discover and betray us after all. I took up a book and\r\ntried to read: my eyes wandered over the pages, but it was impossible\r\nto bind my thoughts to their contents. Why not have recourse to the old\r\nexpedient, and add this last event to my chronicle? I opened its pages\r\nonce more, and wrote the above account\xe2\x80\x94with difficulty, at first, but\r\ngradually my mind became more calm and steady. Thus several hours have\r\npassed away: the time is drawing near; and now my eyes feel heavy and\r\nmy frame exhausted. I will commend my cause to God, and then lie down\r\nand gain an hour or two of sleep; and _then!_\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLittle Arthur sleeps soundly. All the house is still: there can be no\r\none watching. The boxes were all corded by Benson, and quietly conveyed\r\ndown the back stairs after dusk, and sent away in a cart to the M\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\ncoach-office. The name upon the cards was Mrs. Graham, which\r\nappellation I mean henceforth to adopt. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s maiden name was\r\nGraham, and therefore I fancy I have some claim to it, and prefer it to\r\nany other, except my own, which I dare not resume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 24th.\xe2\x80\x94Thank Heaven, I am free and safe at last. Early we rose,\r\nswiftly and quietly dressed, slowly and stealthily descended to the\r\nhall, where Benson stood ready with a light, to open the door and\r\nfasten it after us. We were obliged to let one man into our secret on\r\naccount of the boxes, &c. All the servants were but too well acquainted\r\nwith their master\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and either Benson or John would have been\r\nwilling to serve me; but as the former was more staid and elderly, and\r\na crony of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s besides, I of course directed her to make choice of\r\nhim as her assistant and confidant on the occasion, as far as necessity\r\ndemanded, I only hope he may not be brought into trouble thereby, and\r\nonly wish I could reward him for the perilous service he was so ready\r\nto undertake. I slipped two guineas into his hand, by way of\r\nremembrance, as he stood in the doorway, holding the candle to light\r\nour departure, with a tear in his honest grey eye, and a host of good\r\nwishes depicted on his solemn countenance. Alas! I could offer no more:\r\nI had barely sufficient remaining for the probable expenses of the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nWhat trembling joy it was when the little wicket closed behind us, as\r\nwe issued from the park! Then, for one moment, I paused, to inhale one\r\ndraught of that cool, bracing air, and venture one look back upon the\r\nhouse. All was dark and still: no light glimmered in the windows, no\r\nwreath of smoke obscured the stars that sparkled above it in the frosty\r\nsky. As I bade farewell for ever to that place, the scene of so much\r\nguilt and misery, I felt glad that I had not left it before, for now\r\nthere was no doubt about the propriety of such a step\xe2\x80\x94no shadow of\r\nremorse for him I left behind. There was nothing to disturb my joy but\r\nthe fear of detection; and every step removed us further from the\r\nchance of that.\r\n\r\nWe had left Grassdale many miles behind us before the round red sun\r\narose to welcome our deliverance; and if any inhabitant of its vicinity\r\nhad chanced to see us then, as we bowled along on the top of the coach,\r\nI scarcely think they would have suspected our identity. As I intend to\r\nbe taken for a widow, I thought it advisable to enter my new abode in\r\nmourning: I was, therefore, attired in a plain black silk dress and\r\nmantle, a black veil (which I kept carefully over my face for the first\r\ntwenty or thirty miles of the journey), and a black silk bonnet, which\r\nI had been constrained to borrow of Rachel, for want of such an article\r\nmyself. It was not in the newest fashion, of course; but none the worse\r\nfor that, under present circumstances. Arthur was clad in his plainest\r\nclothes, and wrapped in a coarse woollen shawl; and Rachel was muffled\r\nin a grey cloak and hood that had seen better days, and gave her more\r\nthe appearance of an ordinary though decent old woman, than of a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid.\r\n\r\nOh, what delight it was to be thus seated aloft, rumbling along the\r\nbroad, sunshiny road, with the fresh morning breeze in my face,\r\nsurrounded by an unknown country, all smiling\xe2\x80\x94cheerfully, gloriously\r\nsmiling in the yellow lustre of those early beams; with my darling\r\nchild in my arms, almost as happy as myself, and my faithful friend\r\nbeside me: a prison and despair behind me, receding further, further\r\nback at every clatter of the horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet; and liberty and hope before!\r\nI could hardly refrain from praising God aloud for my deliverance, or\r\nastonishing my fellow-passengers by some surprising outburst of\r\nhilarity.\r\n\r\nBut the journey was a very long one, and we were all weary enough\r\nbefore the close of it. It was far into the night when we reached the\r\ntown of L\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and still we were seven miles from our journey\xe2\x80\x99s end; and\r\nthere was no more coaching, nor any conveyance to be had, except a\r\ncommon cart, and that with the greatest difficulty, for half the town\r\nwas in bed. And a dreary ride we had of it, that last stage of the\r\njourney, cold and weary as we were; sitting on our boxes, with nothing\r\nto cling to, nothing to lean against, slowly dragged and cruelly shaken\r\nover the rough, hilly roads. But Arthur was asleep in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s lap, and\r\nbetween us we managed pretty well to shield him from the cold night\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAt last we began to ascend a terribly steep and stony lane, which, in\r\nspite of the darkness, Rachel said she remembered well: she had often\r\nwalked there with me in her arms, and little thought to come again so\r\nmany years after, under such circumstances as the present. Arthur being\r\nnow awakened by the jolting and the stoppages, we all got out and\r\nwalked. We had not far to go; but what if Frederick should not have\r\nreceived my letter? or if he should not have had time to prepare the\r\nrooms for our reception, and we should find them all dark, damp, and\r\ncomfortless, destitute of food, fire, and furniture, after all our\r\ntoil?\r\n\r\nAt length the grim, dark pile appeared before us. The lane conducted us\r\nround by the back way. We entered the desolate court, and in breathless\r\nanxiety surveyed the ruinous mass. Was it all blackness and desolation?\r\nNo; one faint red glimmer cheered us from a window where the lattice\r\nwas in good repair. The door was fastened, but after due knocking and\r\nwaiting, and some parleying with a voice from an upper window, we were\r\nadmitted by an old woman who had been commissioned to air and keep the\r\nhouse till our arrival, into a tolerably snug little apartment,\r\nformerly the scullery of the mansion, which Frederick had now fitted up\r\nas a kitchen. Here she procured us a light, roused the fire to a\r\ncheerful blaze, and soon prepared a simple repast for our refreshment;\r\nwhile we disencumbered ourselves of our travelling-gear, and took a\r\nhasty survey of our new abode. Besides the kitchen, there were two\r\nbedrooms, a good-sized parlour, and another smaller one, which I\r\ndestined for my studio, all well aired and seemingly in good repair,\r\nbut only partly furnished with a few old articles, chiefly of ponderous\r\nblack oak, the veritable ones that had been there before, and which had\r\nbeen kept as antiquarian relics in my brother\xe2\x80\x99s present residence, and\r\nnow, in all haste, transported back again.\r\n\r\nThe old woman brought my supper and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s into the parlour, and told\r\nme, with all due formality, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe master desired his compliments to\r\nMrs. Graham, and he had prepared the rooms as well as he could upon so\r\nshort a notice; but he would do himself the pleasure of calling upon\r\nher to-morrow, to receive her further commands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was glad to ascend the stern-looking stone staircase, and lie down in\r\nthe gloomy, old-fashioned bed, beside my little Arthur. He was asleep\r\nin a minute; but, weary as I was, my excited feelings and restless\r\ncogitations kept me awake till dawn began to struggle with the\r\ndarkness; but sleep was sweet and refreshing when it came, and the\r\nwaking was delightful beyond expression. It was little Arthur that\r\nroused me, with his gentle kisses. He was here, then, safely clasped in\r\nmy arms, and many leagues away from his unworthy father! Broad daylight\r\nillumined the apartment, for the sun was high in heaven, though\r\nobscured by rolling masses of autumnal vapour.\r\n\r\nThe scene, indeed, was not remarkably cheerful in itself, either within\r\nor without. The large bare room, with its grim old furniture, the\r\nnarrow, latticed windows, revealing the dull, grey sky above and the\r\ndesolate wilderness below, where the dark stone walls and iron gate,\r\nthe rank growth of grass and weeds, and the hardy evergreens of\r\npreternatural forms, alone remained to tell that there had been once a\r\ngarden,\xe2\x80\x94and the bleak and barren fields beyond might have struck me as\r\ngloomy enough at another time; but now, each separate object seemed to\r\necho back my own exhilarating sense of hope and freedom: indefinite\r\ndreams of the far past and bright anticipations of the future seemed to\r\ngreet me at every turn. I should rejoice with more security, to be\r\nsure, had the broad sea rolled between my present and my former homes;\r\nbut surely in this lonely spot I might remain unknown; and then I had\r\nmy brother here to cheer my solitude with his occasional visits.\r\n\r\nHe came that morning; and I have had several interviews with him since;\r\nbut he is obliged to be very cautious when and how he comes; not even\r\nhis servants or his best friends must know of his visits to\r\nWildfell\xe2\x80\x94except on such occasions as a landlord might be expected to\r\ncall upon a stranger tenant\xe2\x80\x94lest suspicion should be excited against\r\nme, whether of the truth or of some slanderous falsehood.\r\n\r\nI have now been here nearly a fortnight, and, but for one disturbing\r\ncare, the haunting dread of discovery, I am comfortably settled in my\r\nnew home: Frederick has supplied me with all requisite furniture and\r\npainting materials: Rachel has sold most of my clothes for me, in a\r\ndistant town, and procured me a wardrobe more suitable to my present\r\nposition: I have a second-hand piano, and a tolerably well-stocked\r\nbookcase in my parlour; and my other room has assumed quite a\r\nprofessional, business-like appearance already. I am working hard to\r\nrepay my brother for all his expenses on my account; not that there is\r\nthe slightest necessity for anything of the kind, but it pleases me to\r\ndo so: I shall have so much more pleasure in my labour, my earnings, my\r\nfrugal fare, and household economy, when I know that I am paying my way\r\nhonestly, and that what little I possess is legitimately all my own;\r\nand that no one suffers for my folly\xe2\x80\x94in a pecuniary way at least. I\r\nshall make him take the last penny I owe him, if I can possibly effect\r\nit without offending him too deeply. I have a few pictures already\r\ndone, for I told Rachel to pack up all I had; and she executed her\r\ncommission but too well\xe2\x80\x94for among the rest, she put up a portrait of\r\nMr. Huntingdon that I had painted in the first year of my marriage. It\r\nstruck me with dismay, at the moment, when I took it from the box and\r\nbeheld those eyes fixed upon me in their mocking mirth, as if exulting\r\nstill in his power to control my fate, and deriding my efforts to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nHow widely different had been my feelings in painting that portrait to\r\nwhat they now were in looking upon it! How I had studied and toiled to\r\nproduce something, as I thought, worthy of the original! what mingled\r\npleasure and dissatisfaction I had had in the result of my\r\nlabours!\xe2\x80\x94pleasure for the likeness I had caught; dissatisfaction,\r\nbecause I had not made it handsome enough. Now, I see no beauty in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94nothing pleasing in any part of its expression; and yet it is far\r\nhandsomer and far more agreeable\xe2\x80\x94far less repulsive I should rather\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94than he is now: for these six years have wrought almost as great a\r\nchange upon himself as on my feelings regarding him. The frame,\r\nhowever, is handsome enough; it will serve for another painting. The\r\npicture itself I have not destroyed, as I had first intended; I have\r\nput it aside; not, I think, from any lurking tenderness for the memory\r\nof past affection, nor yet to remind me of my former folly, but chiefly\r\nthat I may compare my son\xe2\x80\x99s features and countenance with this, as he\r\ngrows up, and thus be enabled to judge how much or how little he\r\nresembles his father\xe2\x80\x94if I may be allowed to keep him with me still, and\r\nnever to behold that father\xe2\x80\x99s face again\xe2\x80\x94a blessing I hardly dare\r\nreckon upon.\r\n\r\nIt seems Mr. Huntingdon is making every exertion to discover the place\r\nof my retreat. He has been in person to Staningley, seeking redress for\r\nhis grievances\xe2\x80\x94expecting to hear of his victims, if not to find them\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94and has told so many lies, and with such unblushing coolness,\r\nthat my uncle more than half believes him, and strongly advocates my\r\ngoing back to him and being friends again. But my aunt knows better:\r\nshe is too cool and cautious, and too well acquainted with both my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s character and my own to be imposed upon by any specious\r\nfalsehoods the former could invent. But he does not _want_ me back; he\r\nwants my child; and gives my friends to understand that if I prefer\r\nliving apart from him, he will indulge the whim and let me do so\r\nunmolested, and even settle a reasonable allowance on me, provided I\r\nwill immediately deliver up his son. But heaven help me! I am not going\r\nto sell my child for gold, though it were to save both him and me from\r\nstarving: it would be better that he should die with me than that he\r\nshould live with his father.\r\n\r\nFrederick showed me a letter he had received from that gentleman, full\r\nof cool impudence such as would astonish any one who did not know him,\r\nbut such as, I am convinced, none would know better how to answer than\r\nmy brother. He gave me no account of his reply, except to tell me that\r\nhe had not acknowledged his acquaintance with my place of refuge, but\r\nrather left it to be inferred that it was quite unknown to him, by\r\nsaying it was useless to apply to him, or any other of my relations,\r\nfor information on the subject, as it appeared I had been driven to\r\nsuch extremity that I had concealed my retreat even from my best\r\nfriends; but that if he _had_ known it, or should at any time be made\r\naware of it, most certainly Mr. Huntingdon would be the last person to\r\nwhom he should communicate the intelligence; and that he need not\r\ntrouble himself to bargain for the child, for he (Frederick) fancied he\r\nknew enough of his sister to enable him to declare, that wherever she\r\nmight be, or however situated, no consideration would induce her to\r\ndeliver him up.\r\n\r\n30th.\xe2\x80\x94Alas! my kind neighbours will not let me alone. By some means\r\nthey have ferreted me out, and I have had to sustain visits from three\r\ndifferent families, all more or less bent upon discovering who and what\r\nI am, whence I came, and why I have chosen such a home as this. Their\r\nsociety is unnecessary to me, to say the least, and their curiosity\r\nannoys and alarms me: if I gratify it, it may lead to the ruin of my\r\nson, and if I am too mysterious it will only excite their suspicions,\r\ninvite conjecture, and rouse them to greater exertions\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps be\r\nthe means of spreading my fame from parish to parish, till it reach the\r\nears of some one who will carry it to the Lord of Grassdale Manor.\r\n\r\nI shall be expected to return their calls, but if, upon inquiry, I find\r\nthat any of them live too far away for Arthur to accompany me, they\r\nmust expect in vain for a while, for I cannot bear to leave him, unless\r\nit be to go to church, and I have not attempted _that_ yet: for\xe2\x80\x94it may\r\nbe foolish weakness, but I am under such constant dread of his being\r\nsnatched away, that I am never easy when he is not by my side; and I\r\nfear these nervous terrors would so entirely disturb my devotions, that\r\nI should obtain no benefit from the attendance. I mean, however, to\r\nmake the experiment next Sunday, and oblige myself to leave him in\r\ncharge of Rachel for a few hours. It will be a hard task, but surely no\r\nimprudence; and the vicar has been to scold me for my neglect of the\r\nordinances of religion. I had no sufficient excuse to offer, and I\r\npromised, if all were well, he should see me in my pew next Sunday; for\r\nI do not wish to be set down as an infidel; and, besides, I know I\r\nshould derive great comfort and benefit from an occasional attendance\r\nat public worship, if I could only have faith and fortitude to compose\r\nmy thoughts in conformity with the solemn occasion, and forbid them to\r\nbe for ever dwelling on my absent child, and on the dreadful\r\npossibility of finding him gone when I return; and surely God in His\r\nmercy will preserve me from so severe a trial: for my child\xe2\x80\x99s own sake,\r\nif not for mine, He will not suffer him to be torn away.\r\n\r\nNovember 3rd.\xe2\x80\x94I have made some further acquaintance with my neighbours.\r\nThe fine gentleman and beau of the parish and its vicinity (in his own\r\nestimation, at least) is a young . . . .\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nHere it ended. The rest was torn away. How cruel, just when she was\r\ngoing to mention me! for I could not doubt it _was_ your humble servant\r\nshe was about to mention, though not very favourably, of course. I\r\ncould tell that, as well by those few words as by the recollection of\r\nher whole aspect and demeanour towards me in the commencement of our\r\nacquaintance. Well! I could readily forgive her prejudice against me,\r\nand her hard thoughts of our sex in general, when I saw to what\r\nbrilliant specimens her experience had been limited.\r\n\r\nRespecting me, however, she had long since seen her error, and perhaps\r\nfallen into another in the opposite extreme: for if, at first, her\r\nopinion of me had been lower than I deserved, I was convinced that now\r\nmy deserts were lower than her opinion; and if the former part of this\r\ncontinuation had been torn away to avoid wounding my feelings, perhaps\r\nthe latter portion had been removed for fear of ministering too much to\r\nmy self-conceit. At any rate, I would have given much to have seen it\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94to have witnessed the gradual change, and watched the progress of\r\nher esteem and friendship for me, and whatever warmer feeling she might\r\nhave; to have seen how much of love there was in her regard, and how it\r\nhad grown upon her in spite of her virtuous resolutions and strenuous\r\nexertions to\xe2\x80\x94but no, I had no right to see it: all this was too sacred\r\nfor any eyes but her own, and she had done well to keep it from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, Halford, what do you think of all this? and while you read it,\r\ndid you ever picture to yourself what my feelings would probably be\r\nduring its perusal? Most likely not; but I am not going to descant upon\r\nthem now: I will only make this acknowledgment, little honourable as it\r\nmay be to human nature, and especially to myself,\xe2\x80\x94that the former half\r\nof the narrative was, to me, more painful than the latter, not that I\r\nwas at all insensible to Mrs. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s wrongs or unmoved by her\r\nsufferings, but, I must confess, I felt a kind of selfish gratification\r\nin watching her husband\xe2\x80\x99s gradual decline in her good graces, and\r\nseeing how completely he extinguished all her affection at last. The\r\neffect of the whole, however, in spite of all my sympathy for her, and\r\nmy fury against him, was to relieve my mind of an intolerable burden,\r\nand fill my heart with joy, as if some friend had roused me from a\r\ndreadful nightmare.\r\n\r\nIt was now near eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, for my candle had expired\r\nin the midst of my perusal, leaving me no alternative but to get\r\nanother, at the expense of alarming the house, or to go to bed, and\r\nwait the return of daylight. On my mother\xe2\x80\x99s account, I chose the\r\nlatter; but how _willingly_ I sought my pillow, and how much sleep it\r\nbrought me, I leave you to imagine.\r\n\r\nAt the first appearance of dawn, I rose, and brought the manuscript to\r\nthe window, but it was impossible to read it yet. I devoted half an\r\nhour to dressing, and then returned to it again. Now, with a little\r\ndifficulty, I could manage; and with intense and eager interest, I\r\ndevoured the remainder of its contents. When it was ended, and my\r\ntransient regret at its abrupt conclusion was over, I opened the window\r\nand put out my head to catch the cooling breeze, and imbibe deep\r\ndraughts of the pure morning air. A splendid morning it was; the\r\nhalf-frozen dew lay thick on the grass, the swallows were twittering\r\nround me, the rooks cawing, and cows lowing in the distance; and early\r\nfrost and summer sunshine mingled their sweetness in the air. But I did\r\nnot think of that: a confusion of countless thoughts and varied\r\nemotions crowded upon me while I gazed abstractedly on the lovely face\r\nof nature. Soon, however, this chaos of thoughts and passions cleared\r\naway, giving place to two distinct emotions: joy unspeakable that my\r\nadored Helen was all I wished to think her\xe2\x80\x94that through the noisome\r\nvapours of the world\xe2\x80\x99s aspersions and my own fancied convictions, her\r\ncharacter shone bright, and clear, and stainless as that sun I could\r\nnot bear to look on; and shame and deep remorse for my own conduct.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast I hurried over to Wildfell Hall. Rachel had\r\nrisen many degrees in my estimation since yesterday. I was ready to\r\ngreet her quite as an old friend; but every kindly impulse was checked\r\nby the look of cold distrust she cast upon me on opening the door. The\r\nold virgin had constituted herself the guardian of her lady\xe2\x80\x99s honour, I\r\nsuppose, and doubtless she saw in me another Mr. Hargrave, only the\r\nmore dangerous in being more esteemed and trusted by her mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis can\xe2\x80\x99t see any one to-day, sir\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s poorly,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in\r\nanswer to my inquiry for Mrs. Graham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must see her, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, placing my hand on the door to\r\nprevent its being shut against me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir, you can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, settling her countenance in\r\nstill more iron frigidity than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to announce me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no manner of use, Mr. Markham; she\xe2\x80\x99s poorly, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust in time to prevent me from committing the impropriety of taking\r\nthe citadel by storm, and pushing forward unannounced, an inner door\r\nopened, and little Arthur appeared with his frolicsome playfellow, the\r\ndog. He seized my hand between both his, and smilingly drew me forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma says you\xe2\x80\x99re to come in, Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am to go\r\nout and play with Rover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel retired with a sigh, and I stepped into the parlour and shut the\r\ndoor. There, before the fire-place, stood the tall, graceful figure,\r\nwasted with many sorrows. I cast the manuscript on the table, and\r\nlooked in her face. Anxious and pale, it was turned towards me; her\r\nclear, dark eyes were fixed on mine with a gaze so intensely earnest\r\nthat they bound me like a spell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you looked it over?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. The spell was broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve read it through,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, advancing into the room,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I want to\r\nknow if you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me\xe2\x80\x94if you _can_ forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but her eyes glistened, and a faint red mantled on\r\nher lip and cheek. As I approached, she abruptly turned away, and went\r\nto the window. It was not in anger, I was well assured, but only to\r\nconceal or control her emotion. I therefore ventured to follow and\r\nstand beside her there,\xe2\x80\x94but not to speak. She gave me her hand, without\r\nturning her head, and murmured in a voice she strove in vain to\r\nsteady,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan _you_ forgive _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might be deemed a breach of trust, I thought, to convey that lily\r\nhand to my lips, so I only gently pressed it between my own, and\r\nsmilingly replied,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly can. You should have told me this before.\r\nIt shows a want of confidence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, eagerly interrupting me; \xe2\x80\x9cit was not that. It was\r\nno want of confidence in you; but if I had told you anything of my\r\nhistory, I must have told you all, in order to excuse my conduct; and I\r\nmight well shrink from such a disclosure, till necessity obliged me to\r\nmake it. But you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x94I have done very, very wrong, I know; but,\r\nas usual, I have reaped the bitter fruits of my own error,\xe2\x80\x94and must\r\nreap them to the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBitter, indeed, was the tone of anguish, repressed by resolute\r\nfirmness, in which this was spoken. Now, I raised her hand to my lips,\r\nand fervently kissed it again and again; for tears prevented any other\r\nreply. She suffered these wild caresses without resistance or\r\nresentment; then, suddenly turning from me, she paced twice or thrice\r\nthrough the room. I knew by the contraction of her brow, the tight\r\ncompression of her lips, and wringing of her hands, that meantime a\r\nviolent conflict between reason and passion was silently passing\r\nwithin. At length she paused before the empty fire-place, and turning\r\nto me, said calmly\xe2\x80\x94if that might be called calmness which was so\r\nevidently the result of a violent effort,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Gilbert, you must leave me\xe2\x80\x94not this moment, but soon\xe2\x80\x94and you must\r\n_never come again_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever again, Helen? just when I love you more than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that very reason, if it be so, we should not meet again. I thought\r\n_this_ interview was necessary\xe2\x80\x94at least, I persuaded myself it was\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94that we might severally ask and receive each other\xe2\x80\x99s pardon for the\r\npast; but there can be no excuse for another. I shall leave this place,\r\nas soon as I have means to seek another asylum; but our intercourse\r\nmust end here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnd here!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed I; and approaching the high, carved chimney-piece, I\r\nleant my hand against its heavy mouldings, and dropped my forehead upon\r\nit in silent, sullen despondency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not come again,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she. There was a slight tremor in\r\nher voice, but I thought her whole manner was provokingly composed,\r\nconsidering the dreadful sentence she pronounced. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know why I\r\ntell you so,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed; \xe2\x80\x9cand you must see that it is better to part\r\nat once:\xe2\x80\x94if it be hard to say adieu for ever, you ought to help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe paused. I did not answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you promise not to come?\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t, and if you do come here again, you will drive me away before I\r\nknow where to find another place of refuge\xe2\x80\x94or how to seek it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, turning impatiently towards her, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot discuss the\r\nmatter of eternal separation calmly and dispassionately as you can do.\r\nIt is no question of mere expedience with _me;_ it is a question of\r\nlife and death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent. Her pale lips quivered, and her fingers trembled with\r\nagitation, as she nervously entwined them in the hair-chain to which\r\nwas appended her small gold watch\xe2\x80\x94the only thing of value she had\r\npermitted herself to keep. I had said an unjust and cruel thing; but I\r\nmust needs follow it up with something worse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d I began in a soft, low tone, not daring to raise my eyes\r\nto her face, \xe2\x80\x9cthat man is not your husband: in the sight of heaven he\r\nhas forfeited all claim to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She seized my arm with a grasp of\r\nstartling energy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Gilbert, don\xe2\x80\x99t!_\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, in a tone that would have pierced a\r\nheart of adamant. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ attempt these arguments!\r\nNo _fiend_ could torture me like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, gently laying my hand on hers; almost as\r\nmuch alarmed at her vehemence as ashamed of my own misconduct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of acting like a true friend,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, breaking from\r\nme, and throwing herself into the old arm-chair, \xe2\x80\x9cand helping me with\r\nall your might\xe2\x80\x94or rather taking your own part in the struggle of right\r\nagainst passion\xe2\x80\x94you leave all the burden to me;\xe2\x80\x94and not satisfied with\r\nthat, you do your utmost to fight against me\xe2\x80\x94when you know that!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npaused, and hid her face in her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded I. \xe2\x80\x9cI will never utter another word on the\r\nsubject. But may we not still meet as friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not do,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, mournfully shaking her head; and then\r\nshe raised her eyes to mine, with a mildly reproachful look that seemed\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know that as well as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what _must_ we do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, passionately. But immediately I\r\nadded in a quieter tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you desire; only _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ say\r\nthat this meeting is to be our last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that every time we meet the thoughts of\r\nthe final parting will become more painful? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you _feel_ that every\r\ninterview makes us dearer to each other than the last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe utterance of this last question was hurried and low, and the\r\ndowncast eyes and burning blush too plainly showed that _she_, at\r\nleast, had felt it. It was scarcely prudent to make such an admission,\r\nor to add\xe2\x80\x94as she presently did\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have power to bid you go, now:\r\nanother time it might be different,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but I was not base enough to\r\nattempt to take advantage of her candour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we may write,\xe2\x80\x9d I timidly suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will not deny me that\r\nconsolation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can hear of each other through my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother!\xe2\x80\x9d A pang of remorse and shame shot through me. She had\r\nnot heard of the injury he had sustained at my hands; and I had not the\r\ncourage to tell her. \xe2\x80\x9cYour brother will not help us,\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9che would\r\nhave all communion between us to be entirely at an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he would be right, I suppose. As a friend of both, he would wish\r\nus both well; and every friend would tell us it was our interest, as\r\nwell as our duty, to forget each other, though we might not see it\r\nourselves. But don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, Gilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, smiling sadly at\r\nmy manifest discomposure; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is little chance of my forgetting you.\r\nBut I did not mean that Frederick should be the means of transmitting\r\nmessages between us\xe2\x80\x94only that each might know, through him, of the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s welfare;\xe2\x80\x94and more than this ought not to be: for you are young,\r\nGilbert, and you ought to marry\xe2\x80\x94and will some time, though you may\r\nthink it impossible now: and though I hardly can say I wish you to\r\nforget me, I know it is right that you should, both for your own\r\nhappiness, and that of your future wife;\xe2\x80\x94and therefore I must and will\r\nwish it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added resolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are young too, Helen,\xe2\x80\x9d I boldly replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand when that\r\nprofligate scoundrel has run through his career, you will give your\r\nhand to me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait till then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she would not leave me this support. Independently of the moral\r\nevil of basing our hopes upon the death of another, who, if unfit for\r\nthis world, was at least no less so for the next, and whose\r\namelioration would thus become our bane and his greatest transgression\r\nour greatest benefit,\xe2\x80\x94she maintained it to be madness: many men of Mr.\r\nHuntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s habits had lived to a ripe though miserable old age. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nif I,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cam young in years, I am old in sorrow; but even if\r\ntrouble should fail to kill me before vice destroys him, think, if he\r\nreached but fifty years or so, would you wait twenty or fifteen\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nvague uncertainty and suspense\xe2\x80\x94through all the prime of youth and\r\nmanhood\xe2\x80\x94and marry at last a woman faded and worn as I shall be\xe2\x80\x94without\r\never having seen me from this day to that?\xe2\x80\x94You would not,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, interrupting my earnest protestations of unfailing\r\nconstancy,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor if you would, you should not. Trust me, Gilbert; in this\r\nmatter I know better than you. You think me cold and stony-hearted, and\r\nyou may, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t, Helen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind: you might if you would: but I have not spent my\r\nsolitude in utter idleness, and I am not speaking now from the impulse\r\nof the moment, as you do. I have thought of all these matters again and\r\nagain; I have argued these questions with myself, and pondered well our\r\npast, and present, and future career; and, believe me, I have come to\r\nthe right conclusion at last. Trust my words rather than your own\r\nfeelings now, and in a few years you will see that I was right\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nat present I hardly can see it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured with a sigh as she\r\nrested her head on her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t argue against me any more: all\r\nyou can say has been already said by my own heart and refuted by my\r\nreason. It was hard enough to combat those suggestions as they were\r\nwhispered within me; in your mouth they are ten times worse, and if you\r\nknew how much they pain me you would cease at once, I know. If you knew\r\nmy present feelings, you would even try to relieve them at the expense\r\nof your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go\xe2\x80\x94in a minute, if _that_ can relieve you\xe2\x80\x94and NEVER return!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid I, with bitter emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, if we may never meet, and never\r\nhope to meet again, is it a crime to exchange our thoughts by letter?\r\nMay not kindred spirits meet, and mingle in communion, whatever be the\r\nfate and circumstances of their earthly tenements?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may, they may!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, with a momentary burst of glad\r\nenthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought of that too, Gilbert, but I feared to mention\r\nit, because I feared you would not understand my views upon the\r\nsubject. I fear it even now\xe2\x80\x94I fear any kind friend would tell us we are\r\n_both_ deluding ourselves with the idea of keeping up a spiritual\r\nintercourse without hope or prospect of anything further\xe2\x80\x94without\r\nfostering vain regrets and hurtful aspirations, and feeding thoughts\r\nthat should be sternly and pitilessly left to perish of inanition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind our kind friends: if they can part our bodies, it is\r\nenough; in God\xe2\x80\x99s name, let them not sunder our souls!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, in\r\nterror lest she should deem it her duty to deny us this last remaining\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no letters can pass between us here,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout giving\r\nfresh food for scandal; and when I departed, I had intended that my new\r\nabode should be unknown to you as to the rest of the world; not that I\r\nshould doubt your word if you promised not to visit me, but I thought\r\nyou would be more tranquil in your own mind if you knew you could not\r\ndo it, and likely to find less difficulty in abstracting yourself from\r\nme if you could not picture my situation to your mind. But listen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she, smilingly putting up her finger to check my impatient reply:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin six months you shall hear from Frederick precisely where I am; and\r\nif you still retain your wish to write to me, and think you can\r\nmaintain a correspondence all thought, all spirit\xe2\x80\x94such as disembodied\r\nsouls or unimpassioned friends, at least, might hold,\xe2\x80\x94write, and I will\r\nanswer you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix months!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to give your present ardour time to cool, and try the truth and\r\nconstancy of your soul\xe2\x80\x99s love for mine. And now, enough has been said\r\nbetween us. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we part at once?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she, almost wildly,\r\nafter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, as she suddenly rose from her chair, with her\r\nhands resolutely clasped together. I thought it was my duty to go\r\nwithout delay; and I approached and half extended my hand as if to take\r\nleave\xe2\x80\x94she grasped it in silence. But this thought of final separation\r\nwas too intolerable: it seemed to squeeze the blood out of my heart;\r\nand my feet were glued to the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd must we never meet again?\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured, in the anguish of my soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet in heaven. Let us think of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said she in a tone of\r\ndesperate calmness; but her eyes glittered wildly, and her face was\r\ndeadly pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not as we are now,\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help replying. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gives me little\r\nconsolation to think I shall next behold you as a disembodied spirit,\r\nor an altered being, with a frame perfect and glorious, but not like\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x94and a heart, perhaps, entirely estranged from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Gilbert, there is perfect love in heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_So_ perfect, I suppose, that it soars above distinctions, and you\r\nwill have no closer sympathy with me than with any one of the ten\r\nthousand thousand angels and the innumerable multitude of happy spirits\r\nround us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever I am, you will be the same, and, therefore, cannot possibly\r\nregret it; and whatever that change may be we know it must be for the\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I am to be so changed that I shall cease to adore you with my\r\nwhole heart and soul, and love you beyond every other creature, I shall\r\nnot be myself; and though, if ever I win heaven at all, I must, I know,\r\nbe infinitely better and happier than I am now, my earthly nature\r\ncannot rejoice in the anticipation of such beatitude, from which itself\r\nand its chief joy must be excluded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your love _all_ earthly, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I am supposing we shall have no more intimate communion with\r\neach other than with the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so, it will be because we love them more, and not each other less.\r\nIncrease of love brings increase of happiness, when it is mutual, and\r\npure as that will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can _you_, Helen, contemplate with delight this prospect of losing\r\nme in a sea of glory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own I cannot; but we know not that it will be so;\xe2\x80\x94and I do know that\r\nto regret the exchange of earthly pleasures for the joys of heaven, is\r\nas if the grovelling caterpillar should lament that it must one day\r\nquit the nibbled leaf to soar aloft and flutter through the air, roving\r\nat will from flower to flower, sipping sweet honey from their cups, or\r\nbasking in their sunny petals. If these little creatures knew how great\r\na change awaited them, no doubt they would regret it; but would not all\r\nsuch sorrow be misplaced? And if that illustration will not move you,\r\nhere is another:\xe2\x80\x94We are children now; we feel as children, and we\r\nunderstand as children; and when we are told that men and women do not\r\nplay with toys, and that our companions will one day weary of the\r\ntrivial sports and occupations that interest them and us so deeply now,\r\nwe cannot help being saddened at the thoughts of such an alteration,\r\nbecause we cannot conceive that as we grow up our own minds will become\r\nso enlarged and elevated that we ourselves shall then regard as\r\ntrifling those objects and pursuits we now so fondly cherish, and that,\r\nthough our companions will no longer join us in those childish\r\npastimes, they will drink with us at other fountains of delight, and\r\nmingle their souls with ours in higher aims and nobler occupations\r\nbeyond our present comprehension, but not less deeply relished or less\r\ntruly good for that, while yet both we and they remain essentially the\r\nsame individuals as before. But, Gilbert, can you really derive no\r\nconsolation from the thought that we may meet together where there is\r\nno more pain and sorrow, no more striving against sin, and struggling\r\nof the spirit against the flesh; where both will behold the same\r\nglorious truths, and drink exalted and supreme felicity from the same\r\nfountain of light and goodness\xe2\x80\x94that Being whom both will worship with\r\nthe same intensity of holy ardour\xe2\x80\x94and where pure and happy creatures\r\nboth will love with the same divine affection? If you cannot, never\r\nwrite to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, I can! if faith would never fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile this hope is strong within us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will part,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not have the pain of another effort\r\nto dismiss me. I will go at once; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not put my request in words: she understood it instinctively, and\r\n_this_ time she yielded too\xe2\x80\x94or rather, there was nothing so deliberate\r\nas requesting or yielding in the matter: there was a sudden impulse\r\nthat neither could resist. One moment I stood and looked into her face,\r\nthe next I held her to my heart, and we seemed to grow together in a\r\nclose embrace from which no physical or mental force could rend us. A\r\nwhispered \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGo\xe2\x80\x94go!\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said; but while she\r\nspoke she held me so fast that, without violence, I could not have\r\nobeyed her. At length, however, by some heroic effort, we tore\r\nourselves apart, and I rushed from the house.\r\n\r\nI have a confused remembrance of seeing little Arthur running up the\r\ngarden-walk to meet me, and of bolting over the wall to avoid him\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsubsequently running down the steep fields, clearing the stone fences\r\nand hedges as they came in my way, till I got completely out of sight\r\nof the old hall and down to the bottom of the hill; and then of long\r\nhours spent in bitter tears and lamentations, and melancholy musings in\r\nthe lonely valley, with the eternal music in my ears, of the west wind\r\nrushing through the overshadowing trees, and the brook babbling and\r\ngurgling along its stony bed; my eyes, for the most part, vacantly\r\nfixed on the deep, chequered shades restlessly playing over the bright\r\nsunny grass at my feet, where now and then a withered leaf or two would\r\ncome dancing to share the revelry; but my heart was away up the hill in\r\nthat dark room where she was weeping desolate and alone\xe2\x80\x94she whom I was\r\nnot to comfort, not to see again, till years or suffering had overcome\r\nus both, and torn our spirits from their perishing abodes of clay.\r\n\r\nThere was little business done that day, you may be sure. The farm was\r\nabandoned to the labourers, and the labourers were left to their own\r\ndevices. But one duty must be attended to; I had not forgotten my\r\nassault upon Frederick Lawrence; and I must see him to apologise for\r\nthe unhappy deed. I would fain have put it off till the morrow; but\r\nwhat if he should denounce me to his sister in the meantime? No, no! I\r\nmust ask his pardon to-day, and entreat him to be lenient in his\r\naccusation, if the revelation must be made. I deferred it, however,\r\ntill the evening, when my spirits were more composed, and when\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\nwonderful perversity of human nature!\xe2\x80\x94some faint germs of indefinite\r\nhopes were beginning to rise in my mind; not that I intended to cherish\r\nthem, after all that had been said on the subject, but there they must\r\nlie for a while, uncrushed though not encouraged, till I had learnt to\r\nlive without them.\r\n\r\nArrived at Woodford, the young squire\xe2\x80\x99s abode, I found no little\r\ndifficulty in obtaining admission to his presence. The servant that\r\nopened the door told me his master was very ill, and seemed to think it\r\ndoubtful whether he would be able to see me. I was not going to be\r\nbaulked, however. I waited calmly in the hall to be announced, but\r\ninwardly determined to take no denial. The message was such as I\r\nexpected\xe2\x80\x94a polite intimation that Mr. Lawrence could see no one; he was\r\nfeverish, and must not be disturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not disturb him long,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must see him for a\r\nmoment: it is on business of importance that I wish to speak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. And I advanced further into the\r\nhall and followed him nearly to the door of the apartment where his\r\nmaster was\xe2\x80\x94for it seemed he was not in bed. The answer returned was\r\nthat Mr. Lawrence hoped I would be so good as to leave a message or a\r\nnote with the servant, as he could attend to no business at present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may as well see me as you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and, stepping past the\r\nastonished footman, I boldly rapped at the door, entered, and closed it\r\nbehind me. The room was spacious and handsomely furnished\xe2\x80\x94very\r\ncomfortably, too, for a bachelor. A clear, red fire was burning in the\r\npolished grate: a superannuated greyhound, given up to idleness and\r\ngood living, lay basking before it on the thick, soft rug, on one\r\ncorner of which, beside the sofa, sat a smart young springer, looking\r\nwistfully up in its master\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94perhaps asking permission to share\r\nhis couch, or, it might be, only soliciting a caress from his hand or a\r\nkind word from his lips. The invalid himself looked very interesting as\r\nhe lay reclining there, in his elegant dressing-gown, with a silk\r\nhandkerchief bound across his temples. His usually pale face was\r\nflushed and feverish; his eyes were half closed, until he became\r\nsensible of my presence\xe2\x80\x94and then he opened them wide enough: one hand\r\nwas thrown listlessly over the back of the sofa, and held a small\r\nvolume, with which, apparently, he had been vainly attempting to\r\nbeguile the weary hours. He dropped it, however, in his start of\r\nindignant surprise as I advanced into the room and stood before him on\r\nthe rug. He raised himself on his pillows, and gazed upon me with equal\r\ndegrees of nervous horror, anger, and amazement depicted on his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Markham, I scarcely expected this!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and the blood left\r\nhis cheek as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d answered I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut be quiet a minute, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what I came for.\xe2\x80\x9d Unthinkingly, I advanced a step or two nearer. He\r\nwinced at my approach, with an expression of aversion and instinctive\r\nphysical fear anything but conciliatory to my feelings. I stepped back,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake your story a short one,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting his hand on the small\r\nsilver bell that stood on the table beside him, \xe2\x80\x9cor I shall be obliged\r\nto call for assistance. I am in no state to bear your brutalities now,\r\nor your presence either.\xe2\x80\x9d And in truth the moisture started from his\r\npores and stood on his pale forehead like dew.\r\n\r\nSuch a reception was hardly calculated to diminish the difficulties of\r\nmy unenviable task. It must be performed however, in some fashion; and\r\nso I plunged into it at once, and floundered through it as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, Lawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not acted quite correctly\r\ntowards you of late\xe2\x80\x94especially on this last occasion; and I\xe2\x80\x99m come\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94in short, to express my regret for what has been done, and to beg\r\nyour pardon. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to grant it,\xe2\x80\x9d I added hastily, not\r\nliking the aspect of his face, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no matter; only _I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ done _my_\r\nduty\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easily done,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, with a faint smile bordering on a\r\nsneer: \xe2\x80\x9cto abuse your friend and knock him on the head without any\r\nassignable cause, and then tell him the deed was not quite correct, but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s no matter whether he pardons it or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to tell you that it was in consequence of a\r\nmistake,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94muttered I. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have made a very handsome apology, but\r\nyou provoked me so confoundedly with your\xe2\x80\x94. Well, I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nfault. The fact is, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that you were Mrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s brother,\r\nand I saw and heard some things respecting your conduct towards her\r\nwhich were calculated to awaken unpleasant suspicions, that, allow me\r\nto say, a little candour and confidence on your part might have\r\nremoved; and, at last, I chanced to overhear a part of a conversation\r\nbetween you and her that made me think I had a right to hate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how came you to know that I was her brother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, in some\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me herself. She told me all. _She_ knew I might be trusted.\r\nBut you needn\xe2\x80\x99t disturb yourself about _that_, Mr. Lawrence, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen the last of her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last! Is she gone, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but she has bid adieu to me, and I have promised never to go near\r\nthat house again while she inhabits it.\xe2\x80\x9d I could have groaned aloud at\r\nthe bitter thoughts awakened by this turn in the discourse. But I only\r\nclenched my hands and stamped my foot upon the rug. My companion,\r\nhowever, was evidently relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a tone of unqualified approbation,\r\nwhile his face brightened into almost a sunny expression. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as for\r\nthe mistake, I am sorry for both our sakes that it should have\r\noccurred. Perhaps you can forgive my want of candour, and remember, as\r\nsome partial mitigation of the offence, how little encouragement to\r\nfriendly confidence you have given me of late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94I remember it all: nobody can blame me more than I blame\r\nmyself in my own heart; at any rate, nobody can regret more sincerely\r\nthan I do the result of my _brutality_, as you rightly term it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, faintly smiling; \xe2\x80\x9clet us forget all\r\nunpleasant words on both sides, as well as deeds, and consign to\r\noblivion everything that we have cause to regret. Have you any\r\nobjection to take my hand, or you\xe2\x80\x99d rather not?\xe2\x80\x9d It trembled through\r\nweakness as he held it out, and dropped before I had time to catch it\r\nand give it a hearty squeeze, which he had not the strength to return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dry and burning your hand is, Lawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are really\r\nill, and I have made you worse by all this talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is nothing; only a cold got by the rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy doing, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. But tell me, did you mention this affair to my\r\nsister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo confess the truth, I had not the courage to do so; but when you\r\ntell her, will you just say that I deeply regret it, and\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never fear! I shall say nothing against you, as long as you keep\r\nyour good resolution of remaining aloof from her. She has not heard of\r\nmy illness, then, that you are aware of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad of that, for I have been all this time tormenting myself with\r\nthe fear that somebody would tell her I was dying, or desperately ill,\r\nand she would be either distressing herself on account of her inability\r\nto hear from me or do me any good, or perhaps committing the madness of\r\ncoming to see me. I must contrive to let her know something about it,\r\nif I can,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cor she will be hearing some\r\nsuch story. Many would be glad to tell her such news, just to see how\r\nshe would take it; and then she might expose herself to fresh scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had told her,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were not for my promise, I\r\nwould tell her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means! I am not dreaming of that;\xe2\x80\x94but if I were to write a short\r\nnote, now, not mentioning you, Markham, but just giving a slight\r\naccount of my illness, by way of excuse for my not coming to see her,\r\nand to put her on her guard against any exaggerated reports she may\r\nhear,\xe2\x80\x94and address it in a disguised hand\xe2\x80\x94would you do me the favour to\r\nslip it into the post-office as you pass? for I dare not trust any of\r\nthe servants in such a case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMost willingly I consented, and immediately brought him his desk. There\r\nwas little need to disguise his hand, for the poor fellow seemed to\r\nhave considerable difficulty in writing at all, so as to be legible.\r\nWhen the note was done, I thought it time to retire, and took leave,\r\nafter asking if there was anything in the world I could do for him,\r\nlittle or great, in the way of alleviating his sufferings, and\r\nrepairing the injury I had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have already done much towards it; you have done\r\nmore for me than the most skilful physician could do: for you have\r\nrelieved my mind of two great burdens\xe2\x80\x94anxiety on my sister\xe2\x80\x99s account,\r\nand deep regret upon your own: for I do believe these two sources of\r\ntorment have had more effect in working me up into a fever than\r\nanything else; and I am persuaded I shall soon recover now. There is\r\none more thing you can do for me, and that is, come and see me now and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94for you see I am very lonely here, and I promise your entrance\r\nshall not be disputed again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI engaged to do so, and departed with a cordial pressure of the hand. I\r\nposted the letter on my way home, most manfully resisting the\r\ntemptation of dropping in a word from myself at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n\r\nI felt strongly tempted, at times, to enlighten my mother and sister on\r\nthe real character and circumstances of the persecuted tenant of\r\nWildfell Hall, and at first I greatly regretted having omitted to ask\r\nthat lady\xe2\x80\x99s permission to do so; but, on due reflection, I considered\r\nthat if it were known to them, it could not long remain a secret to the\r\nMillwards and Wilsons, and such was my present appreciation of Eliza\r\nMillward\xe2\x80\x99s disposition, that, if once she got a clue to the story, I\r\nshould fear she would soon find means to enlighten Mr. Huntingdon upon\r\nthe place of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s retreat. I would therefore wait patiently till\r\nthese weary six months were over, and then, when the fugitive had found\r\nanother home, and I was permitted to write to her, I would beg to be\r\nallowed to clear her name from these vile calumnies: at present I must\r\ncontent myself with simply asserting that I knew them to be false, and\r\nwould prove it some day, to the shame of those who slandered her. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody believed me, but everybody soon learned to avoid\r\ninsinuating a word against her, or even mentioning her name in my\r\npresence. They thought I was so madly infatuated by the seductions of\r\nthat unhappy lady that I was determined to support her in the very face\r\nof reason; and meantime I grow insupportably morose and misanthropical\r\nfrom the idea that every one I met was harbouring unworthy thoughts of\r\nthe supposed Mrs. Graham, and would express them if he dared. My poor\r\nmother was quite distressed about me; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it\xe2\x80\x94at least I\r\nthought I could not, though sometimes I felt a pang of remorse for my\r\nundutiful conduct to her, and made an effort to amend, attended with\r\nsome partial success; and indeed I was generally more humanised in my\r\ndemeanour to her than to any one else, Mr. Lawrence excepted. Rose and\r\nFergus usually shunned my presence; and it was well they did, for I was\r\nnot fit company for them, nor they for me, under the present\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nMrs. Huntingdon did not leave Wildfell Hall till above two months after\r\nour farewell interview. During that time she never appeared at church,\r\nand I never went near the house: I only knew she was still there by her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s brief answers to my many and varied inquiries respecting her.\r\nI was a very constant and attentive visitor to him throughout the whole\r\nperiod of his illness and convalescence; not only from the interest I\r\ntook in his recovery, and my desire to cheer him up and make the utmost\r\npossible amends for my former \xe2\x80\x9cbrutality,\xe2\x80\x9d but from my growing\r\nattachment to himself, and the increasing pleasure I found in his\r\nsociety\xe2\x80\x94partly from his increased cordiality to me, but chiefly on\r\naccount of his close connection, both in blood and in affection, with\r\nmy adored Helen. I loved him for it better than I liked to express: and\r\nI took a secret delight in pressing those slender white fingers, so\r\nmarvellously like her own, considering he was not a woman, and in\r\nwatching the passing changes in his fair, pale features, and observing\r\nthe intonations of his voice, detecting resemblances which I wondered\r\nhad never struck me before. He provoked me at times, indeed, by his\r\nevident reluctance to talk to me about his sister, though I did not\r\nquestion the friendliness of his motives in wishing to discourage my\r\nremembrance of her.\r\n\r\nHis recovery was not quite so rapid as he had expected it to be; he was\r\nnot able to mount his pony till a fortnight after the date of our\r\nreconciliation; and the first use he made of his returning strength was\r\nto ride over by night to Wildfell Hall, to see his sister. It was a\r\nhazardous enterprise both for him and for her, but he thought it\r\nnecessary to consult with her on the subject of her projected\r\ndeparture, if not to calm her apprehensions respecting his health, and\r\nthe worst result was a slight relapse of his illness, for no one knew\r\nof the visit but the inmates of the old Hall, except myself; and I\r\nbelieve it had not been his intention to mention it to me, for when I\r\ncame to see him the next day, and observed he was not so well as he\r\nought to have been, he merely said he had caught cold by being out too\r\nlate in the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll _never_ be able to see your sister, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take care of\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, a little provoked at the circumstance on her\r\naccount, instead of commiserating him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her already,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he told me what considerations had impelled him to make\r\nthe venture, and with what precautions he had made it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how was she?\xe2\x80\x9d I eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs usual,\xe2\x80\x9d was the brief though sad reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs usual\xe2\x80\x94that is, far from happy and far from strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not positively ill,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he; \xe2\x80\x9cand she will recover her\r\nspirits in a while, I have no doubt\xe2\x80\x94but so many trials have been almost\r\ntoo much for her. How threatening those clouds look,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he,\r\nturning towards the window. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have thunder-showers before\r\nnight, I imagine, and they are just in the midst of stacking my corn.\r\nHave you got yours all in yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. And, Lawrence, did she\xe2\x80\x94did your sister mention me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe asked if I had seen you lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what else did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you all she said,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, with a slight smile; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nwe talked a good deal, though my stay was but short; but our\r\nconversation was chiefly on the subject of her intended departure,\r\nwhich I begged her to delay till I was better able to assist her in her\r\nsearch after another home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut did she say no more about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not say much about you, Markham. I should not have encouraged\r\nher to do so, had she been inclined; but happily she was not: she only\r\nasked a few questions concerning you, and seemed satisfied with my\r\nbrief answers, wherein she showed herself wiser than her friend; and I\r\nmay tell you, too, that she seemed to be far more anxious lest you\r\nshould think too much of her, than lest you should forget her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I fear _your_ anxiety is quite the other way respecting her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not: I wish her to be happy; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish her to forget\r\nme altogether. She knows it is impossible that I should forget _her;_\r\nand she is right to wish me not to remember her too well. I should not\r\ndesire her to regret me _too_ deeply; but I can scarcely imagine she\r\nwill make herself very unhappy about me, because I know I am not worthy\r\nof it, except in my appreciation of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are neither of you worthy of a broken heart,\xe2\x80\x94nor of all the sighs,\r\nand tears, and sorrowful thoughts that have been, and I fear will be,\r\nwasted upon you both; but, at present, each has a more exalted opinion\r\nof the other than, I fear, he or she deserves; and my sister\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\r\nare naturally full as keen as yours, and I believe _more_ constant; but\r\nshe has the good sense and fortitude to strive against them in this\r\nparticular; and I trust she will not rest till she has entirely weaned\r\nher thoughts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish you would make the like exertions,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she _tell_ you that that was her intention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the question was not broached between us: there was no necessity\r\nfor it, for I had no doubt that such was her determination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo forget me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Markham! Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well!\xe2\x80\x9d was my only audible reply; but I internally answered,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nLawrence, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong there: she is _not_ determined to forget me. It\r\nwould be _wrong_ to forget one so deeply and fondly devoted to her, who\r\ncan so thoroughly appreciate her excellencies, and sympathise with all\r\nher thoughts, as I can do, and it would be wrong in me to forget so\r\nexcellent and divine a piece of God\xe2\x80\x99s creation as she, when I have once\r\nso truly loved and known her.\xe2\x80\x9d But I said no more to him on that\r\nsubject. I instantly started a new topic of conversation, and soon took\r\nleave of my companion, with a feeling of less cordiality towards him\r\nthan usual. Perhaps I had no right to be annoyed at him, but I was so\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nIn little more than a week after this I met him returning from a visit\r\nto the Wilsons\xe2\x80\x99; and I now resolved to do _him_ a good turn, though at\r\nthe expense of his feelings, and perhaps at the risk of incurring that\r\ndispleasure which is so commonly the reward of those who give\r\ndisagreeable information, or tender their advice unasked. In this,\r\nbelieve me, I was actuated by no motives of revenge for the occasional\r\nannoyances I had lately sustained from him,\xe2\x80\x94nor yet by any feeling of\r\nmalevolent enmity towards Miss Wilson, but purely by the fact that I\r\ncould not endure that such a woman should be Mrs. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\r\nand that, as well for his own sake as for hers, I could not bear to\r\nthink of his being deceived into a union with one so unworthy of him,\r\nand so utterly unfitted to be the partner of his quiet home, and the\r\ncompanion of his life. He had had uncomfortable suspicions on that head\r\nhimself, I imagined; but such was his inexperience, and such were the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s powers of attraction, and her skill in bringing them to bear\r\nupon his young imagination, that they had not disturbed him long; and I\r\nbelieve the only effectual causes of the vacillating indecision that\r\nhad preserved him hitherto from making an actual declaration of love,\r\nwas the consideration of her connections, and especially of her mother,\r\nwhom he could not abide. Had they lived at a distance, he might have\r\nsurmounted the objection, but within two or three miles of Woodford it\r\nwas really no light matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been to call on the Wilsons, Lawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as I walked\r\nbeside his pony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, slightly averting his face: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it but civil\r\nto take the first opportunity of returning their kind attentions, since\r\nthey have been so very particular and constant in their inquiries\r\nthroughout the whole course of my illness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all Miss Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it is,\xe2\x80\x9d returned he, with a very perceptible blush, \xe2\x80\x9cis that\r\nany reason why I should not make a suitable acknowledgment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a reason why you should not make the acknowledgment she looks\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us drop that subject if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in evident\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lawrence, with your leave we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue it a while longer; and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something, now we\xe2\x80\x99re about it, which you may believe or\r\nnot as you choose\xe2\x80\x94only please to remember that it is not my custom to\r\nspeak falsely, and that in this case I can have no motive for\r\nmisrepresenting the truth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Markham, what now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Miss Wilson hates your sister._ It may be natural enough that, in her\r\nignorance of the relationship, she should feel some degree of enmity\r\nagainst her, but no good or amiable woman would be capable of evincing\r\nthat bitter, cold-blooded, designing malice towards a fancied rival\r\nthat I have observed in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarkham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and it is my belief that Eliza Millward and she, if not the very\r\noriginators of the slanderous reports that have been propagated, were\r\ndesignedly the encouragers and chief disseminators of them. She was not\r\ndesirous to mix up _your_ name in the matter, of course, but her\r\ndelight was, and still is, to blacken your sister\xe2\x80\x99s character to the\r\nutmost of her power, without risking too greatly the exposure of her\r\nown malevolence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted my companion, his face burning with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as I cannot prove it, I must content myself with asserting that\r\nit is so to the best of my belief; but as you would not willingly marry\r\nMiss Wilson if it _were_ so, you will do well to be cautious, till you\r\nhave proved it to be otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never told you, Markham, that I _intended_ to marry Miss Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but whether you do or not, she intends to marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she tell you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have no right to make such an assertion respecting her.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nslightly quickened his pony\xe2\x80\x99s pace, but I laid my hand on its mane,\r\ndetermined he should not leave me yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, Lawrence, and let me explain myself; and don\xe2\x80\x99t be so\r\nvery\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call it\xe2\x80\x94_inaccessible_ as you are.\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nwhat you think of Jane Wilson; and I believe I know how far you are\r\nmistaken in your opinion: you think she is singularly charming,\r\nelegant, sensible, and refined: you are not aware that she is selfish,\r\ncold-hearted, ambitious, artful, shallow-minded\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, Markham\xe2\x80\x94enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; let me finish:\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that, if you married her, your home\r\nwould be rayless and comfortless; and it would break your heart at last\r\nto find yourself united to one so wholly incapable of sharing your\r\ntastes, feelings, and ideas\xe2\x80\x94so utterly destitute of sensibility, good\r\nfeeling, and true nobility of soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my companion quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes;\xe2\x80\x94I know you hate me for my impertinence, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if it\r\nonly conduces to preserve you from that fatal mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d returned he, with a rather wintry smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you have\r\novercome or forgotten your own afflictions so far as to be able to\r\nstudy so deeply the affairs of others, and trouble your head so\r\nunnecessarily about the fancied or possible calamities of their future\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe parted\xe2\x80\x94somewhat coldly again: but still we did not cease to be\r\nfriends; and my well-meant warning, though it might have been more\r\njudiciously delivered, as well as more thankfully received, was not\r\nwholly unproductive of the desired effect: his visit to the Wilsons was\r\nnot repeated, and though, in our subsequent interviews, he never\r\nmentioned her name to me, nor I to him,\xe2\x80\x94I have reason to believe he\r\npondered my words in his mind, eagerly though covertly sought\r\ninformation respecting the fair lady from other quarters, secretly\r\ncompared my character of her with what he had himself observed and what\r\nhe heard from others, and finally came to the conclusion that, all\r\nthings considered, she had much better remain Miss Wilson of Ryecote\r\nFarm than be transmuted into Mrs. Lawrence of Woodford Hall. I believe,\r\ntoo, that he soon learned to contemplate with secret amazement his\r\nformer predilection, and to congratulate himself on the lucky escape he\r\nhad made; but he never confessed it to me, or hinted one word of\r\nacknowledgment for the part I had had in his deliverance, but this was\r\nnot surprising to any one that knew him as I did.\r\n\r\nAs for Jane Wilson, she, of course, was disappointed and embittered by\r\nthe sudden cold neglect and ultimate desertion of her former admirer.\r\nHad I done wrong to blight her cherished hopes? I think not; and\r\ncertainly my conscience has never accused me, from that day to this, of\r\nany evil design in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, about the beginning of November, while I was inditing some\r\nbusiness letters, shortly after breakfast, Eliza Millward came to call\r\nupon my sister. Rose had neither the discrimination nor the virulence\r\nto regard the little demon as I did, and they still preserved their\r\nformer intimacy. At the moment of her arrival, however, there was no\r\none in the room but Fergus and myself, my mother and sister being both\r\nof them absent, \xe2\x80\x9con household cares intent\xe2\x80\x9d; but _I_ was not going to\r\nlay myself out for her amusement, whoever else might so incline: I\r\nmerely honoured her with a careless salutation and a few words of\r\ncourse, and then went on with my writing, leaving my brother to be more\r\npolite if he chose. But she wanted to tease me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pleasure it is to find you at home, Mr. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\nwith a disingenuously malicious smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI so seldom see you now, for\r\nyou never come to the vicarage. Papa, is quite offended, I can tell\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she added playfully, looking into my face with an impertinent\r\nlaugh, as she seated herself, half beside and half before my desk, off\r\nthe corner of the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a good deal to do of late,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, without looking up from\r\nmy letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you, indeed! Somebody said you had been strangely neglecting your\r\nbusiness these last few months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody said wrong, for, these last two months especially, I have\r\nbeen particularly plodding and diligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! well, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like active employment, I suppose, to\r\nconsole the afflicted;\xe2\x80\x94and, excuse me, Mr. Markham, but you look so\r\nvery far from well, and have been, by all accounts, so moody and\r\nthoughtful of late,\xe2\x80\x94I could almost think you have some secret care\r\npreying on your spirits. _Formerly_,\xe2\x80\x9d said she timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cI could have\r\nventured to ask you what it was, and what I could do to comfort you: I\r\ndare not do it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very kind, Miss Eliza. When I think you can do anything to\r\ncomfort me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make bold to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray do!\xe2\x80\x94I suppose I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t guess what it is that troubles you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no necessity, for I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you plainly. The thing that\r\ntroubles me the most at present is a young lady sitting at my elbow,\r\nand preventing me from finishing my letter, and, thereafter, repairing\r\nto my daily business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore she could reply to this ungallant speech, Rose entered the room;\r\nand Miss Eliza rising to greet her, they both seated themselves near\r\nthe fire, where that idle lad Fergus was standing, leaning his shoulder\r\nagainst the corner of the chimney-piece, with his legs crossed and his\r\nhands in his breeches-pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Rose, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a piece of news\xe2\x80\x94I hope you have not heard it\r\nbefore: for good, bad, or indifferent, one always likes to be the first\r\nto tell. It\xe2\x80\x99s about that sad Mrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush-sh-sh!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Fergus, in a tone of solemn import. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We never\r\nmention her; her name is never heard.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d And glancing up, I caught him\r\nwith his eye askance on me, and his finger pointed to his forehead;\r\nthen, winking at the young lady with a doleful shake of the head, he\r\nwhispered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA monomania\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it\xe2\x80\x94all right but that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry to injure any one\xe2\x80\x99s feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d returned she,\r\nspeaking below her breath. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother time, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak out, Miss Eliza!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, not deigning to notice the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbuffooneries: \xe2\x80\x9cyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t fear to say anything in my presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered she, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you know already that Mrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband is not really dead, and that she had run away from him?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nstarted, and felt my face glow; but I bent it over my letter, and went\r\non folding it up as she proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps you did _not_ know that\r\nshe is now gone back to him again, and that a perfect reconciliation\r\nhas taken place between them? Only think,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, turning to\r\nthe confounded Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a fool the man must be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who gave you this piece of intelligence, Miss Eliza?\xe2\x80\x9d said I,\r\ninterrupting my sister\xe2\x80\x99s exclamations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had it from a very authentic source.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom one of the servants at Woodford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I was not aware that you were on such intimate terms with Mr.\r\nLawrence\xe2\x80\x99s household.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not from the man himself that I heard it, but he told it in\r\nconfidence to our maid Sarah, and Sarah told it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn confidence, I suppose? And you tell it in confidence to us? But _I_\r\ncan tell _you_ that it is but a lame story after all, and scarcely\r\none-half of it true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile I spoke I completed the sealing and direction of my letters, with\r\na somewhat unsteady hand, in spite of all my efforts to retain\r\ncomposure, and in spite of my firm conviction that the story _was_ a\r\nlame one\xe2\x80\x94that the supposed Mrs. Graham, most certainly, had not\r\n_voluntarily_ gone back to her husband, or dreamt of a reconciliation.\r\nMost likely she was gone away, and the tale-bearing servant, not\r\nknowing what was become of her, had _conjectured_ that such was the\r\ncase, and our fair visitor had detailed it as a certainty, delighted\r\nwith such an opportunity of tormenting me. But it was possible\xe2\x80\x94barely\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94that some one might have betrayed her, and she had been taken\r\naway by force. Determined to know the worst, I hastily pocketed my two\r\nletters, and muttered something about being too late for the post, left\r\nthe room, rushed into the yard, and vociferously called for my horse.\r\nNo one being there, I dragged him out of the stable myself, strapped\r\nthe saddle on to his back and the bridle on to his head, mounted, and\r\nspeedily galloped away to Woodford. I found its owner pensively\r\nstrolling in the grounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your sister gone?\xe2\x80\x9d were my first words as I grasped his hand,\r\ninstead of the usual inquiry after his health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer, so calmly spoken that my terror was\r\nat once removed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t know where she is?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as I dismounted, and\r\nrelinquished my horse to the gardener, who, being the only servant\r\nwithin call, had been summoned by his master, from his employment of\r\nraking up the dead leaves on the lawn, to take him to the stables.\r\n\r\nMy companion gravely took my arm, and leading me away to the garden,\r\nthus answered my question,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShe is at Grassdale Manor, in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94shire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, with a convulsive start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Grassdale Manor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was it?\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cWho betrayed her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went of her own accord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, Lawrence! She _could_ not be so frantic!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed I,\r\nvehemently grasping his arm, as if to force him to unsay those hateful\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted he in the same grave, collected manner as before;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand not without reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, gently disengaging himself from\r\nmy grasp. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Huntingdon is ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so she went to nurse him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool!\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help exclaiming, and Lawrence looked up with a\r\nrather reproachful glance. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he dying, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not, Markham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how many more nurses has he? How many ladies are there besides to\r\ntake care of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone; he was alone, or she would not have gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, confound it! This is intolerable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is? That he should be alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI attempted no reply, for I was not sure that this circumstance did not\r\npartly conduce to my distraction. I therefore continued to pace the\r\nwalk in silent anguish, with my hand pressed to my forehead; then\r\nsuddenly pausing and turning to my companion, I impatiently exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did she take this infatuated step? What fiend persuaded her to\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing persuaded her but her own sense of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumbug!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was half inclined to say so myself, Markham, at first. I assure you\r\nit was not by my advice that she went, for I detest that man as\r\nfervently as you can do,\xe2\x80\x94except, indeed, that his reformation would\r\ngive me much greater pleasure than his death; but all I did was to\r\ninform her of the circumstance of his illness (the consequence of a\r\nfall from his horse in hunting), and to tell her that that unhappy\r\nperson, Miss Myers, had left him some time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was ill done! Now, when he finds the convenience of her presence,\r\nhe will make all manner of lying speeches and false, fair promises for\r\nthe future, and she will believe him, and then her condition will be\r\nten times worse and ten times more irremediable than before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere does not appear to be much ground for such apprehensions at\r\npresent,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, producing a letter from his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the\r\naccount I received this morning, I should say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was _her_ writing! By an irresistible impulse I held out my hand,\r\nand the words, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see it,\xe2\x80\x9d involuntarily passed my lips. He was\r\nevidently reluctant to grant the request, but while he hesitated I\r\nsnatched it from his hand. Recollecting myself, however, the minute\r\nafter, I offered to restore it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, take it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may read it if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI read it, and so may you.\r\n\r\nGrassdale, Nov. 4th.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR FREDERICK,\xe2\x80\x94I know you will be anxious to hear from me, and I will\r\ntell you all I can. Mr. Huntingdon is very ill, but not dying, or in\r\nany immediate danger; and he is rather better at present than he was\r\nwhen I came. I found the house in sad confusion: Mrs. Greaves, Benson,\r\nevery decent servant had left, and those that were come to supply their\r\nplaces were a negligent, disorderly set, to say no worse\xe2\x80\x94I must change\r\nthem again, if I stay. A professional nurse, a grim, hard old woman,\r\nhad been hired to attend the wretched invalid. He suffers much, and has\r\nno fortitude to bear him through. The immediate injuries he sustained\r\nfrom the accident, however, were not very severe, and would, as the\r\ndoctor says, have been but trifling to a man of temperate habits, but\r\nwith _him_ it is very different. On the night of my arrival, when I\r\nfirst entered his room, he was lying in a kind of half delirium. He did\r\nnot notice me till I spoke, and then he mistook me for another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Alice, come again?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you leave me\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I, Arthur\xe2\x80\x94it is Helen, your wife,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a start. \xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t mention\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94I have none. Devil take her,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, a moment after, \xe2\x80\x9cand you,\r\ntoo! What did you do it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said no more; but observing that he kept gazing towards the foot of\r\nthe bed, I went and sat there, placing the light so as to shine full\r\nupon me, for I thought he might be dying, and I wanted him to know me.\r\nFor a long time he lay silently looking upon me, first with a vacant\r\nstare, then with a fixed gaze of strange growing intensity. At last he\r\nstartled me by suddenly raising himself on his elbow and demanding in a\r\nhorrified whisper, with his eyes still fixed upon me, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Helen Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, quietly rising at the same time, and\r\nremoving to a less conspicuous position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be going mad,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cor something\xe2\x80\x94delirious, perhaps; but\r\nleave me, whoever you are. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear that white face, and those\r\neyes. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake go, and send me somebody else that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nlike that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went at once, and sent the hired nurse; but next morning I ventured\r\nto enter his chamber again, and, taking the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s place by his\r\nbedside, I watched him and waited on him for several hours, showing\r\nmyself as little as possible, and only speaking when necessary, and\r\nthen not above my breath. At first he addressed me as the nurse, but,\r\non my crossing the room to draw up the window-blinds, in obedience to\r\nhis directions, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t nurse; it\xe2\x80\x99s Alice. Stay with me,\r\ndo! That old hag will be the death of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to stay with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. And after that he would call me\r\nAlice, or some other name almost equally repugnant to my feelings. I\r\nforced myself to endure it for a while, fearing a contradiction might\r\ndisturb him too much; but when, having asked for a glass of water,\r\nwhile I held it to his lips, he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, dearest!\xe2\x80\x9d I could\r\nnot help distinctly observing, \xe2\x80\x9cYou would not say so if you knew me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nintending to follow that up with another declaration of my identity;\r\nbut he merely muttered an incoherent reply, so I dropped it again, till\r\nsome time after, when, as I was bathing his forehead and temples with\r\nvinegar and water to relieve the heat and pain in his head, he\r\nobserved, after looking earnestly upon me for some minutes, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nsuch strange fancies\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of them, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\nrest; and the most singular and pertinacious of them all is your face\r\nand voice\xe2\x80\x94they seem just like hers. I could swear at this moment that\r\nshe was by my side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seems comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, without noticing my words; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwhile you do it, the other fancies fade away\xe2\x80\x94but _this_ only\r\nstrengthens.\xe2\x80\x94Go on\xe2\x80\x94go on, till it vanishes, too. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand such a\r\nmania as this; it would kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt never will vanish,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, distinctly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, starting, as if an asp had stung him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to say that you are really she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do; but you needn\xe2\x80\x99t shrink away from me, as if I were your greatest\r\nenemy: I am come to take care of you, and do what none of _them_ would\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t torment me now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he in pitiable agitation;\r\nand then he began to mutter bitter curses against me, or the evil\r\nfortune that had brought me there; while I put down the sponge and\r\nbasin, and resumed my seat at the bed-side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they?\xe2\x80\x9d said he: \xe2\x80\x9chave they all left me\xe2\x80\x94servants and all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are servants within call if you want them; but you had better\r\nlie down now and be quiet: none of them could or would attend you as\r\ncarefully as I shall do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in bewildered perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cWas\r\nit a dream that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and he covered his eyes with his hands, as if trying\r\nto unravel the mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Arthur, it was not a dream, that your conduct was such as to\r\noblige me to leave you; but I heard that you were ill and alone, and I\r\nam come back to nurse you. You need not fear to trust me: tell me all\r\nyour wants, and I will try to satisfy them. There is no one else to\r\ncare for you; and I shall not upbraid you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a bitter smile; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s an act of Christian\r\ncharity, whereby you hope to gain a higher seat in heaven for yourself,\r\nand scoop a deeper pit in hell for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I came to offer you that comfort and assistance your situation\r\nrequired; and if I could benefit your soul as well as your body, and\r\nawaken some sense of contrition and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; if you could overwhelm me with remorse and confusion of face,\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x99s the time. What have you done with my son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is well, and you may see him some time, if you will compose\r\nyourself, but not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherever he is, you will not see him till you have promised to leave\r\nhim entirely under my care and protection, and to let me take him away\r\nwhenever and wherever I please, if I should hereafter judge it\r\nnecessary to remove him again. But we will talk of that to-morrow: you\r\nmust be quiet now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, let me see him now, I promise, if it _must_ be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear it, as God is in Heaven! Now, then, let me see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot trust your oaths and promises: I must have a written\r\nagreement, and you must sign it in presence of a witness: but not\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, to-day; now,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted he: and he was in such a state of feverish\r\nexcitement, and so bent upon the immediate gratification of his wish,\r\nthat I thought it better to grant it at once, as I saw he would not\r\nrest till I did. But I was determined my son\xe2\x80\x99s interest should not be\r\nforgotten; and having clearly written out the promise I wished Mr.\r\nHuntingdon to give upon a slip of paper, I deliberately read it over to\r\nhim, and made him sign it in the presence of Rachel. He begged I would\r\nnot insist upon this: it was a useless exposure of my want of faith in\r\nhis word to the servant. I told him I was sorry, but since he had\r\nforfeited my confidence, he must take the consequence. He next pleaded\r\ninability to hold the pen. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we must wait until you can hold it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid I. Upon which he said he would try; but then he could not see to\r\nwrite. I placed my finger where the signature was to be, and told him\r\nhe might write his name in the dark, if he only knew where to put it.\r\nBut he had not power to form the letters. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, you must be\r\ntoo ill to see the child,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and finding me inexorable, he at\r\nlength managed to ratify the agreement; and I bade Rachel send the boy.\r\n\r\nAll this may strike you as harsh, but I felt I must not lose my present\r\nadvantage, and my son\xe2\x80\x99s future welfare should not be sacrificed to any\r\nmistaken tenderness for this man\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. Little Arthur had not\r\nforgotten his father, but thirteen months of absence, during which he\r\nhad seldom been permitted to hear a word about him, or hardly to\r\nwhisper his name, had rendered him somewhat shy; and when he was\r\nushered into the darkened room where the sick man lay, so altered from\r\nhis former self, with fiercely flushed face and wildly-gleaming eyes\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ninstinctively clung to me, and stood looking on his father with a\r\ncountenance expressive of far more awe than pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, extending his hand towards him.\r\nThe child went, and timidly touched that burning hand, but almost\r\nstarted in alarm, when his father suddenly clutched his arm and drew\r\nhim nearer to his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Huntingdon, intently perusing his features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you glad to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re _not!_\xe2\x80\x9d replied the disappointed parent, relaxing his hold, and\r\ndarting a vindictive glance at me.\r\n\r\nArthur, thus released, crept back to me and put his hand in mine. His\r\nfather swore I had made the child hate him, and abused and cursed me\r\nbitterly. The instant he began I sent our son out of the room; and when\r\nhe paused to breathe, I calmly assured him that he was entirely\r\nmistaken; I had never once attempted to prejudice his child against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did indeed desire him to _forget_ you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand especially to\r\nforget the lessons you taught him; and for that cause, and to lessen\r\nthe danger of discovery, I own I have generally discouraged his\r\ninclination to talk about you; but no one can blame me for that, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe invalid only replied by groaning aloud, and rolling his head on a\r\npillow in a paroxysm of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in hell, already!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cThis cursed thirst is burning my\r\nheart to ashes! Will _nobody_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he could finish the sentence I had poured out a glass of some\r\nacidulated, cooling drink that was on the table, and brought it to him.\r\nHe drank it greedily, but muttered, as I took away the glass,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you\xe2\x80\x99re heaping coals of fire on my head, you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot noticing this speech, I asked if there was anything else I could do\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you another opportunity of showing your Christian\r\nmagnanimity,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered he: \xe2\x80\x9cset my pillow straight, and these confounded\r\nbed-clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d I did so. \xe2\x80\x9cThere: now get me another glass of that slop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI complied. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is delightful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said he with a malicious\r\ngrin, as I held it to his lips; \xe2\x80\x9cyou never hoped for such a glorious\r\nopportunity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, shall I stay with you?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as I replaced the glass on the\r\ntable: \xe2\x80\x9cor will you be more quiet if I go and send the nurse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re wondrous gentle and obliging! But you\xe2\x80\x99ve driven me mad\r\nwith it all!\xe2\x80\x9d responded he, with an impatient toss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and I withdrew, and did not trouble him\r\nwith my presence again that day, except for a minute or two at a time,\r\njust to see how he was and what he wanted.\r\n\r\nNext morning the doctor ordered him to be bled; and after that he was\r\nmore subdued and tranquil. I passed half the day in his room at\r\ndifferent intervals. My presence did not appear to agitate or irritate\r\nhim as before, and he accepted my services quietly, without any bitter\r\nremarks: indeed, he scarcely spoke at all, except to make known his\r\nwants, and hardly then. But on the morrow, that is to say, in\r\nproportion as he recovered from the state of exhaustion and\r\nstupefaction, his ill-nature appeared to revive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, this sweet revenge!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, when I had been doing all I could\r\nto make him comfortable and to remedy the carelessness of his nurse.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can enjoy it with such a quiet conscience too, because it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall in the way of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well for me that I _am_ doing my duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with a\r\nbitterness I could not repress, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is the only comfort I have; and\r\nthe satisfaction of my own conscience, it seems, is the only reward I\r\nneed look for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked rather surprised at the earnestness of my manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reward _did_ you look for?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will think me a liar if I tell you; but I _did_ hope to benefit\r\nyou: as well to better your mind as to alleviate your present\r\nsufferings; but it appears I am to do neither; your own bad spirit will\r\nnot let me. As far as _you_ are concerned, I have sacrificed my own\r\nfeelings, and all the little earthly comfort that was left me, to no\r\npurpose; and every little thing I do for you is ascribed to\r\nself-righteous malice and refined revenge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine, I daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, eyeing me with stupid\r\namazement; \xe2\x80\x9cand of course I ought to be melted to tears of penitence\r\nand admiration at the sight of so much generosity and superhuman\r\ngoodness; but you see I can\xe2\x80\x99t manage it. However, pray do me all the\r\ngood you can, if you do really find any pleasure in it; for you\r\nperceive I am almost as miserable just now as you need wish to see me.\r\nSince you came, I confess, I have had better attendance than before,\r\nfor these wretches neglected me shamefully, and all my old friends seem\r\nto have fairly forsaken me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a dreadful time of it, I assure\r\nyou: I sometimes thought I should have died: do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any\r\nchance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s always a chance of death; and it is always well to live with\r\nsuch a chance in view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! but do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any likelihood that this illness\r\nwill have a fatal termination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell; but, supposing it should, how are you prepared to meet\r\nthe event?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the doctor told me I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to think about it, for I was sure to\r\nget better if I stuck to his regimen and prescriptions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you may, Arthur; but neither the doctor nor I can speak with\r\ncertainty in such a case; there is internal injury, and it is difficult\r\nto know to what extent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now! you want to scare me to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lull you to false security. If a consciousness\r\nof the uncertainty of life can dispose you to serious and useful\r\nthoughts, I would not deprive you of the benefit of such reflections,\r\nwhether you do eventually recover or not. Does the idea of death appal\r\nyou very much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just the only thing I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of; so if you\xe2\x80\x99ve any\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it must come some time,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted I, \xe2\x80\x9cand if it be years hence,\r\nit will as certainly overtake you as if it came to-day,\xe2\x80\x94and no doubt be\r\nas unwelcome then as now, unless you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang it! don\xe2\x80\x99t torment me with your preachments now, unless you\r\nwant to kill me outright. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it, I tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sufferings\r\nenough without that. If you think there\xe2\x80\x99s danger, save me from it; and\r\nthen, in gratitude, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hear whatever you like to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI accordingly dropped the unwelcome topic. And now, Frederick, I think\r\nI may bring my letter to a close. From these details you may form your\r\nown judgment of the state of my patient, and of my own position and\r\nfuture prospects. Let me hear from you soon, and I will write again to\r\ntell you how we get on; but now that my presence is tolerated, and even\r\nrequired, in the sick-room, I shall have but little time to spare\r\nbetween my husband and my son,\xe2\x80\x94for I must not entirely neglect the\r\nlatter: it would not do to keep him always with Rachel, and I dare not\r\nleave him for a moment with any of the other servants, or suffer him to\r\nbe alone, lest he should meet them. If his father get worse, I shall\r\nask Esther Hargrave to take charge of him for a time, till I have\r\nreorganised the household at least; but I greatly prefer keeping him\r\nunder my own eye.\r\n\r\nI find myself in rather a singular position: I am exerting my utmost\r\nendeavours to promote the recovery and reformation of my husband, and\r\nif I succeed, what shall I do? My duty, of course,\xe2\x80\x94but how? No matter;\r\nI can perform the task that is before me now, and God will give me\r\nstrength to do whatever He requires hereafter. Good-by, dear Frederick.\r\n\r\nHELEN HUNTINGDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawrence, as I silently refolded the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she is casting her pearls before\r\nswine. May they be satisfied with trampling them under their feet, and\r\nnot turn again and rend her! But I shall say no more against her: I see\r\nthat she was actuated by the best and noblest motives in what she has\r\ndone; and if the act is not a wise one, may heaven protect her from its\r\nconsequences! May I keep this letter, Lawrence?\xe2\x80\x94you see she has never\r\nonce mentioned me throughout\xe2\x80\x94or made the most distant allusion to me;\r\ntherefore, there can be no impropriety or harm in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, therefore, why should you wish to keep it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere not these characters written by her hand? and were not these\r\nwords conceived in her mind, and many of them spoken by her lips?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. And so I kept it; otherwise, Halford, you could never\r\nhave become so thoroughly acquainted with its contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when you write,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you have the goodness to ask her if\r\nI may be permitted to enlighten my mother and sister on her real\r\nhistory and circumstance, just so far as is necessary to make the\r\nneighbourhood sensible of the shameful injustice they have done her? I\r\nwant no tender messages, but just ask her that, and tell her it is the\r\ngreatest favour she could do me; and tell her\xe2\x80\x94no, nothing more. You see\r\nI know the address, and I might write to her myself, but I am so\r\nvirtuous as to refrain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do this for you, Markham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as soon as you receive an answer, you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all be well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come myself and tell you immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFive or six days after this Mr. Lawrence paid us the honour of a call;\r\nand when he and I were alone together\xe2\x80\x94which I contrived as soon as\r\npossible by bringing him out to look at my cornstacks\xe2\x80\x94he showed me\r\nanother letter from his sister. This one he was quite willing to submit\r\nto my longing gaze; he thought, I suppose, it would do me good. The\r\nonly answer it gave to my message was this:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Markham is at liberty to make such revelations concerning me as he\r\njudges necessary. He will know that I should wish but little to be said\r\non the subject. I hope he is well; but tell him he must not think of\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI can give you a few extracts from the rest of the letter, for I was\r\npermitted to keep this also\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, as an antidote to all pernicious\r\nhopes and fancies.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is decidedly better, but very low from the depressing effects of his\r\nsevere illness and the strict regimen he is obliged to observe\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nopposite to all his previous habits. It is deplorable to see how\r\ncompletely his past life has degenerated his once noble constitution,\r\nand vitiated the whole system of his organization. But the doctor says\r\nhe may now be considered out of danger, if he will only continue to\r\nobserve the necessary restrictions. Some stimulating cordials he must\r\nhave, but they should be judiciously diluted and sparingly used; and I\r\nfind it very difficult to keep him to this. At first, his extreme dread\r\nof death rendered the task an easy one; but in proportion as he feels\r\nhis acute suffering abating, and sees the danger receding, the more\r\nintractable he becomes. Now, also, his appetite for food is beginning\r\nto return; and here, too, his long habits of self-indulgence are\r\ngreatly against him. I watch and restrain him as well as I can, and\r\noften get bitterly abused for my rigid severity; and sometimes he\r\ncontrives to elude my vigilance, and sometimes acts in opposition to my\r\nwill. But he is now so completely reconciled to my attendance in\r\ngeneral that he is never satisfied when I am not by his side. I am\r\nobliged to be a little stiff with him sometimes, or he would make a\r\ncomplete slave of me; and I know it would be unpardonable weakness to\r\ngive up all other interests for him. I have the servants to overlook,\r\nand my little Arthur to attend to,\xe2\x80\x94and my own health too, all of which\r\nwould be entirely neglected were I to satisfy his exorbitant demands. I\r\ndo not generally sit up at night, for I think the nurse who has made it\r\nher business is better qualified for such undertakings than I am;\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nstill, an unbroken night\xe2\x80\x99s rest is what I but seldom enjoy, and never\r\ncan venture to reckon upon; for my patient makes no scruple of calling\r\nme up at an hour when his wants or his fancies require my presence. But\r\nhe is manifestly afraid of my displeasure; and if at one time he tries\r\nmy patience by his unreasonable exactions, and fretful complaints and\r\nreproaches, at another he depresses me by his abject submission and\r\ndeprecatory self-abasement when he fears he has gone too far. But all\r\nthis I can readily pardon; I know it is chiefly the result of his\r\nenfeebled frame and disordered nerves. What annoys me the most, is his\r\noccasional attempts at affectionate fondness that I can neither credit\r\nnor return; not that I hate him: his sufferings and my own laborious\r\ncare have given him some claim to my regard\xe2\x80\x94to my affection even, if he\r\nwould only be quiet and sincere, and content to let things remain as\r\nthey are; but the more he tries to conciliate me, the more I shrink\r\nfrom him and from the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, what do you mean to do when I get well?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked this morning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you run away again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt entirely depends upon your own conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be very good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I find it necessary to leave you, Arthur, I shall not \xe2\x80\x98run\r\naway\xe2\x80\x99: you know I have your own promise that I may go whenever I\r\nplease, and take my son with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you shall have no cause.\xe2\x80\x9d And then followed a variety of\r\nprofessions, which I rather coldly checked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not forgive me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x94I _have_ forgiven you: but I know you cannot love me as you once\r\ndid\xe2\x80\x94and I should be very sorry if you were to, for I could not pretend\r\nto return it: so let us drop the subject, and never recur to it again.\r\nBy what I _have_ done for you, you may judge of what I _will_ do\xe2\x80\x94if it\r\nbe not incompatible with the higher duty I owe to my son (higher,\r\nbecause he never forfeited his claims, and because I hope to do more\r\ngood to him than I can ever do to you); and if you wish me to feel\r\nkindly towards you, it is _deeds_ not _words_ which must purchase my\r\naffection and esteem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sole reply to this was a slight grimace, and a scarcely perceptible\r\nshrug. Alas, unhappy man! words, with him, are so much cheaper than\r\ndeeds; it was as if I had said, \xe2\x80\x9cPounds, not pence, must buy the\r\narticle you want.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he sighed a querulous, self-commiserating\r\nsigh, as if in pure regret that he, the loved and courted of so many\r\nworshippers, should be now abandoned to the mercy of a harsh, exacting,\r\ncold-hearted woman like that, and even glad of what kindness she chose\r\nto bestow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and whether I rightly divined his\r\nmusings or not, the observation chimed in with his thoughts, for he\r\nanswered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d with a rueful smile at my penetration.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seen Esther Hargrave twice. She is a charming creature, but her\r\nblithe spirit is almost broken, and her sweet temper almost spoiled, by\r\nthe still unremitting persecutions of her mother in behalf of her\r\nrejected suitor\xe2\x80\x94not violent, but wearisome and unremitting like a\r\ncontinual dropping. The unnatural parent seems determined to make her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s life a burden, if she will not yield to her desires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma does all she can,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cto make me feel myself a burden\r\nand incumbrance to the family, and the most ungrateful, selfish, and\r\nundutiful daughter that ever was born; and Walter, too, is as stern and\r\ncold and haughty as if he hated me outright. I believe I should have\r\nyielded at once if I had known, from the beginning, how much resistance\r\nwould have cost me; but now, for very obstinacy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, I _will_ stand\r\nout!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad motive for a good resolve,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, however, I know\r\nyou have better motives, really, for your perseverance: and I counsel\r\nyou to keep them still in view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me I will. I threaten mamma sometimes that I\xe2\x80\x99ll run away, and\r\ndisgrace the family by earning my own livelihood, if she torments me\r\nany more; and then that frightens her a little. But I _will_ do it, in\r\ngood earnest, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet and patient a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand better times will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor girl! I wish somebody that was worthy to possess her would come\r\nand take her away\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Frederick?\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the perusal of this letter filled me with dismay for Helen\xe2\x80\x99s future\r\nlife and mine, there was one great source of consolation: it was now in\r\nmy power to clear her name from every foul aspersion. The Millwards and\r\nthe Wilsons should see with their own eyes the bright sun bursting from\r\nthe cloud\xe2\x80\x94and they should be scorched and dazzled by its beams;\xe2\x80\x94and my\r\nown friends too should see it\xe2\x80\x94they whose suspicions had been such gall\r\nand wormwood to my soul. To effect this I had only to drop the seed\r\ninto the ground, and it would soon become a stately, branching herb: a\r\nfew words to my mother and sister, I knew, would suffice to spread the\r\nnews throughout the whole neighbourhood, without any further exertion\r\non my part.\r\n\r\nRose was delighted; and as soon as I had told her all I thought\r\nproper\xe2\x80\x94which was all I affected to know\xe2\x80\x94she flew with alacrity to put\r\non her bonnet and shawl, and hasten to carry the glad tidings to the\r\nMillwards and Wilsons\xe2\x80\x94glad tidings, I suspect, to none but herself and\r\nMary Millward\xe2\x80\x94that steady, sensible girl, whose sterling worth had been\r\nso quickly perceived and duly valued by the supposed Mrs. Graham, in\r\nspite of her plain outside; and who, on her part, had been better able\r\nto see and appreciate that lady\xe2\x80\x99s true character and qualities than the\r\nbrightest genius among them.\r\n\r\nAs I may never have occasion to mention her again, I may as well tell\r\nyou here that she was at this time privately engaged to Richard\r\nWilson\xe2\x80\x94a secret, I believe, to every one but themselves. That worthy\r\nstudent was now at Cambridge, where his most exemplary conduct and his\r\ndiligent perseverance in the pursuit of learning carried him safely\r\nthrough, and eventually brought him with hard-earned honours, and an\r\nuntarnished reputation, to the close of his collegiate career. In due\r\ntime he became Mr. Millward\xe2\x80\x99s first and only curate\xe2\x80\x94for that\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s declining years forced him at last to acknowledge that the\r\nduties of his extensive parish were a little too much for those vaunted\r\nenergies which he was wont to boast over his younger and less active\r\nbrethren of the cloth. This was what the patient, faithful lovers had\r\nprivately planned and quietly waited for years ago; and in due time\r\nthey were united, to the astonishment of the little world they lived\r\nin, that had long since declared them both born to single blessedness;\r\naffirming it impossible that the pale, retiring bookworm should ever\r\nsummon courage to seek a wife, or be able to obtain one if he did, and\r\nequally impossible that the plain-looking, plain-dealing, unattractive,\r\nunconciliating Miss Millward should ever find a husband.\r\n\r\nThey still continued to live at the vicarage, the lady dividing her\r\ntime between her father, her husband, and their poor parishioners,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsubsequently her rising family; and now that the Reverend Michael\r\nMillward has been gathered to his fathers, full of years and honours,\r\nthe Reverend Richard Wilson has succeeded him to the vicarage of\r\nLindenhope, greatly to the satisfaction of its inhabitants, who had so\r\nlong tried and fully proved his merits, and those of his excellent and\r\nwell-loved partner.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the after fate of that lady\xe2\x80\x99s sister, I can\r\nonly tell you\xe2\x80\x94what perhaps you have heard from another quarter\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nsome twelve or thirteen years ago she relieved the happy couple of her\r\npresence by marrying a wealthy tradesman of L\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t envy him\r\nhis bargain. I fear she leads him a rather uncomfortable life, though,\r\nhappily, he is too dull to perceive the extent of his misfortune. I\r\nhave little enough to do with her myself: we have not met for many\r\nyears; but, I am well assured, she has not yet forgotten or forgiven\r\neither her former lover, or the lady whose superior qualities first\r\nopened his eyes to the folly of his boyish attachment.\r\n\r\nAs for Richard Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s sister, she, having been wholly unable to\r\nrecapture Mr. Lawrence, or obtain any partner rich and elegant enough\r\nto suit her ideas of what the husband of Jane Wilson ought to be, is\r\nyet in single blessedness. Shortly after the death of her mother she\r\nwithdrew the light of her presence from Ryecote Farm, finding it\r\nimpossible any longer to endure the rough manners and unsophisticated\r\nhabits of her honest brother Robert and his worthy wife, or the idea of\r\nbeing identified with such vulgar people in the eyes of the world, and\r\ntook lodgings in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 the county town, where she lived, and still lives,\r\nI suppose, in a kind of close-fisted, cold, uncomfortable gentility,\r\ndoing no good to others, and but little to herself; spending her days\r\nin fancy-work and scandal; referring frequently to her \xe2\x80\x9cbrother the\r\nvicar,\xe2\x80\x9d and her \xe2\x80\x9csister, the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s lady,\xe2\x80\x9d but never to her brother\r\nthe farmer and her sister the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife; seeing as much company as\r\nshe can without too much expense, but loving no one and beloved by\r\nnone\xe2\x80\x94a cold-hearted, supercilious, keenly, insidiously censorious old\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s health was now quite re-established, my visits to\r\nWoodford were as unremitting as ever; though often less protracted than\r\nbefore. We seldom _talked_ about Mrs. Huntingdon; but yet we never met\r\nwithout mentioning her, for I never sought his company but with the\r\nhope of hearing something about her, and he never sought mine at all,\r\nbecause he saw me often enough without. But I always began to talk of\r\nother things, and waited first to see if _he_ would introduce the\r\nsubject. If he did not, I would casually ask, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard from your\r\nsister lately?\xe2\x80\x9d If he said \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the matter was dropped: if he said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I would venture to inquire, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is she?\xe2\x80\x9d but never \xe2\x80\x9cHow is her\r\nhusband?\xe2\x80\x9d though I might be burning to know; because I had not the\r\nhypocrisy to profess any anxiety for his recovery, and I had not the\r\nface to express any desire for a contrary result. Had I any such\r\ndesire?\xe2\x80\x94I fear I must plead guilty; but since you have heard my\r\nconfession, you must hear my justification as well\xe2\x80\x94a few of the\r\nexcuses, at least, wherewith I sought to pacify my own accusing\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, you see, his life did harm to others, and evidently\r\nno good to himself; and though I wished it to terminate, I would not\r\nhave hastened its close if, by the lifting of a finger, I could have\r\ndone so, or if a spirit had whispered in my ear that a single effort of\r\nthe will would be enough,\xe2\x80\x94unless, indeed, I had the power to exchange\r\nhim for some other victim of the grave, whose life might be of service\r\nto his race, and whose death would be lamented by his friends. But was\r\nthere any harm in wishing that, among the many thousands whose souls\r\nwould certainly be required of them before the year was over, this\r\nwretched mortal might be one? I thought not; and therefore I wished\r\nwith all my heart that it might please heaven to remove him to a better\r\nworld, or if that might not be, still to take him out of this; for if\r\nhe were unfit to answer the summons now, after a warning sickness, and\r\nwith such an angel by his side, it seemed but too certain that he never\r\nwould be\xe2\x80\x94that, on the contrary, returning health would bring returning\r\nlust and villainy, and as he grew more certain of recovery, more\r\naccustomed to her generous goodness, his feelings would become more\r\ncallous, his heart more flinty and impervious to her persuasive\r\narguments\xe2\x80\x94but God knew best. Meantime, however, I could not but be\r\nanxious for the result of His decrees; knowing, as I did, that (leaving\r\nmyself entirely out of the question), however Helen might feel\r\ninterested in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s welfare, however she might deplore his\r\nfate, still while he lived she must be miserable.\r\n\r\nA fortnight passed away, and my inquiries were always answered in the\r\nnegative. At length a welcome \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d drew from me the second question.\r\nLawrence divined my anxious thoughts, and appreciated my reserve. I\r\nfeared, at first, he was going to torture me by unsatisfactory replies,\r\nand either leave me quite in the dark concerning what I wanted to know,\r\nor force me to drag the information out of him, morsel by morsel, by\r\ndirect inquiries. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd serve you right,\xe2\x80\x9d you will say; but he was more\r\nmerciful; and in a little while he put his sister\xe2\x80\x99s letter into my\r\nhand. I silently read it, and restored it to him without comment or\r\nremark. This mode of procedure suited him so well, that thereafter he\r\nalways pursued the plan of showing me her letters at once, when\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinquired\xe2\x80\x9d after her, if there were any to show\xe2\x80\x94it was so much less\r\ntrouble than to tell me their contents; and I received such confidences\r\nso quietly and discreetly that he was never induced to discontinue\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut I devoured those precious letters with my eyes, and never let them\r\ngo till their contents were stamped upon my mind; and when I got home,\r\nthe most important passages were entered in my diary among the\r\nremarkable events of the day.\r\n\r\nThe first of these communications brought intelligence of a serious\r\nrelapse in Mr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s illness, entirely the result of his own\r\ninfatuation in persisting in the indulgence of his appetite for\r\nstimulating drink. In vain had she remonstrated, in vain she had\r\nmingled his wine with water: her arguments and entreaties were a\r\nnuisance, her interference was an insult so intolerable that, at\r\nlength, on finding she had covertly diluted the pale port that was\r\nbrought him, he threw the bottle out of the window, swearing he would\r\nnot be cheated like a baby, ordered the butler, on pain of instant\r\ndismissal, to bring a bottle of the strongest wine in the cellar, and\r\naffirming that he should have been well long ago if he had been let to\r\nhave his own way, but she wanted to keep him weak in order that she\r\nmight have him under her thumb\xe2\x80\x94but, by the Lord Harry, he would have no\r\nmore humbug\xe2\x80\x94seized a glass in one hand and the bottle in the other, and\r\nnever rested till he had drunk it dry. Alarming symptoms were the\r\nimmediate result of this \xe2\x80\x9cimprudence,\xe2\x80\x9d as she mildly termed it\xe2\x80\x94symptoms\r\nwhich had rather increased than diminished since; and this was the\r\ncause of her delay in writing to her brother. Every former feature of\r\nhis malady had returned with augmented virulence: the slight external\r\nwound, half healed, had broken out afresh; internal inflammation had\r\ntaken place, which might terminate fatally if not soon removed. Of\r\ncourse, the wretched sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s temper was not improved by this\r\ncalamity\xe2\x80\x94in fact, I suspect it was well nigh insupportable, though his\r\nkind nurse did not complain; but she said she had been obliged at last\r\nto give her son in charge to Esther Hargrave, as her presence was so\r\nconstantly required in the sick-room that she could not possibly attend\r\nto him herself; and though the child had begged to be allowed to\r\ncontinue with her there, and to help her to nurse his papa, and though\r\nshe had no doubt he would have been very good and quiet, she could not\r\nthink of subjecting his young and tender feelings to the sight of so\r\nmuch suffering, or of allowing him to witness his father\xe2\x80\x99s impatience,\r\nor hear the dreadful language he was wont to use in his paroxysms of\r\npain or irritation.\r\n\r\nThe latter (continued she) most deeply regrets the step that has\r\noccasioned his relapse; but, as usual, he throws the blame upon me. If\r\nI had reasoned with him like a rational creature, he says, it never\r\nwould have happened; but to be treated like a baby or a fool was enough\r\nto put any man past his patience, and drive him to assert his\r\nindependence even at the sacrifice of his own interest. He forgets how\r\noften I had _reasoned_ him \xe2\x80\x9cpast his patience\xe2\x80\x9d before. He appears to be\r\nsensible of his danger; but nothing can induce him to behold it in the\r\nproper light. The other night, while I was waiting on him, and just as\r\nI had brought him a draught to assuage his burning thirst, he observed,\r\nwith a return of his former sarcastic bitterness, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re mighty\r\nattentive _now!_ I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s _nothing_ you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for me\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, a little surprised at his manner, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am\r\nwilling to do anything I can to relieve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _now_, my immaculate angel; but when once you have secured your\r\nreward, and find yourself safe in heaven, and me howling in hell-fire,\r\ncatch you lifting a finger to serve me _then!_ No, you\xe2\x80\x99ll look\r\ncomplacently on, and not so much as dip the tip of your finger in water\r\nto cool my tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so, it will be because of the great gulf over which I cannot pass;\r\nand if I _could_ look complacently on in such a case, it would be only\r\nfrom the assurance that you were being purified from your sins, and\r\nfitted to enjoy the happiness I felt.\xe2\x80\x94But are you _determined_, Arthur,\r\nthat I shall not meet you in heaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! What should I do there, I should like to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I cannot tell; and I fear it is too certain that your tastes\r\nand feelings must be widely altered before you can have any enjoyment\r\nthere. But do you prefer sinking, without an effort, into the state of\r\ntorment you picture to yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all a fable,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, Arthur? are you _quite_ sure? Because, if there is any\r\ndoubt, and if you _should_ find yourself mistaken after all, when it is\r\ntoo late to turn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be rather awkward, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to die yet. I can\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he added vehemently,\r\nas if suddenly struck with the appalling aspect of that terrible event.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, you _must_ save me!\xe2\x80\x9d And he earnestly seized my hand, and\r\nlooked into my face with such imploring eagerness that my heart bled\r\nfor him, and I could not speak for tears.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next letter brought intelligence that the malady was fast\r\nincreasing; and the poor sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s horror of death was still more\r\ndistressing than his impatience of bodily pain. _All_ his friends had\r\nnot forsaken him; for Mr. Hattersley, hearing of his danger, had come\r\nto see him from his distant home in the north. His wife had accompanied\r\nhim, as much for the pleasure of seeing her dear friend, from whom she\r\nhad been parted so long, as to visit her mother and sister.\r\n\r\nMrs. Huntingdon expressed herself glad to see Milicent once more, and\r\npleased to behold her so happy and well. She is now at the Grove,\r\ncontinued the letter, but she often calls to see me. Mr. Hattersley\r\nspends much of his time at Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s bed-side. With more good feeling\r\nthan I gave him credit for, he evinces considerable sympathy for his\r\nunhappy friend, and is far more willing than able to comfort him.\r\nSometimes he tries to joke and laugh with him, but that will not do;\r\nsometimes he endeavours to cheer him with talk about old times, and\r\nthis at one time may serve to divert the sufferer from his own sad\r\nthoughts; at another, it will only plunge him into deeper melancholy\r\nthan before; and then Hattersley is confounded, and knows not what to\r\nsay, unless it be a timid suggestion that the clergyman might be sent\r\nfor. But Arthur will never consent to that: he knows he has rejected\r\nthe clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s well-meant admonitions with scoffing levity at other\r\ntimes, and cannot dream of turning to him for consolation now.\r\n\r\nMr. Hattersley sometimes offers his services instead of mine, but\r\nArthur will not let me go: that strange whim still increases, as his\r\nstrength declines\xe2\x80\x94the fancy to have me always by his side. I hardly\r\never leave him, except to go into the next room, where I sometimes\r\nsnatch an hour or so of sleep when he is quiet; but even then the door\r\nis left ajar, that he may know me to be within call. I am with him now,\r\nwhile I write, and I fear my occupation annoys him; though I frequently\r\nbreak off to attend to him, and though Mr. Hattersley is also by his\r\nside. That gentleman came, as he said, to beg a holiday for me, that I\r\nmight have a run in the park, this fine frosty morning, with Milicent\r\nand Esther and little Arthur, whom he had driven over to see me. Our\r\npoor invalid evidently felt it a heartless proposition, and would have\r\nfelt it still more heartless in me to accede to it. I therefore said I\r\nwould only go and speak to them a minute, and then come back. I did but\r\nexchange a few words with them, just outside the portico, inhaling the\r\nfresh, bracing air as I stood, and then, resisting the earnest and\r\neloquent entreaties of all three to stay a little longer, and join them\r\nin a walk round the garden, I tore myself away and returned to my\r\npatient. I had not been absent five minutes, but he reproached me\r\nbitterly for my levity and neglect. His friend espoused my cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re too hard upon her; she must\r\nhave food and sleep, and a mouthful of fresh air now and then, or she\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand it, I tell you. Look at her, man! she\xe2\x80\x99s worn to a shadow\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are her sufferings to mine?\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor invalid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngrudge me these attentions, do you, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Arthur, if I could really serve you by them. I would give my life\r\nto save you, if I might.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you, _indeed?_ No!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost willingly I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s because you think yourself more fit to die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a painful pause. He was evidently plunged in gloomy\r\nreflections; but while I pondered for something to say that might\r\nbenefit without alarming him, Hattersley, whose mind had been pursuing\r\nalmost the same course, broke silence with, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Huntingdon, I\r\n_would_ send for a parson of some sort: if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the vicar,\r\nyou know, you could have his curate, or somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; none of them can benefit me if _she_ can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. And\r\nthe tears gushed from his eyes as he earnestly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Helen,\r\nif I had listened to you, it never would have come to this! and if I\r\nhad heard you long ago\xe2\x80\x94oh, God! how different it would have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me now, then, Arthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, gently pressing his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he despondingly. And after that another\r\nparoxysm of pain came on; and then his mind began to wander, and we\r\nfeared his death was approaching: but an opiate was administered: his\r\nsufferings began to abate, he gradually became more composed, and at\r\nlength sank into a kind of slumber. He has been quieter since; and now\r\nHattersley has left him, expressing a hope that he shall find him\r\nbetter when he calls to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I _may_ recover,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cwho knows? This may have been\r\nthe crisis. What do _you_ think, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnwilling to depress him, I gave the most cheering answer I could, but\r\nstill recommended him to prepare for the possibility of what I inly\r\nfeared was but too certain. But he was determined to hope. Shortly\r\nafter he relapsed into a kind of doze, but now he groans again.\r\n\r\nThere is a change. Suddenly he called me to his side, with such a\r\nstrange, excited manner, that I feared he was delirious, but he was\r\nnot. \xe2\x80\x9cThat _was_ the crisis, Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, delightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI had an\r\ninfernal pain here\xe2\x80\x94it is quite gone now. I never was so easy since the\r\nfall\xe2\x80\x94quite gone, by heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d and he clasped and kissed my hand in the\r\nvery fulness of his heart; but finding I did not participate in his\r\njoy, he quickly flung it from him, and bitterly cursed my coldness and\r\ninsensibility. How could I reply? Kneeling beside him, I took his hand\r\nand fondly pressed it to my lips\xe2\x80\x94for the first time since our\r\nseparation\xe2\x80\x94and told him, as well as tears would let me speak, that it\r\nwas not _that_ that kept me silent: it was the fear that this sudden\r\ncessation of pain was not so favourable a symptom as he supposed. I\r\nimmediately sent for the doctor: we are now anxiously awaiting him. I\r\nwill tell you what he says. There is still the same freedom from pain,\r\nthe same deadness to all sensation where the suffering was most acute.\r\n\r\nMy worst fears are realised: mortification has commenced. The doctor\r\nhas told him there is no hope. No words can describe his anguish. I can\r\nwrite no more.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next was still more distressing in the tenor of its contents. The\r\nsufferer was fast approaching dissolution\xe2\x80\x94dragged almost to the verge\r\nof that awful chasm he trembled to contemplate, from which no agony of\r\nprayers or tears could save him. Nothing could comfort him now;\r\nHattersley\xe2\x80\x99s rough attempts at consolation were utterly in vain. The\r\nworld was nothing to him: life and all its interests, its petty cares\r\nand transient pleasures, were a cruel mockery. To talk of the past was\r\nto torture him with vain remorse; to refer to the future was to\r\nincrease his anguish; and yet to be silent was to leave him a prey to\r\nhis own regrets and apprehensions. Often he dwelt with shuddering\r\nminuteness on the fate of his perishing clay\xe2\x80\x94the slow, piecemeal\r\ndissolution already invading his frame: the shroud, the coffin, the\r\ndark, lonely grave, and all the horrors of corruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I try,\xe2\x80\x9d said his afflicted wife, \xe2\x80\x9cto divert him from these\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94to raise his thoughts to higher themes, it is no better:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Worse\r\nand worse!\xe2\x80\x99 he groans. \xe2\x80\x98If there be really life beyond the tomb, and\r\njudgment after death, how _can_ I face it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I cannot do him any good;\r\nhe will neither be enlightened, nor roused, nor comforted by anything I\r\nsay; and yet he clings to me with unrelenting pertinacity\xe2\x80\x94with a kind\r\nof childish desperation, as if _I_ could save him from the fate he\r\ndreads. He keeps me night and day beside him. He is holding my left\r\nhand now, while I write; he has held it thus for hours: sometimes\r\nquietly, with his pale face upturned to mine: sometimes clutching my\r\narm with violence\xe2\x80\x94the big drops starting from his forehead at the\r\nthoughts of what he sees, or thinks he sees, before him. If I withdraw\r\nmy hand for a moment it distresses him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Stay with me, Helen,\xe2\x80\x99 he says; \xe2\x80\x98let me hold you so: it seems as if\r\nharm could not reach me while you are here. But death _will_ come\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\ncoming now\xe2\x80\x94fast, fast!\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94oh, if I _could_ believe there was nothing\r\nafter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to believe it, Arthur; there is joy and glory after, if you\r\nwill but try to reach it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What, for _me?_\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with something like a laugh. \xe2\x80\x98Are we not to\r\nbe judged according to the deeds done in the body? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the use of a\r\nprobationary existence, if a man may spend it as he pleases, just\r\ncontrary to God\xe2\x80\x99s decrees, and then go to heaven with the best\xe2\x80\x94if the\r\nvilest sinner may win the reward of the holiest saint, by merely\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98I repent!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But if you _sincerely_ repent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ repent; I only fear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You only regret the past for its consequences to yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Just so\xe2\x80\x94except that I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to have wronged you, Nell, because\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re so good to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Think of the goodness of God, and you cannot but be grieved to have\r\noffended Him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What _is_ God?\xe2\x80\x94I cannot see Him or hear Him.\xe2\x80\x94God is only an idea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98God is Infinite Wisdom, and Power, and Goodness\xe2\x80\x94and LOVE; but if this\r\nidea is too vast for your human faculties\xe2\x80\x94if your mind loses itself in\r\nits overwhelming infinitude, fix it on Him who condescended to take our\r\nnature upon Him, who was raised to heaven even in His glorified human\r\nbody, in whom the fulness of the Godhead shines.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he only shook his head and sighed. Then, in another paroxysm of\r\nshuddering horror, he tightened his grasp on my hand and arm, and,\r\ngroaning and lamenting, still clung to me with that wild, desperate\r\nearnestness so harrowing to my soul, because I know I cannot help him.\r\nI did my best to soothe and comfort him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Death is so terrible,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot bear it! _You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\nHelen\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what it is, because you haven\xe2\x80\x99t it before you!\r\nand when I\xe2\x80\x99m buried, you\xe2\x80\x99ll return to your old ways and be as happy as\r\never, and all the world will go on just as busy and merry as if I had\r\nnever been; while I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 He burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t let _that_ distress you,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98we shall all follow\r\nyou soon enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I wish to God I could take you with me now!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nshould plead for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No man can deliver his brother, nor make agreement unto God for him,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI replied: \xe2\x80\x98it cost more to redeem their souls\xe2\x80\x94it cost the blood of an\r\nincarnate God, perfect and sinless in Himself, to redeem us from the\r\nbondage of the evil one:\xe2\x80\x94let _Him_ plead for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I seem to speak in vain. He does not now, as formerly, laugh these\r\nblessed truths to scorn: but still he cannot trust, or will not\r\ncomprehend them. He cannot linger long. He suffers dreadfully, and so\r\ndo those that wait upon him. But I will not harass you with further\r\ndetails: I have said enough, I think, to convince you that I did well\r\nto go to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor, poor Helen! dreadful indeed her trials must have been! And I\r\ncould do nothing to lessen them\xe2\x80\x94nay, it almost seemed as if I had\r\nbrought them upon her myself by my own secret desires; and whether I\r\nlooked at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings or her own, it seemed almost like a\r\njudgment upon myself for having cherished such a wish.\r\n\r\nThe next day but one there came another letter. That too was put into\r\nmy hands without a remark, and these are its contents:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nDec. 5th.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is gone at last. I sat beside him all night, with my hand fast\r\nlocked in his, watching the changes of his features and listening to\r\nhis failing breath. He had been silent a long time, and I thought he\r\nwould never speak again, when he murmured, faintly but\r\ndistinctly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPray for me, Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do pray for you, every hour and every minute, Arthur; but you must\r\npray for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis lips moved, but emitted no sound;\xe2\x80\x94then his looks became unsettled;\r\nand, from the incoherent, half-uttered words that escaped him from time\r\nto time, supposing him to be now unconscious, I gently disengaged my\r\nhand from his, intending to steal away for a breath of air, for I was\r\nalmost ready to faint; but a convulsive movement of the fingers, and a\r\nfaintly whispered \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d immediately recalled me: I took his\r\nhand again, and held it till he was no more\xe2\x80\x94and then I fainted. It was\r\nnot grief; it was exhaustion, that, till then, I had been enabled\r\nsuccessfully to combat. Oh, Frederick! none can imagine the miseries,\r\nbodily and mental, of that death-bed! How could I endure to think that\r\nthat poor trembling soul was hurried away to everlasting torment? it\r\nwould drive me mad. But, thank God, I have hope\xe2\x80\x94not only from a vague\r\ndependence on the possibility that penitence and pardon might have\r\nreached him at the last, but from the blessed confidence that, through\r\nwhatever purging fires the erring spirit may be doomed to pass\xe2\x80\x94whatever\r\nfate awaits it\xe2\x80\x94still it is not lost, and God, who hateth nothing that\r\nHe hath made, _will_ bless it in the end!\r\n\r\nHis body will be consigned on Thursday to that dark grave he so much\r\ndreaded; but the coffin must be closed as soon as possible. If you will\r\nattend the funeral, come quickly, for I need help.\r\n\r\nHELEN HUNTINGDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER L\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reading this I had no reason to disguise my joy and hope from\r\nFrederick Lawrence, for I had none to be ashamed of. I felt no joy but\r\nthat his sister was at length released from her afflictive,\r\noverwhelming toil\xe2\x80\x94no hope but that she would in time recover from the\r\neffects of it, and be suffered to rest in peace and quietness, at\r\nleast, for the remainder of her life. I experienced a painful\r\ncommiseration for her unhappy husband (though fully aware that he had\r\nbrought every particle of his sufferings upon himself, and but too well\r\ndeserved them all), and a profound sympathy for her own afflictions,\r\nand deep anxiety for the consequences of those harassing cares, those\r\ndreadful vigils, that incessant and deleterious confinement beside a\r\nliving corpse\xe2\x80\x94for I was persuaded she had not hinted half the\r\nsufferings she had had to endure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will go to her, Lawrence?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as I put the letter into his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right! I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you, then, to prepare for your departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done that already, while you were reading the letter, and before\r\nyou came; and the carriage is now coming round to the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInly approving his promptitude, I bade him good-morning, and withdrew.\r\nHe gave me a searching glance as we pressed each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands at\r\nparting; but whatever he sought in my countenance, he saw there nothing\r\nbut the most becoming gravity\xe2\x80\x94it might be mingled with a little\r\nsternness in momentary resentment at what I suspected to be passing in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nHad I forgotten my own prospects, my ardent love, my pertinacious\r\nhopes? It seemed like sacrilege to revert to them now, but I had not\r\nforgotten them. It was, however, with a gloomy sense of the darkness of\r\nthose prospects, the fallacy of those hopes, and the vanity of that\r\naffection, that I reflected on those things as I remounted my horse and\r\nslowly journeyed homewards. Mrs. Huntingdon was free now; it was no\r\nlonger a crime to think of her\xe2\x80\x94but did she ever think of _me?_ Not\r\n_now_\xe2\x80\x94of course it was not to be expected\xe2\x80\x94but would she when this shock\r\nwas over? In all the course of her correspondence with her brother (our\r\nmutual friend, as she herself had called him) she had never mentioned\r\nme but once\xe2\x80\x94and that was from necessity. This alone afforded strong\r\npresumption that I was already forgotten; yet this was not the worst:\r\nit might have been her sense of duty that had kept her silent: she\r\nmight be only _trying_ to forget; but in addition to this, I had a\r\ngloomy conviction that the awful realities she had seen and felt, her\r\nreconciliation with the man she had once loved, his dreadful sufferings\r\nand death, must eventually efface from her mind all traces of her\r\npassing love for me. She might recover from these horrors so far as to\r\nbe restored to her former health, her tranquillity, her cheerfulness\r\neven\xe2\x80\x94but never to those feelings which would appear to her, henceforth,\r\nas a fleeting fancy, a vain, illusive dream; especially as there was no\r\none to remind her of my existence\xe2\x80\x94no means of assuring her of my\r\nfervent constancy, now that we were so far apart, and delicacy forbade\r\nme to see her or to write to her, for months to come at least. And how\r\ncould I engage her brother in my behalf? how could I break that icy\r\ncrust of shy reserve? Perhaps he would disapprove of my attachment now\r\nas highly as before; perhaps he would think me too poor\xe2\x80\x94too lowly born,\r\nto match with his sister. Yes, there was another barrier: doubtless\r\nthere was a wide distinction between the rank and circumstances of Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon, the lady of Grassdale Manor, and those of Mrs. Graham, the\r\nartist, the tenant of Wildfell Hall. And it might be deemed presumption\r\nin me to offer my hand to the former, by the world, by her friends, if\r\nnot by herself; a penalty I might brave, if I were certain she loved\r\nme; but otherwise, how could I? And, finally, her deceased husband,\r\nwith his usual selfishness, might have so constructed his will as to\r\nplace restrictions upon her marrying again. So that you see I had\r\nreasons enough for despair if I chose to indulge it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was with no small degree of impatience that I looked\r\nforward to Mr. Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s return from Grassdale: impatience that\r\nincreased in proportion as his absence was prolonged. He stayed away\r\nsome ten or twelve days. All very right that he should remain to\r\ncomfort and help his sister, but he might have written to tell me how\r\nshe was, or at least to tell me when to expect his return; for he might\r\nhave known I was suffering tortures of anxiety for her, and uncertainty\r\nfor my own future prospects. And when he did return, all he told me\r\nabout her was, that she had been greatly exhausted and worn by her\r\nunremitting exertions in behalf of that man who had been the scourge of\r\nher life, and had dragged her with him nearly to the portals of the\r\ngrave, and was still much shaken and depressed by his melancholy end\r\nand the circumstances attendant upon it; but no word in reference to\r\nme; no intimation that my name had ever passed her lips, or even been\r\nspoken in her presence. To be sure, I asked no questions on the\r\nsubject; I could not bring my mind to do so, believing, as I did, that\r\nLawrence was indeed averse to the idea of my union with his sister.\r\n\r\nI saw that he expected to be further questioned concerning his visit,\r\nand I saw too, with the keen perception of awakened jealousy, or\r\nalarmed self-esteem, or by whatever name I ought to call it, that he\r\nrather shrank from that impending scrutiny, and was no less pleased\r\nthan surprised to find it did not come. Of course, I was burning with\r\nanger, but pride obliged me to suppress my feelings, and preserve a\r\nsmooth face, or at least a stoic calmness, throughout the interview. It\r\nwas well it did, for, reviewing the matter in my sober judgment, I must\r\nsay it would have been highly absurd and improper to have quarrelled\r\nwith him on such an occasion. I must confess, too, that I wronged him\r\nin my heart: the truth was, he liked me very well, but he was fully\r\naware that a union between Mrs. Huntingdon and me would be what the\r\nworld calls a m\xc3\xa9salliance; and it was not in his nature to set the\r\nworld at defiance; especially in such a case as this, for its dread\r\nlaugh, or ill opinion, would be far more terrible to him directed\r\nagainst his sister than himself. Had he believed that a union was\r\nnecessary to the happiness of both, or of either, or had he known how\r\nfervently I loved her, he would have acted differently; but seeing me\r\nso calm and cool, he would not for the world disturb my philosophy; and\r\nthough refraining entirely from any active opposition to the match, he\r\nwould yet do nothing to bring it about, and would much rather take the\r\npart of prudence, in aiding us to overcome our mutual predilections,\r\nthan that of feeling, to encourage them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was in the right of\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d you will say. Perhaps he was; at any rate, I had no business to\r\nfeel so bitterly against him as I did; but I could not then regard the\r\nmatter in such a moderate light; and, after a brief conversation upon\r\nindifferent topics, I went away, suffering all the pangs of wounded\r\npride and injured friendship, in addition to those resulting from the\r\nfear that I was indeed forgotten, and the knowledge that she I loved\r\nwas alone and afflicted, suffering from injured health and dejected\r\nspirits, and I was forbidden to console or assist her: forbidden even\r\nto assure her of my sympathy, for the transmission of any such message\r\nthrough Mr. Lawrence was now completely out of the question.\r\n\r\nBut what should I do? I would wait, and see if she would notice me,\r\nwhich of course she would not, unless by some kind message intrusted to\r\nher brother, that, in all probability, he would not deliver, and then,\r\ndreadful thought! she would think me cooled and changed for not\r\nreturning it, or, perhaps, he had already given her to understand that\r\nI had ceased to think of her. I would wait, however, till the six\r\nmonths after our parting were fairly passed (which would be about the\r\nclose of February), and then I would send her a letter, modestly\r\nreminding her of her former permission to write to her at the close of\r\nthat period, and hoping I might avail myself of it\xe2\x80\x94at least to express\r\nmy heartfelt sorrow for her late afflictions, my just appreciation of\r\nher generous conduct, and my hope that her health was now completely\r\nre-established, and that she would, some time, be permitted to enjoy\r\nthose blessings of a peaceful, happy life, which had been denied her so\r\nlong, but which none could more truly be said to merit than\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94adding a few words of kind remembrance to my little friend\r\nArthur, with a hope that he had not forgotten me, and perhaps a few\r\nmore in reference to bygone times, to the delightful hours I had passed\r\nin her society, and my unfading recollection of them, which was the\r\nsalt and solace of my life, and a hope that her recent troubles had not\r\nentirely banished me from her mind. If she did not answer this, of\r\ncourse I should write no more: if she did (as surely she would, in some\r\nfashion), my future proceedings should be regulated by her reply.\r\n\r\nTen weeks was long to wait in such a miserable state of uncertainty;\r\nbut courage! it must be endured! and meantime I would continue to see\r\nLawrence now and then, though not so often as before, and I would still\r\npursue my habitual inquiries after his sister, if he had lately heard\r\nfrom her, and how she was, but nothing more.\r\n\r\nI did so, and the answers I received were always provokingly limited to\r\nthe letter of the inquiry: she was much as usual: she made no\r\ncomplaints, but the tone of her last letter evinced great depression of\r\nmind: she said she was better: and, finally, she said she was well, and\r\nvery busy with her son\xe2\x80\x99s education, and with the management of her late\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s property, and the regulation of his affairs. The rascal had\r\nnever told me how that property was disposed, or whether Mr. Huntingdon\r\nhad died intestate or not; and I would sooner die than ask him, lest he\r\nshould misconstrue into covetousness my desire to know. He never\r\noffered to show me his sister\xe2\x80\x99s letters now, and I never hinted a wish\r\nto see them. February, however, was approaching; December was past;\r\nJanuary, at length, was almost over\xe2\x80\x94a few more weeks, and then, certain\r\ndespair or renewal of hope would put an end to this long agony of\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\nBut alas! it was just about that time she was called to sustain another\r\nblow in the death of her uncle\xe2\x80\x94a worthless old fellow enough in\r\nhimself, I daresay, but he had always shown more kindness and affection\r\nto her than to any other creature, and she had always been accustomed\r\nto regard him as a parent. She was with him when he died, and had\r\nassisted her aunt to nurse him during the last stage of his illness.\r\nHer brother went to Staningley to attend the funeral, and told me, upon\r\nhis return, that she was still there, endeavouring to cheer her aunt\r\nwith her presence, and likely to remain some time. This was bad news\r\nfor me, for while she continued there I could not write to her, as I\r\ndid not know the address, and would not ask it of him. But week\r\nfollowed week, and every time I inquired about her she was still at\r\nStaningley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere _is_ Staningley?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94shire,\xe2\x80\x9d was the brief reply; and there was something so cold and\r\ndry in the manner of it, that I was effectually deterred from\r\nrequesting a more definite account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will she return to Grassdale?\xe2\x80\x9d was my next question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it!\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my companion, with an air of innocent surprise.\r\nBut I did not deign to answer him, save by a look of silent, sullen\r\ncontempt, at which he turned away, and contemplated the carpet with a\r\nslight smile, half pensive, half amused; but quickly looking up, he\r\nbegan to talk of other subjects, trying to draw me into a cheerful and\r\nfriendly conversation, but I was too much irritated to discourse with\r\nhim, and soon took leave.\r\n\r\nYou see Lawrence and I somehow could not manage to get on very well\r\ntogether. The fact is, I believe, we were both of us a little too\r\ntouchy. It is a troublesome thing, Halford, this susceptibility to\r\naffronts where none are intended. I am no martyr to it now, as you can\r\nbear me witness: I have learned to be merry and wise, to be more easy\r\nwith myself and more indulgent to my neighbours, and I can afford to\r\nlaugh at both Lawrence and you.\r\n\r\nPartly from accident, partly from wilful negligence on my part (for I\r\nwas really beginning to dislike him), several weeks elapsed before I\r\nsaw my friend again. When we did meet, it was _he_ that sought _me_\r\nout. One bright morning, early in June, he came into the field, where I\r\nwas just commencing my hay harvest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is long since I saw you, Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after the first few\r\nwords had passed between us. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you never mean to come to Woodford\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called once, and you were out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sorry, but that was long since; I hoped you would call again,\r\nand now _I_ have called, and _you_ were out, which you generally are,\r\nor I would do myself the pleasure of calling more frequently; but being\r\ndetermined to see you this time, I have left my pony in the lane, and\r\ncome over hedge and ditch to join you; for I am about to leave Woodford\r\nfor a while, and may not have the pleasure of seeing you again for a\r\nmonth or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Grassdale first,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a half-smile he would willingly\r\nhave suppressed if he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Grassdale! Is she there, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but in a day or two she will leave it to accompany Mrs. Maxwell\r\nto F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 for the benefit of the sea air, and I shall go with them.\xe2\x80\x9d (F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\nwas at that time a quiet but respectable watering-place: it is\r\nconsiderably more frequented now.)\r\n\r\nLawrence seemed to expect me to take advantage of this circumstance to\r\nentrust him with some sort of a message to his sister; and I believe he\r\nwould have undertaken to deliver it without any material objections, if\r\nI had had the sense to ask him, though of course he would not _offer_\r\nto do so, if I was content to let it alone. But I could not bring\r\nmyself to make the request, and it was not till after he was gone, that\r\nI saw how fair an opportunity I had lost; and then, indeed, I deeply\r\nregretted my stupidity and my foolish pride, but it was now too late to\r\nremedy the evil.\r\n\r\nHe did not return till towards the latter end of August. He wrote to me\r\ntwice or thrice from F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, but his letters were most provokingly\r\nunsatisfactory, dealing in generalities or in trifles that I cared\r\nnothing about, or replete with fancies and reflections equally\r\nunwelcome to me at the time, saying next to nothing about his sister,\r\nand little more about himself. I would wait, however, till he came\r\nback; perhaps I could get something more out of him then. At all\r\nevents, I would not write to her now, while she was with him and her\r\naunt, who doubtless would be still more hostile to my presumptuous\r\naspirations than himself. When she was returned to the silence and\r\nsolitude of her own home, it would be my fittest opportunity.\r\n\r\nWhen Lawrence came, however, he was as reserved as ever on the subject\r\nof my keen anxiety. He told me that his sister had derived considerable\r\nbenefit from her stay at F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 that her son was quite well, and\xe2\x80\x94alas!\r\nthat both of them were gone, with Mrs. Maxwell, back to Staningley, and\r\nthere they stayed at least three months. But instead of boring you with\r\nmy chagrin, my expectations and disappointments, my fluctuations of\r\ndull despondency and flickering hope, my varying resolutions, now to\r\ndrop it, and now to persevere\xe2\x80\x94now to make a bold push, and now to let\r\nthings pass and patiently abide my time,\xe2\x80\x94I will employ myself in\r\nsettling the business of one or two of the characters introduced in the\r\ncourse of this narrative, whom I may not have occasion to mention\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSome time before Mr. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x99s death Lady Lowborough eloped with\r\nanother gallant to the Continent, where, having lived a while in\r\nreckless gaiety and dissipation, they quarrelled and parted. She went\r\ndashing on for a season, but years came and money went: she sunk, at\r\nlength, in difficulty and debt, disgrace and misery; and died at last,\r\nas I have heard, in penury, neglect, and utter wretchedness. But this\r\nmight be only a report: she may be living yet for anything I or any of\r\nher relatives or former acquaintances can tell; for they have all lost\r\nsight of her long years ago, and would as thoroughly forget her if they\r\ncould. Her husband, however, upon this second misdemeanour, immediately\r\nsought and obtained a divorce, and, not long after, married again. It\r\nwas well he did, for Lord Lowborough, morose and moody as he seemed,\r\nwas not the man for a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s life. No public interests, no\r\nambitious projects, or active pursuits,\xe2\x80\x94or ties of friendship even (if\r\nhe had had any friends), could compensate to him for the absence of\r\ndomestic comforts and endearments. He had a son and a nominal daughter,\r\nit is true, but they too painfully reminded him of their mother, and\r\nthe unfortunate little Annabella was a source of perpetual bitterness\r\nto his soul. He had obliged himself to treat her with paternal\r\nkindness: he had forced himself not to hate her, and even, perhaps, to\r\nfeel some degree of kindly regard for her, at last, in return for her\r\nartless and unsuspecting attachment to himself; but the bitterness of\r\nhis self-condemnation for his inward feelings towards that innocent\r\nbeing, his constant struggles to subdue the evil promptings of his\r\nnature (for it was not a generous one), though partly guessed at by\r\nthose who knew him, could be known to God and his own heart alone;\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nalso was the hardness of his conflicts with the temptation to return to\r\nthe vice of his youth, and seek oblivion for past calamities, and\r\ndeadness to the present misery of a blighted heart a joyless,\r\nfriendless life, and a morbidly disconsolate mind, by yielding again to\r\nthat insidious foe to health, and sense, and virtue, which had so\r\ndeplorably enslaved and degraded him before.\r\n\r\nThe second object of his choice was widely different from the first.\r\nSome wondered at his taste; some even ridiculed it\xe2\x80\x94but in this their\r\nfolly was more apparent than his. The lady was about his own\r\nage\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._, between thirty and forty\xe2\x80\x94remarkable neither for beauty, nor\r\nwealth, nor brilliant accomplishments; nor any other thing that I ever\r\nheard of, except genuine good sense, unswerving integrity, active\r\npiety, warm-hearted benevolence, and a fund of cheerful spirits. These\r\nqualities, however, as you may readily imagine, combined to render her\r\nan excellent mother to the children, and an invaluable wife to his\r\nlordship. _He_, with his usual self-depreciation, thought her a world\r\ntoo good for him, and while he wondered at the kindness of Providence\r\nin conferring such a gift upon him, and even at her taste in preferring\r\nhim to other men, he did his best to reciprocate the good she did him,\r\nand so far succeeded that she was, and I believe still is, one of the\r\nhappiest and fondest wives in England; and all who question the good\r\ntaste of either partner may be thankful if _their_ respective\r\nselections afford them half the genuine satisfaction in the end, or\r\nrepay their preference with affection half as lasting and sincere.\r\n\r\nIf you are at all interested in the fate of that low scoundrel,\r\nGrimsby, I can only tell you that he went from bad to worse, sinking\r\nfrom bathos to bathos of vice and villainy, consorting only with the\r\nworst members of his club and the lowest dregs of society\xe2\x80\x94happily for\r\nthe rest of the world\xe2\x80\x94and at last met his end in a drunken brawl, from\r\nthe hands, it is said, of some brother scoundrel he had cheated at\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Hattersley, he had never wholly forgotten his resolution to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome out from among them,\xe2\x80\x9d and behave like a man and a Christian, and\r\nthe last illness and death of his once jolly friend Huntingdon so\r\ndeeply and seriously impressed him with the evil of their former\r\npractices, that he never needed another lesson of the kind. Avoiding\r\nthe temptations of the town, he continued to pass his life in the\r\ncountry, immersed in the usual pursuits of a hearty, active, country\r\ngentleman; his occupations being those of farming, and breeding horses\r\nand cattle, diversified with a little hunting and shooting, and\r\nenlivened by the occasional companionship of his friends (better\r\nfriends than those of his youth), and the society of his happy little\r\nwife (now cheerful and confiding as heart could wish), and his fine\r\nfamily of stalwart sons and blooming daughters. His father, the banker,\r\nhaving died some years ago and left him all his riches, he has now full\r\nscope for the exercise of his prevailing tastes, and I need not tell\r\nyou that Ralph Hattersley, Esq., is celebrated throughout the country\r\nfor his noble breed of horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to a certain still, cold, cloudy afternoon about the\r\ncommencement of December, when the first fall of snow lay thinly\r\nscattered over the blighted fields and frozen roads, or stored more\r\nthickly in the hollows of the deep cart-ruts and footsteps of men and\r\nhorses impressed in the now petrified mire of last month\xe2\x80\x99s drenching\r\nrains. I remember it well, for I was walking home from the vicarage\r\nwith no less remarkable a personage than Miss Eliza Millward by my\r\nside. I had been to call upon her father,\xe2\x80\x94a sacrifice to civility\r\nundertaken entirely to please my mother, not myself, for I hated to go\r\nnear the house; not merely on account of my antipathy to the once so\r\nbewitching Eliza, but because I had not half forgiven the old gentleman\r\nhimself for his ill opinion of Mrs. Huntingdon; for though now\r\nconstrained to acknowledge himself mistaken in his former judgment, he\r\nstill maintained that she had done wrong to leave her husband; it was a\r\nviolation of her sacred duties as a wife, and a tempting of Providence\r\nby laying herself open to temptation; and nothing short of bodily\r\nill-usage (and that of no trifling nature) could excuse such a step\xe2\x80\x94nor\r\neven that, for in such a case she ought to appeal to the laws for\r\nprotection. But it was not of him I intended to speak; it was of his\r\ndaughter Eliza. Just as I was taking leave of the vicar, she entered\r\nthe room, ready equipped for a walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just coming to see your sister, Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cand so,\r\nif you have no objection, I\xe2\x80\x99ll accompany you home. I like company when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m walking out\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when it\xe2\x80\x99s agreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat of course,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the young lady, smiling archly.\r\n\r\nSo we proceeded together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I find Rose at home, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as we closed the\r\ngarden gate, and set our faces towards Linden-Car.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust I shall, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve a little bit of news for her\xe2\x80\x94if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforestalled me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: do you know what Mr. Lawrence is gone for?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked up\r\nanxiously for my reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and her face brightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! then he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told you about his sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d I demanded in terror, lest some evil should have\r\nbefallen her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Markham, how you blush!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, with a tormenting laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, you have not forgotten her yet. But you had better be quick\r\nabout it, I can tell you, for\xe2\x80\x94alas, alas!\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s going to be married\r\nnext Thursday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss Eliza, that\xe2\x80\x99s false.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you charge me with a falsehood, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are misinformed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I? Do you know better, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you look so pale then?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling with delight at\r\nmy emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it anger at poor me for telling such a fib? Well, I\r\nonly \xe2\x80\x98tell the tale as \xe2\x80\x99twas told to me:\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t vouch for the truth\r\nof it; but at the same time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what reason Sarah should have\r\nfor deceiving me, or her informant for deceiving her; and that was what\r\nshe told me the footman told her:\xe2\x80\x94that Mrs. Huntingdon was going to be\r\nmarried on Thursday, and Mr. Lawrence was gone to the wedding. She did\r\ntell me the name of the gentleman, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten that. Perhaps you\r\ncan assist me to remember it. Is there not some one that lives near\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nfrequently visits the neighbourhood, that has long been attached to\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x94a Mr.\xe2\x80\x94oh, dear! Mr.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHargrave?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested I, with a bitter smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she; \xe2\x80\x9cthat was the very name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, Miss Eliza!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, in a tone that made her start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they told me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, composedly\r\nstaring me in the face. And then she broke out into a long shrill laugh\r\nthat put me to my wit\xe2\x80\x99s end with fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally you must excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s very rude, but ha,\r\nha, ha!\xe2\x80\x94did you think to marry her yourself? Dear, dear, what a\r\npity!\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha, ha! Gracious, Mr. Markham, are you going to faint? Oh,\r\nmercy! shall I call this man? Here, Jacob\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But checking the word on\r\nher lips, I seized her arm and gave it, I think, a pretty severe\r\nsqueeze, for she shrank into herself with a faint cry of pain or\r\nterror; but the spirit within her was not subdued: instantly rallying,\r\nshe continued, with well-feigned concern, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you? Will\r\nyou have some water\xe2\x80\x94some brandy? I daresay they have some in the\r\npublic-house down there, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done with this nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, sternly. She looked\r\nconfounded\xe2\x80\x94almost frightened again, for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I hate such\r\njests,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Jests_ indeed! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t _jesting!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were laughing, at all events; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be laughed at,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned I, making violent efforts to speak with proper dignity and\r\ncomposure, and to say nothing but what was coherent and sensible. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nsince you are in such a merry mood, Miss Eliza, you must be good enough\r\ncompany for yourself; and therefore I shall leave you to finish your\r\nwalk alone\xe2\x80\x94for, now I think of it, I have business elsewhere; so\r\ngood-evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that I left her (smothering her malicious laughter) and turned\r\naside into the fields, springing up the bank, and pushing through the\r\nnearest gap in the hedge. Determined at once to prove the truth\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nrather the falsehood\xe2\x80\x94of her story, I hastened to Woodford as fast as my\r\nlegs could carry me; first veering round by a circuitous course, but\r\nthe moment I was out of sight of my fair tormentor cutting away across\r\nthe country, just as a bird might fly, over pasture-land, and fallow,\r\nand stubble, and lane, clearing hedges and ditches and hurdles, till I\r\ncame to the young squire\xe2\x80\x99s gates. Never till now had I known the full\r\nfervour of my love\xe2\x80\x94the full strength of my hopes, not wholly crushed\r\neven in my hours of deepest despondency, always tenaciously clinging to\r\nthe thought that one day she might be mine, or, if not that, at least\r\nthat something of my memory, some slight remembrance of our friendship\r\nand our love, would be for ever cherished in her heart. I marched up to\r\nthe door, determined, if I saw the master, to question him boldly\r\nconcerning his sister, to wait and hesitate no longer, but cast false\r\ndelicacy and stupid pride behind my back, and know my fate at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Lawrence at home?\xe2\x80\x9d I eagerly asked of the servant that opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, master went yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, looking very alert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWent where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Grassdale, sir\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t you aware, sir? He\xe2\x80\x99s very close, is master,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the fellow, with a foolish, simpering grin. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I turned and left him, without waiting to hear what he supposed. I\r\nwas not going to stand there to expose my tortured feelings to the\r\ninsolent laughter and impertinent curiosity of a fellow like that.\r\n\r\nBut what was to be done now? Could it be possible that she had left me\r\nfor _that_ man? I could not believe it. Me she might forsake, but _not_\r\nto give herself to him! Well, I would know the truth; to no concerns of\r\ndaily life could I attend while this tempest of doubt and dread, of\r\njealousy and rage, distracted me. I would take the morning coach from\r\nL\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 (the evening one would be already gone), and fly to Grassdale\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n_must_ be there before the marriage. And why? Because a thought struck\r\nme that _perhaps_ I might prevent it\xe2\x80\x94that if I did not, she and I might\r\nboth lament it to the latest moment of our lives. It struck me that\r\nsomeone might have belied me to her: perhaps her brother; yes, no doubt\r\nher brother had persuaded her that I was false and faithless, and\r\ntaking advantage of her natural indignation, and perhaps her desponding\r\ncarelessness about her future life, had urged her, artfully, cruelly,\r\non to this other marriage, in order to secure her from me. If this\r\n_was_ the case, and if she should only discover her mistake when too\r\nlate to repair it\xe2\x80\x94to what a life of misery and vain regret might she be\r\ndoomed as well as me; and what remorse for me to think my foolish\r\nscruples had induced it all! Oh, I _must_ see her\xe2\x80\x94she must know my\r\ntruth even if I told it at the church door! I might pass for a madman\r\nor an impertinent fool\xe2\x80\x94even she might be offended at such an\r\ninterruption, or at least might tell me it was now too late. But if I\r\n_could_ save her, if she _might_ be mine!\xe2\x80\x94it was too rapturous a\r\nthought!\r\n\r\nWinged by this hope, and goaded by these fears, I hurried homewards to\r\nprepare for my departure on the morrow. I told my mother that urgent\r\nbusiness which admitted no delay, but which I could not then explain,\r\ncalled me away.\r\n\r\nMy deep anxiety and serious preoccupation could not be concealed from\r\nher maternal eyes; and I had much ado to calm her apprehensions of some\r\ndisastrous mystery.\r\n\r\nThat night there came a heavy fall of snow, which so retarded the\r\nprogress of the coaches on the following day that I was almost driven\r\nto distraction. I travelled all night, of course, for this was\r\nWednesday: to-morrow morning, doubtless, the marriage would take place.\r\nBut the night was long and dark: the snow heavily clogged the wheels\r\nand balled the horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet; the animals were consumedly lazy; the\r\ncoachman most execrably cautious; the passengers confoundedly apathetic\r\nin their supine indifference to the rate of our progression. Instead of\r\nassisting me to bully the several coachmen and urge them forward, they\r\nmerely stared and grinned at my impatience: one fellow even ventured to\r\nrally me upon it\xe2\x80\x94but I silenced him with a look that quelled him for\r\nthe rest of the journey; and when, at the last stage, I would have\r\ntaken the reins into my own hand, they all with one accord opposed it.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight when we entered M\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and drew up at the \xe2\x80\x9cRose and\r\nCrown.\xe2\x80\x9d I alighted and called aloud for a post-chaise to Grassdale.\r\nThere was none to be had: the only one in the town was under repair. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\ngig, then\xe2\x80\x94a fly\xe2\x80\x94car\xe2\x80\x94anything\xe2\x80\x94only be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d There was a gig, but not a\r\nhorse to spare. I sent into the town to seek one: but they were such an\r\nintolerable time about it that I could wait no longer\xe2\x80\x94I thought my own\r\nfeet could carry me sooner; and bidding them send the conveyance after\r\nme, if it were ready within an hour, I set off as fast as I could walk.\r\nThe distance was little more than six miles, but the road was strange,\r\nand I had to keep stopping to inquire my way; hallooing to carters and\r\nclodhoppers, and frequently invading the cottages, for there were few\r\nabroad that winter\xe2\x80\x99s morning; sometimes knocking up the lazy people\r\nfrom their beds, for where so little work was to be done, perhaps so\r\nlittle food and fire to be had, they cared not to curtail their\r\nslumbers. I had no time to think of _them_, however; aching with\r\nweariness and desperation, I hurried on. The gig did not overtake me:\r\nand it was well I had not waited for it; vexatious rather, that I had\r\nbeen fool enough to wait so long.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, I entered the neighbourhood of Grassdale. I\r\napproached the little rural church\xe2\x80\x94but lo! there stood a train of\r\ncarriages before it; it needed not the white favours bedecking the\r\nservants and horses, nor the merry voices of the village idlers\r\nassembled to witness the show, to apprise me that there was a wedding\r\nwithin. I ran in among them, demanding, with breathless eagerness, had\r\nthe ceremony long commenced? They only gaped and stared. In my\r\ndesperation, I pushed past them, and was about to enter the churchyard\r\ngate, when a group of ragged urchins, that had been hanging like bees\r\nto the window, suddenly dropped off and made a rush for the porch,\r\nvociferating in the uncouth dialect of their country something which\r\nsignified, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s over\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re coming out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Eliza Millward had seen me then she might indeed have been\r\ndelighted. I grasped the gate-post for support, and stood intently\r\ngazing towards the door to take my last look on my soul\xe2\x80\x99s delight, my\r\nfirst on that detested mortal who had torn her from my heart, and\r\ndoomed her, I was certain, to a life of misery and hollow, vain\r\nrepining\xe2\x80\x94for what happiness could she enjoy with him? I did not wish to\r\nshock her with my presence now, but I had not power to move away. Forth\r\ncame the bride and bridegroom. Him I saw not; I had eyes for none but\r\nher. A long veil shrouded half her graceful form, but did not hide it;\r\nI could see that while she carried her head erect, her eyes were bent\r\nupon the ground, and her face and neck were suffused with a crimson\r\nblush; but every feature was radiant with smiles, and gleaming through\r\nthe misty whiteness of her veil were clusters of golden ringlets! Oh,\r\nheavens! it was _not_ my Helen! The first glimpse made me start\xe2\x80\x94but my\r\neyes were darkened with exhaustion and despair. Dare I trust them?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it _is_ not she! It was a younger, slighter, rosier beauty\xe2\x80\x94lovely\r\nindeed, but with far less dignity and depth of soul\xe2\x80\x94without that\r\nindefinable grace, that keenly _spiritual_ yet gentle charm, that\r\nineffable power to attract and subjugate the heart\xe2\x80\x94_my_ heart at least.\r\nI looked at the bridegroom\xe2\x80\x94it was Frederick Lawrence! I wiped away the\r\ncold drops that were trickling down my forehead, and stepped back as he\r\napproached; but, his eyes fell upon me, and he knew me, altered as my\r\nappearance must have been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Markham?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, startled and confounded at the\r\napparition\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, too, at the wildness of my looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lawrence; is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d I mustered the presence of mind to reply.\r\n\r\nHe smiled and coloured, as if half-proud and half-ashamed of his\r\nidentity; and if he had reason to be proud of the sweet lady on his\r\narm, he had no less cause to be ashamed of having concealed his good\r\nfortune so long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to introduce you to my bride,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, endeavouring to hide\r\nhis embarrassment by an assumption of careless gaiety. \xe2\x80\x9cEsther, this is\r\nMr. Markham; my friend Markham, Mrs. Lawrence, late Miss Hargrave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed to the bride, and vehemently wrung the bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not tell me of this?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, reproachfully, pretending a\r\nresentment I did not feel (for in truth I was almost wild with joy to\r\nfind myself so happily mistaken, and overflowing with affection to him\r\nfor this and for the base injustice I felt that I had done him in my\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94he might have wronged me, but not to _that_ extent; and as I had\r\nhated him like a demon for the last forty hours, the reaction from such\r\na feeling was so great that I could pardon all offences for the\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94and love him in spite of them too).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _did_ tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with an air of guilty confusion; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nreceived my letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one announcing my intended marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never received the most distant hint of such an intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have crossed you on your way then\xe2\x80\x94it should have reached you\r\nyesterday morning\xe2\x80\x94it was rather late, I acknowledge. But what brought\r\nyou here, then, if you received no information?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now _my_ turn to be confounded; but the young lady, who had been\r\nbusily patting the snow with her foot during our short sotto-voce\r\ncolloquy, very opportunely came to my assistance by pinching her\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s arm and whispering a suggestion that his friend should be\r\ninvited to step into the carriage and go with them; it being scarcely\r\nagreeable to stand there among so many gazers, and keeping their\r\nfriends waiting into the bargain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so cold as it is too!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, glancing with dismay at her slight\r\ndrapery, and immediately handing her into the carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cMarkham, will\r\nyou come? We are going to Paris, but we can drop you anywhere between\r\nthis and Dover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you. Good-by\xe2\x80\x94I needn\xe2\x80\x99t wish you a pleasant journey; but I\r\nshall expect a very handsome apology, some time, mind, and scores of\r\nletters, before we meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook my hand, and hastened to take his place beside his lady. This\r\nwas no time or place for explanation or discourse: we had already stood\r\nlong enough to excite the wonder of the village sight-seers, and\r\nperhaps the wrath of the attendant bridal party; though, of course, all\r\nthis passed in a much shorter time than I have taken to relate, or even\r\nthan you will take to read it. I stood beside the carriage, and, the\r\nwindow being down, I saw my happy friend fondly encircle his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s waist with his arm, while she rested her glowing cheek on\r\nhis shoulder, looking the very impersonation of loving, trusting bliss.\r\nIn the interval between the footman\xe2\x80\x99s closing the door and taking his\r\nplace behind she raised her smiling brown eyes to his face, observing,\r\nplayfully,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI fear you must think me very insensible, Frederick: I know\r\nit is the custom for ladies to cry on these occasions, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsqueeze a tear for my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only answered with a kiss, and pressed her still closer to his\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Esther, you\xe2\x80\x99re crying now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only too much happiness\xe2\x80\x94and the wish,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our dear Helen were as happy as ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you for that wish!\xe2\x80\x9d I inwardly responded, as the carriage rolled\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand heaven grant it be not wholly vain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought a cloud had suddenly darkened her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face as she\r\nspoke. What did he think? Could he grudge such happiness to his dear\r\nsister and his friend as he now felt himself? At _such_ a moment it was\r\nimpossible. The contrast between her fate and his _must_ darken his\r\nbliss for a time. Perhaps, too, he thought of me: perhaps he regretted\r\nthe part he had had in preventing our union, by omitting to help us, if\r\nnot by actually plotting against us. I exonerated him from _that_\r\ncharge now, and deeply lamented my former ungenerous suspicions; but he\r\n_had_ wronged us, still\xe2\x80\x94I hoped, I trusted that he had. He had not\r\nattempted to check the course of our love by actually damming up the\r\nstreams in their passage, but he had passively watched the two currents\r\nwandering through life\xe2\x80\x99s arid wilderness, declining to clear away the\r\nobstructions that divided them, and secretly hoping that both would\r\nlose themselves in the sand before they could be joined in one. And\r\nmeantime he had been quietly proceeding with his own affairs; perhaps,\r\nhis heart and head had been so full of his fair lady that he had had\r\nbut little thought to spare for others. Doubtless he had made his first\r\nacquaintance with her\xe2\x80\x94his first intimate acquaintance at least\xe2\x80\x94during\r\nhis three months\xe2\x80\x99 sojourn at F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, for I now recollected that he had\r\nonce casually let fall an intimation that his aunt and sister had a\r\nyoung friend staying with them at the time, and this accounted for at\r\nleast one-half his silence about all transactions there. Now, too, I\r\nsaw a reason for many little things that had slightly puzzled me\r\nbefore; among the rest, for sundry departures from Woodford, and\r\nabsences more or less prolonged, for which he never satisfactorily\r\naccounted, and concerning which he hated to be questioned on his\r\nreturn. Well might the servant say his master was \xe2\x80\x9cvery close.\xe2\x80\x9d But why\r\nthis strange reserve to _me?_ Partly, from that remarkable idiosyncrasy\r\nto which I have before alluded; partly, perhaps, from tenderness to my\r\nfeelings, or fear to disturb my philosophy by touching upon the\r\ninfectious theme of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tardy gig had overtaken me at last. I entered it, and bade the man\r\nwho brought it drive to Grassdale Manor\xe2\x80\x94I was too busy with my own\r\nthoughts to care to drive it myself. I would see Mrs. Huntingdon\xe2\x80\x94there\r\ncould be no impropriety in that now that her husband had been dead\r\nabove a year\xe2\x80\x94and by her indifference or her joy at my unexpected\r\narrival I could soon tell whether her heart was truly mine. But my\r\ncompanion, a loquacious, forward fellow, was not disposed to leave me\r\nto the indulgence of my private cogitations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they go!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as the carriages filed away before us.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be brave doings on yonder _to-day_, as what come\r\nto-morra.\xe2\x80\x94Know anything of that family, sir? or you\xe2\x80\x99re a stranger in\r\nthese parts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know them by report.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! There\xe2\x80\x99s the best of \xe2\x80\x99em gone, anyhow. And I suppose the old\r\nmissis is agoing to leave after this stir\xe2\x80\x99s gotten overed, and take\r\nherself off, somewhere, to live on her bit of a jointure; and the young\r\n\xe2\x80\x99un\xe2\x80\x94at least the new \xe2\x80\x99un (she\xe2\x80\x99s none so very young)\xe2\x80\x94is coming down to\r\nlive at the Grove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Hargrave married, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir, a few months since. He should a been wed afore, to a widow\r\nlady, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree over the money: she\xe2\x80\x99d a rare long purse,\r\nand Mr. Hargrave wanted it all to hisself; but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let it go,\r\nand so then they fell out. This one isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as rich, nor as\r\nhandsome either, but she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been married before. She\xe2\x80\x99s very plain,\r\nthey say, and getting on to forty or past, and so, you know, if she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t jump at this hopportunity, she thought she\xe2\x80\x99d never get a better.\r\nI guess she thought such a handsome young husband was worth all \xe2\x80\x99at\r\never she had, and he might take it and welcome, but I lay she\xe2\x80\x99ll rue\r\nher bargain afore long. They say she begins already to see \xe2\x80\x99at he isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnot altogether that nice, generous, perlite, delightful gentleman \xe2\x80\x99at\r\nshe thought him afore marriage\xe2\x80\x94he begins a being careless and masterful\r\nalready. Ay, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll find him harder and carelesser nor she thinks\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be well acquainted with him,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99ve known him since he was quite a young gentleman; and a\r\nproud \xe2\x80\x99un he was, and a wilful. I was servant yonder for several years;\r\nbut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand their niggardly ways\xe2\x80\x94she got ever longer and\r\nworse, did missis, with her nipping and screwing, and watching and\r\ngrudging; so I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d find another place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we not near the house?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, interrupting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; yond\xe2\x80\x99s the park.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart sank within me to behold that stately mansion in the midst of\r\nits expansive grounds. The park as beautiful now, in its wintry garb,\r\nas it could be in its summer glory: the majestic sweep, the undulating\r\nswell and fall, displayed to full advantage in that robe of dazzling\r\npurity, stainless and printless\xe2\x80\x94save one long, winding track left by\r\nthe trooping deer\xe2\x80\x94the stately timber-trees with their heavy-laden\r\nbranches gleaming white against the dull, grey sky; the deep,\r\nencircling woods; the broad expanse of water sleeping in frozen quiet;\r\nand the weeping ash and willow drooping their snow-clad boughs above\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94all presented a picture, striking indeed, and pleasing to an\r\nunencumbered mind, but by no means encouraging to me. There was one\r\ncomfort, however,\xe2\x80\x94all this was entailed upon little Arthur, and could\r\nnot under any circumstances, strictly speaking, be his mother\xe2\x80\x99s. But\r\nhow was she situated? Overcoming with a sudden effort my repugnance to\r\nmention her name to my garrulous companion, I asked him if he knew\r\nwhether her late husband had left a will, and how the property had been\r\ndisposed of. Oh, yes, he knew all about it; and I was quickly informed\r\nthat to her had been left the full control and management of the estate\r\nduring her son\xe2\x80\x99s minority, besides the absolute, unconditional\r\npossession of her own fortune (but I knew that her father had not given\r\nher much), and the small additional sum that had been settled upon her\r\nbefore marriage.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the explanation we drew up at the park-gates. Now\r\nfor the trial. If I should find her within\xe2\x80\x94but alas! she might be still\r\nat Staningley: her brother had given me no intimation to the contrary.\r\nI inquired at the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge if Mrs. Huntingdon were at home. No,\r\nshe was with her aunt in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94shire, but was expected to return before\r\nChristmas. She usually spent most of her time at Staningley, only\r\ncoming to Grassdale occasionally, when the management of affairs, or\r\nthe interest of her tenants and dependents, required her presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear what town is Staningley situated?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. The requisite\r\ninformation was soon obtained. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, my man, give me the reins,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ll return to M\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. I must have some breakfast at the \xe2\x80\x98Rose and\r\nCrown,\xe2\x80\x99 and then away to Staningley by the first coach for \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt M\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 I had time before the coach started to replenish my forces with\r\na hearty breakfast, and to obtain the refreshment of my usual morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nablutions, and the amelioration of some slight change in my toilet, and\r\nalso to despatch a short note to my mother (excellent son that I was),\r\nto assure her that I was still in existence, and to excuse my\r\nnon-appearance at the expected time. It was a long journey to\r\nStaningley for those slow-travelling days, but I did not deny myself\r\nneedful refreshment on the road, nor even a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest at a wayside\r\ninn, choosing rather to brook a little delay than to present myself\r\nworn, wild, and weather-beaten before my mistress and her aunt, who\r\nwould be astonished enough to see me without that. Next morning,\r\ntherefore, I not only fortified myself with as substantial a breakfast\r\nas my excited feelings would allow me to swallow, but I bestowed a\r\nlittle more than usual time and care upon my toilet; and, furnished\r\nwith a change of linen from my small carpet-bag, well-brushed clothes,\r\nwell-polished boots, and neat new gloves, I mounted \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lightning,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand resumed my journey. I had nearly two stages yet before me, but the\r\ncoach, I was informed, passed through the neighbourhood of Staningley,\r\nand having desired to be set down as near the Hall as possible, I had\r\nnothing to do but to sit with folded arms and speculate upon the coming\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear, frosty morning. The very fact of sitting exalted aloft,\r\nsurveying the snowy landscape and sweet sunny sky, inhaling the pure,\r\nbracing air, and crunching away over the crisp frozen snow, was\r\nexhilarating enough in itself; but add to this the idea of to what goal\r\nI was hastening, and whom I expected to meet, and you may have some\r\nfaint conception of my frame of mind at the time\xe2\x80\x94only a _faint_ one,\r\nthough, for my heart swelled with unspeakable delight, and my spirits\r\nrose almost to madness, in spite of my prudent endeavours to bind them\r\ndown to a reasonable platitude by thinking of the undeniable difference\r\nbetween Helen\xe2\x80\x99s rank and mine; of all that she had passed through since\r\nour parting; of her long, unbroken silence; and, above all, of her\r\ncool, cautious aunt, whose counsels she would doubtless be careful not\r\nto slight again. These considerations made my heart flutter with\r\nanxiety, and my chest heave with impatience to get the crisis over; but\r\nthey could not dim her image in my mind, or mar the vivid recollection\r\nof what had been said and felt between us, or destroy the keen\r\nanticipation of what was to be: in fact, I could not realise their\r\nterrors now. Towards the close of the journey, however, a couple of my\r\nfellow-passengers kindly came to my assistance, and brought me low\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine land this,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them, pointing with his umbrella to the\r\nwide fields on the right, conspicuous for their compact hedgerows,\r\ndeep, well-cut ditches, and fine timber-trees, growing sometimes on the\r\nborders, sometimes in the midst of the enclosure: \xe2\x80\x9c_very_ fine land, if\r\nyou saw it in the summer or spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the other, a gruff elderly man, with a drab greatcoat\r\nbuttoned up to the chin, and a cotton umbrella between his knees. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nold Maxwell\xe2\x80\x99s, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_ his, sir; but he\xe2\x80\x99s dead now, you\xe2\x80\x99re aware, and has left it\r\nall to his niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery rood of it, and the mansion-house and all! every hatom of his\r\nworldly goods, except just a trifle, by way of remembrance, to his\r\nnephew down in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94shire, and an annuity to his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s strange, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, sir; and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his own niece neither. But he had no near\r\nrelations of his own\xe2\x80\x94none but a nephew he\xe2\x80\x99d quarrelled with; and he\r\nalways had a partiality for this one. And then his wife advised him to\r\nit, they say: she\xe2\x80\x99d brought most of the property, and it was her wish\r\nthat this lady should have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! She\xe2\x80\x99ll be a fine catch for somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will so. She\xe2\x80\x99s a widow, but quite young yet, and uncommon\r\nhandsome: a fortune of her own, besides, and only one child, and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnursing a fine estate for him in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be lots to speak for her!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99fraid there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance for uz\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(facetiously jogging me with his\r\nelbow, as well as his companion)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cha, ha, ha! No offence, sir, I\r\nhope?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(to me). \xe2\x80\x9cAhem! I should think she\xe2\x80\x99ll marry none but a nobleman\r\nmyself. Look ye, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he, turning to his other neighbour, and\r\npointing past me with his umbrella, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the Hall: grand park, you\r\nsee, and all them woods\xe2\x80\x94plenty of timber there, and lots of game.\r\nHallo! what now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis exclamation was occasioned by the sudden stoppage of the coach at\r\nthe park-gates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGen\xe2\x80\x99leman for Staningley Hall?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the coachman and I rose and\r\nthrew my carpet-bag on to the ground, preparatory to dropping myself\r\ndown after it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSickly, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my talkative neighbour, staring me in the face. I\r\ndaresay it was white enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Here, coachman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee, sir.\xe2\x80\x94All right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coachman pocketed his fee and drove away, leaving me, not walking\r\nup the park, but pacing to and fro before its gates, with folded arms,\r\nand eyes fixed upon the ground, an overwhelming force of images,\r\nthoughts, impressions crowding on my mind, and nothing tangibly\r\ndistinct but this: My love had been cherished in vain\xe2\x80\x94my hope was gone\r\nfor ever; I must tear myself away at once, and banish or suppress all\r\nthoughts of her, like the remembrance of a wild, mad dream. Gladly\r\nwould I have lingered round the place for hours, in the hope of\r\ncatching at least one distant glimpse of her before I went, but it must\r\nnot be\xe2\x80\x94I must not suffer her to see me; for what could have brought me\r\nhither but the hope of reviving her attachment, with a view hereafter\r\nto obtain her hand? And could I bear that she should think me capable\r\nof such a thing?\xe2\x80\x94of presuming upon the acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94the _love_, if you\r\nwill\xe2\x80\x94accidentally contracted, or rather forced upon her against her\r\nwill, when she was an unknown fugitive, toiling for her own support,\r\napparently without fortune, family, or connections; to come upon her\r\nnow, when she was reinstated in her proper sphere, and claim a share in\r\nher prosperity, which, had it never failed her, would most certainly\r\nhave kept her unknown to me for ever? And this, too, when we had parted\r\nsixteen months ago, and she had expressly forbidden me to hope for a\r\nre-union in this world, and never sent me a line or a message from that\r\nday to this. No! The very idea was intolerable.\r\n\r\nAnd even if she should have a lingering affection for me still, ought I\r\nto disturb her peace by awakening those feelings? to subject her to the\r\nstruggles of conflicting duty and inclination\xe2\x80\x94to whichsoever side the\r\nlatter might allure, or the former imperatively call her\xe2\x80\x94whether she\r\nshould deem it her duty to risk the slights and censures of the world,\r\nthe sorrow and displeasure of those she loved, for a romantic idea of\r\ntruth and constancy to me, or to sacrifice her individual wishes to the\r\nfeelings of her friends and her own sense of prudence and the fitness\r\nof things? No\xe2\x80\x94and I would not! I would go at once, and she should never\r\nknow that I had approached the place of her abode: for though I might\r\ndisclaim all idea of ever aspiring to her hand, or even of soliciting a\r\nplace in her friendly regard, her peace should not be broken by my\r\npresence, nor her heart afflicted by the sight of my fidelity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu then, dear Helen, forever! Forever adieu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo said I\xe2\x80\x94and yet I could not tear myself away. I moved a few paces,\r\nand then looked back, for one last view of her stately home, that I\r\nmight have its outward form, at least, impressed upon my mind as\r\nindelibly as her own image, which, alas! I must not see again\xe2\x80\x94then\r\nwalked a few steps further; and then, lost in melancholy musings,\r\npaused again and leant my back against a rough old tree that grew\r\nbeside the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile standing thus, absorbed in my gloomy reverie, a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncarriage came round the corner of the road. I did not look at it; and\r\nhad it rolled quietly by me, I should not have remembered the fact of\r\nits appearance at all; but a tiny voice from within it roused me by\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cMamma, mamma, here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Markham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not hear the reply, but presently the same voice answered, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nindeed, mamma\xe2\x80\x94look for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not raise my eyes, but I suppose mamma looked, for a clear\r\nmelodious voice, whose tones thrilled through my nerves, exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, aunt! here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Markham, Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s friend! Stop, Richard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was such evidence of joyous though suppressed excitement in the\r\nutterance of those few words\xe2\x80\x94especially that tremulous, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, aunt\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nit threw me almost off my guard. The carriage stopped immediately, and\r\nI looked up and met the eye of a pale, grave, elderly lady surveying me\r\nfrom the open window. She bowed, and so did I, and then she withdrew\r\nher head, while Arthur screamed to the footman to let him out; but\r\nbefore that functionary could descend from his box a hand was silently\r\nput forth from the carriage window. I knew that hand, though a black\r\nglove concealed its delicate whiteness and half its fair proportions,\r\nand quickly seizing it, I pressed it in my own\xe2\x80\x94ardently for a moment,\r\nbut instantly recollecting myself, I dropped it, and it was immediately\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you coming to see us, or only passing by?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the low voice of\r\nits owner, who, I felt, was attentively surveying my countenance from\r\nbehind the thick black veil which, with the shadowing panels, entirely\r\nconcealed her own from me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I came to see the place,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _place_,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated she, in a tone which betokened more displeasure\r\nor disappointment than surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not enter it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! he _must_ enter,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Arthur, running round from the other\r\ndoor; and seizing my hand in both his, he shook it heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember me, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, full well, my little man, altered though you are,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I,\r\nsurveying the comparatively tall, slim young gentleman, with his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s image visibly stamped upon his fair, intelligent features, in\r\nspite of the blue eyes beaming with gladness, and the bright locks\r\nclustering beneath his cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I not grown?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, stretching himself up to his full height.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrown! three inches, upon my word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was _seven_ last birthday,\xe2\x80\x9d was the proud rejoinder. \xe2\x80\x9cIn seven years\r\nmore I shall be as tall as you nearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArthur,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, \xe2\x80\x9ctell him to come in. Go on, Richard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a touch of sadness as well as coldness in her voice, but I\r\nknew not to what to ascribe it. The carriage drove on and entered the\r\ngates before us. My little companion led me up the park, discoursing\r\nmerrily all the way. Arrived at the hall-door, I paused on the steps\r\nand looked round me, waiting to recover my composure, if possible\xe2\x80\x94or,\r\nat any rate, to remember my new-formed resolutions and the principles\r\non which they were founded; and it was not till Arthur had been for\r\nsome time gently pulling my coat, and repeating his invitations to\r\nenter, that I at length consented to accompany him into the apartment\r\nwhere the ladies awaited us.\r\n\r\nHelen eyed me as I entered with a kind of gentle, serious scrutiny, and\r\npolitely asked after Mrs. Markham and Rose. I respectfully answered her\r\ninquiries. Mrs. Maxwell begged me to be seated, observing it was rather\r\ncold, but she supposed I had not travelled far that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite twenty miles,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot on foot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Madam, by coach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Rachel, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arthur, the only truly happy one amongst us,\r\ndirecting my attention to that worthy individual, who had just entered\r\nto take her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s things. She vouchsafed me an almost friendly\r\nsmile of recognition\xe2\x80\x94a favour that demanded, at least, a civil\r\nsalutation on my part, which was accordingly given and respectfully\r\nreturned\xe2\x80\x94she had seen the error of her former estimation of my\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWhen Helen was divested of her lugubrious bonnet and veil, her heavy\r\nwinter cloak, &c., she looked so like herself that I knew not how to\r\nbear it. I was particularly glad to see her beautiful black hair,\r\nunstinted still, and unconcealed in its glossy luxuriance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma has left off her widow\xe2\x80\x99s cap in honour of uncle\xe2\x80\x99s marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Arthur, reading my looks with a child\xe2\x80\x99s mingled simplicity and\r\nquickness of observation. Mamma looked grave and Mrs. Maxwell shook her\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd aunt Maxwell is never going to leave off hers,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted\r\nthe naughty boy; but when he saw that his pertness was seriously\r\ndispleasing and painful to his aunt, he went and silently put his arm\r\nround her neck, kissed her cheek, and withdrew to the recess of one of\r\nthe great bay-windows, where he quietly amused himself with his dog,\r\nwhile Mrs. Maxwell gravely discussed with me the interesting topics of\r\nthe weather, the season, and the roads. I considered her presence very\r\nuseful as a check upon my natural impulses\xe2\x80\x94an antidote to those\r\nemotions of tumultuous excitement which would otherwise have carried me\r\naway against my reason and my will; but _just then_ I felt the\r\nrestraint almost intolerable, and I had the greatest difficulty in\r\nforcing myself to attend to her remarks and answer them with ordinary\r\npoliteness; for I was sensible that Helen was standing within a few\r\nfeet of me beside the fire. I dared not look at her, but I felt her eye\r\nwas upon me, and from one hasty, furtive glance, I thought her cheek\r\nwas slightly flushed, and that her fingers, as she played with her\r\nwatch-chain, were agitated with that restless, trembling motion which\r\nbetokens high excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, availing herself of the first pause in the\r\nattempted conversation between her aunt and me, and speaking fast and\r\nlow, with her eyes bent on the gold chain\xe2\x80\x94for I now ventured another\r\nglance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTell me how you all are at Lindenhope\xe2\x80\x94has nothing happened\r\nsince I left you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody dead? nobody married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr\xe2\x80\x94or expecting to marry?\xe2\x80\x94No old ties dissolved or new ones formed? no\r\nold friends forgotten or supplanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped her voice so low in the last sentence that no one could\r\nhave caught the concluding words but myself, and at the same time\r\nturned her eyes upon me with a dawning smile, most sweetly melancholy,\r\nand a look of timid though keen inquiry that made my cheeks tingle with\r\ninexpressible emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe not,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not, if others are as little\r\nchanged as I.\xe2\x80\x9d Her face glowed in sympathy with mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you really did not mean to call?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feared to intrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo intrude!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, with an impatient gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but as if\r\nsuddenly recollecting her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s presence, she checked herself, and,\r\nturning to that lady, continued\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, aunt, this man is my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclose friend, and was my own intimate acquaintance (for a few short\r\nmonths at least), and professed a great attachment to my boy\xe2\x80\x94and when\r\nhe passes the house, so many scores of miles from his home, he declines\r\nto look in for fear of intruding!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Markham is over-modest,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. Maxwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver-ceremonious rather,\xe2\x80\x9d said her niece\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cover\xe2\x80\x94well, it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd turning from me, she seated herself in a chair beside the table,\r\nand pulling a book to her by the cover, began to turn over the leaves\r\nin an energetic kind of abstraction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had known,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would have honoured me by\r\nremembering me as an intimate acquaintance, I most likely should not\r\nhave denied myself the pleasure of calling upon you, but I thought you\r\nhad forgotten me long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou judged of others by yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered she without raising her\r\neyes from the book, but reddening as she spoke, and hastily turning\r\nover a dozen leaves at once.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, of which Arthur thought he might venture to avail\r\nhimself to introduce his handsome young setter, and show me how\r\nwonderfully it was grown and improved, and to ask after the welfare of\r\nits father Sancho. Mrs. Maxwell then withdrew to take off her things.\r\nHelen immediately pushed the book from her, and after silently\r\nsurveying her son, his friend, and his dog for a few moments, she\r\ndismissed the former from the room under pretence of wishing him to\r\nfetch his last new book to show me. The child obeyed with alacrity; but\r\nI continued caressing the dog. The silence might have lasted till its\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s return, had it depended on me to break it; but, in half a\r\nminute or less, my hostess impatiently rose, and, taking her former\r\nstation on the rug between me and the chimney corner, earnestly\r\nexclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert, what _is_ the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x94why are you so changed? It is\r\na very indiscreet question, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastened to add: \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps a\r\nvery rude one\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t answer it if you think so\xe2\x80\x94but I hate mysteries and\r\nconcealments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not changed, Helen\xe2\x80\x94unfortunately I am as keen and passionate as\r\never\xe2\x80\x94it is not I, it is circumstances that are changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat circumstances? _Do_ tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d Her cheek was blanched with the\r\nvery anguish of anxiety\xe2\x80\x94could it be with the fear that I had rashly\r\npledged my faith to another?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI will confess that I came here for\r\nthe purpose of seeing you (not without some monitory misgivings at my\r\nown presumption, and fears that I should be as little welcome as\r\nexpected when I came), but I did not know that this estate was yours\r\nuntil enlightened on the subject of your inheritance by the\r\nconversation of two fellow-passengers in the last stage of my journey;\r\nand then I saw at once the folly of the hopes I had cherished, and the\r\nmadness of retaining them a moment longer; and though I alighted at\r\nyour gates, I determined not to enter within them; I lingered a few\r\nminutes to see the place, but was fully resolved to return to M\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\nwithout seeing its mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if my aunt and I had not been just returning from our morning\r\ndrive, I should have seen and heard no more of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would be better for both that we should not meet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied I, as calmly as I could, but not daring to speak above my\r\nbreath, from conscious inability to steady my voice, and not daring to\r\nlook in her face lest my firmness should forsake me altogether. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought an interview would only disturb your peace and madden me. But I\r\nam glad, now, of this opportunity of seeing you once more and knowing\r\nthat you have not forgotten me, and of assuring you that I shall never\r\ncease to remember you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause. Mrs. Huntingdon moved away, and stood in\r\nthe recess of the window. Did she regard this as an intimation that\r\nmodesty alone prevented me from asking her hand? and was she\r\nconsidering how to repulse me with the smallest injury to my feelings?\r\nBefore I could speak to relieve her from such a perplexity, she broke\r\nthe silence herself by suddenly turning towards me and observing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have had such an opportunity before\xe2\x80\x94as far, I mean, as\r\nregards assuring me of your kindly recollections, and yourself of mine,\r\nif you had written to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have done so, but I did not know your address, and did not\r\nlike to ask your brother, because I thought he would object to my\r\nwriting; but this would not have deterred me for a moment, if I could\r\nhave ventured to believe that you expected to hear from me, or even\r\nwasted a thought upon your unhappy friend; but your silence naturally\r\nled me to conclude myself forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you expect me to write to _you_, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Helen\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Huntingdon,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, blushing at the implied\r\nimputation, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly not; but if you had sent me a message through\r\nyour brother, or even asked him about me now and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did ask about you frequently. I was not going to do more,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nshe, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as you continued to restrict yourself to a few\r\npolite inquiries about my health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother never told me that you had mentioned my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever ask him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; for I saw he did not wish to be questioned about you, or to afford\r\nthe slightest encouragement or assistance to my too obstinate\r\nattachment.\xe2\x80\x9d Helen did not reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was perfectly right,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nI. But she remained in silence, looking out upon the snowy lawn. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\r\nwill relieve her of my presence,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I; and immediately I rose and\r\nadvanced to take leave, with a most heroic resolution\xe2\x80\x94but pride was at\r\nthe bottom of it, or it could not have carried me through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going already?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, taking the hand I offered, and not\r\nimmediately letting it go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I stay any longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till Arthur comes, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnly too glad to obey, I stood and leant against the opposite side of\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me you were not changed,\xe2\x80\x9d said my companion: \xe2\x80\x9cyou _are_\xe2\x80\x94very\r\nmuch so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mrs. Huntingdon, I only ought to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to maintain that you have the same regard for me that you\r\nhad when last we met?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have; but it would be wrong to talk of it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was wrong to talk of it _then_, Gilbert; it would _not_ now\xe2\x80\x94unless\r\nto do so would be to violate the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was too much agitated to speak; but, without waiting for an answer,\r\nshe turned away her glistening eye and crimson cheek, and threw up the\r\nwindow and looked out, whether to calm her own, excited feelings, or to\r\nrelieve her embarrassment, or only to pluck that beautiful half-blown\r\nChristmas-rose that grew upon the little shrub without, just peeping\r\nfrom the snow that had hitherto, no doubt, defended it from the frost,\r\nand was now melting away in the sun. Pluck it, however, she did, and\r\nhaving gently dashed the glittering powder from its leaves, approached\r\nit to her lips and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis rose is not so fragrant as a summer flower, but it has stood\r\nthrough hardships none of _them_ could bear: the cold rain of winter\r\nhas sufficed to nourish it, and its faint sun to warm it; the bleak\r\nwinds have not blanched it, or broken its stem, and the keen frost has\r\nnot blighted it. Look, Gilbert, it is still fresh and blooming as a\r\nflower can be, with the cold snow even now on its petals.\xe2\x80\x94Will you have\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI held out my hand: I dared not speak lest my emotion should overmaster\r\nme. She laid the rose across my palm, but I scarcely closed my fingers\r\nupon it, so deeply was I absorbed in thinking what might be the meaning\r\nof her words, and what I ought to do or say upon the occasion; whether\r\nto give way to my feelings or restrain them still. Misconstruing this\r\nhesitation into indifference\xe2\x80\x94or reluctance even\xe2\x80\x94to accept her gift,\r\nHelen suddenly snatched it from my hand, threw it out on to the snow,\r\nshut down the window with an emphasis, and withdrew to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, what means this?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, electrified at this startling change\r\nin her demeanour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not understand my gift,\xe2\x80\x9d said she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor, what is worse, you\r\ndespised it. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I gave it you; but since I did make such a\r\nmistake, the only remedy I could think of was to take it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou misunderstood me cruelly,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, and in a minute I had opened\r\nthe window again, leaped out, picked up the flower, brought it in, and\r\npresented it to her, imploring her to give it me again, and I would\r\nkeep it for ever for her sake, and prize it more highly than anything\r\nin the world I possessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will this content you?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as she took it in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, then; take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pressed it earnestly to my lips, and put it in my bosom, Mrs.\r\nHuntingdon looking on with a half-sarcastic smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will if\xe2\x80\x94if I must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ changed,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou are grown either very proud or\r\nvery indifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am neither, Helen\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Huntingdon. If you could see my heart\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _must_ be one,\xe2\x80\x94if not both. And why Mrs. Huntingdon?\xe2\x80\x94why not\r\nHelen, as before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelen, then\xe2\x80\x94dear Helen!\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured. I was in an agony of mingled\r\nlove, hope, delight, uncertainty, and suspense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rose I gave you was an emblem of my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cwould you\r\ntake it away and leave me here alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you give me your hand too, if I asked it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I not said enough?\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with a most enchanting smile. I\r\nsnatched her hand, and would have fervently kissed it, but suddenly\r\nchecked myself, and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut have you considered the consequences?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly, I think, or I should not have offered myself to one too proud\r\nto take me, or too indifferent to make his affection outweigh my\r\nworldly goods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStupid blockhead that I was!\xe2\x80\x94I trembled to clasp her in my arms, but\r\ndared not believe in so much joy, and yet restrained myself to say,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you _should_ repent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be your fault,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI never shall, unless you\r\nbitterly disappoint me. If you have not sufficient confidence in my\r\naffection to believe this, let me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling angel\xe2\x80\x94my _own Helen_,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, now passionately kissing\r\nthe hand I still retained, and throwing my left arm around her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nnever shall repent, if it depend on me alone. But have you thought of\r\nyour aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d I trembled for the answer, and clasped her closer to my\r\nheart in the instinctive dread of losing my new-found treasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt must not know of it yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cShe would think it a\r\nrash, wild step, because she could not imagine how well I know you; but\r\nshe must know you herself, and learn to like you. You must leave us\r\nnow, after lunch, and come again in spring, and make a longer stay, and\r\ncultivate her acquaintance, and I know you will like each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you will be mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, printing a kiss upon her lips, and\r\nanother, and another; for I was as daring and impetuous now as I had\r\nbeen backward and constrained before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94in another year,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, gently disengaging herself from my\r\nembrace, but still fondly clasping my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother year! Oh, Helen, I could not wait so long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your fidelity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean I could not endure the misery of so long a separation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not be a separation: we will write every day: my spirit shall\r\nbe always with you, and sometimes you shall see me with your bodily\r\neye. I will not be such a hypocrite as to pretend that I desire to wait\r\nso long myself, but as my marriage is to please myself, alone, I ought\r\nto consult my friends about the time of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friends will disapprove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not greatly disapprove, dear Gilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, earnestly\r\nkissing my hand; \xe2\x80\x9cthey cannot, when they know you, or, if they could,\r\nthey would not be true friends\xe2\x80\x94I should not care for their\r\nestrangement. Now are you satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked up in my face with a\r\nsmile of ineffable tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be otherwise, with your love? And you _do_ love me, Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI, not doubting the fact, but wishing to hear it confirmed by her own\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you loved as _I_ do,\xe2\x80\x9d she earnestly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would not have so\r\nnearly lost me\xe2\x80\x94these scruples of false delicacy and pride would never\r\nthus have troubled you\xe2\x80\x94you would have seen that the greatest worldly\r\ndistinctions and discrepancies of rank, birth, and fortune are as dust\r\nin the balance compared with the unity of accordant thoughts and\r\nfeelings, and truly loving, sympathising hearts and souls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is too much happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, embracing her again; \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nnot deserved it, Helen\xe2\x80\x94I dare not believe in such felicity: and the\r\nlonger I have to wait, the greater will be my dread that something will\r\nintervene to snatch you from me\xe2\x80\x94and think, a thousand things may happen\r\nin a year!\xe2\x80\x94I shall be in one long fever of restless terror and\r\nimpatience all the time. And besides, winter is such a dreary season.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so too,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she gravely: \xe2\x80\x9cI would not be married in\r\nwinter\xe2\x80\x94in December, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a shudder\xe2\x80\x94for in that\r\nmonth had occurred both the ill-starred marriage that had bound her to\r\nher former husband, and the terrible death that released her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ntherefore I said another year, in spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Next_ spring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94next autumn, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSummer, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the close of summer. There now! be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking Arthur re-entered the room\xe2\x80\x94good boy for keeping\r\nout so long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the book in either of the places you told me to\r\nlook for it\xe2\x80\x9d (there was a conscious something in mamma\xe2\x80\x99s smile that\r\nseemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear, I knew you could not\xe2\x80\x9d), \xe2\x80\x9cbut Rachel got it\r\nfor me at last. Look, Mr. Markham, a natural history, with all kinds of\r\nbirds and beasts in it, and the reading as nice as the pictures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn great good humour I sat down to examine the book, and drew the\r\nlittle fellow between my knees. Had he come a minute before I should\r\nhave received him less graciously, but now I affectionately stroked his\r\ncurling locks, and even kissed his ivory forehead: he was my own\r\nHelen\xe2\x80\x99s son, and therefore mine; and as such I have ever since regarded\r\nhim. That pretty child is now a fine young man: he has realised his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s brightest expectations, and is at present residing in\r\nGrassdale Manor with his young wife\xe2\x80\x94the merry little Helen Hattersley\r\nof yore.\r\n\r\nI had not looked through half the book before Mrs. Maxwell appeared to\r\ninvite me into the other room to lunch. That lady\xe2\x80\x99s cool, distant\r\nmanners rather chilled me at first; but I did my best to propitiate\r\nher, and not entirely without success, I think, even in that first\r\nshort visit; for when I talked cheerfully to her, she gradually became\r\nmore kind and cordial, and when I departed she bade me a gracious\r\nadieu, hoping ere long to have the pleasure of seeing me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must not go till you have seen the conservatory, my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwinter garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Helen, as I advanced to take leave of her, with as\r\nmuch philosophy and self-command as I could summon to my aid.\r\n\r\nI gladly availed myself of such a respite, and followed her into a\r\nlarge and beautiful conservatory, plentifully furnished with flowers,\r\nconsidering the season\xe2\x80\x94but, of course, I had little attention to spare\r\nfor _them_. It was not, however, for any tender colloquy that my\r\ncompanion had brought me there:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt is particularly fond of flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed, \xe2\x80\x9cand she is\r\nfond of Staningley too: I brought you here to offer a petition in her\r\nbehalf, that this may be her home as long as she lives, and\xe2\x80\x94if it be\r\nnot our home likewise\xe2\x80\x94that I may often see her and be with her; for I\r\nfear she will be sorry to lose me; and though she leads a retired and\r\ncontemplative life, she is apt to get low-spirited if left too much\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means, dearest Helen!\xe2\x80\x94do what you will with your own. I should\r\nnot dream of wishing your aunt to leave the place under any\r\ncircumstances; and we will live either here or elsewhere as you and she\r\nmay determine, and you shall see her as often as you like. I know she\r\nmust be pained to part with you, and I am willing to make any\r\nreparation in my power. I love her for your sake, and her happiness\r\nshall be as dear to me as that of my own mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, darling! you shall have a kiss for that. Good-by. There\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94there, Gilbert\xe2\x80\x94let me go\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s Arthur; don\xe2\x80\x99t astonish his\r\ninfantile brain with your madness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is time to bring my narrative to a close. Any one but you would\r\nsay I had made it too long already. But for _your_ satisfaction I will\r\nadd a few words more; because I know you will have a fellow-feeling for\r\nthe old lady, and will wish to know the last of her history. I did come\r\nagain in spring, and, agreeably to Helen\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions, did my best to\r\ncultivate her acquaintance. She received me very kindly, having been,\r\ndoubtless, already prepared to think highly of my character by her\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s too favourable report. I turned my best side out, of course,\r\nand we got along marvellously well together. When my ambitious\r\nintentions were made known to her, she took it more sensibly than I had\r\nventured to hope. Her only remark on the subject, in my hearing, was\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, Mr. Markham, you are going to rob me of my niece, I\r\nunderstand. Well! I hope God will prosper your union, and make my dear\r\ngirl happy at last. Could she have been contented to remain single, I\r\nown I should have been better satisfied; but if she must marry again, I\r\nknow of no one, now living and of a suitable age, to whom I would more\r\nwillingly resign her than yourself, or who would be more likely to\r\nappreciate her worth and make, her truly happy, as far as I can tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I was delighted with the compliment, and hoped to show her\r\nthat she was not mistaken in her favourable judgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, however, one request to offer,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems I am\r\nstill to look on Staningley as my home: I wish you to make it yours\r\nlikewise, for Helen is attached to the place and to me\xe2\x80\x94as I am to her.\r\nThere are painful associations connected with Grassdale, which she\r\ncannot easily overcome; and I shall not molest you with my company or\r\ninterference here: I am a very quiet person, and shall keep my own\r\napartments, and attend to my own concerns, and only see you now and\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I most readily consented to this; and we lived in the\r\ngreatest harmony with our dear aunt until the day of her death, which\r\nmelancholy event took place a few years after\xe2\x80\x94melancholy, not to\r\nherself (for it came quietly upon her, and she was glad to reach her\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x99s end), but only to the few loving friends and grateful\r\ndependents she left behind.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to my own affairs: I was married in summer, on a\r\nglorious August morning. It took the whole eight months, and all\r\nHelen\xe2\x80\x99s kindness and goodness to boot, to overcome my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprejudices against my bride-elect, and to reconcile her to the idea of\r\nmy leaving Linden Grange and living so far away. Yet she was gratified\r\nat her son\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune after all, and proudly attributed it all to\r\nhis own superior merits and endowments. I bequeathed the farm to\r\nFergus, with better hopes of its prosperity than I should have had a\r\nyear ago under similar circumstances; for he had lately fallen in love\r\nwith the Vicar of L\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s eldest daughter\xe2\x80\x94a lady whose superiority had\r\nroused his latent virtues, and stimulated him to the most surprising\r\nexertions, not only to gain her affection and esteem, and to obtain a\r\nfortune sufficient to aspire to her hand, but to render himself worthy\r\nof her, in his own eyes, as well as in those of her parents; and in the\r\nend he was successful, as you already know. As for myself, I need not\r\ntell you how happily my Helen and I have lived together, and how\r\nblessed we still are in each other\xe2\x80\x99s society, and in the promising\r\nyoung scions that are growing up about us. We are just now looking\r\nforward to the advent of you and Rose, for the time of your annual\r\nvisit draws nigh, when you must leave your dusty, smoky, noisy,\r\ntoiling, striving city for a season of invigorating relaxation and\r\nsocial retirement with us.\r\n\r\nTill then, farewell,\r\nGILBERT MARKHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Staningley_, _June_ 10_th_, 1847.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nPrinted by SPOTTISWOODE, BALLENTYNE & CO.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
