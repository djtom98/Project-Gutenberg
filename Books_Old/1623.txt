(9th April, 1873.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SCENE.--The Cottage on the Frontier.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREAMBLE.\r\n\r\nTHE place is France.\r\n\r\nThe time is autumn, in the year eighteen hundred and seventy--the year\r\nof the war between France and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe persons are, Captain Arnault, of the French army; Surgeon Surville,\r\nof the French ambulance; Surgeon Wetzel, of the German army; Mercy\r\nMerrick, attached as nurse to the French ambulance; and Grace Roseberry,\r\na traveling lady on her way to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE TWO WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was a dark night. The rain was pouring in torrents.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening a skirmishing party of the French and a skirmishing\r\nparty of the Germans had met, by accident, near the little village of\r\nLagrange, close to the German frontier. In the struggle that followed,\r\nthe French had (for once) got the better of the enemy. For the time, at\r\nleast, a few hundreds out of the host of the invaders had been forced\r\nback over the frontier. It was a trifling affair, occurring not long\r\nafter the great German victory of Weissenbourg, and the newspapers took\r\nlittle or no notice of it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Arnault, commanding on the French side, sat alone in one of the\r\ncottages of the village, inhabited by the miller of the district. The\r\nCaptain was reading, by the light of a solitary tallow-candle, some\r\nintercepted dispatches taken from the Germans. He had suffered the wood\r\nfire, scattered over the large open grate, to burn low; the red embers\r\nonly faintly illuminated a part of the room. On the floor behind him lay\r\nsome of the miller\xe2\x80\x99s empty sacks. In a corner opposite to him was the\r\nmiller\xe2\x80\x99s solid walnut-wood bed. On the walls all around him were the\r\nmiller\xe2\x80\x99s colored prints, representing a happy mixture of devotional and\r\ndomestic subjects. A door of communication leading into the kitchen of\r\nthe cottage had been torn from its hinges, and used to carry the men\r\nwounded in the skirmish from the field. They were now comfortably laid\r\nat rest in the kitchen, under the care of the French surgeon and the\r\nEnglish nurse attached to the ambulance. A piece of coarse canvas\r\nscreened the opening between the two rooms in place of the door. A\r\nsecond door, leading from the bed-chamber into the yard, was locked; and\r\nthe wooden shutter protecting the one window of the room was carefully\r\nbarred. Sentinels, doubled in number, were placed at all the outposts.\r\nThe French commander had neglected no precaution which could reasonably\r\ninsure for himself and for his men a quiet and comfortable night.\r\n\r\nStill absorbed in his perusal of the dispatches, and now and then making\r\nnotes of what he read by the help of writing materials placed at his\r\nside, Captain Arnault was interrupted by the appearance of an intruder\r\nin the room. Surgeon Surville, entering from the kitchen, drew aside\r\nthe canvas screen, and approached the little round table at which his\r\nsuperior officer was sitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA question to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the surgeon. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we safe for the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to know?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the captain, suspiciously.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon pointed to the kitchen, now the hospital devoted to the\r\nwounded men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor fellows are anxious about the next few hours,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey dread a surprise, and they ask me if there is any reasonable hope\r\nof their having one night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. What do you think of the chances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain shrugged his shoulders. The surgeon persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you ought to know?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that we are in possession of the village for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n retorted Captain Arnault, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know no more. Here are the papers of\r\nthe enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d He held them up and shook them impatiently as he spoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey give me no information that I can rely on. For all I can tell to\r\nthe contrary, the main body of the Germans, outnumbering us ten to one,\r\nmay be nearer this cottage than the main body of the French. Draw your\r\nown conclusions. I have nothing more to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving answered in those discouraging terms, Captain Arnault got on his\r\nfeet, drew the hood of his great-coat over his head, and lit a cigar at\r\nthe candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo visit the outposts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want this room for a little while?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for some hours to come. Are you thinking of moving any of your\r\nwounded men in here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of the English lady,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the surgeon. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kitchen\r\nis not quite the place for her. She would be more comfortable here; and\r\nthe English nurse might keep her company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Arnault smiled, not very pleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are two fine women,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand Surgeon Surville is a ladies\xe2\x80\x99 man. Let them come in, if\r\nthey are rash enough to trust themselves here with you.\xe2\x80\x9d He checked\r\nhimself on the point of going out, and looked back distrustfully at the\r\nlighted candle. \xe2\x80\x9cCaution the women,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto limit the exercise of\r\ntheir curiosity to the inside of this room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain\xe2\x80\x99s forefinger pointed significantly to the closed\r\nwindow-shutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever know a woman who could resist looking out of window?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cDark as it is, sooner or later these ladies of yours will feel\r\ntempted to open that shutter. Tell them I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the light of\r\nthe candle to betray my headquarters to the German scouts. How is the\r\nweather? Still raining?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPouring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better. The Germans won\xe2\x80\x99t see us.\xe2\x80\x9d With that consolatory\r\nremark he unlocked the door leading into the yard, and walked out.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon lifted the canvas screen and called into the kitchen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Merrick, have you time to take a little rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered a soft voice with an underlying melancholy in\r\nit, plainly distinguishable though it had only spoken three words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the surgeon, \xe2\x80\x9cand bring the English lady with\r\nyou. Here is a quiet room all to yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held back the canvas, and the two women appeared.\r\n\r\nThe nurse led the way--tall, lithe, graceful--attired in her uniform\r\ndress of neat black stuff, with plain linen collar and cuffs, and with\r\nthe scarlet cross of the Geneva Convention embroidered on her left\r\nshoulder. Pale and sad, her expression and manner both eloquently\r\nsuggestive of suppressed suffering and sorrow, there was an innate\r\nnobility in the carriage of this woman\xe2\x80\x99s head, an innate grandeur in the\r\ngaze of her large gray eyes and in the lines of her finely proportioned\r\nface, which made her irresistibly striking and beautiful, seen under any\r\ncircumstances and clad in any dress. Her companion, darker in complexion\r\nand smaller in stature, possessed attractions which were quite marked\r\nenough to account for the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s polite anxiety to shelter her in the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s room. The common consent of mankind would have declared her to\r\nbe an unusually pretty woman. She wore the large gray cloak that covered\r\nher from head to foot with a grace that lent its own attractions to a\r\nplain and even a shabby article of dress. The languor in her movements,\r\nand the uncertainty of tone in her voice as she thanked the surgeon\r\nsuggested that she was suffering from fatigue. Her dark eyes searched\r\nthe dimly-lighted room timidly, and she held fast by the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\nwith the air of a woman whose nerves had been severely shaken by some\r\nrecent alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have one thing to remember, ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon. \xe2\x80\x9cBeware\r\nof opening the shutter, for fear of the light being seen through the\r\nwindow. For the rest, we are free to make ourselves as comfortable here\r\nas we can. Compose yourself, dear madam, and rely on the protection of a\r\nFrenchman who is devoted to you!\xe2\x80\x9d He gallantly emphasized his last words\r\nby raising the hand of the English lady to his lips. At the moment when\r\nhe kissed it the canvas screen was again drawn aside. A person in\r\nthe service of the ambulance appeared, announcing that a bandage had\r\nslipped, and that one of the wounded men was to all appearance bleeding\r\nto death. The surgeon, submitting to destiny with the worst possible\r\ngrace, dropped the charming Englishwoman\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and returned to his\r\nduties in the kitchen. The two ladies were left together in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take a chair, madam?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call me \xe2\x80\x98madam,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d returned the young lady, cordially. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is\r\nGrace Roseberry. What is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a pretty name, like yours,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and\r\nhesitated again. \xe2\x80\x9cCall me \xe2\x80\x98Mercy Merrick,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nHad she given an assumed name? Was there some unhappy celebrity attached\r\nto her own name? Miss Roseberry did not wait to ask herself these\r\nquestions. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, gratefully, \xe2\x80\x9cfor your\r\nsisterly kindness to a stranger like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only done my duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy Merrick, a little coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must speak of it. What a situation you found me in when the French\r\nsoldiers had driven the Germans away! My traveling-carriage stopped; the\r\nhorses seized; I myself in a strange country at nightfall, robbed of my\r\nmoney and my luggage, and drenched to the skin by the pouring rain! I am\r\nindebted to you for shelter in this place--I am wearing your clothes--I\r\nshould have died of the fright and the exposure but for you. What return\r\ncan I make for such services as these?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy placed a chair for her guest near the captain\xe2\x80\x99s table, and seated\r\nherself, at some little distance, on an old chest in a corner of the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask you a question?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred questions,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grace, \xe2\x80\x9cif you like.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at the\r\nexpiring fire, and at the dimly visible figure of her companion seated\r\nin the obscurest corner of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThat wretched candle hardly gives\r\nany light,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t last much longer. Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe make the place more cheerful? Come out of your corner. Call for more\r\nwood and more lights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy remained in her corner and shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cCandles and wood are\r\nscarce things here,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must be patient, even if we\r\nare left in the dark. Tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, raising her quiet voice a\r\nlittle, \xe2\x80\x9chow came you to risk crossing the frontier in wartime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s voice dropped when she answered the question. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s momentary\r\ngayety of manner suddenly left her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had urgent reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor returning to England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout any one to protect you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s head sank on her bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cI have left my only protector--my\r\nfather--in the English burial-ground at Rome,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered simply. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nmother died, years since, in Canada.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shadowy figure of the nurse suddenly changed its position on the\r\nchest. She had started as the last word passed Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Canada?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d was the brief answer--reluctantly given, short as it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you ever near Port Logan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI once lived within a few miles of Port Logan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome time since.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words Mercy Merrick shrank back into her\r\ncorner and changed the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cYour relatives in England must be very\r\nanxious about you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nGrace sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no relatives in England. You can hardly imagine\r\na person more friendless than I am. We went away from Canada, when my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s health failed, to try the climate of Italy, by the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadvice. His death has left me not only friendless but poor.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused,\r\nand took a leather letter-case from the pocket of the large gray cloak\r\nwhich the nurse had lent to her. \xe2\x80\x9cMy prospects in life,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9care all contained in this little case. Here is the one treasure I\r\ncontrived to conceal when I was robbed of my other things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy could just see the letter-case as Grace held it up in the\r\ndeepening obscurity of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got money in it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; only a few family papers, and a letter from my father, introducing\r\nme to an elderly lady in England--a connection of his by marriage, whom\r\nI have never seen. The lady has consented to receive me as her companion\r\nand reader. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t return to England soon, some other person may get\r\nthe place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no other resource?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone. My education has been neglected--we led a wild life in the\r\nfar West. I am quite unfit to go out as a governess. I am absolutely\r\ndependent on this stranger, who receives me for my father\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She put the letter-case back in the pocket of her cloak, and ended her\r\nlittle narrative as unaffectedly as she had begun it. \xe2\x80\x9cMine is a sad\r\nstory, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the nurse answered her suddenly and bitterly in these\r\nstrange words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are sadder stories than yours. There are thousands of miserable\r\nwomen who would ask for no greater blessing than to change places with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace started. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can there possibly be to envy in such a lot as\r\nmine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour unblemished character, and your prospect of being established\r\nhonorably in a respectable house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace turned in her chair, and looked wonderingly into the dim corner of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strangely you say that!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. There was no answer; the\r\nshadowy figure on the chest never moved. Grace rose impulsively, and\r\ndrawing her chair after her, approached the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there some\r\nromance in your life?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you sacrificed yourself to\r\nthe terrible duties which I find you performing here? You interest me\r\nindescribably. Give me your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy shrank back, and refused the offered hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we not friends?\xe2\x80\x9d Grace asked, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can never be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse was dumb. Grace called to mind the hesitation that she had\r\nshown when she had mentioned her name, and drew a new conclusion from\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cShould I be guessing right,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cif I guessed you\r\nto be some great lady in disguise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy laughed to herself--low and bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cI a great lady!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ncontemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let us talk of something else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was thoroughly roused. She persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce more,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered, persuasively, \xe2\x80\x9clet us be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d She gently laid her hand\r\nas she spoke on Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. Mercy roughly shook it off. There\r\nwas a rudeness in the action which would have offended the most patient\r\nwoman living. Grace drew back indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\ncruel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am kind,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the nurse, speaking more sternly than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it kind to keep me at a distance? I have told you my story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse\xe2\x80\x99s voice rose excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tempt me to speak out,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cyou will regret it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace declined to accept the warning. \xe2\x80\x9cI have placed confidence in you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is ungenerous to lay me under an obligation, and then\r\nto shut me out of your confidence in return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ have it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy Merrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _shall_ have it! Sit down\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d Grace\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to quicken its beat in expectation of the\r\ndisclosure that was to come. She drew her chair closer to the chest on\r\nwhich the nurse was sitting. With a firm hand Mercy put the chair back\r\nto a distance from her. \xe2\x80\x9cNot so near me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, harshly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so near,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the sternly resolute voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till you have\r\nheard what I have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace obeyed without a word more. There was a momentary silence. A faint\r\nflash of light leaped up from the expiring candle, and showed Mercy\r\ncrouching on the chest, with her elbows on her knees, and her face\r\nhidden in her hands. The next instant the room was buried in obscurity.\r\nAs the darkness fell on the two women the nurse spoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. MAGDALEN--IN MODERN TIMES.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWHEN your mother was alive were you ever out with her after nightfall\r\nin the streets of a great city?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those extraordinary terms Mercy Merrick opened the confidential\r\ninterview which Grace Roseberry had forced on her. Grace answered,\r\nsimply, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will put it in another way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse. Its unnatural hardness\r\nand sternness of tone passed away from her voice, and its native\r\ngentleness and sadness returned, as she made that reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou read the\r\nnewspapers like the rest of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on; \xe2\x80\x9chave you ever\r\nread of your unhappy fellow-creatures (the starving outcasts of the\r\npopulation) whom Want has driven into Sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill wondering, Grace answered that she had read of such things often,\r\nin newspapers and in books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard--when those starving and sinning fellow-creatures\r\nhappened to be women--of Refuges established to protect and reclaim\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wonder in Grace\xe2\x80\x99s mind passed away, and a vague suspicion of\r\nsomething painful to come took its place. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are extraordinary\r\nquestions,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me,\xe2\x80\x9d the nurse insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard of the Refuges? Have\r\nyou heard of the Women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMove your chair a little further away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused. Her voice,\r\nwithout losing its steadiness, fell to its lowest tones. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ was once\r\nof those women,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly.\r\n\r\nGrace sprang to her feet with a faint cry. She stood petrified--\r\nincapable of uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ have been in a Refuge,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the sweet, sad voice of the other\r\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ have been in a Prison. Do you still wish to be my friend? Do\r\nyou still insist on sitting close by me and taking my hand?\xe2\x80\x9d She waited\r\nfor a reply, and no reply came. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see you were wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on,\r\ngently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you called me cruel--and I was right when I told you I was\r\nkind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that appeal Grace composed herself, and spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to\r\noffend you--\xe2\x80\x9d she began, confusedly.\r\n\r\nMercy Merrick stopped her there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t offend me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, without the faintest note of\r\ndispleasure in her tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI am accustomed to stand in the pillory of\r\nmy own past life. I sometimes ask myself if it was all my fault. I\r\nsometimes wonder if Society had no duties toward me when I was a child\r\nselling matches in the street--when I was a hard-working girl fainting\r\nat my needle for want of food.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice faltered a little for the\r\nfirst time as it pronounced those words; she waited a moment, and\r\nrecovered herself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late to dwell on these things now,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cSociety can subscribe to reclaim me; but Society\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t take me back. You see me here in a place of trust--patiently,\r\nhumbly, doing all the good I can. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter! Here, or elsewhere,\r\nwhat I _am_ can never alter what I _was_. For three years past all that\r\na sincerely penitent woman can do I have done. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter! Once\r\nlet my past story be known, and the shadow of it covers me; the kindest\r\npeople shrink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited again. Would a word of sympathy come to comfort her from the\r\nother woman\xe2\x80\x99s lips? No! Miss Roseberry was shocked; Miss Roseberry was\r\nconfused. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry for you,\xe2\x80\x9d was all that Miss Roseberry could\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is sorry for me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the nurse, as patiently as ever;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceverybody is kind to me. But the lost place is not to be regained. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get back! I can\xe2\x80\x99t get back?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a passionate outburst\r\nof despair--checked instantly the moment it had escaped her. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I\r\ntell you what my experience has been?\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you hear the\r\nstory of Magdalen--in modern times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace drew back a step; Mercy instantly understood her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to tell you nothing that you need shrink from hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cA lady in your position would not understand the trials and\r\nthe struggles that I have passed through. My story shall begin at the\r\nRefuge. The matron sent me out to service with the character that I had\r\nhonestly earned--the character of a reclaimed woman. I justified the\r\nconfidence placed in me; I was a faithful servant. One day my mistress\r\nsent for me--a kind mistress, if ever there was one yet. \xe2\x80\x98Mercy, I am\r\nsorry for you; it has come out that I took you from a Refuge; I shall\r\nlose every servant in the house; you must go.\xe2\x80\x99 I went back to the\r\nmatron--another kind woman. She received me like a mother. \xe2\x80\x98We will try\r\nagain, Mercy; don\xe2\x80\x99t be cast down.\xe2\x80\x99 I told you I had been in Canada?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace began to feel interested in spite of herself. She answered with\r\nsomething like warmth in her tone. She returned to her chair--placed at\r\nits safe and significant distance from the chest.\r\n\r\nThe nurse went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy next place was in Canada, with an officer\xe2\x80\x99s wife: gentlefolks who\r\nhad emigrated. More kindness; and, this time, a pleasant, peaceful life\r\nfor me. I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98Is the lost place regained? _Have_ I got\r\nback?\xe2\x80\x99 My mistress died. New people came into our neighborhood. There\r\nwas a young lady among them--my master began to think of another wife.\r\nI have the misfortune (in my situation) to be what is called a handsome\r\nwoman; I rouse the curiosity of strangers. The new people asked\r\nquestions about me; my master\xe2\x80\x99s answers did not satisfy them. In a word,\r\nthey found me out. The old story again! \xe2\x80\x98Mercy, I am very sorry; scandal\r\nis busy with you and with me; we are innocent, but there is no help for\r\nit--we must part.\xe2\x80\x99 I left the place; having gained one advantage during\r\nmy stay in Canada, which I find of use to me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur nearest neighbors were French-Canadians. I learned to speak the\r\nFrench language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you return to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere else could I go, without a character?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy, sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI went\r\nback again to the matron. Sickness had broken out in the Refuge; I made\r\nmyself useful as a nurse. One of the doctors was struck with me--\xe2\x80\x98fell\r\nin love\xe2\x80\x99 with me, as the phrase is. He would have married me. The nurse,\r\nas an honest woman, was bound to tell him the truth. He never appeared\r\nagain. The old story! I began to be weary of saying to myself, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget back! I can\xe2\x80\x99t get back!\xe2\x80\x99 Despair got hold of me, the despair that\r\nhardens the heart. I might have committed suicide; I might even have\r\ndrifted back into my old life--but for one man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those last words her voice--quiet and even through the earlier part\r\nof her sad story--began to falter once more. She stopped, following\r\nsilently the memories and associations roused in her by what she had\r\njust said. Had she forgotten the presence of another person in the room?\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity left Grace no resource but to say a word on her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the man?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did he befriend you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefriend me? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know that such a person as I am is in\r\nexistence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat strange answer, naturally enough, only strengthened the anxiety of\r\nGrace to hear more. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said just now--\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said just now that he saved me. He did save me; you shall hear\r\nhow. One Sunday our regular clergyman at the Refuge was not able to\r\nofficiate. His place was taken by a stranger, quite a young man. The\r\nmatron told us the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s name was Julian Gray. I sat in the back\r\nrow of seats, under the shadow of the gallery, where I could see him\r\nwithout his seeing me. His text was from the words, \xe2\x80\x98Joy shall be in\r\nheaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine\r\njust persons, which need no repentance. \xe2\x80\x98What happier women might have\r\nthought of his sermon I cannot say; there was not a dry eye among us\r\nat the Refuge. As for me, he touched my heart as no man has touched\r\nit before or since. The hard despair melted in me at the sound of his\r\nvoice; the weary round of my life showed its nobler side again while he\r\nspoke. From that time I have accepted my hard lot, I have been a patient\r\nwoman. I might have been something more, I might have been a happy\r\nwoman, if I could have prevailed on myself to speak to Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat hindered you from speaking to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of making my hard life harder still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA woman who could have sympathized with her would perhaps have guessed\r\nwhat those words meant. Grace was simply embarrassed by her; and Grace\r\nfailed to guess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThere was no alternative for Mercy but to own the truth in plain words.\r\nShe sighed, and said the words. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid I might interest him in my\r\nsorrows, and might set my heart on him in return.\xe2\x80\x9d The utter absence\r\nof any fellow-feeling with her on Grace\xe2\x80\x99s side expressed itself\r\nunconsciously in the plainest terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in a tone of blank astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe nurse rose slowly to her feet. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s expression of surprise told\r\nher plainly--almost brutally--that her confession had gone far enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI astonish you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my young lady, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nrough usage a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart can bear, and still beat truly! Before I saw\r\nJulian Gray I only knew men as objects of horror to me. Let us drop\r\nthe subject. The preacher at the Refuge is nothing but a remembrance\r\nnow--the one welcome remembrance of my life! I have nothing more to tell\r\nyou. You insisted on hearing my story--you have heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not heard how you found employment here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, continuing\r\nthe conversation with uneasy politeness, as she best might.\r\n\r\nMercy crossed the room, and slowly raked together the last living embers\r\nof the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matron has friends in France,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwho are connected\r\nwith the military hospitals. It was not difficult to get me the place,\r\nunder those circumstances. Society can find a use for me here. My hand\r\nis as light, my words of comfort are as welcome, among those suffering\r\nwretches\xe2\x80\x9d (she pointed to the room in which the wounded men were lying)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas if I was the most reputable woman breathing. And if a stray shot\r\ncomes my way before the war is over--well! Society will be rid of me on\r\neasy terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood looking thoughtfully into the wreck of the fire--as if she\r\nsaw in it the wreck of her own life. Common humanity made it an act of\r\nnecessity to say something to her. Grace considered--advanced a step\r\ntoward her--stopped--and took refuge in the most trivial of all the\r\ncommon phrases which one human being can address to another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is anything I can do for you--\xe2\x80\x9d she began. The sentence,\r\nhalting there, was never finished. Miss Roseberry was just merciful\r\nenough toward the lost woman who had rescued and sheltered her to feel\r\nthat it was needless to say more.\r\n\r\nThe nurse lifted her noble head and advanced slowly toward the canvas\r\nscreen to return to her duties. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Roseberry might have taken my\r\nhand!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself, bitterly. No! Miss Roseberry stood there\r\nat a distance, at a loss what to say next. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do for\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy asked, stung by the cold courtesy of her companion into a\r\nmomentary outbreak of contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you change my identity? Can you\r\ngive me the name and the place of an innocent woman? If I only had your\r\nchance! If I only had your reputation and your prospects!\xe2\x80\x9d She laid one\r\nhand over her bosom, and controlled herself. \xe2\x80\x9cStay here,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhile I go back to my work. I will see that your clothes are dried. You\r\nshall wear my clothes as short a time as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those melancholy words--touchingly, not bitterly spoken--she moved\r\nto pass into the kitchen, when she noticed that the pattering sound of\r\nthe rain against the window was audible no more. Dropping the canvas for\r\nthe moment, she retraced her steps, and, unfastening the wooden shutter,\r\nlooked out.\r\n\r\nThe moon was rising dimly in the watery sky; the rain had ceased; the\r\nfriendly darkness which had hidden the French position from the German\r\nscouts was lessening every moment. In a few hours more (if nothing\r\nhappened) the English lady might resume her journey. In a few hours more\r\nthe morning would dawn.\r\n\r\nMercy lifted her hand to close the shutter. Before she could fasten it\r\nthe report of a rifle-shot reached the cottage from one of the distant\r\nposts. It was followed almost instantly by a second report, nearer and\r\nlouder than the first. Mercy paused, with the shutter in her hand, and\r\nlistened intently for the next sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE GERMAN SHELL.\r\n\r\nA THIRD rifle-shot rang through the night air, close to the cottage.\r\nGrace started and approached the window in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that firing mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignals from the outposts,\xe2\x80\x9d the nurse quietly replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any danger? Have the Germans come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurgeon Surville answered the question. He lifted the canvas screen, and\r\nlooked into the room as Miss Roseberry spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Germans are advancing on us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir vanguard is in\r\nsight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace sank on the chair near her, trembling from head to foot. Mercy\r\nadvanced to the surgeon, and put the decisive question to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo we defend the position?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\nSurgeon Surville ominously shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible! We are outnumbered as usual--ten to one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shrill roll of the French drums was heard outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the retreat sounded!\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon. \xe2\x80\x9cThe captain is not\r\na man to think twice about what he does. We are left to take care of\r\nourselves. In five minutes we must be out of this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA volley of rifle-shots rang out as he spoke. The German vanguard\r\nwas attacking the French at the outposts. Grace caught the surgeon\r\nentreatingly by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cTake me with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, I have\r\nsuffered from the Germans already! Don\xe2\x80\x99t forsake me, if they come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The surgeon was equal to the occasion; he placed the hand of the pretty\r\nEnglishwoman on his breast. \xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking\r\nas if he could have annihilated the whole German force with his\r\nown invincible arm. \xe2\x80\x9cA Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s heart beats under your hand. A\r\nFrenchman\xe2\x80\x99s devotion protects you.\xe2\x80\x9d Grace\xe2\x80\x99s head sank on his shoulder.\r\nMonsieur Surville felt that he had asserted himself; he looked round\r\ninvitingly at Mercy. She, too, was an attractive woman. The Frenchman\r\nhad another shoulder at _her_ service. Unhappily the room was dark--the\r\nlook was lost on Mercy. She was thinking of the helpless men in the\r\ninner chamber, and she quietly recalled the surgeon to a sense of his\r\nprofessional duties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to become of the sick and wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Surville shrugged one shoulder--the shoulder that was free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe strongest among them we can take away with us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nothers must be left here. Fear nothing for yourself, dear lady. There\r\nwill be a place for you in the baggage-wagon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for me, too?\xe2\x80\x9d Grace pleaded, eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s invincible arm stole round the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and\r\nanswered mutely with a squeeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake her with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cMy place is with the men whom you\r\nleave behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace listened in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cThink what you risk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nstop here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy pointed to her left shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t alarm yourself on my account,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9cthe red cross will\r\nprotect me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother roll of the drum warned the susceptible surgeon to take his\r\nplace as director-general of the ambulance without any further delay. He\r\nconducted Grace to a chair, and placed both her hands on his heart this\r\ntime, to reconcile her to the misfortune of his absence. \xe2\x80\x9cWait here till\r\nI return for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing, my charming friend.\r\nSay to yourself, \xe2\x80\x98Surville is the soul of honor! Surville is devoted to\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He struck his breast; he again forgot the obscurity in the room,\r\nand cast one look of unutterable homage at his charming friend. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\n_bientot!_\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and kissed his hand and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs the canvas screen fell over him the sharp report of the rifle-firing\r\nwas suddenly and grandly dominated by the roar of cannon. The instant\r\nafter a shell exploded in the garden outside, within a few yards of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nGrace sank on her knees with a shriek of terror. Mercy, without losing\r\nher self-possession, advanced to the window and looked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moon has risen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Germans are shelling the village.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace rose, and ran to her for protection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me away!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be killed if we stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstopped, looking in astonishment at the tall black figure of the nurse,\r\nstanding immovably by the window. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you made of iron?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill nothing frighten you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy smiled sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I be afraid of losing my life?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing worth living for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe roar of the cannon shook the cottage for the second time. A second\r\nshell exploded in the courtyard, on the opposite side of the building.\r\n\r\nBewildered by the noise, panic-stricken as the danger from the shells\r\nthreatened the cottage more and more nearly, Grace threw her arms round\r\nthe nurse, and clung, in the abject familiarity of terror, to the woman\r\nwhose hand she had shrunk from touching not five minutes since. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nis it safest?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere can I hide myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell where the next shell will fall?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy answered,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nThe steady composure of the one woman seemed to madden the other.\r\nReleasing the nurse, Grace looked wildly round for a way of escape from\r\nthe cottage. Making first for the kitchen, she was driven back by the\r\nclamor and confusion attending the removal of those among the wounded\r\nwho were strong enough to be placed in the wagon. A second look round\r\nshowed her the door leading into the yard. She rushed to it with a cry\r\nof relief. She had just laid her hand on the lock when the third report\r\nof cannon burst over the place.\r\n\r\nStarting back a step, Grace lifted her hands mechanically to her\r\nears. At the same moment the third shell burst through the roof of the\r\ncottage, and exploded in the room, just inside the door. Mercy sprang\r\nforward, unhurt, from her place at the window. The burning fragments of\r\nthe shell were already firing the dry wooden floor, and in the midst\r\nof them, dimly seen through the smoke, lay the insensible body of her\r\ncompanion in the room. Even at that dreadful moment the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s presence\r\nof mind did not fail her. Hurrying back to the place that she had just\r\nleft, near which she had already noticed the miller\xe2\x80\x99s empty sacks lying\r\nin a heap, she seized two of them, and, throwing them on the smoldering\r\nfloor, trampled out the fire. That done, she knelt by the senseless\r\nwoman, and lifted her head.\r\n\r\nWas she wounded? or dead?\r\n\r\nMercy raised one helpless hand, and laid her fingers on the wrist.\r\nWhile she was still vainly trying to feel for the beating of the pulse,\r\nSurgeon Surville (alarmed for the ladies) hurried in to inquire if any\r\nharm had been done.\r\n\r\nMercy called to him to approach. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid the shell has struck her,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, yielding her place to him. \xe2\x80\x9cSee if she is badly hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety for his charming patient expressed itself briefly\r\nin an oath, with a prodigious emphasis laid on one of the letters in\r\nit--the letter R. \xe2\x80\x9cTake off her cloak,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, raising his hand to\r\nher neck. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor angel! She has turned in falling; the string is twisted\r\nround her throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy removed the cloak. It dropped on the floor as the surgeon lifted\r\nGrace in his arms. \xe2\x80\x9cGet a candle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cthey will give\r\nyou one in the kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d He tried to feel the pulse: his hand trembled,\r\nthe noise and confusion in the kitchen bewildered him. \xe2\x80\x9cJust Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cMy emotions overpower me!\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy approached him with the\r\ncandle. The light disclosed the frightful injury which a fragment of\r\nthe shell had inflicted on the Englishwoman\xe2\x80\x99s head. Surgeon Surville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner altered on the instant. The expression of anxiety left his face;\r\nits professional composure covered it suddenly like a mask. What was the\r\nobject of his admiration now? An inert burden in his arms--nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe change in his face was not lost on Mercy. Her large gray eyes\r\nwatched him attentively. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the lady seriously wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to hold the light any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d was the cool\r\nreply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over--I can do nothing for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurgeon Surville nodded and shook his fist in the direction of the\r\noutposts. \xe2\x80\x9cAccursed Germans!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and looked down at the dead face\r\non his arm, and shrugged his shoulders resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fortune of war!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said as he lifted the body and placed it on the bed in one corner of\r\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x9cNext time, nurse, it may be you or me. Who knows? Bah! the\r\nproblem of human destiny disgusts me.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned from the bed, and\r\nillustrated his disgust by spitting on the fragments of the exploded\r\nshell. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must leave her there,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was once a charming\r\nperson--she is nothing now. Come away, Miss Mercy, before it is too\r\nlate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe offered his arm to the nurse; the creaking of the baggage-wagon,\r\nstarting on its journey, was heard outside, and the shrill roll of the\r\ndrums was renewed in the distance. The retreat had begun.\r\n\r\nMercy drew aside the canvas, and saw the badly wounded men, left\r\nhelpless at the mercy of the enemy, on their straw beds. She refused the\r\noffer of Monsieur Surville\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told you that I shall stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Surville lifted his hands in polite remonstrance. Mercy held\r\nback the curtain, and pointed to the cottage door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mind is made up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven at that final moment the Frenchman asserted himself. He made his\r\nexit with unimpaired grace and dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nsublime!\xe2\x80\x9d With that parting compliment the man of gallantry--true to the\r\nlast to his admiration of the sex--bowed, with his hand on his heart,\r\nand left the cottage.\r\n\r\nMercy dropped the canvas over the doorway. She was alone with the dead\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe last tramp of footsteps, the last rumbling of the wagon wheels, died\r\naway in the distance. No renewal of firing from the position occupied by\r\nthe enemy disturbed the silence that followed. The Germans knew that\r\nthe French were in retreat. A few minutes more and they would take\r\npossession of the abandoned village: the tumult of their approach\r\nshould become audible at the cottage. In the meantime the stillness was\r\nterrible. Even the wounded wretches who were left in the kitchen waited\r\ntheir fate in silence.\r\n\r\nAlone in the room, Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s first look was directed to the bed.\r\n\r\nThe two women had met in the confusion of the first skirmish at the\r\nclose of twilight. Separated, on their arrival at the cottage, by the\r\nduties required of the nurse, they had only met again in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom. The acquaintance between them had been a short one; and it had\r\ngiven no promise of ripening into friendship. But the fatal accident\r\nhad roused Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the stranger. She took the candle, and\r\napproached the corpse of the woman who had been literally killed at her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nShe stood by the bed, looking down in the silence of the night at the\r\nstillness of the dead face.\r\n\r\nIt was a striking face--once seen (in life or in death) not to be\r\nforgotten afterward. The forehead was unusually low and broad; the eyes\r\nunusually far apart; the mouth and chin remarkably small. With tender\r\nhands Mercy smoothed the disheveled hair and arranged the crumpled\r\ndress. \xe2\x80\x9cNot five minutes since,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI was longing\r\nto change places with _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d She turned from the bed with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish I could change places now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe silence began to oppress her. She walked slowly to the other end of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe cloak on the floor--her own cloak, which she had lent to Miss\r\nRoseberry--attracted her attention as she passed it. She picked it up\r\nand brushed the dust from it, and laid it across a chair. This done, she\r\nput the light back on the table, and going to the window, listened for\r\nthe first sounds of the German advance. The faint passage of the wind\r\nthrough some trees near at hand was the only sound that caught her ears.\r\nShe turned from the window, and seated herself at the table, thinking.\r\nWas there any duty still left undone that Christian charity owed to the\r\ndead? Was there any further service that pressed for performance in the\r\ninterval before the Germans appeared?\r\n\r\nMercy recalled the conversation that had passed between her ill-fated\r\ncompanion and herself. Miss Roseberry had spoken of her object in\r\nreturning to England. She had mentioned a lady--a connection by\r\nmarriage, to whom she was personally a stranger--who was waiting to\r\nreceive her. Some one capable of stating how the poor creature had met\r\nwith her death ought to write to her only friend. Who was to do it?\r\nThere was nobody to do it but the one witness of the catastrophe now\r\nleft in the cottage--Mercy herself.\r\n\r\nShe lifted the cloak from the chair on which she had placed it, and took\r\nfrom the pocket the leather letter-case which Grace had shown to her.\r\nThe only way of discovering the address to write to in England was to\r\nopen the case and examine the papers inside. Mercy opened the case--and\r\nstopped, feeling a strange reluctance to carry the investigation any\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nA moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration satisfied her that her scruples were misplaced.\r\nIf she respected the case as inviolable, the Germans would certainly not\r\nhesitate to examine it, and the Germans would hardly trouble themselves\r\nto write to England. Which were the fittest eyes to inspect the papers\r\nof the deceased lady--the eyes of men and foreigners, or the eyes of her\r\nown countrywoman? Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation left her. She emptied the contents\r\nof the case on the table.\r\n\r\nThat trifling action decided the whole future course of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE TEMPTATION.\r\n\r\nSome letters, tied together with a ribbon, attracted Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nfirst. The ink in which the addresses were written had faded with\r\nage. The letters, directed alternately to Colonel Roseberry and to the\r\nHonorable Mrs. Roseberry, contained a correspondence between the husband\r\nand wife at a time when the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s military duties had obliged him to\r\nbe absent from home. Mercy tied the letters up again, and passed on to\r\nthe papers that lay next in order under her hand.\r\n\r\nThese consisted of a few leaves pinned together, and headed (in a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting) \xe2\x80\x9cMy Journal at Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d A brief examination showed\r\nthat the journal had been written by Miss Roseberry, and that it was\r\nmainly devoted to a record of the last days of her father\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nAfter replacing the journal and the correspondence in the case, the one\r\npaper left on the table was a letter. The envelope, which was unclosed,\r\nbore this address: \xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet Roy, Mablethorpe House, Kensington,\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy took the inclosure from the open envelope. The first\r\nlines she read informed her that she had found the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s letter of\r\nintroduction, presenting his daughter to her protectress on her arrival\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nMercy read the letter through. It was described by the writer as the\r\nlast efforts of a dying man. Colonel Roseberry wrote affectionately\r\nof his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s merits, and regretfully of her neglected\r\neducation--ascribing the latter to the pecuniary losses which had\r\nforced him to emigrate to Canada in the character of a poor man. Fervent\r\nexpressions of gratitude followed, addressed to Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cI owe it to\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am dying with my mind at ease about\r\nthe future of my darling girl. To your generous protection I commit the\r\none treasure I have left to me on earth. Through your long lifetime\r\nyou have nobly used your high rank and your great fortune as a means\r\nof doing good. I believe it will not be counted among the least of your\r\nvirtues hereafter that you comforted the last hours of an old soldier by\r\nopening your heart and your home to his friendless child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the letter ended. Mercy laid it down with a heavy heart. What a\r\nchance the poor girl had lost! A woman of rank and fortune waiting to\r\nreceive her--a woman so merciful and so generous that the father\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nhad been easy about the daughter on his deathbed--and there the daughter\r\nlay, beyond the reach of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s kindness, beyond the need of Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s help!\r\n\r\nThe French captain\xe2\x80\x99s writing-materials were left on the table. Mercy\r\nturned the letter over so that she might write the news of Miss\r\nRoseberry\xe2\x80\x99s death on the blank page at the end. She was still\r\nconsidering what expressions she should use, when the sound of\r\ncomplaining voices from the next room caught her ear. The wounded men\r\nleft behind were moaning for help--the deserted soldiers were losing\r\ntheir fortitude at last.\r\n\r\nShe entered the kitchen. A cry of delight welcomed her appearance--the\r\nmere sight of her composed the men. From one straw bed to another she\r\npassed with comforting words that gave them hope, with skilled and\r\ntender hands that soothed their pain. They kissed the hem of her black\r\ndress, they called her their guardian angel, as the beautiful creature\r\nmoved among them, and bent over their hard pillows her gentle,\r\ncompassionate face. \xe2\x80\x9cI will be with you when the Germans come,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, as she left them to return to her unwritten letter. \xe2\x80\x9cCourage, my\r\npoor fellows! you are not deserted by your nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, madam!\xe2\x80\x9d the men replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the firing had been resumed at that moment--if a shell had struck\r\nher dead in the act of succoring the afflicted, what Christian judgment\r\nwould have hesitated to declare that there was a place for this woman\r\nin heaven? But if the war ended and left her still living, where was the\r\nplace for her on earth? Where were her prospects? Where was her home?\r\n\r\nShe returned to the letter. Instead, however, of seating herself to\r\nwrite, she stood by the table, absently looking down at the morsel of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nA strange fancy had sprung to life in her mind on re-entering the room;\r\nshe herself smiled faintly at the extravagance of it. What if she were\r\nto ask Lady Janet Roy to let her supply Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s place? She had\r\nmet with Miss Roseberry under critical circumstances, and she had done\r\nfor her all that one woman could do to help another. There was in this\r\ncircumstance some little claim to notice, perhaps, if Lady Janet had no\r\nother companion and reader in view. Suppose she ventured to plead her\r\nown cause--what would the noble and merciful lady do? She would write\r\nback, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cSend me references to your character, and I will\r\nsee what can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d Her character! Her references! Mercy laughed\r\nbitterly, and sat down to write in the fewest words all that was needed\r\nfrom her--a plain statement of the facts.\r\n\r\nNo! Not a line could she put on the paper. That fancy of hers was not\r\nto be dismissed at will. Her mind was perversely busy now with an\r\nimaginative picture of the beauty of Mablethorpe House and the comfort\r\nand elegance of the life that was led there. Once more she thought of\r\nthe chance which Miss Roseberry had lost. Unhappy creature! what a home\r\nwould have been open to her if the shell had only fallen on the side of\r\nthe window, instead of on the side of the yard!\r\n\r\nMercy pushed the letter away from her, and walked impatiently to and fro\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\nThe perversity in her thoughts was not to be mastered in that way. Her\r\nmind only abandoned one useless train of reflection to occupy itself\r\nwith another. She was now looking by anticipation at her own future.\r\nWhat were her prospects (if she lived through it) when the war was over?\r\nThe experience of the past delineated with pitiless fidelity the dreary\r\nscene. Go where she might, do what she might, it would always end in the\r\nsame way. Curiosity and admiration excited by her beauty; inquiries made\r\nabout her; the story of the past discovered; Society charitably sorry\r\nfor her; Society generously subscribing for her; and still, through all\r\nthe years of her life, the same result in the end--the shadow of the old\r\ndisgrace surrounding her as with a pestilence, isolating her among other\r\nwomen, branding her, even when she had earned her pardon in the sight of\r\nGod, with the mark of an indelible disgrace in the sight of man: there\r\nwas the prospect! And she was only five-and-twenty last birthday; she\r\nwas in the prime of her health and her strength; she might live, in the\r\ncourse of nature, fifty years more!\r\n\r\nShe stopped again at the bedside; she looked again at the face of the\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\nTo what end had the shell struck the woman who had some hope in her\r\nlife, and spared the woman who had none? The words she had herself\r\nspoken to Grace Roseberry came back to her as she thought of it. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nonly had your chance! If I only had your reputation and your prospects!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And there was the chance wasted! there were the enviable prospects\r\nthrown away! It was almost maddening to contemplate that result, feeling\r\nher own position as she felt it. In the bitter mockery of despair she\r\nbent over the lifeless figure, and spoke to it as if it had ears to hear\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, longingly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you could be Mercy Merrick, and if I\r\ncould be Grace Roseberry, _now!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant the words passed her lips she started into an erect\r\nposition. She stood by the bed with her eyes staring wildly into empty\r\nspace; with her brain in a flame; with her heart beating as if it would\r\nstifle her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could be Mercy Merrick, and if I could be Grace\r\nRoseberry, now!\xe2\x80\x9d In one breathless moment the thought assumed a new\r\ndevelopment in her mind. In one breathless moment the conviction struck\r\nher like an electric shock. _She might be Grace Roseberry if she dared!_\r\nThere was absolutely nothing to stop her from presenting herself to Lady\r\nJanet Roy under Grace\xe2\x80\x99s name and in Grace\xe2\x80\x99s place!\r\n\r\nWhat were the risks? Where was the weak point in the scheme?\r\n\r\nGrace had said it herself in so many words--she and Lady Janet had never\r\nseen each other. Her friends were in Canada; her relations in England\r\nwere dead. Mercy knew the place in which she had lived--the place called\r\nPort Logan--as well as she had known it herself. Mercy had only to read\r\nthe manuscript journal to be able to answer any questions relating to\r\nthe visit to Rome and to Colonel Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s death. She had no\r\naccomplished lady to personate: Grace had spoken herself--her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter spoke also in the plainest terms--of her neglected education.\r\nEverything, literally everything, was in the lost woman\xe2\x80\x99s favor. The\r\npeople with whom she had been connected in the ambulance had gone,\r\nto return no more. Her own clothes were on Miss Roseberry at that\r\nmoment--marked with her own name. Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, marked with\r\n_her_ name, were drying, at Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s disposal, in the next room. The way\r\nof escape from the unendurable humiliation of her present life lay open\r\nbefore her at last. What a prospect it was! A new identity, which she\r\nmight own anywhere! a new name, which was beyond reproach! a new past\r\nlife, into which all the world might search, and be welcome! Her color\r\nrose, her eyes sparkled; she had never been so irresistibly beautiful as\r\nshe looked at the moment when the new future disclosed itself, radiant\r\nwith new hope.\r\n\r\nShe waited a minute, until she could look at her own daring project from\r\nanother point of view. Where was the harm of it? what did her conscience\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nAs to Grace, in the first place. What injury was she doing to a woman\r\nwho was dead? The question answered itself. No injury to the woman. No\r\ninjury to her relations. Her relations were dead also.\r\n\r\nAs to Lady Janet, in the second place. If she served her new mistress\r\nfaithfully, if she filled her new sphere honorably, if she was diligent\r\nunder instruction and grateful for kindness--if, in one word, she was\r\nall that she might be and would be in the heavenly peace and security\r\nof that new life--what injury was she doing to Lady Janet? Once more the\r\nquestion answered itself. She might, and would, give Lady Janet cause to\r\nbless the day when she first entered the house.\r\n\r\nShe snatched up Colonel Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and put it into the case\r\nwith the other papers. The opportunity was before her; the chances were\r\nall in her favor; her conscience said nothing against trying the daring\r\nscheme. She decided then and there--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething jarred on her finer sense, something offended her better\r\nnature, as she put the case into the pocket of her dress. She had\r\ndecided, and yet she was not at ease; she was not quite sure of having\r\nfairly questioned her conscience yet. What if she laid the letter-case\r\non the table again, and waited until her excitement had all cooled down,\r\nand then put the contemplated project soberly on its trial before her\r\nown sense of right and wrong?\r\n\r\nShe thought once--and hesitated. Before she could think twice, the\r\ndistant tramp of marching footsteps and the distant clatter of horses\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhoofs were wafted to her on the night air. The Germans were entering the\r\nvillage! In a few minutes more they would appear in the cottage; they\r\nwould summon her to give an account of herself. There was no time for\r\nwaiting until she was composed again. Which should it be--the new life,\r\nas Grace Roseberry? or the old life, as Mercy Merrick?\r\n\r\nShe looked for the last time at the bed. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s course was run; Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuture was at her disposal. Her resolute nature, forced to a choice\r\non the instant, held by the daring alternative. She persisted in the\r\ndetermination to take Grace\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n\r\nThe tramping footsteps of the Germans came nearer and nearer. The voices\r\nof the officers were audible, giving the words of command.\r\n\r\nShe seated herself at the table, waiting steadily for what was to come.\r\n\r\nThe ineradicable instinct of the sex directed her eyes to her dress,\r\nbefore the Germans appeared. Looking it over to see that it was in\r\nperfect order, her eyes fell upon the red cross on her left shoulder. In\r\na moment it struck her that her nurse\xe2\x80\x99s costume might involve her in a\r\nneedless risk. It associated her with a public position; it might lead\r\nto inquiries at a later time, and those inquiries might betray her.\r\n\r\nShe looked round. The gray cloak which she had lent to Grace attracted\r\nher attention. She took it up, and covered herself with it from head to\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe cloak was just arranged round her when she heard the outer door\r\nthrust open, and voices speaking in a strange tongue, and arms grounded\r\nin the room behind her. Should she wait to be discovered? or should she\r\nshow herself of her own accord? It was less trying to such a nature as\r\nhers to show herself than to wait. She advanced to enter the kitchen.\r\nThe canvas curtain, as she stretched out her hand to it, was suddenly\r\ndrawn back from the other side, and three men confronted her in the open\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE GERMAN SURGEON.\r\n\r\nTHE youngest of the three strangers--judging by features, complexion,\r\nand manner--was apparently an Englishman. He wore a military cap and\r\nmilitary boots, but was otherwise dressed as a civilian. Next to him\r\nstood an officer in Prussian uniform, and next to the officer was the\r\nthird and the oldest of the party. He also was dressed in uniform, but\r\nhis appearance was far from being suggestive of the appearance of a\r\nmilitary man. He halted on one foot, he stooped at the shoulders, and\r\ninstead of a sword at his side he carried a stick in his hand. After\r\nlooking sharply through a large pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, first\r\nat Mercy, then at the bed, then all round the room, he turned with\r\na cynical composure of manner to the Prussian officer, and broke the\r\nsilence in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman ill on the bed; another woman in attendance on her, and no one\r\nelse in the room. Any necessity, major, for setting a guard here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the major. He wheeled round on his heel and\r\nreturned to the kitchen. The German surgeon advanced a little, led by\r\nhis professional instinct, in the direction of the bedside. The young\r\nEnglishman, whose eyes had remained riveted in admiration on Mercy, drew\r\nthe canvas screen over the doorway and respectfully addressed her in the\r\nFrench language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask if I am speaking to a French lady?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an Englishwoman,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy replied.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon heard the answer. Stopping short on his way to the bed,\r\nhe pointed to the recumbent figure on it, and said to Mercy, in good\r\nEnglish, spoken with a strong German accent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be of any use there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis manner was ironically courteous, his harsh voice was pitched in one\r\nsardonic monotony of tone. Mercy took an instantaneous dislike to\r\nthis hobbling, ugly old man, staring at her rudely through his great\r\ntortoiseshell spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can be of no use, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lady was killed\r\nwhen your troops shelled this cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman started, and looked compassionately toward the bed.\r\nThe German refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff, and put another\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the body been examined by a medical man?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMercy ungraciously limited her reply to the one necessary word \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe present surgeon was not a man to be daunted by a lady\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval\r\nof him. He went on with his questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has examined the body?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired next.\r\n\r\nMercy answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor attached to the French ambulance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe German grunted in contemptuous disapproval of all Frenchmen, and\r\nall French institutions. The Englishman seized his first opportunity of\r\naddressing himself to Mercy once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the lady a countrywoman of ours?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, gently.\r\n\r\nMercy considered before she answered him. With the object she had in\r\nview, there might be serious reasons for speaking with extreme caution\r\nwhen she spoke of Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe met here by accident. I know nothing of\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even her name?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the German surgeon.\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s resolution was hardly equal yet to giving her own name openly as\r\nthe name of Grace. She took refuge in flat denial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even her name,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated obstinately.\r\n\r\nThe old man stared at her more rudely than ever, considered with\r\nhimself, and took the candle from the table. He hobbled back to the bed\r\nand examined the figure laid on it in silence. The Englishman continued\r\nthe conversation, no longer concealing the interest that he felt in the\r\nbeautiful woman who stood before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very young to be alone in war-time in\r\nsuch a place as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sudden outbreak of a disturbance in the kitchen relieved Mercy from\r\nany immediate necessity for answering him. She heard the voices of the\r\nwounded men raised in feeble remonstrance, and the harsh command of the\r\nforeign officers bidding them be silent. The generous instincts of the\r\nwoman instantly prevailed over every personal consideration imposed on\r\nher by the position which she had assumed. Reckless whether she betrayed\r\nherself or not as nurse in the French ambulance, she instantly drew\r\naside the canvas to enter the kitchen. A German sentinel barred the\r\nway to her, and announced, in his own language, that no strangers were\r\nadmitted. The Englishman politely interposing, asked if she had any\r\nspecial object in wishing to enter the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor Frenchmen!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, earnestly, her heart upbraiding her for\r\nhaving forgotten them. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor wounded Frenchmen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe German surgeon advanced from the bedside, and took the matter up\r\nbefore the Englishman could say a word more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing to do with the wounded Frenchmen,\xe2\x80\x9d he croaked, in the\r\nharshest notes of his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wounded Frenchmen are my business, and\r\nnot yours. They are _our_ prisoners, and they are being moved to _our_\r\nambulance. I am Ingatius Wetzel, chief of the medical staff--and I tell\r\nyou this. Hold your tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to the sentinel and added in\r\nGerman, \xe2\x80\x9cDraw the curtain again; and if the woman persists, put her back\r\ninto this room with your own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy attempted to remonstrate. The Englishman respectfully took her\r\narm, and drew her out of the sentinel\xe2\x80\x99s reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless to resist,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe German discipline never gives\r\nway. There is not the least need to be uneasy about the Frenchmen. The\r\nambulance under Surgeon Wetzel is admirably administered. I answer for\r\nit, the men will be well treated.\xe2\x80\x9d He saw the tears in her eyes as he\r\nspoke; his admiration for her rose higher and higher. \xe2\x80\x9cKind as well as\r\nbeautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a charming creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ignatius Wetzel, eying Mercy sternly through his\r\nspectacles. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you satisfied? And will you hold your tongue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe yielded: it was plainly useless to resist. But for the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresistance, her devotion to the wounded men might have stopped her\r\non the downward way that she was going. If she could only have been\r\nabsorbed again, mind and body, in her good work as a nurse, the\r\ntemptation might even yet have found her strong enough to resist it. The\r\nfatal severity of the German discipline had snapped asunder the last tie\r\nthat bound her to her better self. Her face hardened as she walked away\r\nproudly from Surgeon Wetzel, and took a chair.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman followed her, and reverted to the question of her present\r\nsituation in the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that I want to alarm you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is, I repeat,\r\nno need to be anxious about the Frenchmen, but there is serious reason\r\nfor anxiety on your own account. The action will be renewed round this\r\nvillage by daylight; you ought really to be in a place of safety. I am\r\nan officer in the English army--my name is Horace Holmcroft. I shall be\r\ndelighted to be of use to you, and I _can_ be of use, if you will let\r\nme. May I ask if you are traveling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy gathered the cloak which concealed her nurse\xe2\x80\x99s dress more closely\r\nround her, and committed herself silently to her first overt act of\r\ndeception. She bowed her head in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you on your way to England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case I can pass you through the German lines, and forward you\r\nat once on your journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy looked at him in unconcealed surprise. His strongly-felt interest\r\nin her was restrained within the strictest limits of good-breeding: he\r\nwas unmistakably a gentleman. Did he really mean what he had just said?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can pass me through the German lines?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\npossess extraordinary influence, sir, to be able to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Holmcroft smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI possess the influence that no one can resist,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered--\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ninfluence of the Press. I am serving here as war correspondent of one of\r\nour great English newspapers. If I ask him, the commanding officer will\r\ngrant you a pass. He is close to this cottage. What do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe summoned her resolution--not without difficulty, even now--and took\r\nhim at his word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gratefully accept your offer, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advanced a step toward the kitchen, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be well to make the application as privately as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be questioned if I pass through that room. Is there no\r\nother way out of the cottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy showed him the door leading into the yard. He bowed--and left her.\r\n\r\nShe looked furtively toward the German surgeon. Ignatius Wetzel was\r\nstill at the bed, bending over the body, and apparently absorbed in\r\nexamining the wound which had been inflicted by the shell. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstinctive aversion to the old man increased tenfold, now that she was\r\nleft alone with him. She withdrew uneasily to the window, and looked out\r\nat the moonlight.\r\n\r\nHad she committed herself to the fraud? Hardly, yet. She had committed\r\nherself to returning to England--nothing more. There was no necessity,\r\nthus far, which forced her to present herself at Mablethorpe House, in\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s place. There was still time to reconsider her resolution--still\r\ntime to write the account of the accident, as she had proposed, and\r\nto send it with the letter-case to Lady Janet Roy. Suppose she finally\r\ndecided on taking this course, what was to become of her when she found\r\nherself in England again? There was no alternative open but to apply\r\nonce more to her friend the matron. There was nothing for her to do but\r\nto return to the Refuge!\r\n\r\nThe Refuge! The matron! What past association with these two was now\r\npresenting itself uninvited, and taking the foremost place in her mind?\r\nOf whom was she now thinking, in that strange place, and at that crisis\r\nin her life? Of the man whose words had found their way to her heart,\r\nwhose influence had strengthened and comforted her, in the chapel of\r\nthe Refuge. One of the finest passages in his sermon had been especially\r\ndevoted by Julian Gray to warning the congregation whom he addressed\r\nagainst the degrading influences of falsehood and deceit. The terms\r\nin which he had appealed to the miserable women round him--terms of\r\nsympathy and encouragement never addressed to them before--came back to\r\nMercy Merrick as if she had heard them an hour since. She turned deadly\r\npale as they now pleaded with her once more. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to\r\nherself, as she thought of what she had proposed and planned, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have\r\nI done? what have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned from the window with some vague idea in her mind of following\r\nMr. Holmcroft and calling him back. As she faced the bed again she also\r\nconfronted Ignatius Wetzel. He was just stepping forward to speak to\r\nher, with a white handkerchief--the handkerchief which she had lent to\r\nGrace--held up in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found this in her pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is her name written on\r\nit. She must be a countrywoman of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d He read the letters marked on\r\nthe handkerchief with some difficulty. \xe2\x80\x9cHer name is--Mercy Merrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_His_ lips had said it--not hers! _He_ had given her the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mercy Merrick\xe2\x80\x99 is an English name?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Ignatius Wetzel, with his\r\neyes steadily fixed on her. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hold on her mind of the past association with Julian Gray began to\r\nrelax. One present and pressing question now possessed itself of the\r\nforemost place in her thoughts. Should she correct the error into which\r\nthe German had fallen? The time had come--to speak, and assert her own\r\nidentity; or to be silent, and commit herself to the fraud.\r\n\r\nHorace Holmcroft entered the room again at the moment when Surgeon\r\nWetzel\xe2\x80\x99s staring eyes were still fastened on her, waiting for her reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not overrated my interest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to a little slip\r\nof paper in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the pass. Have you got pen and ink? I\r\nmust fill up the form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy pointed to the writing materials on the table. Horace seated\r\nhimself, and dipped the pen in the ink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I wish to intrude myself into your affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to ask you one or two plain questions. What is your\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden trembling seized her. She supported herself against the foot\r\nof the bed. Her whole future existence depended on her answer. She was\r\nincapable of uttering a word.\r\n\r\nIgnatius Wetzel stood her friend for once. His croaking voice filled\r\nthe empty gap of silence exactly at the right time. He doggedly held the\r\nhandkerchief under her eyes. He obstinately repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cMercy Merrick is\r\nan English name. Is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace Holmcroft looked up from the table. \xe2\x80\x9cMercy Merrick?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Mercy Merrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurgeon Wetzel pointed to the corpse on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found the name on the handkerchief,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis lady,\r\nit seems, had not curiosity enough to look for the name of her own\r\ncountrywoman.\xe2\x80\x9d He made that mocking allusion to Mercy with a tone which\r\nwas almost a tone of suspicion, and a look which was almost a look of\r\ncontempt. Her quick temper instantly resented the discourtesy of which\r\nshe had been made the object. The irritation of the moment--so often\r\ndo the most trifling motives determine the most serious human\r\nactions--decided her on the course that she should pursue. She turned\r\nher back scornfully on the rude old man, and left him in the delusion\r\nthat he had discovered the dead woman\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nHorace returned to the business of filling up the form. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for\r\npressing the question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what German discipline is by\r\nthis time. What is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered him recklessly, defiantly, without fairly realizing what\r\nshe was doing until it was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace Roseberry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth before she would have given\r\neverything she possessed in the world to recall them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Horace, smiling.\r\n\r\nShe could only answer him by bowing her head.\r\n\r\nHe wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grace Roseberry\xe2\x80\x9d--reflected for a moment--and then\r\nadded, interrogatively, \xe2\x80\x9cReturning to her friends in England?\xe2\x80\x9d Her\r\nfriends in England? Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s heart swelled: she silently replied by\r\nanother sign. He wrote the words after the name, and shook the sandbox\r\nover the wet ink. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will be enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rising and presenting\r\nthe pass to Mercy; \xe2\x80\x9cI will see you through the lines myself, and arrange\r\nfor your being sent on by the railway. Where is your luggage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy pointed toward the front door of the building. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a shed outside\r\nthe cottage,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not much; I can do everything for\r\nmyself if the sentinel will let me pass through the kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace pointed to the paper in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can go where you like\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I wait for you here or outside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy glanced distrustfully at Ignatius Wetzel. He was again absorbed\r\nin his endless examination of the body on the bed. If she left him alone\r\nwith Mr. Holmcroft, there was no knowing what the hateful old man might\r\nnot say of her. She answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait for me outside, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sentinel drew back with a military salute at the sight of the pass.\r\nAll the French prisoners had been removed; there were not more than\r\nhalf-a-dozen Germans in the kitchen, and the greater part of them were\r\nasleep. Mercy took Grace Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s clothes from the corner in which\r\nthey had been left to dry, and made for the shed--a rough structure of\r\nwood, built out from the cottage wall. At the front door she encountered\r\na second sentinel, and showed her pass for the second time. She spoke\r\nto this man, asking him if he understood French. He answered that he\r\nunderstood a little. Mercy gave him a piece of money, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to pack up my luggage in the shed. Be kind enough to see that\r\nnobody disturbs me.\xe2\x80\x9d The sentinel saluted, in token that he understood.\r\nMercy disappeared in the dark interior of the shed.\r\n\r\nLeft alone with Surgeon Wetzel, Horace noticed the strange old man still\r\nbending intently over the English lady who had been killed by the shell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cin the manner of that poor creature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to put in a newspaper,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the cynic, pursuing his\r\ninvestigations as attentively as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInteresting to a doctor--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Horace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Interesting to a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d was the gruff reply.\r\n\r\nHorace good-humoredly accepted the hint implied in those words. He\r\nquitted the room by the door leading into the yard, and waited for the\r\ncharming Englishwoman, as he had been instructed, outside the cottage.\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Ignatius Wetzel, after a first cautious look all round\r\nhim, opened the upper part of Grace\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and laid his left hand on\r\nher heart. Taking a little steel instrument from his waistcoat pocket\r\nwith the other hand, he applied it carefully to the wound, raised a\r\nmorsel of the broken and depressed bone of the skull, and waited for the\r\nresult. \xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, addressing with a terrible gayety the\r\nsenseless creature under his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Frenchman says you are dead,\r\nmy dear--does he? The Frenchman is a Quack! The Frenchman is an Ass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He lifted his head, and called into the kitchen. \xe2\x80\x9cMax!\xe2\x80\x9d A sleepy young\r\nGerman, covered with a dresser\xe2\x80\x99s apron from his chin to his feet, drew\r\nthe curtain, and waited for his instructions. \xe2\x80\x9cBring me my black bag,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Ignatius Wetzel. Having given that order, he rubbed his hands\r\ncheerfully, and shook himself like a dog. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I am quite happy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n croaked the terrible old man, with his fierce eyes leering sidelong\r\nat the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, dead Englishwoman, I would not have missed this\r\nmeeting with you for all the money I have in the world. Ha! you infernal\r\nFrench Quack, you call it death, do you? I call it suspended animation\r\nfrom pressure on the brain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMax appeared with the black bag.\r\n\r\nIgnatius Wetzel selected two fearful instruments, bright and new, and\r\nhugged them to his bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cMy little boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, tenderly, as if\r\nthey were his children; \xe2\x80\x9cmy blessed little boys, come to work!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nturned to the assistant. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember the battle of Solferino,\r\nMax--and the Austrian soldier I operated on for a wound on the head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe assistant\xe2\x80\x99s sleepy eyes opened wide; he was evidently interested. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nremember,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI held the candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe master led the way to the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not satisfied with the result of that operation at Solferino,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cI have wanted to try again ever since. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that I saved the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s life, but I failed to give him back his reason along with it. It\r\nmight have been something wrong in the operation, or it might have been\r\nsomething wrong in the man. Whichever it was, he will live and die mad.\r\nNow look here, my little Max, at this dear young lady on the bed. She\r\ngives me just what I wanted; here is the case at Solferino once more.\r\nYou shall hold the candle again, my good boy; stand there, and look with\r\nall your eyes. I am going to try if I can save the life and the reason\r\ntoo this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tucked up the cuffs of his coat and began the operation. As his\r\nfearful instruments touched Grace\xe2\x80\x99s head, the voice of the sentinel at\r\nthe nearest outpost was heard, giving the word in German which permitted\r\nMercy to take the first step on her journey to England:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass the English lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe operation proceeded. The voice of the sentinel at the next post was\r\nheard more faintly, in its turn: \xe2\x80\x9cPass the English lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe operation ended. Ignatius Wetzel held up his hand for silence and\r\nput his ear close to the patient\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\r\n\r\nThe first trembling breath of returning life fluttered over Grace\r\nRoseberry\xe2\x80\x99s lips and touched the old man\xe2\x80\x99s wrinkled cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cGood girl! you breathe--you live!\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke, the voice of the\r\nsentinel at the final limit of the German lines (barely audible in the\r\ndistance) gave the word for the last time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass the English lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SCENE.--Mablethorpe House.\r\n\r\nPREAMBLE.\r\n\r\nTHE place is England.\r\n\r\nThe time is winter, in the year eighteen hundred and seventy.\r\n\r\nThe persons are, Julian Gray, Horace Holmcroft, Lady Janet Roy, Grace\r\nRoseberry, and Mercy Merrick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. LADY JANET\xe2\x80\x99S COMPANION.\r\n\r\nIT is a glorious winter\xe2\x80\x99s day. The sky is clear, the frost is hard, the\r\nice bears for skating.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room of the ancient mansion called Mablethorpe House,\r\nsituated in the London suburb of Kensington, is famous among artists\r\nand other persons of taste for the carved wood-work, of Italian origin,\r\nwhich covers the walls on three sides. On the fourth side the march of\r\nmodern improvement has broken in, and has va ried and brightened the\r\nscene by means of a conservatory, forming an entrance to the room\r\nthrough a winter-garden of rare plants and flowers. On your right hand,\r\nas you stand fronting the conservatory, the monotony of the paneled wall\r\nis relieved by a quaintly patterned door of old inlaid wood, leading\r\ninto the library, and thence, across the great hall, to the other\r\nreception-rooms of the house. A corresponding door on the left hand\r\ngives access to the billiard-room, to the smoking-room next to it,\r\nand to a smaller hall commanding one of the secondary entrances to the\r\nbuilding. On the left side also is the ample fireplace, surmounted by\r\nits marble mantelpiece, carved in the profusely and confusedly ornate\r\nstyle of eighty years since. To the educated eye the dining-room, with\r\nits modern furniture and conservatory, its ancient walls and doors,\r\nand its lofty mantelpiece (neither very old nor very new), presents a\r\nstartling, almost a revolutionary, mixture of the decorative workmanship\r\nof widely differing schools. To the ignorant eye the one result\r\nproduced is an impression of perfect luxury and comfort, united in the\r\nfriendliest combination, and developed on the largest scale.\r\n\r\nThe clock has just struck two. The table is spread for luncheon.\r\n\r\nThe persons seated at the table are three in number. First, Lady Janet\r\nRoy. Second, a young lady who is her reader and companion. Third, a\r\nguest staying in the house, who has already appeared in these pages\r\nunder the name of Horace Holmcroft--attached to the German army as war\r\ncorrespondent of an English newspaper.\r\n\r\nLady Janet Roy needs but little introduction. Everybody with the\r\nslightest pretension to experience in London society knows Lady Janet\r\nRoy.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of her old lace and her priceless rubies? Who has not\r\nadmired her commanding figure, her beautifully dressed white hair, her\r\nwonderful black eyes, which still preserve their youthful brightness,\r\nafter first opening on the world seventy years since? Who has not felt\r\nthe charm of her frank, easily flowing talk, her inexhaustible spirits,\r\nher good-humored, gracious sociability of manner? Where is the modern\r\nhermit who is not familiarly acquainted, by hearsay at least, with\r\nthe fantastic novelty and humor of her opinions; with her generous\r\nencouragement of rising merit of any sort, in all ranks, high or low;\r\nwith her charities, which know no distinction between abroad and at\r\nhome; with her large indulgence, which no ingratitude can discourage,\r\nand no servility pervert? Everybody has heard of the popular old\r\nlady--the childless widow of a long-forgotten lord. Everybody knows Lady\r\nJanet Roy.\r\n\r\nBut who knows the handsome young woman sitting on her right hand,\r\nplaying with her luncheon instead of eating it? Nobody really knows her.\r\n\r\nShe is prettily dressed in gray poplin, trimmed with gray velvet, and\r\nset off by a ribbon of deep red tied in a bow at the throat. She is\r\nnearly as tall as Lady Janet herself, and possesses a grace and beauty\r\nof figure not always seen in women who rise above the medium height.\r\nJudging by a certain innate grandeur in the carriage of her head and in\r\nthe expression of her large melancholy gray eyes, believers in blood and\r\nbreeding will be apt to guess that this is another noble lady. Alas! she\r\nis nothing but Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s companion and reader. Her head, crowned with\r\nits lovely light brown hair, bends with a gentle respect when Lady Janet\r\nspeaks. Her fine firm hand is easily and incessantly watchful to supply\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s slightest wants. The old lady--affectionately familiar\r\nwith her--speaks to her as she might speak to an adopted child. But the\r\ngratitude of the beautiful companion has always the same restraint in\r\nits acknowledgment of kindness; the smile of the beautiful companion\r\nhas always the same underlying sadness when it responds to Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhearty laugh. Is there something wrong here, under the surface? Is she\r\nsuffering in mind, or suffering in body? What is the matter with her?\r\n\r\nThe matter with her is secret remorse. This delicate and beautiful\r\ncreature pines under the slow torment of constant self-reproach.\r\n\r\nTo the mistress of the house, and to all who inhabit it or enter it,\r\nshe is known as Grace Roseberry, the orphan relative by marriage of Lady\r\nJanet Roy. To herself alone she is known as the outcast of the London\r\nstreets; the inmate of the London Refuge; the lost woman who has stolen\r\nher way back--after vainly trying to fight her way back--to Home and\r\nName. There she sits in the grim shadow of her own terrible secret,\r\ndisguised in another person\xe2\x80\x99s identity, and established in another\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s place. Mercy Merrick had only to dare, and to become Grace\r\nRoseberry if she pleased. She has dared, and she has been Grace\r\nRoseberry for nearly four months past.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, while Lady Janet is talking to Horace Holmcroft,\r\nsomething that has passed between them has set her thinking of the day\r\nwhen she took the first fatal step which committed her to the fraud.\r\n\r\nHow marvelously easy of accomplishment the act of personation had been!\r\nAt first sight Lady Janet had yielded to the fascination of the noble\r\nand interesting face. No need to present the stolen letter; no need\r\nto repeat the ready-made story. The old lady had put the letter aside\r\nunopened, and had stopped the story at the first words. \xe2\x80\x9cYour face is\r\nyour introduction, my dear; your father can say nothing for you which\r\nyou have not already said for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d There was the welcome which\r\nestablished her firmly in her false identity at the outset. Thanks\r\nto her own experience, and thanks to the \xe2\x80\x9cJournal\xe2\x80\x9d of events at\r\nRome, questions about her life in Canada and questions about Colonel\r\nRoseberry\xe2\x80\x99s illness found her ready with answers which (even if\r\nsuspicion had existed) would have disarmed suspicion on the spot. While\r\nthe true Grace was slowly and painfully winning her way back to life\r\non her bed in a German hospital, the false Grace was presented to\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s friends as the relative by marriage of the Mistress of\r\nMablethorpe House. From that time forward nothing had happened to rouse\r\nin her the faintest suspicion that Grace Roseberry was other than a\r\ndead-and-buried woman. So far as she now knew--so far as any one now\r\nknew--she might live out her life in perfect security (if her conscience\r\nwould let her), respected, distinguished, and beloved, in the position\r\nwhich she had usurped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe rose abruptly from the table. The effort of her life was to shake\r\nherself free of the remembrances which haunted her perpetually as they\r\nwere haunting her now. Her memory was her worst enemy; her one refuge\r\nfrom it was in change of occupation and change of scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I go into the conservatory, Lady Janet?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent her head to her protectress, looked for a moment with a steady,\r\ncompassionate attention at Horace Holmcroft, and, slowly crossing the\r\nroom, entered the winter-garden. The eyes of Horace followed her, as\r\nlong as she was in view, with a curious contradictory expression\r\nof admiration and disapproval. When she had passed out of sight the\r\nadmiration vanished, but the disapproval remained. The face of the young\r\nman contracted into a frown: he sat silent, with his fork in his hand,\r\nplaying absently with the fragments on his plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake some French pie, Horace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome more chicken, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more chicken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill nothing tempt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take some more wine, if you will allow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe filled his glass (for the fifth or sixth time) with claret, and\r\nemptied it sullenly at a draught. Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s bright eyes watched him\r\nwith sardonic attention; Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s ready tongue spoke out as freely\r\nas usual what was passing in her mind at the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe air of Kensington doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to suit you, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe longer you have been my guest, the oftener you fill your\r\nglass and empty your cigar-case. Those are bad signs in a young man.\r\nWhen you first came here you arrived invalided by a wound. In your\r\nplace, I should not have exposed myself to be shot, with no other\r\nobject in view than describing a battle in a newspaper. I suppose tastes\r\ndiffer. Are you ill? Does your wound still plague you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you out of spirits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace Holmcroft dropped his fork, rested his elbows on the table, and\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s large toleration had its limits. It embraced every\r\nhuman offense except a breach of good manners. She snatched up the\r\nnearest weapon of correction at hand--a tablespoon--and rapped her young\r\nfriend smartly with it on the arm that was nearest to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy table is not the club table,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cHold up your head.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t look at your fork--look at me. I allow nobody to be out of spirits\r\nin My house. I consider it to be a reflection on Me. If our quiet life\r\nhere doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit you, say so plainly, and find something else to do.\r\nThere is employment to be had, I suppose--if you choose to apply for it?\r\nYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t smile. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see your teeth--I want an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace admitted, with all needful gravity, that there was employment to\r\nbe had. The war between France and Germany, he remarked, was still going\r\non: the newspaper had offered to employ him again in the capacity of\r\ncorrespondent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak of the newspapers and the war!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Janet, with a\r\nsudden explosion of anger, which was genuine anger this time. \xe2\x80\x9cI detest\r\nthe newspapers! I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow the newspapers to enter this house. I lay\r\nthe whole blame of the blood shed between France and Germany at their\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened wide in amazement. The old lady was evidently in\r\nearnest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you possibly mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAre the newspapers\r\nresponsible for the war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntirely responsible,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nthe age you live in! Does anybody do anything nowadays (fighting\r\nincluded) without wishing to see it in the newspapers? _I_ subscribe\r\nto a charity; _thou_ art presented with a testimonial; _he_ preaches a\r\nsermon; _we_ suffer a grievance; _you_ make a discovery; _they_ go to\r\nchurch and get married. And I, thou, he; we, you, they, all want one and\r\nthe same thing--we want to see it in the papers. Are kings, soldiers,\r\nand diplomatists exceptions to the general rule of humanity? Not they! I\r\ntell you seriously, if the newspapers of Europe had one and all decided\r\nnot to take the smallest notice in print of the war between France and\r\nGermany, it is my firm conviction the war would have come to an end for\r\nwant of encouragement long since. Let the pen cease to advertise the\r\nsword, and I, for one, can see the result. No report--no fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour views have the merit of perfect novelty, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Horace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you object to see them in the newspapers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet worsted her young friend with his own weapons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I live in the latter part of the nineteenth century?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the newspapers, did you say? In large type, Horace, if you love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou blame me for being out of spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand you seem to think\r\nit is because I am tired of my pleasant life at Mablethorpe House. I am\r\nnot in the least tired, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked toward the conservatory:\r\nthe frown showed itself on his face once more. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nresumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not satisfied with Grace Roseberry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has Grace done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe persists in prolonging our engagement. Nothing will persuade her to\r\nfix the day for our marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was true! Mercy had been mad enough to listen to him, and to\r\nlove him. But Mercy was not vile enough to marry him under her false\r\ncharacter, and in her false name. Between three and four months had\r\nelapsed since Horace had been sent home from the war, wounded, and\r\nhad found the beautiful Englishwoman whom he had befriended in France\r\nestablished at Mablethorpe House. Invited to become Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nguest (he had passed his holidays as a school-boy under Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroof)--free to spend the idle time of his convalescence from morning to\r\nnight in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s society--the impression originally produced on him in\r\na French cottage soon strengthened into love. Before the month was out\r\nHorace had declared himself, and had discovered that he spoke to willing\r\nears. From that moment it was only a question of persisting long\r\nenough in the resolution to gain his point. The marriage engagement was\r\nratified--most reluctantly on the lady\xe2\x80\x99s side--and there the further\r\nprogress of Horace Holmcroft\xe2\x80\x99s suit came to an end. Try as he might, he\r\nfailed to persuade his betrothed wife to fix the day for the marriage.\r\nThere were no obstacles in her way. She had no near relations of her own\r\nto consult. As a connection of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s by marriage, Horace\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\nand sisters were ready to receive her with all the honors due to a new\r\nmember of the family. No pecuniary considerations made it necessary, in\r\nthis case, to wait for a favorable time. Horace was an only son; and he\r\nhad succeeded to his father\xe2\x80\x99s estate with an ample income to support\r\nit. On both sides alike there was absolutely nothing to prevent the\r\ntwo young people from being married as soon as the settlements could\r\nbe drawn. And yet, to all appearance, here was a long engagement\r\nin prospect, with no better reason than the lady\xe2\x80\x99s incomprehensible\r\nperversity to explain the delay. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you account for Grace\xe2\x80\x99s conduct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked Lady Janet. Her manner changed as she put the question. She looked\r\nand spoke like a person who was perplexed and annoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly like to own it,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am afraid she has\r\nsome motive for deferring our marriage which she cannot confide either\r\nto you or to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have once or twice caught her in tears. Every now and then--sometimes\r\nwhen she is talking quite gayly--she suddenly changes color and becomes\r\nsilent and depressed. Just now, when she left the table (didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nnotice it?), she looked at me in the strangest way--almost as if she was\r\nsorry for me. What do these things mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s reply, instead of increasing Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety, seemed to\r\nrelieve it. He had observed nothing which she had not noticed herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou foolish boy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe meaning is plain enough. Grace has\r\nbeen out of health for some time past. The doctor recommends change of\r\nair. I shall take her away with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be more to the purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cif I took her away\r\nwith me. She might consent, if you would only use your influence. Is\r\nit asking too much to ask you to persuade her? My mother and my sisters\r\nhave written to her, and have produced no effect. Do me the greatest of\r\nall kindnesses--speak to her to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and possessing himself\r\nof Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s hand, pressed it entreatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have always been so\r\ngood to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, softly, and pressed it again.\r\n\r\nThe old lady looked at him. It was impossible to dispute that there were\r\nattractions in Horace Holmcroft\xe2\x80\x99s face which made it well worth looking\r\nat. Many a woman might have envied him his clear complexion, his\r\nbright blue eyes, and the warm amber tint in his light Saxon hair.\r\nMen--especially men skilled in observing physiognomy--might have noticed\r\nin the shape of his forehead and in the line of his upper lip the signs\r\nindicative of a moral nature deficient in largeness and breadth--of\r\na mind easily accessible to strong prejudices, and obstinate in\r\nmaintaining those prejudices in the face of conviction itself.\r\n\r\nTo the observation of women these remote defects were too far below\r\nthe surface to be visible. He charmed the sex in general by his rare\r\npersonal advantages, and by the graceful deference of his manner. To\r\nLady Janet he was endeared, not by his own merits only, but by old\r\nassociations that were connected with him. His father had been one of\r\nher many admirers in her young days. Circumstances had parted them. Her\r\nmarriage to another man had been a childless marriage. In past times,\r\nwhen the boy Horace had come to her from school, she had cherished a\r\nsecret fancy (too absurd to be communicated to any living creature) that\r\nhe ought to have been _her_ son, and might have been her son, if she had\r\nmarried his father! She smiled charmingly, old as she was--she yielded\r\nas his mother might have yielded--when the young man took her hand and\r\nentreated her to interest herself in his marriage. \xe2\x80\x9cMust I really speak\r\nto Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a gentleness of tone and manner far from\r\ncharacteristic, on ordinary occasions, of the lady of Mablethorpe House.\r\nHorace saw that he had gained his point. He sprang to his feet; his eyes\r\nturned eagerly in the direction of the conservatory; his handsome face\r\nwas radiant with hope. Lady Janet (with her mind full of his father)\r\nstole a last look at him, sighed as she thought of the vanished days,\r\nand recovered herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the smoking-room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, giving him a push toward the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with you, and cultivate the favorite vice of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\xe2\x80\x9d Horace attempted to express his gratitude. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nall she said, pushing him out. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft by herself, Lady Janet took a turn in the room, and considered a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s discontent was not unreasonable. There was really no excuse for\r\nthe delay of which he complained. Whether the young lady had a special\r\nmotive for hanging back, or whether she was merely fretting because she\r\ndid not know her own mind, it was, in either case, necessary to come to\r\na distinct understanding, sooner or later, on the serious question of\r\nthe marriage. The difficulty was, how to approach the subject without\r\ngiving offense. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the young women of the present\r\ngeneration,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my time, when we were fond of a\r\nman, we were ready to marry him at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. And this is an age\r\nof progress! They ought to be readier still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArriving, by her own process of induction, at this inevitable\r\nconclusion, she decided to try what her influence could accomplish, and\r\nto trust to the inspiration of the moment for exerting it in the right\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace!\xe2\x80\x9d she called out, approaching the conservatory door.\r\nThe tall, lithe figure in its gray dress glided into view, and stood\r\nrelieved against the green background of the winter-garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your ladyship call me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I want to speak to you. Come and sit down by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words Lady Janet led the way to a sofa, and placed her\r\ncompanion by her side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE MAN IS COMING.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very pale this morning, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy sighed wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not well,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe slightest\r\nnoises startle me. I feel tired if I only walk across the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet patted her kindly on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must try what a change\r\nwill do for you. Which shall it be? the Continent or the sea-side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship is too kind to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to be too kind to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy started. The color flowed charmingly over her pale face. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed, impulsively. \xe2\x80\x9cSay that again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it again?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Lady Janet, with a look of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Don\xe2\x80\x99t think me presuming; only think me vain. I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you say\r\ntoo often that you have learned to like me. Is it really a pleasure to\r\nyou to have me in the house? Have I always behaved well since I have\r\nbeen with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(The one excuse for the act of personation--if excuse there could\r\nbe--lay in the affirmative answer to those questions. It would be\r\nsomething, surely, to say of the false Grace that the true Grace could\r\nnot have been worthier of her welcome, if the true Grace had been\r\nreceived at Mablethorpe House!)\r\n\r\nLady Janet was partly touched, partly amused, by the extraordinary\r\nearnestness of the appeal that had been made to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you behaved well?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you talk as if you were\r\na child!\xe2\x80\x9d She laid her hand caressingly on Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and continued,\r\nin a graver tone: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hardly too much to say, Grace, that I bless the\r\nday when you first came to me. I do believe I could be hardly fonder of\r\nyou if you were my own daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy suddenly turned her head aside, so as to hide her face. Lady\r\nJanet, still touching her arm, felt it tremble. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in her abrupt, downright manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only very grateful to your ladyship--that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d The words were\r\nspoken faintly, in broken tones. The face was still averted from Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s view. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I said to provoke this?\xe2\x80\x9d wondered the old lady.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she in the melting mood to-day? If she is, now is the time to say\r\na word for Horace!\xe2\x80\x9d Keeping that excellent object in view, Lady Janet\r\napproached the delicate topic with all needful caution at starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have got on so well together,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it will not be\r\neasy for either of us to feel reconciled to a change in our lives. At\r\nmy age, it will fall hardest on me. What shall I do, Grace, when the day\r\ncomes for parting with my adopted daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy started, and showed her face again. The traces of tears were in\r\nher eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in a tone of alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you know!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Tell me why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Horace to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last allusion was too plain to be misunderstood. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\ndrooped. She began to tremble again. Lady Janet looked at her in blank\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything wrong between Horace and you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know your own heart, my dear child? You have surely not encouraged\r\nHorace without loving him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time in their experience of each other Mercy ventured to\r\ninterrupt her benefactress. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed, gently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in no hurry to be married. There will be plenty of time in the\r\nfuture to talk of that. You had something you wished to say to me. What\r\nis it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to disconcert Lady Janet Roy. But that last\r\nquestion fairly reduced her to silence. After all that had passed,\r\nthere sat her young companion, innocent of the faintest suspicion of the\r\nsubject that was to be discussed between them! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are the young women\r\nof the present time made of?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old lady, utterly at a loss to\r\nknow what to say next. Mercy waited, on her side, with an impenetrable\r\npatience which only aggravated the difficulties of the position. The\r\nsilence was fast threatening to bring the interview to a sudden and\r\nuntimely end, when the door from the library opened, and a man-servant,\r\nbearing a little silver salver, entered the room.\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s rising sense of annoyance instantly seized on the servant\r\nas a victim. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI never rang for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter, my lady. The messenger waits for an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man presented his salver with the letter on it, and withdrew.\r\n\r\nLady Janet recognized the handwriting on the address with a look\r\nof surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pausing, with her\r\nold-fashioned courtesy, before she opened the envelope. Mercy made the\r\nnecessary acknowledgment, and moved away to the other end of the room,\r\nlittle thinking that the arrival of the letter marked a crisis in her\r\nlife. Lady Janet put on her spectacles. \xe2\x80\x9cOdd that he should have come\r\nback already!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, as she threw the empty envelope on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nThe letter contained these lines, the writer of them being no other than\r\nthe man who had preached in the chapel of the Refuge:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR AUNT--I am back again in London before my time. My friend the\r\nrector has shortened his holiday, and has resumed his duties in the\r\ncountry. I am afraid you will blame me when you hear of the reasons\r\nwhich have hastened his return. The sooner I make my confession, the\r\neasier I shall feel. Besides, I have a special object in wishing to see\r\nyou as soon as possible. May I follow my letter to Mablethorpe House?\r\nAnd may I present a lady to you--a perfect stranger--in whom I am\r\ninterested? Pray say Yes, by the bearer, and oblige your affectionate\r\nnephew,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJULIAN GRAY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Janet referred again suspiciously to the sentence in the letter\r\nwhich alluded to the \xe2\x80\x9clady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian Gray was her only surviving nephew, the son of a favorite sister\r\nwhom she had lost. He would have held no very exalted position in the\r\nestimation of his aunt--who regarded his views in politics and religion\r\nwith the strongest aversion--but for his marked resemblance to his\r\nmother. This pleaded for him with the old lady, aided as it was by the\r\npride that she secretly felt in the early celebrity which the young\r\nclergyman had achieved as a writer and a preacher. Thanks to these\r\nmitigating circumstances, and to Julian\xe2\x80\x99s inexhaustible good-humor, the\r\naunt and the nephew generally met on friendly terms. Apart from what\r\nshe called \xe2\x80\x9chis detestable opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet was sufficiently\r\ninterested in Julian to feel some curiosity about the mysterious \xe2\x80\x9clady\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n mentioned in the letter. Had he determined to settle in life? Was his\r\nchoice already made? And if so, would it prove to be a choice acceptable\r\nto the family? Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s bright face showed signs of doubt as she\r\nasked herself that last question. Julian\xe2\x80\x99s liberal views were capable of\r\nleading him to dangerous extremes. His aunt shook her head ominously as\r\nshe rose from the sofa and advanced to the library door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pausing and turning round, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a note to write to\r\nmy nephew. I shall be back directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy approached her, from the opposite extremity of the room, with an\r\nexclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour nephew?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship never told me you had a\r\nnephew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI must have had it on the tip of my tongue to tell\r\nyou, over and over again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we have had so many things to\r\ntalk about--and, to own the truth, my nephew is not one of my favorite\r\nsubjects of conversation. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I dislike him; I detest\r\nhis principles, my dear, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. However, you shall form your own\r\nopinion of him; he is coming to see me to-day. Wait here till I return;\r\nI have something more to say about Horace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy opened the library door for her, closed it again, and walked\r\nslowly to and fro alone in the room, thinking.\r\n\r\nWas her mind running on Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s nephew? No. Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s brief\r\nallusion to her relative had not led her into alluding to him by his\r\nname. Mercy was still as ignorant as ever that the preacher at the\r\nRefuge and the nephew of her benefactress were one and the same man. Her\r\nmemory was busy now with the tribute which Lady Janet had paid to her at\r\nthe outset of the interview between them: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hardly too much to say,\r\nGrace, that I bless the day when you first came to me.\xe2\x80\x9d For the moment\r\nthere was balm for her wounded spirit in the remembrance of those words.\r\nGrace Roseberry herself could surely have earned no sweeter praise than\r\nthe praise that she had won. The next instant she was seized with a\r\nsudden horror of her own successful fraud. The sense of her degradation\r\nhad never been so bitterly present to her as at that moment. If she\r\ncould only confess the truth--if she could innocently enjoy her harmless\r\nlife at Mablethorpe House--what a grateful, happy woman she might be!\r\nWas it possible (if she made the confession) to trust to her own good\r\nconduct to plead her excuse? No! Her calmer sense warned her that it\r\nwas hopeless. The place she had won--honestly won--in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestimation had been obtained by a trick. Nothing could alter, nothing\r\ncould excuse, _that_. She took out her handkerchief and dashed away\r\nthe useless tears that had gathered in her eyes, and tried to turn her\r\nthoughts some other way. What was it Lady Janet had said on going into\r\nthe library? She had said she was coming back to speak about Horace.\r\nMercy guessed what the object was; she knew but too well what Horace\r\nwanted of her. How was she to meet the emergency? In the name of Heaven,\r\nwhat was to be done? Could she let the man who loved her--the man whom\r\nshe loved--drift blindfold into marriage with such a woman as she had\r\nbeen? No! it was her duty to warn him. How? Could she break his heart,\r\ncould she lay his life waste by speaking the cruel words which might\r\npart them forever? \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell him! I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell him!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst\r\nout, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cThe disgrace of it would kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d Her varying mood\r\nchanged as the words escaped her. A reckless defiance of her own better\r\nnature--that saddest of all the forms in which a woman\xe2\x80\x99s misery can\r\nexpress itself--filled her heart with its poisoning bitterness. She sat\r\ndown again on the sofa with eyes that glittered and cheeks suffused with\r\nan angry red. \xe2\x80\x9cI am no worse than another woman!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother\r\nwoman might have married him for his money.\xe2\x80\x9d The next moment the\r\nmiserable insufficiency of her own excuse for deceiving him showed its\r\nhollowness, self-exposed. She covered her face with her hands, and\r\nfound refuge--where she had often found refuge before--in the helpless\r\nresignation of despair. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that I had died before I entered this\r\nhouse! Oh, that I could die and have done with it at this moment!\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nthe struggle had ended with her hundreds of times already. So it ended\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe door leading into the billiard-room opened softly. Horace Holmcroft\r\nhad waited to hear the result of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s interference in his favor\r\nuntil he could wait no longer.\r\n\r\nHe looked in cautiously, ready to withdraw again unnoticed if the two\r\nwere still talking together. The absence of Lady Janet suggested that\r\nthe interview had come to an end. Was his betrothed wife waiting alone\r\nto speak to him on his return to the room? He advanced a few steps.\r\nShe never moved; she sat heedless, absorbed in her thoughts. Were they\r\nthoughts of _him?_ He advanced a little nearer, and called to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet, with a faint cry. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t startle\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, irritably, sinking back on the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cAny sudden alarm\r\nsets my heart beating as if it would choke me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace pleaded for pardon with a lover\xe2\x80\x99s humility. In her present state\r\nof nervous irritation she was not to be appeased. She looked away from\r\nhim in silence. Entirely ignorant of the paroxysm of mental suffering\r\nthrough which she had just passed, he seated himself by her side, and\r\nasked her gently if she had seen Lady Janet. She made an affirmative\r\nanswer with an unreasonable impatience of tone and manner which would\r\nhave warned an older and more experienced man to give her time before\r\nhe spoke again. Horace was young, and weary of the suspense that he\r\nhad endured in the other room. He unwisely pressed her with another\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Lady Janet said anything to you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned on him angrily before he could finish the sentence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\ntried to make her hurry me into marrying you,\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cI see it\r\nin your face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlain as the warning was this time, Horace still failed to interpret it\r\nin the right way. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, good-humoredly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it so\r\nvery inexcusable to ask Lady Janet to intercede for me? I have tried to\r\npersuade you in vain. My mother and my sisters have pleaded for me, and\r\nyou turn a deaf ear--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could endure it no longer. She stamped her foot on the door with\r\nhysterical vehemence. \xe2\x80\x9cI am weary of hearing of your mother and your\r\nsisters!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke in violently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk of nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was just possible to make one more mistake in dealing with her--and\r\nHorace made it. He took offense, on his side, and rose from the sofa.\r\nHis mother and sisters were high authorities in his estimation; they\r\nvariously represented his ideal of perfection in women. He withdrew\r\nto the opposite extremity of the room, and administered the severest\r\nreproof that he could think of on the spur of the moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be well, Grace, if you followed the example set you by\r\nmy mother and my sisters,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c_They_ are not in the habit of\r\nspeaking cruelly to those who love them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo all appearance the rebuke failed to produce the slightest effect.\r\nShe seemed to be as indifferent to it as if it had not reached her ears.\r\nThere was a spirit in her--a miserable spirit, born of her own bitter\r\nexperience--which rose in revolt against Horace\xe2\x80\x99s habitual glorification\r\nof the ladies of his family. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sickens me,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto hear of the virtues of women who have never been tempted! Where\r\nis the merit of living reputably, when your life is one course of\r\nprosperity and enjoyment? Has his mother known starvation? Have his\r\nsisters been left forsaken in the street?\xe2\x80\x9d It hardened her heart--it\r\nalmost reconciled her to deceiving him--when he set his relatives up as\r\npatterns for her. Would he never understand that women detested having\r\nother women exhibited as examples to them? She looked round at him with\r\na sense of impatient wonder. He was sitting at the luncheon-table, with\r\nhis back turned on her, and his head resting on his hand. If he had\r\nattempted to rejoin her, she would have repelled him; if he had spoken,\r\nshe would have met him with a sharp reply. He sat apart from her,\r\nwithout uttering a word. In a man\xe2\x80\x99s hands silence is the most terrible\r\nof all protests to the woman who loves him. Violence she can endure.\r\nWords she is always ready to meet by words on her side. Silence conquers\r\nher. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, Mercy left the sofa and advanced\r\nsubmissively toward the table. She had offended him--and she alone\r\nwas in fault. How should he know it, poor fellow, when he innocently\r\nmortified her? Step by step she drew closer and closer. He never looked\r\nround; he never moved. She laid her hand timidly on his shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Horace,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered in his ear. \xe2\x80\x9cI am suffering this\r\nmorning; I am not myself. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean what I said. Pray forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n There was no resisting the caressing tenderness of voice and manner\r\nwhich accompanied those words. He looked up; he took her hand. She bent\r\nover him, and touched his forehead with her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I forgiven?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you only knew how I loved you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do know it,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, gently, twining his hair round her finger,\r\nand arranging it over his forehead where his hand had ruffled it.\r\n\r\nThey were completely absorbed in each other, or they must, at that\r\nmoment, have heard the library door open at the other end of the room.\r\n\r\nLady Janet had written the necessary reply to her nephew, and had\r\nreturned, faithful to her engagement, to plead the cause of Horace. The\r\nfirst object that met her view was her client pleading, with conspicuous\r\nsuccess, for himself! \xe2\x80\x9cI am not wanted, evidently,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old\r\nlady. She noiselessly closed the door again and left the lovers by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHorace returned, with unwise persistency, to the question of the\r\ndeferred marriage. At the first words that he spoke she drew back\r\ndirectly--sadly, not angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t press me to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not well to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose and looked at her anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I speak about it to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d She returned to the sofa, and changed the subject.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a time Lady Janet is away!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be keeping her so\r\nlong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace did his best to appear interested in the question of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprolonged absence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made her leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, standing at the\r\nback of the sofa and leaning over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went into the library to write a note to her nephew. By-the-by, who\r\nis her nephew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible you don\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of him, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s nephew\r\nis a celebrated man.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and stooping nearer to her, lifted a\r\nlove-lock that lay over her shoulder and pressed it to his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cLady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s nephew,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cis Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started off her seat, and looked round at him in blank, bewildered\r\nterror, as if she doubted the evidence of her own senses.\r\n\r\nHorace was completely taken by surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Grace!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat have I said or done to startle you this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held up her hand for silence. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s nephew is Julian Gray,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she repeated; \xe2\x80\x9cand I only know it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s perplexity increased. \xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, now you do know it, what is\r\nthere to alarm you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n(There was enough to alarm the boldest woman living--in such a position,\r\nand with such a temperament as hers. To her mind the personation of\r\nGrace Roseberry had suddenly assumed a new aspect: the aspect of a\r\nfatality. It had led her blindfold to the house in which she and the\r\npreacher at the Refuge were to meet. He was coming--the man who had\r\nreached her inmost heart, who had influenced her whole life! Was the day\r\nof reckoning coming with him?)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t notice me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been ill all the morning.\r\nYou saw it yourself when you came in here; even the sound of your voice\r\nalarmed me. I shall be better directly. I am afraid I startled you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Grace, it almost looked as if you were terrified at the sound\r\nof Julian\xe2\x80\x99s name! He is a public celebrity, I know; and I have seen\r\nladies start and stare at him when he entered a room. But _you_ looked\r\nperfectly panic-stricken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rallied her courage by a desperate effort; she laughed--a harsh,\r\nuneasy laugh--and stopped him by putting her hand over his mouth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsurd!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if Mr. Julian Gray had anything to do\r\nwith my looks! I am better already. See for yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked round\r\nat him again with a ghastly gayety; and returned, with a desperate\r\nassumption of indifference, to the subject of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s nephew. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse I have heard of him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that he is expected\r\nhere to-day? Don\xe2\x80\x99t stand there behind me--it\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to talk to you.\r\nCome and sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe obeyed--but she had not quite satisfied him yet. His face had not\r\nlost its expression of anxiety and surprise. She persisted in playing\r\nher part, determined to set at rest in him any possible suspicion that\r\nshe had reasons of her own for being afraid of Julian Gray. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\r\nabout this famous man of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, putting her arm familiarly\r\nthrough his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe caressing action and the easy tone had their effect on Horace. His\r\nface began to clear; he answered her lightly on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrepare yourself to meet the most unclerical of clergymen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulian is a lost sheep among the parsons, and a thorn in the side of\r\nhis bishop. Preaches, if they ask him, in Dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 chapels. Declines\r\nto set up any pretensions to priestly authority and priestly power. Goes\r\nabout doing good on a plan of his own. Is quite resigned never to rise\r\nto the high places in his profession. Says it\xe2\x80\x99s rising high enough for\r\n_him_ to be the Archdeacon of the afflicted, the Dean of the hungry, and\r\nthe Bishop of the poor. With all his oddities, as good a fellow as ever\r\nlived. Immensely popular with the women. They all go to him for advice.\r\nI wish you would go, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy changed color. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulian is famous for his powers of persuasion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Horace, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _he_ spoke to you, Grace, he would prevail on you to fix the day.\r\nSuppose I ask Julian to plead for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made the proposal in jest. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s unquiet mind accepted it as\r\naddressed to her in earnest. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, with a sense\r\nof indescribable terror, \xe2\x80\x9cif I don\xe2\x80\x99t stop him!\xe2\x80\x9d There is but one chance\r\nfor her. The only certain way to prevent Horace from appealing to his\r\nfriend was to grant what Horace wished for before his friend entered the\r\nhouse. She laid her hand on his shoulder; she hid the terrible anxieties\r\nthat were devouring her under an assumption of coquetry painful and\r\npitiable to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gayly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat were we saying just\r\nnow--before we began to speak of Mr. Julian Gray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were wondering what had become of Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace replied.\r\n\r\nShe tapped him impatiently on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! no! It was something\r\nyou said before that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes completed what her words had left unsaid. Horace\xe2\x80\x99s arm stole\r\nround her waist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was saying that I loved you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you tired of hearing it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled charmingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you so very much in earnest about--about--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She stopped, and looked away from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout our marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the one dearest wish of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s fingers toyed nervously with the trinkets at\r\nher watch-chain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen would you like it to be?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, very softly,\r\nwith her whole attention fixed on the watch-chain.\r\n\r\nShe had never spoken, she had never looked, as she spoke and looked now.\r\nHorace was afraid to believe in his own good fortune. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Grace!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not trifling with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think I am trifling with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace was innocent enough to answer her seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would not even\r\nlet me speak of our marriage just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what I did just now,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, petulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say\r\nwomen are changeable. It is one of the defects of the sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven be praised for the defects of the sex!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Horace, with\r\ndevout sincerity. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really leave me to decide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you insist on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace considered for a moment--the subject being the law of marriage.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may be married by license in a fortnight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI fix this day\r\nfortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held up her hands in protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? My lawyer is ready. There are no preparations to make. You\r\nsaid when you accepted me that it was to be a private marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy was obliged to own that she had certainly said that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might be married at once--if the law would only let us. This day\r\nfortnight! Say--Yes!\xe2\x80\x9d He drew her closer to him. There was a pause. The\r\nmask of coquetry--badly worn from the first--dropped from her. Her\r\nsad gray eyes rested compassionately on his eager face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look so\r\nserious!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly one little word, Grace! Only Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed, and said it. He kissed her passionately. It was only by a\r\nresolute effort that she released herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cPray leave me by myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was in earnest--strangely in earnest. She was trembling from head\r\nto foot. Horace rose to leave her. \xe2\x80\x9cI will find Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlong to show the dear old lady that I have recovered my spirits, and to\r\ntell her why.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned round at the library door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t go away?\r\nYou will let me see you again when you are more composed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with that reply, he left the room.\r\n\r\nHer hands dropped on her lap; her head sank back wearily on the cushions\r\nat the head of the sofa. There was a dazed sensation in her: her mind\r\nfelt stunned. She wondered vacantly whether she was awake or dreaming.\r\nHad she really said the word which pledged her to marry Horace Holmcroft\r\nin a fortnight? A fortnight! Something might happen in that time to\r\nprevent it: she might find her way in a fortnight out of the terrible\r\nposition in which she stood. Anyway, come what might of it, she had\r\nchosen the preferable alternative to a private interview with Julian\r\nGray. She raised herself from her recumbent position with a start, as\r\nthe idea of the interview--dismissed for the last few minutes--possessed\r\nitself again of her mind. Her excited imagination figured Julian Gray\r\nas present in the room at that moment, speaking to her as Horace had\r\nproposed. She saw him seated close at her side--this man who had shaken\r\nher to the soul when he was in the pulpit, and when she was listening to\r\nhim (unseen) at the other end of the chapel--she saw him close by her,\r\nlooking her searchingly in the face; seeing her shameful secret in\r\nher eyes; hearing it in her voice; feeling it in her trembling hands;\r\nforcing it out of her word by word, till she fell prostrate at his\r\nfeet with the confession of the fraud. Her head dropped again on the\r\ncushions; she hid her face in horror of the scene which her excited\r\nfancy had conjured up. Even now, when she had made that dreaded\r\ninterview needless, could she feel sure (meeting him only on the most\r\ndistant terms) of not betraying herself? She could _not_ feel sure.\r\nSomething in her shuddered and shrank at the bare idea of finding\r\nherself in the same room with him. She felt it, she knew it: her guilty\r\nconscience owned and feared its master in Julian Gray!\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed. The violence of her agitation began to tell\r\nphysically on her weakened frame.\r\n\r\nShe found herself crying silently without knowing why. A weight was\r\non her head, a weariness was in all her limbs. She sank lower on the\r\ncushions--her eyes closed--the monotonous ticking of the clock on the\r\nmantelpiece grew drowsily fainter and fainter on her ear. Little by\r\nlittle she dropped into slumber--slumber so light that she started when\r\na morsel of coal fell into the grate, or when the birds chirped and\r\ntwittered in their aviary in the winter-garden.\r\n\r\nLady Janet and Horace came in. She was faintly conscious of persons in\r\nthe room. After an interval she opened her eyes, and half rose to speak\r\nto them. The room was empty again. They had stolen out softly and left\r\nher to repose. Her eyes closed once more. She dropped back into slumber,\r\nand from slumber, in the favoring warmth and quiet of the place, into\r\ndeep and dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE MAN APPEARS.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of rest Mercy was aroused by the shutting of a glass\r\ndoor at the far end of the conservatory. This door, leading into the\r\ngarden, was used only by the inmates of the house, or by old friends\r\nprivileged to enter the reception-rooms by that way. Assuming that\r\neither Horace or Lady Janet was returning to the dining-room, Mercy\r\nraised herself a little on the\xe2\x80\x99 sofa and listened.\r\n\r\nThe voice of one of the men-servants caught her ear. It was answered by\r\nanother voice, which instantly set her trembling in every limb.\r\n\r\nShe started up, and listened again in speechless terror. Yes! there\r\nwas no mistaking it. The voice that was answering the servant was the\r\nunforgotten voice which she had heard at the Refuge. The visitor who had\r\ncome in by the glass door was--Julian Gray!\r\n\r\nHis rapid footsteps advanced nearer and nearer to the dining-room. She\r\nrecovered herself sufficiently to hurry to the library door. Her hand\r\nshook so that she failed at first to open it. She had just succeeded\r\nwhen she heard him again--speaking to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t run away! I am nothing very formidable. Only Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnephew--Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned slowly, spell-bound by his voice, and confronted him in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nHe was standing, hat in hand, at the entrance to the conservatory,\r\ndressed in black, and wearing a white cravat, but with a studious\r\navoidance of anything specially clerical in the make and form of his\r\nclothes. Young as he was, there were marks of care already on his face,\r\nand the hair was prematurely thin and scanty over his forehead. His\r\nslight, active figure was of no more than the middle height. His\r\ncomplexion was pale. The lower part of his face, without beard or\r\nwhiskers, was in no way remarkable. An average observer would have\r\npassed him by without notice but for his eyes. These alone made a marked\r\nman of him. The unusual size of the orbits in which they were set was\r\nenough of itself to attract attention; it gave a grandeur to his head,\r\nwhich the head, broad and firm as it was, did not possess. As to the\r\neyes themselves, the soft, lustrous brightness of them defied analysis\r\nNo two people could agree about their color; divided opinion declaring\r\nalternately that they were dark gray or black. Painters had tried to\r\nreproduce them, and had given up the effort, in despair of seizing any\r\none expression in the bewildering variety of expressions which they\r\npresented to view. They were eyes that could charm at one moment and\r\nterrify at another; eyes that could set people laughing or crying almost\r\nat will. In action and in repose they were irresistible alike. When they\r\nfirst descried Mercy running to the door, they brightened gayly with\r\nthe merriment of a child. When she turned and faced him, they changed\r\ninstantly, softening and glowing as they mutely owned the interest and\r\nthe admiration which the first sight of her had roused in him. His tone\r\nand manner altered at the same time. He addressed her with the deepest\r\nrespect when he spoke his next words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me entreat you to favor me by resuming your seat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nlet me ask your pardon if I have thoughtlessly intruded on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, waiting for her reply before he advanced into the room. Still\r\nspell-bound by his voice, she recovered self-control enough to bow to\r\nhim and to resume her place on the sofa. It was impossible to leave\r\nhim now. After looking at her for a moment, he entered the room without\r\nspeaking to her again. She was beginning to perplex as well as to\r\ninterest him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo common sorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9chas set its mark on that\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s face; no common heart beats in that woman\xe2\x80\x99s breast. Who can she\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy rallied her courage, and forced herself to speak to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet is in the library, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I\r\ntell her you are here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t disturb Lady Janet, and don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d With that answer\r\nhe approached the luncheon-table, delicately giving her time to feel\r\nmore at her ease. He took up what Horace had left of the bottle of\r\nclaret, and poured it into a glass. \xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt\xe2\x80\x99s claret shall represent\r\nmy aunt for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling, as he turned toward her once\r\nmore. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a long walk, and I may venture to help myself in this\r\nhouse without invitation. Is it useless to offer you anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy made the necessary reply. She was beginning already, after her\r\nremarkable experience of him, to wonder at his easy manners and his\r\nlight way of talking.\r\n\r\nHe emptied his glass with the air of a man who thoroughly understood\r\nand enjoyed good wine. \xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt\xe2\x80\x99s claret is worthy of my aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nwith comic gravity, as he set down the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth are the genuine\r\nproducts of Nature.\xe2\x80\x9d He seated himself at the table and looked\r\ncritically at the different dishes left on it. One dish especially\r\nattracted his attention. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cA French pie! It\r\nseems grossly unfair to taste French wine and to pass over French pie\r\nwithout notice.\xe2\x80\x9d He took up a knife and fork, and enjoyed the pie as\r\ncritically as he had enjoyed the wine. \xe2\x80\x9cWorthy of the Great Nation!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, with enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9c_Vive la France!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy listened and looked, in inexpressible astonishment. He was utterly\r\nunlike the picture which her fancy had drawn of him in everyday life.\r\nTake off his white cravat, and nobody would have discovered that this\r\nfamous preacher was a clergyman!\r\n\r\nHe helped himself to another plateful of the pie, and spoke more\r\ndirectly to Mercy, alternately eating and talking as composedly and\r\npleasantly as if they had known each other for years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came here by way of Kensington Gardens,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor some time past\r\nI have been living in a flat, ugly, barren, agricultural district. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think how pleasant I found the picture presented by the Gardens,\r\nas a contrast. The ladies in their rich winter dresses, the smart\r\nnursery maids, the lovely children, the ever moving crowd skating on the\r\nice of the Round Pond; it was all so exhilarating after what I have been\r\nused to, that I actually caught myself whistling as I walked through the\r\nbrilliant scene! (In my time boys used always to whistle when they were\r\nin good spirits, and I have not got over the habit yet.) Who do you\r\nthink I met when I was in full song?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs well as her amazement would let her, Mercy excused herself from\r\nguessing. She had never in all her life before spoken to any living\r\nbeing so confusedly and so unintelligently as she now spoke to Julian\r\nGray!\r\n\r\nHe went on more gayly than ever, without appearing to notice the effect\r\nthat he had produced on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom did I meet,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was in full song? My bishop! If\r\nI had been whistling a sacred melody, his lordship might perhaps have\r\nexcused my vulgarity out of consideration for my music. Unfortunately,\r\nthe composition I was executing at the moment (I am one of the loudest\r\nof living whistlers) was by Verdi--\xe2\x80\x9cLa Donna e Mobile\xe2\x80\x9d--familiar, no\r\ndoubt, to his lordship on the street organs. He recognized the tune,\r\npoor man, and when I took off my hat to him he looked the other way.\r\nStrange, in a world that is bursting with sin and sorrow, to treat such\r\na trifle seriously as a cheerful clergyman whistling a tune!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npushed away his plate as he said the last words, and went on simply and\r\nearnestly in an altered tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never been able,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nsee why we should assert ourselves among other men as belonging to a\r\nparticular caste, and as being forbidden, in any harmless thing, to do\r\nas other people do. The disciples of old set us no such example; they\r\nwere wiser and better than we are. I venture to say that one of the\r\nworst obstacles in the way of our doing good among our fellow-creatures\r\nis raised by the mere assumption of the clerical manner and the clerical\r\nvoice. For my part, I set up no claim to be more sacred and more\r\nreverend than any other Christian man who does what good he can.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nglanced brightly at Mercy, looking at him in helpless perplexity. The\r\nspirit of fun took possession of him again. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a Radical?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, with a humorous twinkle in his large lustrous eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy tried hard to understand him, and tried in vain. Could this be the\r\npreacher whose words had charmed, purified, ennobled her? Was this the\r\nman whose sermon had drawn tears from women about her whom she knew to\r\nbe shameless and hardened in crime? Yes! The eyes that now rested on her\r\nhumorously were the beautiful eyes which had once looked into her soul.\r\nThe voice that had just addressed a jesting question to her was the deep\r\nand mellow voice which had once thrilled her to the heart. In the pulpit\r\nhe was an angel of mercy; out of the pulpit he was a boy let loose from\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me startle you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, good-naturedly, noticing her\r\nconfusion. \xe2\x80\x9cPublic opinion has called me by harder names than the name\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98Radical.\xe2\x80\x99 I have been spending my time lately--as I told you just\r\nnow--in an agricultural district. My business there was to perform the\r\nduty for the rector of the place, who wanted a holiday. How do you think\r\nthe experiment has ended? The Squire of the parish calls me a Communist;\r\nthe farmers denounce me as an Incendiary; my friend the rector has been\r\nrecalled in a hurry, and I have now the honor of speaking to you in the\r\ncharacter of a banished man who has made a respectable neighborhood too\r\nhot to hold him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that frank avowal he left the luncheon table, and took a chair near\r\nMercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will naturally be anxious,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto know what my offense\r\nwas. Do you understand Political Economy and the Laws of Supply and\r\nDemand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy owned that she did _not_ understand them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more do I--in a Christian country,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was my offense.\r\nYou shall hear my confession (just as my aunt will hear it) in two\r\nwords.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused for a little while; his variable manner changed\r\nagain. Mercy, shyly looking at him, saw a new expression in his eyes--an\r\nexpression which recalled her first remembrance of him as nothing had\r\nrecalled it yet. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cof what the life of a\r\nfarm-laborer really was, in some parts of England, until I undertook the\r\nrector\xe2\x80\x99s duties. Never before had I seen such dire wretchedness as I saw\r\nin the cottages. Never before had I met with such noble patience under\r\nsuffering as I found among the people. The martyrs of old could endure,\r\nand die. I asked myself if they could endure, and _live_, like the\r\nmartyrs whom I saw round me?--live, week after week, month after month,\r\nyear after year, on the brink of starvation; live, and see their pining\r\nchildren growing up round them, to work and want in their turn; live,\r\nwith the poor man\xe2\x80\x99s parish prison to look to as the end, when hunger and\r\nlabor have done their worst! Was God\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful earth made to hold such\r\nmisery as this? I can hardly think of it, I can hardly speak of it, even\r\nnow, with dry eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis head sank on his breast. He waited--mastering his emotion before he\r\nspoke again. Now, at last, she knew him once more. Now he was the man,\r\nindeed, whom she had expected to see. Unconsciously she sat listening,\r\nwith her eyes fixed on his face, with his heart hanging on his words,\r\nin the very attitude of the by-gone day when she had heard him for the\r\nfirst time!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did all I could to plead for the helpless ones,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI went\r\nround among the holders of the land to say a word for the tillers of the\r\nland. \xe2\x80\x98These patient people don\xe2\x80\x99t want much\xe2\x80\x99 (I said); \xe2\x80\x98in the name of\r\nChrist, give them enough to live on!\xe2\x80\x99 Political Economy shrieked at the\r\nhorrid proposal; the Laws of Supply and Demand veiled their majestic\r\nfaces in dismay. Starvation wages were the right wages, I was told. And\r\nwhy? Because the laborer was obliged to accept them! I determined, so\r\nfar as one man could do it, that the laborer should _not_ be obliged to\r\naccept them. I collected my own resources--I wrote to my friends--and\r\nI removed some of the poor fellows to parts of England where their work\r\nwas better paid. Such was the conduct which made the neighborhood too\r\nhot to hold me. So let it be! I mean to go on. I am known in London; I\r\ncan raise subscriptions. The vile Laws of Supply and Demand shall find\r\nlabor scarce in that agricultural district; and pitiless Political\r\nEconomy shall spend a few extra shillings on the poor, as certainly as I\r\nam that Radical, Communist, and Incendiary--Julian Gray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose--making a little gesture of apology for the warmth with which\r\nhe had spoken--and took a turn in the room. Fired by _his_ enthusiasm,\r\nMercy followed him. Her purse was in her hand, when he turned and faced\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray let me offer my little tribute--such as it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, eagerly.\r\n\r\nA momentary flush spread over his pale cheeks as he looked at the\r\nbeautiful compassionate face pleading with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cthough I am a parson, I don\xe2\x80\x99t carry the\r\nbegging-box everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy attempted to press the purse on him. The\r\nquaint humor began to twinkle again in his eyes as he abruptly drew back\r\nfrom it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tempt me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe frailest of all human creatures\r\nis a clergyman tempted by a subscription.\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy persisted, and\r\nconquered; she made him prove the truth of his own profound observation\r\nof clerical human nature by taking a piece of money from the purse. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nI must take it--I must!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for setting the good\r\nexample! thank you for giving the timely help! What name shall I put\r\ndown on my list?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes looked confusedly away from him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo name,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a\r\nlow voice. \xe2\x80\x9cMy subscription is anonymous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she replied, the library door opened. To her infinite relief--to\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s secret disappointment--Lady Janet Roy and Horace Holmcroft\r\nentered the room together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulian!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Janet, holding up her hands in astonishment.\r\n\r\nHe kissed his aunt on the cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship is looking charmingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He gave his hand to Horace. Horace took it, and passed on to Mercy. They\r\nwalked away together slowly to the other end of the room. Julian seized\r\non the chance which left him free to speak privately to his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came in through the conservatory,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I found that young\r\nlady in the room. Who is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very much interested in her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lady Janet, in her gravely\r\nironical way.\r\n\r\nJulian answered in one expressive word. \xe2\x80\x9cIndescribably!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet called to Mercy to join her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9clet me formally present my nephew to you. Julian,\r\nthis is Miss Grace Roseberry--\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly checked herself. The\r\ninstant she pronounced the name, Julian started as if it was a surprise\r\nto him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, bowing to Mercy, with a marked absence of his\r\nformer ease of manner. She returned the courtesy a little restrainedly\r\non her side. She, too, had seen him start when Lady Janet mentioned the\r\nname by which she was known. The start meant something. What could it\r\nbe? Why did he turn aside, after bowing to her, and address himself to\r\nHorace, with an absent look in his face, as if his thoughts were far\r\naway from his words? A complete change had come over him; and it dated\r\nfrom the moment when his aunt had pronounced the name that was not _her_\r\nname---the name that she had stolen!\r\n\r\nLady Janet claimed Julian\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and left Horace free to return to\r\nMercy. \xe2\x80\x9cYour room is ready for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will stay here, of\r\ncourse?\xe2\x80\x9d Julian accepted the invitation---still with the air of a man\r\nwhose mind was preoccupied. Instead of looking at his aunt when he made\r\nhis reply, he looked round at Mercy with a troubled curiosity in his\r\nface, very strange to see. Lady Janet tapped him impatiently on the\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect people to look at me when people speak to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you staring at my adopted daughter for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour adopted daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d Julian repeated--looking at his aunt this time,\r\nand looking very earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! As Colonel Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, she is connected with me by\r\nmarriage already. Did you think I had picked up a foundling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s face cleared; he looked relieved. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten the\r\nColonel,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course the young lady is related to us, as\r\nyou say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharmed, I am sure, to have satisfied you that Grace is not an\r\nimpostor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet, with satirical humility. She took Julian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm and drew him out of hearing of Horace and Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout that letter\r\nof yours?\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is one line in it that rouses my\r\ncuriosity. Who is the mysterious \xe2\x80\x98lady\xe2\x80\x99 whom you wish to present to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian started, and changed color.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s unutterable astonishment, instead of replying, Julian\r\nlooked round at her adopted daughter once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has _she_ got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old lady, out of all\r\npatience with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible for me to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile Miss\r\nRoseberry is in the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. NEWS FROM MANNHEIM.\r\n\r\nLADY JANET\xe2\x80\x99S curiosity was by this time thoroughly aroused. Summoned to\r\nexplain who the nameless lady mentioned in his letter could possibly be,\r\nJulian had looked at her adopted daughter. Asked next to explain what\r\nher adopted daughter had got to do with it, he had declared that he\r\ncould not answer while Miss Roseberry was in the room.\r\n\r\nWhat did he mean? Lady Janet determined to find out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate all mysteries,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as for secrets, I\r\nconsider them to be one of the forms of ill-breeding. People in our rank\r\nof life ought to be above whispering in corners. If you _must_ have your\r\nmystery, I can offer you a corner in the library. Come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian followed his aunt very reluctantly. Whatever the mystery might\r\nbe, he was plainly embarrassed by being called upon to reveal it at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Lady Janet settled herself in her chair, prepared to\r\nquestion and cross-question her nephew, when an obstacle appeared at the\r\nother end of the library, in the shape of a man-servant with a message.\r\nOne of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors had called by appointment to take her to\r\nthe meeting of a certain committee which assembled that day. The servant\r\nannounced that the neighbor--an elderly lady--was then waiting in her\r\ncarriage at the door.\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s ready invention set the obstacle aside without a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s delay. She directed the servant to show her visitor into the\r\ndrawing-room, and to say that she was unexpectedly engaged, but that\r\nMiss Roseberry would see the lady immediately. She then turned to\r\nJulian, and said, with her most satirical emphasis of tone and manner:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be an additional convenience if Miss Roseberry was not only\r\nout of the room before you disclose your secret, but out of the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian gravely answered: \xe2\x80\x9cIt may possibly be quite as well if Miss\r\nRoseberry is out of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet led the way back to the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou looked flushed and feverish when I saw\r\nyou asleep on the sofa a little while since. It will do you no harm to\r\nhave a drive in the fresh air. Our friend has called to take me to the\r\ncommittee meeting. I have sent to tell her that I am engaged--and I\r\nshall be much obliged if you will go in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy looked a little alarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes your ladyship mean the committee\r\nmeeting of the Samaritan Convalescent Home? The members, as I understand\r\nit, are to decide to-day which of the plans for the new building they\r\nare to adopt. I cannot surely presume to vote in your place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can vote, my dear child, just as well as I can,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old\r\nlady. \xe2\x80\x9cArchitecture is one of the lost arts. You know nothing about it;\r\nI know nothing about it; the architects themselves know nothing about\r\nit. One plan is, no doubt, just as bad as the other. Vote, as I should\r\nvote, with the majority. Or as poor dear Dr. Johnson said, \xe2\x80\x98Shout with\r\nthe loudest mob.\xe2\x80\x99 Away with you--and don\xe2\x80\x99t keep the committee waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace hastened to open the door for Mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long shall you be away?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, confidentially. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a\r\nthousand things to say to you, and they have interrupted us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be back in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have the room to ourselves by that time. Come here when you\r\nreturn. You will find me waiting for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy pressed his hand significantly and went out. Lady Janet turned\r\nto Julian, who had thus far remained in the background, still, to all\r\nappearance, as unwilling as ever to enlighten his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is tying your tongue now? Grace is out of the\r\nroom; why won\xe2\x80\x99t you begin? Is Horace in the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. I am only a little uneasy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUneasy about what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you have put that charming creature to some inconvenience\r\nin sending her away just at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace looked up suddenly, with a flush on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you say \xe2\x80\x98that charming creature,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou mean Miss Roseberry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cGently, Julian,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace has only been\r\nintroduced to you hitherto in the character of my adopted daughter--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it seems to be high time,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace added, haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should\r\npresent her next in the character of my engaged wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian looked at Horace as if he could hardly credit the evidence of his\r\nown ears. \xe2\x80\x9cYour wife!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with an irrepressible outburst of\r\ndisappointment and surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. My wife,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are to be married in a fortnight.\r\nMay I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with angry humility, \xe2\x80\x9cif you disapprove of the\r\nmarriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet interposed once more. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Horace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cJulian\r\ncongratulates you, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian coldly and absently echoed the words. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! I congratulate\r\nyou, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet returned to the main object of the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we thoroughly understand one another,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9clet us speak of a\r\nlady who has dropped out of the conversation for the last minute or two.\r\nI mean, Julian, the mysterious lady of your letter. We are alone, as you\r\ndesired. Lift the veil, my reverend nephew, which hides her from mortal\r\neyes! Blush, if you like--and can. Is she the future Mrs. Julian Gray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a perfect stranger to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian answered, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA perfect stranger! You wrote me word you were interested in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ interested in her. And, what is more, you are interested in her,\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s fingers drummed impatiently on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I not\r\nwarned you, Julian, that I hate mysteries? Will you, or will you not,\r\nexplain yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore it was possible to answer, Horace rose from his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I\r\nam in the way?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nJulian signed to him to sit down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told Lady Janet that you are not in the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cI now tell you--as Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s future husband--that you,\r\ntoo, have an interest in hearing what I have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace resumed his seat with an air of suspicious surprise. Julian\r\naddressed himself to Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have often heard me speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cof my old friend and\r\nschool-fellow, John Cressingham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The English consul at Mannheim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same. When I returned from the country I found among my other\r\nletters a long letter from the consul. I have brought it with me, and\r\nI propose to read certain passages from it, which tell a very strange\r\nstory more plainly and more credibly than I can tell it in my own\r\nwords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it be very long?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Lady Janet, looking with some alarm at\r\nthe closely written sheets of paper which her nephew spread open before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHorace followed with a question on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure I am interested in it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe consul at Mannheim\r\nis a total stranger to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answer for it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Julian, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cneither my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s patience\r\nnor yours, Horace, will be thrown away if you will favor me by listening\r\nattentively to what I am about to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he began his first extract from the consul\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\n* * * \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My memory is a bad one for dates. But full three months must\r\nhave passed since information was sent to me of an English patient,\r\nreceived at the hospital here, whose case I, as English consul, might\r\nfeel an interest in investigating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I went the same day to the hospital, and was taken to the bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The patient was a woman--young, and (when in health), I should think,\r\nvery pretty. When I first saw her she looked, to my uninstructed eye,\r\nlike a dead woman. I noticed that her head had a bandage over it, and\r\nI asked what was the nature of the injury that she had received. The\r\nanswer informed me that the poor creature had been present, nobody knew\r\nwhy or wherefore, at a skirmish or night attack between the Germans\r\nand the French, and that the injury to her head had been inflicted by a\r\nfragment of a German shell.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace--thus far leaning back carelessly in his chair--suddenly raised\r\nhimself and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! can this be the woman I saw laid\r\nout for dead in the French cottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible for me to say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to the rest of\r\nit. The consul\xe2\x80\x99s letter may answer your question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on with his reading:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The wounded woman had been reported dead, and had been left by\r\nthe French in their retreat, at the time when the German forces took\r\npossession of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s position. She was found on a bed in a cottage\r\nby the director of the German ambulance--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIgnatius Wetzel?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Horace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIgnatius Wetzel,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Julian, looking at the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ the same!\xe2\x80\x9d said Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet, we are really interested\r\nin this. You remember my telling you how I first met with Grace? And you\r\nhave heard more about it since, no doubt, from Grace herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has a horror of referring to that part of her journey home,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cShe mentioned her having been stopped on the\r\nfrontier, and her finding herself accidentally in the company of another\r\nEnglishwoman, a perfect stranger to her. I naturally asked questions on\r\nmy side, and was shocked to hear that she had seen the woman killed by\r\na German shell almost close at her side. Neither she nor I have had any\r\nrelish for returning to the subject since. You were quite right, Julian,\r\nto avoid speaking of it while she was in the room. I understand it all\r\nnow. Grace, I suppose, mentioned my name to her fellow-traveler. The\r\nwoman is, no doubt, in want of assistance, and she applies to me through\r\nyou. I will help her; but she must not come here until I have prepared\r\nGrace for seeing her again, a living woman. For the present there is no\r\nreason why they should meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian, in low tones, without looking\r\nup at his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Is the mystery not at an end yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mystery has not even begun yet. Let my friend the consul proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian returned for the second time to his extract from the letter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98After a careful examination of the supposed corpse, the German surgeon\r\narrived at the conclusion that a case of suspended animation had (in the\r\nhurry of the French retreat) been mistaken for a case of death. Feeling\r\na professional interest in the subject, he decided on putting his\r\nopinion to the test. He operated on the patient with complete success.\r\nAfter performing the operation he kept her for some days under his own\r\ncare, and then transferred her to the nearest hospital--the hospital at\r\nMannheim. He was obliged to return to his duties as army surgeon, and he\r\nleft his patient in the condition in which I saw her, insensible on\r\nthe bed. Neither he nor the hospital authorities knew anything whatever\r\nabout the woman. No papers were found on her. All the doctors could do,\r\nwhen I asked them for information with a view to communicating with\r\nher friends, was to show me her linen marked with her, name. I left the\r\nhospital after taking down the name in my pocket-book. It was \xe2\x80\x9cMercy\r\nMerrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet produced _her_ pocket-book. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me take the name down too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard it before, and I might otherwise forget it. Go\r\non, Julian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian advanced to his second extract from the consul\xe2\x80\x99s letter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Under these circumstances, I could only wait to hear from the hospital\r\nwhen the patient was sufficiently recovered to be able to speak to\r\nme. Some weeks passed without my receiving any communication from the\r\ndoctors. On calling to make inquiries I was informed that fever had\r\nset in, and that the poor creature\xe2\x80\x99s condition now alternated between\r\nexhaustion and delirium. In her delirious moments the name of your aunt,\r\nLady Janet Roy, frequently escaped her. Otherwise her wanderings were\r\nfor the most part quite unintelligible to the people at her bedside. I\r\nthought once or twice of writing to you, and of begging you to speak to\r\nLady Janet. But as the doctors informed me that the chances of life or\r\ndeath were at this time almost equally balanced, I decided to wait until\r\ntime should determine whether it was necessary to trouble you or not.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best, Julian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I own I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see\r\nin what way I am interested in this part of the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what I was going to say,\xe2\x80\x9d added Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very sad, no doubt.\r\nBut what have _we_ to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me read my third extract,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to the third extract, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98At last I received a message from the hospital informing me that Mercy\r\nMerrick was out of danger, and that she was capable (though still very\r\nweak) of answering any questions which I might think it desirable to\r\nput to her. On reaching the hospital, I was requested, rather to my\r\nsurprise, to pay my first visit to the head physician in his private\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it right,\xe2\x80\x9d said this gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cto warn you, before you\r\nsee the patient, to be very careful how you speak to her, and not to\r\nirritate her by showing any surprise or expressing any doubts if she\r\ntalks to you in an extravagant manner. We differ in opinion about her\r\nhere. Some of us (myself among the number) doubt whether the recovery\r\nof her mind has accompanied the recovery of her bodily powers. Without\r\npronouncing her to be mad--she is perfectly gentle and harmless--we are\r\nnevertheless of opinion that she is suffering under a species of insane\r\ndelusion. Bear in mind the caution which I have given you--and now\r\ngo and judge for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d I obeyed, in some little perplexity and\r\nsurprise. The sufferer, when I approached her bed, looked sadly weak and\r\nworn; but, so far as I could judge, seemed to be in full possession of\r\nherself. Her tone and manner were unquestionably the tone and manner of\r\na lady. After briefly introducing myself, I assured her that I should be\r\nglad, both officially and personally, if I could be of any assistance\r\nto her. In saying these trifling words I happened to address her by\r\nthe name I had seen marked on her clothes. The instant the words \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nMerrick\xe2\x80\x9d passed my lips a wild, vindictive expression appeared in her\r\neyes. She exclaimed angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call me by that hateful name!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my name. All the people here persecute me by calling me Mercy\r\nMerrick. And when I am angry with them they show me the clothes. Say\r\nwhat I may, they persist in believing they are my clothes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ndo the same, if you want to be friends with me.\xe2\x80\x9d Remembering what the\r\nphysician had said to me, I made the necessary excuses and succeeded in\r\nsoothing her. Without reverting to the irritating topic of the name,\r\nI merely inquired what her plans were, and assured her that she might\r\ncommand my services if she required them. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to know what\r\nmy plans are?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, suspiciously. I reminded her in reply that\r\nI held the position of English consul, and that my object was, if\r\npossible, to be of some assistance to her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can be of the greatest\r\nassistance to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cFind Mercy Merrick!\xe2\x80\x9d I saw the\r\nvindictive look come back into her eyes, and an angry flush rising on\r\nher white cheeks. Abstaining from showing any surprise, I asked her who\r\nMercy Merrick was. \xe2\x80\x9cA vile woman, by her own confession,\xe2\x80\x9d was the quick\r\nreply. \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to find her?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired next. \xe2\x80\x9cLook for a woman in a\r\nblack dress, with the Red Geneva Cross on her shoulder; she is a nurse\r\nin the French ambulance.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has she done?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI have lost my papers;\r\nI have lost my own clothes; Mercy Merrick has taken them.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\r\nknow that Mercy Merrick has taken them?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNobody else could have taken\r\nthem--that\xe2\x80\x99s how I know it. Do you believe me or not?\xe2\x80\x9d She as beginning\r\nto excite herself again; I assured her that I would at once send to make\r\ninquiries after Mercy Merrick. She turned round contented on the pillow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good man!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome back and tell me when you have\r\ncaught her.\xe2\x80\x9d Such was my first interview with the English patient at the\r\nhospital at Mannheim. It is needless to say that I doubted the existence\r\nof the absent person described as a nurse. However, it was possible\r\nto make inquiries by applying to the surgeon, Ignatius Wetzel, whose\r\nwhereabouts was known to his friends in Mannheim. I wrote to him, and\r\nreceived his answer in due time. After the night attack of the Germans\r\nhad made them masters of the French position, he had entered the cottage\r\noccupied by the French ambulance. He had found the wounded Frenchmen\r\nleft behind, but had seen no such person in attendance on them as the\r\nnurse in the black dress with the red cross on her shoulder. The only\r\nliving woman in the place was a young English lady, in a gray traveling\r\ncloak, who had been stopped on the frontier, and who was forwarded on\r\nher way home by the war correspondent of an English journal.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was the war correspondent,\xe2\x80\x9d added Horace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few words more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will understand my object in\r\nclaiming your attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned to the letter for the last time, and concluded his extracts\r\nfrom it as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Instead of attending at the hospital myself, I communicated by letter\r\nthe failure of my attempt to discover the missing nurse. For some little\r\ntime afterward I heard no more of the sick woman, whom I shall still\r\ncall Mercy Merrick. It was only yesterday that I received another\r\nsummons to visit the patient. She had by this time sufficiently\r\nrecovered to claim her discharge, and she had announced her intention of\r\nreturning forthwith to England. The head physician, feeling a sense of\r\nresponsibility, had sent for me. It was impossible to detain her on\r\nthe ground that she was not fit to be trusted by herself at large, in\r\nconsequence of the difference of opinion among the doctors on the case.\r\nAll that could be done was to give me due notice, and to leave the\r\nmatter in my hands. On seeing her for the second time, I found her\r\nsullen and reserved. She openly attributed my inability to find the\r\nnurse to want of zeal for her interests on my part. I had, on my side,\r\nno authority whatever to detain her. I could only inquire whether she\r\nhad money enough to pay her traveling expenses. Her reply informed me\r\nthat the chaplain of the hospital had mentioned her forlorn situation in\r\nthe town, and that the English residents had subscribed a small sum\r\nof money to enable her to return to her own country. Satisfied on this\r\nhead, I asked next if she had friends to go to in England. \xe2\x80\x9cI have one\r\nfriend,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is a host in herself--Lady Janet Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d You\r\nmay imagine my surprise when I heard this. I found it quite useless to\r\nmake any further inquiries as to how she came to know your aunt, whether\r\nyour aunt expected her, and so on. My questions evidently offended her;\r\nthey were received in sulky silence. Under these circumstances,\r\nwell knowing that I can trust implicitly to your humane sympathy for\r\nmisfortune, I have decided (after careful reflection) to insure the poor\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s safety when she arrives in London by giving her a letter\r\nto you. You will hear what she says, and you will be better able to\r\ndiscover than I am whether she really has any claim on Lady Janet Roy.\r\nOne last word of information, which it may be necessary to add, and I\r\nshall close this inordinately long letter. At my first interview with\r\nher I abstained, as I have already told you, from irritating her by any\r\ninquiries on the subject of her name. On this second occasion, however,\r\nI decided on putting the question.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he read those last words, Julian became aware of a sudden movement on\r\nthe part of his aunt. Lady Janet had risen softly from her chair and had\r\npassed behind him with the purpose of reading the consul\xe2\x80\x99s letter for\r\nherself over her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. Julian detected the action just in\r\ntime to frustrate Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s intention by placing his hand over the\r\nlast two lines of the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do that for?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired his aunt, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome, Lady Janet, to read the close of the letter for\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut before you do so I am anxious to prepare\r\nyou for a very great surprise. Compose yourself and let me read on\r\nslowly, with your eye on me, until I uncover the last two words which\r\nclose my friend\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read the end of the letter, as he had proposed, in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I looked the woman straight in the face, and I said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\ndenied that the name marked on the clothes which you wore when you came\r\nhere was your name. If you are not Mercy Merrick, who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nanswered, instantly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is ------\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian removed his hand from the page. Lady Janet looked at the next two\r\nwords, and started back with a loud cry of astonishment, which brought\r\nHorace instantly to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, one of you!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat name did she give?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGRACE ROSEBERRY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. A COUNCIL OF THREE.\r\n\r\nFOR a moment Horace stood thunderstruck, looking in blank astonishment\r\nat Lady Janet. His first words, as soon as he had recovered himself,\r\nwere addressed to Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this a joke?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\r\nis, I for one don\xe2\x80\x99t see the humor of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian pointed to the closely written pages of the consul\xe2\x80\x99s letter. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nman writes in earnest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he writes at such length as this.\r\nThe woman seriously gave the name of Grace Roseberry, and when she left\r\nMannheim she traveled to England for the express purpose of presenting\r\nherself to Lady Janet Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to his aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cYou saw me start,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you first mentioned Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s name in my\r\nhearing. Now you know why.\xe2\x80\x9d He addressed himself once more to Horace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard me say that you, as Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s future husband, had an\r\ninterest in being present at my interview with Lady Janet. Now _you_\r\nknow why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman is plainly mad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is certainly a\r\nstartling form of madness when one first hears of it. Of course we must\r\nkeep the matter, for the present at least, a secret from Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Grace must be kept in the\r\ndark, in her present state of health. The servants had better be warned\r\nbeforehand, in case of this adventuress or madwoman, whichever she may\r\nbe, attempting to make her way into the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat surprises _me_\r\nJulian (ring the bell, if you please), is that you should describe\r\nyourself in your letter as feeling an interest in this person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian answered--without ringing the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am more interested than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I find that Miss\r\nRoseberry herself is your guest at Mablethorpe House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were always perverse, Julian, as a child, in your likings and\r\ndislikings,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you ring the bell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one good reason, my dear aunt. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to hear you tell your\r\nservants to close the door on this friendless creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet cast a look at her nephew which plainly expressed that she\r\nthought he had taken a liberty with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to see the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in a tone of cold\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will not refuse to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian answered, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas out when she called. I must hear what she has to say--and I should\r\ninfinitely prefer hearing it in your presence. When I got your reply\r\nto my letter, permitting me to present her to you, I wrote to her\r\nimmediately, appointing a meeting here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet lifted her bright black eyes in mute expostulation to the\r\ncarved Cupids and wreaths on the dining-room ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen am I to have the honor of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s visit?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, with\r\nironical resignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day,\xe2\x80\x9d answered her nephew, with impenetrable patience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian composedly consulted his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is ten minutes after her\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and put his watch back in his pocket again.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the servant appeared, and advanced to Julian,\r\ncarrying a visiting card on his little silver tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady to see you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian took the card, and, bowing, handed it to his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere she is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, just as quietly as ever.\r\n\r\nLady Janet looked at the card, and tossed it indignantly back to her\r\nnephew. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Roseberry!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cPrinted--actually printed on\r\nher card! Julian, even MY patience has its limits. I refuse to see her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant was still waiting--not like a human being who took an\r\ninterest in the proceedings, but (as became a perfectly bred footman)\r\nlike an article of furniture artfully constructed to come and go at\r\nthe word of command. Julian gave the word of command, addressing the\r\nadmirably constructed automaton by the name of \xe2\x80\x9cJames.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the lady now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the breakfast-room, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her there, if you please, and wait outside within hearing of the\r\nbell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe legs of the furniture-footman acted, and took him noiselessly out of\r\nthe room. Julian turned to his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor venturing to give the man his orders in your\r\npresence. I am very anxious that you should not decide hastily. Surely\r\nwe ought to hear what this lady has to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace dissented widely from his friend\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an insult to\r\nGrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cto hear what she has to say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet nodded her head in high approval. \xe2\x80\x9cI think so, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\nladyship, crossing her handsome old hands resolutely on her lap.\r\n\r\nJulian applied himself to answering Horace first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no intention of presuming to reflect on\r\nMiss Roseberry, or of bringing her into the matter at all.--The consul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, speaking to his aunt, \xe2\x80\x9cmentions, if you remember,\r\nthat the medical authorities of Mannheim were divided in opinion on\r\ntheir patient\xe2\x80\x99s case. Some of them--the physician-in-chief being among\r\nthe number--believe that the recovery of her mind has not accompanied\r\nthe recovery of her body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet remarked, \xe2\x80\x9ca madwoman is in my house, and I\r\nam expected to receive her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us exaggerate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can serve no good\r\ninterest, in this serious matter, to exaggerate anything. The consul\r\nassures us, on the authority of the doctor, that she is perfectly gentle\r\nand harmless. If she is really the victim of a mental delusion, the poor\r\ncreature is surely an object of compassion, and she ought to be placed\r\nunder proper care. Ask your own kind heart, my dear aunt, if it would\r\nnot be downright cruelty to turn this forlorn woman adrift in the world\r\nwithout making some inquiry first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s inbred sense of justice admitted not over willingly--the\r\nreasonableness as well as the humanity of the view expressed in those\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is some truth in that, Julian,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shifting her\r\nposition uneasily in her chair, and looking at Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nso, too?\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I do,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Horace, in the positive tone of a man whose\r\nobstinacy is proof against every form of appeal that can be addressed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe patience of Julian was firm enough to be a match for the obstinacy\r\nof Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, with undiminished good temper, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nare all three equally interested in setting this matter at rest. I put\r\nit to you, Lady Janet, if we are not favored, at this lucky moment, with\r\nthe very opportunity that we want? Miss Roseberry is not only out of the\r\nroom, but out of the house. If we let this chance slip, who can say what\r\nawkward accident may not happen in the course of the next few days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the woman come in,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Janet, deciding headlong, with her\r\ncustomary impatience of all delay. \xe2\x80\x9cAt once, Julian--before Grace can\r\ncome back. Will you ring the bell this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Julian rang it. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I give the man his orders?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrespectfully inquired of his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him anything you like, and have done with it!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the\r\nirritable old lady, getting briskly on her feet, and taking a turn in\r\nthe room to compose herself.\r\n\r\nThe servant withdrew, with orders to show the visitor in.\r\n\r\nHorace crossed the room at the same time--apparently with the intention\r\nof leaving it by the door at the opposite end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going away?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no use in my remaining here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Horace, not very\r\ngraciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Lady Janet, \xe2\x80\x9cremain here because I wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly--if you wish it. Only remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, more obstinately\r\nthan ever, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I differ entirely from Julian\xe2\x80\x99s view. In my opinion the\r\nwoman has no claim on us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA passing movement of irritation escaped Julian for the first time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be hard, Horace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cAll women have a claim on\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had unconsciously gathered together, in the heat of the little\r\ndebate, turning their backs on the library door. At the last words\r\nof the reproof administered by Julian to Horace, their attention was\r\nrecalled to passing events by the slight noise produced by the opening\r\nand closing of the door. With one accord the three turned and looked in\r\nthe direction from which the sounds had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE DEAD ALIVE.\r\n\r\nJUST inside the door there appeared the figure of a small woman dressed\r\nin plain and poor black garments. She silently lifted her black net veil\r\nand disclosed a dull, pale, worn, weary face. The forehead was low\r\nand broad; the eyes were unusually far apart; the lower features were\r\nremarkably small and delicate. In health (as the consul at Mannheim had\r\nremarked) this woman must have possessed, if not absolute beauty,\r\nat least rare attractions peculiarly her own. As it was now,\r\nsuffering--sullen, silent, self-contained suffering--had marred its\r\nbeauty. Attention and even curiosity it might still rouse. Admiration or\r\ninterest it could excite no longer.\r\n\r\nThe small, thin, black figure stood immovably inside the door. The dull,\r\nworn, white face looked silently at the three persons in the room.\r\n\r\nThe three persons in the room, on their side, stood for a moment without\r\nmoving, and looked silently at the stranger on the threshold. There was\r\nsomething either in the woman herself, or in the sudden and stealthy\r\nmanner of her appearance in the room, which froze, as if with the touch\r\nof an invisible cold hand, the sympathies of all three. Accustomed to\r\nthe world, habitually at their ease in every social emergency, they\r\nwere now silenced for the first time in their lives by the first serious\r\nsense of embarrassment which they had felt since they were children in\r\nthe presence of a stranger.\r\n\r\nHad the appearance of the true Grace Roseberry aroused in their minds a\r\nsuspicion of the woman who had stolen her name, and taken her place in\r\nthe house?\r\n\r\nNot so much as the shadow of a suspicion of Mercy was at the bottom of\r\nthe strange sense of uneasiness which had now deprived them alike of\r\ntheir habitual courtesy and their habitual presence of mind. It was as\r\npractically impossible for any one of the three to doubt the identity of\r\nthe adopted daughter of the house as it would be for you who read these\r\nlines to doubt the identity of the nearest and dearest relative you have\r\nin the world. Circumstances had fortified Mercy behind the strongest of\r\nall natural rights--the right of first possession. Circumstances had\r\narmed her with the most irresistible of all natural forces--the force\r\nof previous association and previous habit. Not by so much as a\r\nhair-breadth was the position of the false Grace Roseberry shaken by\r\nthe first appearance of the true Grace Roseberry within the doors of\r\nMablethorpe House. Lady Janet felt suddenly repelled, without knowing\r\nwhy. Julian and Horace felt suddenly repelled, without knowing why.\r\nAsked to describe their own sensations at the moment, they would have\r\nshaken their heads in despair, and would have answered in those words.\r\nThe vague presentiment of some misfortune to come had entered the room\r\nwith the entrance of the woman in black. But it moved invisibly; and it\r\nspoke as all presentiments speak, in the Unknown Tongue.\r\n\r\nA moment passed. The crackling of the fire and the ticking of the clock\r\nwere the only sounds audible in the room.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the visitor--hard, clear, and quiet--was the first voice\r\nthat broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Julian Gray?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking interrogatively from one of the two\r\ngentlemen to the other.\r\n\r\nJulian advanced a few steps, instantly recovering his self-possession.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry I was not at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you called with your\r\nletter from the consul. Pray take a chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy way of setting the example, Lady Janet seated herself at some little\r\ndistance, with Horace in attendance standing near. She bowed to the\r\nstranger with studious politeness, but without uttering a word, before\r\nshe settled herself in her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to listen to this\r\nperson,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am _not_ obliged to speak to her.\r\nThat is Julian\xe2\x80\x99s business--not mine. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stand, Horace! You fidget me.\r\nSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d Armed beforehand in her policy of silence, Lady Janet folded\r\nher handsome hands as usual, and waited for the proceedings to begin,\r\nlike a judge on the bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take a chair?\xe2\x80\x9d Julian repeated, observing that the visitor\r\nappeared neither to heed nor to hear his first words of welcome to her.\r\n\r\nAt this second appeal she spoke to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that Lady Janet Roy?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, with her eyes fixed on the mistress of the house.\r\n\r\nJulian answered, and drew back to watch the result.\r\n\r\nThe woman in the poor black garments changed her position for the first\r\ntime. She moved slowly across the room to the place at which Lady Janet\r\nwas sitting, and addressed her respectfully with perfect self-possession\r\nof manner. Her whole demeanor, from the moment when she had appeared at\r\nthe door, had expressed--at once plainly and becomingly--confidence in\r\nthe reception that awaited her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost the last words my father said to me on his death-bed,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nbegan, \xe2\x80\x9cwere words, madam, which told me to expect protection and\r\nkindness from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s business to speak. She listened with the\r\nblandest attention. She waited with the most exasperating silence to\r\nhear more.\r\n\r\nGrace Roseberry drew back a step--not intimidated--only mortified and\r\nsurprised. \xe2\x80\x9cWas my father wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a simple dignity\r\nof tone and manner which forced Lady Janet to abandon her policy of\r\nsilence, in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was your father?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, coldly.\r\n\r\nGrace Roseberry answered the question in a tone of stern surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the servant not given you my card?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know my\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of your names?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your ladyship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make myself understood. You asked me if I knew your name. I\r\nask you, in return, which name it is? The name on your card is \xe2\x80\x98Miss\r\nRoseberry.\xe2\x80\x99 The name marked on your clothes, when you were in the\r\nhospital, was \xe2\x80\x98Mercy Merrick.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe self-possession which Grace had maintained from the moment when she\r\nhad entered the dining-room, seemed now, for the first time, to be on\r\nthe point of failing her. She turned, and looked appealingly at Julian,\r\nwho had thus far kept his place apart, listening attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour friend, the consul, has told you in his letter\r\nabout the mark on the clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething of the girlish hesitation and timidity which had marked her\r\ndemeanor at her interview with Mercy in the French cottage re-appeared\r\nin her tone and manner as she spoke those words. The changes--mostly\r\nchanges for the worse--wrought in her by the suffering through which she\r\nhad passed since that time were now (for the moment) effaced. All that\r\nwas left of the better and simpler side of her character asserted itself\r\nin her brief appeal to Julian. She had hitherto repelled him. He began\r\nto feel a certain compassionate interest in her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe consul has informed me of what you said to him,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered,\r\nkindly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, if you will take my advice, I recommend you to tell your\r\nstory to Lady Janet in your own words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace again addressed herself with submissive reluctance to Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe clothes your ladyship speaks of,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwere the clothes of\r\nanother woman. The rain was pouring when the soldiers detained me on the\r\nfrontier. I had been exposed for hours to the weather--I was wet to the\r\nskin. The clothes marked \xe2\x80\x98Mercy Merrick\xe2\x80\x99 were the clothes lent to me by\r\nMercy Merrick herself while my own things were drying. I was struck\r\nby the shell in those clothes. I was carried away insensible in those\r\nclothes after the operation had been performed on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet listened to perfection--and did no more. She turned\r\nconfidentially to Horace, and said to him, in her gracefully ironical\r\nway: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is ready with her explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace answered in the same tone: \xe2\x80\x9cA great deal too ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace looked from one of them to the other. A faint flush of color\r\nshowed itself in her face for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with proud composure, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet maintained her policy of silence. She waved one hand\r\ncourteously toward Julian, as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAddress your inquiries to\r\nthe gentleman who introduces you.\xe2\x80\x9d Julian, noticing the gesture, and\r\nobserving the rising color in Grace\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, interfered directly in the\r\ninterests of peace\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet asked you a question just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet\r\ninquired who your father was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was the late Colonel Roseberry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet made another confidential remark to Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cHer assurance\r\namazes me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nJulian interposed before his aunt could add a word more. \xe2\x80\x9cPray let us\r\nhear her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a tone of entreaty which had something of the\r\nimperative in it this time. He turned to Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any proof to\r\nproduce,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in his gentler voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich will satisfy us that\r\nyou are Colonel Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace looked at him indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cProof!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIs my word not\r\nenough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian kept his temper perfectly. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget\r\nthat you and Lady Janet meet now for the first time. Try to put yourself\r\nin my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s place. How is she to know that you are the late Colonel\r\nRoseberry\xe2\x80\x99s daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s head sunk on her breast; she dropped into the nearest chair. The\r\nexpression of her face changed instantly from anger to discouragement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cif I only had the letters that have been\r\nstolen from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLetters,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Julian, \xe2\x80\x9cintroducing you to Lady Janet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned suddenly to Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you how I lost\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in the first tones of entreaty which had escaped her\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nLady Janet hesitated. It was not in her generous nature to resist the\r\nappeal that had just been made to her. The sympathies of Horace were far\r\nless easily reached. He lightly launched a new shaft of satire--intended\r\nfor the private amusement of Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother explanation!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, with a look of comic resignation.\r\n\r\nJulian overheard the words. His large lustrous eyes fixed themselves on\r\nHorace with a look of unmeasured contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe least you can do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cis not to irritate her. It\r\nis so easy to irritate her!\xe2\x80\x9d He addressed himself again to Grace,\r\nendeavoring to help her through her difficulty in a new way. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\r\nexplaining yourself for the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the absence of your\r\nletters, have you any one in London who can speak to your identity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace shook her head sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no friends in London,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Lady Janet--who had never in her life heard of\r\nanybody without friends in London--to pass this over without notice. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nfriends in London!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, turning to Horace.\r\n\r\nHorace shot another shaft of light satire. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not!\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined.\r\n\r\nGrace saw them comparing notes. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friends are in Canada,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke\r\nout, impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of friends who could speak for me, if I could\r\nonly bring them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a place of reference--mentioned in the capital city of\r\nEngland--Canada, there is no denying it, is open to objection on the\r\nground of distance. Horace was ready with another shot. \xe2\x80\x9cFar enough off,\r\ncertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar enough off, as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet agreed.\r\n\r\nOnce more Julian\xe2\x80\x99s inexhaustible kindness strove to obtain a hearing for\r\nthe stranger who had been confided to his care. \xe2\x80\x9cA little patience, Lady\r\nJanet,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cA little consideration, Horace, for a friendless\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very kind of you to try and help\r\nme, but it is useless. They won\xe2\x80\x99t even listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d She attempted to\r\nrise from her chair as she pronounced the last words. Julian gently laid\r\nhis hand on her shoulder and obliged her to resume her seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ will listen to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou referred me just now to the\r\nconsul\xe2\x80\x99s letter. The consul tells me you suspected some one of taking\r\nyour papers and your clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d was the quick reply; \xe2\x80\x9cI am certain! I tell you\r\npositively Mercy Merrick was the thief. She was alone with me when I was\r\nstruck down by the shell. She was the only person who knew that I had\r\nletters of introduction about me. She confessed to my face that she\r\nhad been a bad woman--she had been in a prison--she had come out of a\r\nrefuge--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian stopped her there with one plain question, which threw a doubt on\r\nthe whole story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe consul tells me you asked him to search for Mercy Merrick,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not true that he caused inquiries to be made, and that no\r\ntrace of any such person was to be heard of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe consul took no pains to find her,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace answered, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nwas, like everybody else, in a conspiracy to neglect and misjudge me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet and Horace exchanged looks. This time it was impossible for\r\nJulian to blame them. The further the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s narrative advanced, the\r\nless worthy of serious attention he felt it to be. The longer she spoke,\r\nthe more disadvantageously she challenged comparison with the absent\r\nwoman, whose name she so obstinately and so audaciously persisted in\r\nassuming as her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranting all that you have said,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian resumed, with a last effort\r\nof patience, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat use could Mercy Merrick make of your letters and your\r\nclothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat use?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Grace, amazed at his not seeing the position as\r\nshe saw it. \xe2\x80\x9cMy clothes were marked with my name. One of my papers was\r\na letter from my father, introducing me to Lady Janet. A woman out of a\r\nrefuge would be quite capable of presenting herself here in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpoken entirely at random, spoken without so much as a fragment of\r\nevidence to support them, those last words still had their effect.\r\nThey cast a reflection on Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s adopted daughter which was too\r\noutrageous to be borne. Lady Janet rose instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me your arm,\r\nHorace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning to leave the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace respectfully offered his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship is quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cA more monstrous story never was invented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, in the warmth of his indignation, loud enough for Grace to\r\nhear him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there monstrous in it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, advancing a step\r\ntoward him, defiantly.\r\n\r\nJulian checked her. He too--though he had only once seen Mercy--felt\r\nan angry sense of the insult offered to the beautiful creature who had\r\ninterested him at his first sight of her. \xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking\r\nsternly to Grace for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are offending--justly\r\noffending--Lady Janet. You are talking worse than absurdly--you are\r\ntalking offensively--when you speak of another woman presenting herself\r\nhere in your place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s blood was up. Stung by Julian\xe2\x80\x99s reproof, she turned on him a\r\nlook which was almost a look of fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a clergyman? Are you an educated man?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nnever read of cases of false personation, in newspapers and books? I\r\nblindly confided in Mercy Merrick before I found out what her character\r\nreally was. She left the cottage--I know it, from the surgeon who\r\nbrought me to life again--firmly persuaded that the shell had killed me.\r\nMy papers and my clothes disappeared at the same time. Is there nothing\r\nsuspicious in these circumstances? There were people at the Hospital who\r\nthought them highly suspicious--people who warned me that I might find\r\nan impostor in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly paused. The rustling sound of\r\na silk dress had caught her ear. Lady Janet was leaving the room, with\r\nHorace, by way of the conservatory. With a last desperate effort of\r\nresolution, Grace sprung forward and placed herself in front of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word, Lady Janet, before you turn your back on me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nfirmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOne word, and I will be content. Has Colonel Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nfound its way to this house or not? If it has, did a woman bring it to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet looked--as only a great lady can look, when a person of\r\ninferior rank has presumed to fail in respect toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are surely not aware,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with icy composure, \xe2\x80\x9cthat these\r\nquestions are an insult to Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd worse than an insult,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace added, warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cto Grace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little resolute black figure (still barring the way to the\r\nconservatory) was suddenly shaken from head to foot. The woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\ntraveled backward and forward between Lady Janet and Horace with the\r\nlight of a new suspicion in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Grace? That\xe2\x80\x99s my name. Lady Janet, you\r\n_have_ got the letter! The woman is here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet dropped Horace\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and retraced her steps to the place at\r\nwhich her nephew was standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulian,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou force me, for the first time in my life, to\r\nremind you of the respect that is due to me in my own house. Send that\r\nwoman away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to be answered, she turned back again, and once more\r\ntook Horace\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand back, if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly, to Grace.\r\n\r\nGrace held her ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman is here!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cConfront me with her--and then send\r\nme away, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian advanced, and firmly took her by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget what is due\r\nto Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drawing her aside. \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget what is due to\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a desperate effort, Grace broke away from him, and stopped Lady\r\nJanet on the threshold of the conservatory door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJustice!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, shaking her clinched hand with hysterical frenzy\r\nin the air. \xe2\x80\x9cI claim my right to meet that woman face to face! Where is\r\nshe? Confront me with her! Confront me with her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile those wild words were pouring from her lips, the rumbling of\r\ncarriage wheels became audible on the drive in front of the house.\r\nIn the all-absorbing agitation of the moment, the sound of the wheels\r\n(followed by the opening of the house door) passed unnoticed by the\r\npersons in the dining-room. Horace\xe2\x80\x99s voice was still raised in angry\r\nprotest against the insult offered to Lady Janet; Lady Janet herself\r\n(leaving him for the second time) was vehemently ringing the bell to\r\nsummon the servants; Julian had once more taken the infuriated woman by\r\nthe arms and was trying vainly to compose her--when the library door\r\nwas opened quietly by a young lady wearing a mantle and a bonnet. Mercy\r\nMerrick (true to the appointment which she had made with Horace) entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe first eyes that discovered her presence on the scene were the eyes\r\nof Grace Roseberry. Starting violently in Julian\xe2\x80\x99s grasp, she pointed\r\ntoward the library door. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a shriek of vindictive\r\ndelight. \xe2\x80\x9cThere she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy turned as the sound of the scream rang through the room, and\r\nmet--resting on her in savage triumph--the living gaze of the woman\r\nwhose identity she had stolen, whose body she had left laid out for\r\ndead. On the instant of that terrible discovery--with her eyes fixed\r\nhelplessly on the fierce eyes that had found her--she dropped senseless\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. EXIT JULIAN.\r\n\r\nJULIAN happened to be standing nearest to Mercy. He was the first at her\r\nside when she fell.\r\n\r\nIn the cry of alarm which burst from him, as he raised her for a\r\nmoment in his arms, in the expression of his eyes when he looked at her\r\ndeath-like face, there escaped the plain--too plain--confession of the\r\ninterest which he felt in her, of the admiration which she had aroused\r\nin him. Horace detected it. There was the quick suspicion of jealousy in\r\nthe movement by which he joined Julian; there was the ready resentment\r\nof jealousy in the tone in which he pronounced the words, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave her to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d Julian resigned her in silence. A faint flush appeared on his pale\r\nface as he drew back while Horace carried her to the sofa. His eyes sunk\r\nto the ground; he seemed to be meditating self-reproachfully on the tone\r\nin which his friend had spoken to him. After having been the first to\r\ntake an active part in meeting the calamity that had happened, he was\r\nnow, to all appearance, insensible to everything that was passing in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nA touch on his shoulder roused him.\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked round. The woman who had done the mischief--the\r\nstranger in the poor black garments--was standing behind him. She\r\npointed to the prostrate figure on the sofa, with a merciless smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted a proof just now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace heard her. He suddenly left the sofa and joined Julian. His face,\r\nnaturally ruddy, was pale with suppressed fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that wretch away!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cInstantly! or I won\xe2\x80\x99t answer for what\r\nI may do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words recalled Julian to himself. He looked round the room. Lady\r\nJanet and the housekeeper were together, in attendance on the swooning\r\nwoman. The startled servants were congregated in the library doorway.\r\nOne of them offered to run to the nearest doctor; another asked if he\r\nshould fetch the police. Julian silenced them by a gesture, and turned\r\nto Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cCompose yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me to remove her quietly\r\nfrom the house.\xe2\x80\x9d He took Grace by the hand as he spoke. She hesitated,\r\nand tried to release herself. Julian pointed to the group at the sofa,\r\nand to the servants looking on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have made an enemy of every one in\r\nthis room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you have not a friend in London. Do you wish\r\nto make an enemy of _me?_ Her head drooped; she made no reply; she\r\nwaited, dumbly obedient to the firmer will than her own. Julian ordered\r\nthe servants crowding together in the doorway to withdraw. He followed\r\nthem into the library, leading Grace after him by the hand. Before\r\nclosing the door he paused, and looked back into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she recovering?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s voice answered him. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I send for the nearest doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace interposed. He declined to let Julian associate himself, even in\r\nthat indirect manner, with Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the doctor is wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go for him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian closed the library door. He absently released Grace; he\r\nmechanically pointed to a chair. She sat down in silent surprise,\r\nfollowing him with her eyes as he walked slowly to and fro in the room.\r\n\r\nFor the moment his mind was far away from her, and from all that had\r\nhappened since her appearance in the house. It was impossible that a\r\nman of his fineness of perception could mistake the meaning of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct toward him. He was questioning his own heart, on the subject of\r\nMercy, sternly and unreservedly as it was his habit to do. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter only\r\nonce seeing her,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9chas she produced such an impression on me\r\nthat Horace can discover it, before I have even suspected it myself?\r\nCan the time have come already when I owe it to my friend to see her no\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped irritably in his walk. As a man devoted to a serious\r\ncalling in life, there was something that wounded his self-respect in\r\nthe bare suspicion that he could be guilty of the purely sentimental\r\nextravagance called \xe2\x80\x9clove at first sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had paused exactly opposite to the chair in which Grace was seated.\r\nWeary of the silence, she seized the opportunity of speaking to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here with you as you wished,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to\r\nhelp me? Am I to count on you as my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her vacantly. It cost him an effort before he could give\r\nher the attention that she had claimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been hard on me,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you showed me some\r\nkindness at first; you tried to make them give me a fair hearing. I ask\r\nyou, as a just man, do you doubt now that the woman on the sofa in\r\nthe next room is an impostor who has taken my place? Can there be any\r\nplainer confession that she is Mercy Merrick than the confession she has\r\nmade? _You_ saw it; _they_ saw it. She fainted at the sight of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian crossed the room--still without answering her--and rang the bell.\r\nWhen the servant appeared, he told the man to fetch a cab.\r\n\r\nGrace rose from her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the cab for?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you and for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to take you back to\r\nyour lodgings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI refuse to go. My place is in this house. Neither Lady Janet nor you\r\ncan get over the plain facts. All I asked was to be confronted with\r\nher. And what did she do when she came into the room? She fainted at the\r\nsight of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReiterating her one triumphant assertion, she fixed her eyes on Julian\r\nwith a look which said plainly: Answer that if you can. In mercy to her,\r\nJulian answered it on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou appear to take it for granted\r\nthat no innocent woman would have fainted on first seeing you. I have\r\nsomething to tell you which will alter your opinion. On her arrival\r\nin England this lady informed my aunt that she had met with you\r\naccidentally on the French frontier, and that she had seen you (so far\r\nas she knew) struck dead at her side by a shell. Remember that, and\r\nrecall what happened just now. Without a word to warn her of your\r\nrestoration to life, she finds herself suddenly face to face with you,\r\na living woman--and this at a time when it is easy for any one who looks\r\nat her to see that she is in delicate health. What is there wonderful,\r\nwhat is there unaccountable, in her fainting under such circumstances as\r\nthese?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was plainly put. Where was the answer to it?\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to it. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s wisely candid statement of the manner\r\nin which she had first met with Grace, and of the accident which\r\nhad followed had served Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s purpose but too well. It was simply\r\nimpossible for persons acquainted with that statement to attach a guilty\r\nmeaning to the swoon. The false Grace Roseberry was still as far beyond\r\nthe reach of suspicion as ever, and the true Grace was quick enough to\r\nsee it. She sank into the chair from which she had risen; her hands fell\r\nin hopeless despair on her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is against me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth itself turns liar, and\r\ntakes _her_ side.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and rallied her sinking courage. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she cried, resolutely, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t submit to have my name and my place\r\ntaken from me by a vile adventuress! Say what you like, I insist on\r\nexposing her; I won\xe2\x80\x99t leave the house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant entered the room, and announced that the cab was at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nGrace turned to Julian with a defiant wave of her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\ndetain you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI see I have neither advice nor help to expect\r\nfrom Mr. Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian beckoned to the servant to follow him into a corner of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know if the doctor has been sent for?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe not, sir. It is said in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall that the doctor is\r\nnot wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian was too anxious to be satisfied with a report from the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhall. He hastily wrote on a slip of paper: \xe2\x80\x9cHas she recovered?\xe2\x80\x9d and gave\r\nthe note to the man, with directions to take it to Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear what I said?\xe2\x80\x9d Grace inquired, while the messenger was\r\nabsent in the dining room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer you directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian.\r\n\r\nThe servant appeared again as he spoke, with some lines in pencil\r\nwritten by Lady Janet on the back of Julian\xe2\x80\x99s note. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God, we have\r\nrevived her. In a few minutes we hope to be able to take her to her\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nearest way to Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s room was through the library. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimmediate removal had now become a necessity which was not to be trifled\r\nwith. Julian addressed himself to meeting the difficulty the instant he\r\nwas left alone with Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cab is waiting, and I have my last words\r\nto say to you. You are now (thanks to the consul\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation) in my\r\ncare. Decide at once whether you will remain under my charge, or whether\r\nyou will transfer yourself to the charge of the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace started. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to remain under my charge,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\naccompany me at once to the cab. In that case I will undertake to give\r\nyou an opportunity of telling your story to my own lawyer. He will be a\r\nfitter person to advise you than I am. Nothing will induce we to believe\r\nthat the lady whom you have accused has committed, or is capable of\r\ncommitting, such a fraud as you charge her with. You will hear what\r\nthe lawyer thinks, if you come with me. If you refuse, I shall have no\r\nchoice but to send into the next room, and tell them that you are still\r\nhere. The result will be that you will find yourself in charge of the\r\npolice. Take which course you like: I will give you a minute to decide\r\nin. And remember this--if I appear to express myself harshly, it is your\r\nconduct which forces me to speak out. I mean kindly toward you; I am\r\nadvising you honestly for your good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out his watch to count the minute.\r\n\r\nGrace stole one furtive glance at his steady, resolute face. She was\r\nperfectly unmoved by the manly consideration for her which Julian\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nwords had expressed. All she understood was that he was not a man to be\r\ntrifled with. Future opportunities would offer themselves of returning\r\nsecretly to the house. She determined to yield--and deceive him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rising with dogged submission. \xe2\x80\x9cYour turn\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered to herself, as she turned to the looking-glass to\r\narrange her shawl. \xe2\x80\x9cMy turn will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian advanced toward her, as if to offer her his arm, and checked\r\nhimself. Firmly persuaded as he was that her mind was deranged--readily\r\nas he admitted that she claimed, in virtue of her affliction, every\r\nindulgence that he could extend to her--there was something repellent\r\nto him at that moment in the bare idea of touching her. The image of the\r\nbeautiful creature who was the object of her monstrous accusation--the\r\nimage of Mercy as she lay helpless for a moment in his arms--was vivid\r\nin his mind while he opened the door that led into the hall, and drew\r\nback to let Grace pass out before him. He left the servant to help her\r\ninto the cab. The man respectfully addressed him as he took his seat\r\nopposite to Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ordered to say that your room is ready, sir, and that her ladyship\r\nexpects you to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in the events which had followed his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, Julian\r\nhad forgotten his engagement to stay at Mablethorpe House. Could he\r\nreturn, knowing his own heart as he now knew it? Could he honorably\r\nremain, perhaps for weeks together, in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s society, conscious as\r\nhe now was of the impression which she had produced on him? No. The\r\none honorable course that he could take was to find an excuse for\r\nwithdrawing from his engagement. \xe2\x80\x9cBeg her ladyship not to wait dinner\r\nfor me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will write and make my apologies.\xe2\x80\x9d The cab drove\r\noff. The wondering servant waited on the doorstep, looking after it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand in Mr. Julian\xe2\x80\x99s shoes for something,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, with\r\nhis mind running on the difficulties of the young clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s position.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she is along with him in the cab. What is he going to do with her\r\nafter that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian himself, if it had been put to him at the moment, could not have\r\nanswered the question.\r\n\r\n              *****\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety was far from being relieved when Mercy had been\r\nrestored to her senses and conducted to her own room.\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s mind remained in a condition of unreasoning alarm, which it was\r\nimpossible to remove. Over and over again she was told that the woman\r\nwho had terrified her had left the house, and would never be permitted\r\nto enter it more; over and over again she was assured that the\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x99s frantic assertions were regarded by everybody about her as\r\nunworthy of a moment\xe2\x80\x99s serious attention. She persisted in doubting\r\nwhether they were telling her the truth. A shocking distrust of her\r\nfriends seemed to possess her. She shrunk when Lady Janet approached the\r\nbedside. She shuddered when Lady Janet kissed her. She flatly refused to\r\nlet Horace see her. She asked the strangest questions about Julian Gray,\r\nand shook her head suspiciously when they told her that he was absent\r\nfrom the house. At intervals she hid her face in the bedclothes and\r\nmurmured to herself piteously, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what shall I do? What shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n At other times her one petition was to be left alone. \xe2\x80\x9cI want nobody in\r\nmy room\xe2\x80\x9d--that was her sullen cry--\xe2\x80\x9cnobody in my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe evening advanced, and brought with it no change for the better. Lady\r\nJanet, by the advice of Horace, sent for her own medical adviser.\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. The symptoms, he said, indicated a serious\r\nshock to the nervous system. He wrote a sedative prescription; and he\r\ngave (with a happy choice of language) some sound and safe advice. It\r\namounted briefly to this: \xe2\x80\x9cTake her away, and try the sea-side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s customary energy acted on the advice, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneedless delay. She gave the necessary directions for packing the trunks\r\novernight, and decided on leaving Mablethorpe House with Mercy the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nShortly after the doctor had taken his departure a letter from Julian,\r\naddressed to Lady Janet, was delivered by private messenger.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the necessary apologies for the writer\xe2\x80\x99s absence, the\r\nletter proceeded in these terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I permitted my companion to see the lawyer, I felt the necessity\r\nof consulting him as to my present position toward her first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him--what I think it only right to repeat to you--that I do not\r\nfeel justified in acting on my own opinion that her mind is deranged.\r\nIn the case of this friendless woman I want medical authority, and, more\r\neven than that, I want some positive proof, to satisfy my conscience as\r\nwell as to confirm my view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinding me obstinate on this point, the lawyer undertook to consult a\r\nphysician accustomed to the treatment of the insane, on my behalf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter sending a message and receiving the answer, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Bring\r\nthe lady here--in half an hour; she shall tell her story to the doctor\r\ninstead of telling it to me.\xe2\x80\x99 The proposal rather staggered me; I asked\r\nhow it was possible to induce her to do that. He laughed, and answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall present the doctor as my senior partner; my senior partner will\r\nbe the very man to advise her.\xe2\x80\x99 You know that I hate all deception, even\r\nwhere the end in view appears to justify it. On this occasion, however,\r\nthere was no other alternative than to let the lawyer take his own\r\ncourse, or to run the risk of a delay which might be followed by serious\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited in a room by myself (feeling very uneasy, I own) until the\r\ndoctor joined me, after the interview was over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis opinion is, briefly, this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter careful examination of the unfortunate creature, he thinks that\r\nthere are unmistakably symptoms of mental aberration. But how far the\r\nmischief has gone, and whether her case is, or is not, sufficiently\r\ngrave to render actual restraint necessary, he cannot positively say, in\r\nour present state of ignorance as to facts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thus far,\xe2\x80\x99 he observed, \xe2\x80\x98we know nothing of that part of her delusion\r\nwhich relates to Mercy Merrick. The solution of the difficulty, in this\r\ncase, is to be found there. I entirely agree with the lady that the\r\ninquiries of the consul at Mannheim are far from being conclusive.\r\nFurnish me with satisfactory evidence either that there is, or is not,\r\nsuch a person really in existence as Mercy Merrick, and I will give you\r\na positive opinion on the case whenever you choose to ask for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose words have decided me on starting for the Continent and renewing\r\nthe search for Mercy Merrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend the lawyer wonders jocosely whether _I_ am in my right\r\nsenses. His advice is that I should apply to the nearest magistrate, and\r\nrelieve you and myself of all further trouble in that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you agree with him? My dear aunt (as you have often said), I\r\ndo nothing like other people. I am interested in this case. I cannot\r\nabandon a forlorn woman who has been confided to me to the tender\r\nmercies of strangers, so long as there is any hope of my making\r\ndiscoveries which may be instrumental in restoring her to\r\nherself--perhaps, also, in restoring her to her friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI start by the mail-train of to-night. My plan is to go first to\r\nMannheim and consult with the consul and the hospital doctors; then to\r\nfind my way to the German surgeon and to question _him_; and, that done,\r\nto make the last and hardest effort of all--the effort to trace the\r\nFrench ambulance and to penetrate the mystery of Mercy Merrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmediately on my return I will wait on you, and tell you what I have\r\naccomplished, or how I have failed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meanwhile, pray be under no alarm about the reappearance of this\r\nunhappy woman at your house. She is fully occupied in writing (at my\r\nsuggestion) to her friends in Canada; and she is under the care of the\r\nlandlady at her lodgings--an experienced and trustworthy person, who\r\nhas satisfied the doctor as well as myself of her fitness for the charge\r\nthat she has undertaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray mention this to Miss Roseberry (whenever you think it desirable),\r\nwith the respectful expression of my sympathy, and of my best wishes for\r\nher speedy restoration to health. And once more forgive me for failing,\r\nunder stress of necessity, to enjoy the hospitality of Mablethorpe\r\nHouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Janet closed Julian\xe2\x80\x99s letter, feeling far from satisfied with it.\r\nShe sat for a while, pondering over what her nephew had written to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of two things,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the quick-witted old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cEither the\r\nlawyer is right, and Julian is a fit companion for the madwoman whom he\r\nhas taken under his charge, or he has some second motive for this absurd\r\njourney of his which he has carefully abstained from mentioning in his\r\nletter. What can the motive be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt intervals during the night that question recurred to her ladyship\r\nagain and again. The utmost exercise of her ingenuity failing to answer\r\nit, her one resource left was to wait patiently for Julian\xe2\x80\x99s return,\r\nand, in her own favorite phrase, to \xe2\x80\x9chave it out of him\xe2\x80\x9d then.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Lady Janet and her adopted daughter left Mablethorpe\r\nHouse for Brighton; Horace (who had begged to be allowed to accompany\r\nthem) being sentenced to remain in London by Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s express desire.\r\nWhy--nobody could guess; and Mercy refused to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. ENTER JULIAN.\r\n\r\nA WEEK has passed. The scene opens again in the dining-room at\r\nMablethorpe House.\r\n\r\nThe hospitable table bears once more its burden of good things for\r\nlunch. But on this occasion Lady Janet sits alone. Her attention is\r\ndivided between reading her newspaper and feeding her cat. The cat is\r\na sleek and splendid creature. He carries an erect tail. He rolls\r\nluxuriously on the soft carpet. He approaches his mistress in a series\r\nof coquettish curves. He smells with dainty hesitation at the choicest\r\nmorsels that can be offered to him. The musical monotony of his purring\r\nfalls soothingly on her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s ear. She stops in the middle of a\r\nleading article and looks with a careworn face at the happy cat. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon\r\nmy honor,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Lady Janet, thinking, in her inveterately ironical\r\nmanner, of the cares that trouble her, \xe2\x80\x9call things considered, Tom, I\r\nwish I was You!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cat starts--not at his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s complimentary apostrophe, but at\r\na knock at the door, which follows close upon it. Lady Janet says,\r\ncarelessly enough, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in;\xe2\x80\x9d looks round listlessly to see who it is;\r\nand starts, like the cat, when the door opens and discloses--Julian\r\nGray!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--or your ghost?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaims.\r\n\r\nShe has noticed already that Julian is paler than usual, and that\r\nthere is something in his manner at once uneasy and subdued--highly\r\nuncharacteristic of him at other times. He takes a seat by her side,\r\nand kisses her hand. But--for the first time in his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s experience\r\nof him--he refuses the good things on the luncheon table, and he has\r\nnothing to say to the cat! That neglected animal takes refuge on Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s lap. Lady Janet, with her eyes fixed expectantly on her nephew\r\n(determining to \xe2\x80\x9chave it out of him\xe2\x80\x9d at the first opportunity), waits\r\nto hear what he has to say for himself. Julian has no alternative but to\r\nbreak the silence, and tell his story as he best may.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got back from the Continent last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I come here,\r\nas I promised, to report myself on my return. How does your ladyship do?\r\nHow is Miss Roseberry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet laid an indicative finger on the lace pelerine which\r\nornamented the upper part of her dress. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the old lady, well,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she answered--and pointed next to the room above them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she added, \xe2\x80\x9cis the young lady, ill. Is anything the matter with _you_,\r\nJulian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am a little tired after my journey. Never mind me. Is Miss\r\nRoseberry still suffering from the shock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else should she be suffering from? I will never forgive you,\r\nJulian, for bringing that crazy impostor into my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear aunt, when I was the innocent means of bringing her here I had\r\nno idea that such a person as Miss Roseberry was in existence. Nobody\r\nlaments what has happened more sincerely than I do. Have you had medical\r\nadvice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took her to the sea-side a week since by medical advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the change of air don e her no good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever. If anything, the change of air has made her worse.\r\nSometimes she sits for hours together, as pale as death, without looking\r\nat anything, and without uttering a word. Sometimes she brightens up,\r\nand seems as if she was eager to say something; and then Heaven only\r\nknows why, checks herself suddenly as if she was afraid to speak. I\r\ncould support that. But what cuts me to the heart, Julian, is, that she\r\ndoes not appear to trust me and to love me as she did. She seems to be\r\ndoubtful of me; she seems to be frightened of me. If I did not know that\r\nit was simply impossible that such a thing could be, I should really\r\nthink she suspected me of believing what that wretch said of her. In one\r\nword (and between ourselves), I begin to fear she will never get over\r\nthe fright which caused that fainting-fit. There is serious mischief\r\nsomewhere; and, try as I may to discover it, it is mischief beyond my\r\nfinding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan the doctor do nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s bright black eyes answered before she replied in words,\r\nwith a look of supreme contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, disdainfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought Grace back last\r\nnight in sheer despair, and I sent for the doctor this morning. He is at\r\nthe head of his profession; he is said to be making ten thousand a year;\r\nand he knows no more about it than I do. I am quite serious. The great\r\nphysician has just gone away with two guineas in his pocket. One guinea,\r\nfor advising me to keep her quiet; another guinea for telling me to\r\ntrust to time. Do you wonder how he gets on at this rate? My dear boy,\r\nthey all get on in the same way. The medical profession thrives on two\r\nincurable diseases in these modern days--a He-disease and a She-disease.\r\nShe-disease--nervous depression; He-disease--suppressed gout. Remedies,\r\none guinea, if _you_ go to the doctor; two guineas if the doctor goes\r\nto _you_. I might have bought a new bonnet,\xe2\x80\x9d cried her ladyship,\r\nindignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the money I have given to that man! Let us change the\r\nsubject. I lose my temper when I think of it. Besides, I want to know\r\nsomething. Why did you go abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that plain question Julian looked unaffectedly surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to\r\nexplain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you not received my letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I got your letter. It was long enough, in all conscience; and, long\r\nas it was, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me the one thing I wanted to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the \xe2\x80\x98one thing\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s reply pointed--not too palpably at first--at that second\r\nmotive for Julian\xe2\x80\x99s journey which she had suspected Julian of concealing\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you troubled yourself to make your\r\ninquiries on the Continent _in person?_ You know where my old courier is\r\nto be found. You have yourself pronounced him to be the most intelligent\r\nand trustworthy of men. Answer me honestly--could you not have sent him\r\nin your place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _might_ have sent him,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian admitted, a little reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have sent the courier--and you were under an engagement to\r\nstay here as my guest. Answer me honestly once more. Why did you go\r\naway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian hesitated. Lady Janet paused for his reply, with the air of\r\na women who was prepared to wait (if necessary) for the rest of the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a reason of my own for going,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Lady Janet, prepared to wait (if necessary) till the\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA reason,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I would rather not mention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother mystery--eh? And another woman at the\r\nbottom of it, no doubt. Thank you--that will do--I am sufficiently\r\nanswered. No wonder, as a clergyman, that you look a little confused.\r\nThere is, perhaps, a certain grace, under the circumstances, in looking\r\nconfused. We will change the subject again. You stay here, of course,\r\nnow you have come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more the famous pulpit orator seemed to find himself in the\r\ninconceivable predicament of not knowing what to say. Once more Lady\r\nJanet looked resigned to wait (if necessary) until the middle of next\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nJulian took refuge in an answer worthy of the most commonplace man on\r\nthe face of the civilized earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your ladyship to accept my thanks and my excuses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s many-ringed fingers, mechanically stroking the cat in her\r\nlap, began to stroke him the wrong way.\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s inexhaustible patience showed signs of failing her at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMighty civil, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMake it complete. Say, Mr. Julian\r\nGray presents his compliments to Lady Janet Roy, and regrets that a\r\nprevious engagement--Julian!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old lady, suddenly pushing\r\nthe cat off her lap, and flinging her last pretense of good temper\r\nto the winds--\xe2\x80\x9cJulian, I am not to be trifled with! There is but one\r\nexplanation of your conduct--you are evidently avoiding my house. Is\r\nthere somebody you dislike in it? Is it me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian intimated by a gesture that his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s last question was absurd.\r\n(The much-injured cat elevated his back, waved his tail slowly, walked\r\nto the fireplace, and honored the rug by taking a seat on it.)\r\n\r\nLady Janet persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it Grace Roseberry?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked next.\r\n\r\nEven Julian\xe2\x80\x99s patience began to show signs of yielding. His manner\r\nassumed a sudden decision, his voice rose a tone louder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou insist on knowing?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ Miss Roseberry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like her?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Janet, with a sudden burst of angry\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nJulian broke out, on his side: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I see any more of her,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered,\r\nthe rare color mounting passionately in his cheeks, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be the\r\nunhappiest man living. If I see any more of her, I shall be false to my\r\nold friend, who is to marry her. Keep us apart. If you have any regard\r\nfor my peace of mind, keep us apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnutterable amazement expressed itself in his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s lifted hands.\r\nUngovernable curiosity uttered itself in his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s next words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell me you are in love with Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian sprung restlessly to his feet, and disturbed the cat at the\r\nfireplace. (The cat left the room.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t realize it to myself.\r\nNo other woman has ever roused the feeling in me which this woman seems\r\nto have called to life in an instant. In the hope of forgetting her I\r\nbroke my engagement here; I purposely seized the opportunity of making\r\nthose inquiries abroad. Quite useless. I think of her, morning, noon,\r\nand night. I see her and hear her, at this moment, as plainly as I\r\nsee and hear you. She has made _her_self a part of _my_self. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand my life without her. My power of will seems to be gone. I\r\nsaid to myself this morning, \xe2\x80\x98I will write to my aunt; I won\xe2\x80\x99t go back\r\nto Mablethorpe House.\xe2\x80\x99 Here I am in Mablethorpe House, with a mean\r\nsubterfuge to justify me to my own conscience. \xe2\x80\x98I owe it to my aunt to\r\ncall on my aunt.\xe2\x80\x99 That is what I said to myself on the way here; and I\r\nwas secretly hoping every step of the way that she would come into the\r\nroom when I got here. I am hoping it now. And she is engaged to Horace\r\nHolmcroft--to my oldest friend, to my best friend! Am I an infernal\r\nrascal? or am I a weak fool? God knows--I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Keep my secret, aunt.\r\nI am heartily ashamed of myself; I used to think I was made of better\r\nstuff than this. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word to Horace. I must, and will, conquer\r\nit. Let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe snatched up his hat. Lady Janet, rising with the activity of a young\r\nwoman, pursued him across the room, and stopped him at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the resolute old lady, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go. Come back\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she said those words she noticed with a certain fond pride the\r\nbrilliant color mounting in his cheeks--the flashing brightness which\r\nlent an added luster to his eyes. He had never, to her mind, looked so\r\nhandsome before. She took his arm, and led him to the chairs which they\r\nhad just left. It was shocking, it was wrong (she mentally admitted) to\r\nlook on Mercy, under the circumstances, with any other eye than the\r\neye of a brother or a friend. In a clergyman (perhaps) doubly shocking,\r\ndoubly wrong. But, with all her respect for the vested interests\r\nof Horace, Lady Janet could not blame Julian. Worse still, she was\r\nprivately conscious that he had, somehow or other, risen, rather than\r\nfallen, in her estimation within the last minute or two. Who could deny\r\nthat her adopted daughter was a charming creature? Who could wonder if a\r\nman of refined tastes admired her? Upon the whole, her ladyship humanely\r\ndecided that her nephew was rather to be pitied than blamed. What\r\ndaughter of Eve (no matter whether she was seventeen or seventy) could\r\nhave honestly arrived at any other conclusion? Do what a man may--let\r\nhim commit anything he likes, from an error to a crime--so long as there\r\nis a woman at the bottom of it, there is an inexhaustible fund of pardon\r\nfor him in every other woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet,\r\nsmiling in spite of herself; \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t talk in that horrible way again.\r\nA man, Julian--especially a famous man like you--ought to know how to\r\ncontrol himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian burst out laughing bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend upstairs for my self-control,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in _her_\r\npossession--not in mine. Good morning, aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose from his chair. Lady Janet instantly pushed him back into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI insist on your staying here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif it is only for a few\r\nminutes longer. I have something to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it refer to Miss Roseberry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt refers to the hateful woman who frightened Miss Roseberry. Now are\r\nyou satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian bowed, and settled himself in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t much like to acknowledge it,\xe2\x80\x9d his aunt went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I want you\r\nto understand that I have something really serious to speak about,\r\nfor once in a way. Julian! that wretch not only frightens Grace--she\r\nactually frightens me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrightens you? She is quite harmless, poor thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Poor thing\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you say \xe2\x80\x98poor thing\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that you pity her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the bottom of my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady\xe2\x80\x99s temper gave way again at that reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate a man who\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t hate anybody!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you had been an ancient Roman,\r\nJulian, I believe you would have pitied Nero himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian cordially agreed with her. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I should,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll sinners, my dear aunt, are more or less miserable sinners.\r\nNero must have been one of the wretchedest of mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretched!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cNero wretched! A man who committed\r\nrobbery, arson and murder to his own violin accompaniment--_only_\r\nwretched! What next, I wonder? When modern philanthropy begins to\r\napologize for Nero, modern philanthropy has arrived at a pretty pass\r\nindeed! We shall hear next that Bloody Queen Mary was as playful as\r\na kitten; and if poor dear Henry the Eighth carried anything to an\r\nextreme, it was the practice of the domestic virtues. Ah, how I hate\r\ncant! What were we talking about just now? You wander from the subject,\r\nJulian; you are what I call bird-witted. I protest I forget what I\r\nwanted to say to you. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be reminded of it. I may be an old\r\nwoman, but I am not in my dotage yet! Why do you sit there staring? Have\r\nyou nothing to say for yourself? Of all the people in the world, have\r\n_you_ lost the use of your tongue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s excellent temper and accurate knowledge of his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s character\r\nexactly fitted him to calm the rising storm. He contrived to lead Lady\r\nJanet insensibly back to the lost subject by dexterous reference to\r\na narrative which he had thus far left untold--the narrative of his\r\nadventures on the Continent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a great deal to say, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not yet told you\r\nof my discoveries abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet instantly took the bait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew there was something forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been all\r\nthis time in the house, and you have told me nothing. Begin directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatient Julian began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI WENT first to Mannheim, Lady Janet, as I told you I should in my\r\nletter, and I heard all that the consul and the hospital doctors could\r\ntell me. No new fact of the slightest importance turned up. I got my\r\ndirections for finding the German surgeon, and I set forth to try what I\r\ncould make next of the man who performed the operation. On the question\r\nof his patient\xe2\x80\x99s identity he had (as a perfect stranger to her) nothing\r\nto tell me. On the question of her mental condition, however, he made a\r\nvery important statement. He owned to me that he had operated on another\r\nperson injured by a shell-wound on the head at the battle of Solferino,\r\nand that the patient (recovering also in this case) recovered--mad. That\r\nis a remarkable admission; don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s temper had hardly been allowed time enough to subside to\r\nits customary level.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery remarkable, I dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cto people who feel any\r\ndoubt of this pitiable lady of yours being mad. I feel no doubt--and,\r\nthus far, I find your account of yourself, Julian, tiresome in the\r\nextreme. Go on to the end. Did you lay your hand on Mercy Merrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear anything of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Difficulties beset me on every side. The French ambulance\r\nhad shared in the disasters of France--it was broken up. The wounded\r\nFrenchmen were prisoners somewhere in Germany, nobody knew where.\r\nThe French surgeon had been killed in action. His assistants were\r\nscattered--most likely in hiding. I began to despair of making any\r\ndiscovery, when accident threw in my way two Prussian soldiers who had\r\nbeen in the French cottage. They confirmed what the German surgeon told\r\nthe consul, and what Horace himself told _me_--namely, that no nurse\r\nin a black dress was to be seen in the place. If there had been such a\r\nperson, she would certainly (the Prussians inform me) have been found in\r\nattendance on the injured Frenchmen. The cross of the Geneva Convention\r\nwould have been amply sufficient to protect her: no woman wearing that\r\nbadge of honor would have disgraced herself by abandoning the wounded\r\nmen before the Germans entered the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Lady Janet, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no such person as Mercy\r\nMerrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can draw no other conclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian, \xe2\x80\x9cunless the English\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s idea is the right one. After hearing what I have just told you,\r\nhe thinks the woman herself is Mercy Merrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet held up her hand as a sign that she had an objection to make\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and the doctor seem to have settled everything to your entire\r\nsatisfaction on both sides,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is one difficulty that\r\nyou have neither of you accounted for yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk glibly enough, Julian, about this woman\xe2\x80\x99s mad assertion that\r\nGrace is the missing nurse, and that she is Grace. But you have not\r\nexplained yet how the idea first got into her head; and, more than that,\r\nhow it is that she is acquainted with my name and address, and perfectly\r\nfamiliar with Grace\xe2\x80\x99s papers and Grace\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. These things are a\r\npuzzle to a person of my average intelligence. Can your clever friend,\r\nthe doctor, account for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what he said when I saw him this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it take long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will take about a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou agreeably surprise me. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know how she gained her knowledge of your name and of Miss\r\nRoseberry\xe2\x80\x99s affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor says in one of two\r\nways. Either Miss Roseberry must have spoken of you and of her own\r\naffairs while she and the stranger were together in the French cottage,\r\nor the stranger must have obtained access privately to Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npapers. Do you agree so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet began to feel interested for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt Grace rashly talked of matters\r\nwhich an older and wiser person would have kept to herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Do you also agree that the last idea in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nwhen she was struck by the shell might have been (quite probably) the\r\nidea of Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s identity and Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s affairs? You\r\nthink it likely enough? Well, what happens after that? The wounded woman\r\nis brought to life by an operation, and she becomes delirious in the\r\nhospital at Mannheim. During her delirium the idea of Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nidentity ferments in her brain, and assumes its present perverted form.\r\nIn that form it still remains. As a necessary consequence, she persists\r\nin reversing the two identities. She says she is Miss Roseberry, and\r\ndeclares Miss Roseberry to be Mercy Merrick. There is the doctor \xe2\x80\x98s\r\nexplanation. What do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery ingenious, I dare say. The doctor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite satisfy me,\r\nhowever, for all that. I think--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat Lady Janet thought was not destined to be expressed. She suddenly\r\nchecked herself, and held up her hand for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother objection?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you say a word more I shall\r\nlose it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLose what, aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I wanted to say to you ages ago. I have got it back again--it\r\nbegins with a question. (No more of the doctor--I have had enough of\r\nhim!) Where is she--_your_ pitiable lady, _my_ crazy wretch--where is\r\nshe now? Still in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd still at large?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill with the landlady, at her lodgings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Now answer me this! What is to prevent her from making\r\nanother attempt to force her way (or steal her way) into my house? How\r\nam I to protect Grace, how am I to protect myself, if she comes here\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that really what you wished to speak to me about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, and nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were both too deeply interested in the subject of their\r\nconversation to look toward the conservatory, and to notice the\r\nappearance at that moment of a distant gentleman among the plants and\r\nflowers, who had made his way in from the garden outside. Advancing\r\nnoiselessly on the soft Indian matting, the gentleman ere long revealed\r\nhimself under the form and features of Horace Holmcroft. Before entering\r\nthe dining-room he paused, fixing his eyes inquisitively on the back\r\nof Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s visitor--the back being all that he could see in the\r\nposition he then occupied. After a pause of an instant the visitor\r\nspoke, and further uncertainty was at once at an end. Horace,\r\nnevertheless, made no movement to enter the room. He had his own jealous\r\ndistrust of what Julian might be tempted to say at a private interview\r\nwith his aunt; and he waited a little longer on the chance that his\r\ndoubts might be verified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither you nor Miss Roseberry need any protection from the poor\r\ndeluded creature,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI have gained great influence over\r\nher--and I have satisfied her that it is useless to present herself here\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Horace, speaking from the conservatory\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have done nothing of the sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(He had heard enough to satisfy him that the talk was not taking the\r\ndirection which his Suspicions had anticipated. And, as an additional\r\nincentive to show himself, a happy chance had now offered him the\r\nopportunity of putting Julian in the wrong.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Horace!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you come from?\r\nAnd what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard at the lodge that your ladyship and Grace had returned last\r\nnight. And I came in at once without troubling the servants, by the\r\nshortest way.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to Julian next. \xe2\x80\x9cThe woman you were speaking of\r\njust now,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9chas been here again already--in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet immediately looked at her nephew. Julian reassured her by a\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be some mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI am repeating what I have just\r\nheard from the lodge-keeper himself. He hesitated to mention it to Lady\r\nJanet for fear of alarming her. Only three days since this person had\r\nthe audacity to ask him for her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s address at the sea-side. Of\r\ncourse he refused to give it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear that, Julian?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet.\r\n\r\nNo signs of anger or mortification escaped Julian. The expression in his\r\nface at that moment was an expression of sincere distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t alarm yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his aunt, in his quietest tones.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she attempts to annoy you or Miss Roseberry again, I have it in my\r\npower to stop her instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we give her in charge to the police,\r\nwe shall become the subject of a public scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have managed to avoid all danger of scandal,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian answered; the\r\nexpression of distress in his face becoming more and more marked while\r\nhe spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I called here to-day I had a private consultation with\r\nthe magistrate of the district, and I have made certain arrangements at\r\nthe police station close by. On receipt of my card, an experienced man,\r\nin plain clothes, will present himself at any address that I indicate,\r\nand will take her quietly away. The magistrate will hear the charge in\r\nhis private room, and will examine the evidence which I can produce,\r\nshowing that she is not accountable for her actions. The proper medical\r\nofficer will report officially on the case, and the law will place her\r\nunder the necessary restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet and Horace looked at each other in amazement. Julian was,\r\nin their opinion, the last man on earth to take the course--at once\r\nsensible and severe--which Julian had actually adopted. Lady Janet\r\ninsisted on an explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I hear of this now for the first time?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you\r\nnot tell me you had taken these precautions before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian answered frankly and sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I hoped, aunt, that there would be no necessity for proceeding\r\nto extremities. You now force me to acknowledge that the lawyer and the\r\ndoctor (both of whom I have seen this morning) think, as you do, that\r\nshe is not to be trusted. It was at their suggestion entirely that\r\nI went to the magistrate. They put it to me whether the result of\r\nmy inquiries abroad--unsatisfactory as it may have been in other\r\nrespects--did not strengthen the conclusion that the poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nis deranged. I felt compelled in common honesty to admit that it was so.\r\nHaving owned this, I was bound to take such precautions as the lawyer\r\nand the doctor thought necessary. I have done my duty--sorely against my\r\nown will. It is weak of me, I dare say; but I can _not_ bear the\r\nthought of treating this afflicted creature harshly. Her delusion is so\r\nhopeless! her situation is such a pitiable one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice faltered. He turned away abruptly and took up his hat.\r\nLady Janet followed him, and spoke to him at the door. Horace smiled\r\nsatirically, and went to warm himself at the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going away, Julian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only going to the lodge-keeper. I want to give him a word of\r\nwarning in case of his seeing her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will come back here?\xe2\x80\x9d (Lady Janet lowered her voice to a whisper.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is really a reason, Julian, for your not leaving the house now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise not to go away, aunt, until I have provided for your\r\nsecurity. If you, or your adopted daughter, are alarmed by another\r\nintrusion, I give you my word of honor my card shall go to the police\r\nstation, however painfully I may feel it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d (He, too, lowered his\r\nvoice at the next words ) \xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, remember what I confessed\r\nto you while we were alone. For my sake, let me see as little of Miss\r\nRoseberry as possible. Shall I find you in this room when I come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid a strong emphasis, of look as well as of tone, on that one word.\r\nLady Janet understood what the emphasis meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cas much in love with Grace as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian laid one hand on his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and pointed with the other to\r\nHorace--standing with his back to them, warming his feet on the fender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian, with a smile on his lip and a tear in his eye, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever envied any man as I envy _him!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. A WOMAN\xe2\x80\x99S REMORSE.\r\n\r\nHAVING warmed his feet to his own entire satisfaction, Horace turned\r\nround from the fireplace, and discovered that he and Lady Janet were\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I see Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe easy tone in which he put the question--a tone, as it were, of\r\nproprietorship in \xe2\x80\x9cGrace\xe2\x80\x9d--jarred on Lady Janet at the moment. For\r\nthe first time in her life she found herself comparing Horace with\r\nJulian--to Horace\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage. He was rich; he was a gentleman of\r\nancient lineage; he bore an unblemished character. But who had the\r\nstrong brain? who had the great heart? Which was the Man of the two?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody can see her,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cNot even you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of the reply was sharp, with a dash of irony in it. But where\r\nis the modern young man, possessed of health and an independent income,\r\nwho is capable of understanding that irony can be presumptuous enough\r\nto address itself to _him?_ Horace (with perfect politeness) declined to\r\nconsider himself answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your ladyship mean that Miss Roseberry is in bed?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that Miss Roseberry is in her room. I mean that I have twice\r\ntried to persuade Miss Roseberry to dress and come downstairs, and tried\r\nin vain. I mean that what Miss Roseberry refuses to do for Me, she is\r\nnot likely to do for You--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow many more meanings of her own Lady Janet might have gone on\r\nenumerating, it is not easy to calculate. At her third sentence a sound\r\nin the library caught her ear through the incompletely closed door and\r\nsuspended the next words on her lips. Horace heard it also. It was the\r\nrustling sound (traveling nearer and nearer over the library carpet) of\r\na silken dress.\r\n\r\n(In the interval while a coming event remains in a state of uncertainty,\r\nwhat is it the inevitable tendency of every Englishman under thirty to\r\ndo? His inevitable tendency is to ask somebody to bet on the event.\r\nHe can no more resist it than he can resist lifting his stick or his\r\numbrella, in the absence of a gun, and pretending to shoot if a bird\r\nflies by him while he is out for a walk.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will your ladyship bet that this is not Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Horace.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship took no notice of the proposal; her attention remained\r\nfixed on the library door. The rustling sound stopped for a moment. The\r\ndoor was softly pushed open. The false Grace Roseberry entered the room.\r\n\r\nHorace advanced to meet her, opened his lips to speak, and\r\nstopped--struck dumb by the change in his affianced wife since he had\r\nseen her last. Some terrible oppression seemed to have crushed her. It\r\nwas as if she had actually shrunk in height as well as in substance. She\r\nwalked more slowly than usual; she spoke more rarely than usual, and in\r\na lower tone. To those who had seen her before the fatal visit of the\r\nstranger from Mannheim, it was the wreck of the woman that now appeared\r\ninstead of the woman herself. And yet there was the old charm still\r\nsurviving through it all; the grandeur of the head and eyes, the\r\ndelicate symmetry of the features, the unsought grace of every\r\nmovement--in a word, the unconquerable beauty which suffering cannot\r\ndestroy, and which time itself is powerless to wear out. Lady Janet\r\nadvanced, and took her with hearty kindness by both hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, welcome among us again! You have come down stairs to\r\nplease me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent her head in silent acknowledgment that it was so. Lady Janet\r\npointed to Horace: \xe2\x80\x9cHere is somebody who has been longing to see you,\r\nGrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe never looked up; she stood submissive, her eyes fixed on a little\r\nbasket of colored wools which hung on her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Horace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace placed her arm in his, and led her to the sofa. She shivered as\r\nshe took her seat, and looked round her. It was the first time she had\r\nseen the dining-room since the day when she had found herself face to\r\nface with the dead-alive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you come here, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cThe drawing-room\r\nwould have been a warmer and a pleasanter place for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw a carriage at the front door. I was afraid of meeting with\r\nvisitors in the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she made that reply, the servant came in, and announced the visitors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnames. Lady Janet sighed wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go and get rid of them,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, resigning herself to circumstances. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will _you_ do, Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will stay here, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will keep her company,\xe2\x80\x9d added Horace.\r\n\r\nLady Janet hesitated. She had promised to see her nephew in the\r\ndining-room on his return to the house--and to see him alone. Would\r\nthere be time enough to get rid of the visitors and to establish her\r\nadopted daughter in the empty drawing-room before Julian appeared? It\r\nwas ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk to the lodge, and he had to make the gate-keeper\r\nunderstand his instructions. Lady Janet decided that she had time enough\r\nat her disposal. She nodded kindly to Mercy, and left her alone with her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nHorace seated himself in the vacant place on the sofa. So far as it was\r\nin his nature to devote himself to any one he was devoted to Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam grieved to see how you have suffered,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with honest distress\r\nin his face as he looked at her. \xe2\x80\x9cTry to forget what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to forget. Do _you_ think of it much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, it is too contemptible to be thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe placed her work-basket on her lap. Her wasted fingers began absently\r\nsorting the wools inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Mr. Julian Gray?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does _he_ say about it?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at Horace for the first time,\r\nsteadily scrutinizing his face. Horace took refuge in prevarication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked for Julian\xe2\x80\x99s opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked down again, with a sigh, at the basket on her lap--considered\r\na little--and tried him once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy has Mr. Julian Gray not been here for a whole week?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants say he has been abroad. Is that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was useless to deny it. Horace admitted that the servants were right.\r\n\r\nHer fingers, suddenly stopped at their restless work among the wools;\r\nher breath quickened perceptibly. What had Julian Gray been doing\r\nabroad? Had he been making inquiries? Did he alone, of all the people\r\nwho saw that terrible meeting, suspect her? Yes! His was the finer\r\nintelligence; his was a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s (a London clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s) experience of\r\nfrauds and deceptions, and of the women who were guilty of them. Not a\r\ndoubt of it now! Julian suspected her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen does he come back?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in tones so low that Horace could\r\nbarely hear her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has come back already. He returned last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint shade of color stole slowly over the pallor of her face. She\r\nsuddenly put her basket away, and clasped her hands together to quiet\r\nthe trembling of them, before she asked her next question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is--\xe2\x80\x9d She paused to steady her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the person,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nresumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwho came here and frightened me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace hastened to re-assure her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe person will not come again,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk of her! Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something I want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did Mr. Julian Gray become acquainted with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was easily answered. Horace mentioned the consul at Mannheim, and\r\nthe letter of introduction. She listened eagerly, and said her next\r\nwords in a louder, firmer tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was quite a stranger, then, to Mr. Julian Gray--before that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite a stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace replied. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more questions--not another word\r\nabout her, Grace! I forbid the subject. Come, my own love!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ntaking her hand and bending over her tenderly, \xe2\x80\x9crally your spirits! We\r\nare young--we love each other--now is our time to be happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand turned suddenly cold, and trembled in his. Her head sank with a\r\nhelpless weariness on her breast. Horace rose in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are cold--you are faint,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me get you a glass of\r\nwine!--let me mend the fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe decanters were still on the luncheon-table. Horace insisted on\r\nher drinking some port-wine. She barely took half the contents of the\r\nwine-glass. Even that little told on her sensitive organization;\r\nit roused her sinking energies of body and mind. After watching her\r\nanxiously, without attracting her notice, Horace left her again to\r\nattend to the fire at the other end of the room. Her eyes followed\r\nhim slowly with a hard and tearless despair. \xe2\x80\x9cRally your spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated to herself in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cMy spirits! O God!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked round\r\nher at the luxury and beauty of the room, as those look who take their\r\nleave of familiar scenes. The moment after, her eyes sank, and rested on\r\nthe rich dress that she wore a gift from Lady Janet. She thought of the\r\npast; she thought of the future. Was the time near when she would be\r\nback again in the Refuge, or back again in the streets?--she who had\r\nbeen Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s adopted daughter, and Horace Holmcroft\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed\r\nwife! A sudden frenzy of recklessness seized on her as she thought of\r\nthe coming end. Horace was right! Why not rally her spirits? Why not\r\nmake the most of her time? The last hours of her life in that house\r\nwere at hand. Why not enjoy her stolen position while she could?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdventuress!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the mocking spirit within her, \xe2\x80\x9cbe true to your\r\ncharacter. Away with your remorse! Remorse is the luxury of an honest\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d She caught up her basket of wools, inspired by a new idea. \xe2\x80\x9cRing\r\nthe bell!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out to Horace at the fire-place.\r\n\r\nHe looked round in wonder. The sound of her voice was so completely\r\naltered that he almost fancied there must have been another woman in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRing the bell!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI have left my work upstairs. If you\r\nwant me to be in good spirits, I must have my work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill looking at her, Horace put his hand mechanically to the bell and\r\nrang. One of the men-servants came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo upstairs and ask my maid for my work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sharply. Even the\r\nman was taken by surprise: it was her habit to speak to the servants\r\nwith a gentleness and consideration which had long since won all their\r\nhearts. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, impatiently. The servant bowed,\r\nand went out on his errand. She turned to Horace with flashing eyes and\r\nfevered cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a comfort it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto belong to the upper classes! A\r\npoor woman has no maid to dress her, and no footman to send upstairs. Is\r\nlife worth having, Horace, on less than five thousand a year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant returned with a strip of embroidery. She took it with an\r\ninsolent grace, and told him to bring her a footstool. The man obeyed.\r\nShe tossed the embroidery away from her on the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cOn second\r\nthoughts, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about my work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it upstairs\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d The perfectly trained servant, marveling privately, obeyed once\r\nmore. Horace, in silent astonishment, advanced to the sofa to observe\r\nher more nearly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow grave you look!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with an air of\r\nflippant unconcern. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of my sitting idle, perhaps?\r\nAnything to please you! _I_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t got to go up and downstairs. Ring\r\nthe bell again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace remonstrated, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are quite mistaken.\r\nI never even thought of your work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; it\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent to send for my work, and then send it\r\naway again. Ring the bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace looked at her without moving. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has come to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me to\r\nrally my spirits? Will you ring the bell, or must I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace submitted. He frowned as he walked back to the bell. He was one\r\nof the many people who instinctively resent anything that is new to\r\nthem. This strange outbreak was quite new to him. For the first time\r\nin his life he felt sympathy for a servant, when the much-enduring man\r\nappeared once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring my work back; I have changed my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d With that brief\r\nexplanation she reclined luxuriously on the soft sofa-cushions, swinging\r\none of her balls of wool to and fro above her head, and looking at it\r\nlazily as she lay back. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a remark to make, Horace,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on,\r\nwhen the door had closed on her messenger. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only people in our\r\nrank of life who get good servants. Did you notice? Nothing upsets that\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s temper. A servant in a poor family should have been impudent; a\r\nmaid-of-all-work would have wondered when I was going to know my own\r\nmind.\xe2\x80\x9d The man returned with the embroidery. This time she received\r\nhim graciously; she dismissed him with her thanks. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen your\r\nmother lately, Horace?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, suddenly sitting up and busying\r\nherself with her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe understands, I hope, that I am not well enough to call on her? She\r\nis not offended with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace recovered his serenity. The deference to his mother implied in\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s questions gently flattered his self-esteem. He resumed his place\r\non the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOffended with you!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Grace, she sends you\r\nher love. And, more than that, she has a wedding present for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy became absorbed in her work; she stooped close over the\r\nembroidery--so close that Horace could not see her face. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know\r\nwhat the present is?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in lowered tones, speaking absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I only know it is waiting for you. Shall I go and get it to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe neither accepted nor refused the proposal--she went on with her work\r\nmore industriously than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is plenty of time,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cI can go before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill she took no notice: still she never looked up. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother is\r\nvery kind to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid, at one time, that\r\nshe would think me hardly good enough to be your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace laughed indulgently: his self-esteem was more gently flattered\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsurd!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, you are connected with Lady Janet\r\nRoy. Your family is almost as good as ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly almost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe momentary levity of expression vanished from Horace\xe2\x80\x99s face. The\r\nfamily question was far too serious a question to be lightly treated A\r\nbecoming shadow of solemnity stole over his manner. He looked as if it\r\nwas Sunday, and he was just stepping into church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn OUR family,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe trace back--by my father, to the Saxons;\r\nby my mother, to the Normans. Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s family is an old family--on\r\nher side only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy dropped her embroidery, and looked Horace full in the face. She,\r\ntoo, attached no common importance to what she had next to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had not been connected with Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you\r\never have thought of marrying me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love! what is the use of asking? You _are_ connected with Lady\r\nJanet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe refused to let him escape answering her in that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I had not been connected with Lady Janet?\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I had only been a good girl, with nothing but my own merits to\r\nspeak for me. What would your mother have said then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace still parried the question--only to find the point of it pressed\r\nhome on him once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask to be answered,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cWould your mother have liked you\r\nto marry a poor girl, of no family--with nothing but her own virtues to\r\nspeak for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace was fairly pressed back to the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you must know,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother would have refused to\r\nsanction such a marriage as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how good the girl might have been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something defiant--almost threatening--in her tone. Horace was\r\nannoyed--and he showed it when he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother would have respected the girl, without ceasing to respect\r\nherself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother would have remembered what was due to the\r\nfamily name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she would have said, No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would have said, No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an undertone of angry contempt in the exclamation which made\r\nHorace start. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, and took up her embroidery again. There he sat\r\nat her side, anxiously looking at her--his hope in the future centered\r\nin his marriage! In a week more, if she chose, she might enter that\r\nancient family of which he had spoken so proudly, as his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cif I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love him! if I had only his merciless mother to\r\nthink of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUneasily conscious of some estrangement between them, Horace spoke\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely I have not offended you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe turned toward him once more. The work dropped unheeded on her lap.\r\nHer grand eyes softened into tenderness. A smile trembled sadly on her\r\ndelicate lips. She laid one hand caressingly on his shoulder. All the\r\nbeauty of her voice lent its charm to the next words that she said to\r\nhim. The woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart hungered in its misery for the comfort that could\r\nonly come from his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ would have loved me, Horace--without stopping to think of the\r\nfamily name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe family name again! How strangely she persisted in coming back to\r\nthat! Horace looked at her without answering, trying vainly to fathom\r\nwhat was passing in her mind.\r\n\r\nShe took his hand, and wrung it hard--as if she would wring the answer\r\nout of him in that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ would have loved me?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nThe double spell of her voice and her touch was on him. He answered,\r\nwarmly, \xe2\x80\x9cUnder any circumstances! under any name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put one arm round his neck, and fixed her eyes on his. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that\r\ntrue?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue as t he heaven above us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drank in those few commonplace words with a greedy delight. She\r\nforced him to repeat them in a new form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter who I might have been? For myself alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor yourself alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw both arms round him, and laid her head passionately on his\r\nbreast. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you! I love you!! I love you!!!\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice rose with\r\nhysterical vehemence at each repetition of the words--then suddenly sank\r\nto a low hoarse cry of rage and despair. The sense of her true position\r\ntoward him revealed itself in all its horror as the confession of her\r\nlove escaped her lips. Her arms dropped from him; she flung herself back\r\non the sofa-cushions, hiding her face in her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmoaned, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cGo! go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace tried to wind his arm round her, and raise her. She started to\r\nher feet, and waved him back from her with a wild action of her hands,\r\nas if she was frightened of him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wedding present!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried,\r\nseizing the first pretext that occurred to her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou offered to bring me\r\nyour mother\xe2\x80\x99s present. I am dying to see what it is. Go and get it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace tried to compose her. He might as well have tried to compose the\r\nwinds and the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, pressing one clinched hand on her bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not\r\nwell. Talking excites me--I am hysterical; I shall be better alone. Get\r\nme the present. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I send Lady Janet? Shall I ring for your maid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend for nobody! ring for nobody! If you love me--leave me here by\r\nmyself! leave me instantly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you when I come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no alternative but to obey her. Unwillingly and forebodingly,\r\nHorace left the room.\r\n\r\nShe drew a deep breath of relief, and dropped into the nearest chair.\r\nIf Horace had stayed a moment longer--she felt it, she knew it--her\r\nhead would have given way; she would have burst out before him with\r\nthe terrible truth. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, pressing her cold hands on her\r\nburning eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cif I could only cry, now there is nobody to see me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room was empty: she had every reason for concluding that she was\r\nalone. And yet at that very moment there were ears that listened--there\r\nwere eyes waiting to see her.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the door behind her which faced the library and led\r\ninto the billiard-room was opened noiselessly from without, by an inch\r\nat a time. As the opening was enlarged a hand in a black glove, an\r\narm in a black sleeve, appeared, guiding the movement of the door. An\r\ninterval of a moment passed, and the worn white face of Grace Roseberry\r\nshowed itself stealthily, looking into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nHer eyes brightened with vindictive pleasure as they discovered Mercy\r\nsitting alone at the further end of the room. Inch by inch she opened\r\nthe door more widely, took one step forward, and checked herself. A\r\nsound, just audible at the far end of the conservatory, had caught her\r\near.\r\n\r\nShe listened--satisfied herself that she was not mistaken--and drawing\r\nback with a frown of displeasure, softly closed the door again, so as to\r\nhide herself from view. The sound that had disturbed her was the distant\r\nmurmur of men\xe2\x80\x99s voices (apparently two in number) talking together in\r\nlowered tones, at the garden entrance to the conservatory.\r\n\r\nWho were the men? and what would they do next? They might do one of two\r\nthings: they might enter the drawing-room, or they might withdraw again\r\nby way of the garden. Kneeling behind the door, with her ear at the\r\nkey-hole, Grace Roseberry waited the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. THEY MEET AGAIN.\r\n\r\nABSORBED in herself, Mercy failed to notice the opening door or to hear\r\nthe murmur of voices in the conservatory.\r\n\r\nThe one terrible necessity which had been present to her mind at\r\nintervals for a week past was confronting her at that moment. She owed\r\nto Grace Roseberry the tardy justice of owning the truth. The longer her\r\nconfession was delayed, the more cruelly she was injuring the woman whom\r\nshe had robbed of her identity--the friendless woman who had neither\r\nwitnesses nor papers to produce, who was powerless to right her own\r\nwrong. Keenly as she felt this, Mercy failed, nevertheless, to conquer\r\nthe horror that shook her when she thought of the impending avowal.\r\nDay followed day, and still she shrank from the unendurable ordeal of\r\nconfession--as she was shrinking from it now!\r\n\r\nWas it fear for herself that closed her lips?\r\n\r\nShe trembled--as any human being in her place must have trembled--at the\r\nbare idea of finding herself thrown back again on the world, which had\r\nno place in it and no hope in it for _her_. But she could have overcome\r\nthat terror--she could have resigned herself to that doom.\r\n\r\nNo! it was not the fear of the confession itself, or the fear of the\r\nconsequences which must follow it, that still held her silent. The\r\nhorror that daunted her was the horror of owning to Horace and to Lady\r\nJanet that she had cheated them out of their love.\r\n\r\nEvery day Lady Janet was kinder and kinder. Every day Horace was fonder\r\nand fonder of her. How could she confess to Lady Janet? how could she\r\nown to Horace that she had imposed upon him? \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. They are so\r\ngood to me--I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it!\xe2\x80\x9d In that hopeless way it had ended during the\r\nseven days that had gone by. In that hopeless way it ended again now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe murmur of the two voices at the further end of the conservatory\r\nceased. The billiard-room door opened again slowly, by an inch at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMercy still kept her place, unconscious of the events that were passing\r\nround her. Sinking under the hard stress laid on it, her mind had\r\ndrifted little by little into a new train of thought. For the first time\r\nshe found the courage to question the future in a new way. Supposing\r\nher confession to have been made, or supposing the woman whom she had\r\npersonated to have discovered the means of exposing the fraud, what\r\nadvantage, she now asked herself, would Miss Roseberry derive from Mercy\r\nMerrick\xe2\x80\x99s disgrace?\r\n\r\nCould Lady Janet transfer to the woman who was really her relative\r\nby marriage the affection which she had given to the woman who had\r\npretended to be her relative? No! All the right in the world would not\r\nput the true Grace into the false Grace\xe2\x80\x99s vacant place. The qualities\r\nby which Mercy had won Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s love were the qualities which were\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s won. Lady Janet could do rigid justice--but hers was not the\r\nheart to give itself to a stranger (and to give itself unreservedly) a\r\nsecond time. Grace Roseberry would be formally acknowledged--and there\r\nit would end.\r\n\r\nWas there hope in this new view?\r\n\r\nYes! There was the false hope of making the inevitable atonement by some\r\nother means than by the confession of the fraud.\r\n\r\nWhat had Grace Roseberry actually lost by the wrong done to her? She\r\nhad lost the salary of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompanion and reader.\xe2\x80\x9d Say that she\r\nwanted money, Mercy had her savings from the generous allowance made\r\nto her by Lady Janet; Mercy could offer money. Or say that she wanted\r\nemployment, Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s interest with Lady Janet could offer employment,\r\ncould offer anything Grace might ask for, if she would only come to\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nInvigorated by the new hope, Mercy rose excitedly, weary of inaction in\r\nthe empty room. She, who but a few minutes since had shuddered at the\r\nthought of their meeting again, was now eager to devise a means of\r\nfinding her way privately to an interview with Grace. It should be done\r\nwithout loss of time--on that very day, if possible; by the next day at\r\nlatest. She looked round her mechanically, pondering how to reach the\r\nend in view. Her eyes rested by chance on the door of the billiard-room.\r\n\r\nWas it fancy? or did she really see the door first open a little, then\r\nsuddenly and softly close again?\r\n\r\nWas it fancy? or did she really hear, at the same moment, a sound behind\r\nher as of persons speaking in the conservatory?\r\n\r\nShe paused; and, looking back in that direction, listened intently. The\r\nsound--if she had really heard it--was no longer audible. She advanced\r\ntoward the billiard-room to set her first doubt at rest. She stretched\r\nout her hand to open the door, when the voices (recognizable now as the\r\nvoices of two men) caught her ear once more.\r\n\r\nThis time she was able to distinguish the words that were spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny further orders, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired one of the men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other.\r\n\r\nMercy started, and faintly flushed, as the second voice answered the\r\nfirst. She stood irresolute close to the billiard-room, hesitating what\r\nto do next.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval the second voice made itself heard again, advancing\r\nnearer to the dining-room: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you there, aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d it asked cautiously.\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause. Then the voice spoke for the third time,\r\nsounding louder and nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you there?\xe2\x80\x9d it reiterated; \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nsomething to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy summoned her resolution and answered:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet is not here.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned as she spoke toward the\r\nconservatory door, and confronted on the threshold Julian Gray.\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another without exchanging a word on either side.\r\nThe situation--for widely different reasons--was equally embarrassing to\r\nboth of them.\r\n\r\nThere--as Julian saw _her_--was the woman forbidden to him, the woman\r\nwhom he loved.\r\n\r\nThere--as Mercy saw _him_--was the man whom she dreaded, the man whose\r\nactions (as she interpreted them) proved that he suspected her.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of it, the incidents which had marked their first meeting\r\nwere now exactly repeated, with the one difference that the impulse\r\nto withdraw this time appeared to be on the man\xe2\x80\x99s side and not on the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s. It was Mercy who spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you expect to find Lady Janet here?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, constrainedly. He\r\nanswered, on his part, more constrainedly still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother time will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew back as he made the reply. She advanced desperately, with the\r\ndeliberate intention of detaining him by speaking again.\r\n\r\nThe attempt which he had made to withdraw, the constraint in his\r\nmanner when he had answered, had instantly confirmed her in the false\r\nconviction that he, and he alone, had guessed the truth! If she was\r\nright--if he had secretly made discoveries abroad which placed her\r\nentirely at his mercy--the attempt to induce Grace to consent to a\r\ncompromise with her would be manifestly useless. Her first and foremost\r\ninterest now was to find out how she really stood in the estimation of\r\nJulian Gray. In a terror of suspense, that turned her cold from head to\r\nfoot, she stopped him on his way out, and spoke to him with the piteous\r\ncounterfeit of a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet is receiving some visitors,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will wait\r\nhere, she will be back directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effort of hiding her agitation from him had brought a passing color\r\ninto her cheeks. Worn and wasted as she was, the spell of her beauty was\r\nstrong enough to hold him against his own will. All he had to tell Lady\r\nJanet was that he had met one of the gardeners in the conservatory, and\r\nhad cautioned him as well as the lodge-keeper. It would have been easy\r\nto write this, and to send the note to his aunt on quitting the house.\r\nFor the sake of his own peace of mind, for the sake of his duty to\r\nHorace, he was doubly bound to make the first polite excuse that\r\noccurred to him, and to leave her as he had found her, alone in the\r\nroom. He made the attempt, and hesitated. Despising himself for doing\r\nit, he allowed himself to look at her. Their eyes met. Julian stepped\r\ninto the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am not in the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, confusedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI will wait, as you\r\nkindly propose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe noticed his embarrassment; she saw that he was strongly restraining\r\nhimself from looking at her again. Her own eyes dropped to the ground as\r\nshe made the discovery. Her speech failed her; her heart throbbed faster\r\nand faster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I look at him again\xe2\x80\x9d (was the thought in _her_ mind) \xe2\x80\x9cI shall fall\r\nat his feet and tell him all that I have done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I look at her again\xe2\x80\x9d (was the thought in _his_ mind) \xe2\x80\x9cI shall fall\r\nat her feet and own that I am in love with her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith downcast eyes he placed a chair for her. With downcast eyes she\r\nbowed to him and took it. A dead silence followed. Never was any human\r\nmisunderstanding more intricately complete than the misunderstanding\r\nwhich had now established itself between those two.\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s work-basket was near her. She took it, and gained time for\r\ncomposing herself by pretending to arrange the colored wools. He stood\r\nbehind her chair, looking at the graceful turn of her head, looking at\r\nthe rich masses of her hair. He reviled himself as the weakest of men,\r\nas the falsest of friends, for still remaining near her--and yet he\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nThe silence continued. The billiard-room door opened again noiselessly.\r\nThe face of the listening woman appeared stealthily behind it.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mercy roused herself and spoke: \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, softly, still not looking round at him, still busy with her\r\nbasket of wools.\r\n\r\nHe turned to get a chair--turned so quickly that he saw the\r\nbilliard-room door move, as Grace Roseberry closed it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any one in that room?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, addressing Mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I saw the door open and shut\r\nagain a little while ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advanced at once to look into the room. As he did so Mercy dropped\r\none of her balls of wool. He stopped to pick it up for her--then threw\r\nopen the door and looked into the billiard-room. It was empty.\r\n\r\nHad some person been listening, and had that person retreated in time\r\nto escape discovery? The open door of the smoking-room showed that room\r\nalso to be empty. A third door was open--the door of the side hall,\r\nleading into the grounds. Julian closed and locked it, and returned to\r\nthe dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mercy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the billiard-room door was\r\nnot properly shut, and that the draught of air from the hall must have\r\nmoved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe accepted the explanation in silence. He was, to all appearance, not\r\nquite satisfied with it himself. For a moment or two he looked about him\r\nuneasily. Then the old fascination fastened its hold on him again. Once\r\nmore he looked at the graceful turn of her head, at the rich masses of\r\nher hair. The courage to put the critical question to him, now that\r\nshe had lured him into remaining in the room, was still a courage that\r\nfailed her. She remained as busy as ever with her work--too busy to look\r\nat him; too busy to speak to him. The silence became unendurable. He\r\nbroke it by making a commonplace inquiry after her health. \xe2\x80\x9cI am well\r\nenough to be ashamed of the anxiety I have caused and the trouble I have\r\ngiven,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day I have got downstairs for the first\r\ntime. I am trying to do a little work.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked into the basket. The\r\nvarious specimens of wool in it were partly in balls and partly in loose\r\nskeins. The skeins were mixed and tangled. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is sad confusion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she exclaimed, timidly, with a faint smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to set it right\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me help you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a momentary return of the quaint humor which\r\nshe remembered so well. \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that I am a curate. Curates are\r\nprivileged to make themselves useful to young ladies. Let me try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a stool at her feet, and set himself to unravel one of the\r\ntangled skeins. In a minute the wool was stretched on his hands, and\r\nthe loose end was ready for Mercy to wind. There was something in the\r\ntrivial action, and in the homely attention that it implied, which in\r\nsome degree quieted her fear of him. She began to roll the wool off his\r\nhands into a ball. Thus occupied, she said the daring words which were\r\nto lead him little by little into betraying his suspicions, if he did\r\nindeed suspect the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. THE GUARDIAN ANGEL.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were here when I fainted, were you not?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy began. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nthink me a sad coward, even for a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI am far from thinking that,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\ncourage could have sustained the shock which fell on you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder\r\nthat you fainted. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder that you have been ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused in rolling up the ball of wool. What did those words of\r\nunexpected sympathy mean? Was he laying a trap for her? Urged by that\r\nserious doubt, she questioned him more boldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorace tells me you have been abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you enjoy your\r\nholiday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was no holiday. I went abroad because I thought it right to make\r\ncertain inquiries--\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped there, unwilling to return to a subject\r\nthat was painful to her.\r\n\r\nHer voice sank, her fingers trembled round the ball of wool; but she\r\nmanaged to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you arrive at any results?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt no results worth mentioning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe caution of that reply renewed her worst suspicions of him. In sheer\r\ndespair, she spoke out plainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know your opinion--\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently!\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are entangling the wool again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know your opinion of the person who so terribly frightened\r\nme. Do you think her--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I think her--what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think her an adventuress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(As she said those words the branches of a shrub in the conservatory\r\nwere noiselessly parted by a hand in a black glove. The face of Grace\r\nRoseberry appeared dimly behind the leaves. Undiscovered, she had\r\nescaped from the billiard-room, and had stolen her way into the\r\nconservatory as the safer hiding-place of the two. Behind the shrub she\r\ncould see as well as listen. Behind the shrub she waited as patiently as\r\never.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take a more merciful view,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe she is acting\r\nunder a delusion. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her: I pity her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pity her?\xe2\x80\x9d As Mercy repeated the words, she tore off Julian\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\nthe last few lengths of wool left, and threw the imperfectly wound skein\r\nback into the basket. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes that mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nbelieve her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian rose from his seat, and looked at Mercy in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Miss Roseberry! what put such an idea as that into your\r\nhead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am little better than a stranger to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, with an\r\neffort to assume a jesting tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou met that person before you met\r\nwith me. It is not so very far from pitying her to believing her. How\r\ncould I feel sure that you might not suspect me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspect _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you distress, how you\r\nshock me. Suspect _you!_ The bare idea of it never entered my mind. The\r\nman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live who trusts you more implicitly, who believes in you\r\nmore devotedly, than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes, his voice, his manner, all told her that those words came from\r\nthe heart. She contrasted his generous confidence in her (the confidence\r\nof which she was unworthy) with her ungracious distrust of him. Not only\r\nhad she wronged Grace Roseberry--she had wronged Julian Gray. Could she\r\ndeceive him as she had deceived the others? Could she meanly accept\r\nthat implicit trust, that devoted belief? Never had she felt the base\r\nsubmissions which her own imposture condemned her to undergo with a\r\nloathing of them so overwhelming as the loathing that she felt now. In\r\nhorror of herself, she turned her head aside in silence and shrank from\r\nmeeting his eye. He noticed the movement, placing his own interpretation\r\non it. Advancing closer, he asked anxiously if he had offended her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how your confidence touches me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, without\r\nlooking up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou little think how keenly I feel your kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe checked herself abruptly. Her fine tact warned her that she was\r\nspeaking too warmly--that the expression of her gratitude might strike\r\nhim as being strangely exaggerated. She handed him her work-basket\r\nbefore he could speak again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you put it away for me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in her quieter tones. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel able to work just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis back was turned on her for a moment, while he placed the basket on a\r\nside-table. In that moment her mind advanced at a bound from present to\r\nfuture. Accident might one day put the true Grace in possession of the\r\nproofs that she needed, and might reveal the false Grace to him in the\r\nidentity that was her own. What would he think of her then? Could she\r\nmake him tell her without betraying herself? She determined to try.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren are notoriously insatiable if you once answer their questions,\r\nand women are nearly as bad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when Julian returned to her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your patience hold out if I go back for the third time to the\r\nperson whom we have been speaking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you had _not_ taken your merciful view of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you believed that she was wickedly bent on deceiving others for\r\na purpose of her own--would you not shrink from such a woman in horror\r\nand disgust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid that I should shrink from any human creature!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered,\r\nearnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cWho among us has a right to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hardly dared trust herself to believe him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would still pity\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cand still feel for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how good you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held up his hand in warning. The tones of his voice deepened, the\r\nluster of his eyes brightened. She had stirred in the depths of that\r\ngreat heart the faith in which the man lived--the steady principle which\r\nguided his modest and noble life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that! Say that I try to love my neighbor as\r\nmyself. Who but a Pharisee can believe that he is better than another?\r\nThe best among us to-day may, but for the mercy of God, be the worst\r\namong us tomorrow. The true Christian virtue is the virtue which never\r\ndespairs of a fellow-creature. The true Christian faith believes in Man\r\nas well as in God. Frail and fallen as we are, we can rise on the wings\r\nof repentance from earth to heaven. Humanity is sacred. Humanity has its\r\nimmortal destiny. Who shall dare say to man or woman, \xe2\x80\x98There is no hope\r\nin you?\xe2\x80\x99 Who shall dare say the work is all vile, when that work bears\r\non it the stamp of the Creator\xe2\x80\x99s hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away for a moment, struggling with the emotion which she had\r\nroused in him.\r\n\r\nHer eyes, as they followed him, lighted with a momentary\r\nenthusiasm--then sank wearily in the vain regret which comes too late.\r\nAh! if he could have been her friend and her adviser on the fatal day\r\nwhen she first turned her steps toward Mablethorpe House! She sighed\r\nbitterly as the hopeless aspiration wrung her heart. He heard the sigh;\r\nand, turning again, looked at her with a new interest in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Roseberry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe was still absorbed in the bitter memories of the past: she failed to\r\nhear him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Roseberry,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, approaching her.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I venture to ask you something?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gently.\r\n\r\nShe shrank at the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I am speaking out of mere curiosity,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray don\xe2\x80\x99t answer me unless you can answer without betraying any\r\nconfidence which may have been placed in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfidence!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat confidence do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has just struck me that you might have felt more than a common\r\ninterest in the questions which you put to me a moment since,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cWere you by any chance speaking of some unhappy woman--not\r\nthe person who frightened you, of course--but of some other woman whom\r\nyou know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer head sank slowly on her bosom. He had plainly no suspicion that she\r\nhad been speaking of herself: his tone and manner both answered for it\r\nthat his belief in her was as strong as ever. Still those last words\r\nmade her tremble; she could not trust herself to reply to them.\r\n\r\nHe accepted the bending of her head as a reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you interested in her?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked next.\r\n\r\nShe faintly answered this time. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you encouraged her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not dared to encourage her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face lighted up suddenly with enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nlet me go with you and help you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer came faintly and mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has sunk too low for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe interrupted her with a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has she done?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has deceived--basely deceived--innocent people who trusted her. She\r\nhas wronged--cruelly wronged--another woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time Julian seated himself at her side. The interest that\r\nwas now roused in him was an interest above reproach. He could speak to\r\nMercy without restraint; he could look at Mercy with a pure heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou judge her very harshly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo _you_ know how she may have\r\nbeen tried and tempted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis the person whom she has injured still\r\nliving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the person is still living, she may atone for the wrong. The time\r\nmay come when this sinner, too, may win our pardon and deserve our\r\nrespect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould _you_ respect her?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy asked, sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cCan such a mind as yours\r\nunderstand what she has gone through?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA smile, kind and momentary, brightened his attentive face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget my melancholy experience,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung as I am, I\r\nhave seen more than most men of women who have sinned and suffered. Even\r\nafter the little that you have told me, I think I can put myself in\r\nher place. I can well understand, for instance, that she may have been\r\ntempted beyond human resistance. Am I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may have had nobody near at the time to advise her, to warn her, to\r\nsave her. Is that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTempted and friendless, self-abandoned to the evil impulse of the\r\nmoment, this woman may have committed herself headlong to the act which\r\nshe now vainly repents. She may long to make atonement, and may not\r\nknow how to begin. All her energies may be crushed under the despair and\r\nhorror of herself, out of which the truest repentance grows. Is such\r\na woman as this all wicked, all vile? I deny it! She may have a noble\r\nnature; and she may show it nobly yet. Give her the opportunity she\r\nneeds, and our poor fallen fellow-creature may take her place again\r\namong the best of us--honored, blameless, happy, once more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, resting eagerly on him while he was speaking, dropped\r\nagain despondingly when he had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such future as that,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the woman whom I\r\nam thinking of. She has lost her opportunity. She has done with hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian gravely considered with himself for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us understand each other,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has committed an act of\r\ndeception to the injury of another woman. Was that what you told me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she has gained something to her own advantage by the act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she threatened with discovery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is safe from discovery--for the present, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe as long as she closes her lips?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as she closes her lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is her opportunity!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cHer future is before her. She\r\nhas not done with hope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith clasped hands, in breathless suspense, Mercy looked at that\r\ninspiriting face, and listened to those golden words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her, through me, what she must do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her own the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Julian, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout the base fear of\r\ndiscovery to drive her to it. Let her do justice to the woman whom she\r\nhas wronged, while that woman is still powerless to expose her. Let her\r\nsacrifice everything that she has gained by the fraud to the sacred duty\r\nof atonement. If she can do that--for conscience\xe2\x80\x99 sake, and for pity\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake--to her own prejudice, to her own shame, to her own loss--then her\r\nrepentance has nobly revealed the noble nature that is in her; then she\r\nis a woman to be trusted, respected, beloved! If I saw the Pharisees and\r\nfanatics of this lower earth passing her by in contempt, I would hold\r\nout my hand to her before them all. I would say to her in her solitude\r\nand her affliction, \xe2\x80\x98Rise, poor wounded heart! Beautiful, purified soul,\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s angels rejoice over you! Take your place among the noblest of\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s creatures!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those last sentences he unconsciously repeated the language in which\r\nhe had spoken, years since, to his congregation in the chapel of the\r\nRefuge. With tenfold power and tenfold persuasion they now found their\r\nway again to Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s heart. Softly, suddenly, mysteriously, a change\r\npassed over her. Her troubled face grew beautifully still. The shifting\r\nlight of terror and suspense vanished from her grand gray eyes, and left\r\nin them the steady inner glow of a high and pure resolve.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence between them. They both had need of\r\nsilence. Julian was the first to speak again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I satisfied you that her opportunity is still before her?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel, as I feel, that she has _not_ done with hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have satisfied me that the world holds no truer friend to her than\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy answered, gently and gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cShe shall prove herself\r\nworthy of your generous confidence in her. She shall show you yet that\r\nyou have not spoken in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill inevitably failing to understand her, he led the way to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste the precious time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave her cruelly to\r\nherself. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t go to her, let me go as your messenger, in your\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped him by a gesture. He took a step back into the room, and\r\npaused, observing with surprise that she made no attempt to move from\r\nthe chair that she occupied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him, in suddenly altered tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand me directly. Give me a little time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe still lingered near the door, with his eyes fixed inquiringly on\r\nher. A man of a lower nature than his, or a man believing in Mercy less\r\ndevotedly than he believed, would now have felt his first suspicion of\r\nher. Julian was as far as ever from suspecting her, even yet. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nwish to be alone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, considerately. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I leave you for a\r\nwhile and return again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up with a start of terror. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, and\r\nsuddenly checked herself on the point of saying more. Nearly half the\r\nlength of the room divided them from each other. The words which she\r\nwas longing to say were words that would never pass her lips unless she\r\ncould see some encouragement in his face. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out to him, on\r\na sudden, in her sore need, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t leave me! Come back to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe obeyed her in silence. In silence, on her side, she pointed to the\r\nchair near her. He took it. She looked at him, and checked herself\r\nagain; resolute to make her terrible confession, yet still hesitating\r\nhow to begin. Her woman\xe2\x80\x99s instinct whispered to her, \xe2\x80\x9cFind courage in\r\nhis touch!\xe2\x80\x9d She said to him, simply and artlessly said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nme encouragement. Give me strength. Let me take your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d He neither\r\nanswered nor moved. His mind seemed to have become suddenly preoccupied;\r\nhis eyes rested on her vacantly. He was on the brink of discovering her\r\nsecret; in another instant he would have found his way to the truth. In\r\nthat instant, innocently as his sister might have taken it, she took\r\nhis hand. The soft clasp of her fingers, clinging round his, roused\r\nhis senses, fired his passion for her, swept out of his mind the pure\r\naspirations which had filled it but the moment before, paralyzed his\r\nperception when it was just penetrating the mystery of her disturbed\r\nmanner and her strange words. All the man in him trembled under the\r\nrapture of her touch. But the thought of Horace was still present to\r\nhim: his hand lay passive in hers; his eyes looked uneasily away from\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe innocently strengthened her clasp of his hand. She innocently said\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look away from me. Your eyes give me courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hand returned the pressure of hers. He tasted to the full the\r\ndelicious joy of looking at her. She had broken down his last reserves\r\nof self-control. The thought of Horace, the sense of honor, became\r\nobscured in him. In a moment more he might have said the words which he\r\nwould have deplored for the rest of his life, if she had not stopped him\r\nby speaking first. \xe2\x80\x9cI have more to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed abruptly,\r\nfeeling the animating resolution to lay her heart bare before him at\r\nlast; \xe2\x80\x9cmore, far more, than I have said yet. Generous, merciful friend,\r\nlet me say it _here!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe attempted to throw herself on her knees at his feet. He sprung from\r\nhis seat and checked her, holding her with both his hands, raising her\r\nas he rose himself. In the words which had just escaped her, in the\r\nstartling action which had accompanied them, the truth burst on him. The\r\nguilty woman she had spoken of was herself!\r\n\r\nWhile she was almost in his arms, while her bosom was just touching his,\r\nbefore a word more had passed his lips or hers, the library door opened.\r\n\r\nLady Janet Roy entered the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE SEARCH IN THE GROUNDS.\r\n\r\nGRACE ROSEBERRY, still listening in the conservatory, saw the door open,\r\nand recognized the mistress of the house. She softly drew back, and\r\nplaced herself in safer hiding, beyond the range of view from the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nLady Janet advanced no further than the threshold. She stood there and\r\nlooked at her nephew and her adopted daughter in stern silence.\r\n\r\nMercy dropped into the chair at her side. Julian kept his place by her.\r\nHis mind was still stunned by the discovery that had burst on it; his\r\neyes still rested on her in mute terror of inquiry. He was as completely\r\nabsorbed in the one act of looking at her as if they had been still\r\nalone together in the room.\r\n\r\nLady Janet was the first of the three who spoke. She addressed herself\r\nto her nephew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were right, Mr. Julian Gray,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with her bitterest emphasis\r\nof tone and manner. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have found nobody in this room on\r\nyour return but _me_. I detain you no longer. You are free to leave my\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian looked round at his aunt. She was pointing to the door. In the\r\nexcited state of his sensibilities at that moment the action stung him\r\nto the quick. He answered without his customary consideration for his\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s age and his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s position toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou apparently forget, Lady Janet, that you are not speaking to one of\r\nyour footmen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are serious reasons (of which you know\r\nnothing) for my remaining in your house a little longer. You may rely\r\nupon my trespassing on your hospitality as short a time as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned again to Mercy as he said those words, and surprised her\r\ntimidly looking up at him. In the instant when their eyes met, the\r\ntumult of emotions struggling in him became suddenly stilled. Sorrow for\r\nher--compassionating sorrow--rose in the new calm and filled his heart.\r\nNow, and now only, he could read in the wasted and noble face how she\r\nhad suffered. The pity which he had felt for the unnamed woman grew to\r\na tenfold pity for _her_. The faith which he professed--honestly\r\nprofessed--in the better nature of the unnamed woman strengthened into\r\na tenfold faith in _her_. He addressed himself again to his aunt, in a\r\ngentler tone. \xe2\x80\x9cThis lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9chas something to say to me in\r\nprivate which she has not said yet. That is my reason and my apology for\r\nnot immediately leaving the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill under the impression of what she had seen on entering the room,\r\nLady Janet looked at him in angry amazement. Was Julian actually\r\nignoring Horace Holmcroft\xe2\x80\x99s claims, in the presence of Horace\r\nHolmcroft\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed wife? She appealed to her adopted daughter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9chave you heard him? Have you nothing to say?\r\nMust I remind you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped. For the first time in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s experience of her young\r\ncompanion, she found herself speaking to ears that were deaf to her.\r\nMercy was incapable of listening. Julian\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had told her that Julian\r\nunderstood her at last!\r\n\r\nLady Janet turned to her nephew once more, and addressed him in the\r\nhardest words that she had ever spoken to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have any sense of decency,\xe2\x80\x9d she said--\xe2\x80\x9cI say nothing of a sense\r\nof honor--you will leave this house, and your acquaintance with that\r\nlady will end here. Spare me your protests and excuses; I can place but\r\none interpretation on what I saw when I opened that door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou entirely misunderstand what you saw when you opened that door,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Julian answered, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I misunderstand the confession which you made to me not an hour\r\nago?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Lady Janet.\r\n\r\nJulian cast a look of alarm at Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a\r\nwhisper. \xe2\x80\x9cShe might hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know you are in love with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, she has not the faintest suspicion of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the earnestness with which he made that reply.\r\nIt proved his innocence as nothing else could have proved it. Lady Janet\r\ndrew back a step--utterly bewildered; completely at a loss what to say\r\nor what to do next.\r\n\r\nThe silence that followed was broken by a knock at the library door. The\r\nman-servant--with news, and bad news, legibly written in his disturbed\r\nface and manner--entered the room. In the nervous irritability of the\r\nmoment, Lady Janet resented the servant\xe2\x80\x99s appearance as a positive\r\noffense on the part of the harmless man. \xe2\x80\x9cWho sent for you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\nsharply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by interrupting us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant made his excuses in an oddly bewildered manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon. I wished to take the liberty--I wanted to\r\nspeak to Mr. Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Julian.\r\n\r\nThe man looked uneasily at Lady Janet, hesitated, and glanced at the\r\ndoor, as if he wished himself well out of the room again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know if I can tell you, sir, before her ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nLady Janet instantly penetrated the secret of her servant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthat abominable woman has found\r\nher way here again. Am I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes helplessly consulted Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, or no?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Janet, imperatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian at once assumed the duty of asking the necessary questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere in the grounds, as we suppose, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid _you_ see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho saw her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lodge-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis looked serious. The lodge-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife had been present while\r\nJulian had given his instructions to her husband. She was not likely to\r\nhave mistaken the identity of the person whom she had discovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long since?\xe2\x80\x9d Julian asked next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very long, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe more particular. _How_ long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the lodge-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife speak to the person when she saw her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir: she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the chance, as I understand it. She is a stout\r\nwoman, if you remember. The other was too quick for her--discovered her,\r\nsir, and (as the saying is) gave her the slip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what part of the grounds did this happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant pointed in the direction of the side hall. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that part,\r\nsir. Either in the Dutch garden or the shrubbery. I am not sure which.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plain, by this time, that the man\xe2\x80\x99s information was too imperfect\r\nto be practically of any use. Julian asked if the lodge-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nwas in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. Her husband has gone out to search the grounds in her place,\r\nand she is minding the gate. They sent their boy with the message. From\r\nwhat I can make out from the lad, they would be thankful if they could\r\nget a word more of advice from you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian reflected for a moment.\r\n\r\nSo far as he could estimate them, the probabilities were that the\r\nstranger from Mannheim had already made her way into the house; that she\r\nhad been listening in the billiard-room; that she had found time enough\r\nto escape him on his approaching to open the door; and that she was now\r\n(in the servant\xe2\x80\x99s phrase) \xe2\x80\x9csomewhere in the grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d after eluding the\r\npursuit of the lodgekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nThe matter was serious. Any mistake in dealing with it might lead to\r\nvery painful results.\r\n\r\nIf Julian had correctly anticipated the nature of the confession which\r\nMercy had been on the point of addressing to him, the person whom he had\r\nbeen the means of introducing into the house was--what she had vainly\r\nasserted herself to be--no other than the true Grace Roseberry.\r\n\r\nTaking this for granted, it was of the utmost importance that he should\r\nspeak to Grace privately, before she committed herself to any rashly\r\nrenewed assertion of her claims, and before she could gain access to\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s adopted daughter. The landlady at her lodgings had already\r\nwarned him that the object which she held steadily in view was to find\r\nher way to \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x9d when Lady Janet was not present to take her\r\npart, and when no gentleman were at hand to protect her. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly let me\r\nmeet her face to face\xe2\x80\x9d (she had said), \xe2\x80\x9cand I will make her confess\r\nherself the impostor that she is!\xe2\x80\x9d As matters now stood, it was\r\nimpossible to estimate too seriously the mischief which might ensue from\r\nsuch a meeting as this. Everything now depended on Julian\xe2\x80\x99s skillful\r\nmanagement of an exasperated woman; and nobody, at that moment, knew\r\nwhere the woman was.\r\n\r\nIn this position of affairs, as Julian understood it, there seemed to be\r\nno other alternative than to make his inquiries instantly at the lodge\r\nand then to direct the search in person.\r\n\r\nHe looked toward Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s chair as he arrived at this resolution. It was\r\nat a cruel sacrifice of his own anxieties and his own wishes that he\r\ndeferred continuing the conversation with her from the critical point at\r\nwhich Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s appearance had interrupted it.\r\n\r\nMercy had risen while he had been questioning the servant. The attention\r\nwhich she had failed to accord to what had passed between his aunt and\r\nhimself she had given to the imperfect statement which he had extracted\r\nfrom the man. Her face plainly showed that she had listened as eagerly\r\nas Lady Janet had listened; with this remarkable difference between\r\nthere, that Lady Janet looked frightened, and that Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion showed no signs of alarm. She appeared to be interested;\r\nperhaps anxious--nothing more.\r\n\r\nJulian spoke a parting word to his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray compose yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x9cI have little doubt, when I can learn\r\nthe particulars, that we shall easily find this person in the grounds.\r\nThere is no reason to be uneasy. I am going to superintend the search\r\nmyself. I will return to you as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet listened absently. There was a certain expression in her eyes\r\nwhich suggested to Julian that her mind was busy with some project\r\nof its own. He stopped as he passed Mercy, on his way out by the\r\nbilliard-room door. It cost him a hard effort to control the contending\r\nemotions which the mere act of looking at her now awakened in him. His\r\nheart beat fast, his voice sank low, as he spoke to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see me again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never was more in earnest in\r\npromising you my truest help and sympathy than I am now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe understood him. Her bosom heaved painfully; her eyes fell to the\r\nground--she made no reply. The tears rose in Julian\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as he looked\r\nat her. He hurriedly left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned to close the billiard-room door, he heard Lady Janet say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be with you again in a moment, Grace; don\xe2\x80\x99t go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInterpreting these words as meaning that his aunt had some business\r\nof her own to attend to in the library, he shut the door. He had just\r\nadvanced into the smoking-room beyond, when he thought he heard the door\r\nopen again. He turned round. Lady Janet had followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want something of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour card.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy card?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have just told me not to be uneasy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI _am_\r\nuneasy, for all that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as sure as you do that this woman\r\nreally is in the grounds. She may be lurking somewhere in the house, and\r\nshe may appear when your back in turned. Remember what you told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian understood the allusion. He made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people at the police station close by,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Lady Janet, \xe2\x80\x9chave\r\ninstructions to send an experienced man, in plain clothes, to any\r\naddress indicated on your card the moment they receive it. That is what\r\nyou told me. For Grace\xe2\x80\x99s protection, I want your card before you leave\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Julian to mention the reasons which now forbade\r\nhim to make use of his own precautions--in the very face of the\r\nemergency which they had been especially intended to meet. How could he\r\ndeclare the true Grace Roseberry to be mad? How could he give the true\r\nGrace Roseberry into custody? On the other hand, he had personally\r\npledged himself (when the circumstances appeared to require it) to place\r\nthe means of legal protection from insult and annoyance at his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisposal. And now, there stood Lady Janet, unaccustomed to have her\r\nwishes disregarded by anybody, with her band extended, waiting for the\r\ncard!\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? The one way out of the difficulty appeared to be to\r\nsubmit for the moment. If he succeeded in discovering the missing woman,\r\nhe could easily take care that she should be subjected to no needless\r\nindignity. If she contrived to slip into the house in his absence,\r\nhe could provide against that contingency by sending a second card\r\nprivately to the police station, forbidding the officer to stir in the\r\naffair until he had received further orders. Julian made one stipulation\r\nonly before he handed his card to his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not use this, I am sure, without positive and pressing\r\nnecessity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must make one condition. Promise me to keep\r\nmy plan for communicating with the police a strict secret--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strict secret from Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Lady Janet. (Julian bowed.) \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou suppose I want to frighten her? Do you think I have not had anxiety\r\nenough about her already? Of course I shall keep it a secret from\r\nGrace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRe-assured on this point, Julian hastened out into the grounds. As soon\r\nas his back was turned Lady Janet lifted the gold pencil-case which hung\r\nat her watch-chain, and wrote on her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s card (for the information\r\nof the officer in plain clothes), \xe2\x80\x9c_You are wanted at Mablethorpe\r\nHouse_.\xe2\x80\x9d This done, she put the card into the old-fashioned pocket of\r\nher dress, and returned to the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrace was waiting, in obedience to the instructions which she had\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nFor the first moment or two not a word was spoken on either side. Now\r\nthat she was alone with her adopted daughter, a certain coldness and\r\nhardness began to show itself in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s manner. The discovery that\r\nshe had made on opening the drawing-room door still hung on her mind.\r\nJulian had certainly convinced her that she had misinterpreted what she\r\nhad seen; but he had convinced her against her will. She had found Mercy\r\ndeeply agitated; suspiciously silent. Julian might be innocent, she\r\nadmitted--there was no accounting for the vagaries of men. But the case\r\nof Mercy was altogether different. Women did not find themselves in the\r\narms of men without knowing what they were about. Acquitting Julian,\r\nLady Janet declined to acquit Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is some secret understanding\r\nbetween them,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old lady, \xe2\x80\x9cand she\xe2\x80\x99s to blame; the women\r\nalways are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy still waited to be spoken to; pale and quiet, silent and\r\nsubmissive. Lady Janet--in a highly uncertain state of temper--was\r\nobliged to begin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she called out, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much longer are you going to sit there with your mouth shut up and\r\nyour eyes on the carpet? Have you no opinion to offer on this alarming\r\nstate of things? You heard what the man said to Julian--I saw you\r\nlistening. Are you horribly frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even nervous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! I should hardly have given you credit for so much courage after my\r\nexperience of you a week ago. I congratulate you on your recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so composed as you are. We were an excitable set in _my_\r\nyouth--and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the better of it yet. I feel nervous. Do you\r\nhear? I feel nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good. Do you know what I am going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to summon the household. When I say the household, I mean\r\nthe men; the women are no use. I am afraid I fail to attract your\r\nattention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my best attention, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good again. I said the women were of no use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to place a man-servant on guard at every entrance to the house.\r\nI am going to do it at once. Will you come with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be of any use if I go with your ladyship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be of the slightest use. I give the orders in this house--not\r\nyou. I had quite another motive in asking you to come with me. I am more\r\nconsiderate of you than you seem to think--I don\xe2\x80\x99t like leaving you here\r\nby yourself. Do you understand?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to your ladyship. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being left here by\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind? I never heard of such heroism in my life--out of a\r\nnovel! Suppose that crazy wretch should find her way in here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would not frighten me this time as she frightened me before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot too fast, my young lady! Suppose--Good heavens! now I think of it,\r\nthere is the conservatory. Suppose she should be hidden in there? Julian\r\nis searching the grounds. Who is to search the conservatory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s permission, _I_ will search the conservatory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s permission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly believe my own ears! Well, \xe2\x80\x98Live and learn\xe2\x80\x99 is an old\r\nproverb. I thought I knew your character. This _is_ a change!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget, Lady Janet (if I may venture to say so), that the\r\ncircumstances are changed. She took me by surprise on the last occasion;\r\nI am prepared for her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really feel as coolly as you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave your own way, then. I shall do one thing, however, in case of your\r\nhaving overestimated your own courage. I shall place one of the men in\r\nthe library. You will only have to ring for him if anything happens. He\r\nwill give the alarm--and I shall act accordingly. I have my plan,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nher Ladyship, comfortably conscious of the card in her pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook as if you wanted to know what it is. I have no intention of saying\r\nanything about it--except that it will do. Once more, and for the last\r\ntime--do you stay here? or do you go with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe respectfully opened the library door for Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s departure as\r\nshe made that reply. Throughout the interview she had been carefully\r\nand coldly deferential; she had not once lifted her eyes to Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s face. The conviction in her that a few hours more would, in all\r\nprobability, see her dismissed from the house, had of necessity fettered\r\nevery word that she spoke--had morally separated her already from the\r\ninjured mistress whose love she had won in disguise. Utterly incapable\r\nof attributing the change in her young companion to the true motive,\r\nLady Janet left the room to summon her domestic garrison, thoroughly\r\npuzzled and (as a necessary consequence of that condition) thoroughly\r\ndispleased.\r\n\r\nStill holding the library door in her hand, Mercy stood watching with a\r\nheavy heart the progress of her benefactress down the length of the\r\nroom on the way to the front hall beyond. She had honestly loved and\r\nrespected the warm-hearted, quick-tempered old lady. A sharp pang of\r\npain wrung her as she thought of the time when even the chance utterance\r\nof her name would become an unpardonable offense in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nBut there was no shrinking in her now from the ordeal of the confession.\r\nShe was not only anxious--she was impatient for Julian\xe2\x80\x99s return. Before\r\nshe slept that night Julian\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in her should be a confidence\r\nthat she had deserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her own the truth, without the base fear of discovery to drive her\r\nto it. Let her do justice to the woman whom she has wronged, while that\r\nwoman is still powerless to expose her. Let her sacrifice everything\r\nthat she has gained by the fraud to the sacred duty of atonement. If\r\nshe can do that, then her repentance has nobly revealed the noble nature\r\nthat is in her; then she is a woman to be trusted, respected, beloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Those words were as vividly present to her as if she still heard them\r\nfalling from his lips. Those other words which had followed them rang\r\nas grandly as ever in her ears: \xe2\x80\x9cRise, poor wounded heart! Beautiful,\r\npurified soul, God\xe2\x80\x99s angels rejoice over you! Take your place among the\r\nnoblest of God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d Did the woman live who could hear Julian\r\nGray say that, and who could hesitate, at any sacrifice, at any loss, to\r\njustify his belief in her? \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, longingly while her eyes\r\nfollowed Lady Janet to the end of the library, \xe2\x80\x9cif your worst fears\r\ncould only be realized! If I could only see Grace Roseberry in this\r\nroom, how fearlessly I could meet her now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed the library door, while Lady Janet opened the other door\r\nwhich led into the hall.\r\n\r\nAs she turned and looked back into the dining-room a cry of astonishment\r\nescaped her.\r\n\r\nThere--as if in answer to the aspiration which was still in her mind;\r\nthere, established in triumph on the chair that she had just left--sat\r\nGrace Roseberry, in sinister silence, waiting for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. THE EVIL GENIUS.\r\n\r\nRECOVERING from the first overpowering sensation of surprise, Mercy\r\nrapidly advanced, eager to say her first penitent words. Grace stopped\r\nher by a warning gesture of the hand. \xe2\x80\x9cNo nearer to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with\r\na look of contemptuous command. \xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy paused. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s reception had startled her. She instinctively took\r\nthe chair nearest to her to support herself. Grace raised a warning hand\r\nfor the second time, and issued another command: \xe2\x80\x9cI forbid you to be\r\nseated in my presence. You have no right to be in this house at all.\r\nRemember, if you please, who you are, and who I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which those words were spoken was an insult in itself. Mercy\r\nsuddenly lifted her head; the angry answer was on her lips. She checked\r\nit, and submitted in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cI will be worthy of Julian Gray\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidence in me,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, as she stood patiently by the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill bear anything from the woman whom I have wronged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn silence the two faced each other; alone together, for the first time\r\nsince they had met in the French cottage. The contrast between them was\r\nstrange to see. Grace Roseberry, seated in her chair, little and lean,\r\nwith her dull white complexion, with her hard, threatening face, with\r\nher shrunken figure clad in its plain and poor black garments, looked\r\nlike a being of a lower sphere, compared with Mercy Merrick, standing\r\nerect in her rich silken dress; her tall, shapely figure towering\r\nover the little creature before her; her grand head bent in graceful\r\nsubmission; gentle, patient, beautiful; a woman whom it was a privilege\r\nto look at and a distinction to admire. If a stranger had been told that\r\nthose two had played their parts in a romance of real life--that one of\r\nthem was really connected by the ties of relationship with Lady Janet\r\nRoy, and that the other had successfully attempted to personate her--he\r\nwould inevitably, if it had been left to him to guess which was which,\r\nhave picked out Grace as the counterfeit and Mercy as the true woman.\r\n\r\nGrace broke the silence. She had waited to open her lips until she had\r\neyed her conquered victim all over, with disdainfully minute attention,\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand there. I like to look at you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking with a spiteful\r\nrelish of her own cruel words. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use fainting this time. You\r\nhave not got Lady Janet Roy to bring you to. There are no gentlemen here\r\nto-day to pity you and pick you up. Mercy Merrick, I have got you at\r\nlast. Thank God, my turn has come! You can\xe2\x80\x99t escape me now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the littleness of heart and mind which had first shown itself in\r\nGrace at the meeting in the cottage, when Mercy told the sad story of\r\nher life, now revealed itself once more. The woman who in those\r\npast times had felt no impulse to take a suffering and a penitent\r\nfellow-creature by the hand was the same woman who could feel no pity,\r\nwho could spare no insolence of triumph, now. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sweet voice\r\nanswered her patiently, in low, pleading tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not avoided you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have gone to you of my own\r\naccord if I had known that you were here. It is my heartfelt wish to\r\nown that I have sinned against you, and to make all the atonement that\r\nI can. I am too anxious to deserve your forgiveness to have any fear of\r\nseeing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConciliatory as the reply was, it was spoken with a simple and modest\r\ndignity of manner which roused Grace Roseberry to fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you speak to me as if you were any equal?\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nstand there and answer me as if you had your right and your place\r\nin this house. You audacious woman! _I_ have my right and my place\r\nhere--and what am I obliged to do? I am obliged to hang about in the\r\ngrounds, and fly from the sight of the servants, and hide like a thief,\r\nand wait like a beggar, and all for what? For the chance of having a\r\nword with _you_. Yes! you, madam! with the air of the Refuge and the\r\ndirt of the streets on you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s head sank lower; her hand trembled as it held by the back of the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to bear the reiterated insults heaped on her, but Julian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence still made itself felt. She answered as patiently as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is your pleasure to use hard words to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no\r\nright to resent them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no right to anything!\xe2\x80\x9d Grace retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no right\r\nto the gown on your back. Look at yourself, and look at Me!\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes\r\ntraveled with a tigerish stare over Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s costly silk dress. \xe2\x80\x9cWho gave\r\nyou that dress? who gave you those jewels? I know! Lady Janet gave them\r\nto Grace Roseberry. Are _you_ Grace Roseberry? That dress is mine. Take\r\noff your bracelets and your brooch. They were meant for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may soon have them, Miss Roseberry. They will not be in my\r\npossession many hours longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever badly you may use me, it is my duty to undo the harm that I\r\nhave done. I am bound to do you justice--I am determined to confess the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace smiled scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou confess!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I am fool enough to believe that?\r\nYou are one shameful brazen lie from head to foot! Are _you_ the woman\r\nto give up your silks and your jewels, and your position in this house,\r\nand to go back to the Refuge of your own accord? Not you--not you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA first faint flush of color showed itself, stealing slowly over Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface; but she still held resolutely by the good influence which Julian\r\nhad left behind him. She could still say to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cAnything rather\r\nthan disappoint Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d Sustained by the courage which _he_ had\r\ncalled to life in her, she submitted to her martyrdom as bravely as\r\never. But there was an ominous change in her now: she could only submit\r\nin silence; she could no longer trust herself to answer.\r\n\r\nThe mute endurance in her face additionally exasperated Grace Roseberry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ won\xe2\x80\x99t confess,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have had a week to confess in,\r\nand you have not done it yet. No, no! you are of the sort that cheat and\r\nlie to the last. I am glad of it; I shall have the joy of exposing you\r\nmyself before the whole house. I shall be the blessed means of casting\r\nyou back on the streets. Oh! it will be almost worth all I have gone\r\nthrough to see you with a policeman\xe2\x80\x99s hand on your arm, and the mob\r\npointing at you and mocking you on your way to jail!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time the sting struck deep; the outrage was beyond endurance. Mercy\r\ngave the woman who had again and again deliberately insulted her a first\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Roseberry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have borne without a murmur the bitterest\r\nwords you could say to me. Spare me any more insults. Indeed, indeed, I\r\nam eager to restore you to your just rights. With my whole heart I say\r\nit to you--I am resolved to confess everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with trembling earnestness of tone. Grace listened with a hard\r\nsmile of incredulity and a hard look of contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not far from the bell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cring it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy looked at her in speechless surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a perfect picture of repentance--you are dying to own the\r\ntruth,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the other, satirically. \xe2\x80\x9cOwn it before everybody,\r\nand own it at once. Call in Lady Janet--call in Mr. Gray and Mr.\r\nHolmcroft--call in the servants. Go down on your knees and acknowledge\r\nyourself an impostor before them all. Then I will believe you--not\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t turn me against you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mercy, entreatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care whether you are against me or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t--for your own sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t go on provoking me much longer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my own sake? You insolent creature! Do you mean to threaten me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a last desperate effort, her heart beating faster and faster, the\r\nblood burning hotter and hotter in her cheeks, Mercy still controlled\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some compassion on me!\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cBadly as I have behaved\r\nto you, I am still a woman like yourself. I can\xe2\x80\x99t face the shame of\r\nacknowledging what I have done before the whole house. Lady Janet treats\r\nme like a daughter; Mr. Holmcroft has engaged himself to marry me.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell Lady Janet and Mr. Holmcroft to their faces that I have\r\ncheated them out of their love. But they shall know it, for all that.\r\nI can, and will, before I rest to-night, tell the whole truth to Mr.\r\nJulian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a cynical outburst\r\nof gayety. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we have come to it at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Julian Gray! I was behind the billiard-room door--I saw you coax\r\nMr. Julian Gray to come in! confession loses all its horrors, and\r\nbecomes quite a luxury, with Mr. Julian Gray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more, Miss Roseberry! no more! For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t put me beside\r\nmyself! You have tortured me enough already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been on the streets for nothing. You are a woman with\r\nresources; you know the value of having two strings to your bow. If Mr.\r\nHolmcroft fails you, you have got Mr. Julian Gray. Ah! you sicken me.\r\n_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ see that Mr. Holmcroft\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are opened; he shall know what a\r\nwoman he might have married but for Me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe checked herself; the next refinement of insult remained suspended on\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\nThe woman whom she had outraged suddenly advanced on her. Her eyes,\r\nstaring helplessly upward, saw Mercy Merrick\xe2\x80\x99s face, white with the\r\nterrible anger which drives the blood back on the heart, bending\r\nthreateningly over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You will see that Mr. Holmcroft\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are opened,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy slowly\r\nrepeated; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98he shall know what a woman he might have married but for\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, and followed those words by a question which struck a\r\ncreeping terror through Grace Roseberry, from the hair of her head to\r\nthe soles of her feet:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Who are you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suppressed fury of look and tone which accompanied that question\r\ntold, as no violence could have told it, that the limits of Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nendurance had been found at last. In the guardian angel\xe2\x80\x99s absence the\r\nevil genius had done its evil work. The better nature which Julian\r\nGray had brought to life sank, poisoned by the vile venom of a womanly\r\nspiteful tongue. An easy and a terrible means of avenging the outrages\r\nheaped on her was within Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s reach, if she chose to take it. In the\r\nfrenzy of her indignation she never hesitated--she took it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked for the second time.\r\n\r\nGrace roused herself and attempted to speak. Mercy stopped her with a\r\nscornful gesture of her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, with the same fiercely suppressed rage. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare the madwoman from the German hospital who came here a week ago. I am\r\nnot afraid of you this time. Sit down and rest yourself, Mercy Merrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeliberately giving her that name to her face, Mercy turned from her\r\nand took the chair which Grace had forbidden her to occupy when the\r\ninterview began. Grace started to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mercy, contemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I recall every word\r\nI said to you just now. It means that I am resolved to keep my place in\r\nthis house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you out of your senses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not far from the bell. Ring it. Do what you asked _me_ to do.\r\nCall in the whole household, and ask them which of us is mad--you or I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy Merrick! you shall repent this to the last hour of your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy rose again, and fixed her flashing eyes on the woman who still\r\ndefied her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had enough of you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave the house while you can\r\nleave it. Stay here, and I will send for Lady Janet Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t send for her! You daren\xe2\x80\x99t send for her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can and I dare. You have not a shadow of a proof against me. I have\r\ngot the papers; I am in possession of the place; I have established\r\nmyself in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s confidence. I mean to deserve your opinion of\r\nme--I will keep my dresses and my jewels and my position in the house. I\r\ndeny that I have done wrong. Society has used me cruelly; I owe nothing\r\nto Society. I have a right to take any advantage of it if I can. I deny\r\nthat I have injured you. How was I to know that you would come to life\r\nagain? Have I degraded your name and your character? I have done honor\r\nto both. I have won everybody\xe2\x80\x99s liking and everybody\xe2\x80\x99s respect. Do you\r\nthink Lady Janet would have loved you as she loves me? Not she! I tell\r\nyou to your face I have filled the false position more creditably than\r\nyou could have filled the true one, and I mean to keep it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nup your name; I won\xe2\x80\x99t restore your character! Do your worst; I defy\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe poured out those reckless words in one headlong flow which defied\r\ninterruption. There was no answering her until she was too breathless\r\nto say more. Grace seized her opportunity the moment it was within her\r\nreach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou defy me?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, resolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t defy me long. I have\r\nwritten to Canada. My friends will speak for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it, if they do? Your friends are strangers here. I am Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s adopted daughter. Do you think she will believe your friends?\r\nShe will believe me. She will burn their letters if they write. She will\r\nforbid the house to them if they come. I shall be Mrs. Horace Holmcroft\r\nin a week\xe2\x80\x99s time. Who can shake _my_ position? Who can injure Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little. You forget the matron at the Refuge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind her, if you can. I never told you her name. I never told you where\r\nthe Refuge was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will advertise your name, and find the matron in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdvertise in every newspaper in London. Do you think I gave a stranger\r\nlike you the name I really bore in the Refuge? I gave you the name I\r\nassumed when I left England. No such person as Mercy Merrick is known to\r\nthe matron. No such person is known to Mr. Holmcroft. He saw me at the\r\nFrench cottage while you were senseless on the bed. I had my gray cloak\r\non; neither he nor any of them saw me in my nurse\xe2\x80\x99s dress. Inquiries\r\nhave been made about me on the Continent--and (I happen to know from\r\nthe person who made them) with no result. I am safe in your place; I\r\nam known by your name. I am Grace Roseberry; and you are Mercy Merrick.\r\nDisprove it, if you can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSumming up the unassailable security of her false position in those\r\nclosing words, Mercy pointed significantly to the billiard-room door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were hiding there, by your own confession,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nyour way out by that door. Will you leave the room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t stir a step!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy walked to a side-table, and struck the bell placed on it.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the billiard-room door opened. Julian Gray\r\nappeared--returning from his unsuccessful search in the grounds.\r\n\r\nHe had barely crossed the threshold before the library door was\r\nthrown open next by the servant posted in the room. The man drew back\r\nrespectfully, and gave admission to Lady Janet Roy. She was followed by\r\nHorace Holmcroft with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s wedding present to Mercy in his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. THE POLICEMAN IN PLAIN CLOTHES.\r\n\r\nJULIAN looked round the room, and stopped at the door which he had just\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nHis eyes rested first on Mercy, next on Grace.\r\n\r\nThe disturbed faces of both the women told him but too plainly that\r\nthe disaster which he had dreaded had actually happened. They had met\r\nwithout any third person to interfere between them. To what extremities\r\nthe hostile interview might have led it was impossible for him to guess.\r\nIn his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s presence he could only wait his opportunity of speaking to\r\nMercy, and be ready to interpose if anything was ignorantly done which\r\nmight give just cause of offense to Grace.\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s course of action on entering the dining-room was in perfect\r\nharmony with Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s character.\r\n\r\nInstantly discovering the intruder, she looked sharply at Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndid I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you frightened? No! not in the least\r\nfrightened! Wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to the servant. \xe2\x80\x9cWait in the library;\r\nI may want you again.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave it all to me; I can\r\nmanage it.\xe2\x80\x9d She made a sign to Horace. \xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are, and hold\r\nyour tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d Having now said all that was necessary to every one else,\r\nshe advanced to the part of the room in which Grace was standing, with\r\nlowering brows and firmly shut lips, defiant of everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no desire to offend you, or to act harshly toward you,\xe2\x80\x9d her\r\nladyship began, very quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI only suggest that your visits to my\r\nhouse cannot possibly lead to any satisfactory result. I hope you\r\nwill not oblige me to say any harder words than these--I hope you will\r\nunderstand that I wish you to withdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe order of dismissal could hardly have been issued with more humane\r\nconsideration for the supposed mental infirmity of the person to whom\r\nit was addressed. Grace instantly resisted it in the plainest possible\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn justice to my father\xe2\x80\x99s memory and in justice to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI insist on a hearing. I refuse to withdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ndeliberately took a chair and seated herself in the presence of the\r\nmistress of the house.\r\n\r\nLady Janet waited a moment--steadily controlling her temper. In the\r\ninterval of silence Julian seized the opportunity of remonstrating with\r\nGrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this what you promised me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave me your word\r\nthat you would not return to Mablethorpe House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he could say more Lady Janet had got her temper under command.\r\nShe began her answer to Grace by pointing with a peremptory forefinger\r\nto the library door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have not made up your mind to take my advice by the time I have\r\nwalked back to that door,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will put it out of your power\r\nto set me at defiance. I am used to be obeyed, and I will be obeyed. You\r\nforce me to use hard words. I warn you before it is too late. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned slowly toward the library. Julian attempted to interfere\r\nwith another word of remonstrance. His aunt stopped him by a gesture\r\nwhich said, plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cI insist on acting for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked next\r\nat Mercy. Would she remain passive? Yes. She never lifted her head;\r\nshe never moved from the place in which she was standing apart from the\r\nrest. Horace himself tried to attract her attention, and tried in vain.\r\n\r\nArrived at the library door, Lady Janet looked over her shoulder at the\r\nlittle immovable black figure in the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, for the last time.\r\n\r\nGrace started up angrily from her seat, and fixed her viperish eyes on\r\nMercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be turned out of your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s house in the presence of that\r\nimpostor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI may yield to force, but I will yield to nothing\r\nelse. I insist on my right to the place that she has stolen from me.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use scolding me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning doggedly to Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nlong as that woman is here under my name I can\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t keep away\r\nfrom the house. I warn her, in your presence, that I have written to\r\nmy friends in Canada! I dare her before you all to deny that she is the\r\noutcast and adventuress, Mercy Merrick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe challenge forced Mercy to take part in the proceedings in her own\r\ndefense. She had pledged herself to meet and defy Grace Roseberry on her\r\nown ground. She attempted to speak--Horace stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou degrade yourself if you answer her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my arm, and let\r\nus leave the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Take her out!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cShe may well be ashamed to face an\r\nhonest woman. It\xe2\x80\x99s her place to leave the room--not mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy drew her hand out of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI decline to leave the room,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, quietly.\r\n\r\nHorace still tried to persuade her to withdraw. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear\r\nyou insulted,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cThe woman offends me, though I know she is\r\nnot responsible for what she says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s endurance will be tried much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet. She\r\nglanced at Julian, and taking from her pocket the card which he had\r\ngiven to her, opened the library door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the police station,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the servant in an undertone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand give that card to the inspector on duty. Tell him there is not a\r\nmoment to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian, before his aunt could close the door again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Lady Janet, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI have given the man his orders.\r\nWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you send the card I wish to say a word in private to this lady,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Julian, indicating Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen that is done,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\napproaching Mercy, and pointedly addressing himself to her, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nhave a request to make--I shall ask you to give me an opportunity of\r\nspeaking to you without interruption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis tone pointed the allusion. Mercy shrank from looking at him. The\r\nsigns of painful agitation began to show themselves in her shifting\r\ncolor and her uneasy silence. Roused by Julian\xe2\x80\x99s significantly distant\r\nreference to what had passed between them, her better impulses were\r\nstruggling already to recover their influence over her. She might, at\r\nthat critical moment, have yielded to the promptings of her own nobler\r\nnature--she might have risen superior to the galling remembrance of the\r\ninsults that had been heaped upon her--if Grace\xe2\x80\x99s malice had not seen\r\nin her hesitation a means of referring offensively once again to her\r\ninterview with Julian Gray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t think twice about trusting him alone with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwith a sardonic affectation of politeness. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ am not interested in\r\nmaking a conquest of Mr. Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jealous distrust in Horace (already awakened by Julian\xe2\x80\x99s request)\r\nnow attempted to assert itself openly. Before he could speak, Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindignation had dictated Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you, Mr. Gray,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, addressing Julian (but\r\nstill not raising her eyes to his). \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing more to say. There\r\nis no need for me to trouble you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those rash words she recalled the confession to which she stood\r\npledged. In those rash words she committed herself to keeping the\r\nposition that she had usurped, in the face of the woman whom she had\r\ndeprived of it!\r\n\r\nHorace was silenced, but not satisfied. He saw Julian\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fixed in\r\nsad and searching attention on Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s face while she was speaking.\r\nHe heard Julian sigh to himself when she had done. He observed\r\nJulian--after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s serious consideration, and a moment\xe2\x80\x99s glance\r\nbackward at the stranger in the poor black clothes--lift his head with\r\nthe air of a man who had taken a sudden resolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me that card directly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the servant. His tone\r\nannounced that he was not to be trifled with. The man obeyed.\r\n\r\nWithout answering Lady Janet--who still peremptorily insisted on her\r\nright to act for herself--Julian took the pencil from his pocketbook and\r\nadded his signature to the writing already inscribed on the card. When\r\nhe had handed it back to the servant he made his apologies to his aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for venturing to interfere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a serious\r\nreason for what I have done, which I will explain to you at a fitter\r\ntime. In the meanwhile I offer no further obstruction to the course\r\nwhich you propose taking. On the contrary, I have just assisted you in\r\ngaining the end that you have in view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said that he held up the pencil with which he had signed his name.\r\n\r\nLady Janet, naturally perplexed, and (with some reason, perhaps)\r\noffended as well, made no answer. She waved her hand to the servant, and\r\nsent him away with the card.\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the room. The eyes of all the persons present\r\nturned more or less anxiously on Julian. Mercy was vaguely surprised and\r\nalarmed. Horace, like Lady Janet, felt offended, without clearly knowing\r\nwhy. Even Grace Roseberry herself was subdued by her own presentiment\r\nof some coming interference for which she was completely unprepared.\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s words and actions, from the moment when he had written on the\r\ncard, were involved in a mystery to which not one of the persons round\r\nhim held the clew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motive which had animated his conduct may, nevertheless, be\r\ndescribed in two words: Julian still held to his faith in the inbred\r\nnobility of Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s nature.\r\n\r\nHe had inferred, with little difficulty, from the language which Grace\r\nhad used toward Mercy in his presence, that the injured woman must have\r\ntaken pitiless advantage of her position at the interview which he had\r\ninterrupted. Instead of appealing to Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies and Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsense of right--instead of accepting the expression of her sincere\r\ncontrition, and encouraging her to make the completest and the speediest\r\natonement--Grace had evidently outraged and insulted her. As a necessary\r\nresult, her endurance had given way--under her own sense of intolerable\r\nseverity and intolerable wrong.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for the mischief thus done was, as Julian had first seen it,\r\nto speak privately with Grace, to soothe her by owning that his opinion\r\nof the justice of her claims had undergone a change in her favor, and\r\nthen to persuade her, in her own interests, to let him carry to Mercy\r\nsuch expressions of apology and regret as might lead to a friendly\r\nunderstanding between them.\r\n\r\nWith those motives, he had made his request to be permitted to speak\r\nseparately to the one and the other. The scene that had followed, the\r\nnew insult offered by Grace, and the answer which it had wrung\r\nfrom Mercy, had convinced him that no such interference as he had\r\ncontemplated would have the slightest prospect of success.\r\n\r\nThe only remedy now left to try was the desperate remedy of letting\r\nthings take their course, and trusting implicitly to Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\nnature for the result.\r\n\r\nLet her see the police officer in plain clothes enter the room. Let her\r\nunderstand clearly what the result of his interference would be. Let her\r\nconfront the alternative of consigning Grace Roseberry to a mad-house or\r\nof confessing the truth--and what would happen? If Julian\xe2\x80\x99s confidence\r\nin her was a confidence soundly placed, she would nobly pardon the\r\noutrages that had been heaped upon her, and she would do justice to the\r\nwoman whom she had wronged.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, his belief in her was nothing better than the\r\nblind belief of an infatuated man--if she faced the alternative and\r\npersisted in asserting her assumed identity--what then?\r\n\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s faith in Mercy refused to let that darker side of the question\r\nfind a place in his thoughts. It rested entirely with him to bring the\r\nofficer into the house. He had prevented Lady Janet from making any\r\nmischievous use of his card by sending to the police station and warning\r\nthem to attend to no message which they might receive unless the card\r\nproduced bore his signature. Knowing the responsibility that he was\r\ntaking on himself--knowing that Mercy had made no confession to him\r\nto which it was possible to appeal--he had signed his name without an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation: and there he stood now, looking at the woman whose\r\nbetter nature he was determined to vindicate, the only calm person in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy saw something suspiciously suggestive of a private\r\nunderstanding in Julian\xe2\x80\x99s earnest attention and in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s downcast\r\nface. Having no excuse for open interference, he made an effort to part\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Julian, \xe2\x80\x9cof wishing to say a word in\r\nprivate to that person.\xe2\x80\x9d (He pointed to Grace.) \xe2\x80\x9cShall we retire, or\r\nwill you take her into the library?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI refuse to have anything to say to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace burst out, before\r\nJulian could answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI happen to know that he is the last person to do\r\nme justice. He has been effectually hoodwinked. If I speak to anybody\r\nprivately, it ought to be to you. You have the greatest interest of any\r\nof them in finding out the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to marry an outcast from the streets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace took one step forward toward her. There was a look in his face\r\nwhich plainly betrayed that he was capable of turning her out of the\r\nhouse with his own hands. Lady Janet stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were right in suggesting just now that Grace had better leave the\r\nroom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us all three go. Julian will remain here and give\r\nthe man his directions when he arrives. Come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo. By a strange contradiction it was Horace himself who now interfered\r\nto prevent Mercy from leaving the room. In the heat of his indignation\r\nhe lost all sense of his own dignity; he descended to the level of a\r\nwoman whose intellect he believed to be deranged. To the surprise of\r\nevery one present, he stepped back and took from the table a jewel-case\r\nwhich he had placed there when he came into the room. It was the wedding\r\npresent from his mother which he had brought to his betrothed wife. His\r\noutraged self-esteem seized the opportunity of vindicating Mercy by a\r\npublic bestowal of the gift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat wretch shall have her answer. She\r\nhas sense enough to see and sense enough to hear. Let her see and hear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened the jewel-case, and took from it a magnificent pearl necklace\r\nin an antique setting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with his highest distinction of manner, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother\r\nsends you her love and her congratulations on our approaching marriage.\r\nShe begs you to accept, as part of your bridal dress, these pearls. She\r\nwas married in them herself. They have been in our family for centuries.\r\nAs one of the family, honored and beloved, my mother offers them to my\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lifted the necklace to clasp it round Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\nJulian watched her in breathless suspense. Would she sustain the ordeal\r\nthrough which Horace had innocently condemned her to pass?\r\n\r\nYes! In the insolent presence of Grace Roseberry, what was there now\r\nthat she could _not_ sustain? Her pride was in arms. Her lovely eyes\r\nlighted up as only a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes _can_ light up when they see jewelry.\r\nHer grand head bent gracefully to receive the necklace. Her face w\r\narmed into color; her beauty rallied its charms. Her triumph over\r\nGrace Roseberry was complete! Julian\xe2\x80\x99s head sank. For one sad moment he\r\nsecretly asked himself the question: \xe2\x80\x9cHave I been mistaken in her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace arrayed her in the pearls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband puts these pearls on your neck, love,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, proudly,\r\nand paused to look at her. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a contemptuous backward\r\nglance at Grace, \xe2\x80\x9cwe may go into the library. She has seen, and she has\r\nheard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe believed that he had silenced her. He had simply furnished her sharp\r\ntongue with a new sting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ will hear, and _you_ will see, when my proofs come from Canada,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will hear that your wife has stolen my name and my\r\ncharacter! You will see your wife dismissed from this house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy turned on her with an uncontrollable outburst of passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nLady Janet caught the electric infection of anger in the air of the\r\nroom. She, too, turned on Grace. She, too, said it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace followed Lady Janet. _He_ was beside himself. _He_ fixed his\r\npitiless eyes on Grace, and echoed the contagious words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silenced, she was daunted at last. The treble accusation\r\nrevealed to her, for the first time, the frightful suspicion to which\r\nshe had exposed herself. She shrank back with a low cry of horror, and\r\nstruck against a chair. She would have fallen if Julian had not sprung\r\nforward and caught her.\r\n\r\nLady Janet led the way into the library. She opened the\r\ndoor--started--and suddenly stepped aside, so as to leave the entrance\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nA man appeared in the open doorway.\r\n\r\nHe was not a gentleman; he was not a workman; he was not a servant. He\r\nwas vilely dressed, in glossy black broadcloth. His frockcoat hung on\r\nhim instead of fitting him. His waistcoat was too short and too tight\r\nover the chest. His trousers were a pair of shapeless black bags.\r\nHis gloves were too large for him. His highly-polished boots creaked\r\ndetestably whenever he moved. He had odiously watchful eyes--eyes that\r\nlooked skilled in peeping through key-holes. His large ears, set forward\r\nlike the ears of a monkey, pleaded guilty to meanly listening behind\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s doors. His manner was quietly confidential when he spoke,\r\nimpenetrably self-possessed when he was silent. A lurking air of secret\r\nservice enveloped the fellow, like an atmosphere of his own, from head\r\nto foot. He looked all round the magnificent room without betraying\r\neither surprise or admiration. He closely investigated every person in\r\nit with one glance of his cunningly watchful eyes. Making his bow to\r\nLady Janet, he silently showed her, as his introduction, the card that\r\nhad summoned him. And then he stood at ease, self-revealed in his own\r\nsinister identity--a police officer in plain clothes.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke to him. Everybody shrank inwardly as if a reptile had\r\ncrawled into the room.\r\n\r\nHe looked backward and forward, perfectly unembarrassed, between Julian\r\nand Horace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Julian Gray here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nJulian led Grace to a seat. Her eyes were fixed on the man. She\r\ntrembled--she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d Julian spoke to the police officer\r\nwithout answering her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to a chair in the most distant corner of\r\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x9cI will speak to you directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man advanced to the chair, marching to the discord of his creaking\r\nboots. He privately valued the carpet at so much a yard as he walked\r\nover it. He privately valued the chair at so much the dozen as he sat\r\ndown on it. He was quite at his ease: it was no matter to him whether he\r\nwaited and did nothing, or whether he pried into the private character\r\nof every one in the room, as long as he was paid for it.\r\n\r\nEven Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to act for herself was not proof against\r\nthe appearance of the policeman in plain clothes. She left it to her\r\nnephew to take the lead. Julian glanced at Mercy before he stirred\r\nfurther in the matter. He alone knew that the end rested now not with\r\nhim but with her.\r\n\r\nShe felt his eye on her while her own eyes were looking at the man. She\r\nturned her head--hesitated--and suddenly approached Julian. Like Grace\r\nRoseberry, she was trembling. Like Grace Roseberry, she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nis he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian told her plainly who he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you guess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace left Lady Janet, and joined Mercy and Julian--impatient of the\r\nprivate colloquy between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I in the way?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\nJulian drew back a little, understanding Horace perfectly. He looked\r\nround at Grace. Nearly the whole length of the spacious room divided\r\nthem from the place in which she was sitting. She had never moved\r\nsince he had placed her in a chair. The direst of all terrors was in\r\npossession of her--terror of the unknown. There was no fear of her\r\ninterfering, and no fear of her hearing what they said so long as\r\nthey were careful to speak in guarded tones. Julian set the example by\r\nlowering his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Horace why the police officer is here?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mercy.\r\n\r\nShe put the question directly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace looked across the room at Grace, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is here to\r\nrelieve us of that woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that he will take her away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will he take her to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the police station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy started, and looked at Julian. He was still watching the slightest\r\nchanges in her face. She looked back again at Horace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the police station!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask the question?\xe2\x80\x9d said Horace, irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be placed\r\nunder restraint, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean prison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean an asylum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Mercy turned to Julian. There was horror now, as well as surprise,\r\nin her face. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHorace is surely wrong? It can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian left it to Horace to answer. Every facility in him seemed to be\r\nstill absorbed in watching Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s face. She was compelled to address\r\nherself to Horace once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of asylum?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t surely mean a madhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cThe workhouse first, perhaps--and then the\r\nmadhouse. What is there to surprise you in that? You yourself told her\r\nto her face she was mad. Good Heavens! how pale you are! What is the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to Julian for the third time. The terrible alternative\r\nthat was offered to her had showed itself at last, without reserve or\r\ndisguise. Restore the identity that you have stolen, or shut her up in a\r\nmadhouse--it rests with you to choose! In that form the situation shaped\r\nitself in her mind. She chose on the instant. Before she opened her lips\r\nthe higher nature in her spoke to Julian, in her eyes. The steady\r\ninner light that he had seen in them once already shone in them again,\r\nbrighter and purer than before. The conscience that he had fortified,\r\nthe soul that he had saved, looked at him and said, Doubt us no more!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend that man out of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were her first words. She spoke (pointing to the police officer)\r\nin clear, ringing, resolute tones, audible in the remotest corner of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s hand stole unobserved to hers, and told her, in its momentary\r\npressure, to count on his brotherly sympathy and help. All the other\r\npersons in the room looked at her in speechless surprise. Grace rose\r\nfrom her chair. Even the man in plain clothes started to his feet. Lady\r\nJanet (hurriedly joining Horace, and fully sharing his perplexity and\r\nalarm) took Mercy impulsively by the arm, and shook it, as if to rouse\r\nher to a sense of what she was doing. Mercy held firm; Mercy resolutely\r\nrepeated what she had said: \xe2\x80\x9cSend that man out of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet lost all her patience with her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has come to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what you are saying? The man is here in\r\nyour interest, as well as in mine; the man is here to spare you, as\r\nwell as me, further annoyance and insult. And you insist--insist, in my\r\npresence--on his being sent away! What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know what it means, Lady Janet, in half an hour. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninsist--I only reiterate my entreaty. Let the man be sent away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian stepped aside (with his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s eyes angrily following him) and\r\nspoke to the police officer. \xe2\x80\x9cGo back to the station,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwait there till you hear from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe meanly vigilant eyes of the man in plain clothes traveled sidelong\r\nfrom Julian to Mercy, and valued her beauty as they had valued the\r\ncarpet and the chairs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old story,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe nice-looking\r\nwoman is always at the bottom of it; and, sooner or later, the\r\nnice-looking woman has her way.\xe2\x80\x9d He marched back across the room, to the\r\ndiscord of his own creaking boots, bowed, with a villainous smile which\r\nput the worst construction on everything, and vanished through the\r\nlibrary door.\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s high breeding restrained her from saying anything until the\r\npolice officer was out of hearing. Then, and not till then, she appealed\r\nto Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume you are in the secret of this?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have\r\nsome reason for setting my authority at defiance in my own house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never yet failed to respect your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore long you will know that I am not failing in respect toward you\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet looked across the room. Grace was listening eagerly,\r\nconscious that events had taken some mysterious turn in her favor within\r\nthe last minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it part of your new arrangement of my affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d her ladyship\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this person is to remain in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe terror that had daunted Grace had not lost all hold of her yet. She\r\nleft it to Julian to reply. Before he could speak Mercy crossed the room\r\nand whispered to her, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me time to confess it in writing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nown it before them--with this round my neck.\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed to the\r\nnecklace. Grace cast a threatening glance at her, and suddenly looked\r\naway again in silence.\r\n\r\nMercy answered Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your ladyship to permit her\r\nto remain until the half hour is over,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy request will have\r\nexplained itself by that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet raised no further obstacles. For something in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nor in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s tone, seemed to have silenced her, as it had silenced\r\nGrace. Horace was the next who spoke. In tones of suppressed rage\r\nand suspicion he addressed himself to Mercy, standing fronting him by\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I included,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cin the arrangement which engages you to\r\nexplain your extraordinary conduct in half an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_His_ hand had placed his mother\xe2\x80\x99s wedding present round Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s neck. A\r\nsharp pang wrung her as she looked at Horace, and saw how deeply she\r\nhad already distressed and offended him. The tears rose in her eyes; she\r\nhumbly and faintly answered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please,\xe2\x80\x9d was all she could say, before the cruel swelling at her\r\nheart rose and silenced her.\r\n\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s sense of injury refused to be soothed by such simple submission\r\nas this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dislike mysteries and innuendoes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, harshly. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my family\r\ncircle we are accustomed to meet each other frankly. Why am I to wait\r\nhalf an hour for an explanation which might be given now? What am I to\r\nwait for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet recovered herself as Horace spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entirely agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask, too, what are we to wait\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Julian\xe2\x80\x99s self-possession failed him when his aunt repeated that\r\ncruelly plain question. How would Mercy answer it? Would her courage\r\nstill hold out?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have asked me what you are to wait for,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Horace,\r\nquietly and firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cWait to hear something more of Mercy Merrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet listened with a look of weary disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t return to _that!_\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know enough about Mercy Merrick\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me--your ladyship does _not_ know. I am the only person who can\r\ninform you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent her head respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have begged you, Lady Janet, to give me half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn half an hour I solemnly engage myself to produce Mercy Merrick in\r\nthis room. Lady Janet Roy, Mr. Horace Holmcroft, you are to wait for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSteadily pledging herself in those terms to make her confession, she\r\nunclasped the pearls from her neck, put them away in their cases and\r\nplaced it in Horace\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a momentary\r\nfaltering in her voice, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil we meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace took the case in silence; he looked and acted like a man whose\r\nmind was paralyzed by surprise. His hand moved mechanically. His eyes\r\nfollowed Mercy with a vacant, questioning look. Lady Janet seemed, in\r\nher different way, to share the strange oppression that had fallen on\r\nhim. A vague sense of dread and distress hung like a cloud over her\r\nmind. At that memorable moment she felt her age, she looked her age, as\r\nshe had never felt it or looked it yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy, respectfully, \xe2\x80\x9cto go to my\r\nroom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet mutely granted the request. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s last look, before she\r\nwent out, was a look at Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you satisfied now?\xe2\x80\x9d the grand gray\r\neyes seemed to say, mournfully. Grace turned her head aside, with a\r\nquick, petulant action. Even her narrow nature opened for a moment\r\nunwillingly, and let pity in a little way, in spite of itself.\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s parting words recommended Grace to Julian\xe2\x80\x99s care:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see that she is allowed a room to wait in? You will warn her\r\nyourself when the half hour has expired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian opened the library door for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done! Nobly done!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cAll my sympathy is with you--all\r\nmy help is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes looked at him, and thanked him, through her gathering tears.\r\nHis own eyes were dimmed. She passed quietly down the room, and was lost\r\nto him before he had shut the door again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. THE FOOTSTEP IN THE CORRIDOR.\r\n\r\nMERCY was alone.\r\n\r\nShe had secured one half hour of retirement in her own room, designing\r\nto devote that interval to the writing of her confession, in the form of\r\na letter addressed to Julian Gray.\r\n\r\nNo recent change in her position had, as yet, mitigated her horror of\r\nacknowledging to Horace and to Lady Janet that she had won her way to\r\ntheir hearts in disguise. Through Julian only could she say the words\r\nwhich were to establish Grace Roseberry in her right position in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHow was her confession to be addressed to him? In writing? or by word of\r\nmouth?\r\n\r\nAfter all that had happened, from the time when Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance had interrupted them, she would have felt relief rather than\r\nembarrassment in personally opening her heart to the man who had so\r\ndelicately understood her, who had so faithfully befriended her in her\r\nsorest need. But the repeated betrayals of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s jealous suspicion\r\nof Julian warned her that she would only be surrounding herself with\r\nnew difficulties, and be placing Julian in a position of painful\r\nembarrassment, if she admitted him to a private interview while Horace\r\nwas in the house.\r\n\r\nThe one course left to take was the course that she had adopted.\r\nDetermining to address the narrative of the Fraud to Julian in the form\r\nof a letter, she arranged to add, at the close, certain instructions,\r\npointing out to him the line of conduct which she wished him to pursue.\r\n\r\nThese instructions contemplated the communication of her letter to Lady\r\nJanet and to Horace in the library, while Mercy--self-confessed as the\r\nmissing woman whom she had pledged herself to produce--awaited in the\r\nadjoining room whatever sentence it pleased them to pronounce on her.\r\nHer resolution not to screen herself behind Julian from any consequences\r\nwhich might follow the confession had taken root in her mind from the\r\nmoment when Horace had harshly asked her (and when Lady Janet had joined\r\nhim in asking) why she delayed her explanation, and what she was keeping\r\nthem waiting for. Out of the very pain which those questions inflicted,\r\nthe idea of waiting her sentence in her own person in one room, while\r\nher letter to Julian was speaking for her in another, had sprung\r\nto life. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them break my heart if they like,\xe2\x80\x9d she had thought to\r\nherself, in the self-abasement of that bitter moment; \xe2\x80\x9cit will be no\r\nmore than I have deserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe locked her door and opened her writing-desk. Knowing what she had to\r\ndo, she tried to collect herself and do it.\r\n\r\nThe effort was in vain. Those persons who study writing as an art\r\nare probably the only persons who can measure the vast distance which\r\nseparates a conception as it exists in the mind from the reduction\r\nof that conception to form and shape in words. The heavy stress of\r\nagitation that had been laid on Mercy for hours together had utterly\r\nunfitted her for the delicate and difficult process of arranging the\r\nevents of a narrative in their due sequence and their due proportion\r\ntoward each other. Again and again she tried to begin her letter, and\r\nagain and again she was baffled by the same hopeless confusion of ideas.\r\nShe gave up the struggle in despair.\r\n\r\nA sense of sinking at her heart, a weight of hysterical oppression on\r\nher bosom, warned her not to leave herself unoccupied, a prey to morbid\r\nself-investigation and imaginary alarms.\r\n\r\nShe turned instinctively, for a temporary employment of some kind, to\r\nthe consideration of her own future. Here there were no intricacies\r\nor entanglements. The prospect began and ended with her return to the\r\nRefuge, if the matron would receive her. She did no injustice to Julian\r\nGray; that great heart would feel for her, that kind hand would be\r\nheld out to her, she knew. But what would happen if she thoughtlessly\r\naccepted all that his sympathy might offer? Scandal would point to her\r\nbeauty and to his youth, and would place its own vile interpretation on\r\nthe purest friendship that could exist between them. And _he_ would\r\nbe the sufferer, for _he_ had a character--a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s character--to\r\nlose. No. For his sake, out of gratitude to _him_, the farewell to\r\nMablethorpe House must be also the farewell to Julian Gray.\r\n\r\nThe precious minutes were passing. She resolved to write to the matron\r\nand ask if she might hope to be forgiven and employed at the Refuge\r\nagain. Occupation over the letter that was easy to write might have its\r\nfortifying effect on her mind, and might pave the way for resuming\r\nthe letter that was hard to write. She waited a moment at the window,\r\nthinking of the past life to which she was soon to return, before she\r\ntook up the pen again.\r\n\r\nHer window looked eastward. The dusky glare of lighted London met her as\r\nher eyes rested on the sky. It seemed to beckon her back to the horror\r\nof the cruel streets--to point her way mockingly to the bridges over\r\nthe black river--to lure her to the top of the parapet, and the dreadful\r\nleap into God\xe2\x80\x99s arms, or into annihilation--who knew which?\r\n\r\nShe turned, shuddering, from the window. \xe2\x80\x9cWill it end in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked herself, \xe2\x80\x9cif the matron says No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began her letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MADAM--So long a time has passed since you heard from me that I\r\nalmost shrink from writing to you. I am afraid you have already given me\r\nup in your own mind as a hard-hearted, ungrateful woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been leading a false life; I have not been fit to write to you\r\nbefore to-day. Now, when I am doing what I can to atone to those whom I\r\nhave injured--now, when I repent with my whole heart--may I ask leave\r\nto return to the friend who has borne with me and helped me through many\r\nmiserable years? Oh, madam, do not cast me off! I have no one to turn to\r\nbut you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me own everything to you? Will you forgive me when you\r\nknow what I have done? Will you take me back into the Refuge, if you\r\nhave any employment for me by which I may earn my shelter and my bread?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the night comes I must leave the house from which I am now\r\nwriting. I have nowhere to go to. The little money, the few valuable\r\npossessions I have, must be left behind me: they have been obtained\r\nunder false pretenses; they are not mine. No more forlorn creature\r\nthan I am lives at this moment. You are a Christian woman. Not for my\r\nsake--for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake--pity me and take me back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a good nurse, as you know, and I am a quick worker with my needle.\r\nIn one way or the other can you not find occupation for me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could also teach, in a very unpretending way. But that is useless.\r\nWho would trust their children to a woman without a character? There is\r\nno hope for me in this direction. And yet I am so fond of children! I\r\nthink I could be, not happy again, perhaps, but content with my lot, if\r\nI could be associated with them in some way. Are there not charitable\r\nsocieties which are trying to help and protect destitute children\r\nwandering about the streets? I think of my own wretched childhood--and\r\noh! I should so like to be employed in saving other children from ending\r\nas I have ended. I could work, for such an object as that, from morning\r\nto night, and never feel weary. All my heart would be in it; and I\r\nshould have this advantage over happy and prosperous women--I should\r\nhave nothing else to think of. Surely they might trust me with the poor\r\nlittle starving wanderers of the streets--if you said a word for me?\r\nIf I am asking too much, please forgive me. I am so wretched, madam--so\r\nlonely and so weary of my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one thing more. My time here is very short. Will you\r\nplease reply to this letter (to say yes or no) by telegram?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name by which you know me is not the name by which I have been\r\nknown here. I must beg you to address the telegram to \xe2\x80\x98The Reverend\r\nJulian Gray, Mablethorpe House, Kensington.\xe2\x80\x99 He is here, and he will\r\nshow it to me. No words of mine can describe what I owe to him. He has\r\nnever despaired of me--he has saved me from myself. God bless and reward\r\nthe kindest, truest, best man I have ever known!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more to say, except to ask you to excuse this long letter,\r\nand to believe me your grateful servant, ----.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe signed and inclosed the letter, and wrote the address. Then, for\r\nthe first time, an obstacle which she ought to have seen before showed\r\nitself, standing straight in her way.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to forward her letter in the ordinary manner by post.\r\nIt must be taken to its destination by a private messenger. Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants had hitherto been, one and all, at her disposal. Could she\r\npresume to employ them on her own affairs, when she might be dismissed\r\nfrom the house, a disgraced woman, in half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time? Of the two\r\nalternatives it seemed better to take her chance, and present herself at\r\nthe Refuge without asking leave first.\r\n\r\nWhile she was still considering the question she was startled by a knock\r\nat her door. On opening it she admitted Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s maid, with a morsel\r\nof folded note-paper in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my lady, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, giving her the note. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy stopped her as she was about to leave the room. The appearance of\r\nthe maid suggested an inquiry to her. She asked if any of the servants\r\nwere likely to be going into town that afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss. One of the grooms is going on horseback, with a message to\r\nher ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s coach-maker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Refuge was close by the coach-maker\xe2\x80\x99s place of business. Under the\r\ncircumstances, Mercy was emboldened to make use of the man. It was a\r\npardonable liberty to employ his services now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you kindly give the groom that letter for me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will\r\nnot take him out of his way. He has only to deliver it--nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman willingly complied with the request. Left once more by\r\nherself, Mercy looked at the little note which had been placed in her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that her benefactress had employed this formal\r\nmethod of communicating with her when they were both in the house. What\r\ndid such a departure from established habits mean? Had she received her\r\nnotice of dismissal? Had Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s quick intelligence found its way\r\nalready to a suspicion of the truth? Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s nerves were unstrung. She\r\ntrembled pitiably as she opened the folded note.\r\n\r\nIt began without a form of address, and it ended without a signature.\r\nThus it ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must request you to delay for a little while the explanation which\r\nyou have promised me. At my age, painful surprises are very trying\r\nthings. I must have time to compose myself, before I can hear what you\r\nhave to say. You shall not be kept waiting longer than I can help. In\r\nthe meanwhile everything will go on as usual. My nephew Julian, and\r\nHorace Holmcroft, and the lady whom I found in the dining-room, will, by\r\nmy desire, remain in the house until I am able to meet them, and to meet\r\nyou, again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere the note ended. To what conclusion did it point?\r\n\r\nHad Lady Janet really guessed the truth? or had she only surmised that\r\nher adopted daughter was connected in some discreditable manner with\r\nthe mystery of \xe2\x80\x9cMercy Merrick\xe2\x80\x9d? The line in which she referred to the\r\nintruder in the dining-room as \xe2\x80\x9cthe lady\xe2\x80\x9d showed very remarkably that\r\nher opinions had undergone a change in that quarter. But was the\r\nphrase enough of itself to justify the inference that she had actually\r\nanticipated the nature of Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s confession? It was not easy to decide\r\nthat doubt at the moment--and it proved to be equally difficult to\r\nthrow any light on it at an aftertime. To the end of her life Lady Janet\r\nresolutely refused to communicate to any one the conclusions which she\r\nmight have privately formed, the griefs which she might have secretly\r\nstifled, on that memorable day.\r\n\r\nAmid much, however, which was beset with uncertainty, one thing at\r\nleast was clear. The time at Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s disposal in her own room had been\r\nindefinitely prolonged by Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s benefactress. Hours might pass before\r\nthe disclosure to which she stood committed would be expected from her.\r\nIn those hours she might surely compose her mind sufficiently to be able\r\nto write her letter of confession to Julian Gray.\r\n\r\nOnce more she placed the sheet of paper before her. Resting her head on\r\nher hand as she sat at the table, she tried to trace her way through\r\nthe labyrinth of the past, beginning with the day when she had met\r\nGrace Roseberry in the French cottage, and ending with the day which had\r\nbrought them face to face, for the second time, in the dining-room at\r\nMablethorpe House.\r\n\r\nThe chain of events began to unroll itself in her mind clearly, link by\r\nlink.\r\n\r\nShe remarked, as she pursued the retrospect, how strangely Chance, or\r\nFate, had paved the way for the act of personation, in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf they had met under ordinary circumstances, neither Mercy nor Grace\r\nwould have trusted each other with the confidences which had been\r\nexchanged between them. As the event had happened, they had come\r\ntogether, under those extraordinary circumstances of common trial and\r\ncommon peril, in a strange country, which would especially predispose\r\ntwo women of the same nation to open their hearts to each other. In\r\nno other way could Mercy have obtained at a first interview that fatal\r\nknowledge of Grace\xe2\x80\x99s position and Grace\xe2\x80\x99s affairs which had placed\r\ntemptation before her as the necessary consequence that followed the\r\nbursting of the German shell.\r\n\r\nAdvancing from this point through the succeeding series of events which\r\nhad so naturally and yet so strangely favored the perpetration of the\r\nfraud, Mercy reached the later period when Grace had followed her to\r\nEngland. Here again she remarked, in the second place, how Chance, or\r\nFate, had once more paved the way for that second meeting which had\r\nconfronted them with one another at Mablethorpe House.\r\n\r\nShe had, as she well remembered, attended at a certain assembly\r\n(convened by a charitable society) in the character of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrepresentative, at Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s own request. For that reason she had\r\nbeen absent from the house when Grace had entered it. If her return had\r\nbeen delayed by a few minutes only, Julian would have had time to take\r\nGrace out of the room, and the terrible meeting which had stretched\r\nMercy senseless on the floor would never have taken place. As the event\r\nhad happened, the period of her absence had been fatally shortened by\r\nwhat appeared at the time to be, the commonest possible occurrence. The\r\npersons assembled at the society\xe2\x80\x99s rooms had disagreed so seriously on\r\nthe business which had brought them together as to render it necessary\r\nto take the ordinary course of adjourning the proceedings to a future\r\nday. And Chance, or Fate, had so timed that adjournment as to bring\r\nMercy back into the dining-room exactly at the moment when Grace\r\nRoseberry insisted on being confronted with the woman who had taken her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nShe had never yet seen the circumstances in this sinister light. She was\r\nalone in her room, at a crisis in her life. She was worn and weakened by\r\nemotions which had shaken her to the soul.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she felt the enervating influences let loose on her, in\r\nher lonely position, by her new train of thought. Little by little her\r\nheart began to sink under the stealthy chill of superstitious dread.\r\nVaguely horrible presentiments throbbed in her with her pulses, flowed\r\nthrough her with her blood. Mystic oppressions of hidden disaster\r\nhovered over her in the atmosphere of the room. The cheerful\r\ncandle-light turned traitor to her and grew dim. Supernatural murmurs\r\ntrembled round the house in the moaning of the winter wind. She was\r\nafraid to look behind her. On a sudden she felt her own cold hands\r\ncovering her face, without knowing when she had lifted them to it, or\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nStill helpless, under the horror that held her, she suddenly heard\r\nfootsteps--a man\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps--in the corridor outside. At other times\r\nthe sound would have startled her: now it broke the spell. The footsteps\r\nsuggested life, companionship, human interposition--no matter of what\r\nsort. She mechanically took up her pen; she found herself beginning to\r\nremember her letter to Julian Gray.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the footsteps stopped outside her door. The man\r\nknocked.\r\n\r\nShe still felt shaken. She was hardly mistress of herself yet. A faint\r\ncry of alarm escaped her at the sound of the knock. Before it could be\r\nrepeated she had rallied her courage, and had opened the door.\r\n\r\nThe man in the corridor was Horace Holmcroft.\r\n\r\nHis ruddy complexion had turned pale. His hair (of which he was\r\nespecially careful at other times) was in disorder. The superficial\r\npolish of his manner was gone; the undisguised man, sullen, distrustful,\r\nirritated to the last degree of endurance, showed through. He looked at\r\nher with a watchfully suspicious eye; he spoke to her, without preface\r\nor apology, in a coldly angry voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you aware,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cof what is going on downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not left my room,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that Lady Janet has\r\ndeferred the explanation which I had promised to give her, and I know no\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas nobody told you what Lady Janet did after you left us? Has nobody\r\ntold you that she politely placed her own boudoir at the disposal of the\r\nvery woman whom she had ordered half an hour before to leave the house?\r\nDo you really not know that Mr. Julian Gray has himself conducted this\r\nsuddenly-honored guest to her place of retirement? and that I am left\r\nalone in the midst of these changes, contradictions, and mysteries--the\r\nonly person who is kept out in the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is surely needless to ask me these questions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy, gently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho could possibly have told me what was going on below stairs before\r\nyou knocked at my door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with an ironical affectation of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are strangely forgetful to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely your friend Mr.\r\nJulian Gray might have told you? I am astonished to hear that he has not\r\nhad his private interview yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, Horace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cThe proper\r\nperson to understand me is Julian Gray. I look to _him_ to account to\r\nme for the confidential relations which seem to have been established\r\nbetween you behind my back. He has avoided me thus far, but I shall find\r\nmy way to him yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis manner threatened more than his words expressed. In Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s nervous\r\ncondition at the moment, it suggested to her that he might attempt to\r\nfasten a quarrel on Julian Gray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are entirely mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are ungratefully\r\ndoubting your best and truest friend. I say nothing of myself. You will\r\nsoon discover why I patiently submit to suspicions which other women\r\nwould resent as an insult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me discover it at once. Now! Without wasting a moment more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere had hitherto been some little distance between them. Mercy had\r\nlistened, waiting on the threshold of her door; Horace had spoken,\r\nstanding against the opposite wall of the corridor. When he said his\r\nlast words he suddenly stepped forward, and (with something imperative\r\nin the gesture) laid his hand on her arm. The strong grasp of it almost\r\nhurt her. She struggled to release herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped her arm as suddenly as he had taken it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman who has grossly\r\noutraged and insulted you--whose only excuse is that she is mad--is\r\ndetained in the house at your desire, I might almost say at your\r\ncommand, when the police officer is waiting to take her away. I have a\r\nright to know what this means. I am engaged to marry you. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrust other people, you are bound to explain yourself to Me. I refuse\r\nto wait for Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s convenience. I insist (if you force me to say\r\nso)--I insist on knowing the real nature of your connection with\r\nthis affair. You have obliged me to follow you here; it is my only\r\nopportunity of speaking to you. You avoid me; you shut yourself up\r\nfrom me in your own room. I am not your husband yet--I have no right to\r\nfollow you in. But there are other rooms open to us. The library is at\r\nour disposal, and I will take care that we are not interrupted. I am now\r\ngoing there, and I have a last question to ask. You are to be my wife in\r\na week\xe2\x80\x99s time: will you take me into your confidence or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo hesitate was, in this case, literally to be lost. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sense\r\nof justice told her that Horace had claimed no more than his due. She\r\nanswered instantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will follow you to the library, Horace, in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer prompt and frank compliance with his wishes surprised and touched\r\nhim. He took her hand.\r\n\r\nShe had endured all that his angry sense of injury could say. His\r\ngratitude wounded her to the quick. The bitterest moment she had felt\r\nyet was the moment in which he raised her hand to his lips, and murmured\r\ntenderly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy own true Grace!\xe2\x80\x9d She could only sign to him to leave her,\r\nand hurry back into her own room.\r\n\r\nHer first feeling, when she found herself alone again, was\r\nwonder--wonder that it should never have occurred to her, until he had\r\nhimself suggested it, that her betrothed husband had the foremost right\r\nto her confession. Her horror at owning to either of them that she had\r\ncheated them out of their love had hitherto placed Horace and Lady Janet\r\non the same level. She now saw for the first time that there was no\r\ncomparison between the claims which they respectively had on her. She\r\nowned an allegiance to Horace to which Lady Janet could assert no right.\r\nCost her what it might to avow the truth to him with her own lips, the\r\ncruel sacrifice must be made.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation she put away her writing materials. It\r\namazed her that she should ever have thought of using Julian Gray as\r\nan interpreter between the man to whom she was betrothed and herself.\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy (she thought) must have made a strong impression on\r\nher indeed to blind her to a duty which was beyond all compromise, which\r\nadmitted of no dispute!\r\n\r\nShe had asked for five minutes of delay before she followed Horace. It\r\nwas too long a time.\r\n\r\nHer one chance of finding courage to crush him with the dreadful\r\nrevelation of who she really was, of what she had really done, was\r\nto plunge headlong into the disclosure without giving herself time to\r\nthink. The shame of it would overpower her if she gave herself time to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nShe turned to the door to follow him at once.\r\n\r\nEven at that terrible moment the most ineradicable of all a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstincts--the instinct of personal self-respect--brought her to a\r\npause. She had passed through more than one terrible trial since she had\r\ndressed to go downstairs. Remembering this, she stopped mechanically,\r\nretraced her steps, and looked at herself in the glass.\r\n\r\nThere was no motive of vanity in what she now did. The action was as\r\nunconscious as if she had buttoned an unfastened glove, or shaken out a\r\ncrumpled dress. Not the faintest idea crossed her mind of looking to see\r\nif her beauty might still plead for her, and of trying to set it off at\r\nits best.\r\n\r\nA momentary smile, the most weary, the most hopeless, that ever saddened\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s face, appeared in the reflection which her mirror gave her\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cHaggard, ghastly, old before my time!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! better so. He will feel it less--he will not regret me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that thought she went downstairs to meet him in the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. THE MAN IN THE DINING-ROOM.\r\n\r\nIN the great emergencies of life we feel, or we act, as our dispositions\r\nincline us. But we never think. Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s mind was a blank as she\r\ndescended the stairs. On her way down she was conscious of nothing but\r\nthe one headlong impulse to get to the library in the shortest possible\r\nspace of time. Arrived at the door, the impulse capriciously left her.\r\nShe stopped on the mat, wondering why she had hurried herself, with time\r\nto spare. Her heart sank; the fever of her excitement changed suddenly\r\nto a chill as she faced the closed door, and asked herself the question,\r\nDare I go in?\r\n\r\nHer own hand answered her. She lifted it to turn the handle of the lock.\r\nIt dropped again helplessly at her side.\r\n\r\nThe sense of her own irresolution wrung from her a low exclamation of\r\ndespair. Faint as it was, it had apparently not passed unheard. The door\r\nwas opened from within--and Horace stood before her.\r\n\r\nHe drew aside to let her pass into the room. But he never followed her\r\nin. He stood in the doorway, and spoke to her, keeping the door open\r\nwith his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind waiting here for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, in vacant surprise, doubting whether she had heard\r\nhim aright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not be for long,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI am far too anxious to hear\r\nwhat you have to tell me to submit to any needless delays. The truth is,\r\nI have had a message from Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(From Lady Janet! What could Lady Janet want with him, at a time when\r\nshe was bent on composing herself in the retirement of her own room?)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have said two messages,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first\r\nwas given to me on my way downstairs. Lady Janet wished to see me\r\nimmediately. I sent an excuse. A second message followed. Lady Janet\r\nwould accept no excuse. If I refused to go to her I should be merely\r\nobliging her to come to me. It is impossible to risk being interrupted\r\nin that way; my only alternative is to get the thing over as soon as\r\npossible. Do you mind waiting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. Have you any idea of what Lady Janet wants with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Whatever it is, she shall not keep me long away from you. You will\r\nbe quite alone here; I have warned the servants not to show any one in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n With those words he left her.\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s first sensation was a sensation of relief--soon lost in a\r\nfeeling of shame at the weakness which could welcome any temporary\r\nrelief in such a position as hers. The emotion thus roused merged,\r\nin its turn, into a sense of impatient regret. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmessage,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI might have known my fate by this\r\ntime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe slow minutes followed each other drearily. She paced to and fro in\r\nthe library, faster and faster, under the intolerable irritation, the\r\nmaddening uncertainty, of her own suspense. Ere long, even the spacious\r\nroom seemed to be too small for her. The sober monotony of the long\r\nbook-lined shelves oppressed and offended her. She threw open the door\r\nwhich led into the dining-room, and dashed in, eager for a change of\r\nobjects, athirst for more space and more air.\r\n\r\nAt the first step she checked herself; rooted to the spot, under a\r\nsudden revulsion of feeling which quieted her in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe room was only illuminated by the waning fire-light. A man was\r\nobscurely visible, seated on the sofa, with his elbows on his knees and\r\nhis head resting on his hands. He looked up as the open door let in\r\nthe light from the library lamps. The mellow glow reached his face and\r\nrevealed Julian Gray.\r\n\r\nMercy was standing with her back to the light; her face being\r\nnecessarily hidden in deep shadow. He recognized her by her figure, and\r\nby the attitude into which it unconsciously fell. That unsought grace,\r\nthat lithe long beauty of line, belonged to but one woman in the house.\r\nHe rose, and approached her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been wishing to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand hoping that accident\r\nmight bring about some such meeting as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe offered her a chair. Mercy hesitated before she took her seat. This\r\nwas their first meeting alone since Lady Janet had interrupted her at\r\nthe moment when she was about to confide to Julian the melancholy story\r\nof the past. Was he anxious to seize the opportunity of returning to\r\nher confession? The terms in which he had addressed her seemed to imply\r\nit. She put the question to him in plain words,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel the deepest interest in hearing all that you have still to\r\nconfide to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut anxious as I may be, I will not hurry\r\nyou. I will wait, if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I must own that I do wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cNot on my\r\naccount--but because my time is at the disposal of Horace Holmcroft. I\r\nexpect to see him in a few minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you give me those few minutes?\xe2\x80\x9d Julian asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI have something\r\non my side to say to you which I think you ought to know before you see\r\nany one--Horace himself included.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a certain depression of tone which was not associated\r\nwith her previous experience of him. His face looked prematurely old and\r\ncareworn in the red light of the fire. Something had plainly happened to\r\nsadden and to disappoint him since they had last met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI willingly offer you all the time that I have at my own command,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mercy replied. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes what you have to tell me relate to Lady Janet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave her no direct reply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have to tell you of Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cis soon told. So far as she is concerned you have\r\nnothing more to dread. Lady Janet knows all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven the heavy weight of oppression caused by the impending interview\r\nwith Horace failed to hold its place in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s mind when Julian\r\nanswered her in those words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into the lighted room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too terrible to\r\nhear you say that in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian followed her into the library. Her limbs trembled under her.\r\nShe dropped into a chair, and shrank under his great bright eyes, as he\r\nstood by her side looking sadly down on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet knows all!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, with her head on her breast, and\r\nthe tears falling slowly over her cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you told her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said nothing to Lady Janet or to any one. Your confidence is a\r\nsacred confidence to me, until you have spoken first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Lady Janet said anything to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word. She has looked at you with the vigilant eyes of love; she\r\nhas listened to you with the quick hearing of love--and she has found\r\nher own way to the truth. She will not speak of it to me--she will not\r\nspeak of it to any living creature. I only know now how dearly she loved\r\nyou. In spite of herself she clings to you still. Her life, poor soul,\r\nhas been a barren one; unworthy, miserably unworthy, of such a nature as\r\nhers. Her marriage was loveless and childless. She has had admirers, but\r\nnever, in the higher sense of the word, a friend. All the best years of\r\nher life have been wasted in the unsatisfied longing for something to\r\nlove. At the end of her life You have filled the void. Her heart has\r\nfound its youth again, through You. At her age--at any age--is such a\r\ntie as this to be rudely broken at the mere bidding of circumstances?\r\nNo! She will suffer anything, risk anything, forgive anything, rather\r\nthan own, even to herself, that she has been deceived in you. There is\r\nmore than her happiness at stake; there is pride, a noble pride, in such\r\nlove as hers, which will ignore the plainest discovery and deny the most\r\nunanswerable truth. I am firmly convinced--from my own knowledge of her\r\ncharacter, and from what I have observed in her to-day--that she will\r\nfind some excuse for refusing to hear your confession. And more than\r\nthat, I believe (if the exertion of her influence can do it) that she\r\nwill leave no means untried of preventing you from acknowledging\r\nyour true position here to any living creature. I take a serious\r\nresponsibility on myself in telling you this--and I don\xe2\x80\x99t shrink\r\nfrom it. You ought to know, and you shall know, what trials and what\r\ntemptations may yet lie before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused--leaving Mercy time to compose herself, if she wished to speak\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nShe felt that there was a necessity for her speaking to him. He was\r\nplainly not aware that Lady Janet had already written to her to defer\r\nher promised explanation. This circumstance was in itself a confirmation\r\nof the opinion which he had expressed. She ought to mention it to him;\r\nshe tried to mention it to him. But she was not equal to the effort.\r\nThe few simple words in which he had touched on the tie that bound Lady\r\nJanet to her had wrung her heart. Her tears choked her. She could only\r\nsign to him to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may wonder at my speaking so positively,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwith\r\nnothing better than my own conviction to justify me. I can only say\r\nthat I have watched Lady Janet too closely to feel any doubt. I saw the\r\nmoment in which the truth flashed on her, as plainly as I now see you.\r\nIt did not disclose itself gradually--it burst on her, as it burst on\r\nme. She suspected nothing--she was frankly indignant at your sudden\r\ninterference and your strange language--until the time came in which\r\nyou pledged yourself to produce Mercy Merrick. Then (and then only)\r\nthe truth broke on her mind, trebly revealed to her in your words, your\r\nvoice, and your look. Then (and then only) I saw a marked change come\r\nover her, and remain in her while she remained in the room. I dread to\r\nthink of what she may do in the first reckless despair of the discovery\r\nthat she has made. I distrust--though God knows I am not naturally a\r\nsuspicious man--the most apparently trifling events that are now taking\r\nplace about us. You have held nobly to your resolution to own the truth.\r\nPrepare yourself, before the evening is over, to be tried and tempted\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy lifted her head. Fear took the place of grief in her eyes, as they\r\nrested in startled inquiry on Julian\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it possible that temptation can come to me now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will leave it to events to answer that question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will\r\nnot have long to wait. In the meantime I have put you on your guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He stooped, and spoke his next words earnestly, close at her ear. \xe2\x80\x9cHold\r\nfast by the admirable courage which you have shown thus far,\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cSuffer anything rather than suffer the degradation of yourself. Be\r\nthe woman whom I once spoke of--the woman I still have in my mind--who\r\ncan nobly reveal the noble nature that is in her. And never forget\r\nthis--my faith in you is as firm as ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him proudly and gratefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am pledged to justify your faith in me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have put it\r\nout of my own power to yield. Horace has my promise that I will explain\r\neverything to him, in this room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Horace himself asked it of you?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9c_He_, at least, has\r\nno suspicion of the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorace has appealed to my duty to him as his betrothed wife,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has the first claim to my confidence--he resents my\r\nsilence, and he has a right to resent it. Terrible as it will be to open\r\n_his_ eyes to the truth, I must do it if he asks me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was looking at Julian while she spoke. The old longing to associate\r\nwith the hard trial of the confession the one man who had felt for her,\r\nand believed in her, revived under another form. If she could only\r\nknow, while she was saying the fatal words to Horace, that Julian was\r\nlistening too, she would be encouraged to meet the worst that could\r\nhappen! As the idea crossed her mind, she observed that Julian was\r\nlooking toward the door through which they had lately passed. In an\r\ninstant she saw the means to her end. Hardly waiting to hear the few\r\nkind expressions of sympathy and approval which he addressed to her, she\r\nhinted timidly at the proposal which she had now to make to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going back into the next room?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you object to it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t object. I want you to be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Horace has joined you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. After Horace has joined me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to see me when it is over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe summoned her resolution, and told him frankly what she had in her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to be near me while I am speaking to Horace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwill give me courage if I can feel that I am speaking to you as well as\r\nto him. I can count on _your_ sympathy--and sympathy is so precious to\r\nme now! Am I asking too much, if I ask you to leave the door unclosed\r\nwhen you go back to the dining-room? Think of the dreadful trial--to him\r\nas well as to me! I am only a woman; I am afraid I may sink under it, if\r\nI have no friend near me. And I have no friend but you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those simple words she tried her powers of persuasion on him for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\nBetween perplexity and distress Julian was, for the moment, at a loss\r\nhow to answer her. The love for Mercy which he dared not acknowledge was\r\nas vital a feeling in him as the faith in her which he had been free to\r\navow. To refuse anything that she asked of him in her sore need--and,\r\nmore even than that, to refuse to hear the confession which it had been\r\nher first impulse to make to _him_--these were cruel sacrifices to his\r\nsense of what was due to Horace and of what was due to himself. But\r\nshrink as he might, even from the appearance of deserting her, it was\r\nimpossible for him (except under a reserve which was almost equivalent\r\nto a denial) to grant her request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that I can do I will do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doors shall be left\r\nunclosed, and I will remain in the next room, on this condition,\r\nthat Horace knows of it as well as you. I should be unworthy of your\r\nconfidence in me if I consented to be a listener on any other terms. You\r\nunderstand that, I am sure, as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had never thought of her proposal to him in this light. Woman-like,\r\nshe had thought of nothing but the comfort of having him near her. She\r\nunderstood him now. A faint flush of shame rose on her pale cheeks as\r\nshe thanked him. He delicately relieved her from her embarrassment by\r\nputting a question which naturally occurred under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Horace all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he not here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been called away,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cby a message from Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reply more than astonished Julian; it seemed almost to alarm him. He\r\nreturned to Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s chair; he said to her, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorace himself told me that Lady Janet had insisted on seeing him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot long ago. He asked me to wait for him here while he went upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s face darkened ominously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis confirms my worst fears,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave _you_ had any\r\ncommunication with Lady Janet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy replied by showing him his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s note. He read it carefully\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I not tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she would find some excuse for\r\nrefusing to hear your confession? She begins by delaying it, simply to\r\ngain time for something else which she has it in her mind to do. When\r\ndid you receive this note? Soon after you went upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a quarter of an hour after, as well as I can guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what happened down here after you left us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorace told me that Lady Janet had offered Miss Roseberry the use of\r\nher boudoir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said that you had shown her the way to the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you what happened after that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must tell you. If I can do nothing more in this serious state\r\nof things, I can at least prevent your being taken by surprise. In\r\nthe first place, it is right you should know that I had a motive for\r\naccompanying Miss Roseberry to the boudoir. I was anxious (for your\r\nsake) to make some appeal to her better self--if she had any better\r\nself to address. I own I had doubts of my success--judging by what I\r\nhad already seen of her. My doubts were confirmed. In the ordinary\r\nintercourse of life I should merely have thought her a commonplace,\r\nuninteresting woman. Seeing her as I saw her while we were alone--in\r\nother words, penetrating below the surface--I have never, in all my sad\r\nexperience, met with such a hopelessly narrow, mean, and low nature as\r\nhers. Understanding, as she could not fail to do, what the sudden change\r\nin Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s behavior toward her really meant, her one idea was to\r\ntake the cruelest possible advantage of it. So far from feeling any\r\nconsideration for _you_, she was only additionally imbittered toward\r\nyou. She protested against your being permitted to claim the merit of\r\nplacing her in her right position here by your own voluntary avowal of\r\nthe truth. She insisted on publicly denouncing you, and on forcing Lady\r\nJanet to dismiss you, unheard, before the whole household! \xe2\x80\x98Now I can\r\nhave my revenge! At last Lady Janet is afraid of me!\xe2\x80\x99 Those were her own\r\nwords--I am almost ashamed to repeat them--those, on my honor, were\r\nher own words! Every possible humiliation to be heaped on you; no\r\nconsideration to be shown for Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s age and Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nposition; nothing, absolutely nothing, to be allowed to interfere with\r\nMiss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance and Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s triumph! There is this\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s shameless view of what is due to her, as stated by herself in\r\nthe plainest terms. I kept my temper; I did all I could to bring her to\r\na better frame of mind. I might as well have pleaded--I won\xe2\x80\x99t say with\r\na savage; savages are sometimes accessible to remonstrance, if you know\r\nhow to reach them--I might as well have pleaded with a hungry animal to\r\nabstain from eating while food was within its reach. I had just given up\r\nthe hopeless effort in disgust, when Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s maid appeared with a\r\nmessage for Miss Roseberry from her mistress: \xe2\x80\x98My lady\xe2\x80\x99s compliments,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, and she will be glad to see you at your earliest convenience, in\r\nher room.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother surprise! Grace Roseberry invited to an interview with Lady\r\nJanet! It would have been impossible to believe it, if Julian had not\r\nheard the invitation given with his own ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe instantly rose,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t keep her ladyship\r\nwaiting a moment,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98show me the way.\xe2\x80\x99 She signed to the maid\r\nto go out of the room first, and then turned round and spoke to me from\r\nthe door. I despair of describing the insolent exultation of her manner.\r\nI can only repeat her words: \xe2\x80\x98This is exactly what I wanted! I had\r\nintended to insist on seeing Lady Janet: she saves me the trouble. I am\r\ninfinitely obliged to her.\xe2\x80\x99 With that she nodded to me, and closed the\r\ndoor. I have not seen her, I have not heard of her, since. For all I\r\nknow, she may be still with my aunt, and Horace may have found her there\r\nwhen he entered the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can Lady Janet have to say to her?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy asked, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible even to guess. When you found me in the dining-room\r\nI was considering that very question. I cannot imagine that any neutral\r\nground can exist on which it is possible for Lady Janet and this woman\r\nto meet. In her present frame of mind she will in all probability insult\r\nLady Janet before she has been five minutes in the room. I own I am\r\ncompletely puzzled. The one conclusion I can arrive at is that the note\r\nwhich my aunt sent to you, the private interview with Miss Roseberry\r\nwhich has followed, and the summons to Horace which has succeeded in its\r\nturn, are all links in the same chain of events, and are all tending to\r\nthat renewed temptation against which I have already warned you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy held up her hand for silence. She looked toward the door that\r\nopened on the hall; had she heard a footstep outside? No. All was still.\r\nNot a sign yet of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would I not give to know what is going on\r\nupstairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will soon know it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible that our\r\npresent uncertainty can last much longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away, intending to go back to the room in which she had found\r\nhim. Looking at her situation from a man\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, he naturally\r\nassumed that the best service he could now render to Mercy would be to\r\nleave her to prepare herself for the interview with Horace. Before\r\nhe had taken three steps away from her she showed him the difference\r\nbetween the woman\xe2\x80\x99s point of view and the man\xe2\x80\x99s. The idea of considering\r\nbeforehand what she should say never entered her mind. In her horror of\r\nbeing left by herself at that critical moment, she forgot every other\r\nconsideration. Even the warning remembrance of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s jealous distrust\r\nof Julian passed away from her, for the moment, as completely as if it\r\nnever had a place in her memory. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwait here alone. Come back--come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose impulsively while she spoke, as if to follow him into the\r\ndining-room, if he persisted in leaving her.\r\n\r\nA momentary expression of doubt crossed Julian\xe2\x80\x99s face as he retraced his\r\nsteps and signed to her to be seated a gain. Could she be depended on\r\n(he asked himself) to sustain the coming test of her resolution, when\r\nshe had not courage enough to wait for events in a room by herself?\r\nJulian had yet to learn that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s courage rises with the greatness\r\nof the emergency. Ask her to accompany you through a field in which some\r\nharmless cattle happen to be grazing, and it is doubtful, in nine cases\r\nout of ten, if she will do it. Ask her, as one of the passengers in a\r\nship on fire, to help in setting an example of composure to the rest,\r\nand it is certain, in nine cases out of ten, that she will do it. As\r\nsoon as Julian had taken a chair near her, Mercy was calm again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of your resolution?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cas long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me by\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe talk between them dropped there. They sat together in silence, with\r\ntheir eyes fixed on the door, waiting for Horace to come in.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a few minutes their attention was attracted by\r\na sound outside in the grounds. A carriage of some sort was plainly\r\naudible approaching the house.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped; the bell rang; the front door was opened. Had a\r\nvisitor arrived? No voice could be heard making inquiries. No footsteps\r\nbut the servant\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps crossed the hall. Along pause followed,\r\nthe carriage remaining at the door. Instead of bringing some one to the\r\nhouse, it had apparently arrived to take some one away.\r\n\r\nThe next event was the return of the servant to the front door. They\r\nlistened again. Again no second footstep was audible. The door was\r\nclosed; the servant recrossed the hall; the carriage was driven away.\r\nJudging by sounds alone, no one had arrived at the house, and no one had\r\nleft the house.\r\n\r\nJulian looked at Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe silently shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf any person has gone away in the carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nperson can hardly have been a man, or we must have heard him in the\r\nhall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which her companion had just drawn from the noiseless\r\ndeparture of the supposed visitor raised a sudden doubt in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and inquire!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, eagerly.\r\n\r\nJulian left the room, and returned again, after a brief absence, with\r\nsigns of grave anxiety in his face and manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you I dreaded the most trifling events that were passing about\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn event, which is far from being trifling, has just\r\nhappened. The carriage which we heard approaching along the drive turns\r\nout to have been a cab sent for from the house. The person who has gone\r\naway in it--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs a woman, as you supposed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy rose excitedly from her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be Grace Roseberry?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ Grace Roseberry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she gone away alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone--after an interview with Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she go willingly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe herself sent the servant for the cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless to inquire. We shall soon know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey resumed their seats, waiting, as they had waited already, with\r\ntheir eyes on the library door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. LADY JANET AT BAY.\r\n\r\nTHE narrative leaves Julian and Mercy for a while, and, ascending to the\r\nupper regions of the house, follows the march of events in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe maid had delivered her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s note to Mercy, and had gone away\r\nagain on her second errand to Grace Roseberry in her boudoir. Lady Janet\r\nwas seated at her writing-table, waiting for the appearance of the woman\r\nwhom she had summoned to her presence. A single lamp diffused its mild\r\nlight over the books, pictures, and busts round her, leaving the further\r\nend of the room, in which the bed was placed, almost lost in obscurity.\r\nThe works of art were all portraits; the books were all presentation\r\ncopies from the authors. It was Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s fancy to associate her\r\nbedroom with memorials of the various persons whom she had known in the\r\nlong course of her life--all of them more or less distinguished, most of\r\nthem, by this time, gathered with the dead.\r\n\r\nShe sat near her writing-table, lying back in her easy-chair--the living\r\nrealization of the picture which Julian\xe2\x80\x99s description had drawn. Her\r\neyes were fixed on a photographic likeness of Mercy, which was so raised\r\nupon a little gilt easel as to enable her to contemplate it under the\r\nfull light of the lamp. The bright, mobile old face was strangely and\r\nsadly changed. The brow was fixed; the mouth was rigid; the whole face\r\nwould have been like a mask, molded in the hardest forms of passive\r\nresistance and suppressed rage, but for the light and life still thrown\r\nover it by the eyes. There was something unutterably touching in the\r\nkeen hungering tenderness of the look which they fixed on the portrait,\r\nintensified by an underlying expression of fond and patient reproach.\r\nThe danger which Julian so wisely dreaded was in the rest of the face;\r\nthe love which he had so truly described was in the eyes alone. _They_\r\nstill spoke of the cruelly profaned affection which had been the one\r\nimmeasurable joy, the one inexhaustible hope of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s closing\r\nlife. The brow expressed nothing but her obstinate determination to\r\nstand by the wreck of that joy, to rekindle the dead ashes of that hope.\r\nThe lips were only eloquent of her unflinching resolution to ignore the\r\nhateful present and to save the sacred past. \xe2\x80\x9cMy idol may be shattered,\r\nbut none of you shall know it. I stop the march of discovery; I\r\nextinguish the light of truth. I am deaf to your words; am blind to your\r\nproofs. At seventy years old, my idol is my life. It shall be my idol\r\nstill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silence in the bedroom was broken by a murmuring of women\xe2\x80\x99s voices\r\noutside the door.\r\n\r\nLady Janet instantly raised herself in the chair and snatched the\r\nphotograph off the easel. She laid the portrait face downward, among\r\nsome papers on the table, then abruptly changed her mind, and hid it\r\namong the thick folds of lace which clothed her neck and bosom. There\r\nwas a world of love in the action itself, and in the sudden softening of\r\nthe eyes which accompanied it. The next moment Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s mask was on.\r\nAny superficial observer who had seen her now would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\na hard woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by the maid. Grace Roseberry entered the room.\r\n\r\nShe advanced rapidly, with a defiant assurance in her manner, and a\r\nlofty carriage of her head. She sat down in the chair, to which Lady\r\nJanet silently pointed, with a thump; she returned Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s grave\r\nbow with a nod and a smile. Every movement and every look of the little,\r\nworn, white-faced, shabbily dressed woman expressed insolent triumph,\r\nand said, as if in words, \xe2\x80\x9cMy turn has come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to wait on your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, without giving Lady\r\nJanet an opportunity of speaking first. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I should have felt it\r\nmy duty to request an interview, if you had not sent your maid to invite\r\nme up here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have felt it your duty to request an interview?\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet\r\nrepeated, very quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which that one last word was spoken embarrassed Grace at\r\nthe outset. It established as great a distance between Lady Janet and\r\nherself as if she had been lifted in her chair and conveyed bodily to\r\nthe other end of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am surprised that your ladyship should not understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nstruggling to conceal her confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially after your kind offer\r\nof your own boudoir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet remained perfectly unmoved. \xe2\x80\x9cI do _not_ understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered, just as quietly as ever.\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s temper came to her assistance. She recovered the assurance which\r\nhad marked her first appearance on the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI must enter into particulars, in justice\r\nto myself. I can place but one interpretation on the extraordinary\r\nchange in your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s behavior to me downstairs. The conduct of that\r\nabominable woman has at last opened your eyes to the deception that has\r\nbeen practiced on you. For some reason of your own, however, you\r\nhave not yet chosen to recognize me openly. In this painful position\r\nsomething is due to my own self-respect. I cannot, and will not, permit\r\nMercy Merrick to claim the merit of restoring me to my proper place in\r\nthis house. After what I have suffered it is quite impossible for me to\r\nendure that. I should have requested an interview (if you had not sent\r\nfor me) for the express purpose of claiming this person\xe2\x80\x99s immediate\r\nexpulsion from the house. I claim it now as a proper concession to Me.\r\nWhatever you or Mr. Julian Gray may do, _I_ will not tamely permit her\r\nto exhibit herself as an interesting penitent. It is really a little too\r\nmuch to hear this brazen adventuress appoint her own time for explaining\r\nherself. It is too deliberately insulting to see her sail out of the\r\nroom--with a clergyman of the Church of England opening the door for\r\nher--as if she was laying me under an obligation! I can forgive much,\r\nLady Janet--including the terms in which you thought it decent to order\r\nme out of your house. I am quite willing to accept the offer of your\r\nboudoir, as the expression on your part of a better frame of mind. But\r\neven Christian Charity has its limits. The continued presence of that\r\nwretch under your roof is, you will permit me to remark, not only a\r\nmonument of your own weakness, but a perfectly insufferable insult to\r\nMe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere she stopped abruptly--not for want of words, but for want of a\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\nLady Janet was not even pretending to attend to her. Lady Janet, with a\r\ndeliberate rudeness entirely foreign to her usual habits, was composedly\r\nbusying herself in arranging the various papers scattered about the\r\ntable. Some she tied together with little morsels of string; some\r\nshe placed under paper-weights; some she deposited in the fantastic\r\npigeon-holes of a little Japanese cabinet--working with a placid\r\nenjoyment of her own orderly occupation, and perfectly unaware, to all\r\noutward appearance, that any second person was in the room. She looked\r\nup, with her papers in both hands, when Grace stopped, and said,\r\nquietly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in sending for me to treat me with studied\r\nrudeness?\xe2\x80\x9d Grace retorted, angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy purpose in sending for you is to say something as soon as you will\r\nallow me the opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impenetrable composure of that reply took Grace completely by\r\nsurprise. She had no retort ready. In sheer astonishment she waited\r\nsilently with her eyes riveted on the mistress of the house.\r\n\r\nLady Janet put down her papers, and settled herself comfortably in the\r\neasy-chair, preparatory to opening the interview on her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little that I have to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be said in a\r\nquestion. Am I right in supposing that you have no present employment,\r\nand that a little advance in money (delicately offered) would be very\r\nacceptable to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to insult me, Lady Janet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. I mean to ask you a question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour question is an insult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy question is a kindness, if you will only understand it as it is\r\nintended. I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain of your not understanding it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nhold you responsible for any one of the many breaches of good manners\r\nwhich you have committed since you have been in this room. I was\r\nhonestly anxious to be of some service to you, and you have repelled my\r\nadvances. I am sorry. Let us drop the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExpressing herself in the most perfect temper in those terms, Lady Janet\r\nresumed the arrangement of her papers, and became unconscious once more\r\nof the presence of any second person in the room.\r\n\r\nGrace opened her lips to reply with the utmost intemperance of an angry\r\nwoman, and thinking better of it, controlled herself. It was plainly\r\nuseless to take the violent way with Lady Janet Roy. Her age and her\r\nsocial position were enough of themselves to repel any violence. She\r\nevidently knew that, and trusted to it. Grace resolved to meet the enemy\r\non the neutral ground of politeness, as the most promising ground that\r\nshe could occupy under present circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have said anything hasty, I beg to apologize to your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she began. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask if your only object in sending for me was to\r\ninquire into my pecuniary affairs, with a view to assisting me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Janet, \xe2\x80\x9cwas my only object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had nothing to say to me on the subject of Mercy Merrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever. I am weary of hearing of Mercy Merrick. Have you any\r\nmore questions to ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have one more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to ask your ladyship whether you propose to recognize me in the\r\npresence of your household as the late Colonel Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already recognized you as a lady in embarrassed circumstances,\r\nwho has peculiar claims on my consideration and forbearance. If you wish\r\nme to repeat those words in the presence of the servants (absurd as it\r\nis), I am ready to comply with your request.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s temper began to get the better of her prudent resolutions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthis won\xe2\x80\x99t do. I must request you to express\r\nyourself plainly. You talk of my peculiar claims on your forbearance.\r\nWhat claims do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be painful to both of us if we enter into details,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nLady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t let us enter into details.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI insist on it, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t insist on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace was deaf to remonstrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask you in plain words,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you acknowledge that you\r\nhave been deceived by an adventuress who has personated me? Do you mean\r\nto restore me to my proper place in this house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet returned to the arrangement of her papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your ladyship refuse to listen to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet looked up from her papers as blandly as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _you_ persist in returning to your delusion,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\noblige _me_ to persist in returning to my papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is my delusion, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour delusion is expressed in the questions you have just put to me.\r\nYour delusion constitutes your peculiar claim on my forbearance. Nothing\r\nyou can say or do will shake my forbearance. When I first found you in\r\nthe dining-room, I acted most improperly; I lost my temper. I did worse;\r\nI was foolish enough and imprudent enough to send for a police officer.\r\nI owe you every possible atonement (afflicted as you are) for treating\r\nyou in that cruel manner. I offered you the use of my boudoir, as part\r\nof my atonement. I sent for you, in the hope that you would allow me to\r\nassist you, as part of my atonement. You may behave rudely to me, you\r\nmay speak in the most abusive terms of my adopted daughter; I will\r\nsubmit to anything, as part of my atonement. So long as you abstain from\r\nspeaking on one painful subject, I will listen to you with the greatest\r\npleasure. Whenever you return to that subject I shall return to my\r\npapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace looked at Lady Janet with an evil smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to understand your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are ashamed\r\nto acknowledge that you have been grossly imposed upon. Your only\r\nalternative, of course, is to ignore everything that has happened. Pray\r\ncount on _my_ forbearance. I am not at all offended--I am merely amused.\r\nIt is not every day that a lady of high rank exhibits herself in such a\r\nposition as yours to an obscure woman like me. Your humane consideration\r\nfor me dates, I presume, from the time when your adopted daughter set\r\nyou the example, by ordering the police officer out of the room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s composure was proof even against this assault on it. She\r\ngravely accepted Grace\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry as a question addressed to her in\r\nperfect good faith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cto find that my adopted\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s interference has exposed her to misrepresentation. She ought\r\nto have remonstrated with me privately before she interfered. But she\r\nhas one fault--she is too impulsive. I have never, in all my experience,\r\nmet with such a warm-hearted person as she is. Always too considerate\r\nof others; always too forgetful of herself! The mere appearance of the\r\npolice officer placed you in a situation to appeal to her compassion,\r\nand her impulses carried her away as usual. My fault! All my fault!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace changed her tone once more. She was quick enough to discern that\r\nLady Janet was a match for her with her own weapons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have had enough of this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time to be serious. Your\r\nadopted daughter (as you call her) is Mercy Merrick, and you know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet returned to her papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Grace Roseberry, whose name she has stolen, and you know _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet went on with her papers.\r\n\r\nGrace got up from her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept your silence, Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cas an acknowledgment\r\nof your deliberate resolution to suppress the truth. You are evidently\r\ndetermined to receive the adventuress as the true woman; and you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nscruple to face the consequences of that proceeding, by pretending to my\r\nface to believe that I am mad. I will not allow myself to be impudently\r\ncheated out of my rights in this way. You will hear from me again madam,\r\nwhen the Canadian mail arrives in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked toward the door. This time Lady Janet answered, as readily\r\nand as explicitly as it was possible to desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall refuse to receive your letters,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nGrace returned a few steps, threateningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy letters shall be followed by my witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall refuse to receive your witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRefuse at your peril. I will appeal to the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to much knowledge of the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nshould be surprised indeed if I discovered that you had any claim on me\r\nwhich the law could enforce. However, let us suppose that you _can_ set\r\nthe law in action. You know as well as I do that the only motive power\r\nwhich can do that is--money. I am rich; fees, costs, and all the rest of\r\nit are matters of no sort of consequence to me. May I ask if you are in\r\nthe same position?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question silenced Grace. So far as money was concerned, she was\r\nliterally at the end of her resources. Her only friends were friends in\r\nCanada. After what she had said to him in the boudoir, it would be quite\r\nuseless to appeal to the sympathies of Julian Gray. In the pecuniary\r\nsense, and in one word, she was absolutely incapable of gratifying\r\nher own vindictive longings. And there sat the mistress of Mablethorpe\r\nHouse, perfectly well aware of it.\r\n\r\nLady Janet pointed to the empty chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you sit down again?\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cThe course of our\r\ninterview seems to have brought us back to the question that I asked\r\nyou when you came into my room. Instead of threatening me with the law,\r\nsuppose you consider the propriety of permitting me to be of some use to\r\nyou. I am in the habit of assisting ladies in embarrassed circumstances,\r\nand nobody knows of it but my steward--who keeps the accounts--and\r\nmyself. Once more, let me inquire if a little advance of the pecuniary\r\nsort (delicately offered) would be acceptable to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace returned slowly to the chair that she had left. She stood by it,\r\nwith one hand grasping the top rail, and with her eyes fixed in mocking\r\nscrutiny on Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last your ladyship shows your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHush-money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ send me back to my papers,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Lady Janet. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nobstinate you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s hand closed tighter and tighter round the rail of the chair.\r\nWithout witnesses, without means, without so much as a refuge--thanks to\r\nher own coarse cruelties of language and conduct--in the sympathies\r\nof others, the sense of her isolation and her helplessness was almost\r\nmaddening at that final moment. A woman of finer sensibilities would\r\nhave instantly left the room. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s impenetrably hard and narrow mind\r\nimpelled her to meet the emergency in a very different way. A last base\r\nvengeance, to which Lady Janet had voluntarily exposed herself, was\r\nstill within her reach. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the present,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is but\r\none way of being even with your ladyship. I can cost you as much as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray make some allowances for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not obstinate--I am\r\nonly a little awkward at matching the audacity of a lady of high rank.\r\nI shall improve with practice. My own language is, as I am painfully\r\naware, only plain English. Permit me to withdraw it, and to substitute\r\nyours. What advance is your ladyship (delicately) prepared to offer me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet opened a drawer, and took out her check-book.\r\n\r\nThe moment of relief had come at last! The only question now left to\r\ndiscuss was evidently the question of amount. Lady Janet considered a\r\nlittle. The question of amount was (to her mind) in some sort a question\r\nof conscience as well. Her love for Mercy and her loathing for Grace,\r\nher horror of seeing her darling degraded and her affection profaned\r\nby a public exposure, had hurried her--there was no disputing it--into\r\ntreating an injured woman harshly. Hateful as Grace Roseberry might be,\r\nher father had left her, in his last moments, with Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s full\r\nconcurrence, to Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s care. But for Mercy she would have been\r\nreceived at Mablethorpe House as Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s companion, with a salary\r\nof one hundred pounds a year. On the other hand, how long (with such a\r\ntemper as she had revealed) would Grace have remained in the service of\r\nher protectress? She would probably have been dismissed in a few weeks,\r\nwith a year\xe2\x80\x99s salary to compensate her, and with a recommendation to\r\nsome suitable employment. What would be a fair compensation now? Lady\r\nJanet decided that five years\xe2\x80\x99 salary immediately given, and future\r\nassistance rendered if necessary, would represent a fit remembrance\r\nof the late Colonel Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s claims, and a liberal pecuniary\r\nacknowledgment of any harshness of treatment which Grace might have\r\nsustained at her hands. At the same time, and for the further satisfying\r\nof her own conscience, she determined to discover the sum which Grace\r\nherself would consider sufficient by the simple process of making Grace\r\nherself propose the terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible for me to make you an offer,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor this\r\nreason--your need of money will depend greatly on your future plans. I\r\nam quite ignorant of your future plans.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps your ladyship will kindly advise me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, satirically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot altogether undertake to advise you,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan only suppose that you will scarcely remain in England, where you\r\nhave no friends. Whether you go to law with me or not, you will surely\r\nfeel the necessity of communicating personally with your friends in\r\nCanada. Am I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace was quite quick enough to understand this as it was meant.\r\nProperly interpreted, the answer signified--\xe2\x80\x9cIf you take your\r\ncompensation in money, it is understood, as part of the bargain that you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t remain in England to annoy me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship is quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall certainly not remain\r\nin England. I shall consult my friends--and,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, mentally, \xe2\x80\x9cgo\r\nto law with you afterward, if I possibly can, with your own money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will return to Canada,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet proceeded; \xe2\x80\x9cand your prospects\r\nthere will be, probably, a little uncertain at first. Taking this into\r\nconsideration, at what amount do you estimate, in your own mind, the\r\npecuniary assistance which you will require?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I count on your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s, kindness to correct me if my own\r\nignorant calculations turn out to be wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d Grace asked, innocently.\r\n\r\nHere again the words, properly interpreted, had a special signification\r\nof their own: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is stipulated, on my part, that I put myself up to\r\nauction, and that my estimate shall be regulated by your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhighest bid.\xe2\x80\x9d Thoroughly understanding the stipulation, Lady Janet\r\nbowed, and waited gravely.\r\n\r\nGravely, on her side, Grace began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I should want more than a hundred pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nLady Janet made her first bid. \xe2\x80\x9cI think so too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore, perhaps, than two hundred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet made her second bid. \xe2\x80\x9cProbably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than three hundred? Four hundred? Five hundred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet made her highest bid. \xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred pounds will do,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, Grace\xe2\x80\x99s rising color betrayed her ungovernable\r\nexcitement. From her earliest childhood she had been accustomed to see\r\nshillings and sixpences carefully considered before they were parted\r\nwith. She had never known her father to possess so much as five golden\r\nsovereigns at his own disposal (unencumbered by debt) in all her\r\nexperience of him. The atmosphere in which she had lived and breathed\r\nwas the all-stifling one of genteel poverty. There was something\r\nhorrible in the greedy eagerness of her eyes as they watched Lady Janet,\r\nto see if she was really sufficiently in earnest to give away five\r\nhundred pounds sterling with a stroke of her pen.\r\n\r\nLady Janet wrote t he check in a few seconds, and pushed it across the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s hungry eyes devoured the golden line, \xe2\x80\x9cPay to myself or bearer\r\nfive hundred pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d and verified the signature beneath, \xe2\x80\x9cJanet\r\nRoy.\xe2\x80\x9d Once sure of the money whenever she chose to take it, the native\r\nmeanness of her nature instantly asserted itself. She tossed her head,\r\nand let the check lie on the table, with an overacted appearance of\r\ncaring very little whether she took it or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship is not to suppose that I snap at your check,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nLady Janet leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes. The very sight\r\nof Grace Roseberry sickened her. Her mind filled suddenly with the image\r\nof Mercy. She longed to feast her eyes again on that grand beauty, to\r\nfill her ears again with the melody of that gentle voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI require time to consider--in justice to my own self-respect,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nLady Janet wearily made a sign, granting time to consider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir is, I presume, still at my disposal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet silently granted the boudoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s servants are at my orders, if I have occasion to\r\nemploy them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet suddenly opened her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole household is at your\r\norders,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace was far from being offended. If anything, she was gratified--there\r\nwas a certain triumph in having stung Lady Janet into an open outbreak\r\nof temper. She insisted forthwith on another condition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the event of my deciding to receive the check,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot,\r\nconsistently with my own self-respect, permit it to be delivered to me\r\notherwise than inclosed. Your ladyship will (if necessary) be so kind as\r\nto inclose it. Good-evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sauntered to the door, looking from side to side, with an air of\r\nsupreme disparagement, at the priceless treasures of art which adorned\r\nthe walls. Her eyes dropped superciliously on the carpet (the design of\r\na famous French painter), as if her feet condescended in walking over\r\nit. The audacity with which she had entered the room had been marked\r\nenough; it shrank to nothing before the infinitely superior proportions\r\nof the insolence with which she left it.\r\n\r\nThe instant the door was closed Lady Janet rose from her chair. Reckless\r\nof the wintry chill in the outer air, she threw open one of the windows.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPah!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a shudder of disgust, \xe2\x80\x9cthe very air of the\r\nroom is tainted by her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned to her chair. Her mood changed as she sat down again--her\r\nheart was with Mercy once more. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my love!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured \xe2\x80\x9chow low I\r\nhave stooped, how miserably I have degraded myself--and all for You!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The bitterness of the retrospect was unendurable. The inbred force of\r\nthe woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature took refuge from it in an outburst of defiance and\r\ndespair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever she has done, that wretch deserves it! Not a living\r\ncreature in this house shall say she has deceived me. She has _not_\r\ndeceived me--she loves me! What do I care whether she has given me her\r\ntrue name or not! She has given me her true heart. What right had Julian\r\nto play upon her feelings and pry into her secrets? My poor, tempted,\r\ntortured child! I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear her confession. Not another word shall she\r\nsay to any living creature. I am mistress--I will forbid it at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She snatched a sheet of notepaper from the case; hesitated, and threw it\r\nfrom her on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not send for my darling?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nwrite?\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated once more, and resigned the idea. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrust myself! I daren\xe2\x80\x99t see her yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up the sheet of paper again, and wrote her second message to\r\nMercy. This time the note began fondly with a familiar form of address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR CHILD--I have had time to think and compose myself a little,\r\nsince I last wrote, requesting you to defer the explanation which you\r\nhad promised me. I already understand (and appreciate) the motives\r\nwhich led you to interfere as you did downstairs, and I now ask you to\r\nentirely abandon the explanation. It will, I am sure, be painful to\r\nyou (for reasons of your own into which I have no wish to inquire) to\r\nproduce the person of whom you spoke, and as you know already, I myself\r\nam weary of hearing of her. Besides, there is really no need now for you\r\nto explain anything. The stranger whose visits here have caused us so\r\nmuch pain and anxiety will trouble us no more. She leaves England of\r\nher own free will, after a conversation with me which has perfectly\r\nsucceeded in composing and satisfying her. Not a word more, my dear,\r\nto me, or to my nephew, or to any other human creature, of what has\r\nhappened in the dining-room to-day. When we next meet, let it be\r\nunderstood between us that the past is henceforth and forever _buried\r\nto oblivion_. This is not only the earnest request--it is, if necessary,\r\nthe positive command, of your mother and friend,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJANET ROY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.--I shall find opportunities (before you leave your room) of\r\nspeaking separately to my nephew and to Horace Holmcroft. You need dread\r\nno embarrassment, when you next meet them. I will not ask you to answer\r\nmy note in writing. Say yes to the maid who will bring it to you, and I\r\nshall know we understand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sealing the envelope which inclosed these lines, Lady Janet\r\naddressed it, as usual, to \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grace Roseberry.\xe2\x80\x9d She was just rising\r\nto ring the bell, when the maid appeared with a message from the\r\nboudoir. The woman\xe2\x80\x99s tones and looks showed plainly that she had been\r\nmade the object of Grace\xe2\x80\x99s insolent self-assertion as well as her\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, my lady, the person downstairs wishes--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet, frowning contemptuously, interrupted the message at the\r\noutset. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what the person downstairs wishes. She has sent you for\r\na letter from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has sent one of the men-servants, my lady, for a cab. If your\r\nladyship had only heard how she spoke to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet intimated by a sign that she would rather not hear. She at\r\nonce inclosed the check in an undirected envelope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that to her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand then come back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDismissing Grace Roseberry from all further consideration, Lady Janet\r\nsat, with her letter to Mercy in her hand, reflecting on her position,\r\nand on the efforts which it might still demand from her. Pursuing this\r\ntrain of thought, it now occurred to her that accident might bring\r\nHorace and Mercy together at any moment, and that, in Horace\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\nframe of mind, he would certainly insist on the very explanation which\r\nit was the foremost interest of her life to suppress. The dread of this\r\ndisaster was in full possession of her when the maid returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr. Holmcroft?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, the moment the woman entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him open the library door, my lady, just now, on my way\r\nupstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to him, and say I want to see him here immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maid withdrew on her second errand. Lady Janet rose restlessly, and\r\nclosed the open window. Her impatient desire to make sure of Horace so\r\ncompletely mastered her that she left her room, and met the woman in\r\nthe corridor on her return. Receiving Horace\xe2\x80\x99s message of excuse, she\r\ninstantly sent back the peremptory rejoinder, \xe2\x80\x9cSay that he will oblige\r\nme to go to him, if he persists in refusing to come to me. And, stay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she added, remembering the undelivered letter. \xe2\x80\x9cSend Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid here; I want her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft alone again, Lady Janet paced once or twice up and down the\r\ncorridor--then grew suddenly weary of the sight of it, and went back to\r\nher room. The two maids returned together. One of them, having announced\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s submission, was dismissed. The other was sent to Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s room\r\nwith Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s letter. In a minute or two the messenger appeared\r\nagain, with the news that she had found the room empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any idea where Miss Roseberry is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet reflected for a moment. If Horace presented himself without\r\nany needless delay, the plain inference would he that she had succeeded\r\nin separating him from Mercy. If his appearance was suspiciously\r\ndeferred, she decided on personally searching for Mercy in the reception\r\nrooms on the lower floor of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done with the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left it on Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s table, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Keep within hearing of the bell, in case I want you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother minute brought Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s suspense to an end. She heard the\r\nwelcome sound of a knock at her door from a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Horace hurriedly\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want with me, Lady Janet?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, not very\r\ngraciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Horace, and you shall hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace did not accept the invitation. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\nmention that I am rather in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you in a hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reasons for wishing to see Grace as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _I_ have reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cfor wishing to speak to\r\nyou about Grace before you see her; serious reasons. Sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace started. \xe2\x80\x9cSerious reasons?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall surprise you still more before I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met as Lady Janet answered in those terms. Horace observed\r\nsigns of agitation in her, which he now noticed for the first time. His\r\nface darkened with an expression of sullen distrust--and he took the\r\nchair in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. LADY JANET\xe2\x80\x99S LETTER.\r\n\r\nTHE narrative leaves Lady Janet and Horace Holmcroft together, and\r\nreturns to Julian and Mercy in the library.\r\n\r\nAn interval passed--a long interval, measured by the impatient reckoning\r\nof suspense--after the cab which had taken Grace Roseberry away had left\r\nthe house. The minutes followed each other; and still the warning sound\r\nof Horace\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps was not heard on the marble pavement of the\r\nhall. By common (though unexpressed) consent, Julian and Mercy avoided\r\ntouching upon the one subject on which they were now both interested\r\nalike. With their thoughts fixed secretly in vain speculation on the\r\nnature of the interview which was then taking place in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, they tried to speak on topics indifferent to both of them--tried,\r\nand failed, and tried again. In a last and longest pause of silence\r\nbetween them, the next event happened. The door from the hall was softly\r\nand suddenly opened.\r\n\r\nWas it Horace? No--not even yet. The person who had opened the door was\r\nonly Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady\xe2\x80\x99s love, miss; and will you please to read this directly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiving her message in those terms, the woman produced from the pocket\r\nof her apron Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s second letter to Mercy, with a strip of paper\r\noddly pinned round the envelope. Mercy detached the paper, and found on\r\nthe inner side some lines in pencil, hurriedly written in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. They ran thus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lose a moment in reading my letter. And mind this, when H.\r\nreturns to you--meet him firmly: say nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEnlightened by the warning words which Julian had spoken to her, Mercy\r\nwas at no loss to place the right interpretation on those strange lines.\r\nInstead of immediately opening the letter, she stopped the maid at the\r\nlibrary door. Julian\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion of the most trifling events that were\r\ntaking place in the house had found its way from his mind to hers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what is going on upstairs; I want\r\nto ask you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman came back--not very willingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know I was here?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, miss, her ladyship ordered me to take the letter to you\r\nsome little time since. You were not in your room, and I left it on your\r\ntable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that. But how came you to bring the letter here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady rang for me, miss. Before I could knock at her door she came\r\nout into the corridor with that morsel of paper in her hand--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo as to keep you from entering her room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss. Her ladyship wrote on the paper in a great hurry, and told\r\nme to pin it round the letter that I had left in your room. I was to\r\ntake them both together to you, and to let nobody see me. \xe2\x80\x98You will find\r\nMiss Roseberry in the library\xe2\x80\x99 (her ladyship says), \xe2\x80\x98and run, run, run!\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a moment to lose!\xe2\x80\x99 Those were her own words, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear anything in the room before Lady Janet came out and met\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated, and looked at Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know whether I ought to tell you, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian turned away to leave the library. Mercy stopped him by a motion\r\nof her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I shall not get you into any trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the\r\nmaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you may speak quite safely before Mr. Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus re-assured, the maid spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo own the truth, miss, I heard Mr. Holmcroft in my lady\xe2\x80\x99s room. His\r\nvoice sounded as if he was angry. I may say they were both angry--Mr.\r\nHolmcroft and my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d (She turned to Julian.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd just before her\r\nladyship came out, sir, I heard your name, as if it was you they were\r\nhaving words about. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say exactly what it was; I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time to\r\nhear. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen, miss; the door was ajar; and the voices were\r\nso loud nobody could help hearing them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was useless to detain the woman any longer. Having given her leave to\r\nwithdraw, Mercy turned to Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy were they quarreling about you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nJulian pointed to the unopened letter in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer to your question may be there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cRead the letter\r\nwhile you have the chance. And if I can advise you, say so at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a strange reluctance she opened the envelope. With a sinking\r\nheart she read the lines in which Lady Janet, as \xe2\x80\x9cmother and friend,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n commanded her absolutely to suppress the confession which she had\r\npledged herself to make in the sacred interests of justice and truth.\r\nA low cry of despair escaped her, as the cruel complication in her\r\nposition revealed itself in all its unmerited hardship. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lady Janet,\r\nLady Janet!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was but one trial more left in my hard\r\nlot--and it comes to me from _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe handed the letter to Julian. He took it from her in silence. His\r\npale complexion turned paler still as he read it. His eyes rested on her\r\ncompassionately as he handed it back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet herself sets all further doubt at\r\nrest. Her letter tells me what she wanted when she sent for Horace, and\r\nwhy my name was mentioned between them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mercy, eagerly.\r\n\r\nHe did not immediately answer her. He sat down again in the chair by her\r\nside, and pointed to the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Lady Janet shaken your resolution?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has strengthened my resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy answered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has added a\r\nnew bitterness to my remorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not mean it harshly, but the reply sounded harshly in Julian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears. It stirred the generous impulses, which were the strongest\r\nimpulses in his nature. He who had once pleaded with Mercy for\r\ncompassionate consideration for herself now pleaded with her for\r\ncompassionate consideration for Lady Janet. With persuasive gentleness\r\nhe drew a little nearer, and laid his hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t judge her harshly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is wrong, miserably wrong. She\r\nhas recklessly degraded herself; she has recklessly tempted you. Still,\r\nis it generous--is it even just--to hold her responsible for deliberate\r\nsin? She is at the close of her days; she can feel no new affection; she\r\ncan never replace you. View her position in that light, and you will see\r\n(as I see) that it is no base motive which has led her astray. Think of\r\nher wounded heart and her wasted life--and say to yourself forgivingly,\r\nShe loves me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do say it!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cNot forgivingly--it is _I_ who have need\r\nof forgiveness. I say it gratefully when I think of her--I say it with\r\nshame and sorrow when I think of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand for the first time. He looked, guiltlessly looked, at\r\nher downcast face. He spoke as he had spoken at the memorable interview\r\nbetween them which had made a new woman of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine no crueler trial,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthan the trial that is now\r\nbefore you. The benefactress to whom you owe everything asks nothing\r\nfrom you but your silence. The person whom you have wronged is no longer\r\npresent to stimulate your resolution to speak. Horace himself (unless I\r\nam entirely mistaken) will not hold you to the explanation that you have\r\npromised. The temptation to keep your false position in this house is, I\r\ndo not scruple to say, all but irresistible. Sister and friend! can you\r\nstill justify my faith in you? Will you still own the truth, without\r\nthe base fear of discovery to drive you to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head, with the steady light of resolution shining again\r\nin her grand, gray eyes. Her low, sweet voice answered him, without a\r\nfaltering note in it,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do justice to the woman whom you have wronged--unworthy as she\r\nis; powerless as she is to expose you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will sacrifice everything you have gained by the fraud to the\r\nsacred duty of atonement? You will suffer anything--even though you\r\noffend the second mother who has loved you and sinned for you--rather\r\nthan suffer the degradation of yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand closed firmly on his. Again, and for the last time, she\r\nanswered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice had not trembled yet. It failed him now. His next words were\r\nspoken in faint whispering tones--to himself; not to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God for this day!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been of some service to one\r\nof the noblest of God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome subtle influence, as he spoke, passed from his hand to hers. It\r\ntrembled through her nerves; it entwined itself mysteriously with the\r\nfinest sensibilities in her nature; it softly opened her heart to a\r\nfirst vague surmising of the devotion that she had inspired in him. A\r\nfaint glow of color, lovely in its faintness, stole over her face and\r\nneck. Her breathing quickened tremblingly. She drew her hand away from\r\nhim, and sighed when she had released it.\r\n\r\nHe rose suddenly to his feet and left her, without a word or a look,\r\nwalking slowly down the length of the room. When he turned and came back\r\nto her, his face was composed; he was master of himself again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercy was the first to speak. She turned the conversation from herself\r\nby reverting to the proceedings in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke of Horace just now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cin terms which surprised me.\r\nYou appeared to think that he would not hold me to my explanation. Is\r\nthat one of the conclusions which you draw from Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost assuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will see the conclusion as I\r\nsee it if we return for a moment to Grace Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s departure from the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy interrupted him there. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you guess,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9chow Lady Janet\r\nprevailed upon her to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly like to own it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is an expression in the\r\nletter which suggests to me that Lady Janet has offered her money, and\r\nthat she has taken the bribe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us return to Horace. Miss Roseberry once out of the house, but one\r\nserious obstacle is left in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s way. That obstacle is Horace\r\nHolmcroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Horace an obstacle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an obstacle in this sense. He is under an engagement to marry you\r\nin a week\xe2\x80\x99s time; and Lady Janet is determined to keep him (as she is\r\ndetermined to keep every one else) in ignorance of the truth. She will\r\ndo that without scruple. But the inbred sense of honor in her is not\r\nutterly silenced yet. She cannot, she dare not, let Horace make you\r\nhis wife under the false impression that you are Colonel Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter. You see the situation? On the one hand, she won\xe2\x80\x99t enlighten\r\nhim. On the other hand, she cannot allow him to marry you blindfold. In\r\nthis emergency what is she to do? There is but one alternative that I\r\ncan discover. She must persuade Horace (or she must irritate Horace)\r\ninto acting for himself, and breaking off the engagement on his own\r\nresponsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy stopped him. \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook again at her letter,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cIt tells, you plainly that\r\nyou need fear no embarrassment when you next meet Horace. If words\r\nmean anything, those words mean that he will not claim from you the\r\nconfidence which you have promised to repose in him. On what condition\r\nis it possible for him to abstain from doing that? On the one condition\r\nthat you have ceased to represent the first and foremost interest of his\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy still held firm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are wronging Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nJulian smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to look at it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s point of view. Do\r\nyou suppose _she_ sees anything derogatory to her in attempting to break\r\noff the marriage? I will answer for it, she believes she is doing you a\r\nkindness. In one sense it _would_ be a kindness to spare you the shame\r\nof a humiliating confession, and to save you (possibly) from being\r\nrejected to your face by the man you love. In my opinion, the thing is\r\ndone already. I have reasons of my own for believing that my aunt will\r\nsucceed far more easily than she could anticipate. Horace\xe2\x80\x99s temper will\r\nhelp her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s mind began to yield to him, in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by Horace\xe2\x80\x99s temper?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you ask me that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drawing back a little from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean by Horace\xe2\x80\x99s temper, Horace\xe2\x80\x99s unworthy distrust of the interest\r\nthat I feel in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe instantly understood him. And more than that, she secretly admired\r\nhim for the scrupulous delicacy with which he had expressed himself.\r\nAnother man would not have thought of sparing her in that way. Another\r\nman would have said, plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cHorace is jealous of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian did not wait for her to answer him. He considerately went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason that I have just mentioned,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHorace will be\r\neasily irritated into taking a course which, in his calmer moments,\r\nnothing would induce him to adopt. Until I heard what your maid said to\r\nyou I had thought (for your sake) of retiring before he joined you\r\nhere. Now I know that my name has been introduced, and has made mischief\r\nupstairs, I feel the necessity (for your sake again) of meeting Horace\r\nand his temper face to face before you see him. Let me, if I can,\r\nprepare him to hear you without any angry feeling in his mind toward\r\nyou. Do you object to retire to the next room for a few minutes in the\r\nevent of his coming back to the library?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s courage instantly rose with the emergency. She refused to leave\r\nthe two men together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think me insensible to your kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I leave you\r\nwith Horace I may expose you to insult. I refuse to do that. What makes\r\nyou doubt his coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis prolonged absence makes me doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my\r\nbelief, the marriage is broken off. He may go as Grace Roseberry has\r\ngone. You may never see him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant the opinion was uttered, it was practically contradicted by\r\nthe man himself. Horace opened the library door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. THE CONFESSION\r\n\r\nHE stopped just inside the door. His first look was for Mercy; his is\r\nsecond look was for Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an assumption of sardonic composure. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\ncould only have persuaded Lady Janet to bet, I should have won a hundred\r\npounds.\xe2\x80\x9d He advanced to Julian, with a sudden change from irony to\r\nanger. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to hear what the bet was?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should prefer seeing you able to control yourself in the presence of\r\nthis lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian answered, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offered to lay Lady Janet two hundred pounds to one,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace\r\nproceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should find you here, making love to Miss Roseberry\r\nbehind my back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy interfered before Julian could reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you cannot speak without insulting one of us,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cpermit me\r\nto request that you will _not_ address yourself to Mr. Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace bowed to her with a mockery of respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t alarm yourself--I am pledged to be scrupulously civil to\r\nboth of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet only allowed me to leave her on\r\ncondition of my promising to behave with perfect politeness. What else\r\ncan I do? I have two privileged people to deal with--a parson and\r\na woman. The parson\xe2\x80\x99s profession protects him, and the woman\xe2\x80\x99s sex\r\nprotects her. You have got me at a disadvantage, and you both of\r\nyou know it. I beg to apologize if I have forgotten the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprofession and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have forgotten more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julian. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have forgotten\r\nthat you were born a gentleman and bred a man of honor. So far as I am\r\nconcerned, I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to remember that I am a clergyman--I obtrude\r\nmy profession on nobody--I only ask you to remember your birth and your\r\nbreeding. It is quite bad enough to cruelly and unjustly suspect an old\r\nfriend who has never forgotten what he owes to you and to himself. But\r\nit is still more unworthy of you to acknowledge those suspicions in\r\nthe hearing of a woman whom your own choice has doubly bound you to\r\nrespect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The two eyed each other for a moment in silence.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Mercy to look at them, as she was looking now,\r\nwithout drawing the inevitable comparison between the manly force and\r\ndignity of Julian and the womanish malice and irritability of Horace.\r\nA last faithful impulse of loyalty toward the man to whom she had\r\nbeen betrothed impelled her to part them, before Horace had hopelessly\r\ndegraded himself in her estimation by contrast with Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better wait to speak to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil we are\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace answered with a sneer, \xe2\x80\x9cif Mr. Julian Gray will\r\npermit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy turned to Julian, with a look which said plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cPity us both,\r\nand leave us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish me to go?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdd to all your other kindnesses to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWait for me in\r\nthat room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the door that led into the dining-room. Julian hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promise to let me know it if I can be of the smallest service to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d She followed him as he withdrew, and added, rapidly, in a\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave the door ajar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer. As she returned to Horace he entered the dining-room.\r\nThe one concession he could make to her he did make. He closed the door\r\nso noiselessly that not even her quick hearing could detect that he had\r\nshut it.\r\n\r\nMercy spoke to Horace, without waiting to let him speak first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have promised you an explanation of my conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in accents\r\nthat trembled a little in spite of herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to perform my\r\npromise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a question to ask you before you do that,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you\r\nspeak the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting to speak the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you an opportunity. Are you or are you not in love with\r\nJulian Gray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be ashamed to ask the question!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your only answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been unfaithful to you, Horace, even in thought. If I had\r\n_not_ been true to you, should I feel my position as you see I feel it\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have my own opinion of your fidelity and of his\r\nhonor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even send him into the next room without\r\nwhispering to him first. Never mind that now. At least you know that\r\nJulian Gray is in love with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Julian Gray has never breathed a word of it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man can show a woman that he loves her, without saying it in words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s power of endurance began to fail her. Not even Grace Roseberry\r\nhad spoken more insultingly to her of Julian than Horace was speaking\r\nnow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever says that of Mr. Julian Gray, lies!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Lady Janet lies,\xe2\x80\x9d Horace retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet never said it! Lady Janet is incapable of saying it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may not have said it in so many words; but she never denied it when\r\n_I_ said it. I reminded her of the time when Julian Gray first heard\r\nfrom me that I was going to marry you: he was so overwhelmed that he was\r\nbarely capable of being civil to me. Lady Janet was present, and could\r\nnot deny it. I asked her if she had observed, since then, signs of\r\na confidential understanding between you two. She could not deny the\r\nsigns. I asked if she had ever found you two together. She could not\r\ndeny that she had found you together, this very day, under circumstances\r\nwhich justified suspicion. Yes! yes! Look as angry as you like! you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what has been going on upstairs. Lady Janet is bent on\r\nbreaking off our engagement--and Julian Gray is at the bottom of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs to Julian, Horace was utterly wrong. But as to Lady Janet, he echoed\r\nthe warning words which Julian himself had spoken to Mercy. She was\r\nstaggered, but she still held to her own opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, firmly.\r\n\r\nHe advanced a step, and fixed his angry eyes on her searchingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why Lady Janet sent for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will tell you. Lady Janet is a stanch friend of yours, there is\r\nno denying that. She wished to inform me that she had altered her mind\r\nabout your promised explanation of your conduct. She said, \xe2\x80\x98Reflection\r\nhas convinced me that no explanation is required; I have laid my\r\npositive commands on my adopted daughter that no explanation shall take\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x99 Has she done that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow observe! I waited till she had finished, and then I said, \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nhave I to do with this?\xe2\x80\x99 Lady Janet has one merit--she speaks out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are to do as I do,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered. \xe2\x80\x98You are to consider that no\r\nexplanation is required, and you are to consign the whole matter to\r\noblivion from this time forth.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Are you serious?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Quite\r\nserious.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98In that case I have to inform your ladyship that you insist\r\non more than you may suppose: you insist on my breaking my engagement\r\nto Miss Roseberry. Either I am to have the explanation that she has\r\npromised me, or I refuse to marry her.\xe2\x80\x99 How do you think Lady Janet took\r\nthat? She shut up her lips, and she spread out her hands, and she looked\r\nat me as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98Just as you please! Refuse if you like; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing to me!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment. Mercy remained silent, on her side: she foresaw\r\nwhat was coming. Mistaken in supposing that Horace had left the house,\r\nJulian had, beyond all doubt, been equally in error in concluding that\r\nhe had been entrapped into breaking off the engagement upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand me so far?\xe2\x80\x9d Horace asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not trouble you much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to Lady Janet,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be so good as to answer me in plain words. Do you still insist on\r\nclosing Miss Roseberry\xe2\x80\x99s lips?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I still insist,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No explanation is required. If you are base enough to suspect your\r\nbetrothed wife, I am just enough to believe in my adopted daughter.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nreplied--and I beg you will give your best attention to what I am now\r\ngoing to say--I replied to that, \xe2\x80\x98It is not fair to charge me with\r\nsuspecting her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand her confidential relations with\r\nJulian Gray, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand her language and conduct in the\r\npresence of the police officer. I claim it as my right to be satisfied\r\non both those points--in the character of the man who is to marry her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThere was my answer. I spare you all that followed. I only repeat what I\r\nsaid to Lady Janet. She has commanded you to be silent. If you obey her\r\ncommands, I owe it to myself and I owe it to my family to release you\r\nfrom your engagement. Choose between your duty to Lady Janet and your\r\nduty to Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had mastered his temper at last: he spoke with dignity, and he spoke\r\nto the point. His position was unassailable; he claimed nothing but his\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy choice was made,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercy answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I gave you my promise\r\nupstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a little, struggling to control herself on the brink of the\r\nterrible revelation that was coming. Her eyes dropped before his;\r\nher heart beat faster and faster; but she struggled bravely. With a\r\ndesperate courage she faced the position. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are ready to listen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to tell you why I insisted on having the police\r\nofficer sent out of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace held up his hand warningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is not all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis infatuated jealousy of Julian (fatally misinterpreting her\r\nagitation) distrusted her at the very outset. She had limited herself\r\nto clearing up the one question of her interference with the officer\r\nof justice. The other question of her relations with Julian she had\r\ndeliberately passed over. Horace instantly drew his own ungenerous\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us not misunderstand one another,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe explanation of\r\nyour conduct in the other room is only one of the explanations which\r\nyou owe me. You have something else to account for. Let us begin with\r\n_that_, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in unaffected surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else have I to account for?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe again repeated his reply to Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you already,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your\r\nconfidential relations with Julian Gray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s color rose; Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes began to brighten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t return to that!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with an irrepressible outbreak of\r\ndisgust. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, make me despise you at such a moment as\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis obstinacy only gathered fresh encouragement from that appeal to his\r\nbetter sense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI insist on returning to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had resolved to bear anything from him--as her fit punishment for\r\nthe deception of which she had been guilty. But it was not in womanhood\r\n(at the moment when the first words of her confession were trembling on\r\nher lips) to endure Horace\xe2\x80\x99s unworthy suspicion of her. She rose from\r\nher seat and met his eye firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI refuse to degrade myself, and to degrade Mr. Julian Gray, by\r\nanswering you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider what you are doing,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cChange your mind, before it\r\nis too late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had my reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose resolute words, that steady resistance, seemed to infuriate him.\r\nHe caught her roughly by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are as false as hell!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over between you and\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe loud threatening tone in which he had spoken penetrated through\r\nthe closed door of the dining-room. The door instantly opened. Julian\r\nreturned to the library.\r\n\r\nHe had just set foot in the room, when there was a knock at the\r\nother door--the door that opened on the hall. One of the men-servants\r\nappeared, with a telegraphic message in his hand. Mercy was the first to\r\nsee it. It was the Matron\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the letter which she had sent to\r\nthe Refuge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Mr. Julian Gray?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe signed to the man to withdraw, and herself gave the telegram to\r\nJulian. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is addressed to you, at my request,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will\r\nrecognize the name of the person who sends it, and you will find a\r\nmessage in it for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace interfered before Julian could open the telegram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother private understanding between you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me that\r\ntelegram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian looked at him with quiet contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is directed to Me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered--and opened the envelope.\r\n\r\nThe message inside was expressed in these terms: \xe2\x80\x9cI am as deeply\r\ninterested in her as you are. Say that I have received her letter, and\r\nthat I welcome her back to the Refuge with all my heart. I have\r\nbusiness this evening in the neighborhood. I will call for her myself at\r\nMablethorpe House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe message explained itself. Of her own free-will she had made the\r\nexpiation complete! Of her own free-will she was going back to the\r\nmartyrdom of her old life! Bound as he knew himself to be to let no\r\ncompromising word or action escape him in the presence of Horace, the\r\nirrepressible expression of Julian\xe2\x80\x99s admiration glowed in his eyes as\r\nthey rested on Mercy. Horace detected the look. He sprang forward and\r\ntried to snatch the telegram out of Julian\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will have it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian silently put him back at arms-length.\r\n\r\nMaddened with rage, he lifted his hand threateningly. \xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he repeated between his set teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cor it will be the worse for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercy, suddenly placing herself between them.\r\n\r\nJulian gave it. She turned, and offered it to Horace, looking at him\r\nwith a steady eye, holding it out to him with a steady hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s generous nature pitied the man who had insulted him. Julian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat heart only remembered the friend of former times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare him!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember he is unprepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe neither answered nor moved. Nothing stirred the horrible torpor of\r\nher resignation to her fate. She knew that the time had come.\r\n\r\nJulian appealed to Horace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t read it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHear what she has to say to you first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s hand answered him with a contemptuous gesture. Horace\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\ndevoured, word by word, the Matron\xe2\x80\x99s message.\r\n\r\nHe looked up when he had read it through. There was a ghastly change in\r\nhis face as he turned it on Mercy.\r\n\r\nShe stood between the two men like a statue. The life in her seemed\r\nto have died out, except in her eyes. Her eyes rested on Horace with a\r\nsteady, glittering calmness.\r\n\r\nThe silence was only broken by the low murmuring of Julian\xe2\x80\x99s voice. His\r\nface was hidden in his hands--he was praying for them.\r\n\r\nHorace spoke, laying his finger on the telegram. His voice had changed\r\nwith the change in his face. The tone was low and trembling: no one\r\nwould have recognized it as the tone of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have You to do with a Refuge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a change in her face, without a movement in her limbs, she spoke\r\nthe fatal words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come from a Refuge, and I am going back to a Refuge. Mr. Horace\r\nHolmcroft, I am Mercy Merrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. GREAT HEART AND LITTLE HEART.\r\n\r\nTHERE was a pause.\r\n\r\nThe moments passed--and not one of the three moved. The moments\r\npassed--and not one of the three spoke. Insensibly the words of\r\nsupplication died away on Julian\xe2\x80\x99s lips. Even his energy failed to\r\nsustain him, tried as it now was by the crushing oppression of suspense.\r\nThe first trifling movement which suggested the idea of change, and\r\nwhich so brought with it the first vague sense of relief, came from\r\nMercy. Incapable of sustaining the prolonged effort of standing, she\r\ndrew back a little and took a chair. No outward manifestation of emotion\r\nescaped her. There she sat--with the death-like torpor of resignation in\r\nher face--waiting her sentence in silence from the man at whom she had\r\nhurled the whole terrible confession of the truth in one sentence!\r\n\r\nJulian lifted his head as she moved. He looked at Horace, and advancing\r\na few steps, looked again. There was fear in his face, as he suddenly\r\nturned it toward Mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to him!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cRouse him, before it\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nlate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved mechanically in her chair; she looked mechanically at Julian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat more have I to say to him?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in faint, weary tones. \xe2\x80\x9cDid\r\nI not tell him everything when I told him my name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe natural sound of her voice might have failed to affect Horace. The\r\naltered sound of it roused him. He approached Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s chair, with a dull\r\nsurprise in his face, and put his hand, in a weak, wavering way, on her\r\nshoulder. In that position he stood for a while, looking down at her in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe one idea in him that found its way outward to expression was the\r\nidea of Julian. Without moving his hand, without looking up from Mercy,\r\nhe spoke for the first time since the shock had fallen on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Julian?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, very quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here, Horace--close by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you do me a service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. How can I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe considered a little before he replied. His hand left Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, and went up to his head--then dropped at his side. His next\r\nwords were spoken in a sadly helpless, bewildered way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an idea, Julian, that I have been somehow to blame. I said some\r\nhard words to you. It was a little while since. I don\xe2\x80\x99t clearly remember\r\nwhat it was all about. My temper has been a good deal tried in this\r\nhouse; I have never been used to the sort of thing that goes on\r\nhere--secrets and mysteries, and hateful low-lived quarrels. We have\r\nno secrets and mysteries at home. And as for quarrels--ridiculous!\r\nMy mother and my sisters are highly bred women (you know them);\r\ngentlewomen, in the best sense of the word. When I am with _them_ I have\r\nno anxieties. I am not harassed at home by doubts of who people are, and\r\nconfusion about names, and so on. I suspect the contrast weighs a little\r\non my mind and upsets it. They make me over-suspicious among them here,\r\nand it ends in my feeling doubts and fears that I can\xe2\x80\x99t get over: doubts\r\nabout you and fears about myself. I have got a fear about myself now. I\r\nwant you to help me. Shall I make an apology first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. Tell me what I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his face toward Julian for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it strike you that I am at all wrong\r\nin my mind? Tell me the truth, old fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour nerves are a little shaken, Horace. Nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe considered again after that reply, his eyes remaining anxiously fixed\r\non Julian\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves are a little shaken,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is true; I feel they\r\nare shaken. I should like, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, to make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nworse. Will you help me to try if my memory is all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do anything you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are a good fellow, Julian--and a clear-headed fellow too, which\r\nis very important just now. Look here! I say it\xe2\x80\x99s about a week since the\r\ntroubles began in this house. Do you say so too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe troubles came in with the coming of a woman from Germany, a\r\nstranger to us, who behaved very violently in the dining-room there. Am\r\nI right, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman carried matters with a high hand. She claimed Colonel\r\nRoseberry--I wish to be strictly accurate--she claimed _the late_\r\nColonel Roseberry as her father. She told a tiresome story about her\r\nhaving been robbed of her papers and her name by an impostor who had\r\npersonated her. She said the name of the impostor was Mercy Merrick. And\r\nshe afterward put the climax to it all: she pointed to the lady who is\r\nengaged to be my wife, and declared that _she_ was Mercy Merrick. Tell\r\nme again, is that right or wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian answered him as before. He went on, speaking more confidently and\r\nmore excitedly than he had spoken yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow attend to this, Julian. I am going to pass from my memory of what\r\nhappened a week ago to my memory of what happened five minutes since.\r\nYou were present; I want to know if you heard it too.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and,\r\nwithout taking his eyes off Julian, pointed backward to Mercy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nthe lady who is engaged to marry me,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I, or did I not,\r\nhear her say that she had come out of a Refuge, and that she was going\r\nback to a Refuge? Did I, or did I not, hear her own to my face that her\r\nname was Mercy Merrick? Answer me, Julian. My good friend, answer me,\r\nfor the sake of old times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice faltered as he spoke those imploring words. Under the dull\r\nblank of his face there appeared the first signs of emotion slowly\r\nforcing its way outward. The stunned mind was reviving faintly. Julian\r\nsaw his opportunity of aiding the recovery, and seized it. He took\r\nHorace gently by the arm, and pointed to Mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is your answer!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook!--and pity her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had not once interrupted them while they had been speaking: she had\r\nchanged her position again, and that was all. There was a writing-table\r\nat the side of her chair; her outstretched arms rested on it. Her head\r\nhad dropped on her arms, and her face was hidden. Julian\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\r\nhad not misled him; the utter self-abandonment of her attitude answered\r\nHorace as no human language could have answered him. He looked at her.\r\nA quick spasm of pain passed across his face. He turned once more to\r\nthe faithful friend who had forgiven him. His head fell on Julian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, and he burst into tears.\r\n\r\nMercy started wildly to her feet, and looked at the two men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian quieted her by a motion of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have helped me to save him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet his tears have their\r\nway. Wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put one arm round Horace to support him. The manly tenderness of the\r\naction, the complete and noble pardon of past injuries which it implied,\r\ntouched Mercy to the heart. She went back to her chair. Again shame and\r\nsorrow overpowered her, and again she hid her face from view.\r\n\r\nJulian led Horace to a seat, and silently waited by him until he had\r\nrecovered his self-control. He gratefully took the kind hand that had\r\nsustained him: he said, simply, almost boyishly, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Julian. I\r\nam better now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you composed enough to listen to what is said to you?\xe2\x80\x9d Julian\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Do _you_ wish to speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian left him without immediately replying, and returned to Mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him all--truly, unreservedly, as you\r\nwould tell it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shuddered as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I not told him enough?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to break his heart? Look at him! Look what I have done\r\nalready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace shrank from the ordeal as Mercy shrank from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! I can\xe2\x80\x99t listen to it! I daren\xe2\x80\x99t listen to it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and\r\nrose to leave the room.\r\n\r\nJulian had taken the good work in hand: he never faltered over it for an\r\ninstant. Horace had loved her--how dearly Julian now knew for the first\r\ntime. The bare possibility that she might earn her pardon if she was\r\nallowed to plead her own cause was a possibility still left. To let her\r\nwin on Horace to forgive her, was death to the love that still filled\r\nhis heart in secret. But he never hesitated. With a resolution which the\r\nweaker man was powerless to resist, he took him by the arm and led him\r\nback to his place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor her sake, and for your sake, you shall not condemn her unheard,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to Horace, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOne temptation to deceive you after another\r\nhas tried her, and she has resisted them all. With no discovery to fear,\r\nwith a letter from the benefactress who loves her commanding her to be\r\nsilent, with everything that a woman values in this world to lose, if\r\nshe owns what she has done--_this_ woman, for the truth\xe2\x80\x99s sake, has\r\nspoken the truth. Does she deserve nothing at your hands in return for\r\nthat? Respect her, Horace--and hear her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace yielded. Julian turned to Mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have allowed me to guide you so far,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you allow me\r\nto guide you still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes sank before his; her bosom rose and fell rapidly. His\r\ninfluence over her maintained its sway. She bowed her head in speechless\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him,\xe2\x80\x9d Julian proceeded, in accents of entreaty, not of\r\ncommand--\xe2\x80\x9ctell him what your life has been. Tell him how you were tried\r\nand tempted, with no friend near to speak the words which might have\r\nsaved you. And then,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, raising her from the chair, \xe2\x80\x9clet him\r\njudge you--if he can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe attempted to lead her across the room to the place which Horace\r\noccupied. But her submission had its limits. Half-way to the place she\r\nstopped, and refused to go further. Julian offered her a chair. She\r\ndeclined to take it. Standing with one hand on the back of the chair,\r\nshe waited for the word from Horace which would permit her to speak. She\r\nwas resigned to the ordeal. Her face was calm; her mind was clear. The\r\nhardest of all humiliations to endure--the humiliation of acknowledging\r\nher name--she had passed through. Nothing remained but to show her\r\ngratitude to Julian by acceding to his wishes, and to ask pardon of\r\nHorace before they parted forever. In a little while the Matron would\r\narrive at the house--and then it would be over.\r\n\r\nUnwillingly Horace looked at her. Their eyes met. He broke out suddenly\r\nwith something of his former violence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t realize it even now!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ it true that you are not\r\nGrace Roseberry? Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me! Say in one word--Yes or No!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered him, humbly and sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done what that woman accused you of doing? Am I to believe\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to believe it, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the weakness of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s character disclosed itself when she made\r\nthat reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInfamous!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat excuse can you make for the cruel\r\ndeception you have practiced on me? Too bad! too bad! There can be no\r\nexcuse for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe accepted his reproaches with unshaken resignation. \xe2\x80\x9cI have deserved\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI have deserved it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian interposed once more in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s defense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till you are sure there is no excuse for her, Horace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9cGrant her justice, if you can grant no more. I leave you\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advanced toward the door of the dining-room. Horace\xe2\x80\x99s weakness\r\ndisclosed itself once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave me alone with her!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cThe misery of it is more\r\nthan I can bear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian looked at Mercy. Her face brightened faintly. That momentary\r\nexpression of relief told him how truly he would be befriending her if\r\nhe consented to remain in the room. A position of retirement was offered\r\nto him by a recess formed by the central bay-window of the library. If\r\nhe occupied this place, they could see or not see that he was present,\r\nas their own inclinations might decide them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will stay with you, Horace, as long as you wish me to be here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Having answered in those terms, he stopped as he passed Mercy, on his\r\nway to the window. His quick and kindly insight told him that he might\r\nstill be of some service to her. A hint from him might show her the\r\nshortest and the easiest way of making her confession. Delicately and\r\nbriefly he gave her the hint. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first time I met you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaw that your life had had its troubles. Let us hear how those troubles\r\nbegan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe withdrew to his place in the recess. For the first time, since\r\nthe fatal evening when she and Grace Roseberry had met in the French\r\ncottage, Mercy Merrick looked back into the purgatory on earth of her\r\npast life, and told her sad story simply and truly in these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. MAGDALEN\xe2\x80\x99S APPRENTICESHIP.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMR. JULIAN GRAY has asked me to tell him, and to tell you, Mr.\r\nHolmcroft, how my troubles began. They began before my recollection.\r\nThey began with my birth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother (as I have heard her say) ruined her prospects, when she was\r\nquite a young girl, by a marriage with one of her father\xe2\x80\x99s servants--the\r\ngroom who rode out with her. She suffered, poor creature, the usual\r\npenalty of such conduct as hers. After a short time she and her husband\r\nwere separated--on the condition of her sacrificing to the man whom she\r\nhad married the whole of the little fortune that she possessed in her\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGaining her freedom, my mother had to gain her daily bread next. Her\r\nfamily refused to take her back. She attached herself to a company of\r\nstrolling players.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was earning a bare living in this way, when my father accidentally\r\nmet with her. He was a man of high rank, proud of his position, and well\r\nknown in the society of that time for his many accomplishments and his\r\nrefined tastes. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s beauty fascinated him. He took her from the\r\nstrolling players, and surrounded her with every luxury that a woman\r\ncould desire in a house of her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long they lived together. I only know that my father,\r\nat the time of my first recollections, had abandoned her. She had\r\nexcited his suspicions of her fidelity--suspicions which cruelly wronged\r\nher, as she declared to her dying day. I believed her, because she was\r\nmy mother. But I cannot expect others to do as I did--I can only repeat\r\nwhat she said. My father left her absolutely penniless. He never saw\r\nher again; and he refused to go to her when she sent to him in her last\r\nmoments on earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was back again among the strolling players when I first remember\r\nher. It was not an unhappy time for me. I was the favorite pet and\r\nplaything of the poor actors. They taught me to sing and to dance at\r\nan age when other children are just beginning to learn to read. At five\r\nyears old I was in what is called \xe2\x80\x98the profession,\xe2\x80\x99 and had made my\r\npoor little reputation in booths at country fairs. As early as that, Mr.\r\nHolmcroft, I had begun to live under an assumed name--the prettiest name\r\nthey could invent for me \xe2\x80\x98to look well in the bills.\xe2\x80\x99 It was sometimes\r\na hard struggle for us, in bad seasons, to keep body and soul together.\r\nLearning to sing and dance in public often meant learning to bear hunger\r\nand cold in private, when I was apprenticed to the stage. And yet I have\r\nlived to look back on my days with the strolling players as the happiest\r\ndays of my life!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was ten years old when the first serious misfortune that I can\r\nremember fell upon me. My mother died, worn out in the prime of her\r\nlife. And not long afterward the strolling company, brought to the end\r\nof its resources by a succession of bad seasons, was broken up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was left on the world, a nameless, penniless outcast, with one fatal\r\ninheritance--God knows, I can speak of it without vanity, after what I\r\nhave gone through!--the inheritance of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s beauty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy only friends were the poor starved-out players. Two of them (husband\r\nand wife) obtained engagements in another company, and I was included in\r\nthe bargain The new manager by whom I was employed was a drunkard and\r\na brute. One night I made a trifling mistake in the course of the\r\nperformances--and I was savagely beaten for it. Perhaps I had inherited\r\nsome of my father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit--without, I hope, also inheriting my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npitiless nature. However that may be, I resolved (no matter what became\r\nof me) never again to serve the man who had beaten me. I unlocked the\r\ndoor of our miserable lodging at daybreak the next morning; and, at ten\r\nyears old, with my little bundle in my hand, I faced the world alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother had confided to me, in her last moments, my father\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nand the address of his house in London. \xe2\x80\x98He may feel some compassion\r\nfor you\xe2\x80\x99 (she said), \xe2\x80\x98though he feels none for me: try him.\xe2\x80\x99 I had a few\r\nshillings, the last pitiful remains of my wages, in my pocket; and I was\r\nnot far from London. But I never went near my father: child as I was, I\r\nwould have starved and died rather than go to him. I had loved my mother\r\ndearly; and I hated the man who had turned his back on her when she lay\r\non her deathbed. It made no difference to Me that he happened to be my\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes this confession revolt you? You look at me, Mr. Holmcroft, as if\r\nit did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink a little, sir. Does what I have just said condemn me as a\r\nheartless creature, even in my earliest years? What is a father to a\r\nchild--when the child has never sat on his knee, and never had a kiss\r\nor a present from him? If we had met in the street, we should not have\r\nknown each other. Perhaps in after-days, when I was starving in London,\r\nI may have begged of my father without knowing it; and he may have\r\nthrown his daughter a penny to get rid of her, without knowing it\r\neither! What is there sacred in the relations between father and child,\r\nwhen they are such relations as these? Even the flowers of the field\r\ncannot grow without light and air to help them! How is a child\xe2\x80\x99s love to\r\ngrow, with nothing to help it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy small savings would have been soon exhausted, even if I had been old\r\nenough and strong enough to protect them myself. As things were, my few\r\nshillings were taken from me by gypsies. I had no reason to complain.\r\nThey gave me food and the shelter of their tents, and they made me\r\nof use to them in various ways. After a while hard times came to the\r\ngypsies, as they had come to the strolling players. Some of them were\r\nimprisoned; the rest were dispersed. It was the season for hop-gathering\r\nat the time. I got employment among the hop-pickers next; and that done,\r\nI went to London with my new friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to weary and pain you by dwelling on this part of my\r\nchildhood in detail. It will be enough if I tell you that I sank lower\r\nand lower until I ended in selling matches in the street. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegacy got me many a sixpence which my matches would never have charmed\r\nout of the pockets of strangers if I had been an ugly child. My face.\r\nwhich was destined to be my greatest misfortune in after-years, was my\r\nbest friend in those days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything, Mr. Holmcroft, in the life I am now trying to\r\ndescribe which reminds you of a day when we were out walking together\r\nnot long since?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI surprised and offended you, I remember; and it was not possible\r\nfor me to explain my conduct at the time. Do you recollect the little\r\nwandering girl, with the miserable faded nosegay in her hand, who ran\r\nafter us, and begged for a half-penny? I shocked you by bursting out\r\ncrying when the child asked us to buy her a bit of bread. Now you know\r\nwhy I was so sorry for her. Now you know why I offended you the next day\r\nby breaking an engagement with your mother and sisters, and going to see\r\nthat child in her wretched home. After what I have confessed, you will\r\nadmit that my poor little sister in adversity had the first claim on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go on. I am sorry if I have distressed you. Let me go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe forlorn wanderers of the streets have (as I found it) one way\r\nalways open to them of presenting their sufferings to the notice of\r\ntheir rich and charitable fellow-creatures. They have only to break the\r\nlaw--and they make a public appearance in a court of justice. If the\r\ncircumstances connected with their offense are of an interesting kind,\r\nthey gain a second advantage: they are advertised all over England by a\r\nreport in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! even _I_ have my knowledge of the law. I know that it completely\r\noverlooked me as long as I respected it. But on two different occasions\r\nit became my best friend when I set it at defiance! My first fortunate\r\noffense was committed when I was just twelve years old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was evening time. I was half dead with starvation; the rain was\r\nfalling; the night was coming on. I begged--openly, loudly, as only\r\na hungry child can beg. An old lady in a carriage at a shop door\r\ncomplained of my importunity. The policeman did his duty. The law gave\r\nme a supper and shelter at the station-house that night. I appeared at\r\nthe police court, and, questioned by the magistrate, I told my story\r\ntruly. It was the every-day story of thousands of children like me; but\r\nit had one element of interest in it. I confessed to having had a father\r\n(he was then dead) who had been a man of rank; and I owned (just as\r\nopenly as I owned everything else) that I had never applied to him for\r\nhelp, in resentment of his treatment of my mother. This incident was\r\nnew, I suppose; it led to the appearance of my \xe2\x80\x98case\xe2\x80\x99 in the newspapers.\r\nThe reporters further served my interests by describing me as \xe2\x80\x98pretty\r\nand interesting.\xe2\x80\x99 Subscriptions were sent to the court. A benevolent\r\nmarried couple, in a respectable sphere of life, visited the workhouse\r\nto see me. I produced a favorable impression on them--especially on the\r\nwife. I was literally friendless; I had no unwelcome relatives to follow\r\nme and claim me. The wife was childless; the husband was a good-natured\r\nman. It ended in their taking me away with them to try me in service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always felt the aspiration, no matter how low I may have fallen,\r\nto struggle upward to a position above me; to rise, in spite of fortune,\r\nsuperior to my lot in life. Perhaps some of my father\xe2\x80\x99s pride may be\r\nat the root of this restless feeling in me. It seems to be a part of\r\nmy nature. It brought me into this house--and it will go with me out of\r\nthis house. Is it my curse or my blessing? I am not able to decide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the first night when I slept in my new home I said to myself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They have taken me to be their servant: I will be something more than\r\nthat--they shall end in taking me for their child.\xe2\x80\x99 Before I had been a\r\nweek in the house I was the wife\xe2\x80\x99s favorite companion in the absence\r\nof her husband at his place of business. She was a highly accomplished\r\nwoman, greatly her husband\xe2\x80\x99s superior in cultivation, and, unfortunately\r\nfor herself, also his superior in years. The love was all on her side.\r\nExcepting certain occasions on which he roused her jealousy, they lived\r\ntogether on sufficiently friendly terms. She was one of the many wives\r\nwho resign themselves to be disappointed in their husbands--and he was\r\none of the many husbands who never know what their wives really think of\r\nthem. Her one great happiness was in teaching me. I was eager to learn;\r\nI made rapid progress. At my pliant age I soon acquired the refinements\r\nof language and manner which characterized my mistress. It is only\r\nthe truth to say that the cultivation which has made me capable of\r\npersonating a lady was her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor three happy years I lived under that friendly roof. I was between\r\nfifteen and sixteen years of age, when the fatal inheritance from my\r\nmother cast its first shadow on my life. One miserable day the wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmotherly love for me changed in an instant to the jealous hatred that\r\nnever forgives. Can you guess the reason? The husband fell in love with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was innocent; I was blameless. He owned it himself to the clergyman\r\nwho was with him at his death. By that time years had passed. It was too\r\nlate to justify me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was at an age (when I was under his care) when men are usually\r\nsupposed to regard women with tranquillity, if not with indifference. It\r\nhad been the habit of years with me to look on him as my second father.\r\nIn my innocent ignorance of the feeling which really inspired him, I\r\npermitted him to indulge in little paternal familiarities with me, which\r\ninflamed his guilty passion. His wife discovered him--not I. No words\r\ncan describe my astonishment and my horror when the first outbreak of\r\nher indignation forced on me the knowledge of the truth. On my knees I\r\ndeclared myself guiltless. On my knees I implored her to do justice\r\nto my purity and my youth. At other times the sweetest and the most\r\nconsiderate of women, jealousy had now transformed her to a perfect\r\nfury. She accused me of deliberately encouraging him; she declared\r\nshe would turn me out of the house with her own hands. Like other\r\neasy-tempered men, her husband had reserves of anger in him which it was\r\ndangerous to provoke. When his wife lifted her hand against me, he lost\r\nall self-control, on his side. He openly told her that life was worth\r\nnothing to him without me. He openly avowed his resolution to go with me\r\nwhen I left the house. The maddened woman seized him by the arm--I saw\r\nthat, and saw no more. I ran out into the street, panic-stricken. A\r\ncab was passing. I got into it before he could open the house door, and\r\ndrove to the only place of refuge I could think of--a small shop, kept\r\nby the widowed sister of one of our servants. Here I obtained shelter\r\nfor the night. The next day he discovered me. He made his vile\r\nproposals; he offered me the whole of his fortune; he declared his\r\nresolution, say what I might, to return the next day. That night, by\r\nhelp of the good woman who had taken care of me--under cover of the\r\ndarkness, as if _I_ had been to blame!--I was secretly removed to the\r\nEast End of London, and placed under the charge of a trustworthy person\r\nwho lived, in a very humble way, by letting lodgings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, in a little back garret at the top of the house, I was thrown\r\nagain on the world--an age when it was doubly perilous for me to be left\r\nto my own resources to earn the bread I ate and the roof that covered\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI claim no credit to myself--young as I was, placed as I was between\r\nthe easy life of Vice and the hard life of Virtue--for acting as I did.\r\nThe man simply horrified me: my natural impulse was to escape from him.\r\nBut let it be remembered, before I approach the saddest part of my\r\nsad story, that I was an innocent girl, and that I was at least not to\r\nblame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me for dwelling as I have done on my early years. I shrink from\r\nspeaking of the events that are still to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn losing the esteem of my first benefactress, I had, in my friendless\r\nposition, lost all hold on an honest life--except the one frail hold\r\nof needle-work. The only reference of which I could now dispose was the\r\nrecommendation of me by my landlady to a place of business which largely\r\nemployed expert needle-women. It is needless for me to tell you how\r\nmiserably work of that sort is remunerated: you have read about it in\r\nthe newspapers. As long as my health lasted I contrived to live and to\r\nkeep out of debt. Few girls could have resisted as long as I did\r\nthe slowly-poisoning influences of crowded work-room, insufficient\r\nnourishment, and almost total privation of exercise. My life as a\r\nchild had been a life in the open air: it had helped to strengthen\r\na constitution naturally hardy, naturally free from all taint of\r\nhereditary disease. But my time came at last. Under the cruel stress\r\nlaid on it my health gave way. I was struck down by low fever, and\r\nsentence was pronounced on me by my fellow-lodgers: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, poor thing,\r\n_her_ troubles will soon be at an end!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prediction might have proved true--I might never have committed the\r\nerrors and endured the sufferings of after years--if I had fallen ill in\r\nanother house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was my good, or my evil, fortune--I dare not say which--to have\r\ninterested in myself and my sorrows an actress at a suburban theatre,\r\nwho occupied the room under mine. Except when her stage duties took her\r\naway for two or three hours in the evening, this noble creature\r\nnever left my bedside. Ill as she could afford it, her purse paid my\r\ninevitable expenses while I lay helpless. The landlady, moved by her\r\nexample, accepted half the weekly rent of my room. The doctor, with the\r\nChristian kindness of his profession, would take no fees. All that the\r\ntenderest care could accomplish was lavished on me; my youth and my\r\nconstitution did the rest. I struggled back to life--and then I took up\r\nmy needle again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may surprise you that I should have failed (having an actress for my\r\ndearest friend) to use the means of introduction thus offered to me to\r\ntry the stage--especially as my childish training had given me, in some\r\nsmall degree, a familiarity with the Art.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had only one motive for shrinking from an appearance at the\r\ntheatre--but it was strong enough to induce me to submit to any\r\nalternative that remained, no matter how hopeless it might be. If I\r\nshowed myself on the public stage, my discovery by the man from whom\r\nI had escaped would be only a question of time. I knew him to be\r\nhabitually a play-goer and a subscriber to a theatrical newspaper. I had\r\neven heard him speak of the theatre to which my friend was attached,\r\nand compare it advantageously with places of amusement of far higher\r\npretensions. Sooner or later, if I joined the company he would be\r\ncertain to go and see \xe2\x80\x98the new actress.\xe2\x80\x99 The bare thought of it\r\nreconciled me to returning to my needle. Before I was strong enough to\r\nendure the atmosphere of the crowded workroom I obtained permission, as\r\na favor, to resume my occupation at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely my choice was the choice of a virtuous girl? And yet the day\r\nwhen I returned to my needle was the fatal day of my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had now not only to provide for the wants of the passing hour--I had\r\nmy debts to pay. It was only to be done by toiling harder than ever, and\r\nby living more poorly than ever. I soon paid the penalty, in my weakened\r\nstate, of leading such a life as this. One evening my head turned\r\nsuddenly giddy; my heart throbbed frightfully. I managed to open the\r\nwindow, and to let the fresh air into the room, and I felt better. But I\r\nwas not sufficiently recovered to be able to thread my needle. I thought\r\nto myself, \xe2\x80\x98If I go out for half an hour, a little exercise may put me\r\nright again.\xe2\x80\x99 I had not, as I suppose, been out more than ten minutes\r\nwhen the attack from which I had suffered in my room was renewed. There\r\nwas no shop near in which I could take refuge. I tried to ring the bell\r\nof the nearest house door. Before I could reach it I fainted in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long hunger and weakness left me at the mercy of the first stranger\r\nwho might pass by, it is impossible for me to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I partially recovered my senses I was conscious of being under\r\nshelter somewhere, and of having a wine-glass containing some cordial\r\ndrink held to my lips by a man. I managed to swallow--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nlittle, or how much. The stimulant had a very strange effect on me.\r\nReviving me at first, it ended in stupefying me. I lost my senses once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I next recovered myself, the day was breaking. I was in a bed in\r\na strange room. A nameless terror seized me. I called out. Three or four\r\nwomen came in, whose faces betrayed, even to my inexperienced eyes, the\r\nshameless infamy of their lives. I started up in the bed. I implored\r\nthem to tell me where I was, and what had happened--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare me! I can say no more. Not long since you heard Miss Roseberry\r\ncall me an outcast from the streets. Now you know--as God is my judge\r\nI am speaking the truth!--now you know what made me an outcast, and in\r\nwhat measure I deserved my disgrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered, her resolution failed her, for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a few minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in low, pleading tones. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I try to\r\ngo on now, I am afraid I shall cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the chair which Julian had placed for her, turning her face\r\naside so that neither of the men could see it. One of her hands was\r\npressed over her bosom, the other hung listlessly at her side.\r\n\r\nJulian rose from the place that he had occupied. Horace neither moved\r\nnor spoke. His head was on his breast: the traces of tears on his cheeks\r\nowned mutely that she had touched his heart. Would he forgive her?\r\nJulian passed on, and approached Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\nIn silence he took the hand which hung at her side. In silence he lifted\r\nit to his lips and kissed it, as her brother might have kissed it. She\r\nstarted, but she never looked up. Some strange fear of discovery seemed\r\nto possess her. \xe2\x80\x9cHorace?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, timidly. Julian made no reply.\r\nHe went back to his place, and allowed her to think it was Horace.\r\n\r\nThe sacrifice was immense enough--feeling toward her as he felt--to be\r\nworthy of the man who made it.\r\n\r\nA few minutes had been all she asked for. In a few minutes she turned\r\ntoward them again. Her sweet voice was steady once more; her eyes rested\r\nsoftly on Horace as she went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it possible for a friendless girl in my position to do, when\r\nthe full knowledge of the outrage had been revealed to me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had possessed near and dear relatives to protect and advise me,\r\nthe wretches into whose hands I had fallen might have felt the penalty\r\nof the law. I knew no more of the formalities which set the law in\r\nmotion than a child. But I had another alternative (you will say).\r\nCharitable societies would have received me and helped me, if I had\r\nstated my case to them. I knew no more of the charitable societies than\r\nI knew of the law. At least, then, I might have gone back to the honest\r\npeople among whom I had lived? When I received my freedom, after the\r\ninterval of some days, I was ashamed to go back to the honest people.\r\nHelplessly and hopelessly, without sin or choice of mine, I drifted, as\r\nthousands of other women have drifted, into the life which set a mark on\r\nme for the rest of my days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you surprised at the ignorance which this confession reveals?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, who have your solicitors to inform you of legal remedies and\r\nyour newspapers, circulars, and active friends to sound the praises of\r\ncharitable institutions continually in your ears--you, who possess these\r\nadvantages, have no idea of the outer world of ignorance in which your\r\nlost fellow-creatures live. They know nothing (unless they are rogues\r\naccustomed to prey on society) of your benevolent schemes to help them.\r\nThe purpose of public charities, and the way to discover and apply to\r\nthem, ought to be posted at the corner of every street. What do we know\r\nof public dinners and eloquent sermons and neatly printed circulars?\r\nEvery now and then the ease of some forlorn creature (generally of a\r\nwoman) who has committed suicide, within five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk, perhaps, of\r\nan institution which would have opened its doors to her, appears in the\r\nnewspapers, shocks you dreadfully, and is then forgotten again. Take as\r\nmuch pains to make charities and asylums known among the people without\r\nmoney as are taken to make a new play, a new journal, or a new medicine\r\nknown among the people with money and you will save many a lost creature\r\nwho is perishing now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will forgive and understand me if I say no more of this period of\r\nmy life. Let me pass to the new incident in my career which brought me\r\nfor the second time before the public notice in a court of law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSad as my experience has been, it has not taught me to think ill\r\nof human nature. I had found kind hearts to feel for me in my\r\nformer troubles; and I had friends--faithful, self-denying, generous\r\nfriends--among my sisters in adversity now. One of these poor women (she\r\nhas gone, I am glad to think, from the world that used her so hardly)\r\nespecially attracted my sympathies. She was the gentlest, the most\r\nunselfish creature I have ever met with. We lived together like sisters.\r\nMore than once in the dark hours when the thought of self-destruction\r\ncomes to a desperate woman, the image of my poor devoted friend, left\r\nto suffer alone, rose in my mind and restrained me. You will hardly\r\nunderstand it, but even we had our happy days. When she or I had a few\r\nshillings to spare, we used to offer one another little presents, and\r\nenjoy our simple pleasure in giving and receiving as keenly as if we had\r\nbeen the most reputable women living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day I took my friend into a shop to buy her a ribbon--only a bow\r\nfor her dress. She was to choose it, and I was to pay for it, and it was\r\nto be the prettiest ribbon that money could buy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shop was full; we had to wait a little before we could be served.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext to me, as I stood at the counter with my companion, was a\r\ngaudily-dressed woman, looking at some handkerchiefs. The handkerchiefs\r\nwere finely embroidered, but the smart lady was hard to please. She\r\ntumbled them up disdainfully in a heap, and asked for other specimens\r\nfrom the stock in the shop. The man, in clearing the handkerchiefs\r\nout of the way, suddenly missed one. He was quite sure of it, from a\r\npeculiarity in the embroidery which made the handkerchief especially\r\nnoticeable. I was poorly dressed, and I was close to the handkerchiefs.\r\nAfter one look at me he shouted to the superintendent: \xe2\x80\x98Shut the door!\r\nThere is a thief in the shop!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe door was closed; the lost handkerchief was vainly sought for on\r\nthe counter and on the floor. A robbery had been committed; and I was\r\naccused of being the thief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say nothing of what I felt--I will only tell you what happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was searched, and the handkerchief was discovered on me. The woman\r\nwho had stood next to me, on finding herself threatened with discovery,\r\nhad no doubt contrived to slip the stolen handkerchief into my pocket.\r\nOnly an accomplished thief could have escaped detection in that way\r\nwithout my knowledge. It was useless, in the face of the facts, to\r\ndeclare my innocence. I had no character to appeal to. My friend tried\r\nto speak for me; but what was she? Only a lost woman like myself. My\r\nlandlady\xe2\x80\x99s evidence in favor of my honesty produced no effect; it\r\nwas against her that she let lodgings to people in my position. I was\r\nprosecuted, and found guilty. The tale of my disgrace is now complete,\r\nMr. Holmcroft. No matter whether I was innocent or not, the shame of it\r\nremains--I have been imprisoned for theft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matron of the prison was the next person who took an interest in\r\nme. She reported favorably of my behavior to the authorities and when I\r\nhad served my time (as the phrase was among us) she gave me a letter\r\nto the kind friend and guardian of my later years--to the lady who is\r\ncoming here to take me back with her to the Refuge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom this time the story of my life is little more than the story of a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s vain efforts to recover her lost place in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matron, on receiving me into the Refuge, frankly acknowledged that\r\nthere were terrible obstacles in my way. But she saw that I was sincere,\r\nand she felt a good woman\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy and compassion for me. On my side,\r\nI did not shrink from beginning the slow and weary journey back again\r\nto a reputable life from the humblest starting-point--from domestic\r\nservice. After first earning my new character in the Refuge, I\r\nobtained a trial in a respectable house. I worked hard, and worked\r\nuncomplainingly; but my mother\xe2\x80\x99s fatal legacy was against me from the\r\nfirst. My personal appearance excited remark; my manners and habits were\r\nnot the manners and habits of the women among whom my lot was cast. I\r\ntried one place after another--always with the same results. Suspicion\r\nand jealousy I could endure; but I was defenseless when curiosity\r\nassailed me in its turn. Sooner or later inquiry led to discovery.\r\nSometimes the servants threatened to give warning in a body--and I was\r\nobliged to go. Sometimes, where there was a young man in the family,\r\nscandal pointed at me and at him--and again I was obliged to go. If\r\nyou care to know it, Miss Roseberry can tell you the story of those sad\r\ndays. I confided it to her on the memorable night when we met in the\r\nFrench cottage; I have no heart repeat it now. After a while I wearied\r\nof the hopeless struggle. Despair laid its hold on me--I lost all hope\r\nin the mercy of God. More than once I walked to one or other of the\r\nbridges, and looked over the parapet at the river, and said to myself\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Other women have done it: why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saved me at that time, Mr. Gray--as you have saved me since. I was\r\none of your congregation when you preached in the chapel of the Refuge\r\nYou reconciled others besides me to our hard pilgrimage. In their name\r\nand in mine, sir, I thank you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forget how long it was after the bright day when you comforted and\r\nsustained us that the war broke out between France and Germany. But I\r\ncan never forget the evening when the matron sent for me into her own\r\nroom and said, \xe2\x80\x98My dear, your life here is a wasted life. If you have\r\ncourage enough left to try it, I can give you another chance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI passed through a month of probation in a London hospital. A week\r\nafter that I wore the red cross of the Geneva Convention--I was\r\nappointed nurse in a French ambulance. When you first saw me, Mr.\r\nHolmcroft, I still had my nurse\xe2\x80\x99s dress on, hidden from you and from\r\neverybody under a gray cloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what the next event was; you know how I entered this house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not tried to make the worst of my trials and troubles in telling\r\nyou what my life has been. I have honestly described it for what it was\r\nwhen I met with Miss Roseberry--a life without hope. May you never know\r\nthe temptation that tried me when the shell struck its victim in the\r\nFrench cottage! There she lay--dead! _Her_ name was untainted. _Her_\r\nfuture promised me the reward which had been denied to the honest\r\nefforts of a penitent woman. My lost place in the world was offered back\r\nto me on the one condition that I stooped to win it by a fraud. I had\r\nno prospect to look forward to; I had no friend near to advise me and to\r\nsave me; the fairest years of my womanhood had been wasted in the\r\nvain struggle to recover my good name. Such was my position when the\r\npossibility of personating Miss Roseberry first forced itself on my\r\nmind. Impulsively, recklessly--wickedly, if you like--I seized the\r\nopportunity, and let you pass me through the German lines under Miss\r\nRoseberry\xe2\x80\x99s name. Arrived in England, having had time to reflect, I made\r\nmy first and last effort to draw back before it was too late. I went to\r\nthe Refuge, and stopped on the opposite side of the street, looking at\r\nit. The old hopeless life of irretrievable disgrace confronted me as I\r\nfixed my eyes on the familiar door; the horror of returning to that life\r\nwas more than I could force myself to endure. An empty cab passed me at\r\nthe moment. The driver held up his hand. In sheer despair I stopped\r\nhim, and when he said \xe2\x80\x98Where to?\xe2\x80\x99 in sheer despair again I answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mablethorpe House.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what I have suffered in secret since my own successful deception\r\nestablished me under Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s care I shall say nothing. Many things\r\nwhich must have surprised you in my conduct are made plain to you by\r\nthis time. You must have noticed long since that I was not a happy\r\nwoman. Now you know why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy confession is made; my conscience has spoken at last. You are\r\nreleased from your promise to me--you are free. Thank Mr. Julian Gray if\r\nI stand here self-accused of the offense, that I have committed, before\r\nthe man whom I have wronged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. SENTENCE IS PRONOUNCED ON HER.\r\n\r\nIT was done. The last tones of her voice died away in silence.\r\n\r\nHer eyes still rested on Horace. After hearing what he had heard could\r\nhe resist that gentle, pleading look? Would he forgive her? A while\r\nsince Julian had seen tears on his cheeks, and had believed that he felt\r\nfor her. Why was he now silent? Was it possible that he only felt for\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\nFor the last time--at the crisis of her life--Julian spoke for her. He\r\nhad never loved her as he loved her at that moment; it tried even his\r\ngenerous nature to plead her cause with Horace against himself. But he\r\nhad promised her, without reserve, all the help that her truest friend\r\ncould offer. Faithfully and manfully he redeemed his promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorace!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHorace slowly looked up. Julian rose and approached him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has told you to thank _me_, if her conscience has spoken. Thank\r\nthe noble nature which answered when I called upon it! Own the priceless\r\nvalue of a woman who can speak the truth. Her heartfelt repentance is\r\na joy in heaven. Shall it not plead for her on earth? Honor her, if you\r\nare a Christian! Feel for her, if you are a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited. Horace never answered him.\r\n\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned tearfully on Julian. _His_ heart was the heart that\r\nfelt for her! _His_ words were the words which comforted and pardoned\r\nher! When she looked back again at Horace, it was with an effort. His\r\nlast hold on her was lost. In her inmost mind a thought rose unbidden--a\r\nthought which was not to be repressed. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I ever have loved this man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe advanced a step toward him; it was not possible, even yet, to\r\ncompletely forgot the past. She held out her hand.\r\n\r\nHe rose on his side--without looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore we part forever,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you take my hand as a\r\ntoken that you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. He half lifted his hand. The next moment the generous\r\nimpulse died away in him. In its place came the mean fear of what might\r\nhappen if he trusted himself to the dangerous fascination of her touch.\r\nHis hand dropped again at his side; he turned away quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t forgive her!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nWith that horrible confession--without even a last look at her--he left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when he opened the door Julian\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for him burst\r\nits way through all restraints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI pity you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the words escaped him he looked back at Mercy. She had turned aside\r\nfrom both of them--she had retired to a distant part of the library The\r\nfirst bitter foretaste of what was in store for her when she faced the\r\nworld again had come to her from Horace! The energy which had sustained\r\nher thus far quailed before the dreadful prospect--doubly dreadful to\r\na woman--of obloquy and contempt. She sank on her knees before a little\r\ncouch in the darkest corner of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cO Christ, have mercy on me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n That was her prayer--no more.\r\n\r\nJulian followed her. He waited a little. Then his kind hand touched her;\r\nhis friendly voice fell consolingly on her ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, poor wounded heart! Beautiful, purified soul, God\xe2\x80\x99s angels\r\nrejoice over you! Take your place among the noblest of God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised her as he spoke. All her heart went out to him. She caught\r\nhis hand--she pressed it to her bosom; she pressed it to her lips--then\r\ndropped it suddenly, and stood before him trembling like a frightened\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d was all she could say. \xe2\x80\x9cI was so lost and lonely--and you\r\nare so good to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to leave him. It was useless--her strength was gone; she\r\ncaught at the head of the couch to support herself. He looked at her.\r\nThe confession of his love was just rising to his lips--he looked again,\r\nand checked it. No, not at that moment; not when she was helpless and\r\nashamed; not when her weakness might make her yield, only to regret it\r\nat a later time. The great heart which had spared her and felt for her\r\nfrom the first spared her and felt for her now.\r\n\r\nHe, too, left her--but not without a word at parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think of your future life just yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nsomething to propose when rest and quiet have restored you.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened\r\nthe nearest door--the door of the dining-room--and went out.\r\n\r\nThe servants engaged in completing the decoration of the dinner-table\r\nnoticed, when \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Julian\xe2\x80\x9d entered the room, that his eyes were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbrighter than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked (they remarked) like a man who \xe2\x80\x9cexpected\r\ngood news.\xe2\x80\x9d They were inclined to suspect--though he was certainly\r\nrather young for it--that her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s nephew was in a fair way of\r\npreferment in the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercy seated herself on the couch.\r\n\r\nThere are limits, in the physical organization of man, to the action of\r\npain. When suffering has reached a given point of intensity the nervous\r\nsensibility becomes incapable of feeling more. The rule of Nature,\r\nin this respect, applies not only to sufferers in the body, but to\r\nsufferers in the mind as well. Grief, rage, terror, have also their\r\nappointed limits. The moral sensibility, like the nervous sensibility,\r\nreaches its period of absolute exhaustion, and feels no more.\r\n\r\nThe capacity for suffering in Mercy had attained its term. Alone in the\r\nlibrary, she could feel the physical relief of repose; she could\r\nvaguely recall Julian\xe2\x80\x99s parting words to her, and sadly wonder what they\r\nmeant--she could do no more.\r\n\r\nAn interval passed; a brief interval of perfect rest.\r\n\r\nShe recovered herself sufficiently to be able to look at her watch and\r\nto estimate the lapse of time that might yet pass before Julian returned\r\nto her as he had promised. While her mind was still languidly following\r\nthis train of thought she was disturbed by the ringing of a bell in the\r\nhall, used to summon the servant whose duties were connected with that\r\npart of the house. In leaving the library, Horace had gone out by the\r\ndoor which led into the hall, and had failed to close it. She plainly\r\nheard the bell--and a moment later (more plainly still) she heard Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s voice!\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet. Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s letter was still in the pocket of\r\nher apron--the letter which imperatively commanded her to abstain from\r\nmaking the very confession that had just passed her lips! It was near\r\nthe dinner hour, and the library was the favorite place in which the\r\nmistress of the house and her guests assembled at that time. It was no\r\nmatter of doubt; it was an absolute certainty that Lady Janet had only\r\nstopped in the hall on her way into the room.\r\n\r\nThe alternative for Mercy lay between instantly leaving the library by\r\nthe dining-room door--or remaining where she was, at the risk of being\r\nsooner or later compelled to own that she had deliberately disobeyed\r\nher benefactress. Exhausted by what she had already suffered, she stood\r\ntrembling and irresolute, incapable of deciding which alternative she\r\nshould choose.\r\n\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s voice, clear and resolute, penetrated into the room. She\r\nwas reprimanding the servant who had answered the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your duty in my house to look after the lamps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it my duty to pay you your wages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I find the light in the hall dim, and the wick of that lamp\r\nsmoking? I have not failed in my duty to You. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me find you\r\nfailing again in your duty to Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Never had Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s voice sounded so sternly in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s ear as it\r\nsounded now. If she spoke with that tone of severity to a servant who\r\nhad neglected a lamp, what had her adopted daughter to expect when she\r\ndiscovered that her entreaties and her commands had been alike set at\r\ndefiance?)\r\n\r\nHaving administered her reprimand, Lady Janet had not done with the\r\nservant yet. She had a question to put to him next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Miss Roseberry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the library, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy returned to the couch. She could stand no longer; she had not even\r\nresolution enough left to lift her eyes to the door.\r\n\r\nLady Janet came in more rapidly than usual. She advanced to the couch,\r\nand tapped Mercy playfully on the cheek with two of her fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lazy child! Not dressed for dinner? Oh, fie, fie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone was as playfully affectionate as the action which had\r\naccompanied her words. In speechless astonishment Mercy looked up at\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAlways remarkable for the taste and splendor of her dress, Lady Janet\r\nhad on this occasion surpassed herself. There she stood revealed in her\r\ngrandest velvet, her richest jewelry, her finest lace--with no one to\r\nentertain at the dinner-table but the ordinary members of the circle at\r\nMablethorpe House. Noticing this as strange to begin with, Mercy further\r\nobserved, for the first time in her experience, that Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\navoided meeting hers. The old lady took her place companionably on the\r\ncouch; she ridiculed her \xe2\x80\x9clazy child\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d plain dress, without an ornament\r\nof any sort on it, with her best grace; she affectionately put her arm\r\nround Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and rearranged with her own hand the disordered\r\nlocks of Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s hair--but the instant Mercy herself looked at her, Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s eyes discovered something supremely interesting in the familiar\r\nobjects that surrounded her on the library walls.\r\n\r\nHow were these changes to be interpreted? To what possible conclusion\r\ndid they point?\r\n\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s profounder knowledge of human nature, if Julian had been\r\npresent, might have found a clew to the mystery. _He_ might have\r\nsurmised (incredible as it was) that Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s timidity before Lady Janet\r\nwas fully reciprocated by Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s timidity before Mercy. It\r\nwas even so. The woman whose immovable composure had conquered Grace\r\nRoseberry\xe2\x80\x99s utmost insolence in the hour of her triumph--the woman\r\nwho, without once flinching, had faced every other consequence of her\r\nresolution to ignore Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s true position in the house--quailed for the\r\nfirst time when she found herself face to face with the very person for\r\nwho m she had suffered and sacrificed so much. She had shrunk from the\r\nmeeting with Mercy, as Mercy had shrunk from the meeting with _her_. The\r\nsplendor of her dress meant simply that, when other excuses for delaying\r\nthe meeting downstairs had all been exhausted, the excuse of a long,\r\nand elaborate toilet had been tried next. Even the moments occupied in\r\nreprimanding the servant had been moments seized on as the pretext for\r\nanother delay. The hasty entrance into the room, the nervous assumption\r\nof playfulness in language and manner, the evasive and wandering eyes,\r\nwere all referable to the same cause. In the presence of others, Lady\r\nJanet had successfully silenced the protest of her own inbred delicacy\r\nand inbred sense of honor. In the presence of Mercy, whom she loved with\r\na mother\xe2\x80\x99s love--in the presence of Mercy, for whom she had stooped to\r\ndeliberate concealment of the truth--all that was high and noble in the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s nature rose in her and rebuked her. What will the daughter of\r\nmy adoption, the child of my first and last experience of maternal love,\r\nthink of me, now that I have made myself an accomplice in the fraud of\r\nwhich she is ashamed? How can I look her in the face, when I have not\r\nhesitated, out of selfish consideration for my own tranquillity, to\r\nforbid that frank avowal of the truth which her finer sense of duty had\r\nspontaneously bound her to make? Those were the torturing questions in\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s mind, while her arm was wound affectionately round Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaist, while her fingers were busying themselves familiarly with the\r\narrangement of Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s hair. Thence, and thence only, sprang the impulse\r\nwhich set her talking, with an uneasy affectation of frivolity, of any\r\ntopic within the range of conversation, so long as it related to the\r\nfuture, and completely ignored the present and the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe winter here is unendurable,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet began. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nthinking, Grace, about what we had better do next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy started. Lady Janet had called her \xe2\x80\x9cGrace.\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Janet was still\r\ndeliberately assuming to be innocent of the faintest suspicion of the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed her ladyship, affecting to misunderstand Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovement, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not to go up now and dress. There is no time, and I\r\nam quite ready to excuse you. You are a foil to me, my dear. You have\r\nreached the perfection of shabbiness. Ah! I remember when I had my whims\r\nand fancies too, and when I looked well in anything I wore, just as you\r\ndo. No more of that. As I was saying, I have been thinking and planning\r\nwhat we are to do. We really can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here. Cold one day, and hot the\r\nnext--what a climate! As for society, what do we lose if we go away?\r\nThere is no such thing as society now. Assemblies of well-dressed mobs\r\nmeet at each other\xe2\x80\x99s houses, tear each other\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, tread on each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s toes. If you are particularly lucky, you sit on the staircase,\r\nyou get a tepid ice, and you hear vapid talk in slang phrases all\r\nround you. There is modern society. If we had a good opera, it would be\r\nsomething to stay in London for. Look at the programme for the season\r\non that table--promising as much as possible on paper, and performing\r\nas little as possible on the stage. The same works, sung by the same\r\nsingers year after year, to the same stupid people--in short the dullest\r\nmusical evenings in Europe. No! the more I think of it, the more plainly\r\nI perceive that there is but one sensible choice before us: we must go\r\nabroad. Set that pretty head to work; choose north or south, east or\r\nwest; it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to me. Where shall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy looked at her quickly as she put the question.\r\n\r\nLady Janet, more quickly yet, looked away at the programme of the\r\nopera-house. Still the same melancholy false pretenses! still the same\r\nuseless and cruel delay! Incapable of enduring the position now forced\r\nupon her, Mercy put her hand into the pocket of her apron, and drew from\r\nit Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your ladyship forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, in faint, faltering tones,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I venture on a painful subject? I hardly dare acknowledge--\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nspite of her resolution to speak out plainly, the memory of past love\r\nand past kindness prevailed with her; the next words died away on her\r\nlips. She could only hold up the letter.\r\n\r\nLady Janet declined to see the letter. Lady Janet suddenly became\r\nabsorbed in the arrangement of her bracelets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you daren\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge, you foolish child!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou daren\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge that you are tired of this dull house. My dear!\r\nI am entirely of your opinion--I am weary of my own magnificence; I long\r\nto be living in one snug little room, with one servant to wait on me.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what we will do. We will go to Paris, in the first place.\r\nMy excellent Migliore, prince of couriers, shall be the only person in\r\nattendance. He shall take a lodging for us in one of the unfashionable\r\nquarters of Paris. We will rough it, Grace (to use the slang phrase),\r\nmerely for a change. We will lead what they call a \xe2\x80\x98Bohemian life.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nknow plenty of writers and painters and actors in Paris--the liveliest\r\nsociety in the world, my dear, until one gets tired of them. We will\r\ndine at the restaurant, and go to the play, and drive about in shabby\r\nlittle hired carriages. And when it begins to get monotonous (which it\r\nis only too sure to do!) we will spread our wings and fly to Italy, and\r\ncheat the winter in that way. There is a plan for you! Migliore is in\r\ntown. I will send to him this evening, and we will start to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy made another effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entreat your ladyship to pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cI have something\r\nserious to say. I am afraid--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand. You are afraid of crossing the Channel, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to acknowledge it. Pooh! The passage barely lasts two hours; we\r\nwill shut ourselves up in a private cabin. I will send at once--the\r\ncourier may be engaged. Ring the bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet, I must submit to my hard lot. I cannot hope to associate\r\nmyself again with any future plans of yours--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you are afraid of our \xe2\x80\x98Bohemian life\xe2\x80\x99 in Paris? Observe this,\r\nGrace! If there is one thing I hate more than another, it is \xe2\x80\x98an old\r\nhead on young shoulders.\xe2\x80\x99 I say no more. Ring the bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis cannot go on, Lady Janet! No words can say how unworthy I feel of\r\nyour kindness, how ashamed I am--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honor, my dear, I agree with you. You _ought_ to be ashamed, at\r\nyour age, of making me get up to ring the bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer obstinacy was immovable; she attempted to rise from the couch. But\r\none choice was left to Mercy. She anticipated Lady Janet, and rang the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nThe man-servant came in. He had his little letter-tray in his hand, with\r\na card on it, and a sheet of paper beside the card, which looked like an\r\nopen letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know where my courier lives when he is in London?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lady\r\nJanet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend one of the grooms to him on horseback; I am in a hurry. The\r\ncourier is to come here without fail to-morrow morning--in time for the\r\ntidal train to Paris. You understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got there? Anything for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Miss Roseberry, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he answered, the man handed the card and the open letter to Mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady is waiting in the morning-room, miss. She wished me to say she\r\nhas time to spare, and she will wait for you if you are not ready yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving delivered his message in those terms, he withdrew.\r\n\r\nMercy read the name on the card. The matron had arrived! She looked at\r\nthe letter next. It appeared to be a printed circular, with some lines\r\nin pencil added on the empty page. Printed lines and written lines\r\nswam before her eyes. She felt, rather than saw, Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nsteadily and suspiciously fixed on her. With the matron\xe2\x80\x99s arrival the\r\nforedoomed end of the flimsy false pretenses and the cruel delays had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of yours, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I acquainted with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appear to be agitated. Does your visitor bring bad news? Is there\r\nanything that I can do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can add--immeasurably add, madam--to all your past kindness, if you\r\nwill only bear with me and forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear with you and forgive you? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try to explain. Whatever else you may think of me, Lady Janet,\r\nfor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t think me ungrateful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet held up her hand for silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dislike explanations,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody ought to know that\r\nbetter than you. Perhaps the lady\xe2\x80\x99s letter will explain for you. Why\r\nhave you not looked at it yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in great trouble, madam, as you noticed just now--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any objection to my knowing who your visitor is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lady Janet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me look at her card, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy gave the matron\xe2\x80\x99s card to Lady Janet, as she had given the\r\nmatron\xe2\x80\x99s telegram to Horace.\r\n\r\nLady Janet read the name on the card--considered--decided that it was\r\na name quite unknown to her--and looked next at the address: \xe2\x80\x9cWestern\r\nDistrict Refuge, Milburn Road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady connected with a Refuge?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ncalling here by appointment--if I remember the servant\xe2\x80\x99s message? A\r\nstrange time to choose, if she has come for a subscription!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused. Her brow contracted; her face hardened. A word from her\r\nwould now have brought the interview to its inevitable end, and she\r\nrefused to speak the word. To the last moment she persisted in ignoring\r\nthe truth! Placing the card on the couch at her side, she pointed with\r\nher long yellow-white forefinger to the printed letter lying side by\r\nside with her own letter on Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to read it, or not?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nMercy lifted her eyes, fast filling with tears, to Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I beg that your ladyship will read it for me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said--and placed\r\nthe matron\xe2\x80\x99s letter in Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a printed circular announcing a new development in the charitable\r\nwork of the Refuge. Subscribers were informed that it had been decided\r\nto extend the shelter and the training of the institution (thus far\r\ndevoted to fallen women alone) so as to include destitute and helpless\r\nchildren found wandering in the streets. The question of the number\r\nof children to be thus rescued and protected was left dependent, as a\r\nmatter of course, on the bounty of the friends of the Refuge, the cost\r\nof the maintenance of each child being stated at the lowest\r\npossible rate. A list of influential persons who had increased their\r\nsubscriptions so as to cover the cost, and a brief statement of the\r\nprogress already made with the new work, completed the appeal, and\r\nbrought the circular to its end.\r\n\r\nThe lines traced in pencil (in the matron\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting) followed on the\r\nblank page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour letter tells me, my dear, that you would like--remembering your\r\nown childhood--to be employed when you return among us in saving other\r\npoor children left helpless on the world. Our circular will inform you\r\nthat I am able to meet your wishes. My first errand this evening in\r\nyour neighborhood was to take charge of a poor child--a little girl--who\r\nstands sadly in need of our care. I have ventured to bring her with me,\r\nthinking she might help to reconcile you to the coming change in your\r\nlife. You will find us both waiting to go back with you to the old home.\r\nI write this instead of saying it, hearing from the servant that you are\r\nnot alone, and being unwilling to intrude myself, as a stranger, on the\r\nlady of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet read the penciled lines, as she had read the printed\r\nsentences, aloud. Without a word of comment she laid the letter where\r\nshe had laid the card; and, rising from her seat, stood for a moment\r\nin stern silence, looking at Mercy. The sudden change in her which the\r\nletter had produced--quietly as it had taken place--was terrible to\r\nsee. On the frowning brow, in the flashing eyes, on the hardened lips,\r\noutraged love and outraged pride looked down on the lost woman, and\r\nsaid, as if in words, You have roused us at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that letter means anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit means you are about to\r\nleave my house. There can be but one reason for your taking such a step\r\nas that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the only atonement I can make, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see another letter on your lap. Is it my letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Horace Holmcroft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you told Horace Holmcroft--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lady Janet--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me. Have you told Horace Holmcroft what my letter\r\npositively forbade you to communicate, either to him or to any living\r\ncreature? I want no protestations and excuses. Answer me instantly, and\r\nanswer in one word--Yes, or No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot even that haughty language, not even those pitiless tones, could\r\nextinguish in Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s heart the sacred memories of past kindness and\r\npast love. She fell on her knees--her outstretched hands touched Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s dress. Lady Janet sharply drew her dress away, and sternly\r\nrepeated her last words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes? or No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had owned it at last! To this end Lady Janet had submitted to Grace\r\nRoseberry; had offended Horace Holmcroft; had stooped, for the first\r\ntime in her life, to concealments and compromises that degraded her.\r\nAfter all that she had sacrificed and suffered, there Mercy knelt at\r\nher feet, self-convicted of violating her commands, trampling on her\r\nfeelings, deserting her house! And who was the woman who had done this?\r\nThe same woman who had perpetrated the fraud, and who had persisted in\r\nthe fraud until her benefactress had descended to become her accomplice.\r\nThen, and then only, she had suddenly discovered that it was her sacred\r\nduty to tell the truth!\r\n\r\nIn proud silence the great lady met the blow that had fallen on her. In\r\nproud silence she turned her back on her adopted daughter and walked to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nMercy made her last appeal to the kind friend whom she had offended--to\r\nthe second mother whom she had loved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet! Lady Janet! Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me without a word. Oh, madam, try\r\nto feel for me a little! I am returning to a life of humiliation--the\r\nshadow of my old disgrace is falling on me once more. We shall never\r\nmeet again. Even though I have not deserved it, let my repentance plead\r\nwith you! Say you forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Janet turned round on the threshold of the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never forgive ingratitude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo back to the Refuge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened and closed on her. Mercy was alone again in the room.\r\n\r\nUnforgiven by Horace, unforgiven by Lady Janet! She put her hands to her\r\nburning head and tried to think. Oh, for the cool air of the night!\r\nOh, for the friendly shelter of the Refuge! She could feel those sad\r\nlongings in her: it was impossible to think.\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell--and shrank back the instant she had done it. Had\r\n_she_ any right to take that liberty? She ought to have thought of it\r\nbefore she rang. Habit--all habit. How many hundreds of times she had\r\nrung the bell at Mablethorpe House!\r\n\r\nThe servant came in. She amazed the man--she spoke to him so timidly:\r\nshe even apologized for troubling him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to disturb you. Will you be so kind as to say to the lady\r\nthat I am ready for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait to give that message,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice behind them, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil you hear\r\nthe bell rung again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercy looked round in amazement. Julian had returned to the library by\r\nthe dining-room door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. THE LAST TRIAL.\r\n\r\nTHE servant left them together. Mercy spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gray!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy have you delayed my message? If you knew\r\nall, you would know that it is far from being a kindness to me to keep\r\nme in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advanced closer to her--surprised by her words, alarmed by her looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas any one been here in my absence?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet has been here in your absence. I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it--my heart\r\nfeels crushed--I can bear no more. Let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBriefly as she had replied, she had said enough. Julian\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge\r\nof Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s character told him what had happened. His face showed\r\nplainly that he was disappointed as well as distressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped to have been with you when you and my aunt met, and to have\r\nprevented this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, she will atone for all that she\r\nmay have harshly and hastily done when she has had time to think. Try\r\nnot to regret it, if she has made your hard sacrifice harder still. She\r\nhas only raised you the higher--she has additionally ennobled you and\r\nendeared you in my estimation. Forgive me if I own this in plain words.\r\nI cannot control myself--I feel too strongly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt other times Mercy might have heard the coming avowal in his tones,\r\nmight have discovered it in his eyes. As it was, her delicate insight\r\nwas dulled, her fine perception was blunted. She held out her hand to\r\nhim, feeling a vague conviction that he was kinder to her than ever--and\r\nfeeling no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must thank you for the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as life is\r\nleft, my gratitude will be a part of my life. Let me go. While I can\r\nstill control myself, let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to leave him, and ring the bell. He held her hand firmly, and\r\ndrew her closer to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Refuge?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHome again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to hear it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t call the\r\nRefuge your home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else is it? Where else can I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here to tell you. I said, if you remember, I had something\r\nto propose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt the fervent pressure of his hand; she saw the mounting\r\nenthusiasm flashing in his eyes. Her weary mind roused itself a little.\r\nShe began to tremble under the electric influence of his touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething to propose?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there to propose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask you a question on my side. What have you done to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I have done: it is your work,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, humbly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nreturn to it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI return to it for the last time; I return to it with a purpose which\r\nyou will soon understand. You have abandoned your marriage engagement;\r\nyou have forfeited Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s love; you have ruined all your worldly\r\nprospects; you are now returning, self-devoted, to a life which you have\r\nyourself described as a life without hope. And all this you have done\r\nof your own free-will--at a time when you are absolutely secure of your\r\nposition in the house--for the sake of speaking the truth. Now tell me,\r\nis a woman who can make that sacrifice a woman who will prove unworthy\r\nof the trust if a man places in her keeping his honor and his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe understood him at last. She broke away from him with a cry. She\r\nstood with her hands clasped, trembling and looking at him.\r\n\r\nHe gave her no time to think. The words poured from his lips without\r\nconscious will or conscious effort of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy, from the first moment when I saw you I loved you! You are free;\r\nI may own it; I may ask you to be my wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew back from him further and further, with a wild imploring\r\ngesture of her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of what you are saying! think of what you\r\nwould sacrifice! It cannot, must not be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face darkened with a sudden dread. His head fell on his breast. His\r\nvoice sank so low that she could barely hear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten something,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve reminded me of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ventured back a little nearer to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I offended you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have enlightened me. I had forgotten that it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow, because I love you, that you should love me in return.\r\nSay that it is so, Mercy, and I leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint tinge of color rose on her face--then left it again paler than\r\never. Her eyes looked downward timidly under the eager gaze that he\r\nfastened on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _can_ I say so?\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, simply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the woman in my\r\nplace whose heart could resist you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe eagerly advanced; he held out his arms to her in breathless,\r\nspeechless joy. She drew back from him once more with a look that\r\nhorrified him--a look of blank despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I fit to be your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cMust I remind you of what you\r\nowe to your high position, your spotless integrity, your famous name?\r\nThink of all that you have done for me, and then think of the\r\nblack ingratitude of it if I ruin you for life by consenting to our\r\nmarriage--if I selfishly, cruelly, wickedly, drag you down to the level\r\nof a woman like me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI raise you to _my_ level when I make you my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake do me justice! Don\xe2\x80\x99t refer me to the world and its\r\nopinions. It rests with you, and you alone, to make the misery or the\r\nhappiness of my life. The world! Good God! what can the world give me in\r\nexchange for You?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands imploringly; the tears flowed fast over her\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, have pity on my weakness!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cKindest, best of men, help\r\nme to do my hard duty toward you! It is so hard, after all that I have\r\nsuffered--when my heart is yearning for peace and happiness and love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She checked herself, shuddering at the words that had escaped her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember how Mr. Holmcroft has used me! Remember how Lady Janet has\r\nleft me! Remember what I have told you of my life! The scorn of every\r\ncreature you know would strike at you through me. No! no! no! Not a word\r\nmore. Spare me! pity me! leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice failed her; sobs choked her utterance. He sprang to her and\r\ntook her in his arms. She was incapable of resisting him; but there\r\nwas no yielding in her. Her head lay on his bosom, passive--horribly\r\npassive, like the head of a corpse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy! My darling! We will go away--we will leave England--we will take\r\nrefuge among new people in a new world--I will change my name--I will\r\nbreak with relatives, friends, everybody. Anything, anything, rather\r\nthan lose you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head slowly and looked at him.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly released her; he reeled back like a man staggered by a\r\nblow, and dropped into a chair. Before she had uttered a word he saw\r\nthe terrible resolution in her face--Death, rather than yield to her own\r\nweakness and disgrace him.\r\n\r\nShe stood with her hands lightly clasped in front of her. Her grand head\r\nwas raised; her soft gray eyes shone again undimmed by tears. The storm\r\nof emotion had swept over her and had passed away A sad tranquillity was\r\nin her face; a gentle resignation was in her voice. The calm of a martyr\r\nwas the calm that confronted him as she spoke her last words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman who has lived my life, a woman who has suffered what I have\r\nsuffered, may love you--as _I_ love you--but she must not be your wife.\r\n_That_ place is too high above her. Any other place is too far below her\r\nand below you.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and advancing to the bell, gave the signal\r\nfor her departure. That done, she slowly retraced her steps until she\r\nstood at Julian\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\nTenderly she lifted his head and laid it for a moment on her bosom.\r\nSilently she stooped and touched his forehead with her lips. All the\r\ngratitude that filled her heart and all the sacrifice that rent it were\r\nin those two actions--so modestly, so tenderly performed! As the last\r\nlingering pressure of her fingers left him, Julian burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe servant answered the bell. At the moment he opened the door a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s voice was audible in the hall speaking to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the child go in,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will wait here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child appeared--the same forlorn little creature who had reminded\r\nMercy of her own early years on the day when she and Horace Holmcroft\r\nhad been out for their walk.\r\n\r\nThere was no beauty in this child; no halo of romance brightened the\r\ncommonplace horror of her story. She came cringing into the room,\r\nstaring stupidly at the magnificence all round her--the daughter of the\r\nLondon streets! the pet creation of the laws of political economy! the\r\nsavage and terrible product of a worn-out system of government and of a\r\ncivilization rotten to its core! Cleaned for the first time in her life,\r\nfed sufficiently for the first time in her life, dressed in clothes\r\ninstead of rags for the first time in her life, Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sister in\r\nadversity crept fearfully over the beautiful carpet, and stopped\r\nwonder-struck before the marbles of an inlaid table--a blot of mud on\r\nthe splendor of the room.\r\n\r\nMercy turned from Julian to meet the child. The woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart, hungering\r\nin its horrible isolation for something that it might harmlessly love,\r\nwelcomed the rescued waif of the streets as a consolation sent from God.\r\nShe caught the stupefied little creature up in her arms. \xe2\x80\x9cKiss me!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered, in the reckless agony of the moment. \xe2\x80\x9cCall me sister!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nchild stared, vacantly. Sister meant nothing to her mind but an older\r\ngirl who was strong enough to beat her.\r\n\r\nShe put the child down again, and turned for a last look at the man\r\nwhose happiness she had wrecked--in pity to _him_.\r\n\r\nHe had never moved. His head was down; his face was hidden. She went\r\nback to hi m a few steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe others have gone from me without one kind word. Can _you_ forgive\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand to her without looking up. Sorely as she had\r\nwounded him, his generous nature understood her. True to her from the\r\nfirst, _he_ was true to her still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless and comfort you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in broken tones. \xe2\x80\x9cThe earth holds\r\nno nobler woman than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knelt and kissed the kind hand that pressed hers for the last time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end with this world,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a better\r\nworld to come!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she rose, and went back to the child. Hand in hand\r\nthe two citizens of the Government of God--outcasts of the government of\r\nMan--passed slowly down the length of the room. Then out into the hall.\r\nThen out into the night. The heavy clang of the closing door tolled the\r\nknell of their departure. They were gone.\r\n\r\nBut the orderly routine of the house--inexorable as death--pursued its\r\nappointed course. As the clock struck the hour the dinner-bell rang. An\r\ninterval of a minute passed, and marked the limit of delay. The butler\r\nappeared at the dining-room door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner is served, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian looked up. The empty room met his eyes. Something white lay on\r\nthe carpet close by him. It was her handkerchief--wet with her tears. He\r\ntook it up and pressed it to his lips. Was that to be the last of her?\r\nHad she left him forever?\r\n\r\nThe native energy of the man, arming itself with all the might of his\r\nlove, kindled in him again. No! While life was in him, while time was\r\nbefore him, there was the hope of winning her yet!\r\n\r\nHe turned to the servant, reckless of what his face might betray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Lady Janet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the dining-room, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reflected for a moment. His own influence had failed. Through what\r\nother influence could he now hope to reach her? As the question crossed\r\nhis mind the light broke on him. He saw the way back to her--through the\r\ninfluence of Lady Janet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer ladyship is waiting, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulian entered the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE:\r\n\r\nCONTAINING SELECTIONS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE OF MISS GRACE ROSEBERRY\r\nAND MR. HORACE HOLMCROFT; TO WHICH ARE ADDED EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF\r\nTHE REVEREND JULIAN GRAY.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nFrom MR. HORACE HOLMCROFT to MISS GRACE ROSEBERRY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI HASTEN to thank you, dear Miss Roseberry, for your last kind letter,\r\nreceived by yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s mail from Canada. Believe me, I appreciate your\r\ngenerous readiness to pardon and forget what I so rudely said to you at\r\na time when the arts of an adventuress had blinded me to the truth. In\r\nthe grace which has forgiven me I recognize the inbred sense of justice\r\nof a true lady. Birth and breeding can never fail to assert themselves:\r\nI believe in them, thank God, more firmly than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me to keep you informed of the progress of Julian Gray\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfatuation, and of the course of conduct pursued toward him by Mercy\r\nMerrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had not favored me by explaining your object, I might have felt\r\nsome surprise at receiving from a lady in your position such a request\r\nas this. But the motives by which you describe yourself as being\r\nactuated are beyond dispute. The existence of Society, as you truly\r\nsay, is threatened by the present lamentable prevalence of Liberal\r\nideas throughout the length and breadth of the land. We can only hope\r\nto protect ourselves against impostors interested in gaining a position\r\namong persons of our rank by becoming in some sort (unpleasant as it may\r\nbe) familiar with the arts by which imposture too frequently succeeds.\r\nIf we wish to know to what daring lengths cunning can go, to what\r\npitiable self-delusion credulity can consent, we must watch the\r\nproceedings--even while we shrink from them--of a Mercy Merrick and a\r\nJulian Gray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn taking up my narrative again where my last letter left off, I must\r\nventure to set you right on one point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertain expressions which have escaped your pen suggest to me that you\r\nblame Julian Gray as the cause of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s regrettable visit to the\r\nRefuge the day after Mercy Merrick had left her house. This is not quite\r\ncorrect. Julian, as you will presently see, has enough to answer for\r\nwithout being held responsible for errors of judgment in which he has\r\nhad no share. Lady Janet (as she herself told me) went to the Refuge of\r\nher own free-will to ask Mercy Merrick\xe2\x80\x99s pardon for the language which\r\nshe had used on the previous day. \xe2\x80\x98I passed a night of such misery as\r\nno words can describe\xe2\x80\x99--this, I assure you, is what her ladyship really\r\nsaid to me--\xe2\x80\x98thinking over what my vile pride and selfishness and\r\nobstinacy had made me say and do. I would have gone down on my knees to\r\nbeg her pardon if she would have let me. My first happy moment was when\r\nI won her consent to come and visit me sometimes at Mablethorpe House.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will, I am sure, agree with me that such extravagance as this is to\r\nbe pitied rather than blamed. How sad to see the decay of the faculties\r\nwith advancing age! It is a matter of grave anxiety to consider how much\r\nlonger poor Lady Janet can be trusted to manage her own affairs. I shall\r\ntake an opportunity of touching on the matter delicately when I next see\r\nher lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am straying from my subject. And--is it not strange?--I am writing to\r\nyou as confidentially as if we were old friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo return to Julian Gray. Innocent of instigating his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nvisit to the Refuge, he is guilty of having induced her to go there for\r\nthe second time the day after I had dispatched my last letter to you.\r\nLady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s object on this occasion was neither more nor less than to\r\nplead her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s cause as humble suitor for the hand of Mercy Merrick.\r\nImagine the descent of one of the oldest families in England inviting an\r\nadventuress in a Refuge to honor a clergyman of the Church of England by\r\nbecoming his wife! In what times do we live! My dear mother shed tears\r\nof shame when she heard of it. How you would love and admire my mother!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dined at Mablethorpe House, by previous appointment, on the day when\r\nLady Janet returned from her degrading errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 I said, waiting, of course, until the servant was out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 Lady Janet answered, \xe2\x80\x98Julian was quite right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Quite right in what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In saying that the earth holds no nobler woman than Mercy Merrick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Has she refused him again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She has refused him again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thank God!\xe2\x80\x99 I felt it fervently, and I said it fervently. Lady Janet\r\nlaid down her knife and fork, and fixed one of her fierce looks on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It may not be your fault, Horace,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98if your nature is\r\nincapable of comprehending what is great and generous in other natures\r\nhigher than yours. But the least you can do is to distrust your\r\nown capacity of appreciation. For the future keep your opinions (on\r\nquestions which you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand) modestly to yourself. I have a\r\ntenderness for you for your father\xe2\x80\x99s sake; and I take the most favorable\r\nview of your conduct toward Mercy Merrick. I humanely consider it the\r\nconduct of a fool.\xe2\x80\x99 (Her own words, Miss Roseberry. I assure you\r\nonce more, her own words.) \xe2\x80\x98But don\xe2\x80\x99t trespass too far on my\r\nindulgence--don\xe2\x80\x99t insinuate again that a woman who is good enough (if\r\nshe died this night) to go to heaven, is _not_ good enough to be my\r\nnephew\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expressed to you my conviction a little way back that it was doubtful\r\nwhether poor Lady Janet would be much longer competent to manage her own\r\naffairs. Perhaps you thought me hasty then? What do you think now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was, of course, useless to reply seriously to the extraordinary\r\nreprimand that I had received. Besides, I was really shocked by a decay\r\nof principle which proceeded but too plainly from decay of the mental\r\npowers. I made a soothing and respectful reply, and I was favored in\r\nreturn with some account of what had really happened at the Refuge. My\r\nmother and my sisters were disgusted when I repeated the particulars to\r\nthem. You will be disgusted too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe interesting penitent (expecting Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s visit) was, of course,\r\ndiscovered in a touching domestic position! She had a foundling baby\r\nasleep on her lap; and she was teaching the alphabet to an ugly little\r\nvagabond girl whose acquaintance she had first made in the street. Just\r\nthe sort of artful _tableau vivant_ to impose on an old lady--was it\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand what followed, when Lady Janet opened her\r\nmatrimonial negotiation. Having perfected herself in her part, Mercy\r\nMerrick, to do her justice, was not the woman to play it badly. The\r\nmost magnanimous sentiments flowed from her lips. She declared that her\r\nfuture life was devoted to acts of charity, typified, of course, by the\r\nfoundling infant and the ugly little girl. However she might personally\r\nsuffer, whatever might be the sacrifice of her own feelings--observe how\r\nartfully this was put, to insinuate that she was herself in love with\r\nhim!--she could not accept from Mr. Julian Gray an honor of which she\r\nwas unworthy. Her gratitude to him and her interest in him alike forbade\r\nher to compromise his brilliant future by consenting to a marriage which\r\nwould degrade him in the estimation of all his friends. She thanked him\r\n(with tears); she thanked Lady Janet (with more tears); but she dare\r\nnot, in the interests of _his_ honor and _his_ happiness, accept the\r\nhand that he offered to her. God bless and comfort him; and God help her\r\nto bear with her hard lot!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe object of this contemptible comedy is plain enough to my mind. She\r\nis simply holding off (Julian, as you know, is a poor man) until the\r\ninfluence of Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion is backed by the opening of Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s purse. In one word--Settlements! But for the profanity of the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s language, and the really lamentable credulity of the poor old\r\nlady, the whole thing would make a fit subject for a burlesque.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the saddest part of the story is still to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn due course of time the lady\xe2\x80\x99s decision was communicated to Julian\r\nGray. He took leave of his senses on the spot. Can you believe it?--he\r\nhas resigned his curacy! At a time when the church is thronged every\r\nSunday to hear him preach, this madman shuts the door and walks out of\r\nthe pulpit. Even Lady Janet was not far enough gone in folly to abet\r\nhim in this. She remonstrated, like the rest of his friends. Perfectly\r\nuseless! He had but one answer to everything they could say: \xe2\x80\x98My career\r\nis closed.\xe2\x80\x99 What stuff!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will ask, naturally enough, what this perverse man is going to do\r\nnext. I don\xe2\x80\x99t scruple to say that he is bent on committing suicide.\r\nPray do not be alarmed! There is no fear of the pistol, the rope, or the\r\nriver. Julian is simply courting death--within the limits of the law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is strong language, I know. You shall hear what the facts are, and\r\njudge for yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving resigned his curacy, his next proceeding was to offer his\r\nservices, as volunteer, to a new missionary enterprise on the West\r\nCoast of Africa. The persons at the head of the mission proved, most\r\nfortunately, to have a proper sense of their duty. Expressing their\r\nconviction of the value of Julian\xe2\x80\x99s assistance in the most handsome\r\nterms, they made it nevertheless a condition of entertaining his\r\nproposal that he should submit to examination by a competent medical\r\nman. After some hesitation he consented to this. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s report\r\nwas conclusive. In Julian\xe2\x80\x99s present state of health the climate of West\r\nAfrica would in all probability kill him in three months\xe2\x80\x99 time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoiled in his first attempt, he addressed himself next to a London\r\nMission. Here it was impossible to raise the question of climate, and\r\nhere, I grieve to say, he has succeeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is now working--in other words, he is now deliberately risking his\r\nlife--in the Mission to Green Anchor Fields. The district known by this\r\nname is situated in a remote part of London, near the Thames. It is\r\nnotoriously infested by the most desperate and degraded set of wretches\r\nin the whole metropolitan population, and it is so thickly inhabited\r\nthat it is hardly ever completely free from epidemic disease. In\r\nthis horrible place, and among these dangerous people, Julian is now\r\nemploying himself from morning to night. None of his old friends ever\r\nsee him. Since he joined the Mission he has not even called on Lady\r\nJanet Roy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy pledge is redeemed--the facts are before you. Am I wrong in taking\r\nmy gloomy view of the prospect? I cannot forget that this unhappy man\r\nwas once my friend, and I really see no hope for him in the future.\r\nDeliberately self-exposed to the violence of ruffians and the outbreak\r\nof disease, who is to extricate him from his shocking position? The one\r\nperson who can do it is the person whose association with him would be\r\nhis ruin--Mercy Merrick. Heaven only knows what disasters it may be my\r\npainful duty to communicate to you in my next letter!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so kind as to ask me to tell you something about myself and my\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have very little to say on either head. After what I have\r\nsuffered--my feelings trampled on, my confidence betrayed--I am as\r\nyet hardly capable of deciding what I shall do. Returning to my old\r\nprofession--to the army--is out of the question, in these leveling days,\r\nwhen any obscure person who can pass an examination may call himself my\r\nbrother officer, and may one day, perhaps, command me as my superior in\r\nrank. If I think of any career, it is the career of diplomacy. Birth\r\nand breeding have not quite disappeared as essential qualifications in\r\n_that_ branch of the public service. But I have decided nothing as yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother and sisters, in the event of your returning to England,\r\ndesire me to say that it will afford them the greatest pleasure to make\r\nyour acquaintance. Sympathizing with me, they do not forget what you too\r\nhave suffered. A warm welcome awaits you when you pay your first visit\r\nat our house. Most truly yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHORACE HOLMCROFT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFrom MISS GRACE ROSEBERRY to MR. HORACE HOLMCROFT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. HOLMCROFT--I snatch a few moments from my other avocations to\r\nthank you for your most interesting and delightful letter. How well you\r\ndescribe, how accurately you judge! If Literature stood a little higher\r\nas a profession, I should almost advise you--but no! if you entered\r\nLiterature, how could _you_ associate with the people whom you would be\r\nlikely to meet?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween ourselves, I always thought Mr. Julian Gray an overrated man.\r\nI will not say he has justified my opinion. I will only say I pity him.\r\nBut, dear Mr. Holmcroft, how can you, with your sound judgment, place\r\nthe sad alternatives now before him on the same level? To die in Green\r\nAnchor Fields, or to fall into the clutches of that vile wretch--is\r\nthere any comparison between the two? Better a thousand times die at the\r\npost of duty than marry Mercy Merrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I have written the creature\xe2\x80\x99s name, I may add--so as to have all the\r\nsooner done with the subject--that I shall look with anxiety for your\r\nnext letter. Do not suppose that I feel the smallest curiosity about\r\nthis degraded and designing woman. My interest in her is purely\r\nreligious. To persons of my devout turn of mind she is an awful warning.\r\nWhen I feel Satan near me--it will be _such_ a means of grace to think\r\nof Mercy Merrick!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Lady Janet! I noticed those signs of mental decay to which you\r\nso feelingly allude at the last interview I had with her in Mablethorpe\r\nHouse. If you can find an opportunity, will you say that I wish her\r\nwell, here and hereafter? and will you please add that I do not omit to\r\nremember her in my prayers?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is just a chance of my visiting England toward the close of\r\nthe autumn. My fortunes have changed since I wrote last. I have been\r\nreceived as reader and companion by a lady who is the wife of one of\r\nour high judicial functionaries in this part of the world. I do not take\r\nmuch interest in _him_; he is what they call a \xe2\x80\x98self-made man.\xe2\x80\x99 His wife\r\nis charming. Besides being a person of highly intellectual tastes, she\r\nis greatly her husband\xe2\x80\x99s superior--as you will understand when I tell\r\nyou that she is related to the Gommerys of Pommery; _not_ the Pommerys\r\nof Gommery, who (as your knowledge of our old families will inform you)\r\nonly claim kindred with the younger branch of that ancient race.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the elegant and improving companionship which I now enjoy I should\r\nfeel quite happy but for one drawback. The climate of Canada is not\r\nfavorable to my kind patroness, and her medical advisers recommend\r\nher to winter in London. In this event, I am to have t he privilege of\r\naccompanying her. Is it necessary to add that my first visit will be\r\npaid at your house? I feel already united by sympathy to your mother and\r\nyour sisters. There is a sort of freemasonry among gentlewomen, is\r\nthere not? With best thanks and remembrances, and many delightful\r\nanticipations of your next letter, believe me, dear Mr. Holmcroft,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGRACE ROSEBERRY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFrom MR. HORACE HOLMCROFT to MISS GRACE ROSEBERRY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MISS ROSEBERRY--Pray excuse my long silence. I have waited for\r\nmail after mail, in the hope of being able to send you some good news\r\nat last. It is useless to wait longer. My worst forebodings have been\r\nrealized: my painful duty compels me to write a letter which will\r\nsurprise and shock you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me describe events in their order as they happened. In this way I\r\nmay hope to gradually prepare your mind for what is to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout three weeks after I wrote to you last, Julian Gray paid the\r\npenalty of his headlong rashness. I do not mean that he suffered any\r\nactual violence at the hands of the people among whom he had cast his\r\nlot. On the contrary, he succeeded, incredible as it may appear,\r\nin producing a favorable impression on the ruffians about him. As I\r\nunderstand it, they began by respecting his courage in venturing among\r\nthem alone; and they ended in discovering that he was really interested\r\nin promoting their welfare. It is to the other peril, indicated in my\r\nlast letter, that he has fallen a victim--the peril of disease. Not long\r\nafter he began his labors in the district fever broke out. We only heard\r\nthat Julian had been struck down by the epidemic when it was too late to\r\nremove him from the lodging that he occupied in the neighborhood. I\r\nmade inquiries personally the moment the news reached us. The doctor in\r\nattendance refused to answer for his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this alarming state of things poor Lady Janet, impulsive and\r\nunreasonable as usual, insisted on leaving Mablethorpe House and taking\r\nup her residence near her nephew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinding it impossible to persuade her of the folly of removing from\r\nhome and its comforts at her age, I felt it my duty to accompany her.\r\nWe found accommodation (such as it was) in a river-side inn, used by\r\nship-captains and commercial travelers. I took it on myself to provide\r\nthe best medical assistance, Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s insane prejudices against\r\ndoctors impelling her to leave this important part of the arrangements\r\nentirely in my hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is needless to weary you by entering into details on the subject of\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s illness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fever pursued the ordinary course, and was characterized by the\r\nusual intervals of delirium and exhaustion succeeding each other.\r\nSubsequent events, which it is, unfortunately, necessary to relate to\r\nyou, leave me no choice but to dwell (as briefly as possible) on the\r\npainful subject of the delirium. In other cases the wanderings of\r\nfever-stricken people present, I am told, a certain variety of range. In\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s case they were limited to one topic. He talked incessantly\r\nof Mercy Merrick. His invariable petition to his medical attendants\r\nentreated them to send for her to nurse him. Day and night that one idea\r\nwas in his mind, and that one name on his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctors naturally made inquiries as to this absent person. I was\r\nobliged (in confidence) to state the circumstances to them plainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe eminent physician whom I had called in to superintend the treatment\r\nbehaved admirably. Though he has risen from the lower order of the\r\npeople, he has, strange to say, the instincts of a gentleman. He\r\nthoroughly understood our trying position, and felt all the importance\r\nof preventing such a person as Mercy Merrick from seizing the\r\nopportunity of intruding herself at the bedside. A soothing prescription\r\n(I have his own authority for saying it) was all that was required to\r\nmeet the patient\xe2\x80\x99s case. The local doctor, on the other hand, a young\r\nman (and evidently a red-hot radical), proved to be obstinate, and,\r\nconsidering his position, insolent as well. \xe2\x80\x98I have nothing to do with\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s character, and with your opinion of it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to me. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave only, to the best of my judgment, to point out to you the likeliest\r\nmeans of saving the patient\xe2\x80\x99s life. Our art is at the end of its\r\nresources. Send for Mercy Merrick, no matter who she is or what she is.\r\nThere is just a chance--especially if she proves to be a sensible person\r\nand a good nurse--that he may astonish you all by recognizing her. In\r\nthat case only, his recovery is probable. If you persist in disregarding\r\nhis entreaties, if you let the delirium go on for four-and-twenty hours\r\nmore, he is a dead man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet was, most unluckily, present when this impudent opinion was\r\ndelivered at the bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeed I tell you the sequel? Called upon to choose between the course\r\nindicated by a physician who is making his five thousand a year, and who\r\nis certain of the next medical baronetcy, and the advice volunteered by\r\nan obscure general practitioner at the East End of London, who is\r\nnot making his five hundred a year--need I stop to inform you of her\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s decision? You know her; and you will only too well understand\r\nthat her next proceeding was to pay a third visit to the Refuge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hours later--I give you my word of honor I am not\r\nexaggerating--Mercy Merrick was established at Julian\xe2\x80\x99s bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe excuse, of course, was that it was her duty not to let any private\r\nscruples of her own stand in the way, when a medical authority had\r\ndeclared that she might save the patient\xe2\x80\x99s life. You will not be\r\nsurprised to hear that I withdrew from the scene. The physician followed\r\nmy example--after having written his soothing prescription, and having\r\nbeen grossly insulted by the local practitioner\xe2\x80\x99s refusing to make use\r\nof it. I went back in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s carriage. He spoke most feelingly and\r\nproperly. Without giving any positive opinion, I could see that he\r\nhad abandoned all hope of Julian\xe2\x80\x99s recovery. \xe2\x80\x98We are in the hands of\r\nProvidence, Mr. Holmcroft;\xe2\x80\x99 those were his last words as he set me down\r\nat my mother\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have hardly the heart to go on. If I studied my own wishes, I should\r\nfeel inclined to stop here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me, at least, hasten to the end. In two or three days\xe2\x80\x99 time I\r\nreceived my first intelligence of the patient and his nurse. Lady\r\nJanet informed me that he had recognized her. When I heard this I felt\r\nprepared for what was to come. The next report announced that he was\r\ngaining strength, and the next that he was out of danger. Upon this\r\nLady Janet returned to Mablethorpe House. I called there a week ago--and\r\nheard that he had been removed to the sea-side. I called yesterday--and\r\nreceived the latest information from her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s own lips. My pen\r\nalmost refuses to write it. Mercy Merrick has consented to marry him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn outrage on Society--that is how my mother and my sisters view\r\nit; that is how _you_ will view it too. My mother has herself struck\r\nJulian\xe2\x80\x99s name off her invitation-list. The servants have their orders,\r\nif he presumes to call: \xe2\x80\x98Not at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am unhappily only too certain that I am correct in writing to you\r\nof this disgraceful marriage as of a settled thing. Lady Janet went the\r\nlength of showing me the letters--one from Julian, the other from the\r\nwoman herself. Fancy Mercy Merrick in correspondence with Lady Janet\r\nRoy! addressing her as \xe2\x80\x98My dear Lady Janet,\xe2\x80\x99 and signing, \xe2\x80\x98Yours\r\naffectionately!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not the patience to read either of the letters through. Julian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntone is the tone of a Socialist; in my opinion his bishop ought to be\r\ninformed of it. As for _her_ she plays her part just as cleverly with\r\nher pen as she played it with her tongue. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot disguise from myself\r\nthat I am wrong in yielding.... Sad forebodings fill my mind when I\r\nthink of the future.... I feel as if the first contemptuous look that\r\nis cast at my husband will destroy _my_ happiness, though it may not\r\ndisturb _him_.... As long as I was parted from him I could control my\r\nown weakness, I could accept my hard lot. But how can I resist him after\r\nhaving watched for weeks at his bedside; after having seen his first\r\nsmile, and heard his first grateful words t o me while I was slowly\r\nhelping him back to life?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the tone which she takes through four closely written pages\r\nof nauseous humility and clap-trap sentiment! It is enough to make one\r\ndespise women. Thank God, there is the contrast at hand to remind me of\r\nwhat is due to the better few among the sex. I feel that my mother and\r\nmy sisters are doubly precious to me now. May I add, on the side of\r\nconsolation, that I prize with hardly inferior gratitude the privilege\r\nof corresponding with _you?_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell for the present. I am too rudely shaken in my most cherished\r\nconvictions, I am too depressed and disheartened, to write more. All\r\ngood wishes go with you, dear Miss Roseberry, until we meet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost truly yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHORACE HOLMCROFT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nExtracts from the DIARY of THE REVEREND JULIAN GRAY.\r\n\r\nFIRST EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n....\xe2\x80\x9cA month to-day since we were married! I have only one thing to say:\r\nI would cheerfully go through all that I have suffered to live this one\r\nmonth over again. I never knew what happiness was until now. And better\r\nstill, I have persuaded Mercy that it is all her doing. I have scattered\r\nher misgivings to the winds; she is obliged to submit to evidence, and\r\nto own that she can make the happiness of my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe go back to London to-morrow. She regrets leaving the tranquil\r\nretirement of this remote sea-side place--she dreads change. I care\r\nnothing for it. It is all one to me where I go, so long as my wife is\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSECOND EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first cloud has risen. I entered the room unexpectedly just now,\r\nand found her in tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith considerable difficulty I persuaded her to tell me what had\r\nhappened. Are there any limits to the mischief that can be done by the\r\ntongue of a foolish woman? The landlady at my lodgings is the woman, in\r\nthis case. Having no decided plans for the future as yet, we returned\r\n(most unfortunately, as the event has proved) to the rooms in London\r\nwhich I inhabited in my bachelor days. They are still mine for six weeks\r\nto come, and Mercy was unwilling to let me incur the expense of taking\r\nher to a hotel. At breakfast this morning I rashly congratulated myself\r\n(in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s hearing) on finding that a much smaller collection than\r\nusual of letters and cards had accumulated in my absence. Breakfast\r\nover, I was obliged to go out. Painfully sensitive, poor thing, to\r\nany change in my experience of the little world around me which it is\r\npossible to connect with the event of my marriage, Mercy questioned the\r\nlandlady, in my absence, about the diminished number of my visitors and\r\nmy correspondents. The woman seized the opportunity of gossiping\r\nabout me and my affairs, and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s quick perception drew the right\r\nconclusion unerringly. My marriage has decided certain wise heads of\r\nfamilies on discontinuing their social relations with me. The facts,\r\nunfortunately, speak for themselves. People who in former years\r\nhabitually called upon me and invited me--or who, in the event of my\r\nabsence, habitually wrote to me at this season--have abstained with a\r\nremarkable unanimity from calling, inviting, or writing now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been sheer waste of time--to say nothing of its also\r\nimplying a want of confidence in my wife--if I had attempted to set\r\nthings right by disputing Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion. I could only satisfy her\r\nthat not so much as the shadow of disappointment or mortification rested\r\non my mind. In this way I have, to some extent, succeeded in composing\r\nmy poor darling. But the wound has been inflicted, and the wound is\r\nfelt. There is no disguising that result. I must face it boldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrifling as this incident is in my estimation, it has decided me on one\r\npoint already. In shaping my future course I am now resolved to act on\r\nmy own convictions--in preference to taking the well-meant advice of\r\nsuch friends as are still left to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my little success in life has been gained in the pulpit. I am what\r\nis termed a popular preacher--but I have never, in my secret self, felt\r\nany exultation in my own notoriety, or any extraordinary respect for the\r\nmeans by which it has been won. In the first place, I have a very low\r\nidea of the importance of oratory as an intellectual accomplishment.\r\nThere is no other art in which the conditions of success are so easy of\r\nattainment; there is no other art in the practice of which so much that\r\nis purely superficial passes itself off habitually for something that\r\nclaims to be profound. Then, again, how poor it is in the results which\r\nit achieves! Take my own case. How often (for example) have I thundered\r\nwith all my heart and soul against the wicked extravagance of dress\r\namong women--against their filthy false hair and their nauseous powders\r\nand paints! How often (to take another example) have I denounced the\r\nmercenary and material spirit of the age--the habitual corruptions and\r\ndishonesties of commerce, in high places and in low! What good have I\r\ndone? I have delighted the very people whom it was my object to rebuke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a charming sermon!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98More eloquent than ever!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I used to dread\r\nthe sermon at the other church--do you know, I quite look forward to it\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99 That is the effect I produce on Sunday. On Monday the women are\r\noff to the milliners to spend more money than ever; the city men are off\r\nto business to make more money than ever--while my grocer, loud in\r\nmy praises in his Sunday coat, turns up his week-day sleeves and\r\nadulterates his favorite preacher\xe2\x80\x99s sugar as cheerfully as usual!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often, in past years, felt the objections to pursuing my career\r\nwhich are here indicated. They were bitterly present to my mind when I\r\nresigned my curacy, and they strongly influence me now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am weary of my cheaply won success in the pulpit. I am weary of\r\nsociety as I find it in my time. I felt some respect for myself, and\r\nsome heart and hope in my works among the miserable wretches in Green\r\nAnchor Fields. But I can not, and must not, return among them: I have no\r\nright, _now_, to trifle with my health and my life. I must go back to my\r\npreaching, or I must leave England. Among a primitive people, away\r\nfrom the cities--in the far and fertile West of the great American\r\ncontinent--I might live happily with my wife, and do good among my\r\nneighbors, secure of providing for our wants out of the modest little\r\nincome which is almost useless to me here. In the life which I thus\r\npicture to myself I see love, peace, health, and duties and occupations\r\nthat are worthy of a Christian man. What prospect is before me if I\r\ntake the advice of my friends and stay here? Work of which I am weary,\r\nbecause I have long since ceased to respect it; petty malice that\r\nstrikes at me through my wife, and mortifies and humiliates her, turn\r\nwhere she may. If I had only myself to think of, I might defy the worst\r\nthat malice can do. But I have Mercy to think of--Mercy, whom I love\r\nbetter than my own life! Women live, poor things, in the opinions of\r\nothers. I have had one warning already of what my wife is likely to\r\nsuffer at the hands of my \xe2\x80\x98friends\xe2\x80\x99--Heaven forgive me for misusing the\r\nword! Shall I deliberately expose her to fresh mortifications?--and this\r\nfor the sake of returning to a career the rewards of which I no longer\r\nprize? No! We will both be happy--we will both be free! God is merciful,\r\nNature is kind, Love is true, in the New World as well as the Old. To\r\nthe New World we will go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHIRD EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know whether I have done right or wrong. I mentioned yesterday\r\nto Lady Janet the cold reception of me on my return to London, and the\r\npainful sense of it felt by my wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt looks at the matter from her own peculiar point of view,\r\nand makes light of it accordingly. \xe2\x80\x98You never did, and never will,\r\nunderstand Society, Julian,\xe2\x80\x99 said her ladyship. \xe2\x80\x98These poor stupid\r\npeople simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. They are waiting to be told by a\r\nperson of distinction whether they are, or are not, to recognize your\r\nmarriage. In plain English, they are waiting to be led by Me. Consider\r\nit done. I will lead them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought my aunt was joking. The event of to-day has shown me that she\r\nis terribly in earnest. Lady Janet has issued invitations for one of her\r\ngrand balls at Mablethorpe House; and sh e has caused the report to be\r\ncirculated everywhere that the object of the festival is \xe2\x80\x98to celebrate\r\nthe marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Julian Gray!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI at first refused to be present. To my amazement, however, Mercy sides\r\nwith my aunt. She reminds me of all that we both owe to Lady Janet; and\r\nshe has persuaded me to alter my mind. We are to go to the ball--at my\r\nwife express request!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe meaning of this, as I interpret it, is that my poor love is still\r\npursued in secret by the dread that my marriage has injured me in the\r\ngeneral estimation. She will suffer anything, risk anything, believe\r\nanything, to be freed from that one haunting doubt. Lady Janet\r\npredicts a social triumph; and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s despair--not my wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconviction--accepts the prophecy. As for me, I am prepared for the\r\nresult. It will end in our going to the New World, and trying Society in\r\nits infancy, among the forests and the plains. I shall quietly prepare\r\nfor our departure, and own what I have done at the right time--that is\r\nto say, when the ball is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFOURTH EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have met with the man for my purpose--an old college friend of mine,\r\nnow partner in a firm of ship-owners, largely concerned in emigration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of their vessels sails for America, from the port of London, in\r\na fortnight, touching at Plymouth. By a fortunate coincidence, Lady\r\nJanet\xe2\x80\x99s ball takes place in a fortnight. I see my way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelped by the kindness of my friend, I have arranged to have a cabin\r\nkept in reserve, on payment of a small deposit. If the ball ends (as I\r\nbelieve it will) in new mortifications for Mercy--do what they may, I\r\ndefy them to mortify _me_--I have only to say the word by telegraph, and\r\nwe shall catch the ship at Plymouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the effect it will have when I break the news to her, but I am\r\nprepared with my remedy. The pages of my diary, written in past years,\r\nwill show plainly enough that it is not _she_ who is driving me away\r\nfrom England. She will see the longing in me for other work and other\r\nscenes expressing itself over and over again long before the time when\r\nwe first met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFIFTH EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy\xe2\x80\x99s ball dress--a present from kind Lady Janet--is finished. I was\r\nallowed to see the first trial, or preliminary rehearsal, of this work\r\nof art. I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least understand the merits of silk and lace; but\r\none thing I know--my wife will be the most beautiful woman at the ball.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same day I called on Lady Janet to thank her, and encountered a new\r\nrevelation of the wayward and original character of my dear old aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was on the point of tearing up a letter when I went into her room.\r\nSeeing me, she suspended her purpose and handed me the letter. It was in\r\nMercy\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting. Lady Janet pointed to a passage on the last page.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell your wife, with my love,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that I am the most obstinate\r\nwoman of the two. I positively refuse to read her, as I positively\r\nrefuse to listen to her, whenever she attempts to return to that one\r\nsubject. Now give me the letter back.\xe2\x80\x99 I gave it back, and saw it torn\r\nup before my face. The \xe2\x80\x98one subject\xe2\x80\x99 prohibited to Mercy as sternly as\r\never is still the subject of the personation of Grace Roseberry! Nothing\r\ncould have been more naturally introduced, or more delicately managed,\r\nthan my wife\xe2\x80\x99s brief reference to the subject. No matter. The reading\r\nof the first line was enough. Lady Janet shut her eyes and destroyed the\r\nletter--Lady Janet is determined to live and die absolutely ignorant of\r\nthe true story of \xe2\x80\x98Mercy Merrick.\xe2\x80\x99 What unanswerable riddles we are! Is\r\nit wonderful if we perpetually fail to understand one another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSIXTH EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe morning after the ball.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done and over. Society has beaten Lady Janet. I have neither\r\npatience nor time to write at length of it. We leave for Plymouth by the\r\nafternoon express.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were rather late in arriving at the ball. The magnificent rooms were\r\nfilling fast. Walking through them with my wife, she drew my attention\r\nto a circumstance which I had not noticed at the time. \xe2\x80\x98Julian,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98look round among the lades, and tell me if you see anything\r\nstrange.\xe2\x80\x99 As I looked round the band began playing a waltz. I observed\r\nthat a few people only passed by us to the dancing-room. I noticed next\r\nthat of those few fewer still were young. At last it burst upon me. With\r\ncertain exceptions (so rare as to prove the rule), there were no\r\nyoung girls at Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s ball. I took Mercy at once back to the\r\nreception-room. Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s face showed that she, too, was aware of\r\nwhat had happened. The guests were still arriving. We received the\r\nmen and their wives, the men and their mothers, the men and their\r\ngrandmothers--but, in place of their unmarried daughters, elaborate\r\nexcuses, offered with a shameless politeness wonderful to see. Yes! This\r\nwas how the matrons in high life had got over the difficulty of meeting\r\nMrs. Julian Gray at Lady Janet\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me do strict justice to every one. The ladies who _were_ present\r\nshowed the needful respect for their hostess. They did their duty--no,\r\noverdid it, is perhaps the better phrase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really had no adequate idea of the coarseness and rudeness which have\r\nfiltered their way through society in these later times until I saw the\r\nreception accorded to my wife. The days of prudery and prejudice are\r\ndays gone by. Excessive amiability and excessive liberality are the\r\ntwo favorite assumptions of the modern generation. To see the women\r\nexpressing their liberal forgetfulness of my wifely misfortunes, and the\r\nmen their amiable anxiety to encourage her husband; to hear the same set\r\nphrases repeated in every room--\xe2\x80\x98So charmed to make your acquaintance,\r\nMrs. Gray; so _much_ obliged to dear Lady Janet for giving us this\r\nopportunity!--Julian, old man, what a beautiful creature! I envy you;\r\nupon my honor, I envy you!\xe2\x80\x99--to receive this sort of welcome, emphasized\r\nby obtrusive hand-shakings, sometimes actually by downright kissings of\r\nmy wife, and then to look round and see that not one in thirty of these\r\nvery people had brought their unmarried daughters to the ball, was,\r\nI honestly believe, to see civilized human nature in its basest\r\nconceivable aspect. The New World may have its disappointments in store\r\nfor us, but it cannot possibly show us any spectacle so abject as the\r\nspectacle which we witnessed last night at my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s ball.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Janet marked her sense of the proceeding adopted by her guests\r\nby leaving them to themselves. Her guests remained and supped heartily\r\nnotwithstanding. They all knew by experience that there were no stale\r\ndishes and no cheap wines at Mablethorpe House. They drank to the end of\r\nthe bottle, and they ate to the last truffle in the dish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy and I had an interview with my aunt upstairs before we left. I\r\nfelt it necessary to state plainly my resolution to leave England. The\r\nscene that followed was so painful that I cannot prevail on myself to\r\nreturn to it in these pages. My wife is reconciled to our departure; and\r\nLady Janet accompanies us as far as Plymouth--these are the results. No\r\nwords can express my sense of relief, now that it is all settled. The\r\none sorrow I shall carry away with me from the shores of England will be\r\nthe sorrow of parting with dear, warm-hearted Lady Janet. At her age it\r\nis a parting for life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo closes my connection with my own country. While I have Mercy by my\r\nside I face the unknown future, certain of carrying my happiness\r\nwith me, go where I may. We shall find five hundred adventurers like\r\nourselves when we join the emigrant ship, for whom their native land has\r\nno occupation and no home. Gentlemen of the Statistical Department, add\r\ntwo more to the number of social failures produced by England in the\r\nyear of our Lord eighteen hundred and seventy-one--Julian Gray and Mercy\r\nMerrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The New Magdalen, by Wilkie Collins\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE NEW MAGDALEN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1623-0.txt or 1623-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/2/1623/\r\n\r\nProduced by James Rusk\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
