Still there is so much\r\nobscurity in the Indian traditions, and so much confusion in the Indian names,\r\nas to render some explanation useful.\r\n\r\nFew men exhibit greater diversity, or, if we may so express it, greater\r\nantithesis of character, than the native warrior of North America. In war, he\r\nis daring, boastful, cunning, ruthless, self-denying, and self-devoted; in\r\npeace, just, generous, hospitable, revengeful, superstitious, modest, and\r\ncommonly chaste. These are qualities, it is true, which do not distinguish all\r\nalike; but they are so far the predominating traits of these remarkable people\r\nas to be characteristic.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that the Aborigines of the American continent have an\r\nAsiatic origin. There are many physical as well as moral facts which\r\ncorroborate this opinion, and some few that would seem to weigh against it.\r\n\r\nThe color of the Indian, the writer believes, is peculiar to himself, and while\r\nhis cheek-bones have a very striking indication of a Tartar origin, his eyes\r\nhave not. Climate may have had great influence on the former, but it is\r\ndifficult to see how it can have produced the substantial difference which\r\nexists in the latter. The imagery of the Indian, both in his poetry and in his\r\noratory, is oriental; chastened, and perhaps improved, by the limited range of\r\nhis practical knowledge. He draws his metaphors from the clouds, the seasons,\r\nthe birds, the beasts, and the vegetable world. In this, perhaps, he does no\r\nmore than any other energetic and imaginative race would do, being compelled to\r\nset bounds to fancy by experience; but the North American Indian clothes his\r\nideas in a dress which is different from that of the African, and is oriental\r\nin itself. His language has the richness and sententious fullness of the\r\nChinese. He will express a phrase in a word, and he will qualify the meaning of\r\nan entire sentence by a syllable; he will even convey different significations\r\nby the simplest inflections of the voice.\r\n\r\nPhilologists have said that there are but two or three languages, properly\r\nspeaking, among all the numerous tribes which formerly occupied the country\r\nthat now composes the United States. They ascribe the known difficulty one\r\npeople have to understand another to corruptions and dialects. The writer\r\nremembers to have been present at an interview between two chiefs of the Great\r\nPrairies west of the Mississippi, and when an interpreter was in attendance who\r\nspoke both their languages. The warriors appeared to be on the most friendly\r\nterms, and seemingly conversed much together; yet, according to the account of\r\nthe interpreter, each was absolutely ignorant of what the other said. They were\r\nof hostile tribes, brought together by the influence of the American\r\ngovernment; and it is worthy of remark, that a common policy led them both to\r\nadopt the same subject. They mutually exhorted each other to be of use in the\r\nevent of the chances of war throwing either of the parties into the hands of\r\nhis enemies. Whatever may be the truth, as respects the root and the genius of\r\nthe Indian tongues, it is quite certain they are now so distinct in their words\r\nas to possess most of the disadvantages of strange languages; hence much of the\r\nembarrassment that has arisen in learning their histories, and most of the\r\nuncertainty which exists in their traditions.\r\n\r\nLike nations of higher pretensions, the American Indian gives a very different\r\naccount of his own tribe or race from that which is given by other people. He\r\nis much addicted to overestimating his own perfections, and to undervaluing\r\nthose of his rival or his enemy; a trait which may possibly be thought\r\ncorroborative of the Mosaic account of the creation.\r\n\r\nThe whites have assisted greatly in rendering the traditions of the Aborigines\r\nmore obscure by their own manner of corrupting names. Thus, the term used in\r\nthe title of this book has undergone the changes of Mahicanni, Mohicans, and\r\nMohegans; the latter being the word commonly used by the whites. When it is\r\nremembered that the Dutch (who first settled New York), the English, and the\r\nFrench, all gave appellations to the tribes that dwelt within the country which\r\nis the scene of this story, and that the Indians not only gave different names\r\nto their enemies, but frequently to themselves, the cause of the confusion will\r\nbe understood.\r\n\r\nIn these pages, Lenni-Lenape, Lenope, Delawares, Wapanachki, and Mohicans, all\r\nmean the same people, or tribes of the same stock. The Mengwe, the Maquas, the\r\nMingoes, and the Iroquois, though not all strictly the same, are identified\r\nfrequently by the speakers, being politically confederated and opposed to those\r\njust named. Mingo was a term of peculiar reproach, as were Mengwe and Maqua in\r\na less degree.\r\n\r\nThe Mohicans were the possessors of the country first occupied by the Europeans\r\nin this portion of the continent. They were, consequently, the first\r\ndispossessed; and the seemingly inevitable fate of all these people, who\r\ndisappear before the advances, or it might be termed the inroads, of\r\ncivilization, as the verdure of their native forests falls before the nipping\r\nfrosts, is represented as having already befallen them. There is sufficient\r\nhistorical truth in the picture to justify the use that has been made of it.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the country which is the scene of the following tale has\r\nundergone as little change, since the historical events alluded to had place,\r\nas almost any other district of equal extent within the whole limits of the\r\nUnited States. There are fashionable and well-attended watering-places at and\r\nnear the spring where Hawkeye halted to drink, and roads traverse the forests\r\nwhere he and his friends were compelled to journey without even a path.\r\nGlen\xe2\x80\x99s has a large village; and while William Henry, and even a fortress\r\nof later date, are only to be traced as ruins, there is another village on the\r\nshores of the Horican. But, beyond this, the enterprise and energy of a people\r\nwho have done so much in other places have done little here. The whole of that\r\nwilderness, in which the latter incidents of the legend occurred, is nearly a\r\nwilderness still, though the red man has entirely deserted this part of the\r\nstate. Of all the tribes named in these pages, there exist only a few\r\nhalf-civilized beings of the Oneidas, on the reservations of their people in\r\nNew York. The rest have disappeared, either from the regions in which their\r\nfathers dwelt, or altogether from the earth.\r\n\r\nThere is one point on which we would wish to say a word before closing this\r\npreface. Hawkeye calls the Lac du Saint Sacrement, the \xe2\x80\x9cHorican.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs we believe this to be an appropriation of the name that has its origin with\r\nourselves, the time has arrived, perhaps, when the fact should be frankly\r\nadmitted. While writing this book, fully a quarter of a century since, it\r\noccurred to us that the French name of this lake was too complicated, the\r\nAmerican too commonplace, and the Indian too unpronounceable, for either to be\r\nused familiarly in a work of fiction. Looking over an ancient map, it was\r\nascertained that a tribe of Indians, called \xe2\x80\x9cLes Horicans\xe2\x80\x9d by the\r\nFrench, existed in the neighborhood of this beautiful sheet of water. As every\r\nword uttered by Natty Bumppo was not to be received as rigid truth, we took the\r\nliberty of putting the \xe2\x80\x9cHorican\xe2\x80\x9d into his mouth, as the substitute\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x9cLake George.\xe2\x80\x9d The name has appeared to find favor, and all\r\nthings considered, it may possibly be quite as well to let it stand, instead of\r\ngoing back to the House of Hanover for the appellation of our finest sheet of\r\nwater. We relieve our conscience by the confession, at all events leaving it to\r\nexercise its authority as it may see fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine ear is open, and my heart prepared:\r\nThe worst is wordly loss thou canst unfold:\xe2\x80\x94\r\nSay, is my kingdom lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Shakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of North America, that the toils\r\nand dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered before the adverse hosts\r\ncould meet. A wide and apparently an impervious boundary of forests severed the\r\npossessions of the hostile provinces of France and England. The hardy colonist,\r\nand the trained European who fought at his side, frequently expended months in\r\nstruggling against the rapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes\r\nof the mountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more\r\nmartial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the practiced\r\nnative warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty; and it would seem\r\nthat, in time, there was no recess of the woods so dark, nor any secret place\r\nso lovely, that it might claim exemption from the inroads of those who had\r\npledged their blood to satiate their vengeance, or to uphold the cold and\r\nselfish policy of the distant monarchs of Europe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate frontiers\r\ncan furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness of the savage\r\nwarfare of those periods than the country which lies between the head waters of\r\nthe Hudson and the adjacent lakes.\r\n\r\nThe facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the combatants\r\nwere too obvious to be neglected. The lengthened sheet of the Champlain\r\nstretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the borders of the\r\nneighboring province of New York, forming a natural passage across half the\r\ndistance that the French were compelled to master in order to strike their\r\nenemies. Near its southern termination, it received the contributions of\r\nanother lake, whose waters were so limpid as to have been exclusively selected\r\nby the Jesuit missionaries to perform the typical purification of baptism, and\r\nto obtain for it the title of lake \xe2\x80\x9cdu Saint Sacr\xc3\xa9ment.\xe2\x80\x9d The less\r\nzealous English thought they conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied\r\nfountains, when they bestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of\r\nthe house of Hanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its\r\nwooded scenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorican.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nAs each nation of the Indians had its language or its dialect, they usually\r\ngave different names to the same places, though nearly all of their\r\nappellations were descriptive of the object. Thus a literal translation of the\r\nname of this beautiful sheet of water, used by the tribe that dwelt on its\r\nbanks, would be \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tail of the Lake.\xe2\x80\x9d Lake George, as it is\r\nvulgarly, and now, indeed, legally, called, forms a sort of tail to Lake\r\nChamplain, when viewed on the map. Hence, the name.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9choly lake\xe2\x80\x9d extended a dozen leagues still further to the south.\r\nWith the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the\r\nwater, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the adventurer to\r\nthe banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual obstructions of the\r\nrapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the language of the country, the\r\nriver became navigable to the tide.\r\n\r\nWhile, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless\r\nenterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges of the\r\nAlleghany, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial acuteness would not\r\noverlook the natural advantages of the district we have just described. It\r\nbecame, emphatically, the bloody arena, in which most of the battles for the\r\nmastery of the colonies were contested. Forts were erected at the different\r\npoints that commanded the facilities of the route, and were taken and retaken,\r\nrazed and rebuilt, as victory alighted on the hostile banners. While the\r\nhusbandman shrank back from the dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries\r\nof the more ancient settlements, armies larger than those that had often\r\ndisposed of the scepters of the mother countries, were seen to bury themselves\r\nin these forests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands, that were\r\nhaggard with care or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were unknown\r\nto this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its shades and glens\r\nrang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes of its mountains threw\r\nback the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of many a gallant and reckless\r\nyouth, as he hurried by them, in the noontide of his spirits, to slumber in a\r\nlong night of forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nIt was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall\r\nattempt to relate occurred, during the third year of the war which England and\r\nFrance last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to\r\nretain.\r\n\r\nThe imbecility of her military leaders abroad, and the fatal want of energy in\r\nher councils at home, had lowered the character of Great Britain from the proud\r\nelevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her\r\nformer warriors and statesmen. No longer dreaded by her enemies, her servants\r\nwere fast losing the confidence of self-respect. In this mortifying abasement,\r\nthe colonists, though innocent of her imbecility, and too humble to be the\r\nagents of her blunders, were but the natural participators. They had recently\r\nseen a chosen army from that country, which, reverencing as a mother, they had\r\nblindly believed invincible\xe2\x80\x94an army led by a chief who had been selected\r\nfrom a crowd of trained warriors, for his rare military endowments,\r\ndisgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, and only saved from\r\nannihilation by the coolness and spirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame\r\nhas since diffused itself, with the steady influence of moral truth, to the\r\nuttermost confines of Christendom.[2]\r\nA wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster, and more\r\nsubstantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers.\r\nThe alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every\r\nfitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west. The\r\nterrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the\r\nnatural horrors of warfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in\r\ntheir recollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to\r\nhave drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight\r\nmurder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous\r\nactors. As the credulous and excited traveler related the hazardous chances of\r\nthe wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled with terror, and mothers cast\r\nanxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of\r\nthe largest towns. In short, the magnifying influence of fear began to set at\r\nnaught the calculations of reason, and to render those who should have\r\nremembered their manhood, the slaves of the basest passions. Even the most\r\nconfident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was\r\nbecoming doubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who\r\nthought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America\r\nsubdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their\r\nrelentless allies.\r\n\r\n [2]\r\nWashington, who, after uselessly admonishing the European general of the\r\ndanger into which he was heedlessly running, saved the remnants of the British\r\narmy, on this occasion, by his decision and courage. The reputation earned by\r\nWashington in this battle was the principal cause of his being selected to\r\ncommand the American armies at a later day. It is a circumstance worthy of\r\nobservation, that while all America rang with his well-merited reputation, his\r\nname does not occur in any European account of the battle; at least the author\r\nhas searched for it without success. In this manner does the mother country\r\nabsorb even the fame, under that system of rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort which covered the\r\nsouthern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the lakes, that\r\nMontcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous as\r\nthe leaves on the trees,\xe2\x80\x9d its truth was admitted with more of the craven\r\nreluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel, in\r\nfinding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had been brought, toward\r\nthe decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian runner, who also bore an urgent\r\nrequest from Munro, the commander of a work on the shore of the \xe2\x80\x9choly\r\nlake,\xe2\x80\x9d for a speedy and powerful reinforcement. It has already been\r\nmentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues.\r\nThe rude path, which originally formed their line of communication, had been\r\nwidened for the passage of wagons; so that the distance which had been traveled\r\nby the son of the forest in two hours, might easily be effected by a detachment\r\nof troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting of a\r\nsummer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to one of these\r\nforest-fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the other that of Fort\r\nEdward, calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family. The\r\nveteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a regiment of regulars and a\r\nfew provincials; a force really by far too small to make head against the\r\nformidable power that Montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds.\r\nAt the latter, however, lay General Webb, who commanded the armies of the king\r\nin the northern provinces, with a body of more than five thousand men. By\r\nuniting the several detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed\r\nnearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising Frenchman, who\r\nhad ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army but little superior\r\nin numbers.\r\n\r\nBut under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and men\r\nappeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists,\r\nwithin their works, than to resist the progress of their march, by emulating\r\nthe successful example of the French at Fort du Quesne, and striking a blow on\r\ntheir advance.\r\n\r\nAfter the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a rumor was\r\nspread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the margin of the\r\nHudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself, that a\r\nchosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart, with the dawn, for\r\nWilliam Henry, the post at the northern extremity of the portage. That which at\r\nfirst was only rumor, soon became certainty, as orders passed from the quarters\r\nof the commander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this\r\nservice, to prepare for their speedy departure. All doubts as to the intention\r\nof Webb now vanished, and an hour or two of hurried footsteps and anxious faces\r\nsucceeded. The novice in the military art flew from point to point, retarding\r\nhis own preparations by the excess of his violent and somewhat distempered\r\nzeal; while the more practiced veteran made his arrangements with a\r\ndeliberation that scorned every appearance of haste; though his sober\r\nlineaments and anxious eye sufficiently betrayed that he had no very strong\r\nprofessional relish for the, as yet, untried and dreaded warfare of the\r\nwilderness. At length the sun set in a flood of glory, behind the distant\r\nwestern hills, and as darkness drew its veil around the secluded spot the\r\nsounds of preparation diminished; the last light finally disappeared from the\r\nlog cabin of some officer; the trees cast their deeper shadows over the mounds\r\nand the rippling stream, and a silence soon pervaded the camp, as deep as that\r\nwhich reigned in the vast forest by which it was environed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the orders of the preceding night, the heavy sleep of the army was\r\nbroken by the rolling of the warning drums, whose rattling echoes were heard\r\nissuing, on the damp morning air, out of every vista of the woods, just as day\r\nbegan to draw the shaggy outlines of some tall pines of the vicinity, on the\r\nopening brightness of a soft and cloudless eastern sky. In an instant the whole\r\ncamp was in motion; the meanest soldier arousing from his lair to witness the\r\ndeparture of his comrades, and to share in the excitement and incidents of the\r\nhour. The simple array of the chosen band was soon completed. While the regular\r\nand trained hirelings of the king marched with haughtiness to the right of the\r\nline, the less pretending colonists took their humbler position on its left,\r\nwith a docility that long practice had rendered easy. The scouts departed;\r\nstrong guards preceded and followed the lumbering vehicles that bore the\r\nbaggage; and before the gray light of the morning was mellowed by the rays of\r\nthe sun, the main body of the combatants wheeled into column, and left the\r\nencampment with a show of high military bearing, that served to drown the\r\nslumbering apprehensions of many a novice, who was now about to make his first\r\nessay in arms. While in view of their admiring comrades, the same proud front\r\nand ordered array was observed, until the notes of their fifes growing fainter\r\nin distance, the forest at length appeared to swallow up the living mass which\r\nhad slowly entered its bosom.\r\n\r\nThe deepest sounds of the retiring and invisible column had ceased to be borne\r\non the breeze to the listeners, and the latest straggler had already\r\ndisappeared in pursuit; but there still remained the signs of another\r\ndeparture, before a log cabin of unusual size and accommodations, in front of\r\nwhich those sentinels paced their rounds, who were known to guard the person of\r\nthe English general. At this spot were gathered some half dozen horses,\r\ncaparisoned in a manner which showed that two, at least, were destined to bear\r\nthe persons of females, of a rank that it was not usual to meet so far in the\r\nwilds of the country. A third wore trappings and arms of an officer of the\r\nstaff; while the rest, from the plainness of the housings, and the traveling\r\nmails with which they were encumbered, were evidently fitted for the reception\r\nof as many menials, who were, seemingly, already waiting the pleasure of those\r\nthey served. At a respectful distance from this unusual show, were gathered\r\ndivers groups of curious idlers; some admiring the blood and bone of the\r\nhigh-mettled military charger, and others gazing at the preparations, with the\r\ndull wonder of vulgar curiosity. There was one man, however, who, by his\r\ncountenance and actions, formed a marked exception to those who composed the\r\nlatter class of spectators, being neither idle, nor seemingly very ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe person of this individual was to the last degree ungainly, without being in\r\nany particular manner deformed. He had all the bones and joints of other men,\r\nwithout any of their proportions. Erect, his stature surpassed that of his\r\nfellows; though seated, he appeared reduced within the ordinary limits of the\r\nrace. The same contrariety in his members seemed to exist throughout the whole\r\nman. His head was large; his shoulders narrow; his arms long and dangling;\r\nwhile his hands were small, if not delicate. His legs and thighs were thin,\r\nnearly to emaciation, but of extraordinary length; and his knees would have\r\nbeen considered tremendous, had they not been outdone by the broader\r\nfoundations on which this false superstructure of blended human orders was so\r\nprofanely reared. The ill-assorted and injudicious attire of the individual\r\nonly served to render his awkwardness more conspicuous. A sky-blue coat, with\r\nshort and broad skirts and low cape, exposed a long, thin neck, and longer and\r\nthinner legs, to the worst animadversions of the evil-disposed. His nether\r\ngarment was a yellow nankeen, closely fitted to the shape, and tied at his\r\nbunches of knees by large knots of white ribbon, a good deal sullied by use.\r\nClouded cotton stockings, and shoes, on one of the latter of which was a plated\r\nspur, completed the costume of the lower extremity of this figure, no curve or\r\nangle of which was concealed, but, on the other hand, studiously exhibited,\r\nthrough the vanity or simplicity of its owner.\r\n\r\nFrom beneath the flap of an enormous pocket of a soiled vest of embossed silk,\r\nheavily ornamented with tarnished silver lace, projected an instrument, which,\r\nfrom being seen in such martial company, might have been easily mistaken for\r\nsome mischievous and unknown implement of war. Small as it was, this uncommon\r\nengine had excited the curiosity of most of the Europeans in the camp, though\r\nseveral of the provincials were seen to handle it, not only without fear, but\r\nwith the utmost familiarity. A large, civil cocked hat, like those worn by\r\nclergymen within the last thirty years, surmounted the whole, furnishing\r\ndignity to a good-natured and somewhat vacant countenance, that apparently\r\nneeded such artificial aid, to support the gravity of some high and\r\nextraordinary trust.\r\n\r\nWhile the common herd stood aloof, in deference to the quarters of Webb, the\r\nfigure we have described stalked into the center of the domestics, freely\r\nexpressing his censures or commendations on the merits of the horses, as by\r\nchance they displeased or satisfied his judgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is\r\nfrom foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the blue\r\nwater?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a voice as remarkable for the softness and sweetness\r\nof its tones, as was his person for its rare proportions; \xe2\x80\x9cI may speak of\r\nthese things, and be no braggart; for I have been down at both havens; that\r\nwhich is situate at the mouth of Thames, and is named after the capital of Old\r\nEngland, and that which is called \xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99, with the addition of the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x98New\xe2\x80\x99; and have seen the scows and brigantines collecting\r\ntheir droves, like the gathering to the ark, being outward bound to the Island\r\nof Jamaica, for the purpose of barter and traffic in four-footed animals; but\r\nnever before have I beheld a beast which verified the true scripture war-horse\r\nlike this: \xe2\x80\x98He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength; he\r\ngoeth on to meet the armed men. He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he\r\nsmelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the\r\nshouting.\xe2\x80\x99 It would seem that the stock of the horse of Israel had\r\ndescended to our own time; would it not, friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReceiving no reply to this extraordinary appeal, which in truth, as it was\r\ndelivered with the vigor of full and sonorous tones, merited some sort of\r\nnotice, he who had thus sung forth the language of the holy book turned to the\r\nsilent figure to whom he had unwittingly addressed himself, and found a new and\r\nmore powerful subject of admiration in the object that encountered his gaze.\r\nHis eyes fell on the still, upright, and rigid form of the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian\r\nrunner,\xe2\x80\x9d who had borne to the camp the unwelcome tidings of the preceding\r\nevening. Although in a state of perfect repose, and apparently disregarding,\r\nwith characteristic stoicism, the excitement and bustle around him, there was a\r\nsullen fierceness mingled with the quiet of the savage, that was likely to\r\narrest the attention of much more experienced eyes than those which now scanned\r\nhim, in unconcealed amazement. The native bore both the tomahawk and knife of\r\nhis tribe; and yet his appearance was not altogether that of a warrior. On the\r\ncontrary, there was an air of neglect about his person, like that which might\r\nhave proceeded from great and recent exertion, which he had not yet found\r\nleisure to repair. The colors of the war-paint had blended in dark confusion\r\nabout his fierce countenance, and rendered his swarthy lineaments still more\r\nsavage and repulsive than if art had attempted an effect which had been thus\r\nproduced by chance. His eye, alone, which glistened like a fiery star amid\r\nlowering clouds, was to be seen in its state of native wildness. For a single\r\ninstant his searching and yet wary glance met the wondering look of the other,\r\nand then changing its direction, partly in cunning, and partly in disdain, it\r\nremained fixed, as if penetrating the distant air.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say what unlooked-for remark this short and silent\r\ncommunication, between two such singular men, might have elicited from the\r\nwhite man, had not his active curiosity been again drawn to other objects. A\r\ngeneral movement among the domestics, and a low sound of gentle voices,\r\nannounced the approach of those whose presence alone was wanted to enable the\r\ncavalcade to move. The simple admirer of the war-horse instantly fell back to a\r\nlow, gaunt, switch-tailed mare, that was unconsciously gleaning the faded\r\nherbage of the camp nigh by; where, leaning with one elbow on the blanket that\r\nconcealed an apology for a saddle, he became a spectator of the departure,\r\nwhile a foal was quietly making its morning repast, on the opposite side of the\r\nsame animal.\r\n\r\nA young man, in the dress of an officer, conducted to their steeds two females,\r\nwho, as it was apparent by their dresses, were prepared to encounter the\r\nfatigues of a journey in the woods. One, and she was the more juvenile in her\r\nappearance, though both were young, permitted glimpses of her dazzling\r\ncomplexion, fair golden hair, and bright blue eyes, to be caught, as she\r\nartlessly suffered the morning air to blow aside the green veil which descended\r\nlow from her beaver.\r\n\r\nThe flush which still lingered above the pines in the western sky was not more\r\nbright nor delicate than the bloom on her cheek; nor was the opening day more\r\ncheering than the animated smile which she bestowed on the youth, as he\r\nassisted her into the saddle. The other, who appeared to share equally in the\r\nattention of the young officer, concealed her charms from the gaze of the\r\nsoldiery with a care that seemed better fitted to the experience of four or\r\nfive additional years. It could be seen, however, that her person, though\r\nmolded with the same exquisite proportions, of which none of the graces were\r\nlost by the traveling dress she wore, was rather fuller and more mature than\r\nthat of her companion.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were these females seated, than their attendant sprang lightly into\r\nthe saddle of the war-horse, when the whole three bowed to Webb, who in\r\ncourtesy, awaited their parting on the threshold of his cabin and turning their\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 heads, they proceeded at a slow amble, followed by their train,\r\ntoward the northern entrance of the encampment. As they traversed that short\r\ndistance, not a voice was heard among them; but a slight exclamation proceeded\r\nfrom the younger of the females, as the Indian runner glided by her,\r\nunexpectedly, and led the way along the military road in her front. Though this\r\nsudden and startling movement of the Indian produced no sound from the other,\r\nin the surprise her veil also was allowed to open its folds, and betrayed an\r\nindescribable look of pity, admiration, and horror, as her dark eye followed\r\nthe easy motions of the savage. The tresses of this lady were shining and\r\nblack, like the plumage of the raven. Her complexion was not brown, but it\r\nrather appeared charged with the color of the rich blood, that seemed ready to\r\nburst its bounds. And yet there was neither coarseness nor want of shadowing in\r\na countenance that was exquisitely regular, and dignified and surpassingly\r\nbeautiful. She smiled, as if in pity at her own momentary forgetfulness,\r\ndiscovering by the act a row of teeth that would have shamed the purest ivory;\r\nwhen, replacing the veil, she bowed her face, and rode in silence, like one\r\nwhose thoughts were abstracted from the scene around her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSola, sola, wo ha, ho, sola!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile one of the lovely beings we have so cursorily presented to the reader was\r\nthus lost in thought, the other quickly recovered from the alarm which induced\r\nthe exclamation, and, laughing at her own weakness, she inquired of the youth\r\nwho rode by her side:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre such specters frequent in the woods, Heyward, or is this sight an\r\nespecial entertainment ordered on our behalf? If the latter, gratitude must\r\nclose our mouths; but if the former, both Cora and I shall have need to draw\r\nlargely on that stock of hereditary courage which we boast, even before we are\r\nmade to encounter the redoubtable Montcalm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYon Indian is a \xe2\x80\x98runner\xe2\x80\x99 of the army; and, after the fashion\r\nof his people, he may be accounted a hero,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the officer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has volunteered to guide us to the lake, by a path but little known,\r\nsooner than if we followed the tardy movements of the column; and, by\r\nconsequence, more agreeably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like him not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, shuddering, partly in assumed, yet\r\nmore in real terror. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know him, Duncan, or you would not trust\r\nyourself so freely to his keeping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, rather, Alice, that I would not trust you. I do know him, or he\r\nwould not have my confidence, and least of all at this moment. He is said to be\r\na Canadian too; and yet he served with our friends the Mohawks, who, as you\r\nknow, are one of the six allied nations. He was brought among us, as I have\r\nheard, by some strange accident in which your father was interested, and in\r\nwhich the savage was rigidly dealt by; but I forget the idle tale, it is\r\nenough, that he is now our friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he has been my father\xe2\x80\x99s enemy, I like him still less!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed the now really anxious girl. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you not speak to him, Major\r\nHeyward, that I may hear his tones? Foolish though it may be, you have often\r\nheard me avow my faith in the tones of the human voice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be in vain; and answered, most probably, by an ejaculation.\r\nThough he may understand it, he affects, like most of his people, to be\r\nignorant of the English; and least of all will he condescend to speak it, now\r\nthat the war demands the utmost exercise of his dignity. But he stops; the\r\nprivate path by which we are to journey is, doubtless, at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conjecture of Major Heyward was true. When they reached the spot where the\r\nIndian stood, pointing into the thicket that fringed the military road; a\r\nnarrow and blind path, which might, with some little inconvenience, receive one\r\nperson at a time, became visible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, then, lies our way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, in a low voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManifest no distrust, or you may invite the danger you appear to\r\napprehend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCora, what think you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reluctant fair one. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\r\njourney with the troops, though we may find their presence irksome, shall we\r\nnot feel better assurance of our safety?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing little accustomed to the practices of the savages, Alice, you\r\nmistake the place of real danger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward. \xe2\x80\x9cIf enemies have\r\nreached the portage at all, a thing by no means probable, as our scouts are\r\nabroad, they will surely be found skirting the column, where scalps abound the\r\nmost. The route of the detachment is known, while ours, having been determined\r\nwithin the hour, must still be secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould we distrust the man because his manners are not our manners, and\r\nthat his skin is dark?\xe2\x80\x9d coldly asked Cora.\r\n\r\nAlice hesitated no longer; but giving her Narrangansett[1]\r\na smart cut of the whip, she was the first to dash aside the slight branches of\r\nthe bushes, and to follow the runner along the dark and tangled pathway. The\r\nyoung man regarded the last speaker in open admiration, and even permitted her\r\nfairer, though certainly not more beautiful companion, to proceed unattended,\r\nwhile he sedulously opened the way himself for the passage of her who has been\r\ncalled Cora. It would seem that the domestics had been previously instructed;\r\nfor, instead of penetrating the thicket, they followed the route of the column;\r\na measure which Heyward stated had been dictated by the sagacity of their\r\nguide, in order to diminish the marks of their trail, if, haply, the Canadian\r\nsavages should be lurking so far in advance of their army. For many minutes the\r\nintricacy of the route admitted of no further dialogue; after which they\r\nemerged from the broad border of underbrush which grew along the line of the\r\nhighway, and entered under the high but dark arches of the forest. Here their\r\nprogress was less interrupted; and the instant the guide perceived that the\r\nfemales could command their steeds, he moved on, at a pace between a trot and a\r\nwalk, and at a rate which kept the sure-footed and peculiar animals they rode\r\nat a fast yet easy amble. The youth had turned to speak to the dark-eyed Cora,\r\nwhen the distant sound of horses hoofs, clattering over the roots of the broken\r\nway in his rear, caused him to check his charger; and, as his companions drew\r\ntheir reins at the same instant, the whole party came to a halt, in order to\r\nobtain an explanation of the unlooked-for interruption.\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nIn the state of Rhode Island there is a bay called Narragansett, so named\r\nafter a powerful tribe of Indians, which formerly dwelt on its banks. Accident,\r\nor one of those unaccountable freaks which nature sometimes plays in the animal\r\nworld, gave rise to a breed of horses which were once well known in America,\r\nand distinguished by their habit of pacing. Horses of this race were, and are\r\nstill, in much request as saddle horses, on account of their hardiness and the\r\nease of their movements. As they were also sure of foot, the Narragansetts were\r\ngreatly sought for by females who were obliged to travel over the roots and\r\nholes in the \xe2\x80\x9cnew countries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a colt was seen gliding, like a fallow deer, among the\r\nstraight trunks of the pines; and, in another instant, the person of the\r\nungainly man, described in the preceding chapter, came into view, with as much\r\nrapidity as he could excite his meager beast to endure without coming to an\r\nopen rupture. Until now this personage had escaped the observation of the\r\ntravelers. If he possessed the power to arrest any wandering eye when\r\nexhibiting the glories of his altitude on foot, his equestrian graces were\r\nstill more likely to attract attention.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a constant application of his one armed heel to the flanks of\r\nthe mare, the most confirmed gait that he could establish was a Canterbury\r\ngallop with the hind legs, in which those more forward assisted for doubtful\r\nmoments, though generally content to maintain a loping trot. Perhaps the\r\nrapidity of the changes from one of these paces to the other created an optical\r\nillusion, which might thus magnify the powers of the beast; for it is certain\r\nthat Heyward, who possessed a true eye for the merits of a horse, was unable,\r\nwith his utmost ingenuity, to decide by what sort of movement his pursuer\r\nworked his sinuous way on his footsteps with such persevering hardihood.\r\n\r\nThe industry and movements of the rider were not less remarkable than those of\r\nthe ridden. At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the former raised\r\nhis tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this manner, by the undue\r\nelongation of his legs, such sudden growths and diminishings of the stature, as\r\nbaffled every conjecture that might be made as to his dimensions. If to this be\r\nadded the fact that, in consequence of the ex parte application of the spur,\r\none side of the mare appeared to journey faster than the other; and that the\r\naggrieved flank was resolutely indicated by unremitted flourishes of a bushy\r\ntail, we finish the picture of both horse and man.\r\n\r\nThe frown which had gathered around the handsome, open, and manly brow of\r\nHeyward, gradually relaxed, and his lips curled into a slight smile, as he\r\nregarded the stranger. Alice made no very powerful effort to control her\r\nmerriment; and even the dark, thoughtful eye of Cora lighted with a humor that\r\nit would seem, the habit, rather than the nature, of its mistress repressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeek you any here?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward, when the other had arrived\r\nsufficiently nigh to abate his speed; \xe2\x80\x9cI trust you are no messenger of\r\nevil tidings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger, making diligent use of his\r\ntriangular castor, to produce a circulation in the close air of the woods, and\r\nleaving his hearers in doubt to which of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s questions he\r\nresponded; when, however, he had cooled his face, and recovered his breath, he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cI hear you are riding to William Henry; as I am journeying\r\nthitherward myself, I concluded good company would seem consistent to the\r\nwishes of both parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appear to possess the privilege of a casting vote,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nHeyward; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are three, while you have consulted no one but\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so. The first point to be obtained is to know one\xe2\x80\x99s own mind.\r\nOnce sure of that, and where women are concerned it is not easy, the next is,\r\nto act up to the decision. I have endeavored to do both, and here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you journey to the lake, you have mistaken your route,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHeyward, haughtily; \xe2\x80\x9cthe highway thither is at least half a mile behind\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the stranger, nothing daunted by this cold\r\nreception; \xe2\x80\x9cI have tarried at \xe2\x80\x98Edward\xe2\x80\x99 a week, and I should\r\nbe dumb not to have inquired the road I was to journey; and if dumb there would\r\nbe an end to my calling.\xe2\x80\x9d After simpering in a small way, like one whose\r\nmodesty prohibited a more open expression of his admiration of a witticism that\r\nwas perfectly unintelligible to his hearers, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not\r\nprudent for any one of my profession to be too familiar with those he has to\r\ninstruct; for which reason I follow not the line of the army; besides which, I\r\nconclude that a gentleman of your character has the best judgment in matters of\r\nwayfaring; I have, therefore, decided to join company, in order that the ride\r\nmay be made agreeable, and partake of social communion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most arbitrary, if not a hasty decision!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Heyward,\r\nundecided whether to give vent to his growing anger, or to laugh in the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you speak of instruction, and of a profession;\r\nare you an adjunct to the provincial corps, as a master of the noble science of\r\ndefense and offense; or, perhaps, you are one who draws lines and angles, under\r\nthe pretense of expounding the mathematics?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger regarded his interrogator a moment in wonder; and then, losing\r\nevery mark of self-satisfaction in an expression of solemn humility, he\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf offense, I hope there is none, to either party: of defense, I make\r\nnone\xe2\x80\x94by God\xe2\x80\x99s good mercy, having committed no palpable sin since\r\nlast entreating his pardoning grace. I understand not your allusions about\r\nlines and angles; and I leave expounding to those who have been called and set\r\napart for that holy office. I lay claim to no higher gift than a small insight\r\ninto the glorious art of petitioning and thanksgiving, as practiced in\r\npsalmody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man is, most manifestly, a disciple of Apollo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\namused Alice, \xe2\x80\x9cand I take him under my own especial protection. Nay,\r\nthrow aside that frown, Heyward, and in pity to my longing ears, suffer him to\r\njourney in our train. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in a low and hurried voice,\r\ncasting a glance at the distant Cora, who slowly followed the footsteps of\r\ntheir silent, but sullen guide, \xe2\x80\x9cit may be a friend added to our\r\nstrength, in time of need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink you, Alice, that I would trust those I love by this secret path,\r\ndid I imagine such need could happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, I think not of it now; but this strange man amuses me; and if\r\nhe \xe2\x80\x98hath music in his soul\xe2\x80\x99, let us not churlishly reject his\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed persuasively along the path with her riding whip,\r\nwhile their eyes met in a look which the young man lingered a moment to\r\nprolong; then, yielding to her gentle influence, he clapped his spurs into his\r\ncharger, and in a few bounds was again at the side of Cora.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to encounter thee, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the maiden, waving\r\nher hand to the stranger to proceed, as she urged her Narragansett to renew its\r\namble. \xe2\x80\x9cPartial relatives have almost persuaded me that I am not entirely\r\nworthless in a duet myself; and we may enliven our wayfaring by indulging in\r\nour favorite pursuit. It might be of signal advantage to one, ignorant as I, to\r\nhear the opinions and experience of a master in the art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is refreshing both to the spirits and to the body to indulge in\r\npsalmody, in befitting seasons,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the master of song,\r\nunhesitatingly complying with her intimation to follow; \xe2\x80\x9cand nothing\r\nwould relieve the mind more than such a consoling communion. But four parts are\r\naltogether necessary to the perfection of melody. You have all the\r\nmanifestations of a soft and rich treble; I can, by especial aid, carry a full\r\ntenor to the highest letter; but we lack counter and bass! Yon officer of the\r\nking, who hesitated to admit me to his company, might fill the latter, if one\r\nmay judge from the intonations of his voice in common dialogue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudge not too rashly from hasty and deceptive appearances,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe lady, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cthough Major Heyward can assume such deep notes on\r\noccasion, believe me, his natural tones are better fitted for a mellow tenor\r\nthan the bass you heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he, then, much practiced in the art of psalmody?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded her\r\nsimple companion.\r\n\r\nAlice felt disposed to laugh, though she succeeded in suppressing her\r\nmerriment, ere she answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI apprehend that he is rather addicted to profane song. The chances of a\r\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s life are but little fitted for the encouragement of more sober\r\ninclinations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan\xe2\x80\x99s voice is given to him, like his other talents, to be used,\r\nand not to be abused. None can say they have ever known me to neglect my gifts!\r\nI am thankful that, though my boyhood may be said to have been set apart, like\r\nthe youth of the royal David, for the purposes of music, no syllable of rude\r\nverse has ever profaned my lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, then, limited your efforts to sacred song?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so. As the psalms of David exceed all other language, so does the\r\npsalmody that has been fitted to them by the divines and sages of the land,\r\nsurpass all vain poetry. Happily, I may say that I utter nothing but the\r\nthoughts and the wishes of the King of Israel himself; for though the times may\r\ncall for some slight changes, yet does this version which we use in the\r\ncolonies of New England so much exceed all other versions, that, by its\r\nrichness, its exactness, and its spiritual simplicity, it approacheth, as near\r\nas may be, to the great work of the inspired writer. I never abide in any\r\nplace, sleeping or waking, without an example of this gifted work. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nthe six-and-twentieth edition, promulgated at Boston, Anno Domini 1744; and is\r\nentitled, \xe2\x80\x98The Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs of the Old and New\r\nTestaments; faithfully translated into English Metre, for the Use, Edification,\r\nand Comfort of the Saints, in Public and Private, especially in New\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this eulogium on the rare production of his native poets, the stranger\r\nhad drawn the book from his pocket, and fitting a pair of iron-rimmed\r\nspectacles to his nose, opened the volume with a care and veneration suited to\r\nits sacred purposes. Then, without circumlocution or apology, first pronounced\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9cStandish,\xe2\x80\x9d and placing the unknown engine, already\r\ndescribed, to his mouth, from which he drew a high, shrill sound, that was\r\nfollowed by an octave below, from his own voice, he commenced singing the\r\nfollowing words, in full, sweet, and melodious tones, that set the music, the\r\npoetry, and even the uneasy motion of his ill-trained beast at defiance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow good it is, O see,\r\n    And how it pleaseth well,\r\nTogether e\xe2\x80\x99en in unity,\r\n    For brethren so to dwell.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like the choice ointment,\r\n    From the head to the beard did go;\r\nDown Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s head, that downward went\r\n    His garment\xe2\x80\x99s skirts unto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe delivery of these skillful rhymes was accompanied, on the part of the\r\nstranger, by a regular rise and fall of his right hand, which terminated at the\r\ndescent, by suffering the fingers to dwell a moment on the leaves of the little\r\nvolume; and on the ascent, by such a flourish of the member as none but the\r\ninitiated may ever hope to imitate. It would seem long practice had rendered\r\nthis manual accompaniment necessary; for it did not cease until the preposition\r\nwhich the poet had selected for the close of his verse had been duly delivered\r\nlike a word of two syllables.\r\n\r\nSuch an innovation on the silence and retirement of the forest could not fail\r\nto enlist the ears of those who journeyed at so short a distance in advance.\r\nThe Indian muttered a few words in broken English to Heyward, who, in his turn,\r\nspoke to the stranger; at once interrupting, and, for the time, closing his\r\nmusical efforts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough we are not in danger, common prudence would teach us to journey\r\nthrough this wilderness in as quiet a manner as possible. You will then, pardon\r\nme, Alice, should I diminish your enjoyments, by requesting this gentleman to\r\npostpone his chant until a safer opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will diminish them, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the arch girl;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor never did I hear a more unworthy conjunction of execution and\r\nlanguage than that to which I have been listening; and I was far gone in a\r\nlearned inquiry into the causes of such an unfitness between sound and sense,\r\nwhen you broke the charm of my musings by that bass of yours, Duncan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not what you call my bass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, piqued at her\r\nremark, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know that your safety, and that of Cora, is far dearer to\r\nme than could be any orchestra of Handel\xe2\x80\x99s music.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused and\r\nturned his head quickly toward a thicket, and then bent his eyes suspiciously\r\non their guide, who continued his steady pace, in undisturbed gravity. The\r\nyoung man smiled to himself, for he believed he had mistaken some shining berry\r\nof the woods for the glistening eyeballs of a prowling savage, and he rode\r\nforward, continuing the conversation which had been interrupted by the passing\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nMajor Heyward was mistaken only in suffering his youthful and generous pride to\r\nsuppress his active watchfulness. The cavalcade had not long passed, before the\r\nbranches of the bushes that formed the thicket were cautiously moved asunder,\r\nand a human visage, as fiercely wild as savage art and unbridled passions could\r\nmake it, peered out on the retiring footsteps of the travelers. A gleam of\r\nexultation shot across the darkly-painted lineaments of the inhabitant of the\r\nforest, as he traced the route of his intended victims, who rode unconsciously\r\nonward, the light and graceful forms of the females waving among the trees, in\r\nthe curvatures of their path, followed at each bend by the manly figure of\r\nHeyward, until, finally, the shapeless person of the singing master was\r\nconcealed behind the numberless trunks of trees, that rose, in dark lines, in\r\nthe intermediate space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore these fields were shorn and till\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nFull to the brim our rivers flow\xe2\x80\x99d;\r\nThe melody of waters fill\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe fresh and boundless wood;\r\nAnd torrents dash\xe2\x80\x99d, and rivulets play\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAnd fountains spouted in the shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Bryant\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the unsuspecting Heyward and his confiding companions to penetrate\r\nstill deeper into a forest that contained such treacherous inmates, we must use\r\nan author\xe2\x80\x99s privilege, and shift the scene a few miles to the westward of\r\nthe place where we have last seen them.\r\n\r\nOn that day, two men were lingering on the banks of a small but rapid stream,\r\nwithin an hour\xe2\x80\x99s journey of the encampment of Webb, like those who\r\nawaited the appearance of an absent person, or the approach of some expected\r\nevent. The vast canopy of woods spread itself to the margin of the river,\r\noverhanging the water, and shadowing its dark current with a deeper hue. The\r\nrays of the sun were beginning to grow less fierce, and the intense heat of the\r\nday was lessened, as the cooler vapors of the springs and fountains rose above\r\ntheir leafy beds, and rested in the atmosphere. Still that breathing silence,\r\nwhich marks the drowsy sultriness of an American landscape in July, pervaded\r\nthe secluded spot, interrupted only by the low voices of the men, the\r\noccasional and lazy tap of a woodpecker, the discordant cry of some gaudy jay,\r\nor a swelling on the ear, from the dull roar of a distant waterfall. These\r\nfeeble and broken sounds were, however, too familiar to the foresters to draw\r\ntheir attention from the more interesting matter of their dialogue. While one\r\nof these loiterers showed the red skin and wild accouterments of a native of\r\nthe woods, the other exhibited, through the mask of his rude and nearly savage\r\nequipments, the brighter, though sun-burned and long-faced complexion of one\r\nwho might claim descent from a European parentage. The former was seated on the\r\nend of a mossy log, in a posture that permitted him to heighten the effect of\r\nhis earnest language, by the calm but expressive gestures of an Indian engaged\r\nin debate. His body, which was nearly naked, presented a terrific emblem of\r\ndeath, drawn in intermingled colors of white and black. His closely-shaved\r\nhead, on which no other hair than the well-known and chivalrous scalping\r\ntuft[1]\r\nwas preserved, was without ornament of any kind, with the exception of a\r\nsolitary eagle\xe2\x80\x99s plume, that crossed his crown, and depended over the\r\nleft shoulder. A tomahawk and scalping knife, of English manufacture, were in\r\nhis girdle; while a short military rifle, of that sort with which the policy of\r\nthe whites armed their savage allies, lay carelessly across his bare and sinewy\r\nknee. The expanded chest, full formed limbs, and grave countenance of this\r\nwarrior, would denote that he had reached the vigor of his days, though no\r\nsymptoms of decay appeared to have yet weakened his manhood.\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nThe North American warrior caused the hair to be plucked from his whole body;\r\na small tuft was left on the crown of his head, in order that his enemy might\r\navail himself of it, in wrenching off the scalp in the event of his fall. The\r\nscalp was the only admissible trophy of victory. Thus, it was deemed more\r\nimportant to obtain the scalp than to kill the man. Some tribes lay great\r\nstress on the honor of striking a dead body. These practices have nearly\r\ndisappeared among the Indians of the Atlantic states.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frame of the white man, judging by such parts as were not concealed by his\r\nclothes, was like that of one who had known hardships and exertion from his\r\nearliest youth. His person, though muscular, was rather attenuated than full;\r\nbut every nerve and muscle appeared strung and indurated by unremitted exposure\r\nand toil. He wore a hunting shirt of forest-green, fringed with faded\r\nyellow[2],\r\nand a summer cap of skins which had been shorn of their fur. He also bore a\r\nknife in a girdle of wampum, like that which confined the scanty garments of\r\nthe Indian, but no tomahawk. His moccasins were ornamented after the gay\r\nfashion of the natives, while the only part of his under dress which appeared\r\nbelow the hunting-frock was a pair of buckskin leggings, that laced at the\r\nsides, and which were gartered above the knees, with the sinews of a deer. A\r\npouch and horn completed his personal accouterments, though a rifle of great\r\nlength[3], which\r\nthe theory of the more ingenious whites had taught them was the most dangerous\r\nof all firearms, leaned against a neighboring sapling. The eye of the hunter,\r\nor scout, whichever he might be, was small, quick, keen, and restless, roving\r\nwhile he spoke, on every side of him, as if in quest of game, or distrusting\r\nthe sudden approach of some lurking enemy. Notwithstanding the symptoms of\r\nhabitual suspicion, his countenance was not only without guile, but at the\r\nmoment at which he is introduced, it was charged with an expression of sturdy\r\nhonesty.\r\n\r\n [2]\r\nThe hunting-shirt is a picturesque smock-frock, being shorter, and ornamented\r\nwith fringes and tassels. The colors are intended to imitate the hues of the\r\nwood, with a view to concealment. Many corps of American riflemen have been\r\nthus attired, and the dress is one of the most striking of modern times. The\r\nhunting-shirt is frequently white.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3]\r\nThe rifle of the army is short; that of the hunter is always long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven your traditions make the case in my favor, Chingachgook,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, speaking in the tongue which was known to all the natives who formerly\r\ninhabited the country between the Hudson and the Potomac, and of which we shall\r\ngive a free translation for the benefit of the reader; endeavoring, at the same\r\ntime, to preserve some of the peculiarities, both of the individual and of the\r\nlanguage. \xe2\x80\x9cYour fathers came from the setting sun, crossed the big\r\nriver[4], fought\r\nthe people of the country, and took the land; and mine came from the red sky of\r\nthe morning, over the salt lake, and did their work much after the fashion that\r\nhad been set them by yours; then let God judge the matter between us, and\r\nfriends spare their words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [4]\r\nThe Mississippi. The scout alludes to a tradition which is very popular among\r\nthe tribes of the Atlantic states. Evidence of their Asiatic origin is deduced\r\nfrom the circumstances, though great uncertainty hangs over the whole history\r\nof the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy fathers fought with the naked red man!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Indian,\r\nsternly, in the same language. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there no difference, Hawkeye, between\r\nthe stone-headed arrow of the warrior, and the leaden bullet with which you\r\nkill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is reason in an Indian, though nature has made him with a red\r\nskin!\xe2\x80\x9d said the white man, shaking his head like one on whom such an\r\nappeal to his justice was not thrown away. For a moment he appeared to be\r\nconscious of having the worst of the argument, then, rallying again, he\r\nanswered the objection of his antagonist in the best manner his limited\r\ninformation would allow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no scholar, and I care not who knows it; but, judging from what I\r\nhave seen, at deer chases and squirrel hunts, of the sparks below, I should\r\nthink a rifle in the hands of their grandfathers was not so dangerous as a\r\nhickory bow and a good flint-head might be, if drawn with Indian judgment, and\r\nsent by an Indian eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the story told by your fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other,\r\ncoldly waving his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat say your old men? Do they tell the young\r\nwarriors that the pale faces met the red men, painted for war and armed with\r\nthe stone hatchet and wooden gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a prejudiced man, nor one who vaunts himself on his natural\r\nprivileges, though the worst enemy I have on earth, and he is an Iroquois,\r\ndaren\xe2\x80\x99t deny that I am genuine white,\xe2\x80\x9d the scout replied,\r\nsurveying, with secret satisfaction, the faded color of his bony and sinewy\r\nhand, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am willing to own that my people have many ways, of which,\r\nas an honest man, I can\xe2\x80\x99t approve. It is one of their customs to write in\r\nbooks what they have done and seen, instead of telling them in their villages,\r\nwhere the lie can be given to the face of a cowardly boaster, and the brave\r\nsoldier can call on his comrades to witness for the truth of his words. In\r\nconsequence of this bad fashion, a man, who is too conscientious to misspend\r\nhis days among the women, in learning the names of black marks, may never hear\r\nof the deeds of his fathers, nor feel a pride in striving to outdo them. For\r\nmyself, I conclude the Bumppos could shoot, for I have a natural turn with a\r\nrifle, which must have been handed down from generation to generation, as, our\r\nholy commandments tell us, all good and evil gifts are bestowed; though I\r\nshould be loath to answer for other people in such a matter. But every story\r\nhas its two sides; so I ask you, Chingachgook, what passed, according to the\r\ntraditions of the red men, when our fathers first met?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silence of a minute succeeded, during which the Indian sat mute; then, full\r\nof the dignity of his office, he commenced his brief tale, with a solemnity\r\nthat served to heighten its appearance of truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Hawkeye, and your ear shall drink no lie. \xe2\x80\x99Tis what my\r\nfathers have said, and what the Mohicans have done.\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated a\r\nsingle instant, and bending a cautious glance toward his companion, he\r\ncontinued, in a manner that was divided between interrogation and assertion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes not this stream at our feet run toward the summer, until its waters\r\ngrow salt, and the current flows upward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be denied that your traditions tell you true in both\r\nthese matters,\xe2\x80\x9d said the white man; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have been there, and\r\nhave seen them, though why water, which is so sweet in the shade, should become\r\nbitter in the sun, is an alteration for which I have never been able to\r\naccount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the current!\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the Indian, who expected his reply with\r\nthat sort of interest that a man feels in the confirmation of testimony, at\r\nwhich he marvels even while he respects it; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fathers of Chingachgook\r\nhave not lied!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe holy Bible is not more true, and that is the truest thing in nature.\r\nThey call this up-stream current the tide, which is a thing soon explained, and\r\nclear enough. Six hours the waters run in, and six hours they run out, and the\r\nreason is this: when there is higher water in the sea than in the river, they\r\nrun in until the river gets to be highest, and then it runs out again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe waters in the woods, and on the great lakes, run downward until they\r\nlie like my hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Indian, stretching the limb horizontally\r\nbefore him, \xe2\x80\x9cand then they run no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo honest man will deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, a little nettled at\r\nthe implied distrust of his explanation of the mystery of the tides; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI grant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level. But\r\neverything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the small scale,\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x99arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In this manner,\r\npools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lakes, may be stagnant, as you\r\nand I both know they are, having seen them; but when you come to spread water\r\nover a great tract, like the sea, where the earth is round, how in reason can\r\nthe water be quiet? You might as well expect the river to lie still on the\r\nbrink of those black rocks a mile above us, though your own ears tell you that\r\nit is tumbling over them at this very moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf unsatisfied by the philosophy of his companion, the Indian was far too\r\ndignified to betray his unbelief. He listened like one who was convinced, and\r\nresumed his narrative in his former solemn manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe came from the place where the sun is hid at night, over great plains\r\nwhere the buffaloes live, until we reached the big river. There we fought the\r\nAlligewi, till the ground was red with their blood. From the banks of the big\r\nriver to the shores of the salt lake, there was none to meet us. The Maquas\r\nfollowed at a distance. We said the country should be ours from the place where\r\nthe water runs up no longer on this stream, to a river twenty sun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njourney toward the summer. We drove the Maquas into the woods with the bears.\r\nThey only tasted salt at the licks; they drew no fish from the great lake; we\r\nthrew them the bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this I have heard and believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the white man, observing\r\nthat the Indian paused; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was long before the English came into the\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pine grew then where this chestnut now stands. The first pale faces\r\nwho came among us spoke no English. They came in a large canoe, when my fathers\r\nhad buried the tomahawk with the red men around them. Then, Hawkeye,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, betraying his deep emotion, only by permitting his voice to fall to\r\nthose low, guttural tones, which render his language, as spoken at times, so\r\nvery musical; \xe2\x80\x9cthen, Hawkeye, we were one people, and we were happy. The\r\nsalt lake gave us its fish, the wood its deer, and the air its birds. We took\r\nwives who bore us children; we worshipped the Great Spirit; and we kept the\r\nMaquas beyond the sound of our songs of triumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow you anything of your own family at that time?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the\r\nwhite. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are just a man, for an Indian; and as I suppose you hold\r\ntheir gifts, your fathers must have been brave warriors, and wise men at the\r\ncouncil-fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy tribe is the grandfather of nations, but I am an unmixed man. The\r\nblood of chiefs is in my veins, where it must stay forever. The Dutch landed,\r\nand gave my people the fire-water; they drank until the heavens and the earth\r\nseemed to meet, and they foolishly thought they had found the Great Spirit.\r\nThen they parted with their land. Foot by foot, they were driven back from the\r\nshores, until I, that am a chief and a Sagamore, have never seen the sun shine\r\nbut through the trees, and have never visited the graves of my fathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGraves bring solemn feelings over the mind,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, a\r\ngood deal touched at the calm suffering of his companion; \xe2\x80\x9cand they often\r\naid a man in his good intentions; though, for myself, I expect to leave my own\r\nbones unburied, to bleach in the woods, or to be torn asunder by the wolves.\r\nBut where are to be found those of your race who came to their kin in the\r\nDelaware country, so many summers since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the blossoms of those summers!\xe2\x80\x94fallen, one by one; so\r\nall of my family departed, each in his turn, to the land of spirits. I am on\r\nthe hilltop and must go down into the valley; and when Uncas follows in my\r\nfootsteps there will no longer be any of the blood of the Sagamores, for my boy\r\nis the last of the Mohicans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncas is here,\xe2\x80\x9d said another voice, in the same soft, guttural\r\ntones, near his elbow; \xe2\x80\x9cwho speaks to Uncas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe white man loosened his knife in his leathern sheath, and made an\r\ninvoluntary movement of the hand toward his rifle, at this sudden interruption;\r\nbut the Indian sat composed, and without turning his head at the unexpected\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nAt the next instant, a youthful warrior passed between them, with a noiseless\r\nstep, and seated himself on the bank of the rapid stream. No exclamation of\r\nsurprise escaped the father, nor was any question asked, or reply given, for\r\nseveral minutes; each appearing to await the moment when he might speak,\r\nwithout betraying womanish curiosity or childish impatience. The white man\r\nseemed to take counsel from their customs, and, relinquishing his grasp of the\r\nrifle, he also remained silent and reserved. At length Chingachgook turned his\r\neyes slowly toward his son, and demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo the Maquas dare to leave the print of their moccasins in these\r\nwoods?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been on their trail,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young Indian, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nknow that they number as many as the fingers of my two hands; but they lie hid\r\nlike cowards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thieves are outlying for scalps and plunder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the white\r\nman, whom we shall call Hawkeye, after the manner of his companions.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat busy Frenchman, Montcalm, will send his spies into our very camp,\r\nbut he will know what road we travel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis enough,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the father, glancing his eye toward\r\nthe setting sun; \xe2\x80\x9cthey shall be driven like deer from their bushes.\r\nHawkeye, let us eat to-night, and show the Maquas that we are men\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as ready to do the one as the other; but to fight the Iroquois\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis necessary to find the skulkers; and to eat, \xe2\x80\x99tis necessary to\r\nget the game\xe2\x80\x94talk of the devil and he will come; there is a pair of the\r\nbiggest antlers I have seen this season, moving the bushes below the hill! Now,\r\nUncas,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in a half whisper, and laughing with a kind of\r\ninward sound, like one who had learned to be watchful, \xe2\x80\x9cI will bet my\r\ncharger three times full of powder, against a foot of wampum, that I take him\r\natwixt the eyes, and nearer to the right than to the left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Indian, springing to his feet with\r\nyouthful eagerness; \xe2\x80\x9call but the tips of his horns are hid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the white man, shaking his head while he\r\nspoke, and addressing the father. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he think when a hunter sees a\r\npart of the creature\xe2\x80\x99, he can\xe2\x80\x99t tell where the rest of him should\r\nbe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdjusting his rifle, he was about to make an exhibition of that skill on which\r\nhe so much valued himself, when the warrior struck up the piece with his hand,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHawkeye! will you fight the Maquas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese Indians know the nature of the woods, as it might be by\r\ninstinct!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, dropping his rifle, and turning away like\r\na man who was convinced of his error. \xe2\x80\x9cI must leave the buck to your\r\narrow, Uncas, or we may kill a deer for them thieves, the Iroquois, to\r\neat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant the father seconded this intimation by an expressive gesture of the\r\nhand, Uncas threw himself on the ground, and approached the animal with wary\r\nmovements. When within a few yards of the cover, he fitted an arrow to his bow\r\nwith the utmost care, while the antlers moved, as if their owner snuffed an\r\nenemy in the tainted air. In another moment the twang of the cord was heard, a\r\nwhite streak was seen glancing into the bushes, and the wounded buck plunged\r\nfrom the cover, to the very feet of his hidden enemy. Avoiding the horns of the\r\ninfuriated animal, Uncas darted to his side, and passed his knife across the\r\nthroat, when bounding to the edge of the river it fell, dyeing the waters with\r\nits blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas done with Indian skill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout laughing\r\ninwardly, but with vast satisfaction; \xe2\x80\x9cand \xe2\x80\x99twas a pretty sight to\r\nbehold! Though an arrow is a near shot, and needs a knife to finish the\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated his companion, turning quickly, like a hound who\r\nscented game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Lord, there is a drove of them!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the scout, whose\r\neyes began to glisten with the ardor of his usual occupation; \xe2\x80\x9cif they\r\ncome within range of a bullet I will drop one, though the whole Six Nations\r\nshould be lurking within sound! What do you hear, Chingachgook? for to my ears\r\nthe woods are dumb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is but one deer, and he is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Indian, bending\r\nhis body till his ear nearly touched the earth. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear the sounds of\r\nfeet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the wolves have driven the buck to shelter, and are following on\r\nhis trail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The horses of white men are coming!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other,\r\nraising himself with dignity, and resuming his seat on the log with his former\r\ncomposure. \xe2\x80\x9cHawkeye, they are your brothers; speak to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will, and in English that the king needn\xe2\x80\x99t be ashamed to\r\nanswer,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the hunter, speaking in the language of which he\r\nboasted; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I see nothing, nor do I hear the sounds of man or beast;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis strange that an Indian should understand white sounds better than a\r\nman who, his very enemies will own, has no cross in his blood, although he may\r\nhave lived with the red skins long enough to be suspected! Ha! there goes\r\nsomething like the cracking of a dry stick, too\xe2\x80\x94now I hear the bushes\r\nmove\xe2\x80\x94yes, yes, there is a trampling that I mistook for the\r\nfalls\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94but here they come themselves; God keep them from the\r\nIroquois!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove\r\nTill I torment thee for this injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDream.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words were still in the mouth of the scout, when the leader of the party,\r\nwhose approaching footsteps had caught the vigilant ear of the Indian, came\r\nopenly into view. A beaten path, such as those made by the periodical passage\r\nof the deer, wound through a little glen at no great distance, and struck the\r\nriver at the point where the white man and his red companions had posted\r\nthemselves. Along this track the travelers, who had produced a surprise so\r\nunusual in the depths of the forest, advanced slowly toward the hunter, who was\r\nin front of his associates, in readiness to receive them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho comes?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the scout, throwing his rifle carelessly\r\nacross his left arm, and keeping the forefinger of his right hand on the\r\ntrigger, though he avoided all appearance of menace in the act. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\ncomes hither, among the beasts and dangers of the wilderness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelievers in religion, and friends to the law and to the king,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned he who rode foremost. \xe2\x80\x9cMen who have journeyed since the rising\r\nsun, in the shades of this forest, without nourishment, and are sadly tired of\r\ntheir wayfaring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are, then, lost,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the hunter, \xe2\x80\x9cand have\r\nfound how helpless \xe2\x80\x99tis not to know whether to take the right hand or the\r\nleft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so; sucking babes are not more dependent on those who guide them\r\nthan we who are of larger growth, and who may now be said to possess the\r\nstature without the knowledge of men. Know you the distance to a post of the\r\ncrown called William Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoot!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the scout, who did not spare his open laughter,\r\nthough instantly checking the dangerous sounds he indulged his merriment at\r\nless risk of being overheard by any lurking enemies. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are as much off\r\nthe scent as a hound would be, with Horican atwixt him and the deer! William\r\nHenry, man! if you are friends to the king and have business with the army,\r\nyour way would be to follow the river down to Edward, and lay the matter before\r\nWebb, who tarries there, instead of pushing into the defiles, and driving this\r\nsaucy Frenchman back across Champlain, into his den again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the stranger could make any reply to this unexpected proposition,\r\nanother horseman dashed the bushes aside, and leaped his charger into the\r\npathway, in front of his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then, may be our distance from Fort Edward?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded a new\r\nspeaker; \xe2\x80\x9cthe place you advise us to seek we left this morning, and our\r\ndestination is the head of the lake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must have lost your eyesight afore losing your way, for the\r\nroad across the portage is cut to a good two rods, and is as grand a path, I\r\ncalculate, as any that runs into London, or even before the palace of the king\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not dispute concerning the excellence of the passage,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Heyward, smiling; for, as the reader has anticipated, it was he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough, for the present, that we trusted to an Indian guide to\r\ntake us by a nearer, though blinder path, and that we are deceived in his\r\nknowledge. In plain words, we know not where we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn Indian lost in the woods!\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, shaking his head\r\ndoubtingly; \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the sun is scorching the tree tops, and the water\r\ncourses are full; when the moss on every beech he sees will tell him in what\r\nquarter the north star will shine at night. The woods are full of deer-paths\r\nwhich run to the streams and licks, places well known to everybody; nor have\r\nthe geese done their flight to the Canada waters altogether! \xe2\x80\x99Tis strange\r\nthat an Indian should be lost atwixt Horican and the bend in the river! Is he a\r\nMohawk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by birth, though adopted in that tribe; I think his birthplace was\r\nfarther north, and he is one of those you call a Huron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the two companions of the scout, who had\r\ncontinued until this part of the dialogue, seated immovable, and apparently\r\nindifferent to what passed, but who now sprang to their feet with an activity\r\nand interest that had evidently got the better of their reserve by surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Huron!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the sturdy scout, once more shaking his head in\r\nopen distrust; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are a thievish race, nor do I care by whom they are\r\nadopted; you can never make anything of them but skulks and vagabonds. Since\r\nyou trusted yourself to the care of one of that nation, I only wonder that you\r\nhave not fallen in with more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf that there is little danger, since William Henry is so many miles in\r\nour front. You forget that I have told you our guide is now a Mohawk, and that\r\nhe serves with our forces as a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you that he who is born a Mingo will die a Mingo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the other positively. \xe2\x80\x9cA Mohawk! No, give me a Delaware or a\r\nMohican for honesty; and when they will fight, which they won\xe2\x80\x99t all do,\r\nhaving suffered their cunning enemies, the Maquas, to make them women\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwhen they will fight at all, look to a Delaware, or a Mohican, for a\r\nwarrior!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish not to\r\ninquire into the character of a man that I know, and to whom you must be a\r\nstranger. You have not yet answered my question; what is our distance from the\r\nmain army at Edward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that may depend on who is your guide. One would think such a\r\nhorse as that might get over a good deal of ground atwixt sun-up and\r\nsun-down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish no contention of idle words with you, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHeyward, curbing his dissatisfied manner, and speaking in a more gentle voice;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you will tell me the distance to Fort Edward, and conduct me thither,\r\nyour labor shall not go without its reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in so doing, how know I that I don\xe2\x80\x99t guide an enemy and a spy\r\nof Montcalm, to the works of the army? It is not every man who can speak the\r\nEnglish tongue that is an honest subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you serve with the troops, of whom I judge you to be a scout, you\r\nshould know of such a regiment of the king as the Sixtieth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sixtieth! you can tell me little of the Royal Americans that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know, though I do wear a hunting-shirt instead of a scarlet\r\njacket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, among other things, you may know the name of its\r\nmajor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts major!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the hunter, elevating his body like one\r\nwho was proud of his trust. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a man in the country who knows\r\nMajor Effingham, he stands before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a corps which has many majors; the gentleman you name is the\r\nsenior, but I speak of the junior of them all; he who commands the companies in\r\ngarrison at William Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I have heard that a young gentleman of vast riches, from one\r\nof the provinces far south, has got the place. He is over young, too, to hold\r\nsuch rank, and to be put above men whose heads are beginning to bleach; and yet\r\nthey say he is a soldier in his knowledge, and a gallant gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever he may be, or however he may be qualified for his rank, he now\r\nspeaks to you and, of course, can be no enemy to dread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout regarded Heyward in surprise, and then lifting his cap, he answered,\r\nin a tone less confident than before\xe2\x80\x94though still expressing doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning for the\r\nlake shore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard the truth; but I preferred a nearer route, trusting to\r\nthe knowledge of the Indian I mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he deceived you, and then deserted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither, as I believe; certainly not the latter, for he is to be found\r\nin the rear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to look at the creature; if it is a true Iroquois I can\r\ntell him by his knavish look, and by his paint,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout; stepping\r\npast the charger of Heyward, and entering the path behind the mare of the\r\nsinging master, whose foal had taken advantage of the halt to exact the\r\nmaternal contribution. After shoving aside the bushes, and proceeding a few\r\npaces, he encountered the females, who awaited the result of the conference\r\nwith anxiety, and not entirely without apprehension. Behind these, the runner\r\nleaned against a tree, where he stood the close examination of the scout with\r\nan air unmoved, though with a look so dark and savage, that it might in itself\r\nexcite fear. Satisfied with his scrutiny, the hunter soon left him. As he\r\nrepassed the females, he paused a moment to gaze upon their beauty, answering\r\nto the smile and nod of Alice with a look of open pleasure. Thence he went to\r\nthe side of the motherly animal, and spending a minute in a fruitless inquiry\r\ninto the character of her rider, he shook his head and returned to Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Mingo is a Mingo, and God having made him so, neither the Mohawks nor\r\nany other tribe can alter him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when he had regained his former\r\nposition. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we were alone, and you would leave that noble horse at the\r\nmercy of the wolves to-night, I could show you the way to Edward myself, within\r\nan hour, for it lies only about an hour\xe2\x80\x99s journey hence; but with such\r\nladies in your company \xe2\x80\x99tis impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why? They are fatigued, but they are quite equal to a ride of a few\r\nmore miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a natural impossibility!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk a mile in these woods after night gets into them, in\r\ncompany with that runner, for the best rifle in the colonies. They are full of\r\noutlying Iroquois, and your mongrel Mohawk knows where to find them too well to\r\nbe my companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink you so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, leaning forward in the saddle, and\r\ndropping his voice nearly to a whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cI confess I have not been\r\nwithout my own suspicions, though I have endeavored to conceal them, and\r\naffected a confidence I have not always felt, on account of my companions. It\r\nwas because I suspected him that I would follow no longer; making him, as you\r\nsee, follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew he was one of the cheats as soon as I laid eyes on him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the scout, placing a finger on his nose, in sign of caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thief is leaning against the foot of the sugar sapling, that you can\r\nsee over them bushes; his right leg is in a line with the bark of the tree,\r\nand,\xe2\x80\x9d tapping his rifle, \xe2\x80\x9cI can take him from where I stand,\r\nbetween the angle and the knee, with a single shot, putting an end to his\r\ntramping through the woods, for at least a month to come. If I should go back\r\nto him, the cunning varmint would suspect something, and be dodging through the\r\ntrees like a frightened deer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not do. He may be innocent, and I dislike the act. Though, if I\r\nfelt confident of his treachery\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a safe thing to calculate on the knavery of an\r\nIroquois,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, throwing his rifle forward, by a sort of\r\ninstinctive movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Heyward, \xe2\x80\x9cit will not do\xe2\x80\x94we must\r\nthink of some other scheme\xe2\x80\x94and yet, I have much reason to believe the\r\nrascal has deceived me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hunter, who had already abandoned his intention of maiming the runner,\r\nmused a moment, and then made a gesture, which instantly brought his two red\r\ncompanions to his side. They spoke together earnestly in the Delaware language,\r\nthough in an undertone; and by the gestures of the white man, which were\r\nfrequently directed towards the top of the sapling, it was evident he pointed\r\nout the situation of their hidden enemy. His companions were not long in\r\ncomprehending his wishes, and laying aside their firearms, they parted, taking\r\nopposite sides of the path, and burying themselves in the thicket, with such\r\ncautious movements, that their steps were inaudible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, go you back,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hunter, speaking again to Heyward,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand hold the imp in talk; these Mohicans here will take him without\r\nbreaking his paint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cI will seize him\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist! what could you do, mounted, against an Indian in the\r\nbushes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will dismount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, think you, when he saw one of your feet out of the stirrup, he\r\nwould wait for the other to be free? Whoever comes into the woods to deal with\r\nthe natives, must use Indian fashions, if he would wish to prosper in his\r\nundertakings. Go, then; talk openly to the miscreant, and seem to believe him\r\nthe truest friend you have on \xe2\x80\x99arth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward prepared to comply, though with strong disgust at the nature of the\r\noffice he was compelled to execute. Each moment, however, pressed upon him a\r\nconviction of the critical situation in which he had suffered his invaluable\r\ntrust to be involved through his own confidence. The sun had already\r\ndisappeared, and the woods, suddenly deprived of his light[1],\r\nwere assuming a dusky hue, which keenly reminded him that the hour the savage\r\nusually chose for his most barbarous and remorseless acts of vengeance or\r\nhostility, was speedily drawing near. Stimulated by apprehension, he left the\r\nscout, who immediately entered into a loud conversation with the stranger that\r\nhad so unceremoniously enlisted himself in the party of travelers that morning.\r\nIn passing his gentler companions Heyward uttered a few words of encouragement,\r\nand was pleased to find that, though fatigued with the exercise of the day,\r\nthey appeared to entertain no suspicion that their present embarrassment was\r\nother than the result of accident. Giving them reason to believe he was merely\r\nemployed in a consultation concerning the future route, he spurred his charger,\r\nand drew the reins again when the animal had carried him within a few yards of\r\nthe place where the sullen runner still stood, leaning against the tree.\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nThe scene of this tale was in the 42d degree of latitude, where the twilight\r\nis never of long continuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may see, Magua,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, endeavoring to assume an air of\r\nfreedom and confidence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the night is closing around us, and yet we\r\nare no nearer to William Henry than when we left the encampment of Webb with\r\nthe rising sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have missed the way, nor have I been more fortunate. But, happily,\r\nwe have fallen in with a hunter, he whom you hear talking to the singer, that\r\nis acquainted with the deerpaths and by-ways of the woods, and who promises to\r\nlead us to a place where we may rest securely till the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian riveted his glowing eyes on Heyward as he asked, in his imperfect\r\nEnglish, \xe2\x80\x9cIs he alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone!\xe2\x80\x9d hesitatingly answered Heyward, to whom deception was too\r\nnew to be assumed without embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! not alone, surely, Magua,\r\nfor you know that we are with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Le Renard Subtil will go,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the runner, coolly\r\nraising his little wallet from the place where it had lain at his feet;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the pale faces will see none but their own color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo! Whom call you Le Renard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the name his Canada fathers have given to Magua,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the runner, with an air that manifested his pride at the distinction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNight is the same as day to Le Subtil, when Munro waits for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what account will Le Renard give the chief of William Henry\r\nconcerning his daughters? Will he dare to tell the hot-blooded Scotsman that\r\nhis children are left without a guide, though Magua promised to be one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough the gray head has a loud voice, and a long arm, Le Renard will\r\nnot hear him, nor feel him, in the woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what will the Mohawks say? They will make him petticoats, and bid\r\nhim stay in the wigwam with the women, for he is no longer to be trusted with\r\nthe business of a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Subtil knows the path to the great lakes, and he can find the bones\r\nof his fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer of the unmoved runner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, Magua,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9care we not friends? Why\r\nshould there be bitter words between us? Munro has promised you a gift for your\r\nservices when performed, and I shall be your debtor for another. Rest your\r\nweary limbs, then, and open your wallet to eat. We have a few moments to spare;\r\nlet us not waste them in talk like wrangling women. When the ladies are\r\nrefreshed we will proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pale faces make themselves dogs to their women,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the\r\nIndian, in his native language, \xe2\x80\x9cand when they want to eat, their\r\nwarriors must lay aside the tomahawk to feed their laziness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat say you, Renard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Subtil says it is good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian then fastened his eyes keenly on the open countenance of Heyward,\r\nbut meeting his glance, he turned them quickly away, and seating himself\r\ndeliberately on the ground, he drew forth the remnant of some former repast,\r\nand began to eat, though not without first bending his looks slowly and\r\ncautiously around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is well,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cand Le Renard will have\r\nstrength and sight to find the path in the morning\xe2\x80\x9d; he paused, for\r\nsounds like the snapping of a dried stick, and the rustling of leaves, rose\r\nfrom the adjacent bushes, but recollecting himself instantly, he continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe must be moving before the sun is seen, or Montcalm may lie in our\r\npath, and shut us out from the fortress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hand of Magua dropped from his mouth to his side, and though his eyes were\r\nfastened on the ground, his head was turned aside, his nostrils expanded, and\r\nhis ears seemed even to stand more erect than usual, giving to him the\r\nappearance of a statue that was made to represent intense attention.\r\n\r\nHeyward, who watched his movements with a vigilant eye, carelessly extricated\r\none of his feet from the stirrup, while he passed a hand toward the bear-skin\r\ncovering of his holsters.\r\n\r\nEvery effort to detect the point most regarded by the runner was completely\r\nfrustrated by the tremulous glances of his organs, which seemed not to rest a\r\nsingle instant on any particular object, and which, at the same time, could be\r\nhardly said to move. While he hesitated how to proceed, Le Subtil cautiously\r\nraised himself to his feet, though with a motion so slow and guarded, that not\r\nthe slightest noise was produced by the change. Heyward felt it had now become\r\nincumbent on him to act. Throwing his leg over the saddle, he dismounted, with\r\na determination to advance and seize his treacherous companion, trusting the\r\nresult to his own manhood. In order, however, to prevent unnecessary alarm, he\r\nstill preserved an air of calmness and friendship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Renard Subtil does not eat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, using the appellation he\r\nhad found most flattering to the vanity of the Indian. \xe2\x80\x9cHis corn is not\r\nwell parched, and it seems dry. Let me examine; perhaps something may be found\r\namong my own provisions that will help his appetite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua held out the wallet to the proffer of the other. He even suffered their\r\nhands to meet, without betraying the least emotion, or varying his riveted\r\nattitude of attention. But when he felt the fingers of Heyward moving gently\r\nalong his own naked arm, he struck up the limb of the young man, and, uttering\r\na piercing cry, he darted beneath it, and plunged, at a single bound, into the\r\nopposite thicket. At the next instant the form of Chingachgook appeared from\r\nthe bushes, looking like a specter in its paint, and glided across the path in\r\nswift pursuit. Next followed the shout of Uncas, when the woods were lighted by\r\na sudden flash, that was accompanied by the sharp report of the hunter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n...\xe2\x80\x9dIn such a night\r\nDid This be fearfully o\xe2\x80\x99ertrip the dew;\r\nAnd saw the lion\xe2\x80\x99s shadow ere himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of the flight of his guide, and the wild cries of the pursuers,\r\ncaused Heyward to remain fixed, for a few moments, in inactive surprise. Then\r\nrecollecting the importance of securing the fugitive, he dashed aside the\r\nsurrounding bushes, and pressed eagerly forward to lend his aid in the chase.\r\nBefore he had, however, proceeded a hundred yards, he met the three foresters\r\nalready returning from their unsuccessful pursuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so soon disheartened!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cthe scoundrel must\r\nbe concealed behind some of these trees, and may yet be secured. We are not\r\nsafe while he goes at large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you set a cloud to chase the wind?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\ndisappointed scout; \xe2\x80\x9cI heard the imp brushing over the dry leaves, like a\r\nblack snake, and blinking a glimpse of him, just over ag\xe2\x80\x99in yon big pine,\r\nI pulled as it might be on the scent; but \xe2\x80\x99twouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do! and yet\r\nfor a reasoning aim, if anybody but myself had touched the trigger, I should\r\ncall it a quick sight; and I may be accounted to have experience in these\r\nmatters, and one who ought to know. Look at this sumach; its leaves are red,\r\nthough everybody knows the fruit is in the yellow blossom in the month of\r\nJuly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the blood of Le Subtil! he is hurt, and may yet fall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, in decided disapprobation of this\r\nopinion, \xe2\x80\x9cI rubbed the bark off a limb, perhaps, but the creature leaped\r\nthe longer for it. A rifle bullet acts on a running animal, when it barks him,\r\nmuch the same as one of your spurs on a horse; that is, it quickens motion, and\r\nputs life into the flesh, instead of taking it away. But when it cuts the\r\nragged hole, after a bound or two, there is, commonly, a stagnation of further\r\nleaping, be it Indian or be it deer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are four able bodies, to one wounded man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs life grievous to you?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cYonder red\r\ndevil would draw you within swing of the tomahawks of his comrades, before you\r\nwere heated in the chase. It was an unthoughtful act in a man who has so often\r\nslept with the war-whoop ringing in the air, to let off his piece within sound\r\nof an ambushment! But then it was a natural temptation! \xe2\x80\x99twas very\r\nnatural! Come, friends, let us move our station, and in such fashion, too, as\r\nwill throw the cunning of a Mingo on a wrong scent, or our scalps will be\r\ndrying in the wind in front of Montcalm\xe2\x80\x99s marquee, ag\xe2\x80\x99in this hour\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appalling declaration, which the scout uttered with the cool assurance of\r\na man who fully comprehended, while he did not fear to face the danger, served\r\nto remind Heyward of the importance of the charge with which he himself had\r\nbeen intrusted. Glancing his eyes around, with a vain effort to pierce the\r\ngloom that was thickening beneath the leafy arches of the forest, he felt as\r\nif, cut off from human aid, his unresisting companions would soon lie at the\r\nentire mercy of those barbarous enemies, who, like beasts of prey, only waited\r\ntill the gathering darkness might render their blows more fatally certain. His\r\nawakened imagination, deluded by the deceptive light, converted each waving\r\nbush, or the fragment of some fallen tree, into human forms, and twenty times\r\nhe fancied he could distinguish the horrid visages of his lurking foes, peering\r\nfrom their hiding places, in never ceasing watchfulness of the movements of his\r\nparty. Looking upward, he found that the thin fleecy clouds, which evening had\r\npainted on the blue sky, were already losing their faintest tints of\r\nrose-color, while the imbedded stream, which glided past the spot where he\r\nstood, was to be traced only by the dark boundary of its wooded banks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, feeling the utter helplessness of\r\ndoubt in such a pressing strait; \xe2\x80\x9cdesert me not, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\r\nremain to defend those I escort, and freely name your own reward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companions, who conversed apart in the language of their tribe, heeded not\r\nthis sudden and earnest appeal. Though their dialogue was maintained in low and\r\ncautious sounds, but little above a whisper, Heyward, who now approached, could\r\neasily distinguish the earnest tones of the younger warrior from the more\r\ndeliberate speeches of his seniors. It was evident that they debated on the\r\npropriety of some measure, that nearly concerned the welfare of the travelers.\r\nYielding to his powerful interest in the subject, and impatient of a delay that\r\nseemed fraught with so much additional danger, Heyward drew still nigher to the\r\ndusky group, with an intention of making his offers of compensation more\r\ndefinite, when the white man, motioning with his hand, as if he conceded the\r\ndisputed point, turned away, saying in a sort of soliloquy, and in the English\r\ntongue:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncas is right! it would not be the act of men to leave such harmless\r\nthings to their fate, even though it breaks up the harboring place forever. If\r\nyou would save these tender blossoms from the fangs of the worst of serpents,\r\ngentleman, you have neither time to lose nor resolution to throw away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can such a wish be doubted! Have I not already offered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOffer your prayers to Him who can give us wisdom to circumvent the\r\ncunning of the devils who fill these woods,\xe2\x80\x9d calmly interrupted the\r\nscout, \xe2\x80\x9cbut spare your offers of money, which neither you may live to\r\nrealize, nor I to profit by. These Mohicans and I will do what man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoughts can invent, to keep such flowers, which, though so sweet, were never\r\nmade for the wilderness, from harm, and that without hope of any other\r\nrecompense but such as God always gives to upright dealings. First, you must\r\npromise two things, both in your own name and for your friends, or without\r\nserving you we shall only injure ourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one is, to be still as these sleeping woods, let what will happen\r\nand the other is, to keep the place where we shall take you, forever a secret\r\nfrom all mortal men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do my utmost to see both these conditions fulfilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen follow, for we are losing moments that are as precious as the\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s blood to a stricken deer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward could distinguish the impatient gesture of the scout, through the\r\nincreasing shadows of the evening, and he moved in his footsteps, swiftly,\r\ntoward the place where he had left the remainder of the party. When they\r\nrejoined the expecting and anxious females, he briefly acquainted them with the\r\nconditions of their new guide, and with the necessity that existed for their\r\nhushing every apprehension in instant and serious exertions. Although his\r\nalarming communication was not received without much secret terror by the\r\nlisteners, his earnest and impressive manner, aided perhaps by the nature of\r\nthe danger, succeeded in bracing their nerves to undergo some unlooked-for and\r\nunusual trial. Silently, and without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay, they permitted him\r\nto assist them from their saddles, and when they descended quickly to the\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x99s edge, where the scout had collected the rest of the party, more\r\nby the agency of expressive gestures than by any use of words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat to do with these dumb creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the white man, on\r\nwhom the sole control of their future movements appeared to devolve; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwould be time lost to cut their throats, and cast them into the river; and to\r\nleave them here would be to tell the Mingoes that they have not far to seek to\r\nfind their owners!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen give them their bridles, and let them range the woods,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHeyward ventured to suggest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it would be better to mislead the imps, and make them believe they\r\nmust equal a horse\xe2\x80\x99s speed to run down their chase. Ay, ay, that will\r\nblind their fireballs of eyes! Chingach\xe2\x80\x94Hist! what stirs the bush?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe colt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat colt, at least, must die,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the scout, grasping at\r\nthe mane of the nimble beast, which easily eluded his hand; \xe2\x80\x9cUncas, your\r\narrows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the proprietor of the condemned animal, aloud,\r\nwithout regard to the whispering tones used by the others; \xe2\x80\x9cspare the\r\nfoal of Miriam! it is the comely offspring of a faithful dam, and would\r\nwillingly injure naught.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen men struggle for the single life God has given them,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe scout, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9ceven their own kind seem no more than the beasts of\r\nthe wood. If you speak again, I shall leave you to the mercy of the Maquas!\r\nDraw to your arrow\xe2\x80\x99s head, Uncas; we have no time for second\r\nblows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe low, muttering sounds of his threatening voice were still audible, when the\r\nwounded foal, first rearing on its hinder legs, plunged forward to its knees.\r\nIt was met by Chingachgook, whose knife passed across its throat quicker than\r\nthought, and then precipitating the motions of the struggling victim, he dashed\r\ninto the river, down whose stream it glided away, gasping audibly for breath\r\nwith its ebbing life. This deed of apparent cruelty, but of real necessity,\r\nfell upon the spirits of the travelers like a terrific warning of the peril in\r\nwhich they stood, heightened as it was by the calm though steady resolution of\r\nthe actors in the scene. The sisters shuddered and clung closer to each other,\r\nwhile Heyward instinctively laid his hand on one of the pistols he had just\r\ndrawn from their holsters, as he placed himself between his charge and those\r\ndense shadows that seemed to draw an impenetrable veil before the bosom of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, however, hesitated not a moment, but taking the bridles, they led\r\nthe frightened and reluctant horses into the bed of the river.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the shore they turned, and were soon concealed by the\r\nprojection of the bank, under the brow of which they moved, in a direction\r\nopposite to the course of the waters. In the meantime, the scout drew a canoe\r\nof bark from its place of concealment beneath some low bushes, whose branches\r\nwere waving with the eddies of the current, into which he silently motioned for\r\nthe females to enter. They complied without hesitation, though many a fearful\r\nand anxious glance was thrown behind them, toward the thickening gloom, which\r\nnow lay like a dark barrier along the margin of the stream.\r\n\r\nSo soon as Cora and Alice were seated, the scout, without regarding the\r\nelement, directed Heyward to support one side of the frail vessel, and posting\r\nhimself at the other, they bore it up against the stream, followed by the\r\ndejected owner of the dead foal. In this manner they proceeded, for many rods,\r\nin a silence that was only interrupted by the rippling of the water, as its\r\neddies played around them, or the low dash made by their own cautious\r\nfootsteps. Heyward yielded the guidance of the canoe implicitly to the scout,\r\nwho approached or receded from the shore, to avoid the fragments of rocks, or\r\ndeeper parts of the river, with a readiness that showed his knowledge of the\r\nroute they held. Occasionally he would stop; and in the midst of a breathing\r\nstillness, that the dull but increasing roar of the waterfall only served to\r\nrender more impressive, he would listen with painful intenseness, to catch any\r\nsounds that might arise from the slumbering forest. When assured that all was\r\nstill, and unable to detect, even by the aid of his practiced senses, any sign\r\nof his approaching foes, he would deliberately resume his slow and guarded\r\nprogress. At length they reached a point in the river where the roving eye of\r\nHeyward became riveted on a cluster of black objects, collected at a spot where\r\nthe high bank threw a deeper shadow than usual on the dark waters. Hesitating\r\nto advance, he pointed out the place to the attention of his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the composed scout, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Indians have hid the\r\nbeasts with the judgment of natives! Water leaves no trail, and an owl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes would be blinded by the darkness of such a hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole party was soon reunited, and another consultation was held between\r\nthe scout and his new comrades, during which, they, whose fates depended on the\r\nfaith and ingenuity of these unknown foresters, had a little leisure to observe\r\ntheir situation more minutely.\r\n\r\nThe river was confined between high and cragged rocks, one of which impended\r\nabove the spot where the canoe rested. As these, again, were surmounted by tall\r\ntrees, which appeared to totter on the brows of the precipice, it gave the\r\nstream the appearance of running through a deep and narrow dell. All beneath\r\nthe fantastic limbs and ragged tree tops, which were, here and there, dimly\r\npainted against the starry zenith, lay alike in shadowed obscurity. Behind\r\nthem, the curvature of the banks soon bounded the view by the same dark and\r\nwooded outline; but in front, and apparently at no great distance, the water\r\nseemed piled against the heavens, whence it tumbled into caverns, out of which\r\nissued those sullen sounds that had loaded the evening atmosphere. It seemed,\r\nin truth, to be a spot devoted to seclusion, and the sisters imbibed a soothing\r\nimpression of security, as they gazed upon its romantic though not unappalling\r\nbeauties. A general movement among their conductors, however, soon recalled\r\nthem from a contemplation of the wild charms that night had assisted to lend\r\nthe place to a painful sense of their real peril.\r\n\r\nThe horses had been secured to some scattering shrubs that grew in the fissures\r\nof the rocks, where, standing in the water, they were left to pass the night.\r\nThe scout directed Heyward and his disconsolate fellow travelers to seat\r\nthemselves in the forward end of the canoe, and took possession of the other\r\nhimself, as erect and steady as if he floated in a vessel of much firmer\r\nmaterials. The Indians warily retraced their steps toward the place they had\r\nleft, when the scout, placing his pole against a rock, by a powerful shove,\r\nsent his frail bark directly into the turbulent stream. For many minutes the\r\nstruggle between the light bubble in which they floated and the swift current\r\nwas severe and doubtful. Forbidden to stir even a hand, and almost afraid to\r\nbreath, lest they should expose the frail fabric to the fury of the stream, the\r\npassengers watched the glancing waters in feverish suspense. Twenty times they\r\nthought the whirling eddies were sweeping them to destruction, when the\r\nmaster-hand of their pilot would bring the bows of the canoe to stem the rapid.\r\nA long, a vigorous, and, as it appeared to the females, a desperate effort,\r\nclosed the struggle. Just as Alice veiled her eyes in horror, under the\r\nimpression that they were about to be swept within the vortex at the foot of\r\nthe cataract, the canoe floated, stationary, at the side of a flat rock, that\r\nlay on a level with the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we, and what is next to be done!\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward,\r\nperceiving that the exertions of the scout had ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are at the foot of Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other,\r\nspeaking aloud, without fear of consequences within the roar of the cataract;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the next thing is to make a steady landing, lest the canoe upset,\r\nand you should go down again the hard road we have traveled faster than you\r\ncame up; \xe2\x80\x99tis a hard rift to stem, when the river is a little swelled;\r\nand five is an unnatural number to keep dry, in a hurry-skurry, with a little\r\nbirchen bark and gum. There, go you all on the rock, and I will bring up the\r\nMohicans with the venison. A man had better sleep without his scalp, than\r\nfamish in the midst of plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis passengers gladly complied with these directions. As the last foot touched\r\nthe rock, the canoe whirled from its station, when the tall form of the scout\r\nwas seen, for an instant, gliding above the waters, before it disappeared in\r\nthe impenetrable darkness that rested on the bed of the river. Left by their\r\nguide, the travelers remained a few minutes in helpless ignorance, afraid even\r\nto move along the broken rocks, lest a false step should precipitate them down\r\nsome one of the many deep and roaring caverns, into which the water seemed to\r\ntumble, on every side of them. Their suspense, however, was soon relieved; for,\r\naided by the skill of the natives, the canoe shot back into the eddy, and\r\nfloated again at the side of the low rock, before they thought the scout had\r\neven time to rejoin his companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are now fortified, garrisoned, and provisioned,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Heyward\r\ncheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand may set Montcalm and his allies at defiance. How, now,\r\nmy vigilant sentinel, can see anything of those you call the Iroquois, on the\r\nmain land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call them Iroquois, because to me every native, who speaks a foreign\r\ntongue, is accounted an enemy, though he may pretend to serve the king! If Webb\r\nwants faith and honesty in an Indian, let him bring out the tribes of the\r\nDelawares, and send these greedy and lying Mohawks and Oneidas, with their six\r\nnations of varlets, where in nature they belong, among the French!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should then exchange a warlike for a useless friend! I have heard\r\nthat the Delawares have laid aside the hatchet, and are content to be called\r\nwomen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, shame on the Hollanders and Iroquois, who circumvented them by\r\ntheir deviltries, into such a treaty! But I have known them for twenty years,\r\nand I call him liar that says cowardly blood runs in the veins of a Delaware.\r\nYou have driven their tribes from the seashore, and would now believe what\r\ntheir enemies say, that you may sleep at night upon an easy pillow. No, no; to\r\nme, every Indian who speaks a foreign tongue is an Iroquois, whether the\r\ncastle[1] of his\r\ntribe be in Canada, or be in York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nThe principal villages of the Indians are still called \xe2\x80\x9ccastles\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nby the whites of New York. \xe2\x80\x9cOneida castle\xe2\x80\x9d is no more than a\r\nscattered hamlet; but the name is in general use.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeyward, perceiving that the stubborn adherence of the scout to the cause of\r\nhis friends the Delawares, or Mohicans, for they were branches of the same\r\nnumerous people, was likely to prolong a useless discussion, changed the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTreaty or no treaty, I know full well that your two companions are brave\r\nand cautious warriors! have they heard or seen anything of our enemies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn Indian is a mortal to be felt afore he is seen,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nscout, ascending the rock, and throwing the deer carelessly down. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntrust to other signs than such as come in at the eye, when I am outlying on the\r\ntrail of the Mingoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry to think they had, though this is a spot that stout\r\ncourage might hold for a smart scrimmage. I will not deny, however, but the\r\nhorses cowered when I passed them, as though they scented the wolves; and a\r\nwolf is a beast that is apt to hover about an Indian ambushment, craving the\r\noffals of the deer the savages kill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget the buck at your feet! or, may we not owe their visit to the\r\ndead colt? Ha! what noise is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the stranger; \xe2\x80\x9cthy foal was\r\nforeordained to become a prey to ravenous beasts!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, suddenly lifting\r\nup his voice, amid the eternal din of the waters, he sang aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst born of Egypt, smite did he,\r\nOf mankind, and of beast also:\r\nO, Egypt! wonders sent \xe2\x80\x99midst thee,\r\nOn Pharaoh and his servants too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe death of the colt sits heavy on the heart of its owner,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe scout; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign to see a man account upon his dumb\r\nfriends. He has the religion of the matter, in believing what is to happen will\r\nhappen; and with such a consolation, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be long afore he submits to\r\nthe rationality of killing a four-footed beast to save the lives of human men.\r\nIt may be as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, reverting to the purport of\r\nHeyward\xe2\x80\x99s last remark; \xe2\x80\x9cand the greater the reason why we should\r\ncut our steaks, and let the carcass drive down the stream, or we shall have the\r\npack howling along the cliffs, begrudging every mouthful we swallow. Besides,\r\nthough the Delaware tongue is the same as a book to the Iroquois, the cunning\r\nvarlets are quick enough at understanding the reason of a wolf\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhowl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout, while making his remarks, was busied in collecting certain necessary\r\nimplements; as he concluded, he moved silently by the group of travelers,\r\naccompanied by the Mohicans, who seemed to comprehend his intentions with\r\ninstinctive readiness, when the whole three disappeared in succession, seeming\r\nto vanish against the dark face of a perpendicular rock that rose to the height\r\nof a few yards, within as many feet of the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose strains that once did sweet in Zion glide;\r\nHe wales a portion with judicious care;\r\nAnd \xe2\x80\x98Let us worship God\xe2\x80\x99, he says, with solemn\r\nair.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Burns\r\n\r\n\r\nHeyward and his female companions witnessed this mysterious movement with\r\nsecret uneasiness; for, though the conduct of the white man had hitherto been\r\nabove reproach, his rude equipments, blunt address, and strong antipathies,\r\ntogether with the character of his silent associates, were all causes for\r\nexciting distrust in minds that had been so recently alarmed by Indian\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\nThe stranger alone disregarded the passing incidents. He seated himself on a\r\nprojection of the rocks, whence he gave no other signs of consciousness than by\r\nthe struggles of his spirit, as manifested in frequent and heavy sighs.\r\nSmothered voices were next heard, as though men called to each other in the\r\nbowels of the earth, when a sudden light flashed upon those without, and laid\r\nbare the much-prized secret of the place.\r\n\r\nAt the further extremity of a narrow, deep cavern in the rock, whose length\r\nappeared much extended by the perspective and the nature of the light by which\r\nit was seen, was seated the scout, holding a blazing knot of pine. The strong\r\nglare of the fire fell full upon his sturdy, weather-beaten countenance and\r\nforest attire, lending an air of romantic wildness to the aspect of an\r\nindividual, who, seen by the sober light of day, would have exhibited the\r\npeculiarities of a man remarkable for the strangeness of his dress, the\r\niron-like inflexibility of his frame, and the singular compound of quick,\r\nvigilant sagacity, and of exquisite simplicity, that by turns usurped the\r\npossession of his muscular features. At a little distance in advance stood\r\nUncas, his whole person thrown powerfully into view. The travelers anxiously\r\nregarded the upright, flexible figure of the young Mohican, graceful and\r\nunrestrained in the attitudes and movements of nature. Though his person was\r\nmore than usually screened by a green and fringed hunting-shirt, like that of\r\nthe white man, there was no concealment to his dark, glancing, fearless eye,\r\nalike terrible and calm; the bold outline of his high, haughty features, pure\r\nin their native red; or to the dignified elevation of his receding forehead,\r\ntogether with all the finest proportions of a noble head, bared to the generous\r\nscalping tuft. It was the first opportunity possessed by Duncan and his\r\ncompanions to view the marked lineaments of either of their Indian attendants,\r\nand each individual of the party felt relieved from a burden of doubt, as the\r\nproud and determined, though wild expression of the features of the young\r\nwarrior forced itself on their notice. They felt it might be a being partially\r\nbenighted in the vale of ignorance, but it could not be one who would willingly\r\ndevote his rich natural gifts to the purposes of wanton treachery. The\r\ningenuous Alice gazed at his free air and proud carriage, as she would have\r\nlooked upon some precious relic of the Grecian chisel, to which life had been\r\nimparted by the intervention of a miracle; while Heyward, though accustomed to\r\nsee the perfection of form which abounds among the uncorrupted natives, openly\r\nexpressed his admiration at such an unblemished specimen of the noblest\r\nproportions of man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could sleep in peace,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Alice, in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cwith\r\nsuch a fearless and generous-looking youth for my sentinel. Surely, Duncan,\r\nthose cruel murders, those terrific scenes of torture, of which we read and\r\nhear so much, are never acted in the presence of such as he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis certainly is a rare and brilliant instance of those natural\r\nqualities in which these peculiar people are said to excel,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you, Alice, in thinking that such a front and eye were\r\nformed rather to intimidate than to deceive; but let us not practice a\r\ndeception upon ourselves, by expecting any other exhibition of what we esteem\r\nvirtue than according to the fashion of the savage. As bright examples of great\r\nqualities are but too uncommon among Christians, so are they singular and\r\nsolitary with the Indians; though, for the honor of our common nature, neither\r\nare incapable of producing them. Let us then hope that this Mohican may not\r\ndisappoint our wishes, but prove what his looks assert him to be, a brave and\r\nconstant friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow Major Heyward speaks as Major Heyward should,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho that looks at this creature of nature, remembers the shade of his\r\nskin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA short and apparently an embarrassed silence succeeded this remark, which was\r\ninterrupted by the scout calling to them, aloud, to enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fire begins to show too bright a flame,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as\r\nthey complied, \xe2\x80\x9cand might light the Mingoes to our undoing. Uncas, drop\r\nthe blanket, and show the knaves its dark side. This is not such a supper as a\r\nmajor of the Royal Americans has a right to expect, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve known stout\r\ndetachments of the corps glad to eat their venison raw, and without a relish,\r\ntoo[1]. Here, you\r\nsee, we have plenty of salt, and can make a quick broil. There\xe2\x80\x99s fresh\r\nsassafras boughs for the ladies to sit on, which may not be as proud as their\r\nmy-hog-guinea chairs, but which sends up a sweeter flavor, than the skin of any\r\nhog can do, be it of Guinea, or be it of any other land. Come, friend,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be mournful for the colt; \xe2\x80\x99twas an innocent thing, and had\r\nnot seen much hardship. Its death will save the creature many a sore back and\r\nweary foot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nIn vulgar parlance the condiments of a repast are called by the American\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca relish,\xe2\x80\x9d substituting the thing for its effect. These provincial\r\nterms are frequently put in the mouths of the speakers, according to their\r\nseveral conditions in life. Most of them are of local use, and others quite\r\npeculiar to the particular class of men to which the character belongs. In the\r\npresent instance, the scout uses the word with immediate reference to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csalt,\xe2\x80\x9d with which his own party was so fortunate as to be\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncas did as the other had directed, and when the voice of Hawkeye ceased, the\r\nroar of the cataract sounded like the rumbling of distant thunder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we quite safe in this cavern?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthere no danger of surprise? A single armed man, at its entrance, would hold us\r\nat his mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA spectral-looking figure stalked from out of the darkness behind the scout,\r\nand seizing a blazing brand, held it toward the further extremity of their\r\nplace of retreat. Alice uttered a faint shriek, and even Cora rose to her feet,\r\nas this appalling object moved into the light; but a single word from Heyward\r\ncalmed them, with the assurance it was only their attendant, Chingachgook, who,\r\nlifting another blanket, discovered that the cavern had two outlets. Then,\r\nholding the brand, he crossed a deep, narrow chasm in the rocks which ran at\r\nright angles with the passage they were in, but which, unlike that, was open to\r\nthe heavens, and entered another cave, answering to the description of the\r\nfirst, in every essential particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch old foxes as Chingachgook and myself are not often caught in a\r\nbarrow with one hole,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can easily see\r\nthe cunning of the place\xe2\x80\x94the rock is black limestone, which everybody\r\nknows is soft; it makes no uncomfortable pillow, where brush and pine wood is\r\nscarce; well, the fall was once a few yards below us, and I dare to say was, in\r\nits time, as regular and as handsome a sheet of water as any along the Hudson.\r\nBut old age is a great injury to good looks, as these sweet young ladies have\r\nyet to l\xe2\x80\x99arn! The place is sadly changed! These rocks are full of cracks,\r\nand in some places they are softer than at othersome, and the water has worked\r\nout deep hollows for itself, until it has fallen back, ay, some hundred feet,\r\nbreaking here and wearing there, until the falls have neither shape nor\r\nconsistency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what part of them are we?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we are nigh the spot that Providence first placed them at, but\r\nwhere, it seems, they were too rebellious to stay. The rock proved softer on\r\neach side of us, and so they left the center of the river bare and dry, first\r\nworking out these two little holes for us to hide in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are then on an island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! there are the falls on two sides of us, and the river above and\r\nbelow. If you had daylight, it would be worth the trouble to step up on the\r\nheight of this rock, and look at the perversity of the water. It falls by no\r\nrule at all; sometimes it leaps, sometimes it tumbles; there it skips; here it\r\nshoots; in one place \xe2\x80\x99tis white as snow, and in another \xe2\x80\x99tis green\r\nas grass; hereabouts, it pitches into deep hollows, that rumble and crush the\r\n\xe2\x80\x99arth; and thereaways, it ripples and sings like a brook, fashioning\r\nwhirlpools and gullies in the old stone, as if \xe2\x80\x99twas no harder than\r\ntrodden clay. The whole design of the river seems disconcerted. First it runs\r\nsmoothly, as if meaning to go down the descent as things were ordered; then it\r\nangles about and faces the shores; nor are there places wanting where it looks\r\nbackward, as if unwilling to leave the wilderness, to mingle with the salt. Ay,\r\nlady, the fine cobweb-looking cloth you wear at your throat is coarse, and like\r\na fishnet, to little spots I can show you, where the river fabricates all sorts\r\nof images, as if having broke loose from order, it would try its hand at\r\neverything. And yet what does it amount to! After the water has been suffered\r\nso to have its will, for a time, like a headstrong man, it is gathered together\r\nby the hand that made it, and a few rods below you may see it all, flowing on\r\nsteadily toward the sea, as was foreordained from the first foundation of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x99arth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile his auditors received a cheering assurance of the security of their place\r\nof concealment from this untutored description of Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s,[2]\r\nthey were much inclined to judge differently from Hawkeye, of its wild\r\nbeauties. But they were not in a situation to suffer their thoughts to dwell on\r\nthe charms of natural objects; and, as the scout had not found it necessary to\r\ncease his culinary labors while he spoke, unless to point out, with a broken\r\nfork, the direction of some particularly obnoxious point in the rebellious\r\nstream, they now suffered their attention to be drawn to the necessary though\r\nmore vulgar consideration of their supper.\r\n\r\n [2]\r\nGlenn\xe2\x80\x99s Falls are on the Hudson, some forty or fifty miles above the\r\nhead of tide, or that place where the river becomes navigable for sloops. The\r\ndescription of this picturesque and remarkable little cataract, as given by the\r\nscout, is sufficiently correct, though the application of the water to uses of\r\ncivilized life has materially injured its beauties. The rocky island and the\r\ntwo caverns are known to every traveler, since the former sustains the pier of\r\na bridge, which is now thrown across the river, immediately above the fall. In\r\nexplanation of the taste of Hawkeye, it should be remembered that men always\r\nprize that most which is least enjoyed. Thus, in a new country, the woods and\r\nother objects, which in an old country would be maintained at great cost, are\r\ngot rid of, simply with a view of \xe2\x80\x9cimproving\xe2\x80\x9d as it is called.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe repast, which was greatly aided by the addition of a few delicacies that\r\nHeyward had the precaution to bring with him when they left their horses, was\r\nexceedingly refreshing to the weary party. Uncas acted as attendant to the\r\nfemales, performing all the little offices within his power, with a mixture of\r\ndignity and anxious grace, that served to amuse Heyward, who well knew that it\r\nwas an utter innovation on the Indian customs, which forbid their warriors to\r\ndescend to any menial employment, especially in favor of their women. As the\r\nrights of hospitality were, however, considered sacred among them, this little\r\ndeparture from the dignity of manhood excited no audible comment. Had there\r\nbeen one there sufficiently disengaged to become a close observer, he might\r\nhave fancied that the services of the young chief were not entirely impartial.\r\nThat while he tendered to Alice the gourd of sweet water, and the venison in a\r\ntrencher, neatly carved from the knot of the pepperidge, with sufficient\r\ncourtesy, in performing the same offices to her sister, his dark eye lingered\r\non her rich, speaking countenance. Once or twice he was compelled to speak, to\r\ncommand the attention of those he served. In such cases he made use of English,\r\nbroken and imperfect, but sufficiently intelligible, and which he rendered so\r\nmild and musical, by his deep, guttural voice, that it never failed to cause\r\nboth ladies to look up in admiration and astonishment. In the course of these\r\ncivilities, a few sentences were exchanged, that served to establish the\r\nappearance of an amicable intercourse between the parties.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the gravity of Chingcachgook remained immovable. He had\r\nseated himself more within the circle of light, where the frequent, uneasy\r\nglances of his guests were better enabled to separate the natural expression of\r\nhis face from the artificial terrors of the war paint. They found a strong\r\nresemblance between father and son, with the difference that might be expected\r\nfrom age and hardships. The fierceness of his countenance now seemed to\r\nslumber, and in its place was to be seen the quiet, vacant composure which\r\ndistinguishes an Indian warrior, when his faculties are not required for any of\r\nthe greater purposes of his existence. It was, however, easy to be seen, by the\r\noccasional gleams that shot across his swarthy visage, that it was only\r\nnecessary to arouse his passions, in order to give full effect to the terrific\r\ndevice which he had adopted to intimidate his enemies. On the other hand, the\r\nquick, roving eye of the scout seldom rested. He ate and drank with an appetite\r\nthat no sense of danger could disturb, but his vigilance seemed never to desert\r\nhim. Twenty times the gourd or the venison was suspended before his lips, while\r\nhis head was turned aside, as though he listened to some distant and distrusted\r\nsounds\xe2\x80\x94a movement that never failed to recall his guests from regarding\r\nthe novelties of their situation, to a recollection of the alarming reasons\r\nthat had driven them to seek it. As these frequent pauses were never followed\r\nby any remark, the momentary uneasiness they created quickly passed away, and\r\nfor a time was forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, drawing out a keg from beneath a\r\ncover of leaves, toward the close of the repast, and addressing the stranger\r\nwho sat at his elbow, doing great justice to his culinary skill, \xe2\x80\x9ctry a\r\nlittle spruce; \xe2\x80\x99twill wash away all thoughts of the colt, and quicken the\r\nlife in your bosom. I drink to our better friendship, hoping that a little\r\nhorse-flesh may leave no heart-burnings atween us. How do you name\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGamut\xe2\x80\x94David Gamut,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the singing master, preparing\r\nto wash down his sorrows in a powerful draught of the woodsman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh-flavored and well-laced compound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very good name, and, I dare say, handed down from honest forefathers.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m an admirator of names, though the Christian fashions fall far below\r\nsavage customs in this particular. The biggest coward I ever knew was called\r\nLyon; and his wife, Patience, would scold you out of hearing in less time than\r\na hunted deer would run a rod. With an Indian \xe2\x80\x99tis a matter of\r\nconscience; what he calls himself, he generally is\xe2\x80\x94not that Chingachgook,\r\nwhich signifies Big Sarpent, is really a snake, big or little; but that he\r\nunderstands the windings and turnings of human natur\xe2\x80\x99, and is silent, and\r\nstrikes his enemies when they least expect him. What may be your\r\ncalling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an unworthy instructor in the art of psalmody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI teach singing to the youths of the Connecticut levy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might be better employed. The young hounds go laughing and singing\r\ntoo much already through the woods, when they ought not to breathe louder than\r\na fox in his cover. Can you use the smoothbore, or handle the rifle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPraised be God, I have never had occasion to meddle with murderous\r\nimplements!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you understand the compass, and lay down the watercourses and\r\nmountains of the wilderness on paper, in order that they who follow may find\r\nplaces by their given names?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI practice no such employment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a pair of legs that might make a long path seem short! you\r\njourney sometimes, I fancy, with tidings for the general.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever; I follow no other than my own high vocation, which is instruction\r\nin sacred music!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a strange calling!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Hawkeye, with an inward\r\nlaugh, \xe2\x80\x9cto go through life, like a catbird, mocking all the ups and downs\r\nthat may happen to come out of other men\xe2\x80\x99s throats. Well, friend, I\r\nsuppose it is your gift, and mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be denied any more than if\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twas shooting, or some other better inclination. Let us hear what you\r\ncan do in that way; \xe2\x80\x99twill be a friendly manner of saying good-night, for\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis time that these ladies should be getting strength for a hard and a\r\nlong push, in the pride of the morning, afore the Maquas are stirring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith joyful pleasure do I consent\xe2\x80\x9d, said David, adjusting his\r\niron-rimmed spectacles, and producing his beloved little volume, which he\r\nimmediately tendered to Alice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be more fitting and consolatory,\r\nthan to offer up evening praise, after a day of such exceeding jeopardy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice smiled; but, regarding Heyward, she blushed and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndulge yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered; \xe2\x80\x9cought not the suggestion\r\nof the worthy namesake of the Psalmist to have its weight at such a\r\nmoment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his opinion, Alice did what her pious inclinations, and her keen\r\nrelish for gentle sounds, had before so strongly urged. The book was open at a\r\nhymn not ill adapted to their situation, and in which the poet, no longer\r\ngoaded by his desire to excel the inspired King of Israel, had discovered some\r\nchastened and respectable powers. Cora betrayed a disposition to support her\r\nsister, and the sacred song proceeded, after the indispensable preliminaries of\r\nthe pitchpipe, and the tune had been duly attended to by the methodical David.\r\n\r\nThe air was solemn and slow. At times it rose to the fullest compass of the\r\nrich voices of the females, who hung over their little book in holy excitement,\r\nand again it sank so low, that the rushing of the waters ran through their\r\nmelody, like a hollow accompaniment. The natural taste and true ear of David\r\ngoverned and modified the sounds to suit the confined cavern, every crevice and\r\ncranny of which was filled with the thrilling notes of their flexible voices.\r\nThe Indians riveted their eyes on the rocks, and listened with an attention\r\nthat seemed to turn them into stone. But the scout, who had placed his chin in\r\nhis hand, with an expression of cold indifference, gradually suffered his rigid\r\nfeatures to relax, until, as verse succeeded verse, he felt his iron nature\r\nsubdued, while his recollection was carried back to boyhood, when his ears had\r\nbeen accustomed to listen to similar sounds of praise, in the settlements of\r\nthe colony. His roving eyes began to moisten, and before the hymn was ended\r\nscalding tears rolled out of fountains that had long seemed dry, and followed\r\neach other down those cheeks, that had oftener felt the storms of heaven than\r\nany testimonials of weakness. The singers were dwelling on one of those low,\r\ndying chords, which the ear devours with such greedy rapture, as if conscious\r\nthat it is about to lose them, when a cry, that seemed neither human nor\r\nearthly, rose in the outward air, penetrating not only the recesses of the\r\ncavern, but to the inmost hearts of all who heard it. It was followed by a\r\nstillness apparently as deep as if the waters had been checked in their furious\r\nprogress, at such a horrid and unusual interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Alice, after a few moments of terrible\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Alice, after a few\r\nmoments of terrible suspense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Hewyard aloud.\r\n\r\nNeither Hawkeye nor the Indians made any reply. They listened, as if expecting\r\nthe sound would be repeated, with a manner that expressed their own\r\nastonishment. At length they spoke together, earnestly, in the Delaware\r\nlanguage, when Uncas, passing by the inner and most concealed aperture,\r\ncautiously left the cavern. When he had gone, the scout first spoke in English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat it is, or what it is not, none here can tell, though two of us have\r\nranged the woods for more than thirty years. I did believe there was no cry\r\nthat Indian or beast could make, that my ears had not heard; but this has\r\nproved that I was only a vain and conceited mortal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it not, then, the shout the warriors make when they wish to\r\nintimidate their enemies?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cora who stood drawing her veil about\r\nher person, with a calmness to which her agitated sister was a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; this was bad, and shocking, and had a sort of unhuman sound; but\r\nwhen you once hear the war-whoop, you will never mistake it for anything else.\r\nWell, Uncas!\xe2\x80\x9d speaking in Delaware to the young chief as he re-entered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat see you? do our lights shine through the blankets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer was short, and apparently decided, being given in the same tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to be seen without,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hawkeye, shaking\r\nhis head in discontent; \xe2\x80\x9cand our hiding-place is still in darkness. Pass\r\ninto the other cave, you that need it, and seek for sleep; we must be afoot\r\nlong before the sun, and make the most of our time to get to Edward, while the\r\nMingoes are taking their morning nap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCora set the example of compliance, with a steadiness that taught the more\r\ntimid Alice the necessity of obedience. Before leaving the place, however, she\r\nwhispered a request to Duncan, that he would follow. Uncas raised the blanket\r\nfor their passage, and as the sisters turned to thank him for this act of\r\nattention, they saw the scout seated again before the dying embers, with his\r\nface resting on his hands, in a manner which showed how deeply he brooded on\r\nthe unaccountable interruption which had broken up their evening devotions.\r\n\r\nHeyward took with him a blazing knot, which threw a dim light through the\r\nnarrow vista of their new apartment. Placing it in a favorable position, he\r\njoined the females, who now found themselves alone with him for the first time\r\nsince they had left the friendly ramparts of Fort Edward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave us not, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice: \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot sleep in such\r\na place as this, with that horrid cry still ringing in our ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst let us examine into the security of your fortress,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cand then we will speak of rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe approached the further end of the cavern, to an outlet, which, like the\r\nothers, was concealed by blankets; and removing the thick screen, breathed the\r\nfresh and reviving air from the cataract. One arm of the river flowed through a\r\ndeep, narrow ravine, which its current had worn in the soft rock, directly\r\nbeneath his feet, forming an effectual defense, as he believed, against any\r\ndanger from that quarter; the water, a few rods above them, plunging, glancing,\r\nand sweeping along in its most violent and broken manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNature has made an impenetrable barrier on this side,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, pointing down the perpendicular declivity into the dark current\r\nbefore he dropped the blanket; \xe2\x80\x9cand as you know that good men and true\r\nare on guard in front I see no reason why the advice of our honest host should\r\nbe disregarded. I am certain Cora will join me in saying that sleep is\r\nnecessary to you both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCora may submit to the justice of your opinion though she cannot put it\r\nin practice,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the elder sister, who had placed herself by the\r\nside of Alice, on a couch of sassafras; \xe2\x80\x9cthere would be other causes to\r\nchase away sleep, though we had been spared the shock of this mysterious noise.\r\nAsk yourself, Heyward, can daughters forget the anxiety a father must endure,\r\nwhose children lodge he knows not where or how, in such a wilderness, and in\r\nthe midst of so many perils?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a soldier, and knows how to estimate the chances of the\r\nwoods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a father, and cannot deny his nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow kind has he ever been to all my follies, how tender and indulgent to\r\nall my wishes!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Alice. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been selfish, sister, in\r\nurging our visit at such hazard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may have been rash in pressing his consent in a moment of much\r\nembarrassment, but I would have proved to him, that however others might\r\nneglect him in his strait his children at least were faithful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he heard of your arrival at Edward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, kindly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere was a powerful struggle in his bosom between fear and love; though\r\nthe latter, heightened, if possible, by so long a separation, quickly\r\nprevailed. \xe2\x80\x98It is the spirit of my noble-minded Cora that leads them,\r\nDuncan\xe2\x80\x99, he said, \xe2\x80\x98and I will not balk it. Would to God, that he\r\nwho holds the honor of our royal master in his guardianship, would show but\r\nhalf her firmness!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he not speak of me, Heyward?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Alice, with jealous\r\naffection; \xe2\x80\x9csurely, he forgot not altogether his little Elsie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat were impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the young man; \xe2\x80\x9che called\r\nyou by a thousand endearing epithets, that I may not presume to use, but to the\r\njustice of which, I can warmly testify. Once, indeed, he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan ceased speaking; for while his eyes were riveted on those of Alice, who\r\nhad turned toward him with the eagerness of filial affection, to catch his\r\nwords, the same strong, horrid cry, as before, filled the air, and rendered him\r\nmute. A long, breathless silence succeeded, during which each looked at the\r\nothers in fearful expectation of hearing the sound repeated. At length, the\r\nblanket was slowly raised, and the scout stood in the aperture with a\r\ncountenance whose firmness evidently began to give way before a mystery that\r\nseemed to threaten some danger, against which all his cunning and experience\r\nmight prove of no avail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do not sleep,\r\nOn yonder cliffs, a grizzly band,\r\nI see them sit.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Gray\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould be neglecting a warning that is given for our good to lie\r\nhid any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye \xe2\x80\x9cwhen such sounds are raised in the\r\nforest. These gentle ones may keep close, but the Mohicans and I will watch\r\nupon the rock, where I suppose a major of the Sixtieth would wish to keep us\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs, then, our danger so pressing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cora.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe who makes strange sounds, and gives them out for man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninformation, alone knows our danger. I should think myself wicked, unto\r\nrebellion against His will, was I to burrow with such warnings in the air! Even\r\nthe weak soul who passes his days in singing is stirred by the cry, and, as he\r\nsays, is \xe2\x80\x98ready to go forth to the battle\xe2\x80\x99 If \xe2\x80\x99twere only a\r\nbattle, it would be a thing understood by us all, and easily managed; but I\r\nhave heard that when such shrieks are atween heaven and \xe2\x80\x99arth, it\r\nbetokens another sort of warfare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all our reasons for fear, my friend, are confined to such as proceed\r\nfrom supernatural causes, we have but little occasion to be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the undisturbed Cora, \xe2\x80\x9care you certain that our enemies have\r\nnot invented some new and ingenious method to strike us with terror, that their\r\nconquest may become more easy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have listened to all\r\nthe sounds of the woods for thirty years, as a man will listen whose life and\r\ndeath depend on the quickness of his ears. There is no whine of the panther, no\r\nwhistle of the catbird, nor any invention of the devilish Mingoes, that can\r\ncheat me! I have heard the forest moan like mortal men in their affliction;\r\noften, and again, have I listened to the wind playing its music in the branches\r\nof the girdled trees; and I have heard the lightning cracking in the air like\r\nthe snapping of blazing brush as it spitted forth sparks and forked flames; but\r\nnever have I thought that I heard more than the pleasure of him who sported\r\nwith the things of his hand. But neither the Mohicans, nor I, who am a white\r\nman without a cross, can explain the cry just heard. We, therefore, believe it\r\na sign given for our good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, taking his pistols from the\r\nplace where he had laid them on entering; \xe2\x80\x9cbe it a sign of peace or a\r\nsignal of war, it must be looked to. Lead the way, my friend; I follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn issuing from their place of confinement, the whole party instantly\r\nexperienced a grateful renovation of spirits, by exchanging the pent air of the\r\nhiding-place for the cool and invigorating atmosphere which played around the\r\nwhirlpools and pitches of the cataract. A heavy evening breeze swept along the\r\nsurface of the river, and seemed to drive the roar of the falls into the\r\nrecesses of their own cavern, whence it issued heavily and constant, like\r\nthunder rumbling beyond the distant hills. The moon had risen, and its light\r\nwas already glancing here and there on the waters above them; but the extremity\r\nof the rock where they stood still lay in shadow. With the exception of the\r\nsounds produced by the rushing waters, and an occasional breathing of the air,\r\nas it murmured past them in fitful currents, the scene was as still as night\r\nand solitude could make it. In vain were the eyes of each individual bent along\r\nthe opposite shores, in quest of some signs of life, that might explain the\r\nnature of the interruption they had heard. Their anxious and eager looks were\r\nbaffled by the deceptive light, or rested only on naked rocks, and straight and\r\nimmovable trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is nothing to be seen but the gloom and quiet of a lovely\r\nevening,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9chow much should we prize such a scene,\r\nand all this breathing solitude, at any other moment, Cora! Fancy yourselves in\r\nsecurity, and what now, perhaps, increases your terror, may be made conducive\r\nto enjoyment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Alice.\r\n\r\nThe caution was unnecessary. Once more the same sound arose, as if from the bed\r\nof the river, and having broken out of the narrow bounds of the cliffs, was\r\nheard undulating through the forest, in distant and dying cadences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan any here give a name to such a cry?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Hawkeye, when\r\nthe last echo was lost in the woods; \xe2\x80\x9cif so, let him speak; for myself, I\r\njudge it not to belong to \xe2\x80\x99arth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, then, is one who can undeceive you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow the sound full well, for often have I heard it on the field of battle, and\r\nin situations which are frequent in a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s life. \xe2\x80\x99Tis the\r\nhorrid shriek that a horse will give in his agony; oftener drawn from him in\r\npain, though sometimes in terror. My charger is either a prey to the beasts of\r\nthe forest, or he sees his danger, without the power to avoid it. The sound\r\nmight deceive me in the cavern, but in the open air I know it too well to be\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout and his companions listened to this simple explanation with the\r\ninterest of men who imbibe new ideas, at the same time that they get rid of old\r\nones, which had proved disagreeable inmates. The two latter uttered their usual\r\nexpressive exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9chugh!\xe2\x80\x9d as the truth first glanced upon\r\ntheir minds, while the former, after a short, musing pause, took upon himself\r\nto reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot deny your words,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am little skilled\r\nin horses, though born where they abound. The wolves must be hovering above\r\ntheir heads on the bank, and the timorsome creatures are calling on man for\r\nhelp, in the best manner they are able. Uncas\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he spoke in\r\nDelaware\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cUncas, drop down in the canoe, and whirl a brand among\r\nthe pack; or fear may do what the wolves can\xe2\x80\x99t get at to perform, and\r\nleave us without horses in the morning, when we shall have so much need to\r\njourney swiftly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young native had already descended to the water to comply, when a long howl\r\nwas raised on the edge of the river, and was borne swiftly off into the depths\r\nof the forest, as though the beasts, of their own accord, were abandoning their\r\nprey in sudden terror. Uncas, with instinctive quickness, receded, and the\r\nthree foresters held another of their low, earnest conferences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been like hunters who have lost the points of the heavens, and\r\nfrom whom the sun has been hid for days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, turning away from\r\nhis companions; \xe2\x80\x9cnow we begin again to know the signs of our course, and\r\nthe paths are cleared from briers! Seat yourselves in the shade which the moon\r\nthrows from yonder beech\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis thicker than that of the\r\npines\xe2\x80\x94and let us wait for that which the Lord may choose to send next.\r\nLet all your conversation be in whispers; though it would be better, and,\r\nperhaps, in the end, wiser, if each one held discourse with his own thoughts,\r\nfor a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manner of the scout was seriously impressive, though no longer\r\ndistinguished by any signs of unmanly apprehension. It was evident that his\r\nmomentary weakness had vanished with the explanation of a mystery which his own\r\nexperience had not served to fathom; and though he now felt all the realities\r\nof their actual condition, that he was prepared to meet them with the energy of\r\nhis hardy nature. This feeling seemed also common to the natives, who placed\r\nthemselves in positions which commanded a full view of both shores, while their\r\nown persons were effectually concealed from observation. In such circumstances,\r\ncommon prudence dictated that Heyward and his companions should imitate a\r\ncaution that proceeded from so intelligent a source. The young man drew a pile\r\nof the sassafras from the cave, and placing it in the chasm which separated the\r\ntwo caverns, it was occupied by the sisters, who were thus protected by the\r\nrocks from any missiles, while their anxiety was relieved by the assurance that\r\nno danger could approach without a warning. Heyward himself was posted at hand,\r\nso near that he might communicate with his companions without raising his voice\r\nto a dangerous elevation; while David, in imitation of the woodsmen, bestowed\r\nhis person in such a manner among the fissures of the rocks, that his ungainly\r\nlimbs were no longer offensive to the eye.\r\n\r\nIn this manner hours passed without further interruption. The moon reached the\r\nzenith, and shed its mild light perpendicularly on the lovely sight of the\r\nsisters slumbering peacefully in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms. Duncan cast the wide\r\nshawl of Cora before a spectacle he so much loved to contemplate, and then\r\nsuffered his own head to seek a pillow on the rock. David began to utter sounds\r\nthat would have shocked his delicate organs in more wakeful moments; in short,\r\nall but Hawkeye and the Mohicans lost every idea of consciousness, in\r\nuncontrollable drowsiness. But the watchfulness of these vigilant protectors\r\nneither tired nor slumbered. Immovable as that rock, of which each appeared to\r\nform a part, they lay, with their eyes roving, without intermission, along the\r\ndark margin of trees, that bounded the adjacent shores of the narrow stream.\r\nNot a sound escaped them; the most subtle examination could not have told they\r\nbreathed. It was evident that this excess of caution proceeded from an\r\nexperience that no subtlety on the part of their enemies could deceive. It was,\r\nhowever, continued without any apparent consequences, until the moon had set,\r\nand a pale streak above the treetops, at the bend of the river a little below,\r\nannounced the approach of day.\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time, Hawkeye was seen to stir. He crawled along the rock\r\nand shook Duncan from his heavy slumbers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow is the time to journey,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered; \xe2\x80\x9cawake the gentle\r\nones, and be ready to get into the canoe when I bring it to the\r\nlanding-place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had a quiet night?\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cfor myself, I\r\nbelieve sleep has got the better of my vigilance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is yet still as midnight. Be silent, but be quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time Duncan was thoroughly awake, and he immediately lifted the shawl\r\nfrom the sleeping females. The motion caused Cora to raise her hand as if to\r\nrepulse him, while Alice murmured, in her soft, gentle voice, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\r\ndear father, we were not deserted; Duncan was with us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sweet innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the youth; \xe2\x80\x9cDuncan is here,\r\nand while life continues or danger remains, he will never quit thee. Cora!\r\nAlice! awake! The hour has come to move!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA loud shriek from the younger of the sisters, and the form of the other\r\nstanding upright before him, in bewildered horror, was the unexpected answer he\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nWhile the words were still on the lips of Heyward, there had arisen such a\r\ntumult of yells and cries as served to drive the swift currents of his own\r\nblood back from its bounding course into the fountains of his heart. It seemed,\r\nfor near a minute, as if the demons of hell had possessed themselves of the air\r\nabout them, and were venting their savage humors in barbarous sounds. The cries\r\ncame from no particular direction, though it was evident they filled the woods,\r\nand, as the appalled listeners easily imagined, the caverns of the falls, the\r\nrocks, the bed of the river, and the upper air. David raised his tall person in\r\nthe midst of the infernal din, with a hand on either ear, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhence comes this discord! Has hell broke loose, that man should utter\r\nsounds like these!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bright flashes and the quick reports of a dozen rifles, from the opposite\r\nbanks of the stream, followed this incautious exposure of his person, and left\r\nthe unfortunate singing master senseless on that rock where he had been so long\r\nslumbering. The Mohicans boldly sent back the intimidating yell of their\r\nenemies, who raised a shout of savage triumph at the fall of Gamut. The flash\r\nof rifles was then quick and close between them, but either party was too well\r\nskilled to leave even a limb exposed to the hostile aim. Duncan listened with\r\nintense anxiety for the strokes of the paddle, believing that flight was now\r\ntheir only refuge. The river glanced by with its ordinary velocity, but the\r\ncanoe was nowhere to be seen on its dark waters. He had just fancied they were\r\ncruelly deserted by their scout, as a stream of flame issued from the rock\r\nbeneath them, and a fierce yell, blended with a shriek of agony, announced that\r\nthe messenger of death sent from the fatal weapon of Hawkeye, had found a\r\nvictim. At this slight repulse the assailants instantly withdrew, and gradually\r\nthe place became as still as before the sudden tumult.\r\n\r\nDuncan seized the favorable moment to spring to the body of Gamut, which he\r\nbore within the shelter of the narrow chasm that protected the sisters. In\r\nanother minute the whole party was collected in this spot of comparative\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor fellow has saved his scalp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, coolly passing\r\nhis hand over the head of David; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he is a proof that a man may be\r\nborn with too long a tongue! \xe2\x80\x99Twas downright madness to show six feet of\r\nflesh and blood, on a naked rock, to the raging savages. I only wonder he has\r\nescaped with life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he not dead?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Cora, in a voice whose husky tones\r\nshowed how powerfully natural horror struggled with her assumed firmness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we do aught to assist the wretched man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! the life is in his heart yet, and after he has slept awhile he\r\nwill come to himself, and be a wiser man for it, till the hour of his real time\r\nshall come,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hawkeye, casting another oblique glance at the\r\ninsensible body, while he filled his charger with admirable nicety.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry him in, Uncas, and lay him on the sassafras. The longer his nap\r\nlasts the better it will be for him, as I doubt whether he can find a proper\r\ncover for such a shape on these rocks; and singing won\xe2\x80\x99t do any good with\r\nthe Iroquois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe, then, the attack will be renewed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I expect a hungry wolf will satisfy his craving with a mouthful! They\r\nhave lost a man, and \xe2\x80\x99tis their fashion, when they meet a loss, and fail\r\nin the surprise, to fall back; but we shall have them on again, with new\r\nexpedients to circumvent us, and master our scalps. Our main hope,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, raising his rugged countenance, across which a shade of anxiety just\r\nthen passed like a darkening cloud, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be to keep the rock until Munro\r\ncan send a party to our help! God send it may be soon and under a leader that\r\nknows the Indian customs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear our probable fortunes, Cora,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nknow we have everything to hope from the anxiety and experience of your father.\r\nCome, then, with Alice, into this cavern, where you, at least, will be safe\r\nfrom the murderous rifles of our enemies, and where you may bestow a care\r\nsuited to your gentle natures on our unfortunate comrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sisters followed him into the outer cave, where David was beginning, by his\r\nsighs, to give symptoms of returning consciousness, and then commending the\r\nwounded man to their attention, he immediately prepared to leave them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuncan!\xe2\x80\x9d said the tremulous voice of Cora, when he had reached the\r\nmouth of the cavern. He turned and beheld the speaker, whose color had changed\r\nto a deadly paleness, and whose lips quivered, gazing after him, with an\r\nexpression of interest which immediately recalled him to her side.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, Duncan, how necessary your safety is to our own\xe2\x80\x94how you\r\nbear a father\xe2\x80\x99s sacred trust\xe2\x80\x94how much depends on your discretion\r\nand care\xe2\x80\x94in short,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, while the telltale blood stole over\r\nher features, crimsoning her very temples, \xe2\x80\x9chow very deservedly dear you\r\nare to all of the name of Munro.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anything could add to my own base love of life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward,\r\nsuffering his unconscious eyes to wander to the youthful form of the silent\r\nAlice, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be so kind an assurance. As major of the Sixtieth, our\r\nhonest host will tell you I must take my share of the fray; but our task will\r\nbe easy; it is merely to keep these blood-hounds at bay for a few hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, he tore himself from the presence of the sisters,\r\nand joined the scout and his companions, who still lay within the protection of\r\nthe little chasm between the two caves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Uncas,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former, as Heyward joined them,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are wasteful of your powder, and the kick of the rifle disconcerts\r\nyour aim! Little powder, light lead, and a long arm, seldom fail of bringing\r\nthe death screech from a Mingo! At least, such has been my experience with the\r\ncreatur\xe2\x80\x99s. Come, friends: let us to our covers, for no man can tell when\r\nor where a Maqua[1]\r\nwill strike his blow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nMingo was the Delaware term of the Five Nations. Maquas was the name given\r\nthem by the Dutch. The French, from their first intercourse with them, called\r\nthem Iroquois.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians silently repaired to their appointed stations, which were fissures\r\nin the rocks, whence they could command the approaches to the foot of the\r\nfalls. In the center of the little island, a few short and stunted pines had\r\nfound root, forming a thicket, into which Hawkeye darted with the swiftness of\r\na deer, followed by the active Duncan. Here they secured themselves, as well as\r\ncircumstances would permit, among the shrubs and fragments of stone that were\r\nscattered about the place. Above them was a bare, rounded rock, on each side of\r\nwhich the water played its gambols, and plunged into the abysses beneath, in\r\nthe manner already described. As the day had now dawned, the opposite shores no\r\nlonger presented a confused outline, but they were able to look into the woods,\r\nand distinguish objects beneath a canopy of gloomy pines.\r\n\r\nA long and anxious watch succeeded, but without any further evidences of a\r\nrenewed attack; and Duncan began to hope that their fire had proved more fatal\r\nthan was supposed, and that their enemies had been effectually repulsed. When\r\nhe ventured to utter this impression to his companions, it was met by Hawkeye\r\nwith an incredulous shake of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know not the nature of a Maqua, if you think he is so easily beaten\r\nback without a scalp!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there was one of the imps\r\nyelling this morning, there were forty! and they know our number and quality\r\ntoo well to give up the chase so soon. Hist! look into the water above, just\r\nwhere it breaks over the rocks. I am no mortal, if the risky devils\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t swam down upon the very pitch, and, as bad luck would have it,\r\nthey have hit the head of the island. Hist! man, keep close! or the hair will\r\nbe off your crown in the turning of a knife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward lifted his head from the cover, and beheld what he justly considered a\r\nprodigy of rashness and skill. The river had worn away the edge of the soft\r\nrock in such a manner as to render its first pitch less abrupt and\r\nperpendicular than is usual at waterfalls. With no other guide than the ripple\r\nof the stream where it met the head of the island, a party of their insatiable\r\nfoes had ventured into the current, and swam down upon this point, knowing the\r\nready access it would give, if successful, to their intended victims.\r\n\r\nAs Hawkeye ceased speaking, four human heads could be seen peering above a few\r\nlogs of drift-wood that had lodged on these naked rocks, and which had probably\r\nsuggested the idea of the practicability of the hazardous undertaking. At the\r\nnext moment, a fifth form was seen floating over the green edge of the fall, a\r\nlittle from the line of the island. The savage struggled powerfully to gain the\r\npoint of safety, and, favored by the glancing water, he was already stretching\r\nforth an arm to meet the grasp of his companions, when he shot away again with\r\nthe shirling current, appeared to rise into the air, with uplifted arms and\r\nstarting eyeballs, and fell, with a sudden plunge, into that deep and yawning\r\nabyss over which he hovered. A single, wild, despairing shriek rose from the\r\ncavern, and all was hushed again as the grave.\r\n\r\nThe first generous impulse of Duncan was to rush to the rescue of the hapless\r\nwretch; but he felt himself bound to the spot by the iron grasp of the\r\nimmovable scout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould ye bring certain death upon us, by telling the Mingoes where we\r\nlie?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Hawkeye, sternly; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a charge of powder\r\nsaved, and ammunition is as precious now as breath to a worried deer! Freshen\r\nthe priming of your pistols\xe2\x80\x94the midst of the falls is apt to dampen the\r\nbrimstone\xe2\x80\x94and stand firm for a close struggle, while I fire on their\r\nrush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed a finger in his mouth, and drew a long, shrill whistle, which was\r\nanswered from the rocks that were guarded by the Mohicans. Duncan caught\r\nglimpses of heads above the scattered drift-wood, as this signal rose on the\r\nair, but they disappeared again as suddenly as they had glanced upon his sight.\r\nA low, rustling sound next drew his attention behind him, and turning his head,\r\nhe beheld Uncas within a few feet, creeping to his side. Hawkeye spoke to him\r\nin Delaware, when the young chief took his position with singular caution and\r\nundisturbed coolness. To Heyward this was a moment of feverish and impatient\r\nsuspense; though the scout saw fit to select it as a fit occasion to read a\r\nlecture to his more youthful associates on the art of using firearms with\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf all we\xe2\x80\x99pons,\xe2\x80\x9d he commenced, \xe2\x80\x9cthe long barreled,\r\ntrue-grooved, soft-metaled rifle is the most dangerous in skillful hands,\r\nthough it wants a strong arm, a quick eye, and great judgment in charging, to\r\nput forth all its beauties. The gunsmiths can have but little insight into\r\ntheir trade when they make their fowling-pieces and short\r\nhorsemen\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by the low but expressive \xe2\x80\x9chugh\xe2\x80\x9d of Uncas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see them, boy, I see them!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hawkeye; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are\r\ngathering for the rush, or they would keep their dingy backs below the logs.\r\nWell, let them,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, examining his flint; \xe2\x80\x9cthe leading man\r\ncertainly comes on to his death, though it should be Montcalm himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment the woods were filled with another burst of cries, and at the\r\nsignal four savages sprang from the cover of the driftwood. Heyward felt a\r\nburning desire to rush forward to meet them, so intense was the delirious\r\nanxiety of the moment; but he was restrained by the deliberate examples of the\r\nscout and Uncas.\r\n\r\nWhen their foes, who had leaped over the black rocks that divided them, with\r\nlong bounds, uttering the wildest yells, were within a few rods, the rifle of\r\nHawkeye slowly rose among the shrubs, and poured out its fatal contents. The\r\nforemost Indian bounded like a stricken deer, and fell headlong among the\r\nclefts of the island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Uncas!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the scout, drawing his long knife, while his\r\nquick eyes began to flash with ardor, \xe2\x80\x9ctake the last of the screeching\r\nimps; of the other two we are sartain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was obeyed; and but two enemies remained to be overcome. Heyward had given\r\none of his pistols to Hawkeye, and together they rushed down a little declivity\r\ntoward their foes; they discharged their weapons at the same instant, and\r\nequally without success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x99d it! and I said it!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the scout, whirling\r\nthe despised little implement over the falls with bitter disdain. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\non, ye bloody minded hell-hounds! ye meet a man without a cross!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were barely uttered, when he encountered a savage of gigantic\r\nstature, of the fiercest mien. At the same moment, Duncan found himself engaged\r\nwith the other, in a similar contest of hand to hand. With ready skill, Hawkeye\r\nand his antagonist each grasped that uplifted arm of the other which held the\r\ndangerous knife. For near a minute they stood looking one another in the eye,\r\nand gradually exerting the power of their muscles for the mastery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt length, the toughened sinews of the white man prevailed over the less\r\npracticed limbs of the native. The arm of the latter slowly gave way before the\r\nincreasing force of the scout, who, suddenly wresting his armed hand from the\r\ngrasp of the foe, drove the sharp weapon through his naked bosom to the heart.\r\nIn the meantime, Heyward had been pressed in a more deadly struggle. His slight\r\nsword was snapped in the first encounter. As he was destitute of any other\r\nmeans of defense, his safety now depended entirely on bodily strength and\r\nresolution. Though deficient in neither of these qualities, he had met an enemy\r\nevery way his equal. Happily, he soon succeeded in disarming his adversary,\r\nwhose knife fell on the rock at their feet; and from this moment it became a\r\nfierce struggle who should cast the other over the dizzy height into a\r\nneighboring cavern of the falls. Every successive struggle brought them nearer\r\nto the verge, where Duncan perceived the final and conquering effort must be\r\nmade. Each of the combatants threw all his energies into that effort, and the\r\nresult was, that both tottered on the brink of the precipice. Heyward felt the\r\ngrasp of the other at his throat, and saw the grim smile the savage gave, under\r\nthe revengeful hope that he hurried his enemy to a fate similar to his own, as\r\nhe felt his body slowly yielding to a resistless power, and the young man\r\nexperienced the passing agony of such a moment in all its horrors. At that\r\ninstant of extreme danger, a dark hand and glancing knife appeared before him;\r\nthe Indian released his hold, as the blood flowed freely from around the\r\nsevered tendons of the wrist; and while Duncan was drawn backward by the saving\r\nhand of Uncas, his charmed eyes still were riveted on the fierce and\r\ndisappointed countenance of his foe, who fell sullenly and disappointed down\r\nthe irrecoverable precipice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo cover! to cover!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hawkeye, who just then had despatched\r\nthe enemy; \xe2\x80\x9cto cover, for your lives! the work is but half ended!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Mohican gave a shout of triumph, and followed by Duncan, he glided up\r\nthe acclivity they had descended to the combat, and sought the friendly shelter\r\nof the rocks and shrubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey linger yet,\r\nAvengers of their native land.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Gray\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warning call of the scout was not uttered without occasion. During the\r\noccurrence of the deadly encounter just related, the roar of the falls was\r\nunbroken by any human sound whatever. It would seem that interest in the result\r\nhad kept the natives on the opposite shores in breathless suspense, while the\r\nquick evolutions and swift changes in the positions of the combatants\r\neffectually prevented a fire that might prove dangerous alike to friend and\r\nenemy. But the moment the struggle was decided, a yell arose as fierce and\r\nsavage as wild and revengeful passions could throw into the air. It was\r\nfollowed by the swift flashes of the rifles, which sent their leaden messengers\r\nacross the rock in volleys, as though the assailants would pour out their\r\nimpotent fury on the insensible scene of the fatal contest.\r\n\r\nA steady, though deliberate return was made from the rifle of Chingachgook, who\r\nhad maintained his post throughout the fray with unmoved resolution. When the\r\ntriumphant shout of Uncas was borne to his ears, the gratified father raised\r\nhis voice in a single responsive cry, after which his busy piece alone proved\r\nthat he still guarded his pass with unwearied diligence. In this manner many\r\nminutes flew by with the swiftness of thought; the rifles of the assailants\r\nspeaking, at times, in rattling volleys, and at others in occasional,\r\nscattering shots. Though the rock, the trees, and the shrubs, were cut and torn\r\nin a hundred places around the besieged, their cover was so close, and so\r\nrigidly maintained, that, as yet, David had been the only sufferer in their\r\nlittle band.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them burn their powder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the deliberate scout, while\r\nbullet after bullet whizzed by the place where he securely lay; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nwill be a fine gathering of lead when it is over, and I fancy the imps will\r\ntire of the sport afore these old stones cry out for mercy! Uncas, boy, you\r\nwaste the kernels by overcharging; and a kicking rifle never carries a true\r\nbullet. I told you to take that loping miscreant under the line of white point;\r\nnow, if your bullet went a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth it went two inches above it.\r\nThe life lies low in a Mingo, and humanity teaches us to make a quick end to\r\nthe sarpents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA quiet smile lighted the haughty features of the young Mohican, betraying his\r\nknowledge of the English language as well as of the other\xe2\x80\x99s meaning; but\r\nhe suffered it to pass away without vindication of reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot permit you to accuse Uncas of want of judgment or of\r\nskill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9che saved my life in the coolest and readiest\r\nmanner, and he has made a friend who never will require to be reminded of the\r\ndebt he owes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas partly raised his body, and offered his hand to the grasp of Heyward.\r\nDuring this act of friendship, the two young men exchanged looks of\r\nintelligence which caused Duncan to forget the character and condition of his\r\nwild associate. In the meanwhile, Hawkeye, who looked on this burst of youthful\r\nfeeling with a cool but kind regard made the following reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife is an obligation which friends often owe each other in the\r\nwilderness. I dare say I may have served Uncas some such turn myself before\r\nnow; and I very well remember that he has stood between me and death five\r\ndifferent times; three times from the Mingoes, once in crossing Horican,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat bullet was better aimed than common!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Duncan,\r\ninvoluntarily shrinking from a shot which struck the rock at his side with a\r\nsmart rebound.\r\n\r\nHawkeye laid his hand on the shapeless metal, and shook his head, as he\r\nexamined it, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cFalling lead is never flattened, had it come from\r\nthe clouds this might have happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the rifle of Uncas was deliberately raised toward the heavens, directing\r\nthe eyes of his companions to a point, where the mystery was immediately\r\nexplained. A ragged oak grew on the right bank of the river, nearly opposite to\r\ntheir position, which, seeking the freedom of the open space, had inclined so\r\nfar forward that its upper branches overhung that arm of the stream which\r\nflowed nearest to its own shore. Among the topmost leaves, which scantily\r\nconcealed the gnarled and stunted limbs, a savage was nestled, partly concealed\r\nby the trunk of the tree, and partly exposed, as though looking down upon them\r\nto ascertain the effect produced by his treacherous aim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese devils will scale heaven to circumvent us to our ruin,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHawkeye; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep him in play, boy, until I can bring \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto bear, when we will try his metal on each side of the tree at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas delayed his fire until the scout uttered the word.\r\n\r\nThe rifles flashed, the leaves and bark of the oak flew into the air, and were\r\nscattered by the wind, but the Indian answered their assault by a taunting\r\nlaugh, sending down upon them another bullet in return, that struck the cap of\r\nHawkeye from his head. Once more the savage yells burst out of the woods, and\r\nthe leaden hail whistled above the heads of the besieged, as if to confine them\r\nto a place where they might become easy victims to the enterprise of the\r\nwarrior who had mounted the tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis must be looked to,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, glancing about him with\r\nan anxious eye. \xe2\x80\x9cUncas, call up your father; we have need of all our\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99pons to bring the cunning varmint from his roost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe signal was instantly given; and, before Hawkeye had reloaded his rifle,\r\nthey were joined by Chingachgook. When his son pointed out to the experienced\r\nwarrior the situation of their dangerous enemy, the usual exclamatory\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chugh\xe2\x80\x9d burst from his lips; after which, no further expression of\r\nsurprise or alarm was suffered to escape him. Hawkeye and the Mohicans\r\nconversed earnestly together in Delaware for a few moments, when each quietly\r\ntook his post, in order to execute the plan they had speedily devised.\r\n\r\nThe warrior in the oak had maintained a quick, though ineffectual fire, from\r\nthe moment of his discovery. But his aim was interrupted by the vigilance of\r\nhis enemies, whose rifles instantaneously bore on any part of his person that\r\nwas left exposed. Still his bullets fell in the center of the crouching party.\r\nThe clothes of Heyward, which rendered him peculiarly conspicuous, were\r\nrepeatedly cut, and once blood was drawn from a slight wound in his arm.\r\n\r\nAt length, emboldened by the long and patient watchfulness of his enemies, the\r\nHuron attempted a better and more fatal aim. The quick eyes of the Mohicans\r\ncaught the dark line of his lower limbs incautiously exposed through the thin\r\nfoliage, a few inches from the trunk of the tree. Their rifles made a common\r\nreport, when, sinking on his wounded limb, part of the body of the savage came\r\ninto view. Swift as thought, Hawkeye seized the advantage, and discharged his\r\nfatal weapon into the top of the oak. The leaves were unusually agitated; the\r\ndangerous rifle fell from its commanding elevation, and after a few moments of\r\nvain struggling, the form of the savage was seen swinging in the wind, while he\r\nstill grasped a ragged and naked branch of the tree with hands clenched in\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him, in pity, give him the contents of another rifle,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nDuncan, turning away his eyes in horror from the spectacle of a fellow creature\r\nin such awful jeopardy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a karnel!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the obdurate Hawkeye; \xe2\x80\x9chis death is\r\ncertain, and we have no powder to spare, for Indian fights sometimes last for\r\ndays; \xe2\x80\x99tis their scalps or ours! and God, who made us, has put into our\r\nnatures the craving to keep the skin on the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgainst this stern and unyielding morality, supported as it was by such visible\r\npolicy, there was no appeal. From that moment the yells in the forest once more\r\nceased, the fire was suffered to decline, and all eyes, those of friends as\r\nwell as enemies, became fixed on the hopeless condition of the wretch who was\r\ndangling between heaven and earth. The body yielded to the currents of air, and\r\nthough no murmur or groan escaped the victim, there were instants when he\r\ngrimly faced his foes, and the anguish of cold despair might be traced, through\r\nthe intervening distance, in possession of his swarthy lineaments. Three\r\nseveral times the scout raised his piece in mercy, and as often, prudence\r\ngetting the better of his intention, it was again silently lowered. At length\r\none hand of the Huron lost its hold, and dropped exhausted to his side. A\r\ndesperate and fruitless struggle to recover the branch succeeded, and then the\r\nsavage was seen for a fleeting instant, grasping wildly at the empty air. The\r\nlightning is not quicker than was the flame from the rifle of Hawkeye; the\r\nlimbs of the victim trembled and contracted, the head fell to the bosom, and\r\nthe body parted the foaming waters like lead, when the element closed above it,\r\nin its ceaseless velocity, and every vestige of the unhappy Huron was lost\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nNo shout of triumph succeeded this important advantage, but even the Mohicans\r\ngazed at each other in silent horror. A single yell burst from the woods, and\r\nall was again still. Hawkeye, who alone appeared to reason on the occasion,\r\nshook his head at his own momentary weakness, even uttering his\r\nself-disapprobation aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas the last charge in my horn and the last bullet in my pouch,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x99twas the act of a boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat mattered it\r\nwhether he struck the rock living or dead! feeling would soon be over. Uncas,\r\nlad, go down to the canoe, and bring up the big horn; it is all the powder we\r\nhave left, and we shall need it to the last grain, or I am ignorant of the\r\nMingo nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Mohican complied, leaving the scout turning over the useless contents\r\nof his pouch, and shaking the empty horn with renewed discontent. From this\r\nunsatisfactory examination, however, he was soon called by a loud and piercing\r\nexclamation from Uncas, that sounded, even to the unpracticed ears of Duncan,\r\nas the signal of some new and unexpected calamity. Every thought filled with\r\napprehension for the previous treasure he had concealed in the cavern, the\r\nyoung man started to his feet, totally regardless of the hazard he incurred by\r\nsuch an exposure. As if actuated by a common impulse, his movement was imitated\r\nby his companions, and, together they rushed down the pass to the friendly\r\nchasm, with a rapidity that rendered the scattering fire of their enemies\r\nperfectly harmless. The unwonted cry had brought the sisters, together with the\r\nwounded David, from their place of refuge; and the whole party, at a single\r\nglance, was made acquainted with the nature of the disaster that had disturbed\r\neven the practiced stoicism of their youthful Indian protector.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the rock, their little bark was to be seen floating\r\nacross the eddy, toward the swift current of the river, in a manner which\r\nproved that its course was directed by some hidden agent. The instant this\r\nunwelcome sight caught the eye of the scout, his rifle was leveled as by\r\ninstinct, but the barrel gave no answer to the bright sparks of the flint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis too late, \xe2\x80\x99tis too late!\xe2\x80\x9d Hawkeye exclaimed,\r\ndropping the useless piece in bitter disappointment; \xe2\x80\x9cthe miscreant has\r\nstruck the rapid; and had we powder, it could hardly send the lead swifter than\r\nhe now goes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe adventurous Huron raised his head above the shelter of the canoe, and,\r\nwhile it glided swiftly down the stream, he waved his hand, and gave forth the\r\nshout, which was the known signal of success. His cry was answered by a yell\r\nand a laugh from the woods, as tauntingly exulting as if fifty demons were\r\nuttering their blasphemies at the fall of some Christian soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell may you laugh, ye children of the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout,\r\nseating himself on a projection of the rock, and suffering his gun to fall\r\nneglected at his feet, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the three quickest and truest rifles in these\r\nwoods are no better than so many stalks of mullein, or the last year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorns of a buck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Duncan, losing the first feeling of\r\ndisappointment in a more manly desire for exertion; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will become of\r\nus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye made no other reply than by passing his finger around the crown of his\r\nhead, in a manner so significant, that none who witnessed the action could\r\nmistake its meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, surely, our case is not so desperate!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nyouth; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Hurons are not here; we may make good the caverns, we may\r\noppose their landing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what?\xe2\x80\x9d coolly demanded the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cThe arrows of Uncas,\r\nor such tears as women shed! No, no; you are young, and rich, and have friends,\r\nand at such an age I know it is hard to die! But,\xe2\x80\x9d glancing his eyes at\r\nthe Mohicans, \xe2\x80\x9clet us remember we are men without a cross, and let us\r\nteach these natives of the forest that white blood can run as freely as red,\r\nwhen the appointed hour is come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan turned quickly in the direction indicated by the other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and\r\nread a confirmation of his worst apprehensions in the conduct of the Indians.\r\nChingachgook, placing himself in a dignified posture on another fragment of the\r\nrock, had already laid aside his knife and tomahawk, and was in the act of\r\ntaking the eagle\xe2\x80\x99s plume from his head, and smoothing the solitary tuft\r\nof hair in readiness to perform its last and revolting office. His countenance\r\nwas composed, though thoughtful, while his dark, gleaming eyes were gradually\r\nlosing the fierceness of the combat in an expression better suited to the\r\nchange he expected momentarily to undergo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur case is not, cannot be so hopeless!\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9ceven\r\nat this very moment succor may be at hand. I see no enemies! They have sickened\r\nof a struggle in which they risk so much with so little prospect of\r\ngain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a minute, or it may be an hour, afore the wily sarpents steal\r\nupon us, and it is quite in natur\xe2\x80\x99 for them to be lying within hearing at\r\nthis very moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye; \xe2\x80\x9cbut come they will, and in such a\r\nfashion as will leave us nothing to hope! Chingachgook\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he spoke in\r\nDelaware\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy brother, we have fought our last battle together, and\r\nthe Maquas will triumph in the death of the sage man of the Mohicans, and of\r\nthe pale face, whose eyes can make night as day, and level the clouds to the\r\nmists of the springs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the Mingo women go weep over the slain!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Indian,\r\nwith characteristic pride and unmoved firmness; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Great Snake of the\r\nMohicans has coiled himself in their wigwams, and has poisoned their triumph\r\nwith the wailings of children, whose fathers have not returned! Eleven warriors\r\nlie hid from the graves of their tribes since the snows have melted, and none\r\nwill tell where to find them when the tongue of Chingachgook shall be silent!\r\nLet them draw the sharpest knife, and whirl the swiftest tomahawk, for their\r\nbitterest enemy is in their hands. Uncas, topmost branch of a noble trunk, call\r\non the cowards to hasten, or their hearts will soften, and they will change to\r\nwomen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look among the fishes for their dead!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the low, soft\r\nvoice of the youthful chieftain; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Hurons float with the slimy eels!\r\nThey drop from the oaks like fruit that is ready to be eaten! and the Delawares\r\nlaugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the scout, who had listened to this peculiar\r\nburst of the natives with deep attention; \xe2\x80\x9cthey have warmed their Indian\r\nfeelings, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll soon provoke the Maquas to give them a speedy end.\r\nAs for me, who am of the whole blood of the whites, it is befitting that I\r\nshould die as becomes my color, with no words of scoffing in my mouth, and\r\nwithout bitterness at the heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy die at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora, advancing from the place where natural\r\nhorror had, until this moment, held her riveted to the rock; \xe2\x80\x9cthe path is\r\nopen on every side; fly, then, to the woods, and call on God for succor. Go,\r\nbrave men, we owe you too much already; let us no longer involve you in our\r\nhapless fortunes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou but little know the craft of the Iroquois, lady, if you judge they\r\nhave left the path open to the woods!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hawkeye, who, however,\r\nimmediately added in his simplicity, \xe2\x80\x9cthe down stream current, it is\r\ncertain, might soon sweep us beyond the reach of their rifles or the sound of\r\ntheir voices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen try the river. Why linger to add to the number of the victims of\r\nour merciless enemies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the scout, looking about him proudly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause it is better for a man to die at peace with himself than to live\r\nhaunted by an evil conscience! What answer could we give Munro, when he asked\r\nus where and how we left his children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to him, and say that you left them with a message to hasten to their\r\naid,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cora, advancing nigher to the scout in her generous ardor;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the Hurons bear them into the northern wilds, but that by vigilance\r\nand speed they may yet be rescued; and if, after all, it should please heaven\r\nthat his assistance come too late, bear to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, her voice\r\ngradually lowering, until it seemed nearly choked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe love, the\r\nblessings, the final prayers of his daughters, and bid him not mourn their\r\nearly fate, but to look forward with humble confidence to the Christian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoal to meet his children.\xe2\x80\x9d The hard, weather-beaten features of the\r\nscout began to work, and when she had ended, he dropped his chin to his hand,\r\nlike a man musing profoundly on the nature of the proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is reason in her words!\xe2\x80\x9d at length broke from his compressed\r\nand trembling lips; \xe2\x80\x9cay, and they bear the spirit of Christianity; what\r\nmight be right and proper in a red-skin, may be sinful in a man who has not\r\neven a cross in blood to plead for his ignorance. Chingachgook! Uncas! hear you\r\nthe talk of the dark-eyed woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe now spoke in Delaware to his companions, and his address, though calm and\r\ndeliberate, seemed very decided. The elder Mohican heard with deep gravity, and\r\nappeared to ponder on his words, as though he felt the importance of their\r\nimport. After a moment of hesitation, he waved his hand in assent, and uttered\r\nthe English word \xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d with the peculiar emphasis of his people.\r\nThen, replacing his knife and tomahawk in his girdle, the warrior moved\r\nsilently to the edge of the rock which was most concealed from the banks of the\r\nriver. Here he paused a moment, pointed significantly to the woods below, and\r\nsaying a few words in his own language, as if indicating his intended route, he\r\ndropped into the water, and sank from before the eyes of the witnesses of his\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThe scout delayed his departure to speak to the generous girl, whose breathing\r\nbecame lighter as she saw the success of her remonstrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWisdom is sometimes given to the young, as well as to the old,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cand what you have spoken is wise, not to call it by a better word.\r\nIf you are led into the woods, that is such of you as may be spared for awhile,\r\nbreak the twigs on the bushes as you pass, and make the marks of your trail as\r\nbroad as you can, when, if mortal eyes can see them, depend on having a friend\r\nwho will follow to the ends of the \xe2\x80\x99arth afore he desarts you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave Cora an affectionate shake of the hand, lifted his rifle, and after\r\nregarding it a moment with melancholy solicitude, laid it carefully aside, and\r\ndescended to the place where Chingachgook had just disappeared. For an instant\r\nhe hung suspended by the rock, and looking about him, with a countenance of\r\npeculiar care, he added bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cHad the powder held out, this disgrace\r\ncould never have befallen!\xe2\x80\x9d then, loosening his hold, the water closed\r\nabove his head, and he also became lost to view.\r\n\r\nAll eyes now were turned on Uncas, who stood leaning against the ragged rock,\r\nin immovable composure. After waiting a short time, Cora pointed down the\r\nriver, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friends have not been seen, and are now, most probably, in safety.\r\nIs it not time for you to follow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncas will stay,\xe2\x80\x9d the young Mohican calmly answered in English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo increase the horror of our capture, and to diminish the chances of\r\nour release! Go, generous young man,\xe2\x80\x9d Cora continued, lowering her eyes\r\nunder the gaze of the Mohican, and perhaps, with an intuitive consciousness of\r\nher power; \xe2\x80\x9cgo to my father, as I have said, and be the most confidential\r\nof my messengers. Tell him to trust you with the means to buy the freedom of\r\nhis daughters. Go! \xe2\x80\x99tis my wish, \xe2\x80\x99tis my prayer, that you will\r\ngo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe settled, calm look of the young chief changed to an expression of gloom,\r\nbut he no longer hesitated. With a noiseless step he crossed the rock, and\r\ndropped into the troubled stream. Hardly a breath was drawn by those he left\r\nbehind, until they caught a glimpse of his head emerging for air, far down the\r\ncurrent, when he again sank, and was seen no more.\r\n\r\nThese sudden and apparently successful experiments had all taken place in a few\r\nminutes of that time which had now become so precious. After a last look at\r\nUncas, Cora turned and with a quivering lip, addressed herself to Heyward:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of your boasted skill in the water, too, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cfollow, then, the wise example set you by these simple and\r\nfaithful beings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs such the faith that Cora Munro would exact from her protector?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the young man, smiling mournfully, but with bitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a time for idle subtleties and false opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a moment when every duty should be equally considered. To\r\nus you can be of no further service here, but your precious life may be saved\r\nfor other and nearer friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, though his eye fell wistfully on the beautiful form of Alice,\r\nwho was clinging to his arm with the dependency of an infant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Cora, after a pause, during which she seemed\r\nto struggle with a pang even more acute than any that her fears had excited,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the worst to us can be but death; a tribute that all must pay at\r\nthe good time of God\xe2\x80\x99s appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are evils worse than death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, speaking hoarsely,\r\nand as if fretful at her importunity, \xe2\x80\x9cbut which the presence of one who\r\nwould die in your behalf may avert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCora ceased her entreaties; and veiling her face in her shawl, drew the nearly\r\ninsensible Alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe gay securely;\r\nDispel, my fair, with smiles, the tim\xe2\x80\x99rous clouds,\r\nThat hang on thy clear brow.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Death of Agrippina\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sudden and almost magical change, from the stirring incidents of the combat\r\nto the stillness that now reigned around him, acted on the heated imagination\r\nof Heyward like some exciting dream. While all the images and events he had\r\nwitnessed remained deeply impressed on his memory, he felt a difficulty in\r\npersuading him of their truth. Still ignorant of the fate of those who had\r\ntrusted to the aid of the swift current, he at first listened intently to any\r\nsignal or sounds of alarm, which might announce the good or evil fortune of\r\ntheir hazardous undertaking. His attention was, however, bestowed in vain; for\r\nwith the disappearance of Uncas, every sign of the adventurers had been lost,\r\nleaving him in total uncertainty of their fate.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of such painful doubt, Duncan did not hesitate to look around him,\r\nwithout consulting that protection from the rocks which just before had been so\r\nnecessary to his safety. Every effort, however, to detect the least evidence of\r\nthe approach of their hidden enemies was as fruitless as the inquiry after his\r\nlate companions. The wooded banks of the river seemed again deserted by\r\neverything possessing animal life. The uproar which had so lately echoed\r\nthrough the vaults of the forest was gone, leaving the rush of the waters to\r\nswell and sink on the currents of the air, in the unmingled sweetness of\r\nnature. A fish-hawk, which, secure on the topmost branches of a dead pine, had\r\nbeen a distant spectator of the fray, now swooped from his high and ragged\r\nperch, and soared, in wide sweeps, above his prey; while a jay, whose noisy\r\nvoice had been stilled by the hoarser cries of the savages, ventured again to\r\nopen his discordant throat, as though once more in undisturbed possession of\r\nhis wild domains. Duncan caught from these natural accompaniments of the\r\nsolitary scene a glimmering of hope; and he began to rally his faculties to\r\nrenewed exertions, with something like a reviving confidence of success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hurons are not to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing David, who had\r\nby no means recovered from the effects of the stunning blow he had received;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet us conceal ourselves in the cavern, and trust the rest to\r\nProvidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember to have united with two comely maidens, in lifting up our\r\nvoices in praise and thanksgiving,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the bewildered\r\nsinging-master; \xe2\x80\x9csince which time I have been visited by a heavy judgment\r\nfor my sins. I have been mocked with the likeness of sleep, while sounds of\r\ndiscord have rent my ears, such as might manifest the fullness of time, and\r\nthat nature had forgotten her harmony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow! thine own period was, in truth, near its accomplishment!\r\nBut arouse, and come with me; I will lead you where all other sounds but those\r\nof your own psalmody shall be excluded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is melody in the fall of the cataract, and the rushing of many\r\nwaters is sweet to the senses!\xe2\x80\x9d said David, pressing his hand confusedly\r\non his brow. \xe2\x80\x9cIs not the air yet filled with shrieks and cries, as though\r\nthe departed spirits of the damned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now, not now,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the impatient Heyward, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nhave ceased, and they who raised them, I trust in God, they are gone, too!\r\neverything but the water is still and at peace; in, then, where you may create\r\nthose sounds you love so well to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid smiled sadly, though not without a momentary gleam of pleasure, at this\r\nallusion to his beloved vocation. He no longer hesitated to be led to a spot\r\nwhich promised such unalloyed gratification to his wearied senses; and leaning\r\non the arm of his companion, he entered the narrow mouth of the cave. Duncan\r\nseized a pile of the sassafras, which he drew before the passage, studiously\r\nconcealing every appearance of an aperture. Within this fragile barrier he\r\narranged the blankets abandoned by the foresters, darkening the inner extremity\r\nof the cavern, while its outer received a chastened light from the narrow\r\nravine, through which one arm of the river rushed to form the junction with its\r\nsister branch a few rods below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like not the principle of the natives, which teaches them to submit\r\nwithout a struggle, in emergencies that appear desperate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, while\r\nbusied in this employment; \xe2\x80\x9cour own maxim, which says, \xe2\x80\x98while life\r\nremains there is hope\xe2\x80\x99, is more consoling, and better suited to a\r\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s temperament. To you, Cora, I will urge no words of idle\r\nencouragement; your own fortitude and undisturbed reason will teach you all\r\nthat may become your sex; but cannot we dry the tears of that trembling weeper\r\non your bosom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am calmer, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, raising herself from the arms of\r\nher sister, and forcing an appearance of composure through her tears;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmuch calmer, now. Surely, in this hidden spot we are safe, we are\r\nsecret, free from injury; we will hope everything from those generous men who\r\nhave risked so much already in our behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow does our gentle Alice speak like a daughter of Munro!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHeyward, pausing to press her hand as he passed toward the outer entrance of\r\nthe cavern. \xe2\x80\x9cWith two such examples of courage before him, a man would be\r\nashamed to prove other than a hero.\xe2\x80\x9d He then seated himself in the center\r\nof the cavern, grasping his remaining pistol with a hand convulsively clenched,\r\nwhile his contracted and frowning eye announced the sullen desperation of his\r\npurpose. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hurons, if they come, may not gain our position so easily\r\nas they think,\xe2\x80\x9d he slowly muttered; and propping his head back against\r\nthe rock, he seemed to await the result in patience, though his gaze was\r\nunceasingly bent on the open avenue to their place of retreat.\r\n\r\nWith the last sound of his voice, a deep, a long, and almost breathless silence\r\nsucceeded. The fresh air of the morning had penetrated the recess, and its\r\ninfluence was gradually felt on the spirits of its inmates. As minute after\r\nminute passed by, leaving them in undisturbed security, the insinuating feeling\r\nof hope was gradually gaining possession of every bosom, though each one felt\r\nreluctant to give utterance to expectations that the next moment might so\r\nfearfully destroy.\r\n\r\nDavid alone formed an exception to these varying emotions. A gleam of light\r\nfrom the opening crossed his wan countenance, and fell upon the pages of the\r\nlittle volume, whose leaves he was again occupied in turning, as if searching\r\nfor some song more fitted to their condition than any that had yet met their\r\neye. He was, most probably, acting all this time under a confused recollection\r\nof the promised consolation of Duncan. At length, it would seem, his patient\r\nindustry found its reward; for, without explanation or apology, he pronounced\r\naloud the words \xe2\x80\x9cIsle of Wight,\xe2\x80\x9d drew a long, sweet sound from his\r\npitch-pipe, and then ran through the preliminary modulations of the air whose\r\nname he had just mentioned, with the sweeter tones of his own musical voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay not this prove dangerous?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cora, glancing her dark eye\r\nat Major Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow! his voice is too feeble to be heard above the din of the\r\nfalls,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer; \xe2\x80\x9cbeside, the cavern will prove his friend.\r\nLet him indulge his passions since it may be done without hazard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsle of Wight!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated David, looking about him with that\r\ndignity with which he had long been wont to silence the whispering echoes of\r\nhis school; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis a brave tune, and set to solemn words! let it be\r\nsung with meet respect!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter allowing a moment of stillness to enforce his discipline, the voice of\r\nthe singer was heard, in low, murmuring syllables, gradually stealing on the\r\near, until it filled the narrow vault with sounds rendered trebly thrilling by\r\nthe feeble and tremulous utterance produced by his debility. The melody, which\r\nno weakness could destroy, gradually wrought its sweet influence on the senses\r\nof those who heard it. It even prevailed over the miserable travesty of the\r\nsong of David which the singer had selected from a volume of similar effusions,\r\nand caused the sense to be forgotten in the insinuating harmony of the sounds.\r\nAlice unconsciously dried her tears, and bent her melting eyes on the pallid\r\nfeatures of Gamut, with an expression of chastened delight that she neither\r\naffected or wished to conceal. Cora bestowed an approving smile on the pious\r\nefforts of the namesake of the Jewish prince, and Heyward soon turned his\r\nsteady, stern look from the outlet of the cavern, to fasten it, with a milder\r\ncharacter, on the face of David, or to meet the wandering beams which at\r\nmoments strayed from the humid eyes of Alice. The open sympathy of the\r\nlisteners stirred the spirit of the votary of music, whose voice regained its\r\nrichness and volume, without losing that touching softness which proved its\r\nsecret charm. Exerting his renovated powers to their utmost, he was yet filling\r\nthe arches of the cave with long and full tones, when a yell burst into the air\r\nwithout, that instantly stilled his pious strains, choking his voice suddenly,\r\nas though his heart had literally bounded into the passage of his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are lost!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Alice, throwing herself into the arms of\r\nCora.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the agitated but undaunted Heyward:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe sound came from the center of the island, and it has been produced\r\nby the sight of their dead companions. We are not yet discovered, and there is\r\nstill hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaint and almost despairing as was the prospect of escape, the words of Duncan\r\nwere not thrown away, for it awakened the powers of the sisters in such a\r\nmanner that they awaited the results in silence. A second yell soon followed\r\nthe first, when a rush of voices was heard pouring down the island, from its\r\nupper to its lower extremity, until they reached the naked rock above the\r\ncaverns, where, after a shout of savage triumph, the air continued full of\r\nhorrible cries and screams, such as man alone can utter, and he only when in a\r\nstate of the fiercest barbarity.\r\n\r\nThe sounds quickly spread around them in every direction. Some called to their\r\nfellows from the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, and were answered from the heights above.\r\nCries were heard in the startling vicinity of the chasm between the two caves,\r\nwhich mingled with hoarser yells that arose out of the abyss of the deep\r\nravine. In short, so rapidly had the savage sounds diffused themselves over the\r\nbarren rock, that it was not difficult for the anxious listeners to imagine\r\nthey could be heard beneath, as in truth they were above on every side of them.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this tumult, a triumphant yell was raised within a few yards of\r\nthe hidden entrance to the cave. Heyward abandoned every hope, with the belief\r\nit was the signal that they were discovered. Again the impression passed away,\r\nas he heard the voices collect near the spot where the white man had so\r\nreluctantly abandoned his rifle. Amid the jargon of Indian dialects that he now\r\nplainly heard, it was easy to distinguish not only words, but sentences, in the\r\npatois of the Canadas. A burst of voices had shouted simultaneously, \xe2\x80\x9cLa\r\nLongue Carabine!\xe2\x80\x9d causing the opposite woods to re-echo with a name\r\nwhich, Heyward well remembered, had been given by his enemies to a celebrated\r\nhunter and scout of the English camp, and who, he now learned for the first\r\ntime, had been his late companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue Carabine! La Longue Carabine!\xe2\x80\x9d passed from mouth to\r\nmouth, until the whole band appeared to be collected around a trophy which\r\nwould seem to announce the death of its formidable owner. After a vociferous\r\nconsultation, which was, at times, deafened by bursts of savage joy, they again\r\nseparated, filling the air with the name of a foe, whose body, Heywood could\r\ncollect from their expressions, they hoped to find concealed in some crevice of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to the trembling sisters, \xe2\x80\x9cnow is the\r\nmoment of uncertainty! if our place of retreat escape this scrutiny, we are\r\nstill safe! In every event, we are assured, by what has fallen from our\r\nenemies, that our friends have escaped, and in two short hours we may look for\r\nsuccor from Webb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were now a few minutes of fearful stillness, during which Heyward well\r\nknew that the savages conducted their search with greater vigilance and method.\r\nMore than once he could distinguish their footsteps, as they brushed the\r\nsassafras, causing the faded leaves to rustle, and the branches to snap. At\r\nlength, the pile yielded a little, a corner of a blanket fell, and a faint ray\r\nof light gleamed into the inner part of the cave. Cora folded Alice to her\r\nbosom in agony, and Duncan sprang to his feet. A shout was at that moment\r\nheard, as if issuing from the center of the rock, announcing that the\r\nneighboring cavern had at length been entered. In a minute, the number and\r\nloudness of the voices indicated that the whole party was collected in and\r\naround that secret place.\r\n\r\nAs the inner passages to the two caves were so close to each other, Duncan,\r\nbelieving that escape was no longer possible, passed David and the sisters, to\r\nplace himself between the latter and the first onset of the terrible meeting.\r\nGrown desperate by his situation, he drew nigh the slight barrier which\r\nseparated him only by a few feet from his relentless pursuers, and placing his\r\nface to the casual opening, he even looked out with a sort of desperate\r\nindifference, on their movements.\r\n\r\nWithin reach of his arm was the brawny shoulder of a gigantic Indian, whose\r\ndeep and authoritative voice appeared to give directions to the proceedings of\r\nhis fellows. Beyond him again, Duncan could look into the vault opposite, which\r\nwas filled with savages, upturning and rifling the humble furniture of the\r\nscout. The wound of David had dyed the leaves of sassafras with a color that\r\nthe native well knew as anticipating the season. Over this sign of their\r\nsuccess, they sent up a howl, like an opening from so many hounds who had\r\nrecovered a lost trail. After this yell of victory, they tore up the fragrant\r\nbed of the cavern, and bore the branches into the chasm, scattering the boughs,\r\nas if they suspected them of concealing the person of the man they had so long\r\nhated and feared. One fierce and wild-looking warrior approached the chief,\r\nbearing a load of the brush, and pointing exultingly to the deep red stains\r\nwith which it was sprinkled, uttered his joy in Indian yells, whose meaning\r\nHeyward was only enabled to comprehend by the frequent repetition of the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue Carabine!\xe2\x80\x9d When his triumph had ceased, he cast the\r\nbrush on the slight heap Duncan had made before the entrance of the second\r\ncavern, and closed the view. His example was followed by others, who, as they\r\ndrew the branches from the cave of the scout, threw them into one pile, adding,\r\nunconsciously, to the security of those they sought. The very slightness of the\r\ndefense was its chief merit, for no one thought of disturbing a mass of brush,\r\nwhich all of them believed, in that moment of hurry and confusion, had been\r\naccidentally raised by the hands of their own party.\r\n\r\nAs the blankets yielded before the outward pressure, and the branches settled\r\nin the fissure of the rock by their own weight, forming a compact body, Duncan\r\nonce more breathed freely. With a light step and lighter heart, he returned to\r\nthe center of the cave, and took the place he had left, where he could command\r\na view of the opening next the river. While he was in the act of making this\r\nmovement, the Indians, as if changing their purpose by a common impulse, broke\r\naway from the chasm in a body, and were heard rushing up the island again,\r\ntoward the point whence they had originally descended. Here another wailing cry\r\nbetrayed that they were again collected around the bodies of their dead\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nDuncan now ventured to look at his companions; for, during the most critical\r\nmoments of their danger, he had been apprehensive that the anxiety of his\r\ncountenance might communicate some additional alarm to those who were so little\r\nable to sustain it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are gone, Cora!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered; \xe2\x80\x9cAlice, they are\r\nreturned whence they came, and we are saved! To Heaven, that has alone\r\ndelivered us from the grasp of so merciless an enemy, be all the praise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen to Heaven will I return my thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the younger\r\nsister, rising from the encircling arm of Cora, and casting herself with\r\nenthusiastic gratitude on the naked rock; \xe2\x80\x9cto that Heaven who has spared\r\nthe tears of a gray-headed father; has saved the lives of those I so much\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth Heyward and the more temperate Cora witnessed the act of involuntary\r\nemotion with powerful sympathy, the former secretly believing that piety had\r\nnever worn a form so lovely as it had now assumed in the youthful person of\r\nAlice. Her eyes were radiant with the glow of grateful feelings; the flush of\r\nher beauty was again seated on her cheeks, and her whole soul seemed ready and\r\nanxious to pour out its thanksgivings through the medium of her eloquent\r\nfeatures. But when her lips moved, the words they should have uttered appeared\r\nfrozen by some new and sudden chill. Her bloom gave place to the paleness of\r\ndeath; her soft and melting eyes grew hard, and seemed contracting with horror;\r\nwhile those hands, which she had raised, clasped in each other, toward heaven,\r\ndropped in horizontal lines before her, the fingers pointed forward in\r\nconvulsed motion. Heyward turned the instant she gave a direction to his\r\nsuspicions, and peering just above the ledge which formed the threshold of the\r\nopen outlet of the cavern, he beheld the malignant, fierce and savage features\r\nof Le Renard Subtil.\r\n\r\nIn that moment of surprise, the self-possession of Heyward did not desert him.\r\nHe observed by the vacant expression of the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, that\r\nhis eye, accustomed to the open air had not yet been able to penetrate the\r\ndusky light which pervaded the depth of the cavern. He had even thought of\r\nretreating beyond a curvature in the natural wall, which might still conceal\r\nhim and his companions, when by the sudden gleam of intelligence that shot\r\nacross the features of the savage, he saw it was too late, and that they were\r\nbetrayed.\r\n\r\nThe look of exultation and brutal triumph which announced this terrible truth\r\nwas irresistibly irritating. Forgetful of everything but the impulses of his\r\nhot blood, Duncan leveled his pistol and fired. The report of the weapon made\r\nthe cavern bellow like an eruption from a volcano; and when the smoke it\r\nvomited had been driven away before the current of air which issued from the\r\nravine the place so lately occupied by the features of his treacherous guide\r\nwas vacant. Rushing to the outlet, Heyward caught a glimpse of his dark figure\r\nstealing around a low and narrow ledge, which soon hid him entirely from sight.\r\n\r\nAmong the savages a frightful stillness succeeded the explosion, which had just\r\nbeen heard bursting from the bowels of the rock. But when Le Renard raised his\r\nvoice in a long and intelligible whoop, it was answered by a spontaneous yell\r\nfrom the mouth of every Indian within hearing of the sound.\r\n\r\nThe clamorous noises again rushed down the island; and before Duncan had time\r\nto recover from the shock, his feeble barrier of brush was scattered to the\r\nwinds, the cavern was entered at both its extremities, and he and his\r\ncompanions were dragged from their shelter and borne into the day, where they\r\nstood surrounded by the whole band of the triumphant Hurons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear we shall outsleep the coming morn\r\nAs much as we this night have overwatched!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instant the shock of this sudden misfortune had abated, Duncan began to\r\nmake his observations on the appearance and proceedings of their captors.\r\nContrary to the usages of the natives in the wantonness of their success they\r\nhad respected, not only the persons of the trembling sisters, but his own. The\r\nrich ornaments of his military attire had indeed been repeatedly handled by\r\ndifferent individuals of the tribes with eyes expressing a savage longing to\r\npossess the baubles; but before the customary violence could be resorted to, a\r\nmandate in the authoritative voice of the large warrior, already mentioned,\r\nstayed the uplifted hand, and convinced Heyward that they were to be reserved\r\nfor some object of particular moment.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, these manifestations of weakness were exhibited by the young\r\nand vain of the party, the more experienced warriors continued their search\r\nthroughout both caverns, with an activity that denoted they were far from being\r\nsatisfied with those fruits of their conquest which had already been brought to\r\nlight. Unable to discover any new victim, these diligent workers of vengeance\r\nsoon approached their male prisoners, pronouncing the name \xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue\r\nCarabine,\xe2\x80\x9d with a fierceness that could not be easily mistaken. Duncan\r\naffected not to comprehend the meaning of their repeated and violent\r\ninterrogatories, while his companion was spared the effort of a similar\r\ndeception by his ignorance of French. Wearied at length by their importunities,\r\nand apprehensive of irritating his captors by too stubborn a silence, the\r\nformer looked about him in quest of Magua, who might interpret his answers to\r\nquestions which were at each moment becoming more earnest and threatening.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of this savage had formed a solitary exception to that of all his\r\nfellows. While the others were busily occupied in seeking to gratify their\r\nchildish passion for finery, by plundering even the miserable effects of the\r\nscout, or had been searching with such bloodthirsty vengeance in their looks\r\nfor their absent owner, Le Renard had stood at a little distance from the\r\nprisoners, with a demeanor so quiet and satisfied, as to betray that he had\r\nalready effected the grand purpose of his treachery. When the eyes of Heyward\r\nfirst met those of his recent guide, he turned them away in horror at the\r\nsinister though calm look he encountered. Conquering his disgust, however, he\r\nwas able, with an averted face, to address his successful enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Renard Subtil is too much of a warrior,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reluctant\r\nHeyward, \xe2\x80\x9cto refuse telling an unarmed man what his conquerors\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ask for the hunter who knows the paths through the woods,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Magua, in his broken English, laying his hand, at the same time, with\r\na ferocious smile, on the bundle of leaves with which a wound on his own\r\nshoulder was bandaged. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98La Longue Carabine\xe2\x80\x99! His rifle is\r\ngood, and his eye never shut; but, like the short gun of the white chief, it is\r\nnothing against the life of Le Subtil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Renard is too brave to remember the hurts received in war, or the\r\nhands that gave them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it war, when the tired Indian rested at the sugartree to taste his\r\ncorn! who filled the bushes with creeping enemies! who drew the knife, whose\r\ntongue was peace, while his heart was colored with blood! Did Magua say that\r\nthe hatchet was out of the ground, and that his hand had dug it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Duncan dared not retort upon his accuser by reminding him of his own\r\npremeditated treachery, and disdained to deprecate his resentment by any words\r\nof apology, he remained silent. Magua seemed also content to rest the\r\ncontroversy as well as all further communication there, for he resumed the\r\nleaning attitude against the rock from which, in momentary energy, he had\r\narisen. But the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue Carabine\xe2\x80\x9d was renewed the instant\r\nthe impatient savages perceived that the short dialogue was ended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magua, with stubborn indifference: \xe2\x80\x9cthe red\r\nHurons call for the life of \xe2\x80\x98The Long Rifle\xe2\x80\x99, or they will have the\r\nblood of him that keep him hid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is gone\xe2\x80\x94escaped; he is far beyond their reach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRenard smiled with cold contempt, as he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the white man dies, he thinks he is at peace; but the red men know\r\nhow to torture even the ghosts of their enemies. Where is his body? Let the\r\nHurons see his scalp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not dead, but escaped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua shook his head incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he a bird, to spread his wings; or is he a fish, to swim without air!\r\nThe white chief read in his books, and he believes the Hurons are fools!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough no fish, \xe2\x80\x98The Long Rifle\xe2\x80\x99 can swim. He floated down\r\nthe stream when the powder was all burned, and when the eyes of the Hurons were\r\nbehind a cloud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why did the white chief stay?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the still incredulous\r\nIndian. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he a stone that goes to the bottom, or does the scalp burn\r\nhis head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I am not stone, your dead comrade, who fell into the falls, might\r\nanswer, were the life still in him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the provoked young man, using,\r\nin his anger, that boastful language which was most likely to excite the\r\nadmiration of an Indian. \xe2\x80\x9cThe white man thinks none but cowards desert\r\ntheir women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua muttered a few words, inaudibly, between his teeth, before he continued,\r\naloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan the Delawares swim, too, as well as crawl in the bushes? Where is\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Le Gros Serpent\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, who perceived by the use of these Canadian appellations, that his late\r\ncompanions were much better known to his enemies than to himself, answered,\r\nreluctantly: \xe2\x80\x9cHe also is gone down with the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Le Cerf Agile\xe2\x80\x99 is not here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not whom you call \xe2\x80\x98The Nimble Deer\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDuncan gladly profiting by any excuse to create delay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncas,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Magua, pronouncing the Delaware name with even\r\ngreater difficulty than he spoke his English words. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bounding\r\nElk\xe2\x80\x99 is what the white man says, when he calls to the young\r\nMohican.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is some confusion in names between us, Le Renard,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDuncan, hoping to provoke a discussion. \xe2\x80\x9cDaim is the French for deer, and\r\ncerf for stag; elan is the true term, when one would speak of an elk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Indian, in his native tongue; \xe2\x80\x9cthe pale\r\nfaces are prattling women! they have two words for each thing, while a red-skin\r\nwill make the sound of his voice speak for him.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, changing his\r\nlanguage, he continued, adhering to the imperfect nomenclature of his\r\nprovincial instructors. \xe2\x80\x9cThe deer is swift, but weak; the elk is swift,\r\nbut strong; and the son of \xe2\x80\x98Le Serpent\xe2\x80\x99 is \xe2\x80\x98Le Cerf\r\nAgile.\xe2\x80\x99 Has he leaped the river to the woods?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean the younger Delaware, he, too, has gone down with the\r\nwater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing improbable to an Indian in the manner of the escape, Magua\r\nadmitted the truth of what he had heard, with a readiness that afforded\r\nadditional evidence how little he would prize such worthless captives. With his\r\ncompanions, however, the feeling was manifestly different.\r\n\r\nThe Hurons had awaited the result of this short dialogue with characteristic\r\npatience, and with a silence that increased until there was a general stillness\r\nin the band. When Heyward ceased to speak, they turned their eyes, as one man,\r\non Magua, demanding, in this expressive manner, an explanation of what had been\r\nsaid. Their interpreter pointed to the river, and made them acquainted with the\r\nresult, as much by the action as by the few words he uttered. When the fact was\r\ngenerally understood, the savages raised a frightful yell, which declared the\r\nextent of their disappointment. Some ran furiously to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge,\r\nbeating the air with frantic gestures, while others spat upon the element, to\r\nresent the supposed treason it had committed against their acknowledged rights\r\nas conquerors. A few, and they not the least powerful and terrific of the band,\r\nthrew lowering looks, in which the fiercest passion was only tempered by\r\nhabitual self-command, at those captives who still remained in their power,\r\nwhile one or two even gave vent to their malignant feelings by the most\r\nmenacing gestures, against which neither the sex nor the beauty of the sisters\r\nwas any protection. The young soldier made a desperate but fruitless effort to\r\nspring to the side of Alice, when he saw the dark hand of a savage twisted in\r\nthe rich tresses which were flowing in volumes over her shoulders, while a\r\nknife was passed around the head from which they fell, as if to denote the\r\nhorrid manner in which it was about to be robbed of its beautiful ornament. But\r\nhis hands were bound; and at the first movement he made, he felt the grasp of\r\nthe powerful Indian who directed the band, pressing his shoulder like a vise.\r\nImmediately conscious how unavailing any struggle against such an overwhelming\r\nforce must prove, he submitted to his fate, encouraging his gentle companions\r\nby a few low and tender assurances, that the natives seldom failed to threaten\r\nmore than they performed.\r\n\r\nBut while Duncan resorted to these words of consolation to quiet the\r\napprehensions of the sisters, he was not so weak as to deceive himself. He well\r\nknew that the authority of an Indian chief was so little conventional, that it\r\nwas oftener maintained by physical superiority than by any moral supremacy he\r\nmight possess. The danger was, therefore, magnified exactly in proportion to\r\nthe number of the savage spirits by which they were surrounded. The most\r\npositive mandate from him who seemed the acknowledged leader, was liable to be\r\nviolated at each moment by any rash hand that might choose to sacrifice a\r\nvictim to the manes of some dead friend or relative. While, therefore, he\r\nsustained an outward appearance of calmness and fortitude, his heart leaped\r\ninto his throat, whenever any of their fierce captors drew nearer than common\r\nto the helpless sisters, or fastened one of their sullen, wandering looks on\r\nthose fragile forms which were so little able to resist the slightest assault.\r\n\r\nHis apprehensions were, however, greatly relieved, when he saw that the leader\r\nhad summoned his warriors to himself in counsel. Their deliberations were\r\nshort, and it would seem, by the silence of most of the party, the decision\r\nunanimous. By the frequency with which the few speakers pointed in the\r\ndirection of the encampment of Webb, it was apparent they dreaded the approach\r\nof danger from that quarter. This consideration probably hastened their\r\ndetermination, and quickened the subsequent movements.\r\n\r\nDuring his short conference, Heyward, finding a respite from his gravest fears,\r\nhad leisure to admire the cautious manner in which the Hurons had made their\r\napproaches, even after hostilities had ceased.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the upper half of the island was a naked rock,\r\nand destitute of any other defenses than a few scattered logs of driftwood.\r\nThey had selected this point to make their descent, having borne the canoe\r\nthrough the wood around the cataract for that purpose. Placing their arms in\r\nthe little vessel a dozen men clinging to its sides had trusted themselves to\r\nthe direction of the canoe, which was controlled by two of the most skillful\r\nwarriors, in attitudes that enabled them to command a view of the dangerous\r\npassage. Favored by this arrangement, they touched the head of the island at\r\nthat point which had proved so fatal to their first adventurers, but with the\r\nadvantages of superior numbers, and the possession of firearms. That such had\r\nbeen the manner of their descent was rendered quite apparent to Duncan; for\r\nthey now bore the light bark from the upper end of the rock, and placed it in\r\nthe water, near the mouth of the outer cavern. As soon as this change was made,\r\nthe leader made signs to the prisoners to descend and enter.\r\n\r\nAs resistance was impossible, and remonstrance useless, Heyward set the example\r\nof submission, by leading the way into the canoe, where he was soon seated with\r\nthe sisters and the still wondering David. Notwithstanding the Hurons were\r\nnecessarily ignorant of the little channels among the eddies and rapids of the\r\nstream, they knew the common signs of such a navigation too well to commit any\r\nmaterial blunder. When the pilot chosen for the task of guiding the canoe had\r\ntaken his station, the whole band plunged again into the river, the vessel\r\nglided down the current, and in a few moments the captives found themselves on\r\nthe south bank of the stream, nearly opposite to the point where they had\r\nstruck it the preceding evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere was held another short but earnest consultation, during which the horses,\r\nto whose panic their owners ascribed their heaviest misfortune, were led from\r\nthe cover of the woods, and brought to the sheltered spot. The band now\r\ndivided. The great chief, so often mentioned, mounting the charger of Heyward,\r\nled the way directly across the river, followed by most of his people, and\r\ndisappeared in the woods, leaving the prisoners in charge of six savages, at\r\nwhose head was Le Renard Subtil. Duncan witnessed all their movements with\r\nrenewed uneasiness.\r\n\r\nHe had been fond of believing, from the uncommon forbearance of the savages,\r\nthat he was reserved as a prisoner to be delivered to Montcalm. As the thoughts\r\nof those who are in misery seldom slumber, and the invention is never more\r\nlively than when it is stimulated by hope, however feeble and remote, he had\r\neven imagined that the parental feelings of Munro were to be made instrumental\r\nin seducing him from his duty to the king. For though the French commander bore\r\na high character for courage and enterprise, he was also thought to be expert\r\nin those political practises which do not always respect the nicer obligations\r\nof morality, and which so generally disgraced the European diplomacy of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAll those busy and ingenious speculations were now annihilated by the conduct\r\nof his captors. That portion of the band who had followed the huge warrior took\r\nthe route toward the foot of the Horican, and no other expectation was left for\r\nhimself and companions, than that they were to be retained as hopeless captives\r\nby their savage conquerors. Anxious to know the worst, and willing, in such an\r\nemergency, to try the potency of gold he overcame his reluctance to speak to\r\nMagua. Addressing himself to his former guide, who had now assumed the\r\nauthority and manner of one who was to direct the future movements of the\r\nparty, he said, in tones as friendly and confiding as he could assume:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would speak to Magua, what is fit only for so great a chief to\r\nhear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian turned his eyes on the young soldier scornfully, as he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak; trees have no ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the red Hurons are not deaf; and counsel that is fit for the great\r\nmen of a nation would make the young warriors drunk. If Magua will not listen,\r\nthe officer of the king knows how to be silent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe savage spoke carelessly to his comrades, who were busied, after their\r\nawkward manner, in preparing the horses for the reception of the sisters, and\r\nmoved a little to one side, whither by a cautious gesture he induced Heyward to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cif the words are such as Magua should\r\nhear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Renard Subtil has proved himself worthy of the honorable name given\r\nto him by his Canada fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d commenced Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cI see his\r\nwisdom, and all that he has done for us, and shall remember it when the hour to\r\nreward him arrives. Yes! Renard has proved that he is not only a great chief in\r\ncouncil, but one who knows how to deceive his enemies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has Renard done?\xe2\x80\x9d coldly demanded the Indian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! has he not seen that the woods were filled with outlying parties\r\nof the enemies, and that the serpent could not steal through them without being\r\nseen? Then, did he not lose his path to blind the eyes of the Hurons? Did he\r\nnot pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him\r\nfrom their wigwams like a dog? And, when we saw what he wished to do, did we\r\nnot aid him, by making a false face, that the Hurons might think the white man\r\nbelieved that his friend was his enemy? Is not all this true? And when Le\r\nSubtil had shut the eyes and stopped the ears of his nation by his wisdom, did\r\nthey not forget that they had once done him wrong, and forced him to flee to\r\nthe Mohawks? And did they not leave him on the south side of the river, with\r\ntheir prisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north? Does not Renard\r\nmean to turn like a fox on his footsteps, and to carry to the rich and\r\ngray-headed Scotchman his daughters? Yes, Magua, I see it all, and I have\r\nalready been thinking how so much wisdom and honesty should be repaid. First,\r\nthe chief of William Henry will give as a great chief should for such a\r\nservice. The medal[1]\r\nof Magua will no longer be of tin, but of beaten gold; his horn will run over\r\nwith powder; dollars will be as plenty in his pouch as pebbles on the shore of\r\nHorican; and the deer will lick his hand, for they will know it to be vain to\r\nfly from the rifle he will carry! As for myself, I know not how to exceed the\r\ngratitude of the Scotchman, but I\xe2\x80\x94yes, I will\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nIt has long been a practice with the whites to conciliate the important men\r\nof the Indians by presenting medals, which are worn in the place of their own\r\nrude ornaments. Those given by the English generally bear the impression of the\r\nreigning king, and those given by the Americans that of the president.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will the young chief, who comes from toward the sun, give?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded the Huron, observing that Heyward hesitated in his desire to end the\r\nenumeration of benefits with that which might form the climax of an\r\nIndian\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will make the fire-water from the islands in the salt lake flow\r\nbefore the wigwam of Magua, until the heart of the Indian shall be lighter than\r\nthe feathers of the humming-bird, and his breath sweeter than the wild\r\nhoneysuckle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLe Renard had listened gravely as Heyward slowly proceeded in this subtle\r\nspeech. When the young man mentioned the artifice he supposed the Indian to\r\nhave practised on his own nation, the countenance of the listener was veiled in\r\nan expression of cautious gravity. At the allusion to the injury which Duncan\r\naffected to believe had driven the Huron from his native tribe, a gleam of such\r\nungovernable ferocity flashed from the other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as induced the\r\nadventurous speaker to believe he had struck the proper chord. And by the time\r\nhe reached the part where he so artfully blended the thirst of vengeance with\r\nthe desire of gain, he had, at least, obtained a command of the deepest\r\nattention of the savage. The question put by Le Renard had been calm, and with\r\nall the dignity of an Indian; but it was quite apparent, by the thoughtful\r\nexpression of the listener\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, that the answer was most\r\ncunningly devised. The Huron mused a few moments, and then laying his hand on\r\nthe rude bandages of his wounded shoulder, he said, with some energy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo friends make such marks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould \xe2\x80\x98La Longue Carbine\xe2\x80\x99 cut one so slight on an\r\nenemy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo the Delawares crawl upon those they love like snakes, twisting\r\nthemselves to strike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould \xe2\x80\x98Le Gros Serpent\xe2\x80\x99 have been heard by the ears of one\r\nhe wished to be deaf?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the white chief burn his powder in the faces of his\r\nbrothers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he ever miss his aim, when seriously bent to kill?\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nDuncan, smiling with well acted sincerity.\r\n\r\nAnother long and deliberate pause succeeded these sententious questions and\r\nready replies. Duncan saw that the Indian hesitated. In order to complete his\r\nvictory, he was in the act of recommencing the enumeration of the rewards, when\r\nMagua made an expressive gesture and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough; Le Renard is a wise chief, and what he does will be seen. Go,\r\nand keep the mouth shut. When Magua speaks, it will be the time to\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward, perceiving that the eyes of his companion were warily fastened on the\r\nrest of the band, fell back immediately, in order to avoid the appearance of\r\nany suspicious confederacy with their leader. Magua approached the horses, and\r\naffected to be well pleased with the diligence and ingenuity of his comrades.\r\nHe then signed to Heyward to assist the sisters into the saddles, for he seldom\r\ndeigned to use the English tongue, unless urged by some motive of more than\r\nusual moment.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any plausible pretext for delay; and Duncan was obliged,\r\nhowever reluctantly, to comply. As he performed this office, he whispered his\r\nreviving hopes in the ears of the trembling females, who, through dread of\r\nencountering the savage countenances of their captors, seldom raised their eyes\r\nfrom the ground. The mare of David had been taken with the followers of the\r\nlarge chief; in consequence, its owner, as well as Duncan, was compelled to\r\njourney on foot. The latter did not, however, so much regret this circumstance,\r\nas it might enable him to retard the speed of the party; for he still turned\r\nhis longing looks in the direction of Fort Edward, in the vain expectation of\r\ncatching some sound from that quarter of the forest, which might denote the\r\napproach of succor. When all were prepared, Magua made the signal to proceed,\r\nadvancing in front to lead the party in person. Next followed David, who was\r\ngradually coming to a true sense of his condition, as the effects of the wound\r\nbecame less and less apparent. The sisters rode in his rear, with Heyward at\r\ntheir side, while the Indians flanked the party, and brought up the close of\r\nthe march, with a caution that seemed never to tire.\r\n\r\nIn this manner they proceeded in uninterrupted silence, except when Heyward\r\naddressed some solitary word of comfort to the females, or David gave vent to\r\nthe moanings of his spirit, in piteous exclamations, which he intended should\r\nexpress the humility of resignation. Their direction lay toward the south, and\r\nin a course nearly opposite to the road to William Henry. Notwithstanding this\r\napparent adherence in Magua to the original determination of his conquerors,\r\nHeyward could not believe his tempting bait was so soon forgotten; and he knew\r\nthe windings of an Indian\xe2\x80\x99s path too well to suppose that its apparent\r\ncourse led directly to its object, when artifice was at all necessary. Mile\r\nafter mile was, however, passed through the boundless woods, in this painful\r\nmanner, without any prospect of a termination to their journey. Heyward watched\r\nthe sun, as he darted his meridian rays through the branches of the trees, and\r\npined for the moment when the policy of Magua should change their route to one\r\nmore favorable to his hopes. Sometimes he fancied the wary savage, despairing\r\nof passing the army of Montcalm in safety, was holding his way toward a\r\nwell-known border settlement, where a distinguished officer of the crown, and a\r\nfavored friend of the Six Nations, held his large possessions, as well as his\r\nusual residence. To be delivered into the hands of Sir William Johnson was far\r\npreferable to being led into the wilds of Canada; but in order to effect even\r\nthe former, it would be necessary to traverse the forest for many weary\r\nleagues, each step of which was carrying him further from the scene of the war,\r\nand, consequently, from the post, not only of honor, but of duty.\r\n\r\nCora alone remembered the parting injunctions of the scout, and whenever an\r\nopportunity offered, she stretched forth her arm to bend aside the twigs that\r\nmet her hands. But the vigilance of the Indians rendered this act of precaution\r\nboth difficult and dangerous. She was often defeated in her purpose, by\r\nencountering their watchful eyes, when it became necessary to feign an alarm\r\nshe did not feel, and occupy the limb by some gesture of feminine apprehension.\r\nOnce, and once only, was she completely successful; when she broke down the\r\nbough of a large sumach, and by a sudden thought, let her glove fall at the\r\nsame instant. This sign, intended for those that might follow, was observed by\r\none of her conductors, who restored the glove, broke the remaining branches of\r\nthe bush in such a manner that it appeared to proceed from the struggling of\r\nsome beast in its branches, and then laid his hand on his tomahawk, with a look\r\nso significant, that it put an effectual end to these stolen memorials of their\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nAs there were horses, to leave the prints of their footsteps, in both bands of\r\nthe Indians, this interruption cut off any probable hopes of assistance being\r\nconveyed through the means of their trail.\r\n\r\nHeyward would have ventured a remonstrance had there been anything encouraging\r\nin the gloomy reserve of Magua. But the savage, during all this time, seldom\r\nturned to look at his followers, and never spoke. With the sun for his only\r\nguide, or aided by such blind marks as are only known to the sagacity of a\r\nnative, he held his way along the barrens of pine, through occasional little\r\nfertile vales, across brooks and rivulets, and over undulating hills, with the\r\naccuracy of instinct, and nearly with the directness of a bird. He never seemed\r\nto hesitate. Whether the path was hardly distinguishable, whether it\r\ndisappeared, or whether it lay beaten and plain before him, made no sensible\r\ndifference in his speed or certainty. It seemed as if fatigue could not affect\r\nhim. Whenever the eyes of the wearied travelers rose from the decayed leaves\r\nover which they trod, his dark form was to be seen glancing among the stems of\r\nthe trees in front, his head immovably fastened in a forward position, with the\r\nlight plume on his crest fluttering in a current of air, made solely by the\r\nswiftness of his own motion.\r\n\r\nBut all this diligence and speed were not without an object. After crossing a\r\nlow vale, through which a gushing brook meandered, he suddenly ascended a hill,\r\nso steep and difficult of ascent, that the sisters were compelled to alight in\r\norder to follow. When the summit was gained, they found themselves on a level\r\nspot, but thinly covered with trees, under one of which Magua had thrown his\r\ndark form, as if willing and ready to seek that rest which was so much needed\r\nby the whole party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCursed be my tribe If I forgive him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shylock\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian had selected for this desirable purpose one of those steep,\r\npyramidal hills, which bear a strong resemblance to artificial mounds, and\r\nwhich so frequently occur in the valleys of America. The one in question was\r\nhigh and precipitous; its top flattened, as usual; but with one of its sides\r\nmore than ordinarily irregular. It possessed no other apparent advantage for a\r\nresting place, than in its elevation and form, which might render defense easy,\r\nand surprise nearly impossible. As Heyward, however, no longer expected that\r\nrescue which time and distance now rendered so improbable, he regarded these\r\nlittle peculiarities with an eye devoid of interest, devoting himself entirely\r\nto the comfort and condolence of his feebler companions. The Narragansetts were\r\nsuffered to browse on the branches of the trees and shrubs that were thinly\r\nscattered over the summit of the hill, while the remains of their provisions\r\nwere spread under the shade of a beech, that stretched its horizontal limbs\r\nlike a canopy above them.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the swiftness of their flight, one of the Indians had found an\r\nopportunity to strike a straggling fawn with an arrow, and had borne the more\r\npreferable fragments of the victim, patiently on his shoulders, to the stopping\r\nplace. Without any aid from the science of cookery, he was immediately\r\nemployed, in common with his fellows, in gorging himself with this digestible\r\nsustenance. Magua alone sat apart, without participating in the revolting meal,\r\nand apparently buried in the deepest thought.\r\n\r\nThis abstinence, so remarkable in an Indian, when he possessed the means of\r\nsatisfying hunger, at length attracted the notice of Heyward. The young man\r\nwillingly believed that the Huron deliberated on the most eligible manner of\r\neluding the vigilance of his associates. With a view to assist his plans by any\r\nsuggestion of his own, and to strengthen the temptation, he left the beech, and\r\nstraggled, as if without an object, to the spot where Le Renard was seated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas not Magua kept the sun in his face long enough to escape all danger\r\nfrom the Canadians?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as though no longer doubtful of the good\r\nintelligence established between them; \xe2\x80\x9cand will not the chief of William\r\nHenry be better pleased to see his daughters before another night may have\r\nhardened his heart to their loss, to make him less liberal in his\r\nreward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo the pale faces love their children less in the morning than at\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Indian, coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Heyward, anxious to recall his error, if he\r\nhad made one; \xe2\x80\x9cthe white man may, and does often, forget the burial place\r\nof his fathers; he sometimes ceases to remember those he should love, and has\r\npromised to cherish; but the affection of a parent for his child is never\r\npermitted to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is the heart of the white-headed chief soft, and will he think of\r\nthe babes that his squaws have given him? He is hard on his warriors and his\r\neyes are made of stone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is severe to the idle and wicked, but to the sober and deserving he\r\nis a leader, both just and humane. I have known many fond and tender parents,\r\nbut never have I seen a man whose heart was softer toward his child. You have\r\nseen the gray-head in front of his warriors, Magua; but I have seen his eyes\r\nswimming in water, when he spoke of those children who are now in your\r\npower!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward paused, for he knew not how to construe the remarkable expression that\r\ngleamed across the swarthy features of the attentive Indian. At first it seemed\r\nas if the remembrance of the promised reward grew vivid in his mind, while he\r\nlistened to the sources of parental feeling which were to assure its\r\npossession; but, as Duncan proceeded, the expression of joy became so fiercely\r\nmalignant that it was impossible not to apprehend it proceeded from some\r\npassion more sinister than avarice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Huron, suppressing the alarming exhibition in an\r\ninstant, in a death-like calmness of countenance; \xe2\x80\x9cgo to the dark-haired\r\ndaughter, and say, \xe2\x80\x98Magua waits to speak.\xe2\x80\x99 The father will remember\r\nwhat the child promises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, who interpreted this speech to express a wish for some additional\r\npledge that the promised gifts should not be withheld, slowly and reluctantly\r\nrepaired to the place where the sisters were now resting from their fatigue, to\r\ncommunicate its purport to Cora.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand the nature of an Indian\xe2\x80\x99s wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nconcluded, as he led her toward the place where she was expected, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nmust be prodigal of your offers of powder and blankets. Ardent spirits are,\r\nhowever, the most prized by such as he; nor would it be amiss to add some boon\r\nfrom your own hand, with that grace you so well know how to practise. Remember,\r\nCora, that on your presence of mind and ingenuity, even your life, as well as\r\nthat of Alice, may in some measure depend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyward, and yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine is of little moment; it is already sold to my king, and is a prize\r\nto be seized by any enemy who may possess the power. I have no father to expect\r\nme, and but few friends to lament a fate which I have courted with the\r\ninsatiable longings of youth after distinction. But hush! we approach the\r\nIndian. Magua, the lady with whom you wish to speak, is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian rose slowly from his seat, and stood for near a minute silent and\r\nmotionless. He then signed with his hand for Heyward to retire, saying, coldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Huron talks to the women, his tribe shut their ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, still lingering, as if refusing to comply, Cora said, with a calm\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear, Heyward, and delicacy at least should urge you to retire. Go\r\nto Alice, and comfort her with our reviving prospects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited until he had departed, and then turning to the native, with the\r\ndignity of her sex in her voice and manner, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would Le\r\nRenard say to the daughter of Munro?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Indian, laying his hand firmly upon her arm, as\r\nif willing to draw her utmost attention to his words; a movement that Cora as\r\nfirmly but quietly repulsed, by extricating the limb from his grasp:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagua was born a chief and a warrior among the red Hurons of the lakes;\r\nhe saw the suns of twenty summers make the snows of twenty winters run off in\r\nthe streams before he saw a pale face; and he was happy! Then his Canada\r\nfathers came into the woods, and taught him to drink the fire-water, and he\r\nbecame a rascal. The Hurons drove him from the graves of his fathers, as they\r\nwould chase the hunted buffalo. He ran down the shores of the lakes, and\r\nfollowed their outlet to the \xe2\x80\x98city of cannon.\xe2\x80\x99 There he hunted and\r\nfished, till the people chased him again through the woods into the arms of his\r\nenemies. The chief, who was born a Huron, was at last a warrior among the\r\nMohawks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething like this I had heard before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora, observing that\r\nhe paused to suppress those passions which began to burn with too bright a\r\nflame, as he recalled the recollection of his supposed injuries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it the fault of Le Renard that his head was not made of rock? Who\r\ngave him the fire-water? who made him a villain? \xe2\x80\x99Twas the pale faces,\r\nthe people of your own color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I answerable that thoughtless and unprincipled men exist, whose\r\nshades of countenance may resemble mine?\xe2\x80\x9d Cora calmly demanded of the\r\nexcited savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; Magua is a man, and not a fool; such as you never open their lips to\r\nthe burning stream: the Great Spirit has given you wisdom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then, have I do to, or say, in the matter of your misfortunes, not\r\nto say of your errors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Indian, resuming his earnest attitude;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen his English and French fathers dug up the hatchet, Le Renard struck\r\nthe war-post of the Mohawks, and went out against his own nation. The pale\r\nfaces have driven the red-skins from their hunting grounds, and now when they\r\nfight, a white man leads the way. The old chief at Horican, your father, was\r\nthe great captain of our war-party. He said to the Mohawks do this, and do\r\nthat, and he was minded. He made a law, that if an Indian swallowed the\r\nfire-water, and came into the cloth wigwams of his warriors, it should not be\r\nforgotten. Magua foolishly opened his mouth, and the hot liquor led him into\r\nthe cabin of Munro. What did the gray-head? let his daughter say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe forgot not his words, and did justice, by punishing the\r\noffender,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undaunted daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJustice!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Indian, casting an oblique glance of the\r\nmost ferocious expression at her unyielding countenance; \xe2\x80\x9cis it justice\r\nto make evil and then punish for it? Magua was not himself; it was the\r\nfire-water that spoke and acted for him! but Munro did believe it. The Huron\r\nchief was tied up before all the pale-faced warriors, and whipped like a\r\ndog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCora remained silent, for she knew not how to palliate this imprudent severity\r\non the part of her father in a manner to suit the comprehension of an Indian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Magua, tearing aside the slight calico that very\r\nimperfectly concealed his painted breast; \xe2\x80\x9chere are scars given by knives\r\nand bullets\xe2\x80\x94of these a warrior may boast before his nation; but the\r\ngray-head has left marks on the back of the Huron chief that he must hide like\r\na squaw, under this painted cloth of the whites.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had thought,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Cora, \xe2\x80\x9cthat an Indian warrior was\r\npatient, and that his spirit felt not and knew not the pain his body\r\nsuffered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Chippewas tied Magua to the stake, and cut this gash,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the other, laying his finger on a deep scar, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Huron laughed in\r\ntheir faces, and told them, Women struck so light! His spirit was then in the\r\nclouds! But when he felt the blows of Munro, his spirit lay under the birch.\r\nThe spirit of a Huron is never drunk; it remembers forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it may be appeased. If my father has done you this injustice, show\r\nhim how an Indian can forgive an injury, and take back his daughters. You have\r\nheard from Major Heyward\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua shook his head, forbidding the repetition of offers he so much despised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Cora, after a most painful pause,\r\nwhile the conviction forced itself on her mind that the too sanguine and\r\ngenerous Duncan had been cruelly deceived by the cunning of the savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a Huron loves\xe2\x80\x94good for good; bad for bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would, then, revenge the injury inflicted by Munro on his helpless\r\ndaughters. Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and take the\r\nsatisfaction of a warrior?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe arms of the pale faces are long, and their knives sharp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the savage, with a malignant laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should Le Renard go\r\namong the muskets of his warriors, when he holds the spirit of the gray-head in\r\nhis hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName your intention, Magua,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora, struggling with herself to\r\nspeak with steady calmness. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it to lead us prisoners to the woods, or\r\ndo you contemplate even some greater evil? Is there no reward, no means of\r\npalliating the injury, and of softening your heart? At least, release my gentle\r\nsister, and pour out all your malice on me. Purchase wealth by her safety and\r\nsatisfy your revenge with a single victim. The loss of both his daughters might\r\nbring the aged man to his grave, and where would then be the satisfaction of Le\r\nRenard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Indian again. \xe2\x80\x9cThe light eyes can go back\r\nto the Horican, and tell the old chief what has been done, if the dark-haired\r\nwoman will swear by the Great Spirit of her fathers to tell no lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must I promise?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Cora, still maintaining a secret\r\nascendancy over the fierce native by the collected and feminine dignity of her\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Magua left his people his wife was given to another chief; he has\r\nnow made friends with the Hurons, and will go back to the graves of his tribe,\r\non the shores of the great lake. Let the daughter of the English chief follow,\r\nand live in his wigwam forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever revolting a proposal of such a character might prove to Cora, she\r\nretained, notwithstanding her powerful disgust, sufficient self-command to\r\nreply, without betraying the weakness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what pleasure would Magua find in sharing his cabin with a wife he\r\ndid not love; one who would be of a nation and color different from his own? It\r\nwould be better to take the gold of Munro, and buy the heart of some Huron maid\r\nwith his gifts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian made no reply for near a minute, but bent his fierce looks on the\r\ncountenance of Cora, in such wavering glances, that her eyes sank with shame,\r\nunder an impression that for the first time they had encountered an expression\r\nthat no chaste female might endure. While she was shrinking within herself, in\r\ndread of having her ears wounded by some proposal still more shocking than the\r\nlast, the voice of Magua answered, in its tones of deepest malignancy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the blows scorched the back of the Huron, he would know where to\r\nfind a woman to feel the smart. The daughter of Munro would draw his water, hoe\r\nhis corn, and cook his venison. The body of the gray-head would sleep among his\r\ncannon, but his heart would lie within reach of the knife of Le Subtil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonster! well dost thou deserve thy treacherous name,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cora,\r\nin an ungovernable burst of filial indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cNone but a fiend could\r\nmeditate such a vengeance. But thou overratest thy power! You shall find it is,\r\nin truth, the heart of Munro you hold, and that it will defy your utmost\r\nmalice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian answered this bold defiance by a ghastly smile, that showed an\r\nunaltered purpose, while he motioned her away, as if to close the conference\r\nforever. Cora, already regretting her precipitation, was obliged to comply, for\r\nMagua instantly left the spot, and approached his gluttonous comrades. Heyward\r\nflew to the side of the agitated female, and demanded the result of a dialogue\r\nthat he had watched at a distance with so much interest. But, unwilling to\r\nalarm the fears of Alice, she evaded a direct reply, betraying only by her\r\nanxious looks fastened on the slightest movements of her captors. To the\r\nreiterated and earnest questions of her sister concerning their probable\r\ndestination, she made no other answer than by pointing toward the dark group,\r\nwith an agitation she could not control, and murmuring as she folded Alice to\r\nher bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there; read our fortunes in their faces; we shall see; we shall\r\nsee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe action, and the choked utterance of Cora, spoke more impressively than any\r\nwords, and quickly drew the attention of her companions on that spot where her\r\nown was riveted with an intenseness that nothing but the importance of the\r\nstake could create.\r\n\r\nWhen Magua reached the cluster of lolling savages, who, gorged with their\r\ndisgusting meal, lay stretched on the earth in brutal indulgence, he commenced\r\nspeaking with the dignity of an Indian chief. The first syllables he uttered\r\nhad the effect to cause his listeners to raise themselves in attitudes of\r\nrespectful attention. As the Huron used his native language, the prisoners,\r\nnotwithstanding the caution of the natives had kept them within the swing of\r\ntheir tomahawks, could only conjecture the substance of his harangue from the\r\nnature of those significant gestures with which an Indian always illustrates\r\nhis eloquence.\r\n\r\nAt first, the language, as well as the action of Magua, appeared calm and\r\ndeliberative. When he had succeeded in sufficiently awakening the attention of\r\nhis comrades, Heyward fancied, by his pointing so frequently toward the\r\ndirection of the great lakes, that he spoke of the land of their fathers, and\r\nof their distant tribe. Frequent indications of applause escaped the listeners,\r\nwho, as they uttered the expressive \xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d looked at each other in\r\ncommendation of the speaker. Le Renard was too skillful to neglect his\r\nadvantage. He now spoke of the long and painful route by which they had left\r\nthose spacious grounds and happy villages, to come and battle against the\r\nenemies of their Canadian fathers. He enumerated the warriors of the party;\r\ntheir several merits; their frequent services to the nation; their wounds, and\r\nthe number of the scalps they had taken. Whenever he alluded to any present\r\n(and the subtle Indian neglected none), the dark countenance of the flattered\r\nindividual gleamed with exultation, nor did he even hesitate to assert the\r\ntruth of the words, by gestures of applause and confirmation. Then the voice of\r\nthe speaker fell, and lost the loud, animated tones of triumph with which he\r\nhad enumerated their deeds of success and victory. He described the cataract of\r\nGlenn\xe2\x80\x99s; the impregnable position of its rocky island, with its caverns\r\nand its numerous rapids and whirlpools; he named the name of \xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue\r\nCarabine,\xe2\x80\x9d and paused until the forest beneath them had sent up the last\r\necho of a loud and long yell, with which the hated appellation was received. He\r\npointed toward the youthful military captive, and described the death of a\r\nfavorite warrior, who had been precipitated into the deep ravine by his hand.\r\nHe not only mentioned the fate of him who, hanging between heaven and earth,\r\nhad presented such a spectacle of horror to the whole band, but he acted anew\r\nthe terrors of his situation, his resolution and his death, on the branches of\r\na sapling; and, finally, he rapidly recounted the manner in which each of their\r\nfriends had fallen, never failing to touch upon their courage, and their most\r\nacknowledged virtues. When this recital of events was ended, his voice once\r\nmore changed, and became plaintive and even musical, in its low guttural\r\nsounds. He now spoke of the wives and children of the slain; their destitution;\r\ntheir misery, both physical and moral; their distance; and, at last, of their\r\nunavenged wrongs. Then suddenly lifting his voice to a pitch of terrific\r\nenergy, he concluded by demanding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the Hurons dogs to bear this? Who shall say to the wife of Menowgua\r\nthat the fishes have his scalp, and that his nation have not taken revenge! Who\r\nwill dare meet the mother of Wassawattimie, that scornful woman, with his hands\r\nclean! What shall be said to the old men when they ask us for scalps, and we\r\nhave not a hair from a white head to give them! The women will point their\r\nfingers at us. There is a dark spot on the names of the Hurons, and it must be\r\nhid in blood!\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was no longer audible in the burst of rage which\r\nnow broke into the air, as if the wood, instead of containing so small a band,\r\nwas filled with the nation. During the foregoing address the progress of the\r\nspeaker was too plainly read by those most interested in his success through\r\nthe medium of the countenances of the men he addressed. They had answered his\r\nmelancholy and mourning by sympathy and sorrow; his assertions, by gestures of\r\nconfirmation; and his boasting, with the exultation of savages. When he spoke\r\nof courage, their looks were firm and responsive; when he alluded to their\r\ninjuries, their eyes kindled with fury; when he mentioned the taunts of the\r\nwomen, they dropped their heads in shame; but when he pointed out their means\r\nof vengeance, he struck a chord which never failed to thrill in the breast of\r\nan Indian. With the first intimation that it was within their reach, the whole\r\nband sprang upon their feet as one man; giving utterance to their rage in the\r\nmost frantic cries, they rushed upon their prisoners in a body with drawn\r\nknives and uplifted tomahawks. Heyward threw himself between the sisters and\r\nthe foremost, whom he grappled with a desperate strength that for a moment\r\nchecked his violence. This unexpected resistance gave Magua time to interpose,\r\nand with rapid enunciation and animated gesture, he drew the attention of the\r\nband again to himself. In that language he knew so well how to assume, he\r\ndiverted his comrades from their instant purpose, and invited them to prolong\r\nthe misery of their victims. His proposal was received with acclamations, and\r\nexecuted with the swiftness of thought.\r\n\r\nTwo powerful warriors cast themselves on Heyward, while another was occupied in\r\nsecuring the less active singing-master. Neither of the captives, however,\r\nsubmitted without a desperate, though fruitless, struggle. Even David hurled\r\nhis assailant to the earth; nor was Heyward secured until the victory over his\r\ncompanion enabled the Indians to direct their united force to that object. He\r\nwas then bound and fastened to the body of the sapling, on whose branches Magua\r\nhad acted the pantomime of the falling Huron. When the young soldier regained\r\nhis recollection, he had the painful certainty before his eyes that a common\r\nfate was intended for the whole party. On his right was Cora in a durance\r\nsimilar to his own, pale and agitated, but with an eye whose steady look still\r\nread the proceedings of their enemies. On his left, the withes which bound her\r\nto a pine, performed that office for Alice which her trembling limbs refused,\r\nand alone kept her fragile form from sinking. Her hands were clasped before her\r\nin prayer, but instead of looking upward toward that power which alone could\r\nrescue them, her unconscious looks wandered to the countenance of Duncan with\r\ninfantile dependency. David had contended, and the novelty of the circumstance\r\nheld him silent, in deliberation on the propriety of the unusual occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe vengeance of the Hurons had now taken a new direction, and they prepared to\r\nexecute it with that barbarous ingenuity with which they were familiarized by\r\nthe practise of centuries. Some sought knots, to raise the blazing pile; one\r\nwas riving the splinters of pine, in order to pierce the flesh of their\r\ncaptives with the burning fragments; and others bent the tops of two saplings\r\nto the earth, in order to suspend Heyward by the arms between the recoiling\r\nbranches. But the vengeance of Magua sought a deeper and more malignant\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nWhile the less refined monsters of the band prepared, before the eyes of those\r\nwho were to suffer, these well-known and vulgar means of torture, he approached\r\nCora, and pointed out, with the most malign expression of countenance, the\r\nspeedy fate that awaited her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat says the daughter of Munro? Her head is\r\ntoo good to find a pillow in the wigwam of Le Renard; will she like it better\r\nwhen it rolls about this hill a plaything for the wolves? Her bosom cannot\r\nnurse the children of a Huron; she will see it spit upon by Indians!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat means the monster!\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the astonished Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d was the firm reply. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a savage, a barbarous\r\nand ignorant savage, and knows not what he does. Let us find leisure, with our\r\ndying breath, to ask for him penitence and pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the fierce Huron, mistaking in his anger, the\r\nmeaning of her words; \xe2\x80\x9cthe memory of an Indian is no longer than the arm\r\nof the pale faces; his mercy shorter than their justice! Say; shall I send the\r\nyellow hair to her father, and will you follow Magua to the great lakes, to\r\ncarry his water, and feed him with corn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCora beckoned him away, with an emotion of disgust she could not control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a solemnity that for a moment checked\r\nthe barbarity of the Indian; \xe2\x80\x9cyou mingle bitterness in my prayers; you\r\nstand between me and my God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe slight impression produced on the savage was, however, soon forgotten, and\r\nhe continued pointing, with taunting irony, toward Alice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! the child weeps! She is too young to die! Send her to Munro, to\r\ncomb his gray hairs, and keep life in the heart of the old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCora could not resist the desire to look upon her youthful sister, in whose\r\neyes she met an imploring glance, that betrayed the longings of nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat says he, dearest Cora?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the trembling voice of Alice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he speak of sending me to our father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor many moments the elder sister looked upon the younger, with a countenance\r\nthat wavered with powerful and contending emotions. At length she spoke, though\r\nher tones had lost their rich and calm fullness, in an expression of tenderness\r\nthat seemed maternal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Huron offers us both life, nay, more\r\nthan both; he offers to restore Duncan, our invaluable Duncan, as well as you,\r\nto our friends\xe2\x80\x94to our father\xe2\x80\x94to our heart-stricken, childless\r\nfather, if I will bow down this rebellious, stubborn pride of mine, and\r\nconsent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice became choked, and clasping her hands, she looked upward, as if\r\nseeking, in her agony, intelligence from a wisdom that was infinite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay on,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Alice; \xe2\x80\x9cto what, dearest Cora? Oh! that the\r\nproffer were made to me! to save you, to cheer our aged father, to restore\r\nDuncan, how cheerfully could I die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDie!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Cora, with a calmer and firmer voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nwere easy! Perhaps the alternative may not be less so. He would have me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe continued, her accents sinking under a deep consciousness of the\r\ndegradation of the proposal, \xe2\x80\x9cfollow him to the wilderness; go to the\r\nhabitations of the Hurons; to remain there; in short, to become his wife!\r\nSpeak, then, Alice; child of my affections! sister of my love! And you, too,\r\nMajor Heyward, aid my weak reason with your counsel. Is life to be purchased by\r\nsuch a sacrifice? Will you, Alice, receive it at my hands at such a price? And\r\nyou, Duncan, guide me; control me between you; for I am wholly yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould I!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the indignant and astonished youth. \xe2\x80\x9cCora!\r\nCora! you jest with our misery! Name not the horrid alternative again; the\r\nthought itself is worse than a thousand deaths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat such would be your answer, I well knew!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cora, her\r\ncheeks flushing, and her dark eyes once more sparkling with the lingering\r\nemotions of a woman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat says my Alice? for her will I submit without\r\nanother murmur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough both Heyward and Cora listened with painful suspense and the deepest\r\nattention, no sounds were heard in reply. It appeared as if the delicate and\r\nsensitive form of Alice would shrink into itself, as she listened to this\r\nproposal. Her arms had fallen lengthwise before her, the fingers moving in\r\nslight convulsions; her head dropped upon her bosom, and her whole person\r\nseemed suspended against the tree, looking like some beautiful emblem of the\r\nwounded delicacy of her sex, devoid of animation and yet keenly conscious. In a\r\nfew moments, however, her head began to move slowly, in a sign of deep,\r\nunconquerable disapprobation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no; better that we die as we have lived, together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen die!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Magua, hurling his tomahawk\r\nwith violence at the unresisting speaker\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen die!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Magua, hurling his tomahawk with violence at\r\nthe unresisting speaker, and gnashing his teeth with a rage that could no\r\nlonger be bridled at this sudden exhibition of firmness in the one he believed\r\nthe weakest of the party. The axe cleaved the air in front of Heyward, and\r\ncutting some of the flowing ringlets of Alice, quivered in the tree above her\r\nhead. The sight maddened Duncan to desperation. Collecting all his energies in\r\none effort he snapped the twigs which bound him and rushed upon another savage,\r\nwho was preparing, with loud yells and a more deliberate aim, to repeat the\r\nblow. They encountered, grappled, and fell to the earth together. The naked\r\nbody of his antagonist afforded Heyward no means of holding his adversary, who\r\nglided from his grasp, and rose again with one knee on his chest, pressing him\r\ndown with the weight of a giant. Duncan already saw the knife gleaming in the\r\nair, when a whistling sound swept past him, and was rather accompanied than\r\nfollowed by the sharp crack of a rifle. He felt his breast relieved from the\r\nload it had endured; he saw the savage expression of his adversary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance change to a look of vacant wildness, when the Indian fell dead on\r\nthe faded leaves by his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClo.\xe2\x80\x94I am gone, sire,\r\nAnd anon, sire, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be with you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twelfth Night\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hurons stood aghast at this sudden visitation of death on one of their\r\nband. But as they regarded the fatal accuracy of an aim which had dared to\r\nimmolate an enemy at so much hazard to a friend, the name of \xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue\r\nCarabine\xe2\x80\x9d burst simultaneously from every lip, and was succeeded by a\r\nwild and a sort of plaintive howl. The cry was answered by a loud shout from a\r\nlittle thicket, where the incautious party had piled their arms; and at the\r\nnext moment, Hawkeye, too eager to load the rifle he had regained, was seen\r\nadvancing upon them, brandishing the clubbed weapon, and cutting the air with\r\nwide and powerful sweeps. Bold and rapid as was the progress of the scout, it\r\nwas exceeded by that of a light and vigorous form which, bounding past him,\r\nleaped, with incredible activity and daring, into the very center of the\r\nHurons, where it stood, whirling a tomahawk, and flourishing a glittering\r\nknife, with fearful menaces, in front of Cora. Quicker than the thoughts could\r\nfollow those unexpected and audacious movements, an image, armed in the\r\nemblematic panoply of death, glided before their eyes, and assumed a\r\nthreatening attitude at the other\xe2\x80\x99s side. The savage tormentors recoiled\r\nbefore these warlike intruders, and uttered, as they appeared in such quick\r\nsuccession, the often repeated and peculiar exclamations of surprise, followed\r\nby the well-known and dreaded appellations of:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Cerf Agile! Le Gros Serpent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the wary and vigilant leader of the Hurons was not so easily disconcerted.\r\nCasting his keen eyes around the little plain, he comprehended the nature of\r\nthe assault at a glance, and encouraging his followers by his voice as well as\r\nby his example, he unsheathed his long and dangerous knife, and rushed with a\r\nloud whoop upon the expected Chingachgook. It was the signal for a general\r\ncombat. Neither party had firearms, and the contest was to be decided in the\r\ndeadliest manner, hand to hand, with weapons of offense, and none of defense.\r\n\r\nUncas answered the whoop, and leaping on an enemy, with a single, well-directed\r\nblow of his tomahawk, cleft him to the brain. Heyward tore the weapon of Magua\r\nfrom the sapling, and rushed eagerly toward the fray. As the combatants were\r\nnow equal in number, each singled an opponent from the adverse band. The rush\r\nand blows passed with the fury of a whirlwind, and the swiftness of lightning.\r\nHawkeye soon got another enemy within reach of his arm, and with one sweep of\r\nhis formidable weapon he beat down the slight and inartificial defenses of his\r\nantagonist, crushing him to the earth with the blow. Heyward ventured to hurl\r\nthe tomahawk he had seized, too ardent to await the moment of closing. It\r\nstruck the Indian he had selected on the forehead, and checked for an instant\r\nhis onward rush. Encouraged by this slight advantage, the impetuous young man\r\ncontinued his onset, and sprang upon his enemy with naked hands. A single\r\ninstant was enough to assure him of the rashness of the measure, for he\r\nimmediately found himself fully engaged, with all his activity and courage, in\r\nendeavoring to ward the desperate thrusts made with the knife of the Huron.\r\nUnable longer to foil an enemy so alert and vigilant, he threw his arms about\r\nhim, and succeeded in pinning the limbs of the other to his side, with an iron\r\ngrasp, but one that was far too exhausting to himself to continue long. In this\r\nextremity he heard a voice near him, shouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtarminate the varlets! no quarter to an accursed Mingo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the next moment, the breech of Hawkeye\xe2\x80\x99s rifle fell on the naked head\r\nof his adversary, whose muscles appeared to wither under the shock, as he sank\r\nfrom the arms of Duncan, flexible and motionless.\r\n\r\nWhen Uncas had brained his first antagonist, he turned, like a hungry lion, to\r\nseek another. The fifth and only Huron disengaged at the first onset had paused\r\na moment, and then seeing that all around him were employed in the deadly\r\nstrife, he had sought, with hellish vengeance, to complete the baffled work of\r\nrevenge. Raising a shout of triumph, he sprang toward the defenseless Cora,\r\nsending his keen axe as the dreadful precursor of his approach. The tomahawk\r\ngrazed her shoulder, and cutting the withes which bound her to the tree, left\r\nthe maiden at liberty to fly. She eluded the grasp of the savage, and reckless\r\nof her own safety, threw herself on the bosom of Alice, striving with convulsed\r\nand ill-directed fingers, to tear asunder the twigs which confined the person\r\nof her sister. Any other than a monster would have relented at such an act of\r\ngenerous devotion to the best and purest affection; but the breast of the Huron\r\nwas a stranger to sympathy. Seizing Cora by the rich tresses which fell in\r\nconfusion about her form, he tore her from her frantic hold, and bowed her down\r\nwith brutal violence to her knees. The savage drew the flowing curls through\r\nhis hand, and raising them on high with an outstretched arm, he passed the\r\nknife around the exquisitely molded head of his victim, with a taunting and\r\nexulting laugh. But he purchased this moment of fierce gratification with the\r\nloss of the fatal opportunity. It was just then the sight caught the eye of\r\nUncas. Bounding from his footsteps he appeared for an instant darting through\r\nthe air and descending in a ball he fell on the chest of his enemy, driving him\r\nmany yards from the spot, headlong and prostrate. The violence of the exertion\r\ncast the young Mohican at his side. They arose together, fought, and bled, each\r\nin his turn. But the conflict was soon decided; the tomahawk of Heyward and the\r\nrifle of Hawkeye descended on the skull of the Huron, at the same moment that\r\nthe knife of Uncas reached his heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe battle was now entirely terminated with the exception of the protracted\r\nstruggle between \xe2\x80\x9cLe Renard Subtil\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLe Gros\r\nSerpent.\xe2\x80\x9d Well did these barbarous warriors prove that they deserved\r\nthose significant names which had been bestowed for deeds in former wars. When\r\nthey engaged, some little time was lost in eluding the quick and vigorous\r\nthrusts which had been aimed at their lives. Suddenly darting on each other,\r\nthey closed, and came to the earth, twisted together like twining serpents, in\r\npliant and subtle folds. At the moment when the victors found themselves\r\nunoccupied, the spot where these experienced and desperate combatants lay could\r\nonly be distinguished by a cloud of dust and leaves, which moved from the\r\ncenter of the little plain toward its boundary, as if raised by the passage of\r\na whirlwind. Urged by the different motives of filial affection, friendship and\r\ngratitude, Heyward and his companions rushed with one accord to the place,\r\nencircling the little canopy of dust which hung above the warriors. In vain did\r\nUncas dart around the cloud, with a wish to strike his knife into the heart of\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s foe; the threatening rifle of Hawkeye was raised and\r\nsuspended in vain, while Duncan endeavored to seize the limbs of the Huron with\r\nhands that appeared to have lost their power. Covered as they were with dust\r\nand blood, the swift evolutions of the combatants seemed to incorporate their\r\nbodies into one. The death-like looking figure of the Mohican, and the dark\r\nform of the Huron, gleamed before their eyes in such quick and confused\r\nsuccession, that the friends of the former knew not where to plant the\r\nsuccoring blow. It is true there were short and fleeting moments, when the\r\nfiery eyes of Magua were seen glittering, like the fabled organs of the\r\nbasilisk through the dusty wreath by which he was enveloped, and he read by\r\nthose short and deadly glances the fate of the combat in the presence of his\r\nenemies; ere, however, any hostile hand could descend on his devoted head, its\r\nplace was filled by the scowling visage of Chingachgook. In this manner the\r\nscene of the combat was removed from the center of the little plain to its\r\nverge. The Mohican now found an opportunity to make a powerful thrust with his\r\nknife; Magua suddenly relinquished his grasp, and fell backward without motion,\r\nand seemingly without life. His adversary leaped on his feet, making the arches\r\nof the forest ring with the sounds of triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done for the Delawares! victory to the Mohicans!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nHawkeye, once more elevating the butt of the long and fatal rifle; \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nfinishing blow from a man without a cross will never tell against his honor,\r\nnor rob him of his right to the scalp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at the very moment when the dangerous weapon was in the act of descending,\r\nthe subtle Huron rolled swiftly from beneath the danger, over the edge of the\r\nprecipice, and falling on his feet, was seen leaping, with a single bound, into\r\nthe center of a thicket of low bushes, which clung along its sides. The\r\nDelawares, who had believed their enemy dead, uttered their exclamation of\r\nsurprise, and were following with speed and clamor, like hounds in open view of\r\nthe deer, when a shrill and peculiar cry from the scout instantly changed their\r\npurpose, and recalled them to the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas like himself!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the inveterate forester, whose\r\nprejudices contributed so largely to veil his natural sense of justice in all\r\nmatters which concerned the Mingoes; \xe2\x80\x9ca lying and deceitful varlet as he\r\nis. An honest Delaware now, being fairly vanquished, would have lain still, and\r\nbeen knocked on the head, but these knavish Maquas cling to life like so many\r\ncats-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-mountain. Let him go\xe2\x80\x94let him go; \xe2\x80\x99tis but one\r\nman, and he without rifle or bow, many a long mile from his French commerades;\r\nand like a rattler that lost his fangs, he can do no further mischief, until\r\nsuch time as he, and we too, may leave the prints of our moccasins over a long\r\nreach of sandy plain. See, Uncas,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in Delaware, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nfather is flaying the scalps already. It may be well to go round and feel the\r\nvagabonds that are left, or we may have another of them loping through the\r\nwoods, and screeching like a jay that has been winged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying the honest but implacable scout made the circuit of the dead, into\r\nwhose senseless bosoms he thrust his long knife, with as much coolness as\r\nthough they had been so many brute carcasses. He had, however, been anticipated\r\nby the elder Mohican, who had already torn the emblems of victory from the\r\nunresisting heads of the slain.\r\n\r\nBut Uncas, denying his habits, we had almost said his nature, flew with\r\ninstinctive delicacy, accompanied by Heyward, to the assistance of the females,\r\nand quickly releasing Alice, placed her in the arms of Cora. We shall not\r\nattempt to describe the gratitude to the Almighty Disposer of Events which\r\nglowed in the bosoms of the sisters, who were thus unexpectedly restored to\r\nlife and to each other. Their thanksgivings were deep and silent; the offerings\r\nof their gentle spirits burning brightest and purest on the secret altars of\r\ntheir hearts; and their renovated and more earthly feelings exhibiting\r\nthemselves in long and fervent though speechless caresses. As Alice rose from\r\nher knees, where she had sunk by the side of Cora, she threw herself on the\r\nbosom of the latter, and sobbed aloud the name of their aged father, while her\r\nsoft, dove-like eyes, sparkled with the rays of hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are saved! we are saved!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured; \xe2\x80\x9cto return to the\r\narms of our dear, dear father, and his heart will not be broken with grief. And\r\nyou, too, Cora, my sister, my more than sister, my mother; you, too, are\r\nspared. And Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, looking round upon the youth with a smile\r\nof ineffable innocence, \xe2\x80\x9ceven our own brave and noble Duncan has escaped\r\nwithout a hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo these ardent and nearly innocent words Cora made no other answer than by\r\nstraining the youthful speaker to her heart, as she bent over her in melting\r\ntenderness. The manhood of Heyward felt no shame in dropping tears over this\r\nspectacle of affectionate rapture; and Uncas stood, fresh and blood-stained\r\nfrom the combat, a calm, and, apparently, an unmoved looker-on, it is true, but\r\nwith eyes that had already lost their fierceness, and were beaming with a\r\nsympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence, and advanced him\r\nprobably centuries before, the practises of his nation.\r\n\r\nDuring this display of emotions so natural in their situation, Hawkeye, whose\r\nvigilant distrust had satisfied itself that the Hurons, who disfigured the\r\nheavenly scene, no longer possessed the power to interrupt its harmony,\r\napproached David, and liberated him from the bonds he had, until that moment,\r\nendured with the most exemplary patience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the scout, casting the last withe behind him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are once more master of your own limbs, though you seem not to use\r\nthem with much greater judgment than that in which they were first fashioned.\r\nIf advice from one who is not older than yourself, but who, having lived most\r\nof his time in the wilderness, may be said to have experience beyond his years,\r\nwill give no offense, you are welcome to my thoughts; and these are, to part\r\nwith the little tooting instrument in your jacket to the first fool you meet\r\nwith, and buy some we\xe2\x80\x99pon with the money, if it be only the barrel of a\r\nhorseman\xe2\x80\x99s pistol. By industry and care, you might thus come to some\r\nprefarment; for by this time, I should think, your eyes would plainly tell you\r\nthat a carrion crow is a better bird than a mocking-thresher. The one will, at\r\nleast, remove foul sights from before the face of man, while the other is only\r\ngood to brew disturbances in the woods, by cheating the ears of all that hear\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArms and the clarion for the battle, but the song of thanksgiving to the\r\nvictory!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the liberated David. \xe2\x80\x9cFriend,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nthrusting forth his lean, delicate hand toward Hawkeye, in kindness, while his\r\neyes twinkled and grew moist, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank thee that the hairs of my head\r\nstill grow where they were first rooted by Providence; for, though those of\r\nother men may be more glossy and curling, I have ever found mine own well\r\nsuited to the brain they shelter. That I did not join myself to the battle, was\r\nless owing to disinclination, than to the bonds of the heathen. Valiant and\r\nskillful hast thou proved thyself in the conflict, and I hereby thank thee,\r\nbefore proceeding to discharge other and more important duties, because thou\r\nhast proved thyself well worthy of a Christian\xe2\x80\x99s praise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is but a trifle, and what you may often see if you tarry long\r\namong us,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, a good deal softened toward the man of\r\nsong, by this unequivocal expression of gratitude. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got back my\r\nold companion, \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, striking his hand on\r\nthe breech of his rifle; \xe2\x80\x9cand that in itself is a victory. These Iroquois\r\nare cunning, but they outwitted themselves when they placed their firearms out\r\nof reach; and had Uncas or his father been gifted with only their common Indian\r\npatience, we should have come in upon the knaves with three bullets instead of\r\none, and that would have made a finish of the whole pack; yon loping varlet, as\r\nwell as his commerades. But \xe2\x80\x99twas all fore-ordered, and for the\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou sayest well,\xe2\x80\x9d returned David, \xe2\x80\x9cand hast caught the true\r\nspirit of Christianity. He that is to be saved will be saved, and he that is\r\npredestined to be damned will be damned. This is the doctrine of truth, and\r\nmost consoling and refreshing it is to the true believer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout, who by this time was seated, examining into the state of his rifle\r\nwith a species of parental assiduity, now looked up at the other in a\r\ndispleasure that he did not affect to conceal, roughly interrupting further\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctrine or no doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sturdy woodsman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis the belief of knaves, and the curse of an honest man. I can\r\ncredit that yonder Huron was to fall by my hand, for with my own eyes I have\r\nseen it; but nothing short of being a witness will cause me to think he has met\r\nwith any reward, or that Chingachgook there will be condemned at the final\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no warranty for such an audacious doctrine, nor any covenant to\r\nsupport it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried David who was deeply tinctured with the subtle\r\ndistinctions which, in his time, and more especially in his province, had been\r\ndrawn around the beautiful simplicity of revelation, by endeavoring to\r\npenetrate the awful mystery of the divine nature, supplying faith by\r\nself-sufficiency, and by consequence, involving those who reasoned from such\r\nhuman dogmas in absurdities and doubt; \xe2\x80\x9cyour temple is reared on the\r\nsands, and the first tempest will wash away its foundation. I demand your\r\nauthorities for such an uncharitable assertion (like other advocates of a\r\nsystem, David was not always accurate in his use of terms). Name chapter and\r\nverse; in which of the holy books do you find language to support you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBook!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Hawkeye, with singular and ill-concealed disdain;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo you take me for a whimpering boy at the apronstring of one of your\r\nold gals; and this good rifle on my knee for the feather of a goose\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwing, my ox\xe2\x80\x99s horn for a bottle of ink, and my leathern pouch for a\r\ncross-barred handkercher to carry my dinner? Book! what have such as I, who am\r\na warrior of the wilderness, though a man without a cross, to do with books? I\r\nnever read but in one, and the words that are written there are too simple and\r\ntoo plain to need much schooling; though I may boast that of forty long and\r\nhard-working years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat call you the volume?\xe2\x80\x9d said David, misconceiving the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis open before your eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhe who owns it is not a niggard of its use. I have heard it said that there are\r\nmen who read in books to convince themselves there is a God. I know not but man\r\nmay so deform his works in the settlement, as to leave that which is so clear\r\nin the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests. If any such\r\nthere be, and he will follow me from sun to sun, through the windings of the\r\nforest, he shall see enough to teach him that he is a fool, and that the\r\ngreatest of his folly lies in striving to rise to the level of One he can never\r\nequal, be it in goodness, or be it in power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant David discovered that he battled with a disputant who imbibed his\r\nfaith from the lights of nature, eschewing all subtleties of doctrine, he\r\nwillingly abandoned a controversy from which he believed neither profit nor\r\ncredit was to be derived. While the scout was speaking, he had also seated\r\nhimself, and producing the ready little volume and the iron-rimmed spectacles,\r\nhe prepared to discharge a duty, which nothing but the unexpected assault he\r\nhad received in his orthodoxy could have so long suspended. He was, in truth, a\r\nminstrel of the western continent\xe2\x80\x94of a much later day, certainly, than\r\nthose gifted bards, who formerly sang the profane renown of baron and prince,\r\nbut after the spirit of his own age and country; and he was now prepared to\r\nexercise the cunning of his craft, in celebration of, or rather in thanksgiving\r\nfor, the recent victory. He waited patiently for Hawkeye to cease, then lifting\r\nhis eyes, together with his voice, he said, aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI invite you, friends, to join in praise for this signal deliverance\r\nfrom the hands of barbarians and infidels, to the comfortable and solemn tones\r\nof the tune called \xe2\x80\x98Northampton\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe next named the page and verse where the rhymes selected were to be found,\r\nand applied the pitch-pipe to his lips, with the decent gravity that he had\r\nbeen wont to use in the temple. This time he was, however, without any\r\naccompaniment, for the sisters were just then pouring out those tender\r\neffusions of affection which have been already alluded to. Nothing deterred by\r\nthe smallness of his audience, which, in truth, consisted only of the\r\ndiscontented scout, he raised his voice, commencing and ending the sacred song\r\nwithout accident or interruption of any kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHawkeye listened while he coolly adjusted his flint and reloaded his rifle; but\r\nthe sounds, wanting the extraneous assistance of scene and sympathy, failed to\r\nawaken his slumbering emotions. Never minstrel, or by whatever more suitable\r\nname David should be known, drew upon his talents in the presence of more\r\ninsensible auditors; though considering the singleness and sincerity of his\r\nmotive, it is probable that no bard of profane song ever uttered notes that\r\nascended so near to that throne where all homage and praise is due. The scout\r\nshook his head, and muttering some unintelligible words, among which\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthroat\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIroquois\xe2\x80\x9d were alone audible, he walked\r\naway, to collect and to examine into the state of the captured arsenal of the\r\nHurons. In this office he was now joined by Chingachgook, who found his own, as\r\nwell as the rifle of his son, among the arms. Even Heyward and David were\r\nfurnished with weapons; nor was ammunition wanting to render them all\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\nWhen the foresters had made their selection, and distributed their prizes, the\r\nscout announced that the hour had arrived when it was necessary to move. By\r\nthis time the song of Gamut had ceased, and the sisters had learned to still\r\nthe exhibition of their emotions. Aided by Duncan and the younger Mohican, the\r\ntwo latter descended the precipitous sides of that hill which they had so\r\nlately ascended under so very different auspices, and whose summit had so\r\nnearly proved the scene of their massacre. At the foot they found the\r\nNarragansetts browsing the herbage of the bushes, and having mounted, they\r\nfollowed the movements of a guide, who, in the most deadly straits, had so\r\noften proved himself their friend. The journey was, however, short. Hawkeye,\r\nleaving the blind path that the Hurons had followed, turned short to his right,\r\nand entering the thicket, he crossed a babbling brook, and halted in a narrow\r\ndell, under the shade of a few water elms. Their distance from the base of the\r\nfatal hill was but a few rods, and the steeds had been serviceable only in\r\ncrossing the shallow stream.\r\n\r\nThe scout and the Indians appeared to be familiar with the sequestered place\r\nwhere they now were; for, leaning their rifle against the trees, they commenced\r\nthrowing aside the dried leaves, and opening the blue clay, out of which a\r\nclear and sparkling spring of bright, glancing water, quickly bubbled. The\r\nwhite man then looked about him, as though seeking for some object, which was\r\nnot to be found as readily as he expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem careless imps, the Mohawks, with their Tuscarora and Onondaga\r\nbrethren, have been here slaking their thirst,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthe vagabonds have thrown away the gourd! This is the way with benefits, when\r\nthey are bestowed on such disremembering hounds! Here has the Lord laid his\r\nhand, in the midst of the howling wilderness, for their good, and raised a\r\nfountain of water from the bowels of the \xe2\x80\x99arth, that might laugh at the\r\nrichest shop of apothecary\xe2\x80\x99s ware in all the colonies; and see! the\r\nknaves have trodden in the clay, and deformed the cleanliness of the place, as\r\nthough they were brute beasts, instead of human men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas silently extended toward him the desired gourd, which the spleen of\r\nHawkeye had hitherto prevented him from observing on a branch of an elm.\r\nFilling it with water, he retired a short distance, to a place where the ground\r\nwas more firm and dry; here he coolly seated himself, and after taking a long,\r\nand, apparently, a grateful draught, he commenced a very strict examination of\r\nthe fragments of food left by the Hurons, which had hung in a wallet on his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, lad!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, returning the empty gourd to Uncas;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnow we will see how these rampaging Hurons lived, when outlying in\r\nambushments. Look at this! The varlets know the better pieces of the deer; and\r\none would think they might carve and roast a saddle, equal to the best cook in\r\nthe land! But everything is raw, for the Iroquois are thorough savages. Uncas,\r\ntake my steel and kindle a fire; a mouthful of a tender broil will give\r\nnatur\xe2\x80\x99 a helping hand, after so long a trail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward, perceiving that their guides now set about their repast in sober\r\nearnest, assisted the ladies to alight, and placed himself at their side, not\r\nunwilling to enjoy a few moments of grateful rest, after the bloody scene he\r\nhad just gone through. While the culinary process was in hand, curiosity\r\ninduced him to inquire into the circumstances which had led to their timely and\r\nunexpected rescue:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it that we see you so soon, my generous friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand without aid from the garrison of Edward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad we gone to the bend in the river, we might have been in time to rake\r\nthe leaves over your bodies, but too late to have saved your scalps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncoolly answered the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; instead of throwing away strength and\r\nopportunity by crossing to the fort, we lay by, under the bank of the Hudson,\r\nwaiting to watch the movements of the Hurons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were, then, witnesses of all that passed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot of all; for Indian sight is too keen to be easily cheated, and we\r\nkept close. A difficult matter it was, too, to keep this Mohican boy snug in\r\nthe ambushment. Ah! Uncas, Uncas, your behavior was more like that of a curious\r\nwoman than of a warrior on his scent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas permitted his eyes to turn for an instant on the sturdy countenance of\r\nthe speaker, but he neither spoke nor gave any indication of repentance. On the\r\ncontrary, Heyward thought the manner of the young Mohican was disdainful, if\r\nnot a little fierce, and that he suppressed passions that were ready to\r\nexplode, as much in compliment to the listeners, as from the deference he\r\nusually paid to his white associate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw our capture?\xe2\x80\x9d Heyward next demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe heard it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the significant answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Indian yell is\r\nplain language to men who have passed their days in the woods. But when you\r\nlanded, we were driven to crawl like sarpents, beneath the leaves; and then we\r\nlost sight of you entirely, until we placed eyes on you again trussed to the\r\ntrees, and ready bound for an Indian massacre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur rescue was the deed of Providence. It was nearly a miracle that you\r\ndid not mistake the path, for the Hurons divided, and each band had its\r\nhorses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! there we were thrown off the scent, and might, indeed, have lost the\r\ntrail, had it not been for Uncas; we took the path, however, that led into the\r\nwilderness; for we judged, and judged rightly, that the savages would hold that\r\ncourse with their prisoners. But when we had followed it for many miles,\r\nwithout finding a single twig broken, as I had advised, my mind misgave me;\r\nespecially as all the footsteps had the prints of moccasins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur captors had the precaution to see us shod like themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Duncan, raising a foot, and exhibiting the buckskin he wore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, \xe2\x80\x99twas judgmatical and like themselves; though we were too\r\nexpart to be thrown from a trail by so common an invention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what, then, are we indebted for our safety?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what, as a white man who has no taint of Indian blood, I should be\r\nashamed to own; to the judgment of the young Mohican, in matters which I should\r\nknow better than he, but which I can now hardly believe to be true, though my\r\nown eyes tell me it is so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis extraordinary! will you not name the reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncas was bold enough to say, that the beasts ridden by the gentle\r\nones,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hawkeye, glancing his eyes, not without curious\r\ninterest, on the fillies of the ladies, \xe2\x80\x9cplanted the legs of one side on\r\nthe ground at the same time, which is contrary to the movements of all trotting\r\nfour-footed animals of my knowledge, except the bear. And yet here are horses\r\nthat always journey in this manner, as my own eyes have seen, and as their\r\ntrail has shown for twenty long miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the merit of the animal! They come from the shores of\r\nNarrangansett Bay, in the small province of Providence Plantations, and are\r\ncelebrated for their hardihood, and the ease of this peculiar movement; though\r\nother horses are not unfrequently trained to the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be\xe2\x80\x94it may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, who had listened with\r\nsingular attention to this explanation; \xe2\x80\x9cthough I am a man who has the\r\nfull blood of the whites, my judgment in deer and beaver is greater than in\r\nbeasts of burden. Major Effingham has many noble chargers, but I have never\r\nseen one travel after such a sidling gait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; for he would value the animals for very different properties.\r\nStill is this a breed highly esteemed and, as you witness, much honored with\r\nthe burdens it is often destined to bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mohicans had suspended their operations about the glimmering fire to\r\nlisten; and, when Duncan had done, they looked at each other significantly, the\r\nfather uttering the never-failing exclamation of surprise. The scout ruminated,\r\nlike a man digesting his newly-acquired knowledge, and once more stole a glance\r\nat the horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare to say there are even stranger sights to be seen in the\r\nsettlements!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at length. \xe2\x80\x9cNatur\xe2\x80\x99 is sadly abused by\r\nman, when he once gets the mastery. But, go sidling or go straight, Uncas had\r\nseen the movement, and their trail led us on to the broken bush. The outer\r\nbranch, near the prints of one of the horses, was bent upward, as a lady breaks\r\na flower from its stem, but all the rest were ragged and broken down, as if the\r\nstrong hand of a man had been tearing them! So I concluded that the cunning\r\nvarments had seen the twig bent, and had torn the rest, to make us believe a\r\nbuck had been feeling the boughs with his antlers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe your sagacity did not deceive you; for some such thing\r\noccurred!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was easy to see,\xe2\x80\x9d added the scout, in no degree conscious of\r\nhaving exhibited any extraordinary sagacity; \xe2\x80\x9cand a very different matter\r\nit was from a waddling horse! It then struck me the Mingoes would push for this\r\nspring, for the knaves well know the vartue of its waters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it, then, so famous?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward, examining, with a more\r\ncurious eye, the secluded dell, with its bubbling fountain, surrounded, as it\r\nwas, by earth of a deep, dingy brown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFew red-skins, who travel south and east of the great lakes but have\r\nheard of its qualities. Will you taste for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward took the gourd, and after swallowing a little of the water, threw it\r\naside with grimaces of discontent. The scout laughed in his silent but\r\nheartfelt manner, and shook his head with vast satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you want the flavor that one gets by habit; the time was when I\r\nliked it as little as yourself; but I have come to my taste, and I now crave\r\nit, as a deer does the licks[1].\r\nYour high-spiced wines are not better liked than a red-skin relishes this\r\nwater; especially when his natur\xe2\x80\x99 is ailing. But Uncas has made his fire,\r\nand it is time we think of eating, for our journey is long, and all before\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nMany of the animals of the American forests resort to those spots where salt\r\nsprings are found. These are called \xe2\x80\x9clicks\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csalt\r\nlicks,\xe2\x80\x9d in the language of the country, from the circumstance that the\r\nquadruped is often obliged to lick the earth, in order to obtain the saline\r\nparticles. These licks are great places of resort with the hunters, who waylay\r\ntheir game near the paths that lead to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterrupting the dialogue by this abrupt transition, the scout had instant\r\nrecourse to the fragments of food which had escaped the voracity of the Hurons.\r\nA very summary process completed the simple cookery, when he and the Mohicans\r\ncommenced their humble meal, with the silence and characteristic diligence of\r\nmen who ate in order to enable themselves to endure great and unremitting toil.\r\n\r\nWhen this necessary, and, happily, grateful duty had been performed, each of\r\nthe foresters stooped and took a long and parting draught at that solitary and\r\nsilent spring[2],\r\naround which and its sister fountains, within fifty years, the wealth, beauty\r\nand talents of a hemisphere were to assemble in throngs, in pursuit of health\r\nand pleasure. Then Hawkeye announced his determination to proceed. The sisters\r\nresumed their saddles; Duncan and David grapsed their rifles, and followed on\r\nfootsteps; the scout leading the advance, and the Mohicans bringing up the\r\nrear. The whole party moved swiftly through the narrow path, toward the north,\r\nleaving the healing waters to mingle unheeded with the adjacent brooks and the\r\nbodies of the dead to fester on the neighboring mount, without the rites of\r\nsepulture; a fate but too common to the warriors of the woods to excite either\r\ncommiseration or comment.\r\n\r\n [2]\r\nThe scene of the foregoing incidents is on the spot where the village of\r\nBallston now stands; one of the two principal watering places of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll seek a readier path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Parnell\r\n\r\n\r\nThe route taken by Hawkeye lay across those sandy plains, relived by occasional\r\nvalleys and swells of land, which had been traversed by their party on the\r\nmorning of the same day, with the baffled Magua for their guide. The sun had\r\nnow fallen low toward the distant mountains; and as their journey lay through\r\nthe interminable forest, the heat was no longer oppressive. Their progress, in\r\nconsequence, was proportionate; and long before the twilight gathered about\r\nthem, they had made good many toilsome miles on their return.\r\n\r\nThe hunter, like the savage whose place he filled, seemed to select among the\r\nblind signs of their wild route, with a species of instinct, seldom abating his\r\nspeed, and never pausing to deliberate. A rapid and oblique glance at the moss\r\non the trees, with an occasional upward gaze toward the setting sun, or a\r\nsteady but passing look at the direction of the numerous water courses, through\r\nwhich he waded, were sufficient to determine his path, and remove his greatest\r\ndifficulties. In the meantime, the forest began to change its hues, losing that\r\nlively green which had embellished its arches, in the graver light which is the\r\nusual precursor of the close of day.\r\n\r\nWhile the eyes of the sisters were endeavoring to catch glimpses through the\r\ntrees, of the flood of golden glory which formed a glittering halo around the\r\nsun, tinging here and there with ruby streaks, or bordering with narrow edgings\r\nof shining yellow, a mass of clouds that lay piled at no great distance above\r\nthe western hills, Hawkeye turned suddenly and pointing upward toward the\r\ngorgeous heavens, he spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder is the signal given to man to seek his food and natural\r\nrest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbetter and wiser would it be, if he could\r\nunderstand the signs of nature, and take a lesson from the fowls of the air and\r\nthe beasts of the field! Our night, however, will soon be over, for with the\r\nmoon we must be up and moving again. I remember to have fou\xe2\x80\x99t the Maquas,\r\nhereaways, in the first war in which I ever drew blood from man; and we threw\r\nup a work of blocks, to keep the ravenous varmints from handling our scalps. If\r\nmy marks do not fail me, we shall find the place a few rods further to our\r\nleft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an assent, or, indeed, for any reply, the sturdy hunter\r\nmoved boldly into a dense thicket of young chestnuts, shoving aside the\r\nbranches of the exuberant shoots which nearly covered the ground, like a man\r\nwho expected, at each step, to discover some object he had formerly known. The\r\nrecollection of the scout did not deceive him. After penetrating through the\r\nbrush, matted as it was with briars, for a few hundred feet, he entered an open\r\nspace, that surrounded a low, green hillock, which was crowned by the decayed\r\nblockhouse in question. This rude and neglected building was one of those\r\ndeserted works, which, having been thrown up on an emergency, had been\r\nabandoned with the disappearance of danger, and was now quietly crumbling in\r\nthe solitude of the forest, neglected and nearly forgotten, like the\r\ncircumstances which had caused it to be reared. Such memorials of the passage\r\nand struggles of man are yet frequent throughout the broad barrier of\r\nwilderness which once separated the hostile provinces, and form a species of\r\nruins that are intimately associated with the recollections of colonial\r\nhistory, and which are in appropriate keeping with the gloomy character of the\r\nsurrounding scenery. The roof of bark had long since fallen, and mingled with\r\nthe soil, but the huge logs of pine, which had been hastily thrown together,\r\nstill preserved their relative positions, though one angle of the work had\r\ngiven way under the pressure, and threatened a speedy downfall to the remainder\r\nof the rustic edifice. While Heyward and his companions hesitated to approach a\r\nbuilding so decayed, Hawkeye and the Indians entered within the low walls, not\r\nonly without fear, but with obvious interest. While the former surveyed the\r\nruins, both internally and externally, with the curiosity of one whose\r\nrecollections were reviving at each moment, Chingachgook related to his son, in\r\nthe language of the Delawares, and with the pride of a conqueror, the brief\r\nhistory of the skirmish which had been fought, in his youth, in that secluded\r\nspot. A strain of melancholy, however, blended with his triumph, rendering his\r\nvoice, as usual, soft and musical.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the sisters gladly dismounted, and prepared to enjoy their\r\nhalt in the coolness of the evening, and in a security which they believed\r\nnothing but the beasts of the forest could invade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould not our resting-place have been more retired, my worthy\r\nfriend,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the more vigilant Duncan, perceiving that the scout had\r\nalready finished his short survey, \xe2\x80\x9chad we chosen a spot less known, and\r\none more rarely visited than this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFew live who know the blockhouse was ever raised,\xe2\x80\x9d was the slow\r\nand musing answer; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis not often that books are made, and\r\nnarratives written of such a scrimmage as was here fou\xe2\x80\x99t atween the\r\nMohicans and the Mohawks, in a war of their own waging. I was then a younker,\r\nand went out with the Delawares, because I know\xe2\x80\x99d they were a scandalized\r\nand wronged race. Forty days and forty nights did the imps crave our blood\r\naround this pile of logs, which I designed and partly reared, being, as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll remember, no Indian myself, but a man without a cross. The\r\nDelawares lent themselves to the work, and we made it good, ten to twenty,\r\nuntil our numbers were nearly equal, and then we sallied out upon the hounds,\r\nand not a man of them ever got back to tell the fate of his party. Yes, yes; I\r\nwas then young, and new to the sight of blood; and not relishing the thought\r\nthat creatures who had spirits like myself should lay on the naked ground, to\r\nbe torn asunder by beasts, or to bleach in the rains, I buried the dead with my\r\nown hands, under that very little hillock where you have placed yourselves; and\r\nno bad seat does it make neither, though it be raised by the bones of mortal\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward and the sisters arose, on the instant, from the grassy sepulcher; nor\r\ncould the two latter, notwithstanding the terrific scenes they had so recently\r\npassed through, entirely suppress an emotion of natural horror, when they found\r\nthemselves in such familiar contact with the grave of the dead Mohawks. The\r\ngray light, the gloomy little area of dark grass, surrounded by its border of\r\nbrush, beyond which the pines rose, in breathing silence, apparently into the\r\nvery clouds, and the deathlike stillness of the vast forest, were all in unison\r\nto deepen such a sensation. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are gone, and they are harmless,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Hawkeye, waving his hand, with a melancholy smile at their manifest\r\nalarm; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll never shout the war-whoop nor strike a blow with\r\nthe tomahawk again! And of all those who aided in placing them where they lie,\r\nChingachgook and I only are living! The brothers and family of the Mohican\r\nformed our war party; and you see before you all that are now left of his\r\nrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the listeners involuntarily sought the forms of the Indians, with a\r\ncompassionate interest in their desolate fortune. Their dark persons were still\r\nto be seen within the shadows of the blockhouse, the son listening to the\r\nrelation of his father with that sort of intenseness which would be created by\r\na narrative that redounded so much to the honor of those whose names he had\r\nlong revered for their courage and savage virtues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had thought the Delawares a pacific people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand that they never waged war in person; trusting the defense of their\r\nhands to those very Mohawks that you slew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis true in part,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet, at\r\nthe bottom, \xe2\x80\x99tis a wicked lie. Such a treaty was made in ages gone by,\r\nthrough the deviltries of the Dutchers, who wished to disarm the natives that\r\nhad the best right to the country, where they had settled themselves. The\r\nMohicans, though a part of the same nation, having to deal with the English,\r\nnever entered into the silly bargain, but kept to their manhood; as in truth\r\ndid the Delawares, when their eyes were open to their folly. You see before you\r\na chief of the great Mohican Sagamores! Once his family could chase their deer\r\nover tracts of country wider than that which belongs to the Albany Patteroon,\r\nwithout crossing brook or hill that was not their own; but what is left of\r\ntheir descendant? He may find his six feet of earth when God chooses, and keep\r\nit in peace, perhaps, if he has a friend who will take the pains to sink his\r\nhead so low that the plowshares cannot reach it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough!\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, apprehensive that the subject might lead to\r\na discussion that would interrupt the harmony so necessary to the preservation\r\nof his fair companions; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have journeyed far, and few among us are\r\nblessed with forms like that of yours, which seems to know neither fatigue nor\r\nweakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sinews and bones of a man carry me through it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nhunter, surveying his muscular limbs with a simplicity that betrayed the honest\r\npleasure the compliment afforded him; \xe2\x80\x9cthere are larger and heavier men\r\nto be found in the settlements, but you might travel many days in a city before\r\nyou could meet one able to walk fifty miles without stopping to take breath, or\r\nwho has kept the hounds within hearing during a chase of hours. However, as\r\nflesh and blood are not always the same, it is quite reasonable to suppose that\r\nthe gentle ones are willing to rest, after all they have seen and done this\r\nday. Uncas, clear out the spring, while your father and I make a cover for\r\ntheir tender heads of these chestnut shoots, and a bed of grass and\r\nleaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dialogue ceased, while the hunter and his companions busied themselves in\r\npreparations for the comfort and protection of those they guided. A spring,\r\nwhich many long years before had induced the natives to select the place for\r\ntheir temporary fortification, was soon cleared of leaves, and a fountain of\r\ncrystal gushed from the bed, diffusing its waters over the verdant hillock. A\r\ncorner of the building was then roofed in such a manner as to exclude the heavy\r\ndew of the climate, and piles of sweet shrubs and dried leaves were laid\r\nbeneath it for the sisters to repose on.\r\n\r\nWhile the diligent woodsmen were employed in this manner, Cora and Alice\r\npartook of that refreshment which duty required much more than inclination\r\nprompted them to accept. They then retired within the walls, and first offering\r\nup their thanksgivings for past mercies, and petitioning for a continuance of\r\nthe Divine favor throughout the coming night, they laid their tender forms on\r\nthe fragrant couch, and in spite of recollections and forebodings, soon sank\r\ninto those slumbers which nature so imperiously demanded, and which were\r\nsweetened by hopes for the morrow. Duncan had prepared himself to pass the\r\nnight in watchfulness near them, just without the ruin, but the scout,\r\nperceiving his intention, pointed toward Chingachgook, as he coolly disposed\r\nhis own person on the grass, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe eyes of a white man are too heavy and too blind for such a watch as\r\nthis! The Mohican will be our sentinel, therefore let us sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI proved myself a sluggard on my post during the past night,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHeyward, \xe2\x80\x9cand have less need of repose than you, who did more credit to\r\nthe character of a soldier. Let all the party seek their rest, then, while I\r\nhold the guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we lay among the white tents of the Sixtieth, and in front of an\r\nenemy like the French, I could not ask for a better watchman,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nthe scout; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in the darkness and among the signs of the wilderness\r\nyour judgment would be like the folly of a child, and your vigilance thrown\r\naway. Do then, like Uncas and myself, sleep, and sleep in safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward perceived, in truth, that the younger Indian had thrown his form on the\r\nside of the hillock while they were talking, like one who sought to make the\r\nmost of the time allotted to rest, and that his example had been followed by\r\nDavid, whose voice literally \xe2\x80\x9cclove to his jaws,\xe2\x80\x9d with the fever of\r\nhis wound, heightened, as it was, by their toilsome march. Unwilling to prolong\r\na useless discussion, the young man affected to comply, by posting his back\r\nagainst the logs of the blockhouse, in a half recumbent posture, though\r\nresolutely determined, in his own mind, not to close an eye until he had\r\ndelivered his precious charge into the arms of Munro himself. Hawkeye,\r\nbelieving he had prevailed, soon fell asleep, and a silence as deep as the\r\nsolitude in which they had found it, pervaded the retired spot.\r\n\r\nFor many minutes Duncan succeeded in keeping his senses on the alert, and alive\r\nto every moaning sound that arose from the forest. His vision became more acute\r\nas the shades of evening settled on the place; and even after the stars were\r\nglimmering above his head, he was able to distinguish the recumbent forms of\r\nhis companions, as they lay stretched on the grass, and to note the person of\r\nChingachgook, who sat upright and motionless as one of the trees which formed\r\nthe dark barrier on every side. He still heard the gentle breathings of the\r\nsisters, who lay within a few feet of him, and not a leaf was ruffled by the\r\npassing air of which his ear did not detect the whispering sound. At length,\r\nhowever, the mournful notes of a whip-poor-will became blended with the\r\nmoanings of an owl; his heavy eyes occasionally sought the bright rays of the\r\nstars, and he then fancied he saw them through the fallen lids. At instants of\r\nmomentary wakefulness he mistook a bush for his associate sentinel; his head\r\nnext sank upon his shoulder, which, in its turn, sought the support of the\r\nground; and, finally, his whole person became relaxed and pliant, and the young\r\nman sank into a deep sleep, dreaming that he was a knight of ancient chivalry,\r\nholding his midnight vigils before the tent of a recaptured princess, whose\r\nfavor he did not despair of gaining, by such a proof of devotion and\r\nwatchfulness.\r\n\r\nHow long the tired Duncan lay in this insensible state he never knew himself,\r\nbut his slumbering visions had been long lost in total forgetfulness, when he\r\nwas awakened by a light tap on the shoulder. Aroused by this signal, slight as\r\nit was, he sprang upon his feet with a confused recollection of the\r\nself-imposed duty he had assumed with the commencement of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho comes?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, feeling for his sword, at the place where\r\nit was usually suspended. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak! friend or enemy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the low voice of Chingachgook; who, pointing\r\nupward at the luminary which was shedding its mild light through the opening in\r\nthe trees, directly in their bivouac, immediately added, in his rude English:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoon comes and white man\xe2\x80\x99s fort far\xe2\x80\x94far off; time to move,\r\nwhen sleep shuts both eyes of the Frenchman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say true! Call up your friends, and bridle the horses while I\r\nprepare my own companions for the march!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are awake, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soft, silvery tones of Alice\r\nwithin the building, \xe2\x80\x9cand ready to travel very fast after so refreshing a\r\nsleep; but you have watched through the tedious night in our behalf, after\r\nhaving endured so much fatigue the livelong day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, rather, I would have watched, but my treacherous eyes betrayed me;\r\ntwice have I proved myself unfit for the trust I bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Duncan, deny it not,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the smiling Alice, issuing\r\nfrom the shadows of the building into the light of the moon, in all the\r\nloveliness of her freshened beauty; \xe2\x80\x9cI know you to be a heedless one,\r\nwhen self is the object of your care, and but too vigilant in favor of others.\r\nCan we not tarry here a little longer while you find the rest you need?\r\nCheerfully, most cheerfully, will Cora and I keep the vigils, while you and all\r\nthese brave men endeavor to snatch a little sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf shame could cure me of my drowsiness, I should never close an eye\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the uneasy youth, gazing at the ingenuous countenance of\r\nAlice, where, however, in its sweet solicitude, he read nothing to confirm his\r\nhalf-awakened suspicion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is but too true, that after leading you into\r\ndanger by my heedlessness, I have not even the merit of guarding your pillows\r\nas should become a soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one but Duncan himself should accuse Duncan of such a weakness. Go,\r\nthen, and sleep; believe me, neither of us, weak girls as we are, will betray\r\nour watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man was relieved from the awkwardness of making any further\r\nprotestations of his own demerits, by an exclamation from Chingachgook, and the\r\nattitude of riveted attention assumed by his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mohicans hear an enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Hawkeye, who, by this time,\r\nin common with the whole party, was awake and stirring. \xe2\x80\x9cThey scent\r\ndanger in the wind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Heyward. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely we have had enough\r\nof bloodshed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, however, the young soldier seized his rifle, and advancing\r\ntoward the front, prepared to atone for his venial remissness, by freely\r\nexposing his life in defense of those he attended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis some creature of the forest prowling around us in quest of\r\nfood,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a whisper, as soon as the low, and apparently distant\r\nsounds, which had startled the Mohicans, reached his own ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the attentive scout; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis man; even I\r\ncan now tell his tread, poor as my senses are when compared to an\r\nIndian\xe2\x80\x99s! That Scampering Huron has fallen in with one of\r\nMontcalm\xe2\x80\x99s outlying parties, and they have struck upon our trail. I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like, myself, to spill more human blood in this spot,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, looking around with anxiety in his features, at the dim objects by which\r\nhe was surrounded; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what must be, must! Lead the horses into the\r\nblockhouse, Uncas; and, friends, do you follow to the same shelter. Poor and\r\nold as it is, it offers a cover, and has rung with the crack of a rifle afore\r\nto-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was instantly obeyed, the Mohicans leading the Narrangansetts within the\r\nruin, whither the whole party repaired with the most guarded silence.\r\n\r\nThe sound of approaching footsteps were now too distinctly audible to leave any\r\ndoubts as to the nature of the interruption. They were soon mingled with voices\r\ncalling to each other in an Indian dialect, which the hunter, in a whisper,\r\naffirmed to Heyward was the language of the Hurons. When the party reached the\r\npoint where the horses had entered the thicket which surrounded the blockhouse,\r\nthey were evidently at fault, having lost those marks which, until that moment,\r\nhad directed their pursuit.\r\n\r\nIt would seem by the voices that twenty men were soon collected at that one\r\nspot, mingling their different opinions and advice in noisy clamor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe knaves know our weakness,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Hawkeye, who stood by the\r\nside of Heyward, in deep shade, looking through an opening in the logs,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t indulge their idleness in such a squaw\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarch. Listen to the reptiles! each man among them seems to have two tongues,\r\nand but a single leg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, brave as he was in the combat, could not, in such a moment of painful\r\nsuspense, make any reply to the cool and characteristic remark of the scout. He\r\nonly grasped his rifle more firmly, and fastened his eyes upon the narrow\r\nopening, through which he gazed upon the moonlight view with increasing\r\nanxiety. The deeper tones of one who spoke as having authority were next heard,\r\namid a silence that denoted the respect with which his orders, or rather\r\nadvice, was received. After which, by the rustling of leaves, and crackling of\r\ndried twigs, it was apparent the savages were separating in pursuit of the lost\r\ntrail. Fortunately for the pursued, the light of the moon, while it shed a\r\nflood of mild luster upon the little area around the ruin, was not sufficiently\r\nstrong to penetrate the deep arches of the forest, where the objects still lay\r\nin deceptive shadow. The search proved fruitless; for so short and sudden had\r\nbeen the passage from the faint path the travelers had journeyed into the\r\nthicket, that every trace of their footsteps was lost in the obscurity of the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before the restless savages were heard beating the\r\nbrush, and gradually approaching the inner edge of that dense border of young\r\nchestnuts which encircled the little area.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Heyward, endeavoring to thrust his\r\nrifle through the chink in the logs; \xe2\x80\x9clet us fire on their\r\napproach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep everything in the shade,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsnapping of a flint, or even the smell of a single karnel of the brimstone,\r\nwould bring the hungry varlets upon us in a body. Should it please God that we\r\nmust give battle for the scalps, trust to the experience of men who know the\r\nways of the savages, and who are not often backward when the war-whoop is\r\nhowled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan cast his eyes behind him, and saw that the trembling sisters were\r\ncowering in the far corner of the building, while the Mohicans stood in the\r\nshadow, like two upright posts, ready, and apparently willing, to strike when\r\nthe blow should be needed. Curbing his impatience, he again looked out upon the\r\narea, and awaited the result in silence. At that instant the thicket opened,\r\nand a tall and armed Huron advanced a few paces into the open space. As he\r\ngazed upon the silent blockhouse, the moon fell upon his swarthy countenance,\r\nand betrayed its surprise and curiosity. He made the exclamation which usually\r\naccompanies the former emotion in an Indian, and, calling in a low voice, soon\r\ndrew a companion to his side.\r\n\r\nThese children of the woods stood together for several moments pointing at the\r\ncrumbling edifice, and conversing in the unintelligible language of their\r\ntribe. They then approached, though with slow and cautious steps, pausing every\r\ninstant to look at the building, like startled deer whose curiosity struggled\r\npowerfully with their awakened apprehensions for the mastery. The foot of one\r\nof them suddenly rested on the mound, and he stopped to examine its nature. At\r\nthis moment, Heyward observed that the scout loosened his knife in its sheath,\r\nand lowered the muzzle of his rifle. Imitating these movements, the young man\r\nprepared himself for the struggle which now seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe savages were so near, that the least motion in one of the horses, or even a\r\nbreath louder than common, would have betrayed the fugitives. But in\r\ndiscovering the character of the mound, the attention of the Hurons appeared\r\ndirected to a different object. They spoke together, and the sounds of their\r\nvoices were low and solemn, as if influenced by a reverence that was deeply\r\nblended with awe. Then they drew warily back, keeping their eyes riveted on the\r\nruin, as if they expected to see the apparitions of the dead issue from its\r\nsilent walls, until, having reached the boundary of the area, they moved slowly\r\ninto the thicket and disappeared.\r\n\r\nHawkeye dropped the breech of his rifle to the earth, and drawing a long, free\r\nbreath, exclaimed, in an audible whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! they respect the dead, and it has this time saved their own lives,\r\nand, it may be, the lives of better men too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward lent his attention for a single moment to his companion, but without\r\nreplying, he again turned toward those who just then interested him more. He\r\nheard the two Hurons leave the bushes, and it was soon plain that all the\r\npursuers were gathered about them, in deep attention to their report. After a\r\nfew minutes of earnest and solemn dialogue, altogether different from the noisy\r\nclamor with which they had first collected about the spot, the sounds grew\r\nfainter and more distant, and finally were lost in the depths of the forest.\r\n\r\nHawkeye waited until a signal from the listening Chingachgook assured him that\r\nevery sound from the retiring party was completely swallowed by the distance,\r\nwhen he motioned to Heyward to lead forth the horses, and to assist the sisters\r\ninto their saddles. The instant this was done they issued through the broken\r\ngateway, and stealing out by a direction opposite to the one by which they\r\nentered, they quitted the spot, the sisters casting furtive glances at the\r\nsilent, grave and crumbling ruin, as they left the soft light of the moon, to\r\nbury themselves in the gloom of the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuard.\xe2\x80\x94Qui est la?\r\nPuc. \xe2\x80\x94Paisans, pauvres gens de France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94King Henry VI\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nThe scout resumed his post in the advance\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the rapid movement from the blockhouse, and until the party was deeply\r\nburied in the forest, each individual was too much interested in the escape to\r\nhazard a word even in whispers. The scout resumed his post in advance, though\r\nhis steps, after he had thrown a safe distance between himself and his enemies,\r\nwere more deliberate than in their previous march, in consequence of his utter\r\nignorance of the localities of the surrounding woods. More than once he halted\r\nto consult with his confederates, the Mohicans, pointing upward at the moon,\r\nand examining the barks of the trees with care. In these brief pauses, Heyward\r\nand the sisters listened, with senses rendered doubly acute by the danger, to\r\ndetect any symptoms which might announce the proximity of their foes. At such\r\nmoments, it seemed as if a vast range of country lay buried in eternal sleep;\r\nnot the least sound arising from the forest, unless it was the distant and\r\nscarcely audible rippling of a water-course. Birds, beasts, and man, appeared\r\nto slumber alike, if, indeed, any of the latter were to be found in that wide\r\ntract of wilderness. But the sounds of the rivulet, feeble and murmuring as\r\nthey were, relieved the guides at once from no trifling embarrassment, and\r\ntoward it they immediately held their way.\r\n\r\nWhen the banks of the little stream were gained, Hawkeye made another halt; and\r\ntaking the moccasins from his feet, he invited Heyward and Gamut to follow his\r\nexample. He then entered the water, and for near an hour they traveled in the\r\nbed of the brook, leaving no trail. The moon had already sunk into an immense\r\npile of black clouds, which lay impending above the western horizon, when they\r\nissued from the low and devious water-course to rise again to the light and\r\nlevel of the sandy but wooded plain. Here the scout seemed to be once more at\r\nhome, for he held on this way with the certainty and diligence of a man who\r\nmoved in the security of his own knowledge. The path soon became more uneven,\r\nand the travelers could plainly perceive that the mountains drew nigher to them\r\non each hand, and that they were, in truth, about entering one of their gorges.\r\nSuddenly, Hawkeye made a pause, and, waiting until he was joined by the whole\r\nparty, he spoke, though in tones so low and cautious, that they added to the\r\nsolemnity of his words, in the quiet and darkness of the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to know the pathways, and to find the licks and water-courses\r\nof the wilderness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut who that saw this spot could\r\nventure to say, that a mighty army was at rest among yonder silent trees and\r\nbarren mountains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are, then, at no great distance from William Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHeyward, advancing nigher to the scout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is yet a long and weary path, and when and where to strike it is now\r\nour greatest difficulty. See,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing through the trees toward\r\na spot where a little basin of water reflected the stars from its placid bosom,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere is the \xe2\x80\x98bloody pond\xe2\x80\x99; and I am on ground that I have\r\nnot only often traveled, but over which I have fou\xe2\x80\x99t the enemy, from the\r\nrising to the setting sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! that sheet of dull and dreary water, then, is the sepulcher of the\r\nbrave men who fell in the contest. I have heard it named, but never have I\r\nstood on its banks before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree battles did we make with the Dutch-Frenchman[1]\r\nin a day,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hawkeye, pursuing the train of his own thoughts,\r\nrather than replying to the remark of Duncan. \xe2\x80\x9cHe met us hard by, in our\r\noutward march to ambush his advance, and scattered us, like driven deer,\r\nthrough the defile, to the shores of Horican. Then we rallied behind our fallen\r\ntrees, and made head against him, under Sir William\xe2\x80\x94who was made Sir\r\nWilliam for that very deed; and well did we pay him for the disgrace of the\r\nmorning! Hundreds of Frenchmen saw the sun that day for the last time; and even\r\ntheir leader, Dieskau himself, fell into our hands, so cut and torn with the\r\nlead, that he has gone back to his own country, unfit for further acts in\r\nwar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nBaron Dieskau, a German, in the service of France. A few years previously to\r\nthe period of the tale, this officer was defeated by Sir William Johnson, of\r\nJohnstown, New York, on the shores of Lake George.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas a noble repulse!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Heyward, in the heat of\r\nhis youthful ardor; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fame of it reached us early, in our southern\r\narmy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! but it did not end there. I was sent by Major Effingham, at Sir\r\nWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s own bidding, to outflank the French, and carry the tidings of\r\ntheir disaster across the portage, to the fort on the Hudson. Just hereaway,\r\nwhere you see the trees rise into a mountain swell, I met a party coming down\r\nto our aid, and I led them where the enemy were taking their meal, little\r\ndreaming that they had not finished the bloody work of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you surprised them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf death can be a surprise to men who are thinking only of the cravings\r\nof their appetites. We gave them but little breathing time, for they had borne\r\nhard upon us in the fight of the morning, and there were few in our party who\r\nhad not lost friend or relative by their hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen all was over, the dead, and some say the dying, were cast into that\r\nlittle pond. These eyes have seen its waters colored with blood, as natural\r\nwater never yet flowed from the bowels of the \xe2\x80\x99arth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a convenient, and, I trust, will prove a peaceful grave for a\r\nsoldier. You have then seen much service on this frontier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, erecting his tall person with an air of\r\nmilitary pride; \xe2\x80\x9cthere are not many echoes among these hills that\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t rung with the crack of my rifle, nor is there the space of a\r\nsquare mile atwixt Horican and the river, that \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t dropped a living body on, be it an enemy or be it a brute beast.\r\nAs for the grave there being as quiet as you mention, it is another matter.\r\nThere are them in the camp who say and think, man, to lie still, should not be\r\nburied while the breath is in the body; and certain it is that in the hurry of\r\nthat evening, the doctors had but little time to say who was living and who was\r\ndead. Hist! see you nothing walking on the shore of the pond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis not probable that any are as houseless as ourselves in this\r\ndreary forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch as he may care but little for house or shelter, and night dew can\r\nnever wet a body that passes its days in the water,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout,\r\ngrasping the shoulder of Heyward with such convulsive strength as to make the\r\nyoung soldier painfully sensible how much superstitious terror had got the\r\nmastery of a man usually so dauntless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy heaven, there is a human form, and it approaches! Stand to your arms,\r\nmy friends; for we know not whom we encounter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQui vive?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded a stern, quick voice, which sounded like a\r\nchallenge from another world, issuing out of that solitary and solemn place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat says it?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cit speaks neither\r\nIndian nor English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQui vive?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the same voice, which was quickly followed by\r\nthe rattling of arms, and a menacing attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrance!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Heyward, advancing from the shadow of the trees to\r\nthe shore of the pond, within a few yards of the sentinel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ou venez-vous\xe2\x80\x94ou allez-vous, d\xe2\x80\x99aussi bonne\r\nheure?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the grenadier, in the language and with the accent of a\r\nman from old France.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe viens de la d\xc3\xa9couverte, et je vais me coucher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEtes-vous officier du roi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSans doute, mon camarade; me prends-tu pour un provincial! Je suis\r\ncapitaine de chasseurs (Heyward well knew that the other was of a regiment in\r\nthe line); j\xe2\x80\x99ai ici, avec moi, les filles du commandant de la\r\nfortification. Aha! tu en as entendu parler! je les ai fait prisonni\xc3\xa8res pr\xc3\xa8s\r\nde l\xe2\x80\x99autre fort, et je les conduis au g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa foi! mesdames; j\xe2\x80\x99en suis fach\xc3\xa9 pour vous,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nyoung soldier, touching his cap with grace; \xe2\x80\x9cmais\xe2\x80\x94fortune de\r\nguerre! vous trouverez notre g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral un brave homme, et bien poli avec les\r\ndames.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est le caractere des gens de guerre,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora, with\r\nadmirable self-possession. \xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, mon ami; je vous souhaiterais un\r\ndevoir plus agr\xc3\xa9able a remplir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier made a low and humble acknowledgment for her civility; and Heyward\r\nadding a \xe2\x80\x9cBonne nuit, mon camarade,\xe2\x80\x9d they moved deliberately\r\nforward, leaving the sentinel pacing the banks of the silent pond, little\r\nsuspecting an enemy of so much effrontery, and humming to himself those words\r\nwhich were recalled to his mind by the sight of women, and, perhaps, by\r\nrecollections of his own distant and beautiful France:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVive le vin, vive l\xe2\x80\x99amour,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well you understood the knave!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the scout,\r\nwhen they had gained a little distance from the place, and letting his rifle\r\nfall into the hollow of his arm again; \xe2\x80\x9cI soon saw that he was one of\r\nthem uneasy Frenchers; and well for him it was that his speech was friendly and\r\nhis wishes kind, or a place might have been found for his bones among those of\r\nhis countrymen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a long and heavy groan which arose from the little basin,\r\nas though, in truth, the spirits of the departed lingered about their watery\r\nsepulcher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely it was of flesh,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cno spirit\r\ncould handle its arms so steadily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_ of flesh; but whether the poor fellow still belongs to\r\nthis world may well be doubted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, glancing his eyes around\r\nhim, and missing Chingachgook from their little band. Another groan more faint\r\nthan the former was succeeded by a heavy and sullen plunge into the water, and\r\nall was still again as if the borders of the dreary pool had never been\r\nawakened from the silence of creation. While they yet hesitated in uncertainty,\r\nthe form of the Indian was seen gliding out of the thicket. As the chief\r\nrejoined them, with one hand he attached the reeking scalp of the unfortunate\r\nyoung Frenchman to his girdle, and with the other he replaced the knife and\r\ntomahawk that had drunk his blood. He then took his wonted station, with the\r\nair of a man who believed he had done a deed of merit.\r\n\r\nThe scout dropped one end of his rifle to the earth, and leaning his hands on\r\nthe other, he stood musing in profound silence. Then, shaking his head in a\r\nmournful manner, he muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould have been a cruel and an unhuman act for a white-skin; but\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis the gift and natur\xe2\x80\x99 of an Indian, and I suppose it should not\r\nbe denied. I could wish, though, it had befallen an accursed Mingo, rather than\r\nthat gay young boy from the old countries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough!\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, apprehensive the unconscious sisters might\r\ncomprehend the nature of the detention, and conquering his disgust by a train\r\nof reflections very much like that of the hunter; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis done; and\r\nthough better it were left undone, cannot be amended. You see, we are, too\r\nobviously within the sentinels of the enemy; what course do you propose to\r\nfollow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, rousing himself again; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis as\r\nyou say, too late to harbor further thoughts about it. Ay, the French have\r\ngathered around the fort in good earnest and we have a delicate needle to\r\nthread in passing them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd but little time to do it in,\xe2\x80\x9d added Heyward, glancing his eyes\r\nupwards, toward the bank of vapor that concealed the setting moon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd little time to do it in!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing\r\nmay be done in two fashions, by the help of Providence, without which it may\r\nnot be done at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName them quickly for time presses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would be to dismount the gentle ones, and let their beasts range the\r\nplain, by sending the Mohicans in front, we might then cut a lane through their\r\nsentries, and enter the fort over the dead bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not do\xe2\x80\x94it will not do!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the generous\r\nHeyward; \xe2\x80\x9ca soldier might force his way in this manner, but never with\r\nsuch a convoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould be, indeed, a bloody path for such tender feet to wade\r\nin,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the equally reluctant scout; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I thought it\r\nbefitting my manhood to name it. We must, then, turn in our trail and get\r\nwithout the line of their lookouts, when we will bend short to the west, and\r\nenter the mountains; where I can hide you, so that all the devil\xe2\x80\x99s hounds\r\nin Montcalm\xe2\x80\x99s pay would be thrown off the scent for months to\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be done, and that instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFurther words were unnecessary; for Hawkeye, merely uttering the mandate to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfollow,\xe2\x80\x9d moved along the route by which they had just entered\r\ntheir present critical and even dangerous situation. Their progress, like their\r\nlate dialogue, was guarded, and without noise; for none knew at what moment a\r\npassing patrol, or a crouching picket of the enemy, might rise upon their path.\r\nAs they held their silent way along the margin of the pond, again Heyward and\r\nthe scout stole furtive glances at its appalling dreariness. They looked in\r\nvain for the form they had so recently seen stalking along in silent shores,\r\nwhile a low and regular wash of the little waves, by announcing that the waters\r\nwere not yet subsided, furnished a frightful memorial of the deed of blood they\r\nhad just witnessed. Like all that passing and gloomy scene, the low basin,\r\nhowever, quickly melted in the darkness, and became blended with the mass of\r\nblack objects in the rear of the travelers.\r\n\r\nHawkeye soon deviated from the line of their retreat, and striking off towards\r\nthe mountains which form the western boundary of the narrow plain, he led his\r\nfollowers, with swift steps, deep within the shadows that were cast from their\r\nhigh and broken summits. The route was now painful; lying over ground ragged\r\nwith rocks, and intersected with ravines, and their progress proportionately\r\nslow. Bleak and black hills lay on every side of them, compensating in some\r\ndegree for the additional toil of the march by the sense of security they\r\nimparted. At length the party began slowly to rise a steep and rugged ascent,\r\nby a path that curiously wound among rocks and trees, avoiding the one and\r\nsupported by the other, in a manner that showed it had been devised by men long\r\npractised in the arts of the wilderness. As they gradually rose from the level\r\nof the valleys, the thick darkness which usually precedes the approach of day\r\nbegan to disperse, and objects were seen in the plain and palpable colors with\r\nwhich they had been gifted by nature. When they issued from the stunted woods\r\nwhich clung to the barren sides of the mountain, upon a flat and mossy rock\r\nthat formed its summit, they met the morning, as it came blushing above the\r\ngreen pines of a hill that lay on the opposite side of the valley of the\r\nHorican.\r\n\r\nThe scout now told the sisters to dismount; and taking the bridles from the\r\nmouths, and the saddles off the backs of the jaded beasts, he turned them\r\nloose, to glean a scanty subsistence among the shrubs and meager herbage of\r\nthat elevated region.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand seek your food where natur\xe2\x80\x99 gives\r\nit to you; and beware that you become not food to ravenous wolves yourselves,\r\namong these hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave we no further need of them?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, and judge with your own eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, advancing\r\ntoward the eastern brow of the mountain, whither he beckoned for the whole\r\nparty to follow; \xe2\x80\x9cif it was as easy to look into the heart of man as it\r\nis to spy out the nakedness of Montcalm\xe2\x80\x99s camp from this spot, hypocrites\r\nwould grow scarce, and the cunning of a Mingo might prove a losing game,\r\ncompared to the honesty of a Delaware.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the travelers reached the verge of the precipices they saw, at a glance,\r\nthe truth of the scout\xe2\x80\x99s declaration, and the admirable foresight with\r\nwhich he had led them to their commanding station.\r\n\r\nThe mountain on which they stood, elevated perhaps a thousand feet in the air,\r\nwas a high cone that rose a little in advance of that range which stretches for\r\nmiles along the western shores of the lake, until meeting its sisters miles\r\nbeyond the water, it ran off toward the Canadas, in confused and broken masses\r\nof rock, thinly sprinkled with evergreens. Immediately at the feet of the\r\nparty, the southern shore of the Horican swept in a broad semicircle from\r\nmountain to mountain, marking a wide strand, that soon rose into an uneven and\r\nsomewhat elevated plain. To the north stretched the limpid, and, as it appeared\r\nfrom that dizzy height, the narrow sheet of the \xe2\x80\x9choly lake,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nindented with numberless bays, embellished by fantastic headlands, and dotted\r\nwith countless islands. At the distance of a few leagues, the bed of the water\r\nbecame lost among mountains, or was wrapped in the masses of vapor that came\r\nslowly rolling along their bosom, before a light morning air. But a narrow\r\nopening between the crests of the hills pointed out the passage by which they\r\nfound their way still further north, to spread their pure and ample sheets\r\nagain, before pouring out their tribute into the distant Champlain. To the\r\nsouth stretched the defile, or rather broken plain, so often mentioned. For\r\nseveral miles in this direction, the mountains appeared reluctant to yield\r\ntheir dominion, but within reach of the eye they diverged, and finally melted\r\ninto the level and sandy lands, across which we have accompanied our\r\nadventurers in their double journey. Along both ranges of hills, which bounded\r\nthe opposite sides of the lake and valley, clouds of light vapor were rising in\r\nspiral wreaths from the uninhabited woods, looking like the smoke of hidden\r\ncottages; or rolled lazily down the declivities, to mingle with the fogs of the\r\nlower land. A single, solitary, snow-white cloud floated above the valley, and\r\nmarked the spot beneath which lay the silent pool of the \xe2\x80\x9cbloody\r\npond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirectly on the shore of the lake, and nearer to its western than to its\r\neastern margin, lay the extensive earthen ramparts and low buildings of William\r\nHenry. Two of the sweeping bastions appeared to rest on the water which washed\r\ntheir bases, while a deep ditch and extensive morasses guarded its other sides\r\nand angles. The land had been cleared of wood for a reasonable distance around\r\nthe work, but every other part of the scene lay in the green livery of nature,\r\nexcept where the limpid water mellowed the view, or the bold rocks thrust their\r\nblack and naked heads above the undulating outline of the mountain ranges. In\r\nits front might be seen the scattered sentinels, who held a weary watch against\r\ntheir numerous foes; and within the walls themselves, the travelers looked down\r\nupon men still drowsy with a night of vigilance. Toward the southeast, but in\r\nimmediate contact with the fort, was an entrenched camp, posted on a rocky\r\neminence, that would have been far more eligible for the work itself, in which\r\nHawkeye pointed out the presence of those auxiliary regiments that had so\r\nrecently left the Hudson in their company. From the woods, a little further to\r\nthe south, rose numerous dark and lurid smokes, that were easily to be\r\ndistinguished from the purer exhalations of the springs, and which the scout\r\nalso showed to Heyward, as evidences that the enemy lay in force in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBut the spectacle which most concerned the young soldier was on the western\r\nbank of the lake, though quite near to its southern termination. On a strip of\r\nland, which appeared from his stand too narrow to contain such an army, but\r\nwhich, in truth, extended many hundreds of yards from the shores of the Horican\r\nto the base of the mountain, were to be seen the white tents and military\r\nengines of an encampment of ten thousand men. Batteries were already thrown up\r\nin their front, and even while the spectators above them were looking down,\r\nwith such different emotions, on a scene which lay like a map beneath their\r\nfeet, the roar of artillery rose from the valley, and passed off in thundering\r\nechoes along the eastern hills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning is just touching them below,\xe2\x80\x9d said the deliberate and\r\nmusing scout, \xe2\x80\x9cand the watchers have a mind to wake up the sleepers by\r\nthe sound of cannon. We are a few hours too late! Montcalm has already filled\r\nthe woods with his accursed Iroquois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place is, indeed, invested,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut is\r\nthere no expedient by which we may enter? capture in the works would be far\r\npreferable to falling again into the hands of roving Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the scout, unconsciously directing the attention\r\nof Cora to the quarters of her own father, \xe2\x80\x9chow that shot has made the\r\nstones fly from the side of the commandant\xe2\x80\x99s house! Ay! these Frenchers\r\nwill pull it to pieces faster than it was put together, solid and thick though\r\nit be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyward, I sicken at the sight of danger that I cannot share,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the undaunted but anxious daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to Montcalm, and\r\ndemand admission: he dare not deny a child the boon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would scarce find the tent of the Frenchman with the hair on your\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x9d; said the blunt scout. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had but one of the thousand\r\nboats which lie empty along that shore, it might be done! Ha! here will soon be\r\nan end of the firing, for yonder comes a fog that will turn day to night, and\r\nmake an Indian arrow more dangerous than a molded cannon. Now, if you are equal\r\nto the work, and will follow, I will make a push; for I long to get down into\r\nthat camp, if it be only to scatter some Mingo dogs that I see lurking in the\r\nskirts of yonder thicket of birch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are equal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora, firmly; \xe2\x80\x9con such an errand we will\r\nfollow to any danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout turned to her with a smile of honest and cordial approbation, as he\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would I had a thousand men, of brawny limbs and quick eyes, that\r\nfeared death as little as you! I\xe2\x80\x99d send them jabbering Frenchers back\r\ninto their den again, afore the week was ended, howling like so many fettered\r\nhounds or hungry wolves. But, stir,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning from her to the\r\nrest of the party, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fog comes rolling down so fast, we shall have but\r\njust the time to meet it on the plain, and use it as a cover. Remember, if any\r\naccident should befall me, to keep the air blowing on your left\r\ncheeks\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, follow the Mohicans; they\xe2\x80\x99d scent their way, be\r\nit in day or be it at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then waved his hand for them to follow, and threw himself down the steep\r\ndeclivity, with free, but careful footsteps. Heyward assisted the sisters to\r\ndescend, and in a few minutes they were all far down a mountain whose sides\r\nthey had climbed with so much toil and pain.\r\n\r\nThe direction taken by Hawkeye soon brought the travelers to the level of the\r\nplain, nearly opposite to a sally-port in the western curtain of the fort,\r\nwhich lay itself at the distance of about half a mile from the point where he\r\nhalted to allow Duncan to come up with his charge. In their eagerness, and\r\nfavored by the nature of the ground, they had anticipated the fog, which was\r\nrolling heavily down the lake, and it became necessary to pause, until the\r\nmists had wrapped the camp of the enemy in their fleecy mantle. The Mohicans\r\nprofited by the delay, to steal out of the woods, and to make a survey of\r\nsurrounding objects. They were followed at a little distance by the scout, with\r\na view to profit early by their report, and to obtain some faint knowledge for\r\nhimself of the more immediate localities.\r\n\r\nIn a very few moments he returned, his face reddened with vexation, while he\r\nmuttered his disappointment in words of no very gentle import.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere has the cunning Frenchman been posting a picket directly in our\r\npath,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cred-skins and whites; and we shall be as likely to\r\nfall into their midst as to pass them in the fog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCannot we make a circuit to avoid the danger,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Heyward,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand come into our path again when it is passed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho that once bends from the line of his march in a fog can tell when or\r\nhow to find it again! The mists of Horican are not like the curls from a\r\npeace-pipe, or the smoke which settles above a mosquito fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was yet speaking, when a crashing sound was heard, and a cannon-ball entered\r\nthe thicket, striking the body of a sapling, and rebounding to the earth, its\r\nforce being much expended by previous resistance. The Indians followed\r\ninstantly like busy attendants on the terrible messenger, and Uncas commenced\r\nspeaking earnestly and with much action, in the Delaware tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the scout, when he had ended;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor desperate fevers are not to be treated like a toothache. Come, then,\r\nthe fog is shutting in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cfirst explain your\r\nexpectations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis soon done, and a small hope it is; but it is better than\r\nnothing. This shot that you see,\xe2\x80\x9d added the scout, kicking the harmless\r\niron with his foot, \xe2\x80\x9chas plowed the \xe2\x80\x99arth in its road from the\r\nfort, and we shall hunt for the furrow it has made, when all other signs may\r\nfail. No more words, but follow, or the fog may leave us in the middle of our\r\npath, a mark for both armies to shoot at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward perceiving that, in fact, a crisis had arrived, when acts were more\r\nrequired than words, placed himself between the sisters, and drew them swiftly\r\nforward, keeping the dim figure of their leader in his eye. It was soon\r\napparent that Hawkeye had not magnified the power of the fog, for before they\r\nhad proceeded twenty yards, it was difficult for the different individuals of\r\nthe party to distinguish each other in the vapor.\r\n\r\nThey had made their little circuit to the left, and were already inclining\r\nagain toward the right, having, as Heyward thought, got over nearly half the\r\ndistance to the friendly works, when his ears were saluted with the fierce\r\nsummons, apparently within twenty feet of them, of:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQui va l\xc3\xa0?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPush on!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the scout, once more bending to the left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPush on!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Heyward; when the summons was renewed by a\r\ndozen voices, each of which seemed charged with menace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est moi,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Duncan, dragging rather than leading those\r\nhe supported swiftly onward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xc3\xaate!\xe2\x80\x94qui?\xe2\x80\x94moi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmi de la France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTu m\xe2\x80\x99as plus l\xe2\x80\x99air d\xe2\x80\x99un _ennemi_ de la France;\r\narrete ou pardieu je te ferai ami du diable. Non! feu, camarades, feu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe order was instantly obeyed, and the fog was stirred by the explosion of\r\nfifty muskets. Happily, the aim was bad, and the bullets cut the air in a\r\ndirection a little different from that taken by the fugitives; though still so\r\nnigh them, that to the unpractised ears of David and the two females, it\r\nappeared as if they whistled within a few inches of the organs. The outcry was\r\nrenewed, and the order, not only to fire again, but to pursue, was too plainly\r\naudible. When Heyward briefly explained the meaning of the words they heard,\r\nHawkeye halted and spoke with quick decision and great firmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us deliver our fire,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey will believe it a\r\nsortie, and give way, or they will wait for reinforcements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scheme was well conceived, but failed in its effects. The instant the\r\nFrench heard the pieces, it seemed as if the plain was alive with men, muskets\r\nrattling along its whole extent, from the shores of the lake to the furthest\r\nboundary of the woods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall draw their entire army upon us, and bring on a general\r\nassault,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan: \xe2\x80\x9clead on, my friend, for your own life and\r\nours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout seemed willing to comply; but, in the hurry of the moment, and in the\r\nchange of position, he had lost the direction. In vain he turned either cheek\r\ntoward the light air; they felt equally cool. In this dilemma, Uncas lighted on\r\nthe furrow of the cannon ball, where it had cut the ground in three adjacent\r\nant-hills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the range!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, bending to catch a glimpse of\r\nthe direction, and then instantly moving onward.\r\n\r\nCries, oaths, voices calling to each other, and the reports of muskets, were\r\nnow quick and incessant, and, apparently, on every side of them. Suddenly a\r\nstrong glare of light flashed across the scene, the fog rolled upward in thick\r\nwreaths, and several cannons belched across the plain, and the roar was thrown\r\nheavily back from the bellowing echoes of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis from the fort!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hawkeye, turning short on his\r\ntracks; \xe2\x80\x9cand we, like stricken fools, were rushing to the woods, under\r\nthe very knives of the Maquas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant their mistake was rectified, the whole party retraced the error\r\nwith the utmost diligence. Duncan willingly relinquished the support of Cora to\r\nthe arm of Uncas and Cora as readily accepted the welcome assistance. Men, hot\r\nand angry in pursuit, were evidently on their footsteps, and each instant\r\nthreatened their capture, if not their destruction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoint de quartier aux coquins!\xe2\x80\x9d cried an eager pursuer, who seemed\r\nto direct the operations of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand firm, and be ready, my gallant Sixtieths!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly\r\nexclaimed a voice above them; \xe2\x80\x9cwait to see the enemy, fire low and sweep\r\nthe glacis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather! father!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is I! Alice! thy own Elsie! Spare, oh! save your daughters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the former speaker, in the awful tones of parental\r\nagony, the sound reaching even to the woods, and rolling back in solemn echo.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis she! God has restored me to my children! Throw open the\r\nsally-port; to the field, Sixtieths, to the field; pull not a trigger, lest ye\r\nkill my lambs! Drive off these dogs of France with your steel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan heard the grating of the rusty hinges, and darting to the spot, directed\r\nby the sound, he met a long line of dark red warriors, passing swiftly toward\r\nthe glacis. He knew them for his own battalion of the Royal Americans, and\r\nflying to their head, soon swept every trace of his pursuers from before the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nFor an instant, Cora and Alice had stood trembling and bewildered by this\r\nunexpected desertion; but before either had leisure for speech, or even\r\nthought, an officer of gigantic frame, whose locks were bleached with years and\r\nservice, but whose air of military grandeur had been rather softened than\r\ndestroyed by time, rushed out of the body of mist, and folded them to his\r\nbosom, while large scalding tears rolled down his pale and wrinkled cheeks, and\r\nhe exclaimed, in the peculiar accent of Scotland:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor this I thank thee, Lord! Let danger come as it will, thy servant is\r\nnow prepared!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go we in, to know his embassy;\r\nWhich I could, with ready guess, declare,\r\nBefore the Frenchmen speak a word of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94King Henry V\r\n\r\n\r\nA few succeeding days were passed amid the privations, the uproar, and the\r\ndangers of the siege, which was vigorously pressed by a power, against whose\r\napproaches Munro possessed no competent means of resistance. It appeared as if\r\nWebb, with his army, which lay slumbering on the banks of the Hudson, had\r\nutterly forgotten the strait to which his countrymen were reduced. Montcalm had\r\nfilled the woods of the portage with his savages, every yell and whoop from\r\nwhom rang through the British encampment, chilling the hearts of men who were\r\nalready but too much disposed to magnify the danger.\r\n\r\nNot so, however, with the besieged. Animated by the words, and stimulated by\r\nthe examples of their leaders, they had found their courage, and maintained\r\ntheir ancient reputation, with a zeal that did justice to the stern character\r\nof their commander. As if satisfied with the toil of marching through the\r\nwilderness to encounter his enemy, the French general, though of approved\r\nskill, had neglected to seize the adjacent mountains; whence the besieged might\r\nhave been exterminated with impunity, and which, in the more modern warfare of\r\nthe country, would not have been neglected for a single hour. This sort of\r\ncontempt for eminences, or rather dread of the labor of ascending them, might\r\nhave been termed the besetting weakness of the warfare of the period. It\r\noriginated in the simplicity of the Indian contests, in which, from the nature\r\nof the combats, and the density of the forests, fortresses were rare, and\r\nartillery next to useless. The carelessness engendered by these usages\r\ndescended even to the war of the Revolution and lost the States the important\r\nfortress of Ticonderoga opening a way for the army of Burgoyne into what was\r\nthen the bosom of the country. We look back at this ignorance, or infatuation,\r\nwhichever it may be called, with wonder, knowing that the neglect of an\r\neminence, whose difficulties, like those of Mount Defiance, have been so\r\ngreatly exaggerated, would, at the present time, prove fatal to the reputation\r\nof the engineer who had planned the works at their base, or to that of the\r\ngeneral whose lot it was to defend them.\r\n\r\nThe tourist, the valetudinarian, or the amateur of the beauties of nature, who,\r\nin the train of his four-in-hand, now rolls through the scenes we have\r\nattempted to describe, in quest of information, health, or pleasure, or floats\r\nsteadily toward his object on those artificial waters which have sprung up\r\nunder the administration of a statesman[1]\r\nwho has dared to stake his political character on the hazardous issue, is not\r\nto suppose that his ancestors traversed those hills, or struggled with the same\r\ncurrents with equal facility. The transportation of a single heavy gun was\r\noften considered equal to a victory gained; if happily, the difficulties of the\r\npassage had not so far separated it from its necessary concomitant, the\r\nammunition, as to render it no more than a useless tube of unwieldy iron.\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nEvidently the late De Witt Clinton, who died governor of New York in 1828.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evils of this state of things pressed heavily on the fortunes of the\r\nresolute Scotsman who now defended William Henry. Though his adversary\r\nneglected the hills, he had planted his batteries with judgment on the plain,\r\nand caused them to be served with vigor and skill. Against this assault, the\r\nbesieged could only oppose the imperfect and hasty preparations of a fortress\r\nin the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIt was in the afternoon of the fifth day of the siege, and the fourth of his\r\nown service in it, that Major Heyward profited by a parley that had just been\r\nbeaten, by repairing to the ramparts of one of the water bastions, to breathe\r\nthe cool air from the lake, and to take a survey of the progress of the siege.\r\nHe was alone, if the solitary sentinel who paced the mound be excepted; for the\r\nartillerists had hastened also to profit by the temporary suspension of their\r\narduous duties. The evening was delightfully calm, and the light air from the\r\nlimpid water fresh and soothing. It seemed as if, with the termination of the\r\nroar of artillery and the plunging of shot, nature had also seized the moment\r\nto assume her mildest and most captivating form. The sun poured down his\r\nparting glory on the scene, without the oppression of those fierce rays that\r\nbelong to the climate and the season. The mountains looked green, and fresh,\r\nand lovely, tempered with the milder light, or softened in shadow, as thin\r\nvapors floated between them and the sun. The numerous islands rested on the\r\nbosom of the Horican, some low and sunken, as if embedded in the waters, and\r\nothers appearing to hover about the element, in little hillocks of green\r\nvelvet; among which the fishermen of the beleaguering army peacefully rowed\r\ntheir skiffs, or floated at rest on the glassy mirror in quiet pursuit of their\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nThe scene was at once animated and still. All that pertained to nature was\r\nsweet, or simply grand; while those parts which depended on the temper and\r\nmovements of man were lively and playful.\r\n\r\nTwo little spotless flags were abroad, the one on a salient angle of the fort,\r\nand the other on the advanced battery of the besiegers; emblems of the truth\r\nwhich existed, not only to the acts, but it would seem, also, to the enmity of\r\nthe combatants.\r\n\r\nBehind these again swung, heavily opening and closing in silken folds, the\r\nrival standards of England and France.\r\n\r\nA hundred gay and thoughtless young Frenchmen were drawing a net to the pebbly\r\nbeach, within dangerous proximity to the sullen but silent cannon of the fort,\r\nwhile the eastern mountain was sending back the loud shouts and gay merriment\r\nthat attended their sport. Some were rushing eagerly to enjoy the aquatic games\r\nof the lake, and others were already toiling their way up the neighboring\r\nhills, with the restless curiosity of their nation. To all these sports and\r\npursuits, those of the enemy who watched the besieged, and the besieged\r\nthemselves, were, however, merely the idle though sympathizing spectators. Here\r\nand there a picket had, indeed, raised a song, or mingled in a dance, which had\r\ndrawn the dusky savages around them, from their lairs in the forest. In short,\r\neverything wore rather the appearance of a day of pleasure, than of an hour\r\nstolen from the dangers and toil of a bloody and vindictive warfare.\r\n\r\nDuncan had stood in a musing attitude, contemplating this scene a few minutes,\r\nwhen his eyes were directed to the glacis in front of the sally-port already\r\nmentioned, by the sounds of approaching footsteps. He walked to an angle of the\r\nbastion, and beheld the scout advancing, under the custody of a French officer,\r\nto the body of the fort. The countenance of Hawkeye was haggard and careworn,\r\nand his air dejected, as though he felt the deepest degradation at having\r\nfallen into the power of his enemies. He was without his favorite weapon, and\r\nhis arms were even bound behind him with thongs, made of the skin of a deer.\r\nThe arrival of flags to cover the messengers of summons, had occurred so often\r\nof late, that when Heyward first threw his careless glance on this group, he\r\nexpected to see another of the officers of the enemy, charged with a similar\r\noffice but the instant he recognized the tall person and still sturdy though\r\ndowncast features of his friend, the woodsman, he started with surprise, and\r\nturned to descend from the bastion into the bosom of the work.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of other voices, however, caught his attention, and for a moment\r\ncaused him to forget his purpose. At the inner angle of the mound he met the\r\nsisters, walking along the parapet, in search, like himself, of air and relief\r\nfrom confinement. They had not met from that painful moment when he deserted\r\nthem on the plain, only to assure their safety. He had parted from them worn\r\nwith care, and jaded with fatigue; he now saw them refreshed and blooming,\r\nthough timid and anxious. Under such an inducement it will cause no surprise\r\nthat the young man lost sight for a time, of other objects in order to address\r\nthem. He was, however, anticipated by the voice of the ingenuous and youthful\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! thou tyrant! thou recreant knight! he who abandons his damsels in\r\nthe very lists,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried; \xe2\x80\x9chere have we been days, nay, ages,\r\nexpecting you at our feet, imploring mercy and forgetfulness of your craven\r\nbacksliding, or I should rather say, backrunning\xe2\x80\x94for verily you fled in\r\nthe manner that no stricken deer, as our worthy friend the scout would say,\r\ncould equal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that Alice means our thanks and our blessings,\xe2\x80\x9d added the\r\ngraver and more thoughtful Cora. \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, we have a little wonder why\r\nyou should so rigidly absent yourself from a place where the gratitude of the\r\ndaughters might receive the support of a parent\xe2\x80\x99s thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father himself could tell you, that, though absent from your\r\npresence, I have not been altogether forgetful of your safety,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nthe young man; \xe2\x80\x9cthe mastery of yonder village of huts,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to\r\nthe neighboring entrenched camp, \xe2\x80\x9chas been keenly disputed; and he who\r\nholds it is sure to be possessed of this fort, and that which it contains. My\r\ndays and nights have all been passed there since we separated, because I\r\nthought that duty called me thither. But,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with an air of\r\nchagrin, which he endeavored, though unsuccessfully, to conceal, \xe2\x80\x9chad I\r\nbeen aware that what I then believed a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s conduct could be so\r\nconstrued, shame would have been added to the list of reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyward! Duncan!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Alice, bending forward to read his\r\nhalf-averted countenance, until a lock of her golden hair rested on her flushed\r\ncheek, and nearly concealed the tear that had started to her eye; \xe2\x80\x9cdid I\r\nthink this idle tongue of mine had pained you, I would silence it forever. Cora\r\ncan say, if Cora would, how justly we have prized your services, and how\r\ndeep\xe2\x80\x94I had almost said, how fervent\xe2\x80\x94is our gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will Cora attest the truth of this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Duncan, suffering\r\nthe cloud to be chased from his countenance by a smile of open pleasure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat says our graver sister? Will she find an excuse for the neglect of\r\nthe knight in the duty of a soldier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCora made no immediate answer, but turned her face toward the water, as if\r\nlooking on the sheet of the Horican. When she did bend her dark eyes on the\r\nyoung man, they were yet filled with an expression of anguish that at once\r\ndrove every thought but that of kind solicitude from his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not well, dearest Miss Munro!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nhave trifled while you are in suffering!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, refusing his support with\r\nfeminine reserve. \xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot see the sunny side of the picture of\r\nlife, like this artless but ardent enthusiast,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, laying her\r\nhand lightly, but affectionately, on the arm of her sister, \xe2\x80\x9cis the\r\npenalty of experience, and, perhaps, the misfortune of my nature. See,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe continued, as if determined to shake off infirmity, in a sense of duty;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clook around you, Major Heyward, and tell me what a prospect is this for\r\nthe daughter of a soldier whose greatest happiness is his honor and his\r\nmilitary renown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither ought nor shall be tarnished by circumstances over which he has\r\nhad no control,\xe2\x80\x9d Duncan warmly replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut your words recall me\r\nto my own duty. I go now to your gallant father, to hear his determination in\r\nmatters of the last moment to the defense. God bless you in every fortune,\r\nnoble\xe2\x80\x94Cora\xe2\x80\x94I may and must call you.\xe2\x80\x9d She frankly gave him her\r\nhand, though her lip quivered, and her cheeks gradually became of ashly\r\npaleness. \xe2\x80\x9cIn every fortune, I know you will be an ornament and honor to\r\nyour sex. Alice, adieu\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his voice changed from admiration to\r\ntenderness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cadieu, Alice; we shall soon meet again; as conquerors,\r\nI trust, and amid rejoicings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer from either, the young man threw himself down the\r\ngrassy steps of the bastion, and moving rapidly across the parade, he was\r\nquickly in the presence of their father. Munro was pacing his narrow apartment\r\nwith a disturbed air and gigantic strides as Duncan entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have anticipated my wishes, Major Heyward,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas about to request this favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to see, sir, that the messenger I so warmly recommended has\r\nreturned in custody of the French! I hope there is no reason to distrust his\r\nfidelity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fidelity of \xe2\x80\x98The Long Rifle\xe2\x80\x99 is well known to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Munro, \xe2\x80\x9cand is above suspicion; though his usual good fortune\r\nseems, at last, to have failed. Montcalm has got him, and with the accursed\r\npoliteness of his nation, he has sent him in with a doleful tale, of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98knowing how I valued the fellow, he could not think of retaining\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99 A Jesuitical way that, Major Duncan Heyward, of telling a man of\r\nhis misfortunes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the general and his succor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye look to the south as ye entered, and could ye not see\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old soldier, laughing bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cHoot! hoot!\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re an impatient boy, sir, and cannot give the gentlemen leisure for\r\ntheir march!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming, then? The scout has said as much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen? and by what path? for the dunce has omitted to tell me this. There\r\nis a letter, it would seem, too; and that is the only agreeable part of the\r\nmatter. For the customary attentions of your Marquis of Montcalm\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwarrant me, Duncan, that he of Lothian would buy a dozen such\r\nmarquisates\xe2\x80\x94but if the news of the letter were bad, the gentility of this\r\nFrench monsieur would certainly compel him to let us know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps the letter, then, while he releases the messenger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that does he, and all for the sake of what you call your\r\n\xe2\x80\x98bonhommie.\xe2\x80\x99 I would venture, if the truth was known, the\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather taught the noble science of dancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what says the scout? he has eyes and ears, and a tongue. What verbal\r\nreport does he make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! sir, he is not wanting in natural organs, and he is free to tell all\r\nthat he has seen and heard. The whole amount is this; there is a fort of his\r\nmajesty\xe2\x80\x99s on the banks of the Hudson, called Edward, in honor of his\r\ngracious highness of York, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know; and it is well filled with armed\r\nmen, as such a work should be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut was there no movement, no signs of any intention to advance to our\r\nrelief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were the morning and evening parades; and when one of the\r\nprovincial loons\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll know, Duncan, you\xe2\x80\x99re half a Scotsman\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94when one of them dropped his powder over his porretch, if it\r\ntouched the coals, it just burned!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, suddenly changing his bitter,\r\nironical manner, to one more grave and thoughtful, he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cand yet\r\nthere might, and must be, something in that letter which it would be well to\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur decision should be speedy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, gladly availing\r\nhimself of this change of humor, to press the more important objects of their\r\ninterview; \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot conceal from you, sir, that the camp will not be\r\nmuch longer tenable; and I am sorry to add, that things appear no better in the\r\nfort; more than half the guns are bursted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how should it be otherwise? Some were fished from the bottom of the\r\nlake; some have been rusting in woods since the discovery of the country; and\r\nsome were never guns at all\xe2\x80\x94mere privateersmen\xe2\x80\x99s playthings! Do you\r\nthink, sir, you can have Woolwich Warren in the midst of a wilderness, three\r\nthousand miles from Great Britain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe walls are crumbling about our ears, and provisions begin to fail\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Heyward, without regarding the new burst of indignation;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceven the men show signs of discontent and alarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Heyward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Munro, turning to his youthful associate with\r\nthe dignity of his years and superior rank; \xe2\x80\x9cI should have served his\r\nmajesty for half a century, and earned these gray hairs in vain, were I\r\nignorant of all you say, and of the pressing nature of our circumstances;\r\nstill, there is everything due to the honor of the king\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and\r\nsomething to ourselves. While there is hope of succor, this fortress will I\r\ndefend, though it be to be done with pebbles gathered on the lake shore. It is\r\na sight of the letter, therefore, that we want, that we may know the intentions\r\nof the man the earl of Loudon has left among us as his substitute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can I be of service in the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you can; the marquis of Montcalm has, in addition to his other\r\ncivilities, invited me to a personal interview between the works and his own\r\ncamp; in order, as he says, to impart some additional information. Now, I think\r\nit would not be wise to show any undue solicitude to meet him, and I would\r\nemploy you, an officer of rank, as my substitute; for it would but ill comport\r\nwith the honor of Scotland to let it be said one of her gentlemen was outdone\r\nin civility by a native of any other country on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout assuming the supererogatory task of entering into a discussion of the\r\ncomparative merits of national courtesy, Duncan cheerfully assented to supply\r\nthe place of the veteran in the approaching interview. A long and confidential\r\ncommunication now succeeded, during which the young man received some\r\nadditional insight into his duty, from the experience and native acuteness of\r\nhis commander, and then the former took his leave.\r\n\r\nAs Duncan could only act as the representative of the commandant of the fort,\r\nthe ceremonies which should have accompanied a meeting between the heads of the\r\nadverse forces were, of course, dispensed with. The truce still existed, and\r\nwith a roll and beat of the drum, and covered by a little white flag, Duncan\r\nleft the sally-port, within ten minutes after his instructions were ended. He\r\nwas received by the French officer in advance with the usual formalities, and\r\nimmediately accompanied to a distant marquee of the renowned soldier who led\r\nthe forces of France.\r\n\r\nThe general of the enemy received the youthful messenger, surrounded by his\r\nprincipal officers, and by a swarthy band of the native chiefs, who had\r\nfollowed him to the field, with the warriors of their several tribes. Heyward\r\npaused short, when, in glancing his eyes rapidly over the dark group of the\r\nlatter, he beheld the malignant countenance of Magua, regarding him with the\r\ncalm but sullen attention which marked the expression of that subtle savage. A\r\nslight exclamation of surprise even burst from the lips of the young man, but\r\ninstantly, recollecting his errand, and the presence in which he stood, he\r\nsuppressed every appearance of emotion, and turned to the hostile leader, who\r\nhad already advanced a step to receive him.\r\n\r\nThe marquis of Montcalm was, at the period of which we write, in the flower of\r\nhis age, and, it may be added, in the zenith of his fortunes. But even in that\r\nenviable situation, he was affable, and distinguished as much for his attention\r\nto the forms of courtesy, as for that chivalrous courage which, only two short\r\nyears afterward, induced him to throw away his life on the plains of Abraham.\r\nDuncan, in turning his eyes from the malign expression of Magua, suffered them\r\nto rest with pleasure on the smiling and polished features, and the noble\r\nmilitary air, of the French general.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cj\xe2\x80\x99ai beaucoup de plaisir\r\n\xc3\xa0\xe2\x80\x94bah!\xe2\x80\x94o\xc3\xb9 est cet interpr\xc3\xa9te?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe crois, monsieur, qu\xe2\x80\x99il ne sear pas n\xc3\xa9cessaire,\xe2\x80\x9d Heyward\r\nmodestly replied; \xe2\x80\x9cje parle un peu Fran\xc3\xa7ais.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! j\xe2\x80\x99en suis bien aise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Montcalm, taking Duncan\r\nfamiliarly by the arm, and leading him deep into the marquee, a little out of\r\nearshot; \xe2\x80\x9cje d\xc3\xa9teste ces fripons-l\xc3\xa0; on ne sait jamais sur quel pi\xc3\xa8 on\r\nest avec eux. Eh, bien! monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued still speaking in French;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough I should have been proud of receiving your commandant, I am very\r\nhappy that he has seen proper to employ an officer so distinguished, and who, I\r\nam sure, is so amiable, as yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan bowed low, pleased with the compliment, in spite of a most heroic\r\ndetermination to suffer no artifice to allure him into forgetfulness of the\r\ninterest of his prince; and Montcalm, after a pause of a moment, as if to\r\ncollect his thoughts, proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour commandant is a brave man, and well qualified to repel my assault.\r\nMais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and\r\nless of your courage? The one as strongly characterizes the hero as the\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe consider the qualities as inseparable,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Duncan,\r\nsmiling; \xe2\x80\x9cbut while we find in the vigor of your excellency every motive\r\nto stimulate the one, we can, as yet, see no particular call for the exercise\r\nof the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMontcalm, in his turn, slightly bowed, but it was with the air of a man too\r\npractised to remember the language of flattery. After musing a moment, he\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible my glasses have deceived me, and that your works resist\r\nour cannon better than I had supposed. You know our force?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur accounts vary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, carelessly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe highest,\r\nhowever, has not exceeded twenty thousand men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman bit his lip, and fastened his eyes keenly on the other as if to\r\nread his thoughts; then, with a readiness peculiar to himself, he continued, as\r\nif assenting to the truth of an enumeration which quite doubled his army:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a poor compliment to the vigilance of us soldiers, monsieur, that,\r\ndo what we will, we never can conceal our numbers. If it were to be done at\r\nall, one would believe it might succeed in these woods. Though you think it too\r\nsoon to listen to the calls of humanity,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, smiling archly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may be permitted to believe that gallantry is not forgotten by one so\r\nyoung as yourself. The daughters of the commandant, I learn, have passed into\r\nthe fort since it was invested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, monsieur; but, so far from weakening our efforts, they set\r\nus an example of courage in their own fortitude. Were nothing but resolution\r\nnecessary to repel so accomplished a soldier as M. de Montcalm, I would gladly\r\ntrust the defense of William Henry to the elder of those ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a wise ordinance in our Salique laws, which says, \xe2\x80\x98The\r\ncrown of France shall never degrade the lance to the distaff\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Montcalm, dryly, and with a little hauteur; but instantly adding, with his\r\nformer frank and easy air: \xe2\x80\x9cas all the nobler qualities are hereditary, I\r\ncan easily credit you; though, as I said before, courage has its limits, and\r\nhumanity must not be forgotten. I trust, monsieur, you come authorized to treat\r\nfor the surrender of the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the\r\nmeasure necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry to have the defense protracted in such a manner as to\r\nirritate my red friends there,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Montcalm, glancing his eyes at\r\nthe group of grave and attentive Indians, without attending to the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s questions; \xe2\x80\x9cI find it difficult, even now, to limit them to\r\nthe usages of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward was silent; for a painful recollection of the dangers he had so\r\nrecently escaped came over his mind, and recalled the images of those\r\ndefenseless beings who had shared in all his sufferings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCes messieurs-l\xc3\xa0,\xe2\x80\x9d said Montcalm, following up the advantage which\r\nhe conceived he had gained, \xe2\x80\x9care most formidable when baffled; and it is\r\nunnecessary to tell you with what difficulty they are restrained in their\r\nanger. Eh bien, monsieur! shall we speak of the terms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear your excellency has been deceived as to the strength of William\r\nHenry, and the resources of its garrison!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not sat down before Quebec, but an earthen work, that is defended\r\nby twenty-three hundred gallant men,\xe2\x80\x9d was the laconic reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur mounds are earthen, certainly\xe2\x80\x94nor are they seated on the rocks\r\nof Cape Diamond; but they stand on that shore which proved so destructive to\r\nDieskau and his army. There is also a powerful force within a few hours\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmarch of us, which we account upon as a part of our means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome six or eight thousand men,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Montcalm, with much\r\napparent indifference, \xe2\x80\x9cwhom their leader wisely judges to be safer in\r\ntheir works than in the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now Heyward\xe2\x80\x99s turn to bite his lip with vexation as the other so\r\ncoolly alluded to a force which the young man knew to be overrated. Both mused\r\na little while in silence, when Montcalm renewed the conversation, in a way\r\nthat showed he believed the visit of his guest was solely to propose terms of\r\ncapitulation. On the other hand, Heyward began to throw sundry inducements in\r\nthe way of the French general, to betray the discoveries he had made through\r\nthe intercepted letter. The artifice of neither, however, succeeded; and after\r\na protracted and fruitless interview, Duncan took his leave, favorably\r\nimpressed with an opinion of the courtesy and talents of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncaptain, but as ignorant of what he came to learn as when he arrived. Montcalm\r\nfollowed him as far as the entrance of the marquee, renewing his invitations to\r\nthe commandant of the fort to give him an immediate meeting in the open ground\r\nbetween the two armies.\r\n\r\nThere they separated, and Duncan returned to the advanced post of the French,\r\naccompanied as before; whence he instantly proceeded to the fort, and to the\r\nquarters of his own commander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEDG.\xe2\x80\x94Before you fight the battle ope this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lear\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Heyward found Munro attended only by his daughters. Alice sat upon his\r\nknee, parting the gray hairs on the forehead of the old man with her delicate\r\nfingers; and whenever he affected to frown on her trifling, appeasing his\r\nassumed anger by pressing her ruby lips fondly on his wrinkled brow. Cora was\r\nseated nigh them, a calm and amused looker-on; regarding the wayward movements\r\nof her more youthful sister with that species of maternal fondness which\r\ncharacterized her love for Alice. Not only the dangers through which they had\r\npassed, but those which still impended above them, appeared to be momentarily\r\nforgotten, in the soothing indulgence of such a family meeting. It seemed as if\r\nthey had profited by the short truce, to devote an instant to the purest and\r\nbest affection; the daughters forgetting their fears, and the veteran his\r\ncares, in the security of the moment. Of this scene, Duncan, who, in his\r\neagerness to report his arrival, had entered unannounced, stood many moments an\r\nunobserved and a delighted spectator. But the quick and dancing eyes of Alice\r\nsoon caught a glimpse of his figure reflected from a glass, and she sprang\r\nblushing from her father\xe2\x80\x99s knee, exclaiming aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Heyward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of the lad?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded her father; \xe2\x80\x9cI have sent him to\r\ncrack a little with the Frenchman. Ha, sir, you are young, and you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnimble! Away with you, ye baggage; as if there were not troubles enough for a\r\nsoldier, without having his camp filled with such prattling hussies as\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice laughingly followed her sister, who instantly led the way from an\r\napartment where she perceived their presence was no longer desirable. Munro,\r\ninstead of demanding the result of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s mission, paced the\r\nroom for a few moments, with his hands behind his back, and his head inclined\r\ntoward the floor, like a man lost in thought. At length he raised his eyes,\r\nglistening with a father\xe2\x80\x99s fondness, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a pair of excellent girls, Heyward, and such as any one may\r\nboast of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not now to learn my opinion of your daughters, Colonel\r\nMunro.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, lad, true,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the impatient old man; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwere about opening your mind more fully on that matter the day you got in, but\r\nI did not think it becoming in an old soldier to be talking of nuptial\r\nblessings and wedding jokes when the enemies of his king were likely to be\r\nunbidden guests at the feast. But I was wrong, Duncan, boy, I was wrong there;\r\nand I am now ready to hear what you have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding the pleasure your assurance gives me, dear sir, I have\r\njust now, a message from Montcalm\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the Frenchman and all his host go to the devil, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed the hasty veteran. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not yet master of William Henry, nor\r\nshall he ever be, provided Webb proves himself the man he should. No, sir,\r\nthank Heaven we are not yet in such a strait that it can be said Munro is too\r\nmuch pressed to discharge the little domestic duties of his own family. Your\r\nmother was the only child of my bosom friend, Duncan; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give\r\nyou a hearing, though all the knights of St. Louis were in a body at the\r\nsally-port, with the French saint at their head, crying to speak a word under\r\nfavor. A pretty degree of knighthood, sir, is that which can be bought with\r\nsugar hogsheads! and then your twopenny marquisates. The thistle is the order\r\nfor dignity and antiquity; the veritable \xe2\x80\x98nemo me impune lacessit\xe2\x80\x99\r\nof chivalry. Ye had ancestors in that degree, Duncan, and they were an ornament\r\nto the nobles of Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward, who perceived that his superior took a malicious pleasure in\r\nexhibiting his contempt for the message of the French general, was fain to\r\nhumor a spleen that he knew would be short-lived; he therefore, replied with as\r\nmuch indifference as he could assume on such a subject:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy request, as you know, sir, went so far as to presume to the honor of\r\nbeing your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, boy, you found words to make yourself very plainly comprehended.\r\nBut, let me ask ye, sir, have you been as intelligible to the girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my honor, no,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Duncan, warmly; \xe2\x80\x9cthere would\r\nhave been an abuse of a confided trust, had I taken advantage of my situation\r\nfor such a purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour notions are those of a gentleman, Major Heyward, and well enough in\r\ntheir place. But Cora Munro is a maiden too discreet, and of a mind too\r\nelevated and improved, to need the guardianship even of a father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCora!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94Cora! we are talking of your pretensions to Miss Munro, are we\r\nnot, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I was not conscious of having mentioned her name,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Duncan, stammering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to marry whom, then, did you wish my consent, Major Heyward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded the old soldier, erecting himself in the dignity of offended feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have another, and not less lovely child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the father, in an astonishment equal to that\r\nwith which Duncan had just repeated the name of her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch was the direction of my wishes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man awaited in silence the result of the extraordinary effect\r\nproduced by a communication, which, as it now appeared, was so unexpected. For\r\nseveral minutes Munro paced the chamber with long and rapid strides, his rigid\r\nfeatures working convulsively, and every faculty seemingly absorbed in the\r\nmusings of his own mind. At length, he paused directly in front of Heyward, and\r\nriveting his eyes upon those of the other, he said, with a lip that quivered\r\nviolently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuncan Heyward, I have loved you for the sake of him whose blood is in\r\nyour veins; I have loved you for your own good qualities; and I have loved you,\r\nbecause I thought you would contribute to the happiness of my child. But all\r\nthis love would turn to hatred, were I assured that what I so much apprehend is\r\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid that any act or thought of mine should lead to such a\r\nchange!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young man, whose eye never quailed under the\r\npenetrating look it encountered. Without adverting to the impossibility of the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s comprehending those feelings which were hid in his own bosom,\r\nMunro suffered himself to be appeased by the unaltered countenance he met, and\r\nwith a voice sensibly softened, he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would be my son, Duncan, and you\xe2\x80\x99re ignorant of the history of\r\nthe man you wish to call your father. Sit ye down, young man, and I will open\r\nto you the wounds of a seared heart, in as few words as may be suitable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, the message of Montcalm was as much forgotten by him who bore it\r\nas by the man for whose ears it was intended. Each drew a chair, and while the\r\nveteran communed a few moments with his own thoughts, apparently in sadness,\r\nthe youth suppressed his impatience in a look and attitude of respectful\r\nattention. At length, the former spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll know, already, Major Heyward, that my family was both\r\nancient and honorable,\xe2\x80\x9d commenced the Scotsman; \xe2\x80\x9cthough it might\r\nnot altogether be endowed with that amount of wealth that should correspond\r\nwith its degree. I was, maybe, such an one as yourself when I plighted my faith\r\nto Alice Graham, the only child of a neighboring laird of some estate. But the\r\nconnection was disagreeable to her father, on more accounts than my poverty. I\r\ndid, therefore, what an honest man should\xe2\x80\x94restored the maiden her troth,\r\nand departed the country in the service of my king. I had seen many regions,\r\nand had shed much blood in different lands, before duty called me to the\r\nislands of the West Indies. There it was my lot to form a connection with one\r\nwho in time became my wife, and the mother of Cora. She was the daughter of a\r\ngentleman of those isles, by a lady whose misfortune it was, if you\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cto be descended, remotely, from\r\nthat unfortunate class who are so basely enslaved to administer to the wants of\r\na luxurious people. Ay, sir, that is a curse, entailed on Scotland by her\r\nunnatural union with a foreign and trading people. But could I find a man among\r\nthem who would dare to reflect on my child, he should feel the weight of a\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s anger! Ha! Major Heyward, you are yourself born at the south,\r\nwhere these unfortunate beings are considered of a race inferior to your\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis most unfortunately true, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, unable any\r\nlonger to prevent his eyes from sinking to the floor in embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you cast it on my child as a reproach! You scorn to mingle the blood\r\nof the Heywards with one so degraded\xe2\x80\x94lovely and virtuous though she\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d fiercely demanded the jealous parent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Duncan, at the same time conscious of such a feeling, and that as\r\ndeeply rooted as if it had been ingrafted in his nature. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sweetness,\r\nthe beauty, the witchery of your younger daughter, Colonel Munro, might explain\r\nmy motives without imputing to me this injustice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man, again changing his tones\r\nto those of gentleness, or rather softness; \xe2\x80\x9cthe girl is the image of\r\nwhat her mother was at her years, and before she had become acquainted with\r\ngrief. When death deprived me of my wife I returned to Scotland, enriched by\r\nthe marriage; and, would you think it, Duncan! the suffering angel had remained\r\nin the heartless state of celibacy twenty long years, and that for the sake of\r\na man who could forget her! She did more, sir; she overlooked my want of faith,\r\nand, all difficulties being now removed, she took me for her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd became the mother of Alice?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Duncan, with an\r\neagerness that might have proved dangerous at a moment when the thoughts of\r\nMunro were less occupied that at present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cand dearly did she pay\r\nfor the blessing she bestowed. But she is a saint in heaven, sir; and it ill\r\nbecomes one whose foot rests on the grave to mourn a lot so blessed. I had her\r\nbut a single year, though; a short term of happiness for one who had seen her\r\nyouth fade in hopeless pining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something so commanding in the distress of the old man, that Heyward\r\ndid not dare to venture a syllable of consolation. Munro sat utterly\r\nunconscious of the other\xe2\x80\x99s presence, his features exposed and working\r\nwith the anguish of his regrets, while heavy tears fell from his eyes, and\r\nrolled unheeded from his cheeks to the floor. At length he moved, and as if\r\nsuddenly recovering his recollection; when he arose, and taking a single turn\r\nacross the room, he approached his companion with an air of military grandeur,\r\nand demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not, Major Heyward, some communication that I should hear from\r\nthe marquis de Montcalm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan started in his turn, and immediately commenced in an embarrassed voice,\r\nthe half-forgotten message. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the evasive though\r\npolite manner with which the French general had eluded every attempt of Heyward\r\nto worm from him the purport of the communication he had proposed making, or on\r\nthe decided, though still polished message, by which he now gave his enemy to\r\nunderstand, that, unless he chose to receive it in person, he should not\r\nreceive it at all. As Munro listened to the detail of Duncan, the excited\r\nfeelings of the father gradually gave way before the obligations of his\r\nstation, and when the other was done, he saw before him nothing but the\r\nveteran, swelling with the wounded feelings of a soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have said enough, Major Heyward,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the angry old man;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cenough to make a volume of commentary on French civility. Here has this\r\ngentleman invited me to a conference, and when I send him a capable substitute,\r\nfor ye\xe2\x80\x99re all that, Duncan, though your years are but few, he answers me\r\nwith a riddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have thought less favorably of the substitute, my dear sir; and\r\nyou will remember that the invitation, which he now repeats, was to the\r\ncommandant of the works, and not to his second.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity of\r\nhim who grants the commission? He wishes to confer with Munro! Faith, sir, I\r\nhave much inclination to indulge the man, if it should only be to let him\r\nbehold the firm countenance we maintain in spite of his numbers and his\r\nsummons. There might be not bad policy in such a stroke, young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, who believed it of the last importance that they should speedily come\r\nto the contents of the letter borne by the scout, gladly encouraged this idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt, he could gather no confidence by witnessing our\r\nindifference,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never said truer word. I could wish, sir, that he would visit the\r\nworks in open day, and in the form of a storming party; that is the least\r\nfailing method of proving the countenance of an enemy, and would be far\r\npreferable to the battering system he has chosen. The beauty and manliness of\r\nwarfare has been much deformed, Major Heyward, by the arts of your Monsieur\r\nVauban. Our ancestors were far above such scientific cowardice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be very true, sir; but we are now obliged to repel art by art.\r\nWhat is your pleasure in the matter of the interview?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will meet the Frenchman, and that without fear or delay; promptly,\r\nsir, as becomes a servant of my royal master. Go, Major Heyward, and give them\r\na flourish of the music; and send out a messenger to let them know who is\r\ncoming. We will follow with a small guard, for such respect is due to one who\r\nholds the honor of his king in keeping; and hark\xe2\x80\x99ee, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, in a half whisper, though they were alone, \xe2\x80\x9cit may be prudent to\r\nhave some aid at hand, in case there should be treachery at the bottom of it\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man availed himself of this order to quit the apartment; and, as the\r\nday was fast coming to a close, he hastened without delay, to make the\r\nnecessary arrangements. A very few minutes only were necessary to parade a few\r\nfiles, and to dispatch an orderly with a flag to announce the approach of the\r\ncommandant of the fort. When Duncan had done both these, he led the guard to\r\nthe sally-port, near which he found his superior ready, waiting his appearance.\r\nAs soon as the usual ceremonials of a military departure were observed, the\r\nveteran and his more youthful companion left the fortress, attended by the\r\nescort.\r\n\r\nThey had proceeded only a hundred yards from the works, when the little array\r\nwhich attended the French general to the conference was seen issuing from the\r\nhollow way which formed the bed of a brook that ran between the batteries of\r\nthe besiegers and the fort. From the moment that Munro left his own works to\r\nappear in front of his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s, his air had been grand, and his step and\r\ncountenance highly military. The instant he caught a glimpse of the white plume\r\nthat waved in the hat of Montcalm, his eye lighted, and age no longer appeared\r\nto possess any influence over his vast and still muscular person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to the boys to be watchful, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an undertone,\r\nto Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cand to look well to their flints and steel, for one is never\r\nsafe with a servant of these Louis\xe2\x80\x99s; at the same time, we shall show\r\nthem the front of men in deep security. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll understand me, Major\r\nHeyward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by the clamor of a drum from the approaching Frenchmen,\r\nwhich was immediately answered, when each party pushed an orderly in advance,\r\nbearing a white flag, and the wary Scotsman halted with his guard close at his\r\nback. As soon as this slight salutation had passed, Montcalm moved toward them\r\nwith a quick but graceful step, baring his head to the veteran, and dropping\r\nhis spotless plume nearly to the earth in courtesy. If the air of Munro was\r\nmore commanding and manly, it wanted both the ease and insinuating polish of\r\nthat of the Frenchman. Neither spoke for a few moments, each regarding the\r\nother with curious and interested eyes. Then, as became his superior rank and\r\nthe nature of the interview, Montcalm broke the silence. After uttering the\r\nusual words of greeting, he turned to Duncan, and continued, with a smile of\r\nrecognition, speaking always in French:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rejoiced, monsieur, that you have given us the pleasure of your\r\ncompany on this occasion. There will be no necessity to employ an ordinary\r\ninterpreter; for, in your hands, I feel the same security as if I spoke your\r\nlanguage myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan acknowledged the compliment, when Montcalm, turning to his guard, which\r\nin imitation of that of their enemies, pressed close upon him, continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEn arriere, mes enfants\xe2\x80\x94il fait chaud\xe2\x80\x94-retirez-vous un\r\npeu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Major Heyward would imitate this proof of confidence, he glanced his\r\neyes around the plain, and beheld with uneasiness the numerous dusky groups of\r\nsavages, who looked out from the margin of the surrounding woods, curious\r\nspectators of the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Montcalm will readily acknowledge the difference in our\r\nsituation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with some embarrassment, pointing at the same time\r\ntoward those dangerous foes, who were to be seen in almost every direction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere we to dismiss our guard, we should stand here at the mercy of our\r\nenemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, you have the plighted faith of \xe2\x80\x98un gentilhomme\r\nFran\xc3\xa7ais\xe2\x80\x99, for your safety,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Montcalm, laying his hand\r\nimpressively on his heart; \xe2\x80\x9cit should suffice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall. Fall back,\xe2\x80\x9d Duncan added to the officer who led the\r\nescort; \xe2\x80\x9cfall back, sir, beyond hearing, and wait for orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMunro witnessed this movement with manifest uneasiness; nor did he fail to\r\ndemand an instant explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not our interest, sir, to betray no distrust?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted\r\nDuncan. \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Montcalm pledges his word for our safety, and I have\r\nordered the men to withdraw a little, in order to prove how much we depend on\r\nhis assurance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be all right, sir, but I have no overweening reliance on the\r\nfaith of these marquesses, or marquis, as they call themselves. Their patents\r\nof nobility are too common to be certain that they bear the seal of true\r\nhonor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget, dear sir, that we confer with an officer, distinguished\r\nalike in Europe and America for his deeds. From a soldier of his reputation we\r\ncan have nothing to apprehend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man made a gesture of resignation, though his rigid features still\r\nbetrayed his obstinate adherence to a distrust, which he derived from a sort of\r\nhereditary contempt of his enemy, rather than from any present signs which\r\nmight warrant so uncharitable a feeling. Montcalm waited patiently until this\r\nlittle dialogue in demi-voice was ended, when he drew nigher, and opened the\r\nsubject of their conference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have solicited this interview from your superior, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I believe he will allow himself to be persuaded that he\r\nhas already done everything which is necessary for the honor of his prince, and\r\nwill now listen to the admonitions of humanity. I will forever bear testimony\r\nthat his resistance has been gallant, and was continued as long as there was\r\nhope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen this opening was translated to Munro, he answered with dignity, but with\r\nsufficient courtesy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever I may prize such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, it will be\r\nmore valuable when it shall be better merited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe French general smiled, as Duncan gave him the purport of this reply, and\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is now so freely accorded to approved courage, may be refused to\r\nuseless obstinacy. Monsieur would wish to see my camp, and witness for himself\r\nour numbers, and the impossibility of his resisting them with success?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that the king of France is well served,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nunmoved Scotsman, as soon as Duncan ended his translation; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my own\r\nroyal master has as many and as faithful troops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough not at hand, fortunately for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Montcalm, without\r\nwaiting, in his ardor, for the interpreter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a destiny in war,\r\nto which a brave man knows how to submit with the same courage that he faces\r\nhis foes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad I been conscious that Monsieur Montcalm was master of the English, I\r\nshould have spared myself the trouble of so awkward a translation,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe vexed Duncan, dryly; remembering instantly his recent by-play with Munro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour pardon, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Frenchman, suffering a slight\r\ncolor to appear on his dark cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a vast difference between\r\nunderstanding and speaking a foreign tongue; you will, therefore, please to\r\nassist me still.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, after a short pause, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cThese hills\r\nafford us every opportunity of reconnoitering your works, messieurs, and I am\r\npossibly as well acquainted with their weak condition as you can be\r\nyourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the French general if his glasses can reach to the Hudson,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Munro, proudly; \xe2\x80\x9cand if he knows when and where to expect the army\r\nof Webb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet General Webb be his own interpreter,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the politic\r\nMontcalm, suddenly extending an open letter toward Munro as he spoke;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou will there learn, monsieur, that his movements are not likely to\r\nprove embarrassing to my army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe veteran seized the offered paper, without waiting for Duncan to translate\r\nthe speech, and with an eagerness that betrayed how important he deemed its\r\ncontents. As his eye passed hastily over the words, his countenance changed\r\nfrom its look of military pride to one of deep chagrin; his lip began to\r\nquiver; and suffering the paper to fall from his hand, his head dropped upon\r\nhis chest, like that of a man whose hopes were withered at a single blow.\r\nDuncan caught the letter from the ground, and without apology for the liberty\r\nhe took, he read at a glance its cruel purport. Their common superior, so far\r\nfrom encouraging them to resist, advised a speedy surrender, urging in the\r\nplainest language, as a reason, the utter impossibility of his sending a single\r\nman to their rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is no deception!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Duncan, examining the billet both\r\ninside and out; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the signature of Webb, and must be the captured\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man has betrayed me!\xe2\x80\x9d Munro at length bitterly exclaimed;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che has brought dishonor to the door of one where disgrace was never\r\nbefore known to dwell, and shame has he heaped heavily on my gray hairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay not so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are yet masters of the fort,\r\nand of our honor. Let us, then, sell our lives at such a rate as shall make our\r\nenemies believe the purchase too dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy, I thank thee,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old man, rousing himself from\r\nhis stupor; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have, for once, reminded Munro of his duty. We will go\r\nback, and dig our graves behind those ramparts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMessieurs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Montcalm, advancing toward them a step, in\r\ngenerous interest, \xe2\x80\x9cyou little know Louis de St. Veran if you believe him\r\ncapable of profiting by this letter to humble brave men, or to build up a\r\ndishonest reputation for himself. Listen to my terms before you leave\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat says the Frenchman?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the veteran, sternly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdoes he make a merit of having captured a scout, with a note from\r\nheadquarters? Sir, he had better raise this siege, to go and sit down before\r\nEdward if he wishes to frighten his enemy with words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan explained the other\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Montcalm, we will hear you,\xe2\x80\x9d the veteran added, more\r\ncalmly, as Duncan ended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo retain the fort is now impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said his liberal enemy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is necessary to the interests of my master that it should be\r\ndestroyed; but as for yourselves and your brave comrades, there is no privilege\r\ndear to a soldier that shall be denied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur colors?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry them to England, and show them to your king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep them; none can use them better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur march; the surrender of the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall all be done in a way most honorable to yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan now turned to explain these proposals to his commander, who heard him\r\nwith amazement, and a sensibility that was deeply touched by so unusual and\r\nunexpected generosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo you, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cgo with this marquess, as,\r\nindeed, marquess he should be; go to his marquee and arrange it all. I have\r\nlived to see two things in my old age that never did I expect to behold. An\r\nEnglishman afraid to support a friend, and a Frenchman too honest to profit by\r\nhis advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, the veteran again dropped his head to his chest, and returned slowly\r\ntoward the fort, exhibiting, by the dejection of his air, to the anxious\r\ngarrison, a harbinger of evil tidings.\r\n\r\nFrom the shock of this unexpected blow the haughty feelings of Munro never\r\nrecovered; but from that moment there commenced a change in his determined\r\ncharacter, which accompanied him to a speedy grave. Duncan remained to settle\r\nthe terms of the capitulation. He was seen to re-enter the works during the\r\nfirst watches of the night, and immediately after a private conference with the\r\ncommandant, to leave them again. It was then openly announced that hostilities\r\nmust cease\xe2\x80\x94Munro having signed a treaty by which the place was to be\r\nyielded to the enemy, with the morning; the garrison to retain their arms, the\r\ncolors and their baggage, and, consequently, according to military opinion,\r\ntheir honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeave we the woof.\r\nThe thread is spun.\r\nThe web is wove.\r\nThe work is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Gray\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hostile armies, which lay in the wilds of the Horican, passed the night of\r\nthe ninth of August, 1757, much in the manner they would, had they encountered\r\non the fairest field of Europe. While the conquered were still, sullen, and\r\ndejected, the victors triumphed. But there are limits alike to grief and joy;\r\nand long before the watches of the morning came the stillness of those\r\nboundless woods was only broken by a gay call from some exulting young\r\nFrenchman of the advanced pickets, or a menacing challenge from the fort, which\r\nsternly forbade the approach of any hostile footsteps before the stipulated\r\nmoment. Even these occasional threatening sounds ceased to be heard in that\r\ndull hour which precedes the day, at which period a listener might have sought\r\nin vain any evidence of the presence of those armed powers that then slumbered\r\non the shores of the \xe2\x80\x9choly lake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was during these moments of deep silence that the canvas which concealed the\r\nentrance to a spacious marquee in the French encampment was shoved aside, and a\r\nman issued from beneath the drapery into the open air. He was enveloped in a\r\ncloak that might have been intended as a protection from the chilling damps of\r\nthe woods, but which served equally well as a mantle to conceal his person. He\r\nwas permitted to pass the grenadier, who watched over the slumbers of the\r\nFrench commander, without interruption, the man making the usual salute which\r\nbetokens military deference, as the other passed swiftly through the little\r\ncity of tents, in the direction of William Henry. Whenever this unknown\r\nindividual encountered one of the numberless sentinels who crossed his path,\r\nhis answer was prompt, and, as it appeared, satisfactory; for he was uniformly\r\nallowed to proceed without further interrogation.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of such repeated but brief interruptions, he had moved\r\nsilently from the center of the camp to its most advanced outposts, when he\r\ndrew nigh the soldier who held his watch nearest to the works of the enemy. As\r\nhe approached he was received with the usual challenge:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQui vive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrance,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe mot d\xe2\x80\x99ordre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa victorie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, drawing so nigh as to be heard in a\r\nloud whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est bien,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sentinel, throwing his musket from\r\nthe charge to his shoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cvous promenez bien matin, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIl est necessaire d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre vigilant, mon enfant,\xe2\x80\x9d the other\r\nobserved, dropping a fold of his cloak, and looking the soldier close in the\r\nface as he passed him, still continuing his way toward the British\r\nfortification. The man started; his arms rattled heavily as he threw them\r\nforward in the lowest and most respectful salute; and when he had again\r\nrecovered his piece, he turned to walk his post, muttering between his teeth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIl faut \xc3\xaatre vigilant, en v\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9! je crois que nous avons l\xc3\xa0, un caporal\r\nqui ne dort jamais!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer proceeded, without affecting to hear the words which escaped the\r\nsentinel in his surprise; nor did he again pause until he had reached the low\r\nstrand, and in a somewhat dangerous vicinity to the western water bastion of\r\nthe fort. The light of an obscure moon was just sufficient to render objects,\r\nthough dim, perceptible in their outlines. He, therefore, took the precaution\r\nto place himself against the trunk of a tree, where he leaned for many minutes,\r\nand seemed to contemplate the dark and silent mounds of the English works in\r\nprofound attention. His gaze at the ramparts was not that of a curious or idle\r\nspectator; but his looks wandered from point to point, denoting his knowledge\r\nof military usages, and betraying that his search was not unaccompanied by\r\ndistrust. At length he appeared satisfied; and having cast his eyes impatiently\r\nupward toward the summit of the eastern mountain, as if anticipating the\r\napproach of the morning, he was in the act of turning on his footsteps, when a\r\nlight sound on the nearest angle of the bastion caught his ear, and induced him\r\nto remain.\r\n\r\nJust then a figure was seen to approach the edge of the rampart, where it\r\nstood, apparently contemplating in its turn the distant tents of the French\r\nencampment. Its head was then turned toward the east, as though equally anxious\r\nfor the appearance of light, when the form leaned against the mound, and seemed\r\nto gaze upon the glassy expanse of the waters, which, like a submarine\r\nfirmament, glittered with its thousand mimic stars. The melancholy air, the\r\nhour, together with the vast frame of the man who thus leaned, musing, against\r\nthe English ramparts, left no doubt as to his person in the mind of the\r\nobservant spectator. Delicacy, no less than prudence, now urged him to retire;\r\nand he had moved cautiously round the body of the tree for that purpose, when\r\nanother sound drew his attention, and once more arrested his footsteps. It was\r\na low and almost inaudible movement of the water, and was succeeded by a\r\ngrating of pebbles one against the other. In a moment he saw a dark form rise,\r\nas it were, out of the lake, and steal without further noise to the land,\r\nwithin a few feet of the place where he himself stood. A rifle next slowly rose\r\nbetween his eyes and the watery mirror; but before it could be discharged his\r\nown hand was on the lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the savage, whose treacherous aim was so\r\nsingularly and so unexpectedly interrupted.\r\n\r\nWithout making any reply, the French officer laid his hand on the shoulder of\r\nthe Indian, and led him in profound silence to a distance from the spot, where\r\ntheir subsequent dialogue might have proved dangerous, and where it seemed that\r\none of them, at least, sought a victim. Then throwing open his cloak, so as to\r\nexpose his uniform and the cross of St. Louis which was suspended at his\r\nbreast, Montcalm sternly demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat means this? Does not my son know that the hatchet is buried between\r\nthe English and his Canadian Father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can the Hurons do?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the savage, speaking also,\r\nthough imperfectly, in the French language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a warrior has a scalp, and the pale faces make friends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, Le Renard Subtil! Methinks this is an excess of zeal for a friend\r\nwho was so late an enemy! How many suns have set since Le Renard struck the\r\nwar-post of the English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that sun?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the sullen savage. \xe2\x80\x9cBehind the\r\nhill; and it is dark and cold. But when he comes again, it will be bright and\r\nwarm. Le Subtil is the sun of his tribe. There have been clouds, and many\r\nmountains between him and his nation; but now he shines and it is a clear\r\nsky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Le Renard has power with his people, I well know,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMontcalm; \xe2\x80\x9cfor yesterday he hunted for their scalps, and to-day they hear\r\nhim at the council-fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagua is a great chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him prove it, by teaching his nation how to conduct themselves\r\ntoward our new friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did the chief of the Canadas bring his young men into the woods, and\r\nfire his cannon at the earthen house?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the subtle Indian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo subdue it. My master owns the land, and your father was ordered to\r\ndrive off these English squatters. They have consented to go, and now he calls\r\nthem enemies no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well. Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. It is\r\nnow bright; when it is red, it shall be buried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Magua is pledged not to sully the lilies of France. The enemies of\r\nthe great king across the salt lake are his enemies; his friends, the friends\r\nof the Hurons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Indian in scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cLet his father give\r\nMagua a hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMontcalm, who felt that his influence over the warlike tribes he had gathered\r\nwas to be maintained by concession rather than by power, complied reluctantly\r\nwith the other\xe2\x80\x99s request. The savage placed the fingers of the French\r\ncommander on a deep scar in his bosom, and then exultingly demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes my father know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat warrior does not? \xe2\x80\x99Tis where a leaden bullet has cut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Indian, who had turned his naked back to\r\nthe other, his body being without its usual calico mantle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis!\xe2\x80\x94my son has been sadly injured here; who has done\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagua slept hard in the English wigwams, and the sticks have left their\r\nmark,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the savage, with a hollow laugh, which did not conceal\r\nthe fierce temper that nearly choked him. Then, recollecting himself, with\r\nsudden and native dignity, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cGo; teach your young men it is\r\npeace. Le Renard Subtil knows how to speak to a Huron warrior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout deigning to bestow further words, or to wait for any answer, the savage\r\ncast his rifle into the hollow of his arm, and moved silently through the\r\nencampment toward the woods where his own tribe was known to lie. Every few\r\nyards as he proceeded he was challenged by the sentinels; but he stalked\r\nsullenly onward, utterly disregarding the summons of the soldiers, who only\r\nspared his life because they knew the air and tread no less than the obstinate\r\ndaring of an Indian.\r\n\r\nMontcalm lingered long and melancholy on the strand where he had been left by\r\nhis companion, brooding deeply on the temper which his ungovernable ally had\r\njust discovered. Already had his fair fame been tarnished by one horrid scene,\r\nand in circumstances fearfully resembling those under which he now found\r\nhimself. As he mused he became keenly sensible of the deep responsibility they\r\nassume who disregard the means to attain the end, and of all the danger of\r\nsetting in motion an engine which it exceeds human power to control. Then\r\nshaking off a train of reflections that he accounted a weakness in such a\r\nmoment of triumph, he retraced his steps toward his tent, giving the order as\r\nhe passed to make the signal that should arouse the army from its slumbers.\r\n\r\nThe first tap of the French drums was echoed from the bosom of the fort, and\r\npresently the valley was filled with the strains of martial music, rising long,\r\nthrilling and lively above the rattling accompaniment. The horns of the victors\r\nsounded merry and cheerful flourishes, until the last laggard of the camp was\r\nat his post; but the instant the British fifes had blown their shrill signal,\r\nthey became mute. In the meantime the day had dawned, and when the line of the\r\nFrench army was ready to receive its general, the rays of a brilliant sun were\r\nglancing along the glittering array. Then that success, which was already so\r\nwell known, was officially announced; the favored band who were selected to\r\nguard the gates of the fort were detailed, and defiled before their chief; the\r\nsignal of their approach was given, and all the usual preparations for a change\r\nof masters were ordered and executed directly under the guns of the contested\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nA very different scene presented itself within the lines of the Anglo-American\r\narmy. As soon as the warning signal was given, it exhibited all the signs of a\r\nhurried and forced departure. The sullen soldiers shouldered their empty tubes\r\nand fell into their places, like men whose blood had been heated by the past\r\ncontest, and who only desired the opportunity to revenge an indignity which was\r\nstill wounding to their pride, concealed as it was under the observances of\r\nmilitary etiquette.\r\n\r\nWomen and children ran from place to place, some bearing the scanty remnants of\r\ntheir baggage, and others searching in the ranks for those countenances they\r\nlooked up to for protection.\r\n\r\nMunro appeared among his silent troops firm but dejected. It was evident that\r\nthe unexpected blow had struck deep into his heart, though he struggled to\r\nsustain his misfortune with the port of a man.\r\n\r\nDuncan was touched at the quiet and impressive exhibition of his grief. He had\r\ndischarged his own duty, and he now pressed to the side of the old man, to know\r\nin what particular he might serve him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d was the brief but expressive reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! are not arrangements already made for their\r\nconvenience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day I am only a soldier, Major Heyward,\xe2\x80\x9d said the veteran.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that you see here, claim alike to be my children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan had heard enough. Without losing one of those moments which had now\r\nbecome so precious, he flew toward the quarters of Munro, in quest of the\r\nsisters. He found them on the threshold of the low edifice, already prepared to\r\ndepart, and surrounded by a clamorous and weeping assemblage of their own sex,\r\nthat had gathered about the place, with a sort of instinctive consciousness\r\nthat it was the point most likely to be protected. Though the cheeks of Cora\r\nwere pale and her countenance anxious, she had lost none of her firmness; but\r\nthe eyes of Alice were inflamed, and betrayed how long and bitterly she had\r\nwept. They both, however, received the young man with undisguised pleasure; the\r\nformer, for a novelty, being the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fort is lost,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a melancholy smile;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough our good name, I trust, remains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis brighter than ever. But, dearest Miss Munro, it is time to\r\nthink less of others, and to make some provision for yourself. Military\r\nusage\xe2\x80\x94pride\xe2\x80\x94that pride on which you so much value yourself, demands\r\nthat your father and I should for a little while continue with the troops. Then\r\nwhere to seek a proper protector for you against the confusion and chances of\r\nsuch a scene?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cora; \xe2\x80\x9cwho will dare to injure\r\nor insult the daughter of such a father, at a time like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not leave you alone,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the youth, looking about\r\nhim in a hurried manner, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the command of the best regiment in the pay\r\nof the king. Remember, our Alice is not gifted with all your firmness, and God\r\nonly knows the terror she might endure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be right,\xe2\x80\x9d Cora replied, smiling again, but far more sadly\r\nthan before. \xe2\x80\x9cListen! chance has already sent us a friend when he is most\r\nneeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan did listen, and on the instant comprehended her meaning. The low and\r\nserious sounds of the sacred music, so well known to the eastern provinces,\r\ncaught his ear, and instantly drew him to an apartment in an adjacent building,\r\nwhich had already been deserted by its customary tenants. There he found David,\r\npouring out his pious feelings through the only medium in which he ever\r\nindulged. Duncan waited, until, by the cessation of the movement of the hand,\r\nhe believed the strain was ended, when, by touching his shoulder, he drew the\r\nattention of the other to himself, and in a few words explained his wishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the single-minded disciple of the King of\r\nIsrael, when the young man had ended; \xe2\x80\x9cI have found much that is comely\r\nand melodious in the maidens, and it is fitting that we who have consorted in\r\nso much peril, should abide together in peace. I will attend them, when I have\r\ncompleted my morning praise, to which nothing is now wanting but the doxology.\r\nWilt thou bear a part, friend? The meter is common, and the tune\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Southwell\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, extending the little volume, and giving the pitch of the air anew with\r\nconsiderate attention, David recommenced and finished his strains, with a\r\nfixedness of manner that it was not easy to interrupt. Heyward was fain to wait\r\nuntil the verse was ended; when, seeing David relieving himself from the\r\nspectacles, and replacing the book, he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be your duty to see that none dare to approach the ladies with\r\nany rude intention, or to offer insult or taunt at the misfortune of their\r\nbrave father. In this task you will be seconded by the domestics of their\r\nhousehold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible that the Indians and stragglers of the enemy may intrude,\r\nin which case you will remind them of the terms of the capitulation, and\r\nthreaten to report their conduct to Montcalm. A word will suffice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf not, I have that here which shall,\xe2\x80\x9d returned David, exhibiting\r\nhis book, with an air in which meekness and confidence were singularly blended.\r\nHere are words which, uttered, or rather thundered, with proper emphasis, and\r\nin measured time, shall quiet the most unruly temper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why rage the heathen furiously\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward, interrupting the burst of his musical\r\ninvocation; \xe2\x80\x9cwe understand each other; it is time that we should now\r\nassume our respective duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGamut cheerfully assented, and together they sought the females. Cora received\r\nher new and somewhat extraordinary protector courteously, at least; and even\r\nthe pallid features of Alice lighted again with some of their native archness\r\nas she thanked Heyward for his care. Duncan took occasion to assure them he had\r\ndone the best that circumstances permitted, and, as he believed, quite enough\r\nfor the security of their feelings; of danger there was none. He then spoke\r\ngladly of his intention to rejoin them the moment he had led the advance a few\r\nmiles toward the Hudson, and immediately took his leave.\r\n\r\nBy this time the signal for departure had been given, and the head of the\r\nEnglish column was in motion. The sisters started at the sound, and glancing\r\ntheir eyes around, they saw the white uniforms of the French grenadiers, who\r\nhad already taken possession of the gates of the fort. At that moment an\r\nenormous cloud seemed to pass suddenly above their heads, and, looking upward,\r\nthey discovered that they stood beneath the wide folds of the standard of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is no longer a fit place for\r\nthe children of an English officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice clung to the arm of her sister, and together they left the parade,\r\naccompanied by the moving throng that surrounded them.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the gates, the French officers, who had learned their rank,\r\nbowed often and low, forbearing, however, to intrude those attentions which\r\nthey saw, with peculiar tact, might not be agreeable. As every vehicle and each\r\nbeast of burden was occupied by the sick and wounded, Cora had decided to\r\nendure the fatigues of a foot march, rather than interfere with their comforts.\r\nIndeed, many a maimed and feeble soldier was compelled to drag his exhausted\r\nlimbs in the rear of the columns, for the want of the necessary means of\r\nconveyance in that wilderness. The whole, however, was in motion; the weak and\r\nwounded, groaning and in suffering; their comrades silent and sullen; and the\r\nwomen and children in terror, they knew not of what.\r\n\r\nAs the confused and timid throng left the protecting mounds of the fort, and\r\nissued on the open plain, the whole scene was at once presented to their eyes.\r\nAt a little distance on the right, and somewhat in the rear, the French army\r\nstood to their arms, Montcalm having collected his parties, so soon as his\r\nguards had possession of the works. They were attentive but silent observers of\r\nthe proceedings of the vanquished, failing in none of the stipulated military\r\nhonors, and offering no taunt or insult, in their success, to their less\r\nfortunate foes. Living masses of the English, to the amount, in the whole, of\r\nnear three thousand, were moving slowly across the plain, toward the common\r\ncenter, and gradually approached each other, as they converged to the point of\r\ntheir march, a vista cut through the lofty trees, where the road to the Hudson\r\nentered the forest. Along the sweeping borders of the woods hung a dark cloud\r\nof savages, eyeing the passage of their enemies, and hovering at a distance,\r\nlike vultures who were only kept from swooping on their prey by the presence\r\nand restraint of a superior army. A few had straggled among the conquered\r\ncolumns, where they stalked in sullen discontent; attentive, though, as yet,\r\npassive observers of the moving multitude.\r\n\r\nThe advance, with Heyward at its head, had already reached the defile, and was\r\nslowly disappearing, when the attention of Cora was drawn to a collection of\r\nstragglers by the sounds of contention. A truant provincial was paying the\r\nforfeit of his disobedience, by being plundered of those very effects which had\r\ncaused him to desert his place in the ranks. The man was of powerful frame, and\r\ntoo avaricious to part with his goods without a struggle. Individuals from\r\neither party interfered; the one side to prevent and the other to aid in the\r\nrobbery. Voices grew loud and angry, and a hundred savages appeared, as it\r\nwere, by magic, where a dozen only had been seen a minute before. It was then\r\nthat Cora saw the form of Magua gliding among his countrymen, and speaking with\r\nhis fatal and artful eloquence. The mass of women and children stopped, and\r\nhovered together like alarmed and fluttering birds. But the cupidity of the\r\nIndian was soon gratified, and the different bodies again moved slowly onward.\r\n\r\nThe savages now fell back, and seemed content to let their enemies advance\r\nwithout further molestation. But, as the female crowd approached them, the\r\ngaudy colors of a shawl attracted the eyes of a wild and untutored Huron. He\r\nadvanced to seize it without the least hesitation. The woman, more in terror\r\nthan through love of the ornament, wrapped her child in the coveted article,\r\nand folded both more closely to her bosom. Cora was in the act of speaking,\r\nwith an intent to advise the woman to abandon the trifle, when the savage\r\nrelinquished his hold of the shawl, and tore the screaming infant from her\r\narms. Abandoning everything to the greedy grasp of those around her, the mother\r\ndarted, with distraction in her mien, to reclaim her child. The Indian smiled\r\ngrimly, and extended one hand, in sign of a willingness to exchange, while,\r\nwith the other, he flourished the babe over his head, holding it by the feet as\r\nif to enhance the value of the ransom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x94all\xe2\x80\x94any\xe2\x80\x94everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed the breathless woman, tearing the lighter articles of dress from her\r\nperson with ill-directed and trembling fingers; \xe2\x80\x9ctake all, but give me my\r\nbabe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe savage spurned the worthless rags, and perceiving that the shawl had\r\nalready become a prize to another, his bantering but sullen smile changing to a\r\ngleam of ferocity, he dashed the head of the infant against a rock, and cast\r\nits quivering remains to her very feet. For an instant the mother stood, like a\r\nstatue of despair, looking wildly down at the unseemly object, which had so\r\nlately nestled in her bosom and smiled in her face; and then she raised her\r\neyes and countenance toward heaven, as if calling on God to curse the\r\nperpetrator of the foul deed. She was spared the sin of such a prayer for,\r\nmaddened at his disappointment, and excited at the sight of blood, the Huron\r\nmercifully drove his tomahawk into her own brain. The mother sank under the\r\nblow, and fell, grasping at her child, in death, with the same engrossing love\r\nthat had caused her to cherish it when living.\r\n\r\nAt that dangerous moment, Magua placed his hands to his mouth, and raised the\r\nfatal and appalling whoop. The scattered Indians started at the well-known cry,\r\nas coursers bound at the signal to quit the goal; and directly there arose such\r\na yell along the plain, and through the arches of the wood, as seldom burst\r\nfrom human lips before. They who heard it listened with a curdling horror at\r\nthe heart, little inferior to that dread which may be expected to attend the\r\nblasts of the final summons.\r\n\r\nMore than two thousand raving savages broke from the forest at the signal, and\r\nthrew themselves across the fatal plain with instinctive alacrity. We shall not\r\ndwell on the revolting horrors that succeeded. Death was everywhere, and in his\r\nmost terrific and disgusting aspects. Resistance only served to inflame the\r\nmurderers, who inflicted their furious blows long after their victims were\r\nbeyond the power of their resentment. The flow of blood might be likened to the\r\noutbreaking of a torrent; and as the natives became heated and maddened by the\r\nsight, many among them even kneeled to the earth, and drank freely, exultingly,\r\nhellishly, of the crimson tide.\r\n\r\nThe trained bodies of the troops threw themselves quickly into solid masses,\r\nendeavoring to awe their assailants by the imposing appearance of a military\r\nfront. The experiment in some measure succeeded, though far too many suffered\r\ntheir unloaded muskets to be torn from their hands, in the vain hope of\r\nappeasing the savages.\r\n\r\nIn such a scene none had leisure to note the fleeting moments. It might have\r\nbeen ten minutes (it seemed an age) that the sisters had stood riveted to one\r\nspot, horror-stricken and nearly helpless. When the first blow was struck,\r\ntheir screaming companions had pressed upon them in a body, rendering flight\r\nimpossible; and now that fear or death had scattered most, if not all, from\r\naround them, they saw no avenue open, but such as conducted to the tomahawks of\r\ntheir foes. On every side arose shrieks, groans, exhortations and curses. At\r\nthis moment, Alice caught a glimpse of the vast form of her father, moving\r\nrapidly across the plain, in the direction of the French army. He was, in\r\ntruth, proceeding to Montcalm, fearless of every danger, to claim the tardy\r\nescort for which he had before conditioned. Fifty glittering axes and barbed\r\nspears were offered unheeded at his life, but the savages respected his rank\r\nand calmness, even in their fury. The dangerous weapons were brushed aside by\r\nthe still nervous arm of the veteran, or fell of themselves, after menacing an\r\nact that it would seem no one had courage to perform. Fortunately, the\r\nvindictive Magua was searching for his victim in the very band the veteran had\r\njust quitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather\xe2\x80\x94father\xe2\x80\x94we are here!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Alice, as he\r\npassed, at no great distance, without appearing to heed them. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to\r\nus, father, or we die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cry was repeated, and in terms and tones that might have melted a heart of\r\nstone, but it was unanswered. Once, indeed, the old man appeared to catch the\r\nsound, for he paused and listened; but Alice had dropped senseless on the\r\nearth, and Cora had sunk at her side, hovering in untiring tenderness over her\r\nlifeless form. Munro shook his head in disappointment, and proceeded, bent on\r\nthe high duty of his station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gamut, who, helpless and useless as he was, had not\r\nyet dreamed of deserting his trust, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the jubilee of the devils, and\r\nthis is not a meet place for Christians to tarry in. Let us up and fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora, still gazing at her unconscious sister;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csave thyself. To me thou canst not be of further use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid comprehended the unyielding character of her resolution, by the simple\r\nbut expressive gesture that accompanied her words. He gazed for a moment at the\r\ndusky forms that were acting their hellish rites on every side of him, and his\r\ntall person grew more erect while his chest heaved, and every feature swelled,\r\nand seemed to speak with the power of the feelings by which he was governed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Jewish boy might tame the great spirit of Saul by the sound of\r\nhis harp, and the words of sacred song, it may not be amiss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto try the potency of music here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen raising his voice to its highest tone, he poured out a strain so powerful\r\nas to be heard even amid the din of that bloody field. More than one savage\r\nrushed toward them, thinking to rifle the unprotected sisters of their attire,\r\nand bear away their scalps; but when they found this strange and unmoved figure\r\nriveted to his post, they paused to listen. Astonishment soon changed to\r\nadmiration, and they passed on to other and less courageous victims, openly\r\nexpressing their satisfaction at the firmness with which the white warrior sang\r\nhis death song. Encouraged and deluded by his success, David exerted all his\r\npowers to extend what he believed so holy an influence. The unwonted sounds\r\ncaught the ears of a distant savage, who flew raging from group to group, like\r\none who, scorning to touch the vulgar herd, hunted for some victim more worthy\r\nof his renown. It was Magua, who uttered a yell of pleasure when he beheld his\r\nancient prisoners again at his mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying his soiled hands on the dress of Cora,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe wigwam of the Huron is still open. Is it not better than this\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cora, veiling her eyes from his revolting aspect.\r\n\r\nThe Indian laughed tauntingly, as he held up his reeking hand, and answered:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is red, but it comes from white veins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonster! there is blood, oceans of blood, upon thy soul; thy spirit has\r\nmoved this scene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagua is a great chief!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the exulting savage, \xe2\x80\x9cwill\r\nthe dark-hair go to his tribe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! strike if thou wilt, and complete thy revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhesitated a moment, and then catching the light and senseless form of Alice in\r\nhis arms, the subtle Indian moved swiftly across the plain toward the woods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Cora, following wildly on his footsteps;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crelease the child! wretch! what is\xe2\x80\x99t you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Magua was deaf to her voice; or, rather, he knew his power, and was\r\ndetermined to maintain it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay\xe2\x80\x94lady\xe2\x80\x94stay,\xe2\x80\x9d called Gamut, after the unconscious\r\nCora. \xe2\x80\x9cThe holy charm is beginning to be felt, and soon shalt thou see\r\nthis horrid tumult stilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerceiving that, in his turn, he was unheeded, the faithful David followed the\r\ndistracted sister, raising his voice again in sacred song, and sweeping the air\r\nto the measure, with his long arm, in diligent accompaniment. In this manner\r\nthey traversed the plain, through the flying, the wounded and the dead. The\r\nfierce Huron was, at any time, sufficient for himself and the victim that he\r\nbore; though Cora would have fallen more than once under the blows of her\r\nsavage enemies, but for the extraordinary being who stalked in her rear, and\r\nwho now appeared to the astonished natives gifted with the protecting spirit of\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nMagua, who knew how to avoid the more pressing dangers, and also to elude\r\npursuit, entered the woods through a low ravine, where he quickly found the\r\nNarragansetts, which the travelers had abandoned so shortly before, awaiting\r\nhis appearance, in custody of a savage as fierce and malign in his expression\r\nas himself. Laying Alice on one of the horses, he made a sign to Cora to mount\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the horror excited by the presence of her captor, there was a\r\npresent relief in escaping from the bloody scene enacting on the plain, to\r\nwhich Cora could not be altogether insensible. She took her seat, and held\r\nforth her arms for her sister, with an air of entreaty and love that even the\r\nHuron could not deny. Placing Alice, then, on the same animal with Cora, he\r\nseized the bridle, and commenced his route by plunging deeper into the forest.\r\nDavid, perceiving that he was left alone, utterly disregarded as a subject too\r\nworthless even to destroy, threw his long limb across the saddle of the beast\r\nthey had deserted, and made such progress in the pursuit as the difficulties of\r\nthe path permitted.\r\n\r\nThey soon began to ascend; but as the motion had a tendency to revive the\r\ndormant faculties of her sister, the attention of Cora was too much divided\r\nbetween the tenderest solicitude in her behalf, and in listening to the cries\r\nwhich were still too audible on the plain, to note the direction in which they\r\njourneyed. When, however, they gained the flattened surface of the\r\nmountain-top, and approached the eastern precipice, she recognized the spot to\r\nwhich she had once before been led under the more friendly auspices of the\r\nscout. Here Magua suffered them to dismount; and notwithstanding their own\r\ncaptivity, the curiosity which seems inseparable from horror, induced them to\r\ngaze at the sickening sight below.\r\n\r\nThe cruel work was still unchecked. On every side the captured were flying\r\nbefore their relentless persecutors, while the armed columns of the Christian\r\nking stood fast in an apathy which has never been explained, and which has left\r\nan immovable blot on the otherwise fair escutcheon of their leader. Nor was the\r\nsword of death stayed until cupidity got the mastery of revenge. Then, indeed,\r\nthe shrieks of the wounded, and the yells of their murderers grew less\r\nfrequent, until, finally, the cries of horror were lost to their ear, or were\r\ndrowned in the loud, long and piercing whoops of the triumphant savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, anything;\r\nAn honorable murderer, if you will;\r\nFor naught I did in hate, but all in honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Othello\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bloody and inhuman scene rather incidentally mentioned than described in\r\nthe preceding chapter, is conspicuous in the pages of colonial history by the\r\nmerited title of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Massacre of William Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d It so far\r\ndeepened the stain which a previous and very similar event had left upon the\r\nreputation of the French commander that it was not entirely erased by his early\r\nand glorious death. It is now becoming obscured by time; and thousands, who\r\nknow that Montcalm died like a hero on the plains of Abraham, have yet to learn\r\nhow much he was deficient in that moral courage without which no man can be\r\ntruly great. Pages might yet be written to prove, from this illustrious\r\nexample, the defects of human excellence; to show how easy it is for generous\r\nsentiments, high courtesy, and chivalrous courage to lose their influence\r\nbeneath the chilling blight of selfishness, and to exhibit to the world a man\r\nwho was great in all the minor attributes of character, but who was found\r\nwanting when it became necessary to prove how much principle is superior to\r\npolicy. But the task would exceed our prerogatives; and, as history, like love,\r\nis so apt to surround her heroes with an atmosphere of imaginary brightness, it\r\nis probable that Louis de Saint Veran will be viewed by posterity only as the\r\ngallant defender of his country, while his cruel apathy on the shores of the\r\nOswego and of the Horican will be forgotten. Deeply regretting this weakness on\r\nthe part of a sister muse, we shall at once retire from her sacred precincts,\r\nwithin the proper limits of our own humble vocation.\r\n\r\nThe third day from the capture of the fort was drawing to a close, but the\r\nbusiness of the narrative must still detain the reader on the shores of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9choly lake.\xe2\x80\x9d When last seen, the environs of the works were filled\r\nwith violence and uproar. They were now possessed by stillness and death. The\r\nblood-stained conquerors had departed; and their camp, which had so lately rung\r\nwith the merry rejoicings of a victorious army, lay a silent and deserted city\r\nof huts. The fortress was a smoldering ruin; charred rafters, fragments of\r\nexploded artillery, and rent mason-work covering its earthen mounds in confused\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nA frightful change had also occurred in the season. The sun had hid its warmth\r\nbehind an impenetrable mass of vapor, and hundreds of human forms, which had\r\nblackened beneath the fierce heats of August, were stiffening in their\r\ndeformity before the blasts of a premature November. The curling and spotless\r\nmists, which had been seen sailing above the hills toward the north, were now\r\nreturning in an interminable dusky sheet, that was urged along by the fury of a\r\ntempest. The crowded mirror of the Horican was gone; and, in its place, the\r\ngreen and angry waters lashed the shores, as if indignantly casting back its\r\nimpurities to the polluted strand. Still the clear fountain retained a portion\r\nof its charmed influence, but it reflected only the somber gloom that fell from\r\nthe impending heavens. That humid and congenial atmosphere which commonly\r\nadorned the view, veiling its harshness, and softening its asperities, had\r\ndisappeared, the northern air poured across the waste of water so harsh and\r\nunmingled, that nothing was left to be conjectured by the eye, or fashioned by\r\nthe fancy.\r\n\r\nThe fiercer element had cropped the verdure of the plain, which looked as\r\nthough it were scathed by the consuming lightning. But, here and there, a dark\r\ngreen tuft rose in the midst of the desolation; the earliest fruits of a soil\r\nthat had been fattened with human blood. The whole landscape, which, seen by a\r\nfavoring light, and in a genial temperature, had been found so lovely, appeared\r\nnow like some pictured allegory of life, in which objects were arrayed in their\r\nharshest but truest colors, and without the relief of any shadowing.\r\n\r\nThe solitary and arid blades of grass arose from the passing gusts fearfully\r\nperceptible; the bold and rocky mountains were too distinct in their\r\nbarrenness, and the eye even sought relief, in vain, by attempting to pierce\r\nthe illimitable void of heaven, which was shut to its gaze by the dusky sheet\r\nof ragged and driving vapor.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew unequally; sometimes sweeping heavily along the ground, seeming\r\nto whisper its moanings in the cold ears of the dead, then rising in a shrill\r\nand mournful whistling, it entered the forest with a rush that filled the air\r\nwith the leaves and branches it scattered in its path. Amid the unnatural\r\nshower, a few hungry ravens struggled with the gale; but no sooner was the\r\ngreen ocean of woods which stretched beneath them, passed, than they gladly\r\nstopped, at random, to their hideous banquet.\r\n\r\nIn short, it was a scene of wildness and desolation; and it appeared as if all\r\nwho had profanely entered it had been stricken, at a blow, by the relentless\r\narm of death. But the prohibition had ceased; and for the first time since the\r\nperpetrators of those foul deeds which had assisted to disfigure the scene were\r\ngone, living human beings had now presumed to approach the place.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before the setting of the sun, on the day already mentioned, the\r\nforms of five men might have been seen issuing from the narrow vista of trees,\r\nwhere the path to the Hudson entered the forest, and advancing in the direction\r\nof the ruined works. At first their progress was slow and guarded, as though\r\nthey entered with reluctance amid the horrors of the post, or dreaded the\r\nrenewal of its frightful incidents. A light figure preceded the rest of the\r\nparty, with the caution and activity of a native; ascending every hillock to\r\nreconnoiter, and indicating by gestures, to his companions, the route he deemed\r\nit most prudent to pursue. Nor were those in the rear wanting in every caution\r\nand foresight known to forest warfare. One among them, he also was an Indian,\r\nmoved a little on one flank, and watched the margin of the woods, with eyes\r\nlong accustomed to read the smallest sign of danger. The remaining three were\r\nwhite, though clad in vestments adapted, both in quality and color, to their\r\npresent hazardous pursuit\xe2\x80\x94that of hanging on the skirts of a retiring\r\narmy in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced by the appalling sights that constantly arose in their\r\npath to the lake shore, were as different as the characters of the respective\r\nindividuals who composed the party. The youth in front threw serious but\r\nfurtive glances at the mangled victims, as he stepped lightly across the plain,\r\nafraid to exhibit his feelings, and yet too inexperienced to quell entirely\r\ntheir sudden and powerful influence. His red associate, however, was superior\r\nto such a weakness. He passed the groups of dead with a steadiness of purpose,\r\nand an eye so calm, that nothing but long and inveterate practise could enable\r\nhim to maintain. The sensations produced in the minds of even the white men\r\nwere different, though uniformly sorrowful. One, whose gray locks and furrowed\r\nlineaments, blending with a martial air and tread, betrayed, in spite of the\r\ndisguise of a woodsman\xe2\x80\x99s dress, a man long experienced in scenes of war,\r\nwas not ashamed to groan aloud, whenever a spectacle of more than usual horror\r\ncame under his view. The young man at his elbow shuddered, but seemed to\r\nsuppress his feelings in tenderness to his companion. Of them all, the\r\nstraggler who brought up the rear appeared alone to betray his real thoughts,\r\nwithout fear of observation or dread of consequences. He gazed at the most\r\nappalling sight with eyes and muscles that knew not how to waver, but with\r\nexecrations so bitter and deep as to denote how much he denounced the crime of\r\nhis enemies.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perceive at once, in these respective characters, the Mohicans,\r\nand their white friend, the scout; together with Munro and Heyward. It was, in\r\ntruth, the father in quest of his children, attended by the youth who felt so\r\ndeep a stake in their happiness, and those brave and trusty foresters, who had\r\nalready proved their skill and fidelity through the trying scenes related.\r\n\r\nWhen Uncas, who moved in front, had reached the center of the plain, he raised\r\na cry that drew his companions in a body to the spot. The young warrior had\r\nhalted over a group of females who lay in a cluster, a confused mass of dead.\r\nNotwithstanding the revolting horror of the exhibition, Munro and Heyward flew\r\ntoward the festering heap, endeavoring, with a love that no unseemliness could\r\nextinguish, to discover whether any vestiges of those they sought were to be\r\nseen among the tattered and many-colored garments. The father and the lover\r\nfound instant relief in the search; though each was condemned again to\r\nexperience the misery of an uncertainty that was hardly less insupportable than\r\nthe most revolting truth. They were standing, silent and thoughtful, around the\r\nmelancholy pile, when the scout approached. Eyeing the sad spectacle with an\r\nangry countenance, the sturdy woodsman, for the first time since his entering\r\nthe plain, spoke intelligibly and aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been on many a shocking field, and have followed a trail of blood\r\nfor weary miles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut never have I found the hand of the\r\ndevil so plain as it is here to be seen! Revenge is an Indian feeling, and all\r\nwho know me know that there is no cross in my veins; but this much will I\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94here, in the face of heaven, and with the power of the Lord so\r\nmanifest in this howling wilderness\xe2\x80\x94that should these Frenchers ever\r\ntrust themselves again within the range of a ragged bullet, there is one rifle\r\nwhich shall play its part so long as flint will fire or powder burn! I leave\r\nthe tomahawk and knife to such as have a natural gift to use them. What say\r\nyou, Chingachgook,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in Delaware; \xe2\x80\x9cshall the Hurons boast\r\nof this to their women when the deep snows come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gleam of resentment flashed across the dark lineaments of the Mohican chief;\r\nhe loosened his knife in his sheath; and then turning calmly from the sight,\r\nhis countenance settled into a repose as deep as if he knew the instigation of\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMontcalm! Montcalm!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the deeply resentful and less\r\nself-restrained scout; \xe2\x80\x9cthey say a time must come when all the deeds done\r\nin the flesh will be seen at a single look; and that by eyes cleared from\r\nmortal infirmities. Woe betide the wretch who is born to behold this plain,\r\nwith the judgment hanging about his soul! Ha\xe2\x80\x94as I am a man of white\r\nblood, yonder lies a red-skin, without the hair of his head where nature rooted\r\nit! Look to him, Delaware; it may be one of your missing people; and he should\r\nhave burial like a stout warrior. I see it in your eye, Sagamore; a Huron pays\r\nfor this, afore the fall winds have blown away the scent of the blood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChingachgook approached the mutilated form, and, turning it over, he found the\r\ndistinguishing marks of one of those six allied tribes, or nations, as they\r\nwere called, who, while they fought in the English ranks, were so deadly\r\nhostile to his own people. Spurning the loathsome object with his foot, he\r\nturned from it with the same indifference he would have quitted a brute\r\ncarcass. The scout comprehended the action, and very deliberately pursued his\r\nown way, continuing, however, his denunciations against the French commander in\r\nthe same resentful strain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but vast wisdom and unlimited power should dare to sweep off men\r\nin multitudes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is only the one that can know the\r\nnecessity of the judgment; and what is there, short of the other, that can\r\nreplace the creatures of the Lord? I hold it a sin to kill the second buck\r\nafore the first is eaten, unless a march in front, or an ambushment, be\r\ncontemplated. It is a different matter with a few warriors in open and rugged\r\nfight, for \xe2\x80\x99tis their gift to die with the rifle or the tomahawk in hand;\r\naccording as their natures may happen to be, white or red. Uncas, come this\r\nway, lad, and let the ravens settle upon the Mingo. I know, from often seeing\r\nit, that they have a craving for the flesh of an Oneida; and it is as well to\r\nlet the bird follow the gift of its natural appetite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young Mohican, rising on the extremities of\r\nhis feet, and gazing intently in his front, frightening the ravens to some\r\nother prey by the sound and the action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the scout, lowering his tall form into\r\na crouching attitude, like a panther about to take his leap; \xe2\x80\x9cGod send it\r\nbe a tardy Frencher, skulking for plunder. I do believe \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwould take an uncommon range today!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas, without making any reply, bounded away from the spot, and in the next\r\ninstant he was seen tearing from a bush, and waving in triumph, a fragment of\r\nthe green riding-veil of Cora. The movement, the exhibition, and the cry which\r\nagain burst from the lips of the young Mohican, instantly drew the whole party\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Munro, speaking quickly and wildly; \xe2\x80\x9cgive me\r\nmy child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncas will try,\xe2\x80\x9d was the short and touching answer.\r\n\r\nThe simple but meaning assurance was lost on the father, who seized the piece\r\nof gauze, and crushed it in his hand, while his eyes roamed fearfully among the\r\nbushes, as if he equally dreaded and hoped for the secrets they might reveal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are no dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cthe storm seems not to\r\nhave passed this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s manifest; and clearer than the heavens above our\r\nheads,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the undisturbed scout; \xe2\x80\x9cbut either she, or they\r\nthat have robbed her, have passed the bush; for I remember the rag she wore to\r\nhide a face that all did love to look upon. Uncas, you are right; the dark-hair\r\nhas been here, and she has fled like a frightened fawn, to the wood; none who\r\ncould fly would remain to be murdered. Let us search for the marks she left;\r\nfor, to Indian eyes, I sometimes think a humming-bird leaves his trail in the\r\nair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Mohican darted away at the suggestion, and the scout had hardly done\r\nspeaking, before the former raised a cry of success from the margin of the\r\nforest. On reaching the spot, the anxious party perceived another portion of\r\nthe veil fluttering on the lower branch of a beech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, softly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, extending his long rifle in front\r\nof the eager Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cwe now know our work, but the beauty of the trail\r\nmust not be deformed. A step too soon may give us hours of trouble. We have\r\nthem, though; that much is beyond denial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless ye, bless ye, worthy man!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Munro; \xe2\x80\x9cwhither\r\nthen, have they fled, and where are my babes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe path they have taken depends on many chances. If they have gone\r\nalone, they are quite as likely to move in a circle as straight, and they may\r\nbe within a dozen miles of us; but if the Hurons, or any of the French Indians,\r\nhave laid hands on them, \xe2\x80\x99tis probably they are now near the borders of\r\nthe Canadas. But what matters that?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the deliberate scout,\r\nobserving the powerful anxiety and disappointment the listeners exhibited;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere are the Mohicans and I on one end of the trail, and, rely on it, we\r\nfind the other, though they should be a hundred leagues asunder! Gently,\r\ngently, Uncas, you are as impatient as a man in the settlements; you forget\r\nthat light feet leave but faint marks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Chingachgook, who had been occupied in examining\r\nan opening that had been evidently made through the low underbrush which\r\nskirted the forest; and who now stood erect, as he pointed downward, in the\r\nattitude and with the air of a man who beheld a disgusting serpent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the palpable impression of the footstep of a man,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nHeyward, bending over the indicated spot; \xe2\x80\x9che has trod in the margin of\r\nthis pool, and the mark cannot be mistaken. They are captives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter so than left to starve in the wilderness,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nscout; \xe2\x80\x9cand they will leave a wider trail. I would wager fifty beaver\r\nskins against as many flints, that the Mohicans and I enter their wigwams\r\nwithin the month! Stoop to it, Uncas, and try what you can make of the\r\nmoccasin; for moccasin it plainly is, and no shoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Mohican bent over the track, and removing the scattered leaves from\r\naround the place, he examined it with much of that sort of scrutiny that a\r\nmoney dealer, in these days of pecuniary doubts, would bestow on a suspected\r\ndue-bill. At length he arose from his knees, satisfied with the result of the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the attentive scout; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does it say?\r\nCan you make anything of the tell-tale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the attentive scout;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat does it say? Can you make anything of the tell-tale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Renard Subtil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! that rampaging devil again! there will never be an end of his loping\r\ntill \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 has said a friendly word to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward reluctantly admitted the truth of this intelligence, and now expressed\r\nrather his hopes than his doubts by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moccasin is so much like another, it is probable there is some\r\nmistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moccasin like another! you may as well say that one foot is like\r\nanother; though we all know that some are long, and others short; some broad\r\nand others narrow; some with high, and some with low insteps; some intoed, and\r\nsome out. One moccasin is no more like another than one book is like another:\r\nthough they who can read in one are seldom able to tell the marks of the other.\r\nWhich is all ordered for the best, giving to every man his natural advantages.\r\nLet me get down to it, Uncas; neither book nor moccasin is the worse for having\r\ntwo opinions, instead of one.\xe2\x80\x9d The scout stooped to the task, and\r\ninstantly added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, boy; here is the patch we saw so often in the other\r\nchase. And the fellow will drink when he can get an opportunity; your drinking\r\nIndian always learns to walk with a wider toe than the natural savage, it being\r\nthe gift of a drunkard to straddle, whether of white or red skin. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\njust the length and breadth, too! look at it, Sagamore; you measured the prints\r\nmore than once, when we hunted the varmints from Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s to the health\r\nsprings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChingachgook complied; and after finishing his short examination, he arose, and\r\nwith a quiet demeanor, he merely pronounced the word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagua!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, \xe2\x80\x99tis a settled thing; here, then, have passed the dark-hair\r\nand Magua.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not Alice?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her we have not yet seen the signs,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout,\r\nlooking closely around at the trees, the bushes and the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhave we there? Uncas, bring hither the thing you see dangling from yonder\r\nthorn-bush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the Indian had complied, the scout received the prize, and holding it on\r\nhigh, he laughed in his silent but heartfelt manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the tooting we\xe2\x80\x99pon of the singer! now we shall have a\r\ntrail a priest might travel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cUncas, look for the marks\r\nof a shoe that is long enough to uphold six feet two of tottering human flesh.\r\nI begin to have some hopes of the fellow, since he has given up squalling to\r\nfollow some better trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least he has been faithful to his trust,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Cora and Alice are not without a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, dropping his rifle, and leaning on it with an\r\nair of visible contempt, \xe2\x80\x9che will do their singing. Can he slay a buck\r\nfor their dinner; journey by the moss on the beeches, or cut the throat of a\r\nHuron? If not, the first catbird[1]\r\nhe meets is the cleverer of the two. Well, boy, any signs of such a\r\nfoundation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nThe powers of the American mocking-bird are generally known. But the true\r\nmocking-bird is not found so far north as the state of New York, where it has,\r\nhowever, two substitutes of inferior excellence, the catbird, so often named by\r\nthe scout, and the bird vulgarly called ground- thresher. Either of these last\r\ntwo birds is superior to the nightingale or the lark, though, in general, the\r\nAmerican birds are less musical than those of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is something like the footstep of one who has worn a shoe; can it\r\nbe that of our friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouch the leaves lightly or you\xe2\x80\x99ll disconsart the formation. That!\r\nthat is the print of a foot, but \xe2\x80\x99tis the dark-hair\xe2\x80\x99s; and small it\r\nis, too, for one of such a noble height and grand appearance. The singer would\r\ncover it with his heel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere! let me look on the footsteps of my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Munro,\r\nshoving the bushes aside, and bending fondly over the nearly obliterated\r\nimpression. Though the tread which had left the mark had been light and rapid,\r\nit was still plainly visible. The aged soldier examined it with eyes that grew\r\ndim as he gazed; nor did he rise from this stooping posture until Heyward saw\r\nthat he had watered the trace of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s passage with a scalding\r\ntear. Willing to divert a distress which threatened each moment to break\r\nthrough the restraint of appearances, by giving the veteran something to do,\r\nthe young man said to the scout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we now possess these infallible signs, let us commence our march. A\r\nmoment, at such a time, will appear an age to the captives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the swiftest leaping deer that gives the longest chase,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Hawkeye, without moving his eyes from the different marks that had\r\ncome under his view; \xe2\x80\x9cwe know that the rampaging Huron has passed, and\r\nthe dark-hair, and the singer, but where is she of the yellow locks and blue\r\neyes? Though little, and far from being as bold as her sister, she is fair to\r\nthe view, and pleasant in discourse. Has she no friend, that none care for\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid she should ever want hundreds! Are we not now in her pursuit?\r\nFor one, I will never cease the search till she be found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case we may have to journey by different paths; for here she has\r\nnot passed, light and little as her footsteps would be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward drew back, all his ardor to proceed seeming to vanish on the instant.\r\nWithout attending to this sudden change in the other\xe2\x80\x99s humor, the scout\r\nafter musing a moment continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no woman in this wilderness could leave such a print as that,\r\nbut the dark-hair or her sister. We know that the first has been here, but\r\nwhere are the signs of the other? Let us push deeper on the trail, and if\r\nnothing offers, we must go back to the plain and strike another scent. Move on,\r\nUncas, and keep your eyes on the dried leaves. I will watch the bushes, while\r\nyour father shall run with a low nose to the ground. Move on, friends; the sun\r\nis getting behind the hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing that I can do?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the anxious Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the scout, who, with his red friends, was already\r\nadvancing in the order he had prescribed; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, you can keep in our rear\r\nand be careful not to cross the trail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore they had proceeded many rods, the Indians stopped, and appeared to gaze\r\nat some signs on the earth with more than their usual keenness. Both father and\r\nson spoke quick and loud, now looking at the object of their mutual admiration,\r\nand now regarding each other with the most unequivocal pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have found the little foot!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the scout, moving\r\nforward, without attending further to his own portion of the duty. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhave we here? An ambushment has been planted in the spot! No, by the truest\r\nrifle on the frontiers, here have been them one-sided horses again! Now the\r\nwhole secret is out, and all is plain as the north star at midnight. Yes, here\r\nthey have mounted. There the beasts have been bound to a sapling, in waiting;\r\nand yonder runs the broad path away to the north, in full sweep for the\r\nCanadas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still there are no signs of Alice, of the younger Miss Munro,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Duncan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless the shining bauble Uncas has just lifted from the ground should\r\nprove one. Pass it this way, lad, that we may look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward instantly knew it for a trinket that Alice was fond of wearing, and\r\nwhich he recollected, with the tenacious memory of a lover, to have seen, on\r\nthe fatal morning of the massacre, dangling from the fair neck of his mistress.\r\nHe seized the highly prized jewel; and as he proclaimed the fact, it vanished\r\nfrom the eyes of the wondering scout, who in vain looked for it on the ground,\r\nlong after it was warmly pressed against the beating heart of Duncan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d said the disappointed Hawkeye, ceasing to rake the leaves\r\nwith the breech of his rifle; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis a certain sign of age, when the\r\nsight begins to weaken. Such a glittering gewgaw, and not to be seen! Well,\r\nwell, I can squint along a clouded barrel yet, and that is enough to settle all\r\ndisputes between me and the Mingoes. I should like to find the thing, too, if\r\nit were only to carry it to the right owner, and that would be bringing the two\r\nends of what I call a long trail together, for by this time the broad St.\r\nLawrence, or perhaps, the Great Lakes themselves, are between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the more reason why we should not delay our march,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9clet us proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung blood and hot blood, they say, are much the same thing. We are not\r\nabout to start on a squirrel hunt, or to drive a deer into the Horican, but to\r\noutlie for days and nights, and to stretch across a wilderness where the feet\r\nof men seldom go, and where no bookish knowledge would carry you through\r\nharmless. An Indian never starts on such an expedition without smoking over his\r\ncouncil-fire; and, though a man of white blood, I honor their customs in this\r\nparticular, seeing that they are deliberate and wise. We will, therefore, go\r\nback, and light our fire to-night in the ruins of the old fort, and in the\r\nmorning we shall be fresh, and ready to undertake our work like men, and not\r\nlike babbling women or eager boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward saw, by the manner of the scout, that altercation would be useless.\r\nMunro had again sunk into that sort of apathy which had beset him since his\r\nlate overwhelming misfortunes, and from which he was apparently to be roused\r\nonly by some new and powerful excitement. Making a merit of necessity, the\r\nyoung man took the veteran by the arm, and followed in the footsteps of the\r\nIndians and the scout, who had already begun to retrace the path which\r\nconducted them to the plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSalar.\xe2\x80\x94Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his\r\nflesh; what\xe2\x80\x99s that good for?\r\nShy.\xe2\x80\x94To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my\r\nrevenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shades of evening had come to increase the dreariness of the place, when\r\nthe party entered the ruins of William Henry. The scout and his companions\r\nimmediately made their preparations to pass the night there; but with an\r\nearnestness and sobriety of demeanor that betrayed how much the unusual horrors\r\nthey had just witnessed worked on even their practised feelings. A few\r\nfragments of rafters were reared against a blackened wall; and when Uncas had\r\ncovered them slightly with brush, the temporary accommodations were deemed\r\nsufficient. The young Indian pointed toward his rude hut when his labor was\r\nended; and Heyward, who understood the meaning of the silent gestures, gently\r\nurged Munro to enter. Leaving the bereaved old man alone with his sorrows,\r\nDuncan immediately returned into the open air, too much excited himself to seek\r\nthe repose he had recommended to his veteran friend.\r\n\r\nWhile Hawkeye and the Indians lighted their fire and took their evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrepast, a frugal meal of dried bear\xe2\x80\x99s meat, the young man paid a visit to\r\nthat curtain of the dilapidated fort which looked out on the sheet of the\r\nHorican. The wind had fallen, and the waves were already rolling on the sandy\r\nbeach beneath him, in a more regular and tempered succession. The clouds, as if\r\ntired of their furious chase, were breaking asunder; the heavier volumes,\r\ngathering in black masses about the horizon, while the lighter scud still\r\nhurried above the water, or eddied among the tops of the mountains, like broken\r\nflights of birds, hovering around their roosts. Here and there, a red and fiery\r\nstar struggled through the drifting vapor, furnishing a lurid gleam of\r\nbrightness to the dull aspect of the heavens. Within the bosom of the\r\nencircling hills, an impenetrable darkness had already settled; and the plain\r\nlay like a vast and deserted charnel-house, without omen or whisper to disturb\r\nthe slumbers of its numerous and hapless tenants.\r\n\r\nOf this scene, so chillingly in accordance with the past, Duncan stood for many\r\nminutes a rapt observer. His eyes wandered from the bosom of the mound, where\r\nthe foresters were seated around their glimmering fire, to the fainter light\r\nwhich still lingered in the skies, and then rested long and anxiously on the\r\nembodied gloom, which lay like a dreary void on that side of him where the dead\r\nreposed. He soon fancied that inexplicable sounds arose from the place, though\r\nso indistinct and stolen, as to render not only their nature but even their\r\nexistence uncertain. Ashamed of his apprehensions, the young man turned toward\r\nthe water, and strove to divert his attention to the mimic stars that dimly\r\nglimmered on its moving surface. Still, his too-conscious ears performed their\r\nungrateful duty, as if to warn him of some lurking danger. At length, a swift\r\ntrampling seemed, quite audibly, to rush athwart the darkness. Unable any\r\nlonger to quiet his uneasiness, Duncan spoke in a low voice to the scout,\r\nrequesting him to ascend the mound to the place where he stood. Hawkeye threw\r\nhis rifle across an arm and complied, but with an air so unmoved and calm, as\r\nto prove how much he counted on the security of their position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, when the other placed himself deliberately\r\nat his elbow; \xe2\x80\x9cthere are suppressed noises on the plain which may show\r\nMontcalm has not yet entirely deserted his conquest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen ears are better than eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undisturbed scout, who,\r\nhaving just deposited a portion of a bear between his grinders, spoke thick and\r\nslow, like one whose mouth was doubly occupied. \xe2\x80\x9cI myself saw him caged\r\nin Ty, with all his host; for your Frenchers, when they have done a clever\r\nthing, like to get back, and have a dance, or a merry-making, with the women\r\nover their success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not. An Indian seldom sleeps in war, and plunder may keep a Huron\r\nhere after his tribe has departed. It would be well to extinguish the fire, and\r\nhave a watch\xe2\x80\x94listen! you hear the noise I mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn Indian more rarely lurks about the graves. Though ready to slay, and\r\nnot over regardful of the means, he is commonly content with the scalp, unless\r\nwhen blood is hot, and temper up; but after spirit is once fairly gone, he\r\nforgets his enmity, and is willing to let the dead find their natural rest.\r\nSpeaking of spirits, major, are you of opinion that the heaven of a red-skin\r\nand of us whites will be of one and the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt\xe2\x80\x94no doubt. I thought I heard it again! or was it the\r\nrustling of the leaves in the top of the beech?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my own part,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hawkeye, turning his face for a moment\r\nin the direction indicated by Heyward, but with a vacant and careless manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that paradise is ordained for happiness; and that men will be\r\nindulged in it according to their dispositions and gifts. I, therefore, judge\r\nthat a red-skin is not far from the truth when he believes he is to find them\r\nglorious hunting grounds of which his traditions tell; nor, for that matter, do\r\nI think it would be any disparagement to a man without a cross to pass his\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear it again?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Duncan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay; when food is scarce, and when food is plenty, a wolf grows\r\nbold,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unmoved scout. \xe2\x80\x9cThere would be picking, too, among\r\nthe skins of the devils, if there was light and time for the sport. But,\r\nconcerning the life that is to come, major; I have heard preachers say, in the\r\nsettlements, that heaven was a place of rest. Now, men\xe2\x80\x99s minds differ as\r\nto their ideas of enjoyment. For myself, and I say it with reverence to the\r\nordering of Providence, it would be no great indulgence to be kept shut up in\r\nthose mansions of which they preach, having a natural longing for motion and\r\nthe chase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, who was now made to understand the nature of the noise he had heard,\r\nanswered, with more attention to the subject which the humor of the scout had\r\nchosen for discussion, by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to account for the feelings that may attend the last\r\ngreat change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a change, indeed, for a man who has passed his days in the\r\nopen air,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the single-minded scout; \xe2\x80\x9cand who has so often\r\nbroken his fast on the head waters of the Hudson, to sleep within sound of the\r\nroaring Mohawk. But it is a comfort to know we serve a merciful Master, though\r\nwe do it each after his fashion, and with great tracts of wilderness atween\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94what goes there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not the rushing of the wolves you have mentioned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye slowly shook his head, and beckoned for Duncan to follow him to a spot\r\nto which the glare from the fire did not extend. When he had taken this\r\nprecaution, the scout placed himself in an attitude of intense attention and\r\nlistened long and keenly for a repetition of the low sound that had so\r\nunexpectedly startled him. His vigilance, however, seemed exercised in vain;\r\nfor after a fruitless pause, he whispered to Duncan:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must give a call to Uncas. The boy has Indian senses, and he may hear\r\nwhat is hid from us; for, being a white-skin, I will not deny my nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Mohican, who was conversing in a low voice with his father, started\r\nas he heard the moaning of an owl, and, springing on his feet, he looked toward\r\nthe black mounds, as if seeking the place whence the sounds proceeded. The\r\nscout repeated the call, and in a few moments, Duncan saw the figure of Uncas\r\nstealing cautiously along the rampart, to the spot where they stood.\r\n\r\nHawkeye explained his wishes in a very few words, which were spoken in the\r\nDelaware tongue. So soon as Uncas was in possession of the reason why he was\r\nsummoned, he threw himself flat on the turf; where, to the eyes of Duncan, he\r\nappeared to lie quiet and motionless. Surprised at the immovable attitude of\r\nthe young warrior, and curious to observe the manner in which he employed his\r\nfaculties to obtain the desired information, Heyward advanced a few steps, and\r\nbent over the dark object on which he had kept his eye riveted. Then it was he\r\ndiscovered that the form of Uncas vanished, and that he beheld only the dark\r\noutline of an inequality in the embankment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of the Mohican?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded of the scout,\r\nstepping back in amazement; \xe2\x80\x9cit was here that I saw him fall, and could\r\nhave sworn that here he yet remained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist! speak lower; for we know not what ears are open, and the Mingoes\r\nare a quick-witted breed. As for Uncas, he is out on the plain, and the Maquas,\r\nif any such are about us, will find their equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think that Montcalm has not called off all his Indians? Let us give\r\nthe alarm to our companions, that we may stand to our arms. Here are five of\r\nus, who are not unused to meet an enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word to either, as you value your life. Look at the Sagamore, how\r\nlike a grand Indian chief he sits by the fire. If there are any skulkers out in\r\nthe darkness, they will never discover, by his countenance, that we suspect\r\ndanger at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they may discover him, and it will prove his death. His person can\r\nbe too plainly seen by the light of that fire, and he will become the first and\r\nmost certain victim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is undeniable that now you speak the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nscout, betraying more anxiety than was usual; \xe2\x80\x9cyet what can be done? A\r\nsingle suspicious look might bring on an attack before we are ready to receive\r\nit. He knows, by the call I gave to Uncas, that we have struck a scent; I will\r\ntell him that we are on the trail of the Mingoes; his Indian nature will teach\r\nhim how to act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout applied his fingers to his mouth, and raised a low hissing sound,\r\nthat caused Duncan at first to start aside, believing that he heard a serpent.\r\nThe head of Chingachgook was resting on a hand, as he sat musing by himself but\r\nthe moment he had heard the warning of the animal whose name he bore, he arose\r\nto an upright position, and his dark eyes glanced swiftly and keenly on every\r\nside of him. With his sudden and, perhaps, involuntary movement, every\r\nappearance of surprise or alarm ended. His rifle lay untouched, and apparently\r\nunnoticed, within reach of his hand. The tomahawk that he had loosened in his\r\nbelt for the sake of ease, was even suffered to fall from its usual situation\r\nto the ground, and his form seemed to sink, like that of a man whose nerves and\r\nsinews were suffered to relax for the purpose of rest. Cunningly resuming his\r\nformer position, though with a change of hands, as if the movement had been\r\nmade merely to relieve the limb, the native awaited the result with a calmness\r\nand fortitude that none but an Indian warrior would have known how to exercise.\r\n\r\nBut Heyward saw that while to a less instructed eye the Mohican chief appeared\r\nto slumber, his nostrils were expanded, his head was turned a little to one\r\nside, as if to assist the organs of hearing, and that his quick and rapid\r\nglances ran incessantly over every object within the power of his vision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee the noble fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Hawkeye, pressing the arm of\r\nHeyward; \xe2\x80\x9che knows that a look or a motion might disconsart our schemes,\r\nand put us at the mercy of them imps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by the flash and report of a rifle. The air was filled with\r\nsparks of fire, around that spot where the eyes of Heyward were still fastened,\r\nwith admiration and wonder. A second look told him that Chingachgook had\r\ndisappeared in the confusion. In the meantime, the scout had thrown forward his\r\nrifle, like one prepared for service, and awaited impatiently the moment when\r\nan enemy might rise to view. But with the solitary and fruitless attempt made\r\non the life of Chingachgook, the attack appeared to have terminated. Once or\r\ntwice the listeners thought they could distinguish the distant rustling of\r\nbushes, as bodies of some unknown description rushed through them; nor was it\r\nlong before Hawkeye pointed out the \xe2\x80\x9cscampering of the wolves,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nthey fled precipitately before the passage of some intruder on their proper\r\ndomains. After an impatient and breathless pause, a plunge was heard in the\r\nwater, and it was immediately followed by the report of another rifle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere goes Uncas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cthe boy bears a smart\r\npiece! I know its crack, as well as a father knows the language of his child,\r\nfor I carried the gun myself until a better offered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Duncan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are watched, and,\r\nas it would seem, marked for destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder scattered brand can witness that no good was intended, and this\r\nIndian will testify that no harm has been done,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout,\r\ndropping his rifle across his arm again, and following Chingachgook, who just\r\nthen reappeared within the circle of light, into the bosom of the work.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it, Sagamore? Are the Mingoes upon us in earnest, or is it only\r\none of those reptiles who hang upon the skirts of a war-party, to scalp the\r\ndead, go in, and make their boast among the squaws of the valiant deeds done on\r\nthe pale faces?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChingachgook very quietly resumed his seat; nor did he make any reply, until\r\nafter he had examined the firebrand which had been struck by the bullet that\r\nhad nearly proved fatal to himself. After which he was content to reply,\r\nholding a single finger up to view, with the English monosyllable:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hawkeye, seating himself; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nas he had got the cover of the lake afore Uncas pulled upon him, it is more\r\nthan probable the knave will sing his lies about some great ambushment, in\r\nwhich he was outlying on the trail of two Mohicans and a white hunter\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe officers can be considered as little better than idlers in such a\r\nscrimmage. Well, let him\xe2\x80\x94let him. There are always some honest men in\r\nevery nation, though heaven knows, too, that they are scarce among the Maquas,\r\nto look down an upstart when he brags ag\xe2\x80\x99in the face of reason. The\r\nvarlet sent his lead within whistle of your ears, Sagamore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChingachgook turned a calm and incurious eye toward the place where the ball\r\nhad struck, and then resumed his former attitude, with a composure that could\r\nnot be disturbed by so trifling an incident. Just then Uncas glided into the\r\ncircle, and seated himself at the fire, with the same appearance of\r\nindifference as was maintained by his father.\r\n\r\nOf these several moments Heyward was a deeply interested and wondering\r\nobserver. It appeared to him as though the foresters had some secret means of\r\nintelligence, which had escaped the vigilance of his own faculties. In place of\r\nthat eager and garrulous narration with which a white youth would have\r\nendeavored to communicate, and perhaps exaggerate, that which had passed out in\r\nthe darkness of the plain, the young warrior was seemingly content to let his\r\ndeeds speak for themselves. It was, in fact, neither the moment nor the\r\noccasion for an Indian to boast of his exploits; and it is probably that, had\r\nHeyward neglected to inquire, not another syllable would, just then, have been\r\nuttered on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of our enemy, Uncas?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nheard your rifle, and hoped you had not fired in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young chief removed a fold of his hunting skirt, and quietly exposed the\r\nfatal tuft of hair, which he bore as the symbol of victory. Chingachgook laid\r\nhis hand on the scalp, and considered it for a moment with deep attention. Then\r\ndropping it, with disgust depicted in his strong features, he ejaculated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOneida!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOneida!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the scout, who was fast losing his interest in\r\nthe scene, in an apathy nearly assimilated to that of his red associates, but\r\nwho now advanced in uncommon earnestness to regard the bloody badge. \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nthe Lord, if the Oneidas are outlying upon the trail, we shall by flanked by\r\ndevils on every side of us! Now, to white eyes there is no difference between\r\nthis bit of skin and that of any other Indian, and yet the Sagamore declares it\r\ncame from the poll of a Mingo; nay, he even names the tribe of the poor devil,\r\nwith as much ease as if the scalp was the leaf of a book, and each hair a\r\nletter. What right have Christian whites to boast of their learning, when a\r\nsavage can read a language that would prove too much for the wisest of them\r\nall! What say you, lad, of what people was the knave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas raised his eyes to the face of the scout, and answered, in his soft\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOneida.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOneida, again! when one Indian makes a declaration it is commonly true;\r\nbut when he is supported by his people, set it down as gospel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor fellow has mistaken us for French,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor he would not have attempted the life of a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe mistake a Mohican in his paint for a Huron! You would be as likely to\r\nmistake the white-coated grenadiers of Montcalm for the scarlet jackets of the\r\nRoyal Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, the sarpent knew his\r\nerrand; nor was there any great mistake in the matter, for there is but little\r\nlove atween a Delaware and a Mingo, let their tribes go out to fight for whom\r\nthey may, in a white quarrel. For that matter, though the Oneidas do serve his\r\nsacred majesty, who is my sovereign lord and master, I should not have\r\ndeliberated long about letting off \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 at the imp myself,\r\nhad luck thrown him in my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would have been an abuse of our treaties, and unworthy of your\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a man consort much with a people,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hawkeye,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif they were honest and he no knave, love will grow up atwixt them. It\r\nis true that white cunning has managed to throw the tribes into great\r\nconfusion, as respects friends and enemies; so that the Hurons and the Oneidas,\r\nwho speak the same tongue, or what may be called the same, take each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s scalps, and the Delawares are divided among themselves; a few\r\nhanging about their great council-fire on their own river, and fighting on the\r\nsame side with the Mingoes while the greater part are in the Canadas, out of\r\nnatural enmity to the Maquas\xe2\x80\x94thus throwing everything into disorder, and\r\ndestroying all the harmony of warfare. Yet a red natur\xe2\x80\x99 is not likely to\r\nalter with every shift of policy; so that the love atwixt a Mohican and a Mingo\r\nis much like the regard between a white man and a sarpent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI regret to hear it; for I had believed those natives who dwelt within\r\nour boundaries had found us too just and liberal, not to identify themselves\r\nfully with our quarrels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I believe it is natur\xe2\x80\x99 to give a preference to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown quarrels before those of strangers. Now, for myself, I do love justice;\r\nand, therefore, I will not say I hate a Mingo, for that may be unsuitable to my\r\ncolor and my religion, though I will just repeat, it may have been owing to the\r\nnight that \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 had no hand in the death of this skulking\r\nOneida.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as if satisfied with the force of his own reasons, whatever might be\r\ntheir effect on the opinions of the other disputant, the honest but implacable\r\nwoodsman turned from the fire, content to let the controversy slumber. Heyward\r\nwithdrew to the rampart, too uneasy and too little accustomed to the warfare of\r\nthe woods to remain at ease under the possibility of such insidious attacks.\r\nNot so, however, with the scout and the Mohicans. Those acute and\r\nlong-practised senses, whose powers so often exceed the limits of all ordinary\r\ncredulity, after having detected the danger, had enabled them to ascertain its\r\nmagnitude and duration. Not one of the three appeared in the least to doubt\r\ntheir perfect security, as was indicated by the preparations that were soon\r\nmade to sit in council over their future proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe confusion of nations, and even of tribes, to which Hawkeye alluded, existed\r\nat that period in the fullest force. The great tie of language, and, of course,\r\nof a common origin, was severed in many places; and it was one of its\r\nconsequences, that the Delaware and the Mingo (as the people of the Six Nations\r\nwere called) were found fighting in the same ranks, while the latter sought the\r\nscalp of the Huron, though believed to be the root of his own stock. The\r\nDelawares were even divided among themselves. Though love for the soil which\r\nhad belonged to his ancestors kept the Sagamore of the Mohicans with a small\r\nband of followers who were serving at Edward, under the banners of the English\r\nking, by far the largest portion of his nation were known to be in the field as\r\nallies of Montcalm. The reader probably knows, if enough has not already been\r\ngleaned form this narrative, that the Delaware, or Lenape, claimed to be the\r\nprogenitors of that numerous people, who once were masters of most of the\r\neastern and northern states of America, of whom the community of the Mohicans\r\nwas an ancient and highly honored member.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, with a perfect understanding of the minute and intricate\r\ninterests which had armed friend against friend, and brought natural enemies to\r\ncombat by each other\xe2\x80\x99s side, that the scout and his companions now\r\ndisposed themselves to deliberate on the measures that were to govern their\r\nfuture movements, amid so many jarring and savage races of men. Duncan knew\r\nenough of Indian customs to understand the reason that the fire was\r\nreplenished, and why the warriors, not excepting Hawkeye, took their seats\r\nwithin the curl of its smoke with so much gravity and decorum. Placing himself\r\nat an angle of the works, where he might be a spectator of the scene without,\r\nhe awaited the result with as much patience as he could summon.\r\n\r\nAfter a short and impressive pause, Chingachgook lighted a pipe whose bowl was\r\ncuriously carved in one of the soft stones of the country, and whose stem was a\r\ntube of wood, and commenced smoking. When he had inhaled enough of the\r\nfragrance of the soothing weed, he passed the instrument into the hands of the\r\nscout. In this manner the pipe had made its rounds three several times, amid\r\nthe most profound silence, before either of the party opened his lips. Then the\r\nSagamore, as the oldest and highest in rank, in a few calm and dignified words,\r\nproposed the subject for deliberation. He was answered by the scout; and\r\nChingachgook rejoined, when the other objected to his opinions. But the\r\nyouthful Uncas continued a silent and respectful listener, until Hawkeye, in\r\ncomplaisance, demanded his opinion. Heyward gathered from the manners of the\r\ndifferent speakers, that the father and son espoused one side of a disputed\r\nquestion, while the white man maintained the other. The contest gradually grew\r\nwarmer, until it was quite evident the feelings of the speakers began to be\r\nsomewhat enlisted in the debate.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the increasing warmth of the amicable contest, the most\r\ndecorous Christian assembly, not even excepting those in which its reverend\r\nministers are collected, might have learned a wholesome lesson of moderation\r\nfrom the forbearance and courtesy of the disputants. The words of Uncas were\r\nreceived with the same deep attention as those which fell from the maturer\r\nwisdom of his father; and so far from manifesting any impatience, neither spoke\r\nin reply, until a few moments of silent meditation were, seemingly, bestowed in\r\ndeliberating on what had already been said.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Mohicans was accompanied by gestures so direct and natural\r\nthat Heyward had but little difficulty in following the thread of their\r\nargument. On the other hand, the scout was obscure; because from the lingering\r\npride of color, he rather affected the cold and artificial manner which\r\ncharacterizes all classes of Anglo-Americans when unexcited. By the frequency\r\nwith which the Indians described the marks of a forest trial, it was evident\r\nthey urged a pursuit by land, while the repeated sweep of Hawkeye\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\ntoward the Horican denoted that he was for a passage across its waters.\r\n\r\nThe latter was to every appearance fast losing ground, and the point was about\r\nto be decided against him, when he arose to his feet, and shaking off his\r\napathy, he suddenly assumed the manner of an Indian, and adopted all the arts\r\nof native eloquence. Elevating an arm, he pointed out the track of the sun,\r\nrepeating the gesture for every day that was necessary to accomplish their\r\nobjects. Then he delineated a long and painful path, amid rocks and\r\nwater-courses. The age and weakness of the slumbering and unconscious Munro\r\nwere indicated by signs too palpable to be mistaken. Duncan perceived that even\r\nhis own powers were spoken lightly of, as the scout extended his palm, and\r\nmentioned him by the appellation of the \xe2\x80\x9cOpen Hand\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a name\r\nhis liberality had purchased of all the friendly tribes. Then came a\r\nrepresentation of the light and graceful movements of a canoe, set in forcible\r\ncontrast to the tottering steps of one enfeebled and tired. He concluded by\r\npointing to the scalp of the Oneida, and apparently urging the necessity of\r\ntheir departing speedily, and in a manner that should leave no trail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nThe Mohicans listened gravely, and with countenances that\r\nreflected the\r\nsentiments of the speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mohicans listened gravely, and with countenances that reflected the\r\nsentiments of the speaker. Conviction gradually wrought its influence, and\r\ntoward the close of Hawkeye\xe2\x80\x99s speech, his sentences were accompanied by\r\nthe customary exclamation of commendation. In short, Uncas and his father\r\nbecame converts to his way of thinking, abandoning their own previously\r\nexpressed opinions with a liberality and candor that, had they been the\r\nrepresentatives of some great and civilized people, would have infallibly\r\nworked their political ruin, by destroying forever their reputation for\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe instant the matter in discussion was decided, the debate, and everything\r\nconnected with it, except the result appeared to be forgotten. Hawkeye, without\r\nlooking round to read his triumph in applauding eyes, very composedly stretched\r\nhis tall frame before the dying embers, and closed his own organs in sleep.\r\n\r\nLeft now in a measure to themselves, the Mohicans, whose time had been so much\r\ndevoted to the interests of others, seized the moment to devote some attention\r\nto themselves. Casting off at once the grave and austere demeanor of an Indian\r\nchief, Chingachgook commenced speaking to his son in the soft and playful tones\r\nof affection. Uncas gladly met the familiar air of his father; and before the\r\nhard breathing of the scout announced that he slept, a complete change was\r\neffected in the manner of his two associates.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the music of their language, while thus engaged in\r\nlaughter and endearments, in such a way as to render it intelligible to those\r\nwhose ears have never listened to its melody. The compass of their voices,\r\nparticularly that of the youth, was wonderful\xe2\x80\x94extending from the deepest\r\nbass to tones that were even feminine in softness. The eyes of the father\r\nfollowed the plastic and ingenious movements of the son with open delight, and\r\nhe never failed to smile in reply to the other\xe2\x80\x99s contagious but low\r\nlaughter. While under the influence of these gentle and natural feelings, no\r\ntrace of ferocity was to be seen in the softened features of the Sagamore. His\r\nfigured panoply of death looked more like a disguise assumed in mockery than a\r\nfierce annunciation of a desire to carry destruction in his footsteps.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour had passed in the indulgence of their better feelings,\r\nChingachgook abruptly announced his desire to sleep, by wrapping his head in\r\nhis blanket and stretching his form on the naked earth. The merriment of Uncas\r\ninstantly ceased; and carefully raking the coals in such a manner that they\r\nshould impart their warmth to his father\xe2\x80\x99s feet, the youth sought his own\r\npillow among the ruins of the place.\r\n\r\nImbibing renewed confidence from the security of these experienced foresters,\r\nHeyward soon imitated their example; and long before the night had turned, they\r\nwho lay in the bosom of the ruined work, seemed to slumber as heavily as the\r\nunconscious multitude whose bones were already beginning to bleach on the\r\nsurrounding plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLand of Albania! let me bend mine eyes\r\nOn thee; thou rugged nurse of savage men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Childe Harold\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heavens were still studded with stars, when Hawkeye came to arouse the\r\nsleepers. Casting aside their cloaks Munro and Heyward were on their feet while\r\nthe woodsman was still making his low calls, at the entrance of the rude\r\nshelter where they had passed the night. When they issued from beneath its\r\nconcealment, they found the scout awaiting their appearance nigh by, and the\r\nonly salutation between them was the significant gesture for silence, made by\r\ntheir sagacious leader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink over your prayers,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, as they approached him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor He to whom you make them, knows all tongues; that of the heart, as\r\nwell as those of the mouth. But speak not a syllable; it is rare for a white\r\nvoice to pitch itself properly in the woods, as we have seen by the example of\r\nthat miserable devil, the singer. Come,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, turning toward a\r\ncurtain of the works; \xe2\x80\x9clet us get into the ditch on this side, and be\r\nregardful to step on the stones and fragments of wood as you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companions complied, though to two of them the reasons of this\r\nextraordinary precaution were yet a mystery. When they were in the low cavity\r\nthat surrounded the earthen fort on three sides, they found that passage nearly\r\nchoked by the ruins. With care and patience, however, they succeeded in\r\nclambering after the scout, until they reached the sandy shore of the Horican.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a trail that nothing but a nose can follow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nsatisfied scout, looking back along their difficult way; \xe2\x80\x9cgrass is a\r\ntreacherous carpet for a flying party to tread on, but wood and stone take no\r\nprint from a moccasin. Had you worn your armed boots, there might, indeed, have\r\nbeen something to fear; but with the deer-skin suitably prepared, a man may\r\ntrust himself, generally, on rocks with safety. Shove in the canoe nigher to\r\nthe land, Uncas; this sand will take a stamp as easily as the butter of the\r\nJarmans on the Mohawk. Softly, lad, softly; it must not touch the beach, or the\r\nknaves will know by what road we have left the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man observed the precaution; and the scout, laying a board from the\r\nruins to the canoe, made a sign for the two officers to enter. When this was\r\ndone, everything was studiously restored to its former disorder; and then\r\nHawkeye succeeded in reaching his little birchen vessel, without leaving behind\r\nhim any of those marks which he appeared so much to dread. Heyward was silent\r\nuntil the Indians had cautiously paddled the canoe some distance from the fort,\r\nand within the broad and dark shadows that fell from the eastern mountain on\r\nthe glassy surface of the lake; then he demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat need have we for this stolen and hurried departure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the blood of an Oneida could stain such a sheet of pure water as this\r\nwe float on,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, \xe2\x80\x9cyour two eyes would answer your\r\nown question. Have you forgotten the skulking reptile Uncas slew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means. But he was said to be alone, and dead men give no cause for\r\nfear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, he was alone in his deviltry! but an Indian whose tribe counts so\r\nmany warriors, need seldom fear his blood will run without the death shriek\r\ncoming speedily from some of his enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut our presence\xe2\x80\x94the authority of Colonel Munro\xe2\x80\x94would prove\r\nsufficient protection against the anger of our allies, especially in a case\r\nwhere the wretch so well merited his fate. I trust in Heaven you have not\r\ndeviated a single foot from the direct line of our course with so slight a\r\nreason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the bullet of that varlet\xe2\x80\x99s rifle would have turned\r\naside, though his sacred majesty the king had stood in its path?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the stubborn scout. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did not the grand Frencher, he who is\r\ncaptain-general of the Canadas, bury the tomahawks of the Hurons, if a word\r\nfrom a white can work so strongly on the natur\xe2\x80\x99 of an Indian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reply of Heyward was interrupted by a groan from Munro; but after he had\r\npaused a moment, in deference to the sorrow of his aged friend he resumed the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe marquis of Montcalm can only settle that error with his God,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the young man solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, now there is reason in your words, for they are bottomed on\r\nreligion and honesty. There is a vast difference between throwing a regiment of\r\nwhite coats atwixt the tribes and the prisoners, and coaxing an angry savage to\r\nforget he carries a knife and rifle, with words that must begin with calling\r\nhim your son. No, no,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the scout, looking back at the dim shore\r\nof William Henry, which was now fast receding, and laughing in his own silent\r\nbut heartfelt manner; \xe2\x80\x9cI have put a trail of water atween us; and unless\r\nthe imps can make friends with the fishes, and hear who has paddled across\r\ntheir basin this fine morning, we shall throw the length of the Horican behind\r\nus before they have made up their minds which path to take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith foes in front, and foes in our rear, our journey is like to be one\r\nof danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDanger!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Hawkeye, calmly; \xe2\x80\x9cno, not absolutely of\r\ndanger; for, with vigilant ears and quick eyes, we can manage to keep a few\r\nhours ahead of the knaves; or, if we must try the rifle, there are three of us\r\nwho understand its gifts as well as any you can name on the borders. No, not of\r\ndanger; but that we shall have what you may call a brisk push of it, is\r\nprobable; and it may happen, a brush, a scrimmage, or some such divarsion, but\r\nalways where covers are good, and ammunition abundant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Heyward\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of danger differed in some degree\r\nfrom that of the scout, for, instead of replying, he now sat in silence, while\r\nthe canoe glided over several miles of water. Just as the day dawned, they\r\nentered the narrows of the lake[1],\r\nand stole swiftly and cautiously among their numberless little islands. It was\r\nby this road that Montcalm had retired with his army, and the adventurers knew\r\nnot but he had left some of his Indians in ambush, to protect the rear of his\r\nforces, and collect the stragglers. They, therefore, approached the passage\r\nwith the customary silence of their guarded habits.\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nThe beauties of Lake George are well known to every American tourist. In the\r\nheight of the mountains which surround it, and in artificial accessories, it is\r\ninferior to the finest of the Swiss and Italian lakes, while in outline and\r\npurity of water it is fully their equal; and in the number and disposition of\r\nits isles and islets much superior to them all together. There are said to be\r\nsome hundreds of islands in a sheet of water less than thirty miles long. The\r\nnarrows, which connect what may be called, in truth, two lakes, are crowded\r\nwith islands to such a degree as to leave passages between them frequently of\r\nonly a few feet in width. The lake itself varies in breadth from one to three\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nChingachgook laid aside his paddle; while Uncas and the scout urged the light\r\nvessel through crooked and intricate channels, where every foot that they\r\nadvanced exposed them to the danger of some sudden rising on their progress.\r\nThe eyes of the Sagamore moved warily from islet to islet, and copse to copse,\r\nas the canoe proceeded; and, when a clearer sheet of water permitted, his keen\r\nvision was bent along the bald rocks and impending forests that frowned upon\r\nthe narrow strait.\r\n\r\nHeyward, who was a doubly interested spectator, as well from the beauties of\r\nthe place as from the apprehension natural to his situation, was just believing\r\nthat he had permitted the latter to be excited without sufficient reason, when\r\nthe paddle ceased moving, in obedience to a signal from Chingachgook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Uncas, nearly at the moment that the light tap\r\nhis father had made on the side of the canoe notified them of the vicinity of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cthe lake is as smooth as if the\r\nwinds had never blown, and I can see along its sheet for miles; there is not so\r\nmuch as the black head of a loon dotting the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian gravely raised his paddle, and pointed in the direction in which his\r\nown steady look was riveted. Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed the motion. A few\r\nrods in their front lay another of the wooded islets, but it appeared as calm\r\nand peaceful as if its solitude had never been disturbed by the foot of man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut land and water; and a lovely\r\nscene it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, Sagamore, there is always\r\na reason for what you do. \xe2\x80\x99Tis but a shade, and yet it is not natural.\r\nYou see the mist, major, that is rising above the island; you can\xe2\x80\x99t call\r\nit a fog, for it is more like a streak of thin cloud\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is vapor from the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat a child could tell. But what is the edging of blacker smoke that\r\nhangs along its lower side, and which you may trace down into the thicket of\r\nhazel? \xe2\x80\x99Tis from a fire; but one that, in my judgment, has been suffered\r\nto burn low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us, then, push for the place, and relieve our doubts,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe impatient Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cthe party must be small that can lie on such a bit\r\nof land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you judge of Indian cunning by the rules you find in books, or by\r\nwhite sagacity, they will lead you astray, if not to your death,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Hawkeye, examining the signs of the place with that acuteness which\r\ndistinguished him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I may be permitted to speak in this matter, it\r\nwill be to say, that we have but two things to choose between: the one is, to\r\nreturn, and give up all thoughts of following the Hurons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Heyward, in a voice far too loud for their\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hawkeye, making a hasty sign to repress his\r\nimpatience; \xe2\x80\x9cI am much of your mind myself; though I thought it becoming\r\nmy experience to tell the whole. We must, then, make a push, and if the Indians\r\nor Frenchers are in the narrows, run the gauntlet through these toppling\r\nmountains. Is there reason in my words, Sagamore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian made no other answer than by dropping his paddle into the water, and\r\nurging forward the canoe. As he held the office of directing its course, his\r\nresolution was sufficiently indicated by the movement. The whole party now\r\nplied their paddles vigorously, and in a very few moments they had reached a\r\npoint whence they might command an entire view of the northern shore of the\r\nisland, the side that had hitherto been concealed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are, by all the truth of signs,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the scout,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctwo canoes and a smoke. The knaves haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet got their eyes out\r\nof the mist, or we should hear the accursed whoop. Together, friends! we are\r\nleaving them, and are already nearly out of whistle of a bullet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe well-known crack of a rifle, whose ball came skipping along the placid\r\nsurface of the strait, and a shrill yell from the island, interrupted his\r\nspeech, and announced that their passage was discovered. In another instant\r\nseveral savages were seen rushing into canoes, which were soon dancing over the\r\nwater in pursuit. These fearful precursors of a coming struggle produced no\r\nchange in the countenances and movements of his three guides, so far as Duncan\r\ncould discover, except that the strokes of their paddles were longer and more\r\nin unison, and caused the little bark to spring forward like a creature\r\npossessing life and volition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold them there, Sagamore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, looking coolly backward\r\nover this left shoulder, while he still plied his paddle; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep them just\r\nthere. Them Hurons have never a piece in their nation that will execute at this\r\ndistance; but \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 has a barrel on which a man may\r\ncalculate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe scout having ascertained that the Mohicans were sufficient of themselves to\r\nmaintain the requisite distance, deliberately laid aside his paddle, and raised\r\nthe fatal rifle. Three several times he brought the piece to his shoulder, and\r\nwhen his companions were expecting its report, he as often lowered it to\r\nrequest the Indians would permit their enemies to approach a little nigher. At\r\nlength his accurate and fastidious eye seemed satisfied, and, throwing out his\r\nleft arm on the barrel, he was slowly elevating the muzzle, when an exclamation\r\nfrom Uncas, who sat in the bow, once more caused him to suspend the shot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, now, lad?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Hawkeye; \xe2\x80\x9cyou save a Huron from\r\nthe death-shriek by that word; have you reason for what you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas pointed toward a rocky shore a little in their front, whence another war\r\ncanoe was darting directly across their course. It was too obvious now that\r\ntheir situation was imminently perilous to need the aid of language to confirm\r\nit. The scout laid aside his rifle, and resumed the paddle, while Chingachgook\r\ninclined the bows of the canoe a little toward the western shore, in order to\r\nincrease the distance between them and this new enemy. In the meantime they\r\nwere reminded of the presence of those who pressed upon their rear, by wild and\r\nexulting shouts. The stirring scene awakened even Munro from his apathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us make for the rocks on the main,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the mien of\r\na tired soldier, \xe2\x80\x9cand give battle to the savages. God forbid that I, or\r\nthose attached to me and mine, should ever trust again to the faith of any\r\nservant of the Louis\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe who wishes to prosper in Indian warfare,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmust not be too proud to learn from the wit of a native. Lay her more\r\nalong the land, Sagamore; we are doubling on the varlets, and perhaps they may\r\ntry to strike our trail on the long calculation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye was not mistaken; for when the Hurons found their course was likely to\r\nthrow them behind their chase they rendered it less direct, until, by gradually\r\nbearing more and more obliquely, the two canoes were, ere long, gliding on\r\nparallel lines, within two hundred yards of each other. It now became entirely\r\na trial of speed. So rapid was the progress of the light vessels, that the lake\r\ncurled in their front, in miniature waves, and their motion became undulating\r\nby its own velocity. It was, perhaps, owing to this circumstance, in addition\r\nto the necessity of keeping every hand employed at the paddles, that the Hurons\r\nhad not immediate recourse to their firearms. The exertions of the fugitives\r\nwere too severe to continue long, and the pursuers had the advantage of\r\nnumbers. Duncan observed with uneasiness, that the scout began to look\r\nanxiously about him, as if searching for some further means of assisting their\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdge her a little more from the sun, Sagamore,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stubborn\r\nwoodsman; \xe2\x80\x9cI see the knaves are sparing a man to the rifle. A single\r\nbroken bone might lose us our scalps. Edge more from the sun and we will put\r\nthe island between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expedient was not without its use. A long, low island lay at a little\r\ndistance before them, and, as they closed with it, the chasing canoe was\r\ncompelled to take a side opposite to that on which the pursued passed. The\r\nscout and his companions did not neglect this advantage, but the instant they\r\nwere hid from observation by the bushes, they redoubled efforts that before had\r\nseemed prodigious. The two canoes came round the last low point, like two\r\ncoursers at the top of their speed, the fugitives taking the lead. This change\r\nhad brought them nigher to each other, however, while it altered their relative\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou showed knowledge in the shaping of a birchen bark, Uncas, when you\r\nchose this from among the Huron canoes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, smiling,\r\napparently more in satisfaction at their superiority in the race than from that\r\nprospect of final escape which now began to open a little upon them. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nimps have put all their strength again at the paddles, and we are to struggle\r\nfor our scalps with bits of flattened wood, instead of clouded barrels and true\r\neyes. A long stroke, and together, friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are preparing for a shot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cand as we are\r\nin a line with them, it can scarcely fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet you, then, into the bottom of the canoe,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou and the colonel; it will be so much taken from the size of the\r\nmark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward smiled, as he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be but an ill example for the highest in rank to dodge, while\r\nthe warriors were under fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord! Lord! That is now a white man\xe2\x80\x99s courage!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nthe scout; \xe2\x80\x9cand like to many of his notions, not to be maintained by\r\nreason. Do you think the Sagamore, or Uncas, or even I, who am a man without a\r\ncross, would deliberate about finding a cover in the scrimmage, when an open\r\nbody would do no good? For what have the Frenchers reared up their Quebec, if\r\nfighting is always to be done in the clearings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that you say is very true, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Heyward;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstill, our customs must prevent us from doing as you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA volley from the Hurons interrupted the discourse, and as the bullets whistled\r\nabout them, Duncan saw the head of Uncas turned, looking back at himself and\r\nMunro. Notwithstanding the nearness of the enemy, and his own great personal\r\ndanger, the countenance of the young warrior expressed no other emotion, as the\r\nformer was compelled to think, than amazement at finding men willing to\r\nencounter so useless an exposure. Chingachgook was probably better acquainted\r\nwith the notions of white men, for he did not even cast a glance aside from the\r\nriveted look his eye maintained on the object by which he governed their\r\ncourse. A ball soon struck the light and polished paddle from the hands of the\r\nchief, and drove it through the air, far in the advance. A shout arose from the\r\nHurons, who seized the opportunity to fire another volley. Uncas described an\r\narc in the water with his own blade, and as the canoe passed swiftly on,\r\nChingachgook recovered his paddle, and flourishing it on high, he gave the\r\nwar-whoop of the Mohicans, and then lent his strength and skill again to the\r\nimportant task.\r\n\r\nThe clamorous sounds of \xe2\x80\x9cLe Gros Serpent!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue\r\nCarabine!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLe Cerf Agile!\xe2\x80\x9d burst at once from the canoes\r\nbehind, and seemed to give new zeal to the pursuers. The scout seized\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckilldeer\xe2\x80\x9d in his left hand, and elevating it about his head, he\r\nshook it in triumph at his enemies. The savages answered the insult with a\r\nyell, and immediately another volley succeeded. The bullets pattered along the\r\nlake, and one even pierced the bark of their little vessel. No perceptible\r\nemotion could be discovered in the Mohicans during this critical moment, their\r\nrigid features expressing neither hope nor alarm; but the scout again turned\r\nhis head, and, laughing in his own silent manner, he said to Heyward:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe knaves love to hear the sounds of their pieces; but the eye is not\r\nto be found among the Mingoes that can calculate a true range in a dancing\r\ncanoe! You see the dumb devils have taken off a man to charge, and by the\r\nsmallest measurement that can be allowed, we move three feet to their\r\ntwo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, who was not altogether as easy under this nice estimate of distances as\r\nhis companions, was glad to find, however, that owing to their superior\r\ndexterity, and the diversion among their enemies, they were very sensibly\r\nobtaining the advantage. The Hurons soon fired again, and a bullet struck the\r\nblade of Hawkeye\xe2\x80\x99s paddle without injury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, examining the slight indentation\r\nwith a curious eye; \xe2\x80\x9cit would not have cut the skin of an infant, much\r\nless of men, who, like us, have been blown upon by the heavens in their anger.\r\nNow, major, if you will try to use this piece of flattened wood, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let\r\n\xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 take a part in the conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward seized the paddle, and applied himself to the work with an eagerness\r\nthat supplied the place of skill, while Hawkeye was engaged in inspecting the\r\npriming of his rifle. The latter then took a swift aim and fired. The Huron in\r\nthe bows of the leading canoe had risen with a similar object, and he now fell\r\nbackward, suffering his gun to escape from his hands into the water. In an\r\ninstant, however, he recovered his feet, though his gestures were wild and\r\nbewildered. At the same moment his companions suspended their efforts, and the\r\nchasing canoes clustered together, and became stationary. Chingachgook and\r\nUncas profited by the interval to regain their wind, though Duncan continued to\r\nwork with the most persevering industry. The father and son now cast calm but\r\ninquiring glances at each other, to learn if either had sustained any injury by\r\nthe fire; for both well knew that no cry or exclamation would, in such a moment\r\nof necessity have been permitted to betray the accident. A few large drops of\r\nblood were trickling down the shoulder of the Sagamore, who, when he perceived\r\nthat the eyes of Uncas dwelt too long on the sight, raised some water in the\r\nhollow of his hand, and washing off the stain, was content to manifest, in this\r\nsimple manner, the slightness of the injury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, softly, major,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, who by this time had\r\nreloaded his rifle; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are a little too far already for a rifle to put\r\nforth its beauties, and you see yonder imps are holding a council. Let them\r\ncome up within striking distance\xe2\x80\x94my eye may well be trusted in such a\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94and I will trail the varlets the length of the Horican,\r\nguaranteeing that not a shot of theirs shall, at the worst, more than break the\r\nskin, while \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 shall touch the life twice in three\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe forget our errand,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the diligent Duncan. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s sake let us profit by this advantage, and increase our distance\r\nfrom the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me my children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Munro, hoarsely; \xe2\x80\x9ctrifle no\r\nlonger with a father\xe2\x80\x99s agony, but restore me my babes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLong and habitual deference to the mandates of his superiors had taught the\r\nscout the virtue of obedience. Throwing a last and lingering glance at the\r\ndistant canoes, he laid aside his rifle, and, relieving the wearied Duncan,\r\nresumed the paddle, which he wielded with sinews that never tired. His efforts\r\nwere seconded by those of the Mohicans and a very few minutes served to place\r\nsuch a sheet of water between them and their enemies, that Heyward once more\r\nbreathed freely.\r\n\r\nThe lake now began to expand, and their route lay along a wide reach, that was\r\nlined, as before, by high and ragged mountains. But the islands were few, and\r\neasily avoided. The strokes of the paddles grew more measured and regular,\r\nwhile they who plied them continued their labor, after the close and deadly\r\nchase from which they had just relieved themselves, with as much coolness as\r\nthough their speed had been tried in sport, rather than under such pressing,\r\nnay, almost desperate, circumstances.\r\n\r\nInstead of following the western shore, whither their errand led them, the wary\r\nMohican inclined his course more toward those hills behind which Montcalm was\r\nknown to have led his army into the formidable fortress of Ticonderoga. As the\r\nHurons, to every appearance, had abandoned the pursuit, there was no apparent\r\nreason for this excess of caution. It was, however, maintained for hours, until\r\nthey had reached a bay, nigh the northern termination of the lake. Here the\r\ncanoe was driven upon the beach, and the whole party landed. Hawkeye and\r\nHeyward ascended an adjacent bluff, where the former, after considering the\r\nexpanse of water beneath him, pointed out to the latter a small black object,\r\nhovering under a headland, at the distance of several miles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see it?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what would you\r\naccount that spot, were you left alone to white experience to find your way\r\nthrough this wilderness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for its distance and its magnitude, I should suppose it a bird. Can\r\nit be a living object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a canoe of good birchen bark, and paddled by fierce and\r\ncrafty Mingoes. Though Providence has lent to those who inhabit the woods eyes\r\nthat would be needless to men in the settlements, where there are inventions to\r\nassist the sight, yet no human organs can see all the dangers which at this\r\nmoment circumvent us. These varlets pretend to be bent chiefly on their\r\nsun-down meal, but the moment it is dark they will be on our trail, as true as\r\nhounds on the scent. We must throw them off, or our pursuit of Le Renard Subtil\r\nmay be given up. These lakes are useful at times, especially when the game take\r\nthe water,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the scout, gazing about him with a countenance of\r\nconcern; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they give no cover, except it be to the fishes. God knows\r\nwhat the country would be, if the settlements should ever spread far from the\r\ntwo rivers. Both hunting and war would lose their beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us not delay a moment, without some good and obvious cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI little like that smoke, which you may see worming up along the rock\r\nabove the canoe,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the abstracted scout. \xe2\x80\x9cMy life on it,\r\nother eyes than ours see it, and know its meaning. Well, words will not mend\r\nthe matter, and it is time that we were doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye moved away from the lookout, and descended, musing profoundly, to the\r\nshore. He communicated the result of his observations to his companions, in\r\nDelaware, and a short and earnest consultation succeeded. When it terminated,\r\nthe three instantly set about executing their new resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was lifted from the water, and borne on the shoulders of the party,\r\nthey proceeded into the wood, making as broad and obvious a trail as possible.\r\nThey soon reached the water-course, which they crossed, and, continuing onward,\r\nuntil they came to an extensive and naked rock. At this point, where their\r\nfootsteps might be expected to be no longer visible, they retraced their route\r\nto the brook, walking backward, with the utmost care. They now followed the bed\r\nof the little stream to the lake, into which they immediately launched their\r\ncanoe again. A low point concealed them from the headland, and the margin of\r\nthe lake was fringed for some distance with dense and overhanging bushes. Under\r\nthe cover of these natural advantages, they toiled their way, with patient\r\nindustry, until the scout pronounced that he believed it would be safe once\r\nmore to land.\r\n\r\nThe halt continued until evening rendered objects indistinct and uncertain to\r\nthe eye. Then they resumed their route, and, favored by the darkness, pushed\r\nsilently and vigorously toward the western shore. Although the rugged outline\r\nof mountain, to which they were steering, presented no distinctive marks to the\r\neyes of Duncan, the Mohican entered the little haven he had selected with the\r\nconfidence and accuracy of an experienced pilot.\r\n\r\nThe boat was again lifted and borne into the woods, where it was carefully\r\nconcealed under a pile of brush. The adventurers assumed their arms and packs,\r\nand the scout announced to Munro and Heyward that he and the Indians were at\r\nlast in readiness to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you find a man there, he shall die a flea\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Merry Wives of Windsor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party had landed on the border of a region that is, even to this day, less\r\nknown to the inhabitants of the States than the deserts of Arabia, or the\r\nsteppes of Tartary. It was the sterile and rugged district which separates the\r\ntributaries of Champlain from those of the Hudson, the Mohawk, and the St.\r\nLawrence. Since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has\r\nsurrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements, though none but the\r\nhunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses.\r\n\r\nAs Hawkeye and the Mohicans had, however, often traversed the mountains and\r\nvalleys of this vast wilderness, they did not hesitate to plunge into its\r\ndepth, with the freedom of men accustomed to its privations and difficulties.\r\nFor many hours the travelers toiled on their laborious way, guided by a star,\r\nor following the direction of some water-course, until the scout called a halt,\r\nand holding a short consultation with the Indians, they lighted their fire, and\r\nmade the usual preparations to pass the remainder of the night where they then\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nImitating the example, and emulating the confidence of their more experienced\r\nassociates, Munro and Duncan slept without fear, if not without uneasiness. The\r\ndews were suffered to exhale, and the sun had dispersed the mists, and was\r\nshedding a strong and clear light in the forest, when the travelers resumed\r\ntheir journey.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding a few miles, the progress of Hawkeye, who led the advance,\r\nbecame more deliberate and watchful. He often stopped to examine the trees; nor\r\ndid he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity, the\r\nvelocity, and the color of its waters. Distrusting his own judgment, his\r\nappeals to the opinion of Chingachgook were frequent and earnest. During one of\r\nthese conferences Heyward observed that Uncas stood a patient and silent,\r\nthough, as he imagined, an interested listener. He was strongly tempted to\r\naddress the young chief, and demand his opinion of their progress; but the calm\r\nand dignified demeanor of the native induced him to believe, that, like\r\nhimself, the other was wholly dependent on the sagacity and intelligence of the\r\nseniors of the party. At last the scout spoke in English, and at once explained\r\nthe embarrassment of their situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I found that the home path of the Hurons run north,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit did not need the judgment of many long years to tell that they would\r\nfollow the valleys, and keep atween the waters of the Hudson and the Horican,\r\nuntil they might strike the springs of the Canada streams, which would lead\r\nthem into the heart of the country of the Frenchers. Yet here are we, within a\r\nshort range of the Scaroons, and not a sign of a trail have we crossed! Human\r\nnatur\xe2\x80\x99 is weak, and it is possible we may not have taken the proper\r\nscent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven protect us from such an error!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Duncan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us retrace our steps, and examine as we go, with keener eyes. Has\r\nUncas no counsel to offer in such a strait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Mohican cast a glance at his father, but, maintaining his quiet and\r\nreserved mien, he continued silent. Chingachgook had caught the look, and\r\nmotioning with his hand, he bade him speak. The moment this permission was\r\naccorded, the countenance of Uncas changed from its grave composure to a gleam\r\nof intelligence and joy. Bounding forward like a deer, he sprang up the side of\r\na little acclivity, a few rods in advance, and stood, exultingly, over a spot\r\nof fresh earth, that looked as though it had been recently upturned by the\r\npassage of some heavy animal. The eyes of the whole party followed the\r\nunexpected movement, and read their success in the air of triumph that the\r\nyouth assumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the trail!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the scout, advancing to the spot;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe lad is quick of sight and keen of wit for his years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis extraordinary that he should have withheld his knowledge so\r\nlong,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Duncan, at his elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding. No,\r\nno; your young white, who gathers his learning from books and can measure what\r\nhe knows by the page, may conceit that his knowledge, like his legs, outruns\r\nthat of his fathers\xe2\x80\x99, but, where experience is the master, the scholar is\r\nmade to know the value of years, and respects them accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncas, pointing north and south, at the evident marks\r\nof the broad trail on either side of him, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dark-hair has gone toward\r\nthe forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHound never ran on a more beautiful scent,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the scout,\r\ndashing forward, at once, on the indicated route; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are favored,\r\ngreatly favored, and can follow with high noses. Ay, here are both your\r\nwaddling beasts: this Huron travels like a white general. The fellow is\r\nstricken with a judgment, and is mad! Look sharp for wheels, Sagamore,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe continued, looking back, and laughing in his newly awakened satisfaction;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe shall soon have the fool journeying in a coach, and that with three\r\nof the best pair of eyes on the borders in his rear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the scout, and the astonishing success of the chase, in which a\r\ncircuitous distance of more than forty miles had been passed, did not fail to\r\nimpart a portion of hope to the whole party. Their advance was rapid; and made\r\nwith as much confidence as a traveler would proceed along a wide highway. If a\r\nrock, or a rivulet, or a bit of earth harder than common, severed the links of\r\nthe clew they followed, the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance,\r\nand seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary. Their progress was\r\nmuch facilitated by the certainty that Magua had found it necessary to journey\r\nthrough the valleys; a circumstance which rendered the general direction of the\r\nroute sure. Nor had the Huron entirely neglected the arts uniformly practised\r\nby the natives when retiring in front of an enemy. False trails and sudden\r\nturnings were frequent, wherever a brook or the formation of the ground\r\nrendered them feasible; but his pursuers were rarely deceived, and never failed\r\nto detect their error, before they had lost either time or distance on the\r\ndeceptive track.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the afternoon they had passed the Scaroons, and were following\r\nthe route of the declining sun. After descending an eminence to a low bottom,\r\nthrough which a swift stream glided, they suddenly came to a place where the\r\nparty of Le Renard had made a halt. Extinguished brands were lying around a\r\nspring, the offals of a deer were scattered about the place, and the trees bore\r\nevident marks of having been browsed by the horses. At a little distance,\r\nHeyward discovered, and contemplated with tender emotion, the small bower under\r\nwhich he was fain to believe that Cora and Alice had reposed. But while the\r\nearth was trodden, and the footsteps of both men and beasts were so plainly\r\nvisible around the place, the trail appeared to have suddenly ended.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to follow the tracks of the Narragansetts, but they seemed only to\r\nhave wandered without guides, or any other object than the pursuit of food. At\r\nlength Uncas, who, with his father, had endeavored to trace the route of the\r\nhorses, came upon a sign of their presence that was quite recent. Before\r\nfollowing the clew, he communicated his success to his companions; and while\r\nthe latter were consulting on the circumstance, the youth reappeared, leading\r\nthe two fillies, with their saddles broken, and the housings soiled, as though\r\nthey had been permitted to run at will for several days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should this prove?\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, turning pale, and glancing\r\nhis eyes around him, as if he feared the brush and leaves were about to give up\r\nsome horrid secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat our march is come to a quick end, and that we are in an\r\nenemy\xe2\x80\x99s country,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cHad the knave been\r\npressed, and the gentle ones wanted horses to keep up with the party, he might\r\nhave taken their scalps; but without an enemy at his heels, and with such\r\nrugged beasts as these, he would not hurt a hair of their heads. I know your\r\nthoughts, and shame be it to our color that you have reason for them; but he\r\nwho thinks that even a Mingo would ill-treat a woman, unless it be to tomahawk\r\nher, knows nothing of Indian natur\xe2\x80\x99, or the laws of the woods. No, no; I\r\nhave heard that the French Indians had come into these hills to hunt the moose,\r\nand we are getting within scent of their camp. Why should they not? The morning\r\nand evening guns of Ty may be heard any day among these mountains; for the\r\nFrenchers are running a new line atween the provinces of the king and the\r\nCanadas. It is true that the horses are here, but the Hurons are gone; let us,\r\nthen, hunt for the path by which they parted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye and the Mohicans now applied themselves to their task in good earnest.\r\nA circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn, and each of the\r\nparty took a segment for his portion. The examination, however, resulted in no\r\ndiscovery. The impressions of footsteps were numerous, but they all appeared\r\nlike those of men who had wandered about the spot, without any design to quit\r\nit. Again the scout and his companions made the circuit of the halting place,\r\neach slowly following the other, until they assembled in the center once more,\r\nno wiser than when they started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch cunning is not without its deviltry,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hawkeye, when\r\nhe met the disappointed looks of his assistants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must get down to it, Sagamore, beginning at the spring, and going\r\nover the ground by inches. The Huron shall never brag in his tribe that he has\r\na foot which leaves no print.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSetting the example himself, the scout engaged in the scrutiny with renewed\r\nzeal. Not a leaf was left unturned. The sticks were removed, and the stones\r\nlifted; for Indian cunning was known frequently to adopt these objects as\r\ncovers, laboring with the utmost patience and industry, to conceal each\r\nfootstep as they proceeded. Still no discovery was made. At length Uncas, whose\r\nactivity had enabled him to achieve his portion of the task the soonest, raked\r\nthe earth across the turbid little rill which ran from the spring, and diverted\r\nits course into another channel. So soon as its narrow bed below the dam was\r\ndry, he stooped over it with keen and curious eyes. A cry of exultation\r\nimmediately announced the success of the young warrior. The whole party crowded\r\nto the spot where Uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist\r\nalluvion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis lad will be an honor to his people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, regarding\r\nthe trail with as much admiration as a naturalist would expend on the tusk of a\r\nmammoth or the rib of a mastodon; \xe2\x80\x9cay, and a thorn in the sides of the\r\nHurons. Yet that is not the footstep of an Indian! the weight is too much on\r\nthe heel, and the toes are squared, as though one of the French dancers had\r\nbeen in, pigeon-winging his tribe! Run back, Uncas, and bring me the size of\r\nthe singer\xe2\x80\x99s foot. You will find a beautiful print of it just opposite\r\nyon rock, agin the hillside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the youth was engaged in this commission, the scout and Chingachgook were\r\nattentively considering the impressions. The measurements agreed, and the\r\nformer unhesitatingly pronounced that the footstep was that of David, who had\r\nonce more been made to exchange his shoes for moccasins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can now read the whole of it, as plainly as if I had seen the arts of\r\nLe Subtil,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cthe singer being a man whose gifts lay\r\nchiefly in his throat and feet, was made to go first, and the others have trod\r\nin his steps, imitating their formation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Duncan, \xe2\x80\x9cI see no signs of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentle ones,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cthe varlet has\r\nfound a way to carry them, until he supposed he had thrown any followers off\r\nthe scent. My life on it, we see their pretty little feet again, before many\r\nrods go by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole party now proceeded, following the course of the rill, keeping\r\nanxious eyes on the regular impressions. The water soon flowed into its bed\r\nagain, but watching the ground on either side, the foresters pursued their way\r\ncontent with knowing that the trail lay beneath. More than half a mile was\r\npassed, before the rill rippled close around the base of an extensive and dry\r\nrock. Here they paused to make sure that the Hurons had not quitted the water.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate they did so. For the quick and active Uncas soon found the\r\nimpression of a foot on a bunch of moss, where it would seem an Indian had\r\ninadvertently trodden. Pursuing the direction given by this discovery, he\r\nentered the neighboring thicket, and struck the trail, as fresh and obvious as\r\nit had been before they reached the spring. Another shout announced the good\r\nfortune of the youth to his companions, and at once terminated the search.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, it has been planned with Indian judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout,\r\nwhen the party was assembled around the place, \xe2\x80\x9cand would have blinded\r\nwhite eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we proceed?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, softly, we know our path; but it is good to examine the\r\nformation of things. This is my schooling, major; and if one neglects the book,\r\nthere is little chance of learning from the open land of Providence. All is\r\nplain but one thing, which is the manner that the knave contrived to get the\r\ngentle ones along the blind trail. Even a Huron would be too proud to let their\r\ntender feet touch the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill this assist in explaining the difficulty?\xe2\x80\x9d said Heyward,\r\npointing toward the fragments of a sort of handbarrow, that had been rudely\r\nconstructed of boughs, and bound together with withes, and which now seemed\r\ncarelessly cast aside as useless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis explained!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the delighted Hawkeye. \xe2\x80\x9cIf them\r\nvarlets have passed a minute, they have spent hours in striving to fabricate a\r\nlying end to their trail! Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve known them to waste a day in the\r\nsame manner to as little purpose. Here we have three pair of moccasins, and two\r\nof little feet. It is amazing that any mortal beings can journey on limbs so\r\nsmall! Pass me the thong of buckskin, Uncas, and let me take the length of this\r\nfoot. By the Lord, it is no longer than a child\xe2\x80\x99s and yet the maidens are\r\ntall and comely. That Providence is partial in its gifts, for its own wise\r\nreasons, the best and most contented of us must allow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tender limbs of my daughters are unequal to these hardships,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Munro, looking at the light footsteps of his children, with a\r\nparent\xe2\x80\x99s love; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall find their fainting forms in this\r\ndesert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf that there is little cause of fear,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, slowly\r\nshaking his head; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a firm and straight, though a light step, and\r\nnot over long. See, the heel has hardly touched the ground; and there the\r\ndark-hair has made a little jump, from root to root. No, no; my knowledge for\r\nit, neither of them was nigh fainting, hereaway. Now, the singer was beginning\r\nto be footsore and leg-weary, as is plain by his trail. There, you see, he\r\nslipped; here he has traveled wide and tottered; and there again it looks as\r\nthough he journeyed on snowshoes. Ay, ay, a man who uses his throat altogether,\r\ncan hardly give his legs a proper training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom such undeniable testimony did the practised woodsman arrive at the truth,\r\nwith nearly as much certainty and precision as if he had been a witness of all\r\nthose events which his ingenuity so easily elucidated. Cheered by these\r\nassurances, and satisfied by a reasoning that was so obvious, while it was so\r\nsimple, the party resumed its course, after making a short halt, to take a\r\nhurried repast.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was ended, the scout cast a glance upward at the setting sun, and\r\npushed forward with a rapidity which compelled Heyward and the still vigorous\r\nMunro to exert all their muscles to equal. Their route now lay along the bottom\r\nwhich has already been mentioned. As the Hurons had made no further efforts to\r\nconceal their footsteps, the progress of the pursuers was no longer delayed by\r\nuncertainty. Before an hour had elapsed, however, the speed of Hawkeye sensibly\r\nabated, and his head, instead of maintaining its former direct and forward\r\nlook, began to turn suspiciously from side to side, as if he were conscious of\r\napproaching danger. He soon stopped again, and waited for the whole party to\r\ncome up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scent the Hurons,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking to the Mohicans;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyonder is open sky, through the treetops, and we are getting too nigh\r\ntheir encampment. Sagamore, you will take the hillside, to the right; Uncas\r\nwill bend along the brook to the left, while I will try the trail. If anything\r\nshould happen, the call will be three croaks of a crow. I saw one of the birds\r\nfanning himself in the air, just beyond the dead oak\xe2\x80\x94another sign that we\r\nare approaching an encampment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indians departed their several ways without reply, while Hawkeye cautiously\r\nproceeded with the two gentlemen. Heyward soon pressed to the side of their\r\nguide, eager to catch an early glimpse of those enemies he had pursued with so\r\nmuch toil and anxiety. His companion told him to steal to the edge of the wood,\r\nwhich, as usual, was fringed with a thicket, and wait his coming, for he wished\r\nto examine certain suspicious signs a little on one side. Duncan obeyed, and\r\nsoon found himself in a situation to command a view which he found as\r\nextraordinary as it was novel.\r\n\r\nThe trees of many acres had been felled, and the glow of a mild summer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevening had fallen on the clearing, in beautiful contrast to the gray light of\r\nthe forest. A short distance from the place where Duncan stood, the stream had\r\nseemingly expanded into a little lake, covering most of the low land, from\r\nmountain to mountain. The water fell out of this wide basin, in a cataract so\r\nregular and gentle, that it appeared rather to be the work of human hands than\r\nfashioned by nature. A hundred earthen dwellings stood on the margin of the\r\nlake, and even in its waters, as though the latter had overflowed its usual\r\nbanks. Their rounded roofs, admirably molded for defense against the weather,\r\ndenoted more of industry and foresight than the natives were wont to bestow on\r\ntheir regular habitations, much less on those they occupied for the temporary\r\npurposes of hunting and war. In short, the whole village or town, whichever it\r\nmight be termed, possessed more of method and neatness of execution, than the\r\nwhite men had been accustomed to believe belonged, ordinarily, to the Indian\r\nhabits. It appeared, however, to be deserted. At least, so thought Duncan for\r\nmany minutes; but, at length, he fancied he discovered several human forms\r\nadvancing toward him on all fours, and apparently dragging in the train some\r\nheavy, and as he was quick to apprehend, some formidable engine. Just then a\r\nfew dark-looking heads gleamed out of the dwellings, and the place seemed\r\nsuddenly alive with beings, which, however, glided from cover to cover so\r\nswiftly, as to allow no opportunity of examining their humors or pursuits.\r\nAlarmed at these suspicious and inexplicable movements, he was about to attempt\r\nthe signal of the crows, when the rustling of leaves at hand drew his eyes in\r\nanother direction.\r\n\r\nThe young man started, and recoiled a few paces instinctively, when he found\r\nhimself within a hundred yards of a stranger Indian. Recovering his\r\nrecollection on the instant, instead of sounding an alarm, which might prove\r\nfatal to himself, he remained stationary, an attentive observer of the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s motions.\r\n\r\nAn instant of calm observation served to assure Duncan that he was\r\nundiscovered. The native, like himself, seemed occupied in considering the low\r\ndwellings of the village, and the stolen movements of its inhabitants. It was\r\nimpossible to discover the expression of his features through the grotesque\r\nmask of paint under which they were concealed, though Duncan fancied it was\r\nrather melancholy than savage. His head was shaved, as usual, with the\r\nexception of the crown, from whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a\r\nhawk\xe2\x80\x99s wing were loosely dangling. A ragged calico mantle half encircled\r\nhis body, while his nether garment was composed of an ordinary shirt, the\r\nsleeves of which were made to perform the office that is usually executed by a\r\nmuch more commodious arrangement. His legs were, however, covered with a pair\r\nof good deer-skin moccasins. Altogether, the appearance of the individual was\r\nforlorn and miserable.\r\n\r\nDuncan was still curiously observing the person of his neighbor when the scout\r\nstole silently and cautiously to his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see we have reached their settlement or encampment,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\r\nthe young man; \xe2\x80\x9cand here is one of the savages himself, in a very\r\nembarrassing position for our further movements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye started, and dropped his rifle, when, directed by the finger of his\r\ncompanion, the stranger came under his view. Then lowering the dangerous muzzle\r\nhe stretched forward his long neck, as if to assist a scrutiny that was already\r\nintensely keen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe imp is not a Huron,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnor of any of the Canada\r\ntribes; and yet you see, by his clothes, the knave has been plundering a white.\r\nAy, Montcalm has raked the woods for his inroad, and a whooping, murdering set\r\nof varlets has he gathered together. Can you see where he has put his rifle or\r\nhis bow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe appears to have no arms; nor does he seem to be viciously inclined.\r\nUnless he communicate the alarm to his fellows, who, as you see, are dodging\r\nabout the water, we have but little to fear from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout turned to Heyward, and regarded him a moment with unconcealed\r\namazement. Then opening wide his mouth, he indulged in unrestrained and\r\nheartfelt laughter, though in that silent and peculiar manner which danger had\r\nso long taught him to practise.\r\n\r\nRepeating the words, \xe2\x80\x9cFellows who are dodging about the water!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cso much for schooling and passing a boyhood in the settlements!\r\nThe knave has long legs, though, and shall not be trusted. Do you keep him\r\nunder your rifle while I creep in behind, through the bush, and take him alive.\r\nFire on no account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward had already permitted his companion to bury part of his person in the\r\nthicket, when, stretching forth his arm, he arrested him, in order to ask:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I see you in danger, may I not risk a shot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye regarded him a moment, like one who knew not how to take the question;\r\nthen, nodding his head, he answered, still laughing, though inaudibly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire a whole platoon, major.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the next moment he was concealed by the leaves. Duncan waited several\r\nminutes in feverish impatience, before he caught another glimpse of the scout.\r\nThen he reappeared, creeping along the earth, from which his dress was hardly\r\ndistinguishable, directly in the rear of his intended captive. Having reached\r\nwithin a few yards of the latter, he arose to his feet, silently and slowly. At\r\nthat instant, several loud blows were struck on the water, and Duncan turned\r\nhis eyes just in time to perceive that a hundred dark forms were plunging, in a\r\nbody, into the troubled little sheet. Grasping his rifle his looks were again\r\nbent on the Indian near him. Instead of taking the alarm, the unconscious\r\nsavage stretched forward his neck, as if he also watched the movements about\r\nthe gloomy lake, with a sort of silly curiosity. In the meantime, the uplifted\r\nhand of Hawkeye was above him. But, without any apparent reason, it was\r\nwithdrawn, and its owner indulged in another long, though still silent, fit of\r\nmerriment. When the peculiar and hearty laughter of Hawkeye was ended, instead\r\nof grasping his victim by the throat, he tapped him lightly on the shoulder,\r\nand exclaimed aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now, friend! have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d was the ready answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would seem that the\r\nBeing that gave them power to improve His gifts so well, would not deny them\r\nvoices to proclaim His praise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBot.\xe2\x80\x94Abibl we all met?\r\nQui.\xe2\x80\x94Pat\xe2\x80\x94pat; and here\xe2\x80\x99s a marvelous convenient place for our\r\nrehearsal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may better imagine, than we describe the surprise of Heyward. His\r\nlurking Indians were suddenly converted into four-footed beasts; his lake into\r\na beaver pond; his cataract into a dam, constructed by those industrious and\r\ningenious quadrupeds; and a suspected enemy into his tried friend, David Gamut,\r\nthe master of psalmody. The presence of the latter created so many unexpected\r\nhopes relative to the sisters that, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, the\r\nyoung man broke out of his ambush, and sprang forward to join the two principal\r\nactors in the scene.\r\n\r\nThe merriment of Hawkeye was not easily appeased. Without ceremony, and with a\r\nrough hand, he twirled the supple Gamut around on his heel, and more than once\r\naffirmed that the Hurons had done themselves great credit in the fashion of his\r\ncostume. Then, seizing the hand of the other, he squeezed it with a grip that\r\nbrought tears into the eyes of the placid David, and wished him joy of his new\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were about opening your throat-practisings among the beavers, were\r\nye?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cunning devils know half the trade already, for\r\nthey beat the time with their tails, as you heard just now; and in good time it\r\nwas, too, or \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 might have sounded the first note among\r\nthem. I have known greater fools, who could read and write, than an experienced\r\nold beaver; but as for squalling, the animals are born dumb! What think you of\r\nsuch a song as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid shut his sensitive ears, and even Heyward apprised as he was of the\r\nnature of the cry, looked upward in quest of the bird, as the cawing of a crow\r\nrang in the air about them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the laughing scout, as he pointed toward the\r\nremainder of the party, who, in obedience to the signal, were already\r\napproaching; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is music which has its natural virtues; it brings two\r\ngood rifles to my elbow, to say nothing of the knives and tomahawks. But we see\r\nthat you are safe; now tell us what has become of the maidens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are captives to the heathen,\xe2\x80\x9d said David; \xe2\x80\x9cand, though\r\ngreatly troubled in spirit, enjoying comfort and safety in the body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth!\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the breathless Heyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so. Though our wayfaring has been sore and our sustenance scanty,\r\nwe have had little other cause for complaint, except the violence done our\r\nfeelings, by being thus led in captivity into a far land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless ye for these very words!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the trembling Munro;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall then receive my babes, spotless and angel-like, as I lost\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not that their delivery is at hand,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the doubting\r\nDavid; \xe2\x80\x9cthe leader of these savages is possessed of an evil spirit that\r\nno power short of Omnipotence can tame. I have tried him sleeping and waking,\r\nbut neither sounds nor language seem to touch his soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the knave?\xe2\x80\x9d bluntly interrupted the scout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hunts the moose to-day, with his young men; and tomorrow, as I hear,\r\nthey pass further into the forests, and nigher to the borders of Canada. The\r\nelder maiden is conveyed to a neighboring people, whose lodges are situate\r\nbeyond yonder black pinnacle of rock; while the younger is detained among the\r\nwomen of the Hurons, whose dwellings are but two short miles hence, on a\r\ntable-land, where the fire had done the office of the axe, and prepared the\r\nplace for their reception.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice, my gentle Alice!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has lost the\r\nconsolation of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s presence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so. But so far as praise and thanksgiving in psalmody can temper\r\nthe spirit in affliction, she has not suffered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she then a heart for music?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the graver and more solemn character; though it must be acknowledged\r\nthat, in spite of all my endeavors, the maiden weeps oftener than she smiles.\r\nAt such moments I forbear to press the holy songs; but there are many sweet and\r\ncomfortable periods of satisfactory communication, when the ears of the savages\r\nare astounded with the upliftings of our voices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why are you permitted to go at large, unwatched?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid composed his features into what he intended should express an air of\r\nmodest humility, before he meekly replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle be the praise to such a worm as I. But, though the power of\r\npsalmody was suspended in the terrible business of that field of blood through\r\nwhich we have passed, it has recovered its influence even over the souls of the\r\nheathen, and I am suffered to go and come at will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout laughed, and, tapping his own forehead significantly, he perhaps\r\nexplained the singular indulgence more satisfactorily when he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians never harm a non-composser. But why, when the path lay open\r\nbefore your eyes, did you not strike back on your own trail (it is not so blind\r\nas that which a squirrel would make), and bring in the tidings to\r\nEdward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout, remembering only his own sturdy and iron nature, had probably\r\nexacted a task that David, under no circumstances, could have performed. But,\r\nwithout entirely losing the meekness of his air, the latter was content to\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough my soul would rejoice to visit the habitations of Christendom\r\nonce more, my feet would rather follow the tender spirits intrusted to my\r\nkeeping, even into the idolatrous province of the Jesuits, than take one step\r\nbackward, while they pined in captivity and sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough the figurative language of David was not very intelligible, the sincere\r\nand steady expression of his eye, and the glow of his honest countenance, were\r\nnot easily mistaken. Uncas pressed closer to his side, and regarded the speaker\r\nwith a look of commendation, while his father expressed his satisfaction by the\r\nordinary pithy exclamation of approbation. The scout shook his head as he\r\nrejoined:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord never intended that the man should place all his endeavors in\r\nhis throat, to the neglect of other and better gifts! But he has fallen into\r\nthe hands of some silly woman, when he should have been gathering his education\r\nunder a blue sky, among the beauties of the forest. Here, friend; I did intend\r\nto kindle a fire with this tooting-whistle of thine; but, as you value the\r\nthing, take it, and blow your best on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGamut received his pitch-pipe with as strong an expression of pleasure as he\r\nbelieved compatible with the grave functions he exercised. After essaying its\r\nvirtues repeatedly, in contrast with his own voice, and, satisfying himself\r\nthat none of its melody was lost, he made a very serious demonstration toward\r\nachieving a few stanzas of one of the longest effusions in the little volume so\r\noften mentioned.\r\n\r\nHeyward, however, hastily interrupted his pious purpose by continuing questions\r\nconcerning the past and present condition of his fellow captives, and in a\r\nmanner more methodical than had been permitted by his feelings in the opening\r\nof their interview. David, though he regarded his treasure with longing eyes,\r\nwas constrained to answer, especially as the venerable father took a part in\r\nthe interrogatories, with an interest too imposing to be denied. Nor did the\r\nscout fail to throw in a pertinent inquiry, whenever a fitting occasion\r\npresented. In this manner, though with frequent interruptions which were filled\r\nwith certain threatening sounds from the recovered instrument, the pursuers\r\nwere put in possession of such leading circumstances as were likely to prove\r\nuseful in accomplishing their great and engrossing object\xe2\x80\x94the recovery of\r\nthe sisters. The narrative of David was simple, and the facts but few.\r\n\r\nMagua had waited on the mountain until a safe moment to retire presented\r\nitself, when he had descended, and taken the route along the western side of\r\nthe Horican in direction of the Canadas. As the subtle Huron was familiar with\r\nthe paths, and well knew there was no immediate danger of pursuit, their\r\nprogress had been moderate, and far from fatiguing. It appeared from the\r\nunembellished statement of David, that his own presence had been rather endured\r\nthan desired; though even Magua had not been entirely exempt from that\r\nveneration with which the Indians regard those whom the Great Spirit had\r\nvisited in their intellects. At night, the utmost care had been taken of the\r\ncaptives, both to prevent injury from the damps of the woods and to guard\r\nagainst an escape. At the spring, the horses were turned loose, as has been\r\nseen; and, notwithstanding the remoteness and length of their trail, the\r\nartifices already named were resorted to, in order to cut off every clue to\r\ntheir place of retreat. On their arrival at the encampment of his people,\r\nMagua, in obedience to a policy seldom departed from, separated his prisoners.\r\nCora had been sent to a tribe that temporarily occupied an adjacent valley,\r\nthough David was far too ignorant of the customs and history of the natives, to\r\nbe able to declare anything satisfactory concerning their name or character. He\r\nonly knew that they had not engaged in the late expedition against William\r\nHenry; that, like the Hurons themselves they were allies of Montcalm; and that\r\nthey maintained an amicable, though a watchful intercourse with the warlike and\r\nsavage people whom chance had, for a time, brought in such close and\r\ndisagreeable contact with themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Mohicans and the scout listened to his interrupted and imperfect narrative,\r\nwith an interest that obviously increased as he proceeded; and it was while\r\nattempting to explain the pursuits of the community in which Cora was detained,\r\nthat the latter abruptly demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see the fashion of their knives? were they of English or French\r\nformation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy thoughts were bent on no such vanities, but rather mingled in\r\nconsolation with those of the maidens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time may come when you will not consider the knife of a savage such\r\na despicable vanity,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, with a strong expression of\r\ncontempt for the other\xe2\x80\x99s dullness. \xe2\x80\x9cHad they held their corn\r\nfeast\xe2\x80\x94or can you say anything of the totems of the tribe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf corn, we had many and plentiful feasts; for the grain, being in the\r\nmilk is both sweet to the mouth and comfortable to the stomach. Of totem, I\r\nknow not the meaning; but if it appertaineth in any wise to the art of Indian\r\nmusic, it need not be inquired after at their hands. They never join their\r\nvoices in praise, and it would seem that they are among the profanest of the\r\nidolatrous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherein you belie the natur\xe2\x80\x99 of an Indian. Even the Mingo adores\r\nbut the true and loving God. \xe2\x80\x99Tis wicked fabrication of the whites, and I\r\nsay it to the shame of my color that would make the warrior bow down before\r\nimages of his own creation. It is true, they endeavor to make truces to the\r\nwicked one\xe2\x80\x94as who would not with an enemy he cannot conquer! but they\r\nlook up for favor and assistance to the Great and Good Spirit only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said David; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have seen strange and\r\nfantastic images drawn in their paint, of which their admiration and care\r\nsavored of spiritual pride; especially one, and that, too, a foul and loathsome\r\nobject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it a sarpent?\xe2\x80\x9d quickly demanded the scout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch the same. It was in the likeness of an abject and creeping\r\ntortoise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed both the attentive Mohicans in a breath; while\r\nthe scout shook his head with the air of one who had made an important but by\r\nno means a pleasing discovery. Then the father spoke, in the language of the\r\nDelawares, and with a calmness and dignity that instantly arrested the\r\nattention even of those to whom his words were unintelligible. His gestures\r\nwere impressive, and at times energetic. Once he lifted his arm on high; and,\r\nas it descended, the action threw aside the folds of his light mantle, a finger\r\nresting on his breast, as if he would enforce his meaning by the attitude.\r\nDuncan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed the movement, and he perceived that the animal\r\njust mentioned was beautifully, though faintly, worked in blue tint, on the\r\nswarthy breast of the chief. All that he had ever heard of the violent\r\nseparation of the vast tribes of the Delawares rushed across his mind, and he\r\nawaited the proper moment to speak, with a suspense that was rendered nearly\r\nintolerable by his interest in the stake. His wish, however, was anticipated by\r\nthe scout who turned from his red friend, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have found that which may be good or evil to us, as heaven disposes.\r\nThe Sagamore is of the high blood of the Delawares, and is the great chief of\r\ntheir Tortoises! That some of this stock are among the people of whom the\r\nsinger tells us, is plain by his words; and, had he but spent half the breath\r\nin prudent questions that he has blown away in making a trumpet of his throat,\r\nwe might have known how many warriors they numbered. It is, altogether, a\r\ndangerous path we move in; for a friend whose face is turned from you often\r\nbears a bloodier mind than the enemy who seeks your scalp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a long and melancholy tradition, and one I little like to\r\nthink of; for it is not to be denied that the evil has been mainly done by men\r\nwith white skins. But it has ended in turning the tomahawk of brother against\r\nbrother, and brought the Mingo and the Delaware to travel in the same\r\npath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, then, suspect it is a portion of that people among whom Cora\r\nresides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout nodded his head in assent, though he seemed anxious to waive the\r\nfurther discussion of a subject that appeared painful. The impatient Duncan now\r\nmade several hasty and desperate propositions to attempt the release of the\r\nsisters. Munro seemed to shake off his apathy, and listened to the wild schemes\r\nof the young man with a deference that his gray hairs and reverend years should\r\nhave denied. But the scout, after suffering the ardor of the lover to expend\r\nitself a little, found means to convince him of the folly of precipitation, in\r\na manner that would require their coolest judgment and utmost fortitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be well,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cto let this man go in again,\r\nas usual, and for him to tarry in the lodges, giving notice to the gentle ones\r\nof our approach, until we call him out, by signal, to consult. You know the cry\r\nof a crow, friend, from the whistle of the whip-poor-will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a pleasing bird,\xe2\x80\x9d returned David, \xe2\x80\x9cand has a soft\r\nand melancholy note! though the time is rather quick and ill-measured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe speaks of the wish-ton-wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cwell,\r\nsince you like his whistle, it shall be your signal. Remember, then, when you\r\nhear the whip-poor-will\xe2\x80\x99s call three times repeated, you are to come into\r\nthe bushes where the bird might be supposed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cI will accompany him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the astonished Hawkeye; \xe2\x80\x9care you tired of\r\nseeing the sun rise and set?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavid is a living proof that the Hurons can be merciful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but David can use his throat, as no man in his senses would pervart\r\nthe gift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI too can play the madman, the fool, the hero; in short, any or\r\neverything to rescue her I love. Name your objections no longer: I am\r\nresolved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye regarded the young man a moment in speechless amazement. But Duncan,\r\nwho, in deference to the other\xe2\x80\x99s skill and services, had hitherto\r\nsubmitted somewhat implicitly to his dictation, now assumed the superior, with\r\na manner that was not easily resisted. He waved his hand, in sign of his\r\ndislike to all remonstrance, and then, in more tempered language, he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the means of disguise; change me; paint me, too, if you will;\r\nin short, alter me to anything\xe2\x80\x94a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for one like me to say that he who is already formed by so\r\npowerful a hand as Providence, stands in need of a change,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the\r\ndiscontented scout. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you send your parties abroad in war, you find\r\nit prudent, at least, to arrange the marks and places of encampment, in order\r\nthat they who fight on your side may know when and where to expect a\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have heard from this\r\nfaithful follower of the captives, that the Indians are of two tribes, if not\r\nof different nations. With one, whom you think to be a branch of the Delawares,\r\nis she you call the \xe2\x80\x98dark-hair\xe2\x80\x99; the other, and younger, of the\r\nladies, is undeniably with our declared enemies, the Hurons. It becomes my\r\nyouth and rank to attempt the latter adventure. While you, therefore, are\r\nnegotiating with your friends for the release of one of the sisters, I will\r\neffect that of the other, or die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe awakened spirit of the young soldier gleamed in his eyes, and his form\r\nbecame imposing under its influence. Hawkeye, though too much accustomed to\r\nIndian artifices not to foresee the danger of the experiment, knew not well how\r\nto combat this sudden resolution.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was something in the proposal that suited his own hardy nature,\r\nand that secret love of desperate adventure, which had increased with his\r\nexperience, until hazard and danger had become, in some measure, necessary to\r\nthe enjoyment of his existence. Instead of continuing to oppose the scheme of\r\nDuncan, his humor suddenly altered, and he lent himself to its execution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a good-humored smile; \xe2\x80\x9cthe buck that\r\nwill take to the water must be headed, and not followed. Chingachgook has as\r\nmany different paints as the engineer officer\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who takes down\r\nnatur\xe2\x80\x99 on scraps of paper, making the mountains look like cocks of rusty\r\nhay, and placing the blue sky in reach of your hand. The Sagamore can use them,\r\ntoo. Seat yourself on the log; and my life on it, he can soon make a natural\r\nfool of you, and that well to your liking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan complied; and the Mohican, who had been an attentive listener to the\r\ndiscourse, readily undertook the office. Long practised in all the subtle arts\r\nof his race, he drew, with great dexterity and quickness, the fantastic shadow\r\nthat the natives were accustomed to consider as the evidence of a friendly and\r\njocular disposition. Every line that could possibly be interpreted into a\r\nsecret inclination for war, was carefully avoided; while, on the other hand, he\r\nstudied those conceits that might be construed into amity.\r\n\r\nIn short, he entirely sacrificed every appearance of the warrior to the\r\nmasquerade of a buffoon. Such exhibitions were not uncommon among the Indians,\r\nand as Duncan was already sufficiently disguised in his dress, there certainly\r\ndid exist some reason for believing that, with his knowledge of French, he\r\nmight pass for a juggler from Ticonderoga, straggling among the allied and\r\nfriendly tribes.\r\n\r\nWhen he was thought to be sufficiently painted, the scout gave him much\r\nfriendly advice; concerted signals, and appointed the place where they should\r\nmeet, in the event of mutual success. The parting between Munro and his young\r\nfriend was more melancholy; still, the former submitted to the separation with\r\nan indifference that his warm and honest nature would never have permitted in a\r\nmore healthful state of mind. The scout led Heyward aside, and acquainted him\r\nwith his intention to leave the veteran in some safe encampment, in charge of\r\nChingachgook, while he and Uncas pursued their inquires among the people they\r\nhad reason to believe were Delawares. Then, renewing his cautions and advice,\r\nhe concluded by saying, with a solemnity and warmth of feeling, with which\r\nDuncan was deeply touched:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, now, God bless you! You have shown a spirit that I like; for it is\r\nthe gift of youth, more especially one of warm blood and a stout heart. But\r\nbelieve the warning of a man who has reason to know all he says to be true. You\r\nwill have occasion for your best manhood, and for a sharper wit than what is to\r\nbe gathered in books, afore you outdo the cunning or get the better of the\r\ncourage of a Mingo. God bless you! if the Hurons master your scalp, rely on the\r\npromise of one who has two stout warriors to back him. They shall pay for their\r\nvictory, with a life for every hair it holds. I say, young gentleman, may\r\nProvidence bless your undertaking, which is altogether for good; and, remember,\r\nthat to outwit the knaves it is lawful to practise things that may not be\r\nnaturally the gift of a white-skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan shook his worthy and reluctant associate warmly by the hand, once more\r\nrecommended his aged friend to his care, and returning his good wishes, he\r\nmotioned to David to proceed. Hawkeye gazed after the high-spirited and\r\nadventurous young man for several moments, in open admiration; then, shaking\r\nhis head doubtingly, he turned, and led his own division of the party into the\r\nconcealment of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe route taken by Duncan and David lay directly across the clearing of the\r\nbeavers, and along the margin of their pond.\r\n\r\nWhen the former found himself alone with one so simple, and so little qualified\r\nto render any assistance in desperate emergencies, he first began to be\r\nsensible of the difficulties of the task he had undertaken. The fading light\r\nincreased the gloominess of the bleak and savage wilderness that stretched so\r\nfar on every side of him, and there was even a fearful character in the\r\nstillness of those little huts, that he knew were so abundantly peopled. It\r\nstruck him, as he gazed at the admirable structures and the wonderful\r\nprecautions of their sagacious inmates, that even the brutes of these vast\r\nwilds were possessed of an instinct nearly commensurate with his own reason;\r\nand he could not reflect, without anxiety, on the unequal contest that he had\r\nso rashly courted. Then came the glowing image of Alice; her distress; her\r\nactual danger; and all the peril of his situation was forgotten. Cheering\r\nDavid, he moved on with the light and vigorous step of youth and enterprise.\r\n\r\nAfter making nearly a semicircle around the pond, they diverged from the\r\nwater-course, and began to ascend to the level of a slight elevation in that\r\nbottom land, over which they journeyed. Within half an hour they gained the\r\nmargin of another opening that bore all the signs of having been also made by\r\nthe beavers, and which those sagacious animals had probably been induced, by\r\nsome accident, to abandon, for the more eligible position they now occupied. A\r\nvery natural sensation caused Duncan to hesitate a moment, unwilling to leave\r\nthe cover of their bushy path, as a man pauses to collect his energies before\r\nhe essays any hazardous experiment, in which he is secretly conscious they will\r\nall be needed. He profited by the halt, to gather such information as might be\r\nobtained from his short and hasty glances.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the clearing, and near the point where the brook\r\ntumbled over some rocks, from a still higher level, some fifty or sixty lodges,\r\nrudely fabricated of logs brush, and earth intermingled, were to be discovered.\r\nThey were arranged without any order, and seemed to be constructed with very\r\nlittle attention to neatness or beauty. Indeed, so very inferior were they in\r\nthe two latter particulars to the village Duncan had just seen, that he began\r\nto expect a second surprise, no less astonishing that the former. This\r\nexpectation was in no degree diminished, when, by the doubtful twilight, he\r\nbeheld twenty or thirty forms rising alternately from the cover of the tall,\r\ncoarse grass, in front of the lodges, and then sinking again from the sight, as\r\nit were to burrow in the earth. By the sudden and hasty glimpses that he caught\r\nof these figures, they seemed more like dark, glancing specters, or some other\r\nunearthly beings, than creatures fashioned with the ordinary and vulgar\r\nmaterials of flesh and blood. A gaunt, naked form was seen, for a single\r\ninstant, tossing its arms wildly in the air, and then the spot it had filled\r\nwas vacant; the figure appearing suddenly in some other and distant place, or\r\nbeing succeeded by another, possessing the same mysterious character. David,\r\nobserving that his companion lingered, pursued the direction of his gaze, and\r\nin some measure recalled the recollection of Heyward, by speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is much fruitful soil uncultivated here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand, I may add, without the sinful leaven of self-commendation, that,\r\nsince my short sojourn in these heathenish abodes, much good seed has been\r\nscattered by the wayside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tribes are fonder of the chase than of the arts of men of\r\nlabor,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the unconscious Duncan, still gazing at the objects of\r\nhis wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is rather joy than labor to the spirit, to lift up the voice in\r\npraise; but sadly do these boys abuse their gifts. Rarely have I found any of\r\ntheir age, on whom nature has so freely bestowed the elements of psalmody; and\r\nsurely, surely, there are none who neglect them more. Three nights have I now\r\ntarried here, and three several times have I assembled the urchins to join in\r\nsacred song; and as often have they responded to my efforts with whoopings and\r\nhowlings that have chilled my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf whom speak you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf those children of the devil, who waste the precious moments in yonder\r\nidle antics. Ah! the wholesome restraint of discipline is but little known\r\namong this self-abandoned people. In a country of birches, a rod is never seen,\r\nand it ought not to appear a marvel in my eyes, that the choicest blessings of\r\nProvidence are wasted in such cries as these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid closed his ears against the juvenile pack, whose yell just then rang\r\nshrilly through the forest; and Duncan, suffering his lip to curl, as in\r\nmockery of his own superstition, said firmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout removing the safeguards form his ears, the master of song complied, and\r\ntogether they pursued their way toward what David was sometimes wont to call\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9ctents of the Philistines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut though the beast of game\r\nThe privilege of chase may claim;\r\nThough space and law the stag we lend\r\nEre hound we slip, or bow we bend;\r\nWhoever recked, where, how, or when\r\nThe prowling fox was trapped or slain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lady of the Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unusual to find an encampment of the natives, like those of the more\r\ninstructed whites, guarded by the presence of armed men. Well informed of the\r\napproach of every danger, while it is yet at a distance, the Indian generally\r\nrests secure under his knowledge of the signs of the forest, and the long and\r\ndifficult paths that separate him from those he has most reason to dread. But\r\nthe enemy who, by any lucky concurrence of accidents, has found means to elude\r\nthe vigilance of the scouts, will seldom meet with sentinels nearer home to\r\nsound the alarm. In addition to this general usage, the tribes friendly to the\r\nFrench knew too well the weight of the blow that had just been struck, to\r\napprehend any immediate danger from the hostile nations that were tributary to\r\nthe crown of Britain.\r\n\r\nWhen Duncan and David, therefore, found themselves in the center of the\r\nchildren, who played the antics already mentioned, it was without the least\r\nprevious intimation of their approach. But so soon as they were observed the\r\nwhole of the juvenile pack raised, by common consent, a shrill and warning\r\nwhoop; and then sank, as it were, by magic, from before the sight of their\r\nvisitors. The naked, tawny bodies of the crouching urchins blended so nicely at\r\nthat hour, with the withered herbage, that at first it seemed as if the earth\r\nhad, in truth, swallowed up their forms; though when surprise permitted Duncan\r\nto bend his look more curiously about the spot, he found it everywhere met by\r\ndark, quick, and rolling eyeballs.\r\n\r\nGathering no encouragement from this startling presage of the nature of the\r\nscrutiny he was likely to undergo from the more mature judgments of the men,\r\nthere was an instant when the young soldier would have retreated. It was,\r\nhowever, too late to appear to hesitate. The cry of the children had drawn a\r\ndozen warriors to the door of the nearest lodge, where they stood clustered in\r\na dark and savage group, gravely awaiting the nearer approach of those who had\r\nunexpectedly come among them.\r\n\r\nDavid, in some measure familiarized to the scene, led the way with a steadiness\r\nthat no slight obstacle was likely to disconcert, into this very building. It\r\nwas the principal edifice of the village, though roughly constructed of the\r\nbark and branches of trees; being the lodge in which the tribe held its\r\ncouncils and public meetings during their temporary residence on the borders of\r\nthe English province. Duncan found it difficult to assume the necessary\r\nappearance of unconcern, as he brushed the dark and powerful frames of the\r\nsavages who thronged its threshold; but, conscious that his existence depended\r\non his presence of mind, he trusted to the discretion of his companion, whose\r\nfootsteps he closely followed, endeavoring, as he proceeded, to rally his\r\nthoughts for the occasion. His blood curdled when he found himself in absolute\r\ncontact with such fierce and implacable enemies; but he so far mastered his\r\nfeelings as to pursue his way into the center of the lodge, with an exterior\r\nthat did not betray the weakness. Imitating the example of the deliberate\r\nGamut, he drew a bundle of fragrant brush from beneath a pile that filled the\r\ncorner of the hut, and seated himself in silence.\r\n\r\nSo soon as their visitor had passed, the observant warriors fell back from the\r\nentrance, and arranging themselves about him, they seemed patiently to await\r\nthe moment when it might comport with the dignity of the stranger to speak. By\r\nfar the greater number stood leaning, in lazy, lounging attitudes, against the\r\nupright posts that supported the crazy building, while three or four of the\r\noldest and most distinguished of the chiefs placed themselves on the earth a\r\nlittle more in advance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA flaring torch was burning in the place, and set its red glare from face to\r\nface and figure to figure, as it waved in the currents of air. Duncan profited\r\nby its light to read the probable character of his reception, in the\r\ncountenances of his hosts. But his ingenuity availed him little, against the\r\ncold artifices of the people he had encountered. The chiefs in front scarce\r\ncast a glance at his person, keeping their eyes on the ground, with an air that\r\nmight have been intended for respect, but which it was quite easy to construe\r\ninto distrust. The men in the shadow were less reserved. Duncan soon detected\r\ntheir searching, but stolen, looks which, in truth, scanned his person and\r\nattire inch by inch; leaving no emotion of the countenance, no gesture, no line\r\nof the paint, nor even the fashion of a garment, unheeded, and without comment.\r\n\r\nAt length one whose hair was beginning to be sprinkled with gray, but whose\r\nsinewy limbs and firm tread announced that he was still equal to the duties of\r\nmanhood, advanced out of the gloom of a corner, whither he had probably posted\r\nhimself to make his observations unseen, and spoke. He used the language of the\r\nWyandots, or Hurons; his words were, consequently, unintelligible to Heyward,\r\nthough they seemed, by the gestures that accompanied them, to be uttered more\r\nin courtesy than anger. The latter shook his head, and made a gesture\r\nindicative of his inability to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo none of my brothers speak the French or the English?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nin the former language, looking about him from countenance to countenance, in\r\nhopes of finding a nod of assent.\r\n\r\nThough more than one had turned, as if to catch the meaning of his words, they\r\nremained unanswered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be grieved to think,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Duncan, speaking slowly,\r\nand using the simplest French of which he was the master, \xe2\x80\x9cto believe\r\nthat none of this wise and brave nation understand the language that the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grand Monarque\xe2\x80\x99 uses when he talks to his children. His heart\r\nwould be heavy did he believe his red warriors paid him so little\r\nrespect!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long and grave pause succeeded, during which no movement of a limb, nor any\r\nexpression of an eye, betrayed the expression produced by his remark. Duncan,\r\nwho knew that silence was a virtue among his hosts, gladly had recourse to the\r\ncustom, in order to arrange his ideas. At length the same warrior who had\r\nbefore addressed him replied, by dryly demanding, in the language of the\r\nCanadas:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen our Great Father speaks to his people, is it with the tongue of a\r\nHuron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows no difference in his children, whether the color of the skin be\r\nred, or black, or white,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Duncan, evasively; \xe2\x80\x9cthough\r\nchiefly is he satisfied with the brave Hurons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what manner will he speak,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the wary chief,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen the runners count to him the scalps which five nights ago grew on\r\nthe heads of the Yengeese?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were his enemies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, shuddering involuntarily;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand doubtless, he will say, it is good; my Hurons are very\r\ngallant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Canada father does not think it. Instead of looking forward to\r\nreward his Indians, his eyes are turned backward. He sees the dead Yengeese,\r\nbut no Huron. What can this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great chief, like him, has more thoughts than tongues. He looks to see\r\nthat no enemies are on his trail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe canoe of a dead warrior will not float on the Horican,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the savage, gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cHis ears are open to the Delawares, who\r\nare not our friends, and they fill them with lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be. See; he has bid me, who am a man that knows the art of\r\nhealing, to go to his children, the red Hurons of the great lakes, and ask if\r\nany are sick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother silence succeeded this annunciation of the character Duncan had\r\nassumed. Every eye was simultaneously bent on his person, as if to inquire into\r\nthe truth or falsehood of the declaration, with an intelligence and keenness\r\nthat caused the subject of their scrutiny to tremble for the result. He was,\r\nhowever, relieved again by the former speaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo the cunning men of the Canadas paint their skins?\xe2\x80\x9d the Huron\r\ncoldly continued; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have heard them boast that their faces were\r\npale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen an Indian chief comes among his white fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nDuncan, with great steadiness, \xe2\x80\x9che lays aside his buffalo robe, to carry\r\nthe shirt that is offered him. My brothers have given me paint and I wear\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA low murmur of applause announced that the compliment of the tribe was\r\nfavorably received. The elderly chief made a gesture of commendation, which was\r\nanswered by most of his companions, who each threw forth a hand and uttered a\r\nbrief exclamation of pleasure. Duncan began to breathe more freely, believing\r\nthat the weight of his examination was past; and, as he had already prepared a\r\nsimple and probable tale to support his pretended occupation, his hopes of\r\nultimate success grew brighter.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence of a few moments, as if adjusting his thoughts, in order to\r\nmake a suitable answer to the declaration their guests had just given, another\r\nwarrior arose, and placed himself in an attitude to speak. While his lips were\r\nyet in the act of parting, a low but fearful sound arose from the forest, and\r\nwas immediately succeeded by a high, shrill yell, that was drawn out, until it\r\nequaled the longest and most plaintive howl of the wolf. The sudden and\r\nterrible interruption caused Duncan to start from his seat, unconscious of\r\neverything but the effect produced by so frightful a cry. At the same moment,\r\nthe warriors glided in a body from the lodge, and the outer air was filled with\r\nloud shouts, that nearly drowned those awful sounds, which were still ringing\r\nbeneath the arches of the woods. Unable to command himself any longer, the\r\nyouth broke from the place, and presently stood in the center of a disorderly\r\nthrong, that included nearly everything having life, within the limits of the\r\nencampment. Men, women, and children; the aged, the inform, the active, and the\r\nstrong, were alike abroad, some exclaiming aloud, others clapping their hands\r\nwith a joy that seemed frantic, and all expressing their savage pleasure in\r\nsome unexpected event. Though astounded, at first, by the uproar, Heyward was\r\nsoon enabled to find its solution by the scene that followed.\r\n\r\nThere yet lingered sufficient light in the heavens to exhibit those bright\r\nopenings among the tree-tops, where different paths left the clearing to enter\r\nthe depths of the wilderness. Beneath one of them, a line of warriors issued\r\nfrom the woods, and advanced slowly toward the dwellings. One in front bore a\r\nshort pole, on which, as it afterwards appeared, were suspended several human\r\nscalps. The startling sounds that Duncan had heard were what the whites have\r\nnot inappropriately called the \xe2\x80\x9cdeath-hallo\xe2\x80\x9d; and each repetition\r\nof the cry was intended to announce to the tribe the fate of an enemy. Thus far\r\nthe knowledge of Heyward assisted him in the explanation; and as he now knew\r\nthat the interruption was caused by the unlooked-for return of a successful\r\nwar-party, every disagreeable sensation was quieted in inward congratulation,\r\nfor the opportune relief and insignificance it conferred on himself.\r\n\r\nWhen at the distance of a few hundred feet from the lodges the newly arrived\r\nwarriors halted. Their plaintive and terrific cry, which was intended to\r\nrepresent equally the wailings of the dead and the triumph to the victors, had\r\nentirely ceased. One of their number now called aloud, in words that were far\r\nfrom appalling, though not more intelligible to those for whose ears they were\r\nintended, than their expressive yells. It would be difficult to convey a\r\nsuitable idea of the savage ecstasy with which the news thus imparted was\r\nreceived. The whole encampment, in a moment, became a scene of the most violent\r\nbustle and commotion. The warriors drew their knives, and flourishing them,\r\nthey arranged themselves in two lines, forming a lane that extended from the\r\nwar-party to the lodges. The squaws seized clubs, axes, or whatever weapon of\r\noffense first offered itself to their hands, and rushed eagerly to act their\r\npart in the cruel game that was at hand. Even the children would not be\r\nexcluded; but boys, little able to wield the instruments, tore the tomahawks\r\nfrom the belts of their fathers, and stole into the ranks, apt imitators of the\r\nsavage traits exhibited by their parents.\r\n\r\nLarge piles of brush lay scattered about the clearing, and a wary and aged\r\nsquaw was occupied in firing as many as might serve to light the coming\r\nexhibition. As the flame arose, its power exceeded that of the parting day, and\r\nassisted to render objects at the same time more distinct and more hideous. The\r\nwhole scene formed a striking picture, whose frame was composed of the dark and\r\ntall border of pines. The warriors just arrived were the most distant figures.\r\nA little in advance stood two men, who were apparently selected from the rest,\r\nas the principal actors in what was to follow. The light was not strong enough\r\nto render their features distinct, though it was quite evident that they were\r\ngoverned by very different emotions. While one stood erect and firm, prepared\r\nto meet his fate like a hero, the other bowed his head, as if palsied by terror\r\nor stricken with shame. The high-spirited Duncan felt a powerful impulse of\r\nadmiration and pity toward the former, though no opportunity could offer to\r\nexhibit his generous emotions. He watched his slightest movement, however, with\r\neager eyes; and, as he traced the fine outline of his admirably proportioned\r\nand active frame, he endeavored to persuade himself, that, if the powers of\r\nman, seconded by such noble resolution, could bear one harmless through so\r\nsevere a trial, the youthful captive before him might hope for success in the\r\nhazardous race he was about to run. Insensibly the young man drew nigher to the\r\nswarthy lines of the Hurons, and scarcely breathed, so intense became his\r\ninterest in the spectacle. Just then the signal yell was given, and the\r\nmomentary quiet which had preceded it was broken by a burst of cries, that far\r\nexceeded any before heard. The more abject of the two victims continued\r\nmotionless; but the other bounded from the place at the cry, with the activity\r\nand swiftness of a deer. Instead of rushing through the hostile lines, as had\r\nbeen expected, he just entered the dangerous defile, and before time was given\r\nfor a single blow, turned short, and leaping the heads of a row of children, he\r\ngained at once the exterior and safer side of the formidable array. The\r\nartifice was answered by a hundred voices raised in imprecations; and the whole\r\nof the excited multitude broke from their order, and spread themselves about\r\nthe place in wild confusion.\r\n\r\nA dozen blazing piles now shed their lurid brightness on the place, which\r\nresembled some unhallowed and supernatural arena, in which malicious demons had\r\nassembled to act their bloody and lawless rites. The forms in the background\r\nlooked like unearthly beings, gliding before the eye, and cleaving the air with\r\nfrantic and unmeaning gestures; while the savage passions of such as passed the\r\nflames were rendered fearfully distinct by the gleams that shot athwart their\r\ninflamed visages.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be understood that, amid such a concourse of vindictive enemies,\r\nno breathing time was allowed the fugitive. There was a single moment when it\r\nseemed as if he would have reached the forest, but the whole body of his\r\ncaptors threw themselves before him, and drove him back into the center of his\r\nrelentless persecutors. Turning like a headed deer, he shot, with the swiftness\r\nof an arrow, through a pillar of forked flame, and passing the whole multitude\r\nharmless, he appeared on the opposite side of the clearing. Here, too, he was\r\nmet and turned by a few of the older and more subtle of the Hurons. Once more\r\nhe tried the throng, as if seeking safety in its blindness, and then several\r\nmoments succeeded, during which Duncan believed the active and courageous young\r\nstranger was lost.\r\n\r\nNothing could be distinguished but a dark mass of human forms tossed and\r\ninvolved in inexplicable confusion. Arms, gleaming knives, and formidable\r\nclubs, appeared above them, but the blows were evidently given at random. The\r\nawful effect was heightened by the piercing shrieks of the women and the fierce\r\nyells of the warriors. Now and then Duncan caught a glimpse of a light form\r\ncleaving the air in some desperate bound, and he rather hoped than believed\r\nthat the captive yet retained the command of his astonishing powers of\r\nactivity. Suddenly the multitude rolled backward, and approached the spot where\r\nhe himself stood. The heavy body in the rear pressed upon the women and\r\nchildren in front, and bore them to the earth. The stranger reappeared in the\r\nconfusion. Human power could not, however, much longer endure so severe a\r\ntrial. Of this the captive seemed conscious. Profiting by the momentary\r\nopening, he darted from among the warriors, and made a desperate, and what\r\nseemed to Duncan a final effort to gain the wood. As if aware that no danger\r\nwas to be apprehended from the young soldier, the fugitive nearly brushed his\r\nperson in his flight. A tall and powerful Huron, who had husbanded his forces,\r\npressed close upon his heels, and with an uplifted arm menaced a fatal blow.\r\nDuncan thrust forth a foot, and the shock precipitated the eager savage\r\nheadlong, many feet in advance of his intended victim. Thought itself is not\r\nquicker than was the motion with which the latter profited by the advantage; he\r\nturned, gleamed like a meteor again before the eyes of Duncan, and, at the next\r\nmoment, when the latter recovered his recollection, and gazed around in quest\r\nof the captive, he saw him quietly leaning against a small painted post, which\r\nstood before the door of the principal lodge.\r\n\r\nApprehensive that the part he had taken in the escape might prove fatal to\r\nhimself, Duncan left the place without delay. He followed the crowd, which drew\r\nnigh the lodges, gloomy and sullen, like any other multitude that had been\r\ndisappointed in an execution. Curiosity, or perhaps a better feeling, induced\r\nhim to approach the stranger. He found him, standing with one arm cast about\r\nthe protecting post, and breathing thick and hard, after his exertions, but\r\ndisdaining to permit a single sign of suffering to escape. His person was now\r\nprotected by immemorial and sacred usage, until the tribe in council had\r\ndeliberated and determined on his fate. It was not difficult, however, to\r\nforetell the result, if any presage could be drawn from the feelings of those\r\nwho crowded the place.\r\n\r\nThere was no term of abuse known to the Huron vocabulary that the disappointed\r\nwomen did not lavishly expend on the successful stranger. They flouted at his\r\nefforts, and told him, with bitter scoffs, that his feet were better than his\r\nhands; and that he merited wings, while he knew not the use of an arrow or a\r\nknife. To all this the captive made no reply; but was content to preserve an\r\nattitude in which dignity was singularly blended with disdain. Exasperated as\r\nmuch by his composure as by his good-fortune, their words became\r\nunintelligible, and were succeeded by shrill, piercing yells. Just then the\r\ncrafty squaw, who had taken the necessary precaution to fire the piles, made\r\nher way through the throng, and cleared a place for herself in front of the\r\ncaptive. The squalid and withered person of this hag might well have obtained\r\nfor her the character of possessing more than human cunning. Throwing back her\r\nlight vestment, she stretched forth her long, skinny arm, in derision, and\r\nusing the language of the Lenape, as more intelligible to the subject of her\r\ngibes, she commenced aloud:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you, Delaware,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, snapping her fingers in his face;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour nation is a race of women, and the hoe is better fitted to your\r\nhands than the gun. Your squaws are the mothers of deer; but if a bear, or a\r\nwildcat, or a serpent were born among you, ye would flee. The Huron girls shall\r\nmake you petticoats, and we will find you a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA burst of savage laughter succeeded this attack, during which the soft and\r\nmusical merriment of the younger females strangely chimed with the cracked\r\nvoice of their older and more malignant companion. But the stranger was\r\nsuperior to all their efforts. His head was immovable; nor did he betray the\r\nslightest consciousness that any were present, except when his haughty eye\r\nrolled toward the dusky forms of the warriors, who stalked in the background\r\nsilent and sullen observers of the scene.\r\n\r\nInfuriated at the self-command of the captive, the woman placed her arms\r\nakimbo; and, throwing herself into a posture of defiance, she broke out anew,\r\nin a torrent of words that no art of ours could commit successfully to paper.\r\nHer breath was, however, expended in vain; for, although distinguished in her\r\nnation as a proficient in the art of abuse, she was permitted to work herself\r\ninto such a fury as actually to foam at the mouth, without causing a muscle to\r\nvibrate in the motionless figure of the stranger. The effect of his\r\nindifference began to extend itself to the other spectators; and a youngster,\r\nwho was just quitting the condition of a boy to enter the state of manhood,\r\nattempted to assist the termagant, by flourishing his tomahawk before their\r\nvictim, and adding his empty boasts to the taunts of the women. Then, indeed,\r\nthe captive turned his face toward the light, and looked down on the stripling\r\nwith an expression that was superior to contempt. At the next moment he resumed\r\nhis quiet and reclining attitude against the post. But the change of posture\r\nhad permitted Duncan to exchange glances with the firm and piercing eyes of\r\nUncas.\r\n\r\nBreathless with amazement, and heavily oppressed with the critical situation of\r\nhis friend, Heyward recoiled before the look, trembling lest its meaning might,\r\nin some unknown manner, hasten the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s fate. There was not,\r\nhowever, any instant cause for such an apprehension. Just then a warrior forced\r\nhis way into the exasperated crowd. Motioning the women and children aside with\r\na stern gesture, he took Uncas by the arm, and led him toward the door of the\r\ncouncil-lodge. Thither all the chiefs, and most of the distinguished warriors,\r\nfollowed; among whom the anxious Heyward found means to enter without\r\nattracting any dangerous attention to himself.\r\n\r\nA few minutes were consumed in disposing of those present in a manner suitable\r\nto their rank and influence in the tribe. An order very similar to that adopted\r\nin the preceding interview was observed; the aged and superior chiefs occupying\r\nthe area of the spacious apartment, within the powerful light of a glaring\r\ntorch, while their juniors and inferiors were arranged in the background,\r\npresenting a dark outline of swarthy and marked visages. In the very center of\r\nthe lodge, immediately under an opening that admitted the twinkling light of\r\none or two stars, stood Uncas, calm, elevated, and collected. His high and\r\nhaughty carriage was not lost on his captors, who often bent their looks on his\r\nperson, with eyes which, while they lost none of their inflexibility of\r\npurpose, plainly betrayed their admiration of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s daring.\r\n\r\nThe case was different with the individual whom Duncan had observed to stand\r\nforth with his friend, previously to the desperate trial of speed; and who,\r\ninstead of joining in the chase, had remained, throughout its turbulent uproar,\r\nlike a cringing statue, expressive of shame and disgrace. Though not a hand had\r\nbeen extended to greet him, nor yet an eye had condescended to watch his\r\nmovements, he had also entered the lodge, as though impelled by a fate to whose\r\ndecrees he submitted, seemingly, without a struggle. Heyward profited by the\r\nfirst opportunity to gaze in his face, secretly apprehensive he might find the\r\nfeatures of another acquaintance; but they proved to be those of a stranger,\r\nand, what was still more inexplicable, of one who bore all the distinctive\r\nmarks of a Huron warrior. Instead of mingling with his tribe, however, he sat\r\napart, a solitary being in a multitude, his form shrinking into a crouching and\r\nabject attitude, as if anxious to fill as little space as possible. When each\r\nindividual had taken his proper station, and silence reigned in the place, the\r\ngray-haired chief already introduced to the reader, spoke aloud, in the\r\nlanguage of the Lenni Lenape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelaware,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthough one of a nation of women, you\r\nhave proved yourself a man. I would give you food; but he who eats with a Huron\r\nshould become his friend. Rest in peace till the morning sun, when our last\r\nwords shall be spoken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven nights, and as many summer days, have I fasted on the trail of the\r\nHurons,\xe2\x80\x9d Uncas coldly replied; \xe2\x80\x9cthe children of the Lenape know how\r\nto travel the path of the just without lingering to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo of my young men are in pursuit of your companion,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the\r\nother, without appearing to regard the boast of his captive; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they\r\nget back, then will our wise man say to you \xe2\x80\x98live\xe2\x80\x99 or\r\n\xe2\x80\x98die\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas a Huron no ears?\xe2\x80\x9d scornfully exclaimed Uncas; \xe2\x80\x9ctwice,\r\nsince he has been your prisoner, has the Delaware heard a gun that he knows.\r\nYour young men will never come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA short and sullen pause succeeded this bold assertion. Duncan, who understood\r\nthe Mohican to allude to the fatal rifle of the scout, bent forward in earnest\r\nobservation of the effect it might produce on the conquerors; but the chief was\r\ncontent with simply retorting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Lenape are so skillful, why is one of their bravest warriors\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe followed in the steps of a flying coward, and fell into a snare. The\r\ncunning beaver may be caught.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Uncas thus replied, he pointed with his finger toward the solitary Huron,\r\nbut without deigning to bestow any other notice on so unworthy an object. The\r\nwords of the answer and the air of the speaker produced a strong sensation\r\namong his auditors. Every eye rolled sullenly toward the individual indicated\r\nby the simple gesture, and a low, threatening murmur passed through the crowd.\r\nThe ominous sounds reached the outer door, and the women and children pressing\r\ninto the throng, no gap had been left, between shoulder and shoulder, that was\r\nnot now filled with the dark lineaments of some eager and curious human\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the more aged chiefs, in the center, communed with each other\r\nin short and broken sentences. Not a word was uttered that did not convey the\r\nmeaning of the speaker, in the simplest and most energetic form. Again, a long\r\nand deeply solemn pause took place. It was known, by all present, to be the\r\nbrave precursor of a weighty and important judgment. They who composed the\r\nouter circle of faces were on tiptoe to gaze; and even the culprit for an\r\ninstant forgot his shame in a deeper emotion, and exposed his abject features,\r\nin order to cast an anxious and troubled glance at the dark assemblage of\r\nchiefs. The silence was finally broken by the aged warrior so often named. He\r\narose from the earth, and moving past the immovable form of Uncas, placed\r\nhimself in a dignified attitude before the offender. At that moment, the\r\nwithered squaw already mentioned moved into the circle, in a slow, sidling sort\r\nof a dance, holding the torch, and muttering the indistinct words of what might\r\nhave been a species of incantation. Though her presence was altogether an\r\nintrusion, it was unheeded.\r\n\r\nApproaching Uncas, she held the blazing brand in such a manner as to cast its\r\nred glare on his person, and to expose the slightest emotion of his\r\ncountenance. The Mohican maintained his firm and haughty attitude; and his\r\neyes, so far from deigning to meet her inquisitive look, dwelt steadily on the\r\ndistance, as though it penetrated the obstacles which impeded the view and\r\nlooked into futurity. Satisfied with her examination, she left him, with a\r\nslight expression of pleasure, and proceeded to practise the same trying\r\nexperiment on her delinquent countryman.\r\n\r\nThe young Huron was in his war paint, and very little of a finely molded form\r\nwas concealed by his attire. The light rendered every limb and joint\r\ndiscernible, and Duncan turned away in horror when he saw they were writhing in\r\nirrepressible agony. The woman was commencing a low and plaintive howl at the\r\nsad and shameful spectacle, when the chief put forth his hand and gently pushed\r\nher aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReed-that-bends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the young culprit by name,\r\nand in his proper language, \xe2\x80\x9cthough the Great Spirit has made you\r\npleasant to the eyes, it would have been better that you had not been born.\r\nYour tongue is loud in the village, but in battle it is still. None of my young\r\nmen strike the tomahawk deeper into the war-post\xe2\x80\x94none of them so lightly\r\non the Yengeese. The enemy know the shape of your back, but they have never\r\nseen the color of your eyes. Three times have they called on you to come, and\r\nas often did you forget to answer. Your name will never be mentioned again in\r\nyour tribe\xe2\x80\x94it is already forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the chief slowly uttered these words, pausing impressively between each\r\nsentence, the culprit raised his face, in deference to the other\xe2\x80\x99s rank\r\nand years. Shame, horror, and pride struggled in its lineaments. His eye, which\r\nwas contracted with inward anguish, gleamed on the persons of those whose\r\nbreath was his fame; and the latter emotion for an instant predominated. He\r\narose to his feet, and baring his bosom, looked steadily on the keen,\r\nglittering knife, that was already upheld by his inexorable judge. As the\r\nweapon passed slowly into his heart he even smiled, as if in joy at having\r\nfound death less dreadful than he had anticipated, and fell heavily on his\r\nface, at the feet of the rigid and unyielding form of Uncas.\r\n\r\nThe squaw gave a loud and plaintive yell, dashed the torch to the earth, and\r\nburied everything in darkness. The whole shuddering group of spectators glided\r\nfrom the lodge like troubled sprites; and Duncan thought that he and the yet\r\nthrobbing body of the victim of an Indian judgment had now become its only\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus spoke the sage: the kings without delay\r\nDissolve the council, and their chief obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Iliad\r\n\r\n\r\nA single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken. A hand was\r\nlaid, with a powerful pressure, on his arm, and the low voice of Uncas muttered\r\nin his ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hurons are dogs. The sight of a coward\xe2\x80\x99s blood can never make\r\na warrior tremble. The \xe2\x80\x98Gray Head\xe2\x80\x99 and the Sagamore are safe, and\r\nthe rifle of Hawkeye is not asleep. Go\xe2\x80\x94Uncas and the \xe2\x80\x98Open\r\nHand\xe2\x80\x99 are now strangers. It is enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward would gladly have heard more, but a gentle push from his friend urged\r\nhim toward the door, and admonished him of the danger that might attend the\r\ndiscovery of their intercourse. Slowly and reluctantly yielding to the\r\nnecessity, he quitted the place, and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh.\r\nThe dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and uncertain light on the dusky\r\nfigures that were silently stalking to and fro; and occasionally a brighter\r\ngleam than common glanced into the lodge, and exhibited the figure of Uncas\r\nstill maintaining its upright attitude near the dead body of the Huron.\r\n\r\nA knot of warriors soon entered the place again, and reissuing, they bore the\r\nsenseless remains into the adjacent woods. After this termination of the scene,\r\nDuncan wandered among the lodges, unquestioned and unnoticed, endeavoring to\r\nfind some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran. In the\r\npresent temper of the tribe it would have been easy to have fled and rejoined\r\nhis companions, had such a wish crossed his mind. But, in addition to the\r\nnever-ceasing anxiety on account of Alice, a fresher though feebler interest in\r\nthe fate of Uncas assisted to chain him to the spot. He continued, therefore,\r\nto stray from hut to hut, looking into each only to encounter additional\r\ndisappointment, until he had made the entire circuit of the village. Abandoning\r\na species of inquiry that proved so fruitless, he retraced his steps to the\r\ncouncil-lodge, resolved to seek and question David, in order to put an end to\r\nhis doubts.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the building, which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the\r\nplace of execution, the young man found that the excitement had already\r\nsubsided. The warriors had reassembled, and were now calmly smoking, while they\r\nconversed gravely on the chief incidents of their recent expedition to the head\r\nof the Horican. Though the return of Duncan was likely to remind them of his\r\ncharacter, and the suspicious circumstances of his visit, it produced no\r\nvisible sensation. So far, the terrible scene that had just occurred proved\r\nfavorable to his views, and he required no other prompter than his own feelings\r\nto convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage.\r\n\r\nWithout seeming to hesitate, he walked into the lodge, and took his seat with a\r\ngravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts. A hasty but\r\nsearching glance sufficed to tell him that, though Uncas still remained where\r\nhe had left him, David had not reappeared. No other restraint was imposed on\r\nthe former than the watchful looks of a young Huron, who had placed himself at\r\nhand; though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of\r\nthe narrow doorway. In every other respect, the captive seemed at liberty;\r\nstill he was excluded from all participation in the discourse, and possessed\r\nmuch more of the air of some finely molded statue than a man having life and\r\nvolition.\r\n\r\nHeyward had too recently witnessed a frightful instance of the prompt\r\npunishments of the people into whose hands he had fallen to hazard an exposure\r\nby any officious boldness. He would greatly have preferred silence and\r\nmeditation to speech, when a discovery of his real condition might prove so\r\ninstantly fatal. Unfortunately for this prudent resolution, his entertainers\r\nappeared otherwise disposed. He had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a\r\nlittle in the shade, when another of the elder warriors, who spoke the French\r\nlanguage, addressed him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Canada father does not forget his children,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chief;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank him. An evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men.\r\nCan the cunning stranger frighten him away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the Indians, in\r\nthe cases of such supposed visitations. He saw, at a glance, that the\r\ncircumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends. It would,\r\ntherefore, have been difficult, just then to have uttered a proposal that would\r\nhave given him more satisfaction. Aware of the necessity of preserving the\r\ndignity of his imaginary character, however, he repressed his feelings, and\r\nanswered with suitable mystery:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpirits differ; some yield to the power of wisdom, while others are too\r\nstrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother is a great medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cunning savage;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che will try?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gesture of assent was the answer. The Huron was content with the assurance,\r\nand, resuming his pipe, he awaited the proper moment to move. The impatient\r\nHeyward, inwardly execrating the cold customs of the savages, which required\r\nsuch sacrifices to appearance, was fain to assume an air of indifference, equal\r\nto that maintained by the chief, who was, in truth, a near relative of the\r\nafflicted woman. The minutes lingered, and the delay had seemed an hour to the\r\nadventurer in empiricism, when the Huron laid aside his pipe and drew his robe\r\nacross his breast, as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid.\r\nJust then, a warrior of powerful frame, darkened the door, and stalking\r\nsilently among the attentive group, he seated himself on one end of the low\r\npile of brush which sustained Duncan. The latter cast an impatient look at his\r\nneighbor, and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found\r\nhimself in actual contact with Magua.\r\n\r\nThe sudden return of this artful and dreaded chief caused a delay in the\r\ndeparture of the Huron. Several pipes, that had been extinguished, were lighted\r\nagain; while the newcomer, without speaking a word, drew his tomahawk from his\r\ngirdle, and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed\r\nthrough the hollow handle, with as much indifference as if he had not been\r\nabsent two weary days on a long and toilsome hunt. Ten minutes, which appeared\r\nso many ages to Duncan, might have passed in this manner; and the warriors were\r\nfairly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome!\xe2\x80\x9d one at length uttered; \xe2\x80\x9chas my friend found the\r\nmoose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young men stagger under their burdens,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Magua.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x98Reed-that-bends\xe2\x80\x99 go on the hunting path; he will meet\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name. Each\r\npipe dropped from the lips of its owner as though all had inhaled an impurity\r\nat the same instant. The smoke wreathed above their heads in little eddies, and\r\ncurling in a spiral form it ascended swiftly through the opening in the roof of\r\nthe lodge, leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes, and each dark visage\r\ndistinctly visible. The looks of most of the warriors were riveted on the\r\nearth; though a few of the younger and less gifted of the party suffered their\r\nwild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a white-headed savage,\r\nwho sat between two of the most venerated chiefs of the tribe. There was\r\nnothing in the air or attire of this Indian that would seem to entitle him to\r\nsuch a distinction. The former was rather depressed, than remarkable for the\r\nbearing of the natives; and the latter was such as was commonly worn by the\r\nordinary men of the nation. Like most around him for more than a minute his\r\nlook, too, was on the ground; but, trusting his eyes at length to steal a\r\nglance aside, he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention.\r\nThen he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI had no son. He who was called by\r\nthat name is forgotten; his blood was pale, and it came not from the veins of a\r\nHuron; the wicked Chippewas cheated my squaw. The Great Spirit has said, that\r\nthe family of Wiss-entush should end; he is happy who knows that the evil of\r\nhis race dies with himself. I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker, who was the father of the recreant young Indian, looked round and\r\nabout him, as if seeking commendation of his stoicism in the eyes of the\r\nauditors. But the stern customs of his people had made too severe an exaction\r\nof the feeble old man. The expression of his eye contradicted his figurative\r\nand boastful language, while every muscle in his wrinkled visage was working\r\nwith anguish. Standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph, he turned\r\naway, as if sickening at the gaze of men, and, veiling his face in his blanket,\r\nhe walked from the lodge with the noiseless step of an Indian seeking, in the\r\nprivacy of his own abode, the sympathy of one like himself, aged, forlorn and\r\nchildless.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects\r\nin character, suffered him to depart in silence. Then, with an elevation of\r\nbreeding that many in a more cultivated state of society might profitably\r\nemulate, one of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men from the\r\nweakness they had just witnessed, by saying, in a cheerful voice, addressing\r\nhimself in courtesy to Magua, as the newest comer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Delawares have been like bears after the honey pots, prowling around\r\nmy village. But who has ever found a Huron asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not\r\nblacker than the brow of Magua as he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Delawares of the Lakes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so. They who wear the petticoats of squaws, on their own river. One\r\nof them has been passing the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid my young men take his scalp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis legs were good, though his arm is better for the hoe than the\r\ntomahawk,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, pointing to the immovable form of Uncas.\r\n\r\nInstead of manifesting any womanish curiosity to feast his eyes with the sight\r\nof a captive from a people he was known to have so much reason to hate, Magua\r\ncontinued to smoke, with the meditative air that he usually maintained, when\r\nthere was no immediate call on his cunning or his eloquence. Although secretly\r\namazed at the facts communicated by the speech of the aged father, he permitted\r\nhimself to ask no questions, reserving his inquiries for a more suitable\r\nmoment. It was only after a sufficient interval that he shook the ashes from\r\nhis pipe, replaced the tomahawk, tightened his girdle, and arose, casting for\r\nthe first time a glance in the direction of the prisoner, who stood a little\r\nbehind him. The wary, though seemingly abstracted Uncas, caught a glimpse of\r\nthe movement, and turning suddenly to the light, their looks met. Near a minute\r\nthese two bold and untamed spirits stood regarding one another steadily in the\r\neye, neither quailing in the least before the fierce gaze he encountered. The\r\nform of Uncas dilated, and his nostrils opened like those of a tiger at bay;\r\nbut so rigid and unyielding was his posture, that he might easily have been\r\nconverted by the imagination into an exquisite and faultless representation of\r\nthe warlike deity of his tribe. The lineaments of the quivering features of\r\nMagua proved more ductile; his countenance gradually lost its character of\r\ndefiance in an expression of ferocious joy, and heaving a breath from the very\r\nbottom of his chest, he pronounced aloud the formidable name of:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Cerf Agile!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach warrior sprang upon his feet at the utterance of the well-known\r\nappellation, and there was a short period during which the stoical constancy of\r\nthe natives was completely conquered by surprise. The hated and yet respected\r\nname was repeated as by one voice, carrying the sound even beyond the limits of\r\nthe lodge. The women and children, who lingered around the entrance, took up\r\nthe words in an echo, which was succeeded by another shrill and plaintive howl.\r\nThe latter was not yet ended, when the sensation among the men had entirely\r\nabated. Each one in presence seated himself, as though ashamed of his\r\nprecipitation; but it was many minutes before their meaning eyes ceased to roll\r\ntoward their captive, in curious examination of a warrior who had so often\r\nproved his prowess on the best and proudest of their nation. Uncas enjoyed his\r\nvictory, but was content with merely exhibiting his triumph by a quiet\r\nsmile\xe2\x80\x94an emblem of scorn which belongs to all time and every nation.\r\n\r\nMagua caught the expression, and raising his arm, he shook it at the captive,\r\nthe light silver ornaments attached to his bracelet rattling with the trembling\r\nagitation of the limb, as, in a tone of vengeance, he exclaimed, in English:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMohican, you die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe healing waters will never bring the dead Hurons to life,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Uncas, in the music of the Delawares; \xe2\x80\x9cthe tumbling river washes\r\ntheir bones; their men are squaws: their women owls. Go! call together the\r\nHuron dogs, that they may look upon a warrior, My nostrils are offended; they\r\nscent the blood of a coward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe latter allusion struck deep, and the injury rankled. Many of the Hurons\r\nunderstood the strange tongue in which the captive spoke, among which number\r\nwas Magua. This cunning savage beheld, and instantly profited by his advantage.\r\nDropping the light robe of skin from his shoulder, he stretched forth his arm,\r\nand commenced a burst of his dangerous and artful eloquence. However much his\r\ninfluence among his people had been impaired by his occasional and besetting\r\nweakness, as well as by his desertion of the tribe, his courage and his fame as\r\nan orator were undeniable. He never spoke without auditors, and rarely without\r\nmaking converts to his opinions. On the present occasion, his native powers\r\nwere stimulated by the thirst of revenge.\r\n\r\nHe again recounted the events of the attack on the island at Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s, the\r\ndeath of his associates and the escape of their most formidable enemies. Then\r\nhe described the nature and position of the mount whither he had led such\r\ncaptives as had fallen into their hands. Of his own bloody intentions toward\r\nthe maidens, and of his baffled malice he made no mention, but passed rapidly\r\non to the surprise of the party by \xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue Carabine,\xe2\x80\x9d and its\r\nfatal termination. Here he paused, and looked about him, in affected veneration\r\nfor the departed, but, in truth, to note the effect of his opening narrative.\r\nAs usual, every eye was riveted on his face. Each dusky figure seemed a\r\nbreathing statue, so motionless was the posture, so intense the attention of\r\nthe individual.\r\n\r\nThen Magua dropped his voice which had hitherto been clear, strong and\r\nelevated, and touched upon the merits of the dead. No quality that was likely\r\nto command the sympathy of an Indian escaped his notice. One had never been\r\nknown to follow the chase in vain; another had been indefatigable on the trail\r\nof their enemies. This was brave, that generous. In short, he so managed his\r\nallusions, that in a nation which was composed of so few families, he contrived\r\nto strike every chord that might find, in its turn, some breast in which to\r\nvibrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the bones of my young men,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cin the\r\nburial-place of the Hurons? You know they are not. Their spirits are gone\r\ntoward the setting sun, and are already crossing the great waters, to the happy\r\nhunting-grounds. But they departed without food, without guns or knives,\r\nwithout moccasins, naked and poor as they were born. Shall this be? Are their\r\nsouls to enter the land of the just like hungry Iroquois or unmanly Delawares,\r\nor shall they meet their friends with arms in their hands and robes on their\r\nbacks? What will our fathers think the tribes of the Wyandots have become? They\r\nwill look on their children with a dark eye, and say, \xe2\x80\x98Go! a Chippewa has\r\ncome hither with the name of a Huron.\xe2\x80\x99 Brothers, we must not forget the\r\ndead; a red-skin never ceases to remember. We will load the back of this\r\nMohican until he staggers under our bounty, and dispatch him after my young\r\nmen. They call to us for aid, though our ears are not open; they say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forget us not.\xe2\x80\x99 When they see the spirit of this Mohican toiling\r\nafter them with his burden, they will know we are of that mind. Then will they\r\ngo on happy; and our children will say, \xe2\x80\x98So did our fathers to their\r\nfriends, so must we do to them.\xe2\x80\x99 What is a Yengee? we have slain many,\r\nbut the earth is still pale. A stain on the name of Huron can only be hid by\r\nblood that comes from the veins of an Indian. Let this Delaware die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effect of such an harangue, delivered in the nervous language and with the\r\nemphatic manner of a Huron orator, could scarcely be mistaken. Magua had so\r\nartfully blended the natural sympathies with the religious superstition of his\r\nauditors, that their minds, already prepared by custom to sacrifice a victim to\r\nthe manes of their countrymen, lost every vestige of humanity in a wish for\r\nrevenge. One warrior in particular, a man of wild and ferocious mien, had been\r\nconspicuous for the attention he had given to the words of the speaker. His\r\ncountenance had changed with each passing emotion, until it settled into a look\r\nof deadly malice. As Magua ended he arose and, uttering the yell of a demon,\r\nhis polished little axe was seen glancing in the torchlight as he whirled it\r\nabove his head. The motion and the cry were too sudden for words to interrupt\r\nhis bloody intention. It appeared as if a bright gleam shot from his hand,\r\nwhich was crossed at the same moment by a dark and powerful line. The former\r\nwas the tomahawk in its passage; the latter the arm that Magua darted forward\r\nto divert its aim. The quick and ready motion of the chief was not entirely too\r\nlate. The keen weapon cut the war plume from the scalping tuft of Uncas, and\r\npassed through the frail wall of the lodge as though it were hurled from some\r\nformidable engine.\r\n\r\nDuncan had seen the threatening action, and sprang upon his feet, with a heart\r\nwhich, while it leaped into his throat, swelled with the most generous\r\nresolution in behalf of his friend. A glance told him that the blow had failed,\r\nand terror changed to admiration. Uncas stood still, looking his enemy in the\r\neye with features that seemed superior to emotion. Marble could not be colder,\r\ncalmer, or steadier than the countenance he put upon this sudden and vindictive\r\nattack. Then, as if pitying a want of skill which had proved so fortunate to\r\nhimself, he smiled, and muttered a few words of contempt in his own tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Magua, after satisfying himself of the safety of the\r\ncaptive; \xe2\x80\x9cthe sun must shine on his shame; the squaws must see his flesh\r\ntremble, or our revenge will be like the play of boys. Go! take him where there\r\nis silence; let us see if a Delaware can sleep at night, and in the morning\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young men whose duty it was to guard the prisoner instantly passed their\r\nligaments of bark across his arms, and led him from the lodge, amid a profound\r\nand ominous silence. It was only as the figure of Uncas stood in the opening of\r\nthe door that his firm step hesitated. There he turned, and, in the sweeping\r\nand haughty glance that he threw around the circle of his enemies, Duncan\r\ncaught a look which he was glad to construe into an expression that he was not\r\nentirely deserted by hope.\r\n\r\nMagua was content with his success, or too much occupied with his secret\r\npurposes to push his inquiries any further. Shaking his mantle, and folding it\r\non his bosom, he also quitted the place, without pursuing a subject which might\r\nhave proved so fatal to the individual at his elbow. Notwithstanding his rising\r\nresentment, his natural firmness, and his anxiety on behalf of Uncas, Heyward\r\nfelt sensibly relieved by the absence of so dangerous and so subtle a foe. The\r\nexcitement produced by the speech gradually subsided. The warriors resumed\r\ntheir seats and clouds of smoke once more filled the lodge. For near half an\r\nhour, not a syllable was uttered, or scarcely a look cast aside; a grave and\r\nmeditative silence being the ordinary succession to every scene of violence and\r\ncommotion among these beings, who were alike so impetuous and yet so\r\nself-restrained.\r\n\r\nWhen the chief, who had solicited the aid of Duncan, finished his pipe, he made\r\na final and successful movement toward departing. A motion of a finger was the\r\nintimation he gave the supposed physician to follow; and passing through the\r\nclouds of smoke, Duncad was glad, on more accounts than one, to be able at last\r\nto breathe the pure air of a cool and refreshing summer evening.\r\n\r\nInstead of pursuing his way among those lodges where Heyward had already made\r\nhis unsuccessful search, his companion turned aside, and proceeded directly\r\ntoward the base of an adjacent mountain, which overhung the temporary village.\r\nA thicket of brush skirted its foot, and it became necessary to proceed through\r\na crooked and narrow path. The boys had resumed their sports in the clearing,\r\nand were enacting a mimic chase to the post among themselves. In order to\r\nrender their games as like the reality as possible, one of the boldest of their\r\nnumber had conveyed a few brands into some piles of tree-tops that had hitherto\r\nescaped the burning. The blaze of one of these fires lighted the way of the\r\nchief and Duncan, and gave a character of additional wildness to the rude\r\nscenery. At a little distance from a bald rock, and directly in its front, they\r\nentered a grassy opening, which they prepared to cross. Just then fresh fuel\r\nwas added to the fire, and a powerful light penetrated even to that distant\r\nspot. It fell upon the white surface of the mountain, and was reflected\r\ndownward upon a dark and mysterious-looking being that arose, unexpectedly, in\r\ntheir path. The Indian paused, as if doubtful whether to proceed, and permitted\r\nhis companion to approach his side. A large black ball, which at first seemed\r\nstationary, now began to move in a manner that to the latter was inexplicable.\r\nAgain the fire brightened and its glare fell more distinctly on the object.\r\nThen even Duncan knew it, by its restless and sidling attitudes, which kept the\r\nupper part of its form in constant motion, while the animal itself appeared\r\nseated, to be a bear. Though it growled loudly and fiercely, and there were\r\ninstants when its glistening eyeballs might be seen, it gave no other\r\nindications of hostility. The Huron, at least, seemed assured that the\r\nintentions of this singular intruder were peaceable, for after giving it an\r\nattentive examination, he quietly pursued his course.\r\n\r\nDuncan, who knew that the animal was often domesticated among the Indians,\r\nfollowed the example of his companion, believing that some favorite of the\r\ntribe had found its way into the thicket, in search of food. They passed it\r\nunmolested. Though obliged to come nearly in contact with the monster, the\r\nHuron, who had at first so warily determined the character of his strange\r\nvisitor, was now content with proceeding without wasting a moment in further\r\nexamination; but Heyward was unable to prevent his eyes from looking backward,\r\nin salutary watchfulness against attacks in the rear. His uneasiness was in no\r\ndegree diminished when he perceived the beast rolling along their path, and\r\nfollowing their footsteps. He would have spoken, but the Indian at that moment\r\nshoved aside a door of bark, and entered a cavern in the bosom of the mountain.\r\n\r\nProfiting by so easy a method of retreat, Duncan stepped after him, and was\r\ngladly closing the slight cover to the opening, when he felt it drawn from his\r\nhand by the beast, whose shaggy form immediately darkened the passage. They\r\nwere now in a straight and long gallery, in a chasm of the rocks, where retreat\r\nwithout encountering the animal was impossible. Making the best of the\r\ncircumstances, the young man pressed forward, keeping as close as possible to\r\nhis conductor. The bear growled frequently at his heels, and once or twice its\r\nenormous paws were laid on his person, as if disposed to prevent his further\r\npassage into the den.\r\n\r\nHow long the nerves of Heyward would have sustained him in this extraordinary\r\nsituation, it might be difficult to decide, for, happily, he soon found relief.\r\nA glimmer of light had constantly been in their front, and they now arrived at\r\nthe place whence it proceeded.\r\n\r\nA large cavity in the rock had been rudely fitted to answer the purposes of\r\nmany apartments. The subdivisions were simple but ingenious, being composed of\r\nstone, sticks, and bark, intermingled. Openings above admitted the light by\r\nday, and at night fires and torches supplied the place of the sun. Hither the\r\nHurons had brought most of their valuables, especially those which more\r\nparticularly pertained to the nation; and hither, as it now appeared, the sick\r\nwoman, who was believed to be the victim of supernatural power, had been\r\ntransported also, under an impression that her tormentor would find more\r\ndifficulty in making his assaults through walls of stone than through the leafy\r\ncoverings of the lodges. The apartment into which Duncan and his guide first\r\nentered, had been exclusively devoted to her accommodation. The latter\r\napproached her bedside, which was surrounded by females, in the center of whom\r\nHeyward was surprised to find his missing friend David.\r\n\r\nA single look was sufficient to apprise the pretended leech that the invalid\r\nwas far beyond his powers of healing. She lay in a sort of paralysis,\r\nindifferent to the objects which crowded before her sight, and happily\r\nunconscious of suffering. Heyward was far from regretting that his mummeries\r\nwere to be performed on one who was much too ill to take an interest in their\r\nfailure or success. The slight qualm of conscience which had been excited by\r\nthe intended deception was instantly appeased, and he began to collect his\r\nthoughts, in order to enact his part with suitable spirit, when he found he was\r\nabout to be anticipated in his skill by an attempt to prove the power of music.\r\n\r\nGamut, who had stood prepared to pour forth his spirit in song when the\r\nvisitors entered, after delaying a moment, drew a strain from his pipe, and\r\ncommenced a hymn that might have worked a miracle, had faith in its efficacy\r\nbeen of much avail. He was allowed to proceed to the close, the Indians\r\nrespecting his imaginary infirmity, and Duncan too glad of the delay to hazard\r\nthe slightest interruption. As the dying cadence of his strains was falling on\r\nthe ears of the latter, he started aside at hearing them repeated behind him,\r\nin a voice half human and half sepulchral. Looking around, he beheld the shaggy\r\nmonster seated on end in a shadow of the cavern, where, while his restless body\r\nswung in the uneasy manner of the animal, it repeated, in a sort of low growl,\r\nsounds, if not words, which bore some slight resemblance to the melody of the\r\nsinger.\r\n\r\nThe effect of so strange an echo on David may better be imagined than\r\ndescribed. His eyes opened as if he doubted their truth; and his voice became\r\ninstantly mute in excess of wonder. A deep-laid scheme, of communicating some\r\nimportant intelligence to Heyward, was driven from his recollection by an\r\nemotion which very nearly resembled fear, but which he was fain to believe was\r\nadmiration. Under its influence, he exclaimed aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cShe expects you,\r\nand is at hand\xe2\x80\x9d; and precipitately left the cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnug.\xe2\x80\x94Have you the lion\xe2\x80\x99s part written? Pray you, if it be,\r\ngive it to me, for I am slow of study.\r\n\r\nQuince.\xe2\x80\x94You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but\r\nroaring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a strange blending of the ridiculous with that which was solemn in\r\nthis scene. The beast still continued its rolling, and apparently untiring\r\nmovements, though its ludicrous attempt to imitate the melody of David ceased\r\nthe instant the latter abandoned the field. The words of Gamut were, as has\r\nbeen seen, in his native tongue; and to Duncan they seem pregnant with some\r\nhidden meaning, though nothing present assisted him in discovering the object\r\nof their allusion. A speedy end was, however, put to every conjecture on the\r\nsubject, by the manner of the chief, who advanced to the bedside of the\r\ninvalid, and beckoned away the whole group of female attendants that had\r\nclustered there to witness the skill of the stranger. He was implicitly, though\r\nreluctantly, obeyed; and when the low echo which rang along the hollow, natural\r\ngallery, from the distant closing door, had ceased, pointing toward his\r\ninsensible daughter, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let my brother show his power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus unequivocally called on to exercise the functions of his assumed\r\ncharacter, Heyward was apprehensive that the smallest delay might prove\r\ndangerous. Endeavoring, then, to collect his ideas, he prepared to perform that\r\nspecies of incantation, and those uncouth rites, under which the Indian\r\nconjurers are accustomed to conceal their ignorance and impotency. It is more\r\nthan probable that, in the disordered state of his thoughts, he would soon have\r\nfallen into some suspicious, if not fatal, error had not his incipient attempts\r\nbeen interrupted by a fierce growl from the quadruped. Three several times did\r\nhe renew his efforts to proceed, and as often was he met by the same\r\nunaccountable opposition, each interruption seeming more savage and threatening\r\nthan the preceding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cunning ones are jealous,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Huron; \xe2\x80\x9cI go.\r\nBrother, the woman is the wife of one of my bravest young men; deal justly by\r\nher. Peace!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, beckoning to the discontented beast to be quiet;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chief was as good as his word, and Duncan now found himself alone in that\r\nwild and desolate abode with the helpless invalid and the fierce and dangerous\r\nbrute. The latter listened to the movements of the Indian with that air of\r\nsagacity that a bear is known to possess, until another echo announced that he\r\nhad also left the cavern, when it turned and came waddling up to Duncan before\r\nwhom it seated itself in its natural attitude, erect like a man. The youth\r\nlooked anxiously about him for some weapon, with which he might make a\r\nresistance against the attack he now seriously expected.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, however, as if the humor of the animal had suddenly changed. Instead\r\nof continuing its discontented growls, or manifesting any further signs of\r\nanger, the whole of its shaggy body shook violently, as if agitated by some\r\nstrange internal convulsion. The huge and unwieldy talons pawed stupidly about\r\nthe grinning muzzle, and while Heyward kept his eyes riveted on its movements\r\nwith jealous watchfulness, the grim head fell on one side and in its place\r\nappeared the honest sturdy countenance of the scout, who was indulging from the\r\nbottom of his soul in his own peculiar expression of merriment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHist!\xe2\x80\x9d said the wary woodsman, interrupting Heyward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexclamation of surprise; \xe2\x80\x9cthe varlets are about the place, and any sounds\r\nthat are not natural to witchcraft would bring them back upon us in a\r\nbody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the meaning of this masquerade; and why you have attempted so\r\ndesperate an adventure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, reason and calculation are often outdone by accident,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, as a story should always commence at the\r\nbeginning, I will tell you the whole in order. After we parted I placed the\r\ncommandant and the Sagamore in an old beaver lodge, where they are safer from\r\nthe Hurons than they would be in the garrison of Edward; for your high\r\nnorth-west Indians, not having as yet got the traders among them, continued to\r\nvenerate the beaver. After which Uncas and I pushed for the other encampment as\r\nwas agreed. Have you seen the lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my great grief! He is captive, and condemned to die at the rising of\r\nthe sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had misgivings that such would be his fate,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the scout,\r\nin a less confident and joyous tone. But soon regaining his naturally firm\r\nvoice, he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHis bad fortune is the true reason of my being\r\nhere, for it would never do to abandon such a boy to the Hurons. A rare time\r\nthe knaves would have of it, could they tie \xe2\x80\x98The Bounding Elk\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Long Carabine\xe2\x80\x99, as they call me, to the same stake! Though why\r\nthey have given me such a name I never knew, there being as little likeness\r\nbetween the gifts of \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 and the performance of one of your\r\nreal Canada carabynes, as there is between the natur\xe2\x80\x99 of a pipe-stone and\r\na flint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep to your tale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the impatient Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cwe know not\r\nat what moment the Hurons may return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear of them. A conjurer must have his time, like a straggling priest\r\nin the settlements. We are as safe from interruption as a missionary would be\r\nat the beginning of a two hours\xe2\x80\x99 discourse. Well, Uncas and I fell in\r\nwith a return party of the varlets; the lad was much too forward for a scout;\r\nnay, for that matter, being of hot blood, he was not so much to blame; and,\r\nafter all, one of the Hurons proved a coward, and in fleeing led him into an\r\nambushment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd dearly has he paid for the weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout significantly passed his hand across his own throat, and nodded, as\r\nif he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI comprehend your meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d After which he continued,\r\nin a more audible though scarcely more intelligible language:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the loss of the boy I turned upon the Hurons, as you may judge.\r\nThere have been scrimmages atween one or two of their outlyers and myself; but\r\nthat is neither here nor there. So, after I had shot the imps, I got in pretty\r\nnigh to the lodges without further commotion. Then what should luck do in my\r\nfavor but lead me to the very spot where one of the most famous conjurers of\r\nthe tribe was dressing himself, as I well knew, for some great battle with\r\nSatan\xe2\x80\x94though why should I call that luck, which it now seems was an\r\nespecial ordering of Providence. So a judgmatical rap over the head stiffened\r\nthe lying impostor for a time, and leaving him a bit of walnut for his supper,\r\nto prevent an uproar, and stringing him up atween two saplings, I made free\r\nwith his finery, and took the part of the bear on myself, in order that the\r\noperations might proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd admirably did you enact the character; the animal itself might have\r\nbeen shamed by the representation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, major,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the flattered woodsman, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be\r\nbut a poor scholar for one who has studied so long in the wilderness, did I not\r\nknow how to set forth the movements or natur\xe2\x80\x99 of such a beast. Had it\r\nbeen now a catamount, or even a full-size panther, I would have embellished a\r\nperformance for you worth regarding. But it is no such marvelous feat to\r\nexhibit the feats of so dull a beast; though, for that matter, too, a bear may\r\nbe overacted. Yes, yes; it is not every imitator that knows natur\xe2\x80\x99 may be\r\noutdone easier than she is equaled. But all our work is yet before us. Where is\r\nthe gentle one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows. I have examined every lodge in the village, without\r\ndiscovering the slightest trace of her presence in the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard what the singer said, as he left us: \xe2\x80\x98She is at hand,\r\nand expects you\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been compelled to believe he alluded to this unhappy\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe simpleton was frightened, and blundered through his message; but he\r\nhad a deeper meaning. Here are walls enough to separate the whole settlement. A\r\nbear ought to climb; therefore will I take a look above them. There may be\r\nhoney-pots hid in these rocks, and I am a beast, you know, that has a hankering\r\nfor the sweets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout looked behind him, laughing at his own conceit, while he clambered up\r\nthe partition, imitating, as he went, the clumsy motions of the beast he\r\nrepresented; but the instant the summit was gained he made a gesture for\r\nsilence, and slid down with the utmost precipitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is here,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cand by that door you will find\r\nher. I would have spoken a word of comfort to the afflicted soul; but the sight\r\nof such a monster might upset her reason. Though for that matter, major, you\r\nare none of the most inviting yourself in your paint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, who had already swung eagerly forward, drew instantly back on hearing\r\nthese discouraging words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I, then, so very revolting?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, with an air of\r\nchagrin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might not startle a wolf, or turn the Royal Americans from a\r\ndischarge; but I have seen the time when you had a better favored look; your\r\nstreaked countenances are not ill-judged of by the squaws, but young women of\r\nwhite blood give the preference to their own color. See,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\npointing to a place where the water trickled from a rock, forming a little\r\ncrystal spring, before it found an issue through the adjacent crevices;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou may easily get rid of the Sagamore\xe2\x80\x99s daub, and when you come\r\nback I will try my hand at a new embellishment. It\xe2\x80\x99s as common for a\r\nconjurer to alter his paint as for a buck in the settlements to change his\r\nfinery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe deliberate woodsman had little occasion to hunt for arguments to enforce\r\nhis advice. He was yet speaking when Duncan availed himself of the water. In a\r\nmoment every frightful or offensive mark was obliterated, and the youth\r\nappeared again in the lineaments with which he had been gifted by nature. Thus\r\nprepared for an interview with his mistress, he took a hasty leave of his\r\ncompanion, and disappeared through the indicated passage. The scout witnessed\r\nhis departure with complacency, nodding his head after him, and muttering his\r\ngood wishes; after which he very coolly set about an examination of the state\r\nof the larder, among the Hurons, the cavern, among other purposes, being used\r\nas a receptacle for the fruits of their hunts.\r\n\r\nDuncan had no other guide than a distant glimmering light, which served,\r\nhowever, the office of a polar star to the lover. By its aid he was enabled to\r\nenter the haven of his hopes, which was merely another apartment of the cavern,\r\nthat had been solely appropriated to the safekeeping of so important a prisoner\r\nas a daughter of the commandant of William Henry. It was profusely strewed with\r\nthe plunder of that unlucky fortress. In the midst of this confusion he found\r\nher he sought, pale, anxious and terrified, but lovely. David had prepared her\r\nfor such a visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuncan!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in a voice that seemed to tremble at the\r\nsounds created by itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, leaping carelessly among trunks, boxes, arms,\r\nand furniture, until he stood at her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that you would never desert me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking up with\r\na momentary glow on her otherwise dejected countenance. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are\r\nalone! Grateful as it is to be thus remembered, I could wish to think you are\r\nnot entirely alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, observing that she trembled in a manner which betrayed her inability to\r\nstand, gently induced her to be seated, while he recounted those leading\r\nincidents which it has been our task to accord. Alice listened with breathless\r\ninterest; and though the young man touched lightly on the sorrows of the\r\nstricken father; taking care, however, not to wound the self-love of his\r\nauditor, the tears ran as freely down the cheeks of the daughter as though she\r\nhad never wept before. The soothing tenderness of Duncan, however, soon quieted\r\nthe first burst of her emotions, and she then heard him to the close with\r\nundivided attention, if not with composure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Alice,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will see how much is still\r\nexpected of you. By the assistance of our experienced and invaluable friend,\r\nthe scout, we may find our way from this savage people, but you will have to\r\nexert your utmost fortitude. Remember that you fly to the arms of your\r\nvenerable parent, and how much his happiness, as well as your own, depends on\r\nthose exertions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I do otherwise for a father who has done so much for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for me, too,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the youth, gently pressing the hand he\r\nheld in both his own.\r\n\r\nThe look of innocence and surprise which he received in return convinced Duncan\r\nof the necessity of being more explicit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is neither the place nor the occasion to detain you with selfish\r\nwishes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what heart loaded like mine would not wish\r\nto cast its burden? They say misery is the closest of all ties; our common\r\nsuffering in your behalf left but little to be explained between your father\r\nand myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, dearest Cora, Duncan; surely Cora was not forgotten?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot forgotten! no; regretted, as woman was seldom mourned before. Your\r\nvenerable father knew no difference between his children; but I\xe2\x80\x94Alice,\r\nyou will not be offended when I say, that to me her worth was in a degree\r\nobscured\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you knew not the merit of my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, withdrawing\r\nher hand; \xe2\x80\x9cof you she ever speaks as of one who is her dearest\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would gladly believe her such,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Duncan, hastily;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could wish her to be even more; but with you, Alice, I have the\r\npermission of your father to aspire to a still nearer and dearer tie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlice trembled violently, and there was an instant during which she bent her\r\nface aside, yielding to the emotions common to her sex; but they quickly passed\r\naway, leaving her mistress of her deportment, if not of her affections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyward,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking him full in the face with a touching\r\nexpression of innocence and dependency, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me the sacred presence and\r\nthe holy sanction of that parent before you urge me further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough more I should not, less I could not say,\xe2\x80\x9d the youth was\r\nabout to answer, when he was interrupted by a light tap on his shoulder.\r\nStarting to his feet, he turned, and, confronting the intruder, his looks fell\r\non the dark form and malignant visage of Magua. The deep guttural laugh of the\r\nsavage sounded, at such a moment, to Duncan, like the hellish taunt of a demon.\r\nHad he pursued the sudden and fierce impulse of the instant, he would have cast\r\nhimself on the Huron, and committed their fortunes to the issue of a deadly\r\nstruggle. But, without arms of any description, ignorant of what succor his\r\nsubtle enemy could command, and charged with the safety of one who was just\r\nthen dearer than ever to his heart, he no sooner entertained than he abandoned\r\nthe desperate intention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, meekly folding her arms on her\r\nbosom, and struggling to conceal an agony of apprehension in behalf of Heyward,\r\nin the usual cold and distant manner with which she received the visits of her\r\ncaptor.\r\n\r\nThe exulting Indian had resumed his austere countenance, though he drew warily\r\nback before the menacing glance of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s fiery eye. He regarded\r\nboth his captives for a moment with a steady look, and then, stepping aside, he\r\ndropped a log of wood across a door different from that by which Duncan had\r\nentered. The latter now comprehended the manner of his surprise, and, believing\r\nhimself irretrievably lost, he drew Alice to his bosom, and stood prepared to\r\nmeet a fate which he hardly regretted, since it was to be suffered in such\r\ncompany. But Magua meditated no immediate violence. His first measures were\r\nvery evidently taken to secure his new captive; nor did he even bestow a second\r\nglance at the motionless forms in the center of the cavern, until he had\r\ncompletely cut off every hope of retreat through the private outlet he had\r\nhimself used. He was watched in all his movements by Heyward, who, however,\r\nremained firm, still folding the fragile form of Alice to his heart, at once\r\ntoo proud and too hopeless to ask favor of an enemy so often foiled. When Magua\r\nhad effected his object he approached his prisoners, and said in English:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pale faces trap the cunning beavers; but the red-skins know how to\r\ntake the Yengeese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuron, do your worst!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the excited Heyward, forgetful\r\nthat a double stake was involved in his life; \xe2\x80\x9cyou and your vengeance are\r\nalike despised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill the white man speak these words at the stake?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magua;\r\nmanifesting, at the same time, how little faith he had in the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution by the sneer that accompanied his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere; singly to your face, or in the presence of your nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Renard Subtil is a great chief!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Indian; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nwill go and bring his young men, to see how bravely a pale face can laugh at\r\ntortures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away while speaking, and was about to leave the place through the\r\navenue by which Duncan had approached, when a growl caught his ear, and caused\r\nhim to hesitate. The figure of the bear appeared in the door, where it sat,\r\nrolling from side to side in its customary restlessness. Magua, like the father\r\nof the sick woman, eyed it keenly for a moment, as if to ascertain its\r\ncharacter. He was far above the more vulgar superstitions of his tribe, and so\r\nsoon as he recognized the well-known attire of the conjurer, he prepared to\r\npass it in cool contempt. But a louder and more threatening growl caused him\r\nagain to pause. Then he seemed as if suddenly resolved to trifle no longer, and\r\nmoved resolutely forward.\r\n\r\nThe mimic animal, which had advanced a little, retired slowly in his front,\r\nuntil it arrived again at the pass, when, rearing on his hinder legs, it beat\r\nthe air with its paws, in the manner practised by its brutal prototype.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the chief, in Huron, \xe2\x80\x9cgo play with the\r\nchildren and squaws; leave men to their wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe once more endeavored to pass the supposed empiric, scorning even the parade\r\nof threatening to use the knife, or tomahawk, that was pendent from his belt.\r\nSuddenly the beast extended its arms, or rather legs, and inclosed him in a\r\ngrasp that might have vied with the far-famed power of the \xe2\x80\x9cbear\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhug\xe2\x80\x9d itself. Heyward had watched the whole procedure, on the part of\r\nHawkeye, with breathless interest. At first he relinquished his hold of Alice;\r\nthen he caught up a thong of buckskin, which had been used around some bundle,\r\nand when he beheld his enemy with his two arms pinned to his side by the iron\r\nmuscles of the scout, he rushed upon him, and effectually secured them there.\r\nArms, legs, and feet were encircled in twenty folds of the thong, in less time\r\nthan we have taken to record the circumstance. When the formidable Huron was\r\ncompletely pinioned, the scout released his hold, and Duncan laid his enemy on\r\nhis back, utterly helpless.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of this sudden and extraordinary operation, Magua, though\r\nhe had struggled violently, until assured he was in the hands of one whose\r\nnerves were far better strung than his own, had not uttered the slightest\r\nexclamation. But when Hawkeye, by way of making a summary explanation of his\r\nconduct, removed the shaggy jaws of the beast, and exposed his own rugged and\r\nearnest countenance to the gaze of the Huron, the philosophy of the latter was\r\nso far mastered as to permit him to utter the never failing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve found your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said his undisturbed\r\nconqueror; \xe2\x80\x9cnow, in order that you shall not use it to our ruin, I must\r\nmake free to stop your mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs there was no time to be lost, the scout immediately set about effecting so\r\nnecessary a precaution; and when he had gagged the Indian, his enemy might\r\nsafely have been considered as \xe2\x80\x9chors de combat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what place did the imp enter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the industrious scout,\r\nwhen his work was ended. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a soul has passed my way since you left\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan pointed out the door by which Magua had come, and which now presented\r\ntoo many obstacles to a quick retreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring on the gentle one, then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his friend; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nmust make a push for the woods by the other outlet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cfear has overcome her,\r\nand she is helpless. Alice! my sweet, my own Alice, arouse yourself; now is the\r\nmoment to fly. \xe2\x80\x99Tis in vain! she hears, but is unable to follow. Go,\r\nnoble and worthy friend; save yourself, and leave me to my fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery trail has its end, and every calamity brings its lesson!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, wrap her in them Indian cloths. Conceal all\r\nof her little form. Nay, that foot has no fellow in the wilderness; it will\r\nbetray her. All, every part. Now take her in your arms, and follow. Leave the\r\nrest to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, as may be gathered from the words of his companion, was eagerly\r\nobeying; and, as the other finished speaking, he took the light person of Alice\r\nin his arms, and followed in the footsteps of the scout. They found the sick\r\nwoman as they had left her, still alone, and passed swiftly on, by the natural\r\ngallery, to the place of entrance. As they approached the little door of bark,\r\na murmur of voices without announced that the friends and relatives of the\r\ninvalid were gathered about the place, patiently awaiting a summons to\r\nre-enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I open my lips to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d Hawkeye whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cmy English,\r\nwhich is the genuine tongue of a white-skin, will tell the varlets that an\r\nenemy is among them. You must give \xe2\x80\x99em your jargon, major; and say that\r\nwe have shut the evil spirit in the cave, and are taking the woman to the woods\r\nin order to find strengthening roots. Practise all your cunning, for it is a\r\nlawful undertaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened a little, as if one without was listening to the proceedings\r\nwithin, and compelled the scout to cease his directions. A fierce growl\r\nrepelled the eavesdropper, and then the scout boldly threw open the covering of\r\nbark, and left the place, enacting the character of a bear as he proceeded.\r\nDuncan kept close at his heels, and soon found himself in the center of a\r\ncluster of twenty anxious relatives and friends.\r\n\r\nThe crowd fell back a little, and permitted the father, and one who appeared to\r\nbe the husband of the woman, to approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas my brother driven away the evil spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the former.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he in his arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy child,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Duncan, gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cthe disease has gone\r\nout of her; it is shut up in the rocks. I take the woman to a distance, where I\r\nwill strengthen her against any further attacks. She will be in the wigwam of\r\nthe young man when the sun comes again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the father had translated the meaning of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s words into\r\nthe Huron language, a suppressed murmur announced the satisfaction with which\r\nthis intelligence was received. The chief himself waved his hand for Duncan to\r\nproceed, saying aloud, in a firm voice, and with a lofty manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo; I am a man, and I will enter the rock and fight the wicked\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward had gladly obeyed, and was already past the little group, when these\r\nstartling words arrested him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my brother mad?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cis he cruel? He will meet\r\nthe disease, and it will enter him; or he will drive out the disease, and it\r\nwill chase his daughter into the woods. No; let my children wait without, and\r\nif the spirit appears beat him down with clubs. He is cunning, and will bury\r\nhimself in the mountain, when he sees how many are ready to fight him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis singular warning had the desired effect. Instead of entering the cavern,\r\nthe father and husband drew their tomahawks, and posted themselves in readiness\r\nto deal their vengeance on the imaginary tormentor of their sick relative,\r\nwhile the women and children broke branches from the bushes, or seized\r\nfragments of the rock, with a similar intention. At this favorable moment the\r\ncounterfeit conjurers disappeared.\r\n\r\nHawkeye, at the same time that he had presumed so far on the nature of the\r\nIndian superstitions, was not ignorant that they were rather tolerated than\r\nrelied on by the wisest of the chiefs. He well knew the value of time in the\r\npresent emergency. Whatever might be the extent of the self-delusion of his\r\nenemies, and however it had tended to assist his schemes, the slightest cause\r\nof suspicion, acting on the subtle nature of an Indian, would be likely to\r\nprove fatal. Taking the path, therefore, that was most likely to avoid\r\nobservation, he rather skirted than entered the village. The warriors were\r\nstill to be seen in the distance, by the fading light of the fires, stalking\r\nfrom lodge to lodge. But the children had abandoned their sports for their beds\r\nof skins, and the quiet of night was already beginning to prevail over the\r\nturbulence and excitement of so busy and important an evening.\r\n\r\nAlice revived under the renovating influence of the open air, and, as her\r\nphysical rather than her mental powers had been the subject of weakness, she\r\nstood in no need of any explanation of that which had occurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let me make an effort to walk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when they had\r\nentered the forest, blushing, though unseen, that she had not been sooner able\r\nto quit the arms of Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cI am indeed restored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Alice, you are yet too weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maiden struggled gently to release herself, and Heyward was compelled to\r\npart with his precious burden. The representative of the bear had certainly\r\nbeen an entire stranger to the delicious emotions of the lover while his arms\r\nencircled his mistress; and he was, perhaps, a stranger also to the nature of\r\nthat feeling of ingenuous shame that oppressed the trembling Alice. But when he\r\nfound himself at a suitable distance from the lodges he made a halt, and spoke\r\non a subject of which he was thoroughly the master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis path will lead you to the brook,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cfollow its\r\nnorthern bank until you come to a fall; mount the hill on your right, and you\r\nwill see the fires of the other people. There you must go and demand\r\nprotection; if they are true Delawares you will be safe. A distant flight with\r\nthat gentle one, just now, is impossible. The Hurons would follow up our trail,\r\nand master our scalps before we had got a dozen miles. Go, and Providence be\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you!\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Heyward, in surprise; \xe2\x80\x9csurely we part not\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hurons hold the pride of the Delawares; the last of the high blood\r\nof the Mohicans is in their power,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cI go to\r\nsee what can be done in his favor. Had they mastered your scalp, major, a knave\r\nshould have fallen for every hair it held, as I promised; but if the young\r\nSagamore is to be led to the stake, the Indians shall see also how a man\r\nwithout a cross can die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot in the least offended with the decided preference that the sturdy woodsman\r\ngave to one who might, in some degree, be called the child of his adoption,\r\nDuncan still continued to urge such reasons against so desperate an effort as\r\npresented themselves. He was aided by Alice, who mingled her entreaties with\r\nthose of Heyward that he would abandon a resolution that promised so much\r\ndanger, with so little hope of success. Their eloquence and ingenuity were\r\nexpended in vain. The scout heard them attentively, but impatiently, and\r\nfinally closed the discussion, by answering, in a tone that instantly silenced\r\nAlice, while it told Heyward how fruitless any further remonstrances would be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is a feeling in youth\r\nwhich binds man to woman closer than the father is tied to the son. It may be\r\nso. I have seldom been where women of my color dwell; but such may be the gifts\r\nof nature in the settlements. You have risked life, and all that is dear to\r\nyou, to bring off this gentle one, and I suppose that some such disposition is\r\nat the bottom of it all. As for me, I taught the lad the real character of a\r\nrifle; and well has he paid me for it. I have fou\xe2\x80\x99t at his side in many a\r\nbloody scrimmage; and so long as I could hear the crack of his piece in one\r\near, and that of the Sagamore in the other, I knew no enemy was on my back.\r\nWinters and summer, nights and days, have we roved the wilderness in company,\r\neating of the same dish, one sleeping while the other watched; and afore it\r\nshall be said that Uncas was taken to the torment, and I at hand\xe2\x80\x94There is\r\nbut a single Ruler of us all, whatever may the color of the skin; and Him I\r\ncall to witness, that before the Mohican boy shall perish for the want of a\r\nfriend, good faith shall depart the \xe2\x80\x99arth, and \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbecome as harmless as the tooting we\xe2\x80\x99pon of the singer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan released his hold on the arm of the scout, who turned, and steadily\r\nretraced his steps toward the lodges. After pausing a moment to gaze at his\r\nretiring form, the successful and yet sorrowful Heyward and Alice took their\r\nway together toward the distant village of the Delawares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBot.\xe2\x80\x94Let me play the lion too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the high resolution of Hawkeye he fully comprehended all the\r\ndifficulties and danger he was about to incur. In his return to the camp, his\r\nacute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to\r\ncounteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies, that he\r\nknew were, in no degree, inferior to his own. Nothing but the color of his skin\r\nhad saved the lives of Magua and the conjurer, who would have been the first\r\nvictims sacrificed to his own security, had not the scout believed such an act,\r\nhowever congenial it might be to the nature of an Indian, utterly unworthy of\r\none who boasted a descent from men that knew no cross of blood. Accordingly, he\r\ntrusted to the withes and ligaments with which he had bound his captives, and\r\npursued his way directly toward the center of the lodges. As he approached the\r\nbuildings, his steps become more deliberate, and his vigilant eye suffered no\r\nsign, whether friendly or hostile, to escape him. A neglected hut was a little\r\nin advance of the others, and appeared as if it had been deserted when half\r\ncompleted\xe2\x80\x94most probably on account of failing in some of the more\r\nimportant requisites; such as wood or water. A faint light glimmered through\r\nits cracks, however, and announced that, notwithstanding its imperfect\r\nstructure, it was not without a tenant. Thither, then, the scout proceeded,\r\nlike a prudent general, who was about to feel the advanced positions of his\r\nenemy, before he hazarded the main attack.\r\n\r\nThrowing himself into a suitable posture for the beast he represented, Hawkeye\r\ncrawled to a little opening, where he might command a view of the interior. It\r\nproved to be the abiding place of David Gamut. Hither the faithful\r\nsinging-master had now brought himself, together with all his sorrows, his\r\napprehensions, and his meek dependence on the protection of Providence. At the\r\nprecise moment when his ungainly person came under the observation of the\r\nscout, in the manner just mentioned, the woodsman himself, though in his\r\nassumed character, was the subject of the solitary being\xe2\x80\x99s profounded\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nHowever implicit the faith of David was in the performance of ancient miracles,\r\nhe eschewed the belief of any direct supernatural agency in the management of\r\nmodern morality. In other words, while he had implicit faith in the ability of\r\nBalaam\xe2\x80\x99s ass to speak, he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a\r\nbear\xe2\x80\x99s singing; and yet he had been assured of the latter, on the\r\ntestimony of his own exquisite organs. There was something in his air and\r\nmanner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind.\r\nHe was seated on a pile of brush, a few twigs from which occasionally fed his\r\nlow fire, with his head leaning on his arm, in a posture of melancholy musing.\r\nThe costume of the votary of music had undergone no other alteration from that\r\nso lately described, except that he had covered his bald head with the\r\ntriangular beaver, which had not proved sufficiently alluring to excite the\r\ncupidity of any of his captors.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious Hawkeye, who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had\r\nabandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman, was not without his\r\nsuspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation. First making\r\nthe circuit of the hut, and ascertaining that it stood quite alone, and that\r\nthe character of its inmate was likely to protect it from visitors, he ventured\r\nthrough its low door, into the very presence of Gamut. The position of the\r\nlatter brought the fire between them; and when Hawkeye had seated himself on\r\nend, near a minute elapsed, during which the two remained regarding each other\r\nwithout speaking. The suddenness and the nature of the surprise had nearly\r\nproved too much for\xe2\x80\x94we will not say the philosophy\xe2\x80\x94but for the\r\npitch and resolution of David. He fumbled for his pitch-pipe, and arose with a\r\nconfused intention of attempting a musical exorcism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark and mysterious monster!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, while with trembling\r\nhands he disposed of his auxiliary eyes, and sought his never-failing resource\r\nin trouble, the gifted version of the psalms; \xe2\x80\x9cI know not your nature nor\r\nintents; but if aught you meditate against the person and rights of one of the\r\nhumblest servants of the temple, listen to the inspired language of the youth\r\nof Israel, and repent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well-known voice replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut up the tooting we\xe2\x80\x99pon, and teach your throat modesty. Five\r\nwords of plain and comprehendible English are worth just now an hour of\r\nsqualling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded David, utterly disqualified to pursue his\r\noriginal intention, and nearly gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man like yourself; and one whose blood is as little tainted by the\r\ncross of a bear, or an Indian, as your own. Have you so soon forgotten from\r\nwhom you received the foolish instrument you hold in your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan these things be?\xe2\x80\x9d returned David, breathing more freely, as\r\nthe truth began to dawn upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cI have found many marvels during my\r\nsojourn with the heathen, but surely nothing to excel this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hawkeye, uncasing his honest countenance,\r\nthe better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may\r\nsee a skin, which, if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones, has no\r\ntinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed.\r\nNow let us to business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst tell me of the maiden, and of the youth who so bravely sought\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted David.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, they are happily freed from the tomahawks of these varlets. But can\r\nyou put me on the scent of Uncas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young man is in bondage, and much I fear his death is decreed. I\r\ngreatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance, and I have\r\nsought a goodly hymn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you lead me to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe task will not be difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d returned David, hesitating;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough I greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate\r\nhis unhappy fortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more words, but lead on,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hawkeye, concealing his face\r\nagain, and setting the example in his own person, by instantly quitting the\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded, the scout ascertained that his companion found access to\r\nUncas, under privilege of his imaginary infirmity, aided by the favor he had\r\nacquired with one of the guards, who, in consequence of speaking a little\r\nEnglish, had been selected by David as the subject of a religious conversion.\r\nHow far the Huron comprehended the intentions of his new friend may well be\r\ndoubted; but as exclusive attention is as flattering to a savage as to a more\r\ncivilized individual, it had produced the effect we have mentioned. It is\r\nunnecessary to repeat the shrewd manner with which the scout extracted these\r\nparticulars from the simple David; neither shall we dwell in this place on the\r\nnature of the instruction he delivered, when completely master of all the\r\nnecessary facts; as the whole will be sufficiently explained to the reader in\r\nthe course of the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe lodge in which Uncas was confined was in the very center of the village,\r\nand in a situation, perhaps, more difficult than any other to approach, or\r\nleave, without observation. But it was not the policy of Hawkeye to affect the\r\nleast concealment. Presuming on his disguise, and his ability to sustain the\r\ncharacter he had assumed, he took the most plain and direct route to the place.\r\nThe hour, however, afforded him some little of that protection which he\r\nappeared so much to despise. The boys were already buried in sleep, and all the\r\nwomen, and most of the warriors, had retired to their lodges for the night.\r\nFour or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of Uncas,\r\nwary but close observers of the manner of their captive.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of Gamut, accompanied by one in the well-known masquerade of their\r\nmost distinguished conjurer, they readily made way for them both. Still they\r\nbetrayed no intention to depart. On the other hand, they were evidently\r\ndisposed to remain bound to the place by an additional interest in the\r\nmysterious mummeries that they of course expected from such a visit.\r\n\r\nFrom the total inability of the scout to address the Hurons in their own\r\nlanguage, he was compelled to trust the conversation entirely to David.\r\nNotwithstanding the simplicity of the latter, he did ample justice to the\r\ninstructions he had received, more than fulfilling the strongest hopes of his\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Delawares are women!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, addressing himself to the\r\nsavage who had a slight understanding of the language in which he spoke;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Yengeese, my foolish countrymen, have told them to take up the\r\ntomahawk, and strike their fathers in the Canadas, and they have forgotten\r\ntheir sex. Does my brother wish to hear \xe2\x80\x98Le Cerf Agile\xe2\x80\x99 ask for his\r\npetticoats, and see him weep before the Hurons, at the stake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exclamation \xe2\x80\x9cHugh!\xe2\x80\x9d delivered in a strong tone of assent,\r\nannounced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an\r\nexhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let him step aside, and the cunning man will blow upon the dog.\r\nTell it to my brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Huron explained the meaning of David to his fellows, who, in their turn,\r\nlistened to the project with that sort of satisfaction that their untamed\r\nspirits might be expected to find in such a refinement in cruelty. They drew\r\nback a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter.\r\nBut the bear, instead of obeying, maintained the seat it had taken, and\r\ngrowled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers,\r\nand take away their courage too,\xe2\x80\x9d continued David, improving the hint he\r\nreceived; \xe2\x80\x9cthey must stand further off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Hurons, who would have deemed such a misfortune the heaviest calamity that\r\ncould befall them, fell back in a body, taking a position where they were out\r\nof earshot, though at the same time they could command a view of the entrance\r\nto the lodge. Then, as if satisfied of their safety, the scout left his\r\nposition, and slowly entered the place. It was silent and gloomy, being\r\ntenanted solely by the captive, and lighted by the dying embers of a fire,\r\nwhich had been used for the purposed of cookery.\r\n\r\nUncas occupied a distant corner, in a reclining attitude, being rigidly bound,\r\nboth hands and feet, by strong and painful withes. When the frightful object\r\nfirst presented itself to the young Mohican, he did not deign to bestow a\r\nsingle glance on the animal. The scout, who had left David at the door, to\r\nascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise\r\nuntil assured of their privacy. Instead of speaking, therefore, he exerted\r\nhimself to enact one of the antics of the animal he represented. The young\r\nMohican, who at first believed his enemies had sent in a real beast to torment\r\nhim, and try his nerves, detected in those performances that to Heyward had\r\nappeared so accurate, certain blemishes, that at once betrayed the counterfeit.\r\nHad Hawkeye been aware of the low estimation in which the skillful Uncas held\r\nhis representations, he would probably have prolonged the entertainment a\r\nlittle in pique. But the scornful expression of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\nadmitted of so many constructions, that the worthy scout was spared the\r\nmortification of such a discovery. As soon, therefore, as David gave the\r\npreconcerted signal, a low hissing sound was heard in the lodge in place of the\r\nfierce growlings of the bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nHis keen eye rested on the shaggy monster.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncas had cast his body back against the wall of the hut and closed his eyes,\r\nas if willing to exclude so contemptible and disagreeable an object from his\r\nsight. But the moment the noise of the serpent was heard, he arose, and cast\r\nhis looks on each side of him, bending his head low, and turning it inquiringly\r\nin every direction, until his keen eye rested on the shaggy monster, where it\r\nremained riveted, as though fixed by the power of a charm. Again the same\r\nsounds were repeated, evidently proceeding from the mouth of the beast. Once\r\nmore the eyes of the youth roamed over the interior of the lodge, and returning\r\nto the former resting place, he uttered, in a deep, suppressed voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHawkeye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut his bands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye to David, who just then approached\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe singer did as he was ordered, and Uncas found his limbs released. At the\r\nsame moment the dried skin of the animal rattled, and presently the scout arose\r\nto his feet, in proper person. The Mohican appeared to comprehend the nature of\r\nthe attempt his friend had made, intuitively, neither tongue nor feature\r\nbetraying another symptom of surprise. When Hawkeye had cast his shaggy\r\nvestment, which was done by simply loosing certain thongs of skin, he drew a\r\nlong, glittering knife, and put it in the hands of Uncas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe red Hurons are without,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9clet us be\r\nready.\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time he laid his finger significantly on another\r\nsimilar weapon, both being the fruits of his prowess among their enemies during\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Tortoises; they are the children of my grandfathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout in English\xe2\x80\x94a language he was apt to\r\nuse when a little abstracted in mind; \xe2\x80\x9cthe same blood runs in your veins,\r\nI believe; but time and distance has a little changed its color. What shall we\r\ndo with the Mingoes at the door? They count six, and this singer is as good as\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hurons are boasters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncas, scornfully; \xe2\x80\x9ctheir\r\n\xe2\x80\x98totem\xe2\x80\x99 is a moose, and they run like snails. The Delawares are\r\nchildren of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, lad, there is truth in what you say; and I doubt not, on a rush, you\r\nwould pass the whole nation; and, in a straight race of two miles, would be in,\r\nand get your breath again, afore a knave of them all was within hearing of the\r\nother village. But the gift of a white man lies more in his arms than in his\r\nlegs. As for myself, I can brain a Huron as well as a better man; but when it\r\ncomes to a race the knaves would prove too much for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas, who had already approached the door, in readiness to lead the way, now\r\nrecoiled, and placed himself, once more, in the bottom of the lodge. But\r\nHawkeye, who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement,\r\ncontinued speaking more to himself than to his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is unreasonable to keep one man in\r\nbondage to the gifts of another. So, Uncas, you had better take the lead, while\r\nI will put on the skin again, and trust to cunning for want of speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Mohican made no reply, but quietly folded his arms, and leaned his\r\nbody against one of the upright posts that supported the wall of the hut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout looking up at him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you tarry?\r\nThere will be time enough for me, as the knaves will give chase to you at\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncas will stay,\xe2\x80\x9d was the calm reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo fight with his father\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and die with the friend of the\r\nDelawares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hawkeye, squeezing the hand of Uncas between\r\nhis own iron fingers; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99twould have been more like a Mingo than a\r\nMohican had you left me. But I thought I would make the offer, seeing that\r\nyouth commonly loves life. Well, what can\xe2\x80\x99t be done by main courage, in\r\nwar, must be done by circumvention. Put on the skin; I doubt not you can play\r\nthe bear nearly as well as myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been the private opinion of Uncas of their respective\r\nabilities in this particular, his grave countenance manifested no opinion of\r\nhis superiority. He silently and expeditiously encased himself in the covering\r\nof the beast, and then awaited such other movements as his more aged companion\r\nsaw fit to dictate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, addressing David, \xe2\x80\x9can exchange\r\nof garments will be a great convenience to you, inasmuch as you are but little\r\naccustomed to the make-shifts of the wilderness. Here, take my hunting shirt\r\nand cap, and give me your blanket and hat. You must trust me with the book and\r\nspectacles, as well as the tooter, too; if we ever meet again, in better times,\r\nyou shall have all back again, with many thanks into the bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid parted with the several articles named with a readiness that would have\r\ndone great credit to his liberality, had he not certainly profited, in many\r\nparticulars, by the exchange. Hawkeye was not long in assuming his borrowed\r\ngarments; and when his restless eyes were hid behind the glasses, and his head\r\nwas surmounted by the triangular beaver, as their statures were not dissimilar,\r\nhe might readily have passed for the singer, by starlight. As soon as these\r\ndispositions were made, the scout turned to David, and gave him his parting\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you much given to cowardice?\xe2\x80\x9d he bluntly asked, by way of\r\nobtaining a suitable understanding of the whole case before he ventured a\r\nprescription.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy pursuits are peaceful, and my temper, I humbly trust, is greatly\r\ngiven to mercy and love,\xe2\x80\x9d returned David, a little nettled at so direct\r\nan attack on his manhood; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there are none who can say that I have\r\never forgotten my faith in the Lord, even in the greatest straits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour chiefest danger will be at the moment when the savages find out\r\nthat they have been deceived. If you are not then knocked on the head, your\r\nbeing a non-composser will protect you; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll then have a good\r\nreason to expect to die in your bed. If you stay, it must be to sit down here\r\nin the shadow, and take the part of Uncas, until such times as the cunning of\r\nthe Indians discover the cheat, when, as I have already said, your times of\r\ntrial will come. So choose for yourself\xe2\x80\x94to make a rush or tarry\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, firmly; \xe2\x80\x9cI will abide in the place of\r\nthe Delaware. Bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf, and this, and\r\nmore, will I dare in his service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have spoken as a man, and like one who, under wiser schooling, would\r\nhave been brought to better things. Hold your head down, and draw in your legs;\r\ntheir formation might tell the truth too early. Keep silent as long as may be;\r\nand it would be wise, when you do speak, to break out suddenly in one of your\r\nshoutings, which will serve to remind the Indians that you are not altogether\r\nas responsible as men should be. If however, they take your scalp, as I trust\r\nand believe they will not, depend on it, Uncas and I will not forget the deed,\r\nbut revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d said David, perceiving that with this assurance they were\r\nabout to leave him; \xe2\x80\x9cI am an unworthy and humble follower of one who\r\ntaught not the damnable principle of revenge. Should I fall, therefore, seek no\r\nvictims to my manes, but rather forgive my destroyers; and if you remember them\r\nat all, let it be in prayers for the enlightening of their minds, and for their\r\neternal welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout hesitated, and appeared to muse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a principle in that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent from the\r\nlaw of the woods; and yet it is fair and noble to reflect upon.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nheaving a heavy sigh, probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a\r\ncondition he had so long abandoned, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cit is what I would wish to\r\npractise myself, as one without a cross of blood, though it is not always easy\r\nto deal with an Indian as you would with a fellow Christian. God bless you,\r\nfriend; I do believe your scent is not greatly wrong, when the matter is duly\r\nconsidered, and keeping eternity before the eyes, though much depends on the\r\nnatural gifts, and the force of temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, the scout returned and shook David cordially by the hand; after\r\nwhich act of friendship he immediately left the lodge, attended by the new\r\nrepresentative of the beast.\r\n\r\nThe instant Hawkeye found himself under the observation of the Hurons, he drew\r\nup his tall form in the rigid manner of David, threw out his arm in the act of\r\nkeeping time, and commenced what he intended for an imitation of his psalmody.\r\nHappily for the success of this delicate adventure, he had to deal with ears\r\nbut little practised in the concord of sweet sounds, or the miserable effort\r\nwould infallibly have been detected. It was necessary to pass within a\r\ndangerous proximity of the dark group of the savages, and the voice of the\r\nscout grew louder as they drew nigher. When at the nearest point the Huron who\r\nspoke the English thrust out an arm, and stopped the supposed singing-master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Delaware dog!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, leaning forward, and peering through\r\nthe dim light to catch the expression of the other\xe2\x80\x99s features; \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nhe afraid? Will the Hurons hear his groans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA growl, so exceedingly fierce and natural, proceeded from the beast, that the\r\nyoung Indian released his hold and started aside, as if to assure himself that\r\nit was not a veritable bear, and no counterfeit, that was rolling before him.\r\nHawkeye, who feared his voice would betray him to his subtle enemies, gladly\r\nprofited by the interruption, to break out anew in such a burst of musical\r\nexpression as would, probably, in a more refined state of society have been\r\ntermed \xe2\x80\x9ca grand crash.\xe2\x80\x9d Among his actual auditors, however, it\r\nmerely gave him an additional claim to that respect which they never withhold\r\nfrom such as are believed to be the subjects of mental alienation. The little\r\nknot of Indians drew back in a body, and suffered, as they thought, the\r\nconjurer and his inspired assistant to proceed.\r\n\r\nIt required no common exercise of fortitude in Uncas and the scout to continue\r\nthe dignified and deliberate pace they had assumed in passing the lodge;\r\nespecially as they immediately perceived that curiosity had so far mastered\r\nfear, as to induce the watchers to approach the hut, in order to witness the\r\neffect of the incantations. The least injudicious or impatient movement on the\r\npart of David might betray them, and time was absolutely necessary to insure\r\nthe safety of the scout. The loud noise the latter conceived it politic to\r\ncontinue, drew many curious gazers to the doors of the different huts as thy\r\npassed; and once or twice a dark-looking warrior stepped across their path, led\r\nto the act by superstition and watchfulness. They were not, however,\r\ninterrupted, the darkness of the hour, and the boldness of the attempt, proving\r\ntheir principal friends.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers had got clear of the village, and were now swiftly approaching\r\nthe shelter of the woods, when a loud and long cry arose from the lodge where\r\nUncas had been confined. The Mohican started on his feet, and shook his shaggy\r\ncovering, as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some\r\ndesperate effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, grasping his friend by the shoulder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet them yell again! \xe2\x80\x99Twas nothing but wonderment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had no occasion to delay, for at the next instant a burst of cries filled\r\nthe outer air, and ran along the whole extent of the village. Uncas cast his\r\nskin, and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions. Hawkeye tapped him\r\nlightly on the shoulder, and glided ahead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let the devils strike our scent!\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, tearing two\r\nrifles, with all their attendant accouterments, from beneath a bush, and\r\nflourishing \xe2\x80\x9ckilldeer\xe2\x80\x9d as he handed Uncas his weapon; \xe2\x80\x9ctwo,\r\nat least, will find it to their deaths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, throwing their pieces to a low trail, like sportsmen in readiness for\r\ntheir game, they dashed forward, and were soon buried in the somber darkness of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnt. I shall remember: When C\xe2\x80\x99sar says\r\nDo this, it is performed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Julius Caesar\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impatience of the savages who lingered about the prison of Uncas, as has\r\nbeen seen, had overcome their dread of the conjurer\xe2\x80\x99s breath. They stole\r\ncautiously, and with beating hearts, to a crevice, through which the faint\r\nlight of the fire was glimmering. For several minutes they mistook the form of\r\nDavid for that of the prisoner; but the very accident which Hawkeye had\r\nforeseen occurred. Tired of keeping the extremities of his long person so near\r\ntogether, the singer gradually suffered the lower limbs to extend themselves,\r\nuntil one of his misshapen feet actually came in contact with and shoved aside\r\nthe embers of the fire. At first the Hurons believed the Delaware had been thus\r\ndeformed by witchcraft. But when David, unconscious of being observed, turned\r\nhis head, and exposed his simple, mild countenance, in place of the haughty\r\nlineaments of their prisoner, it would have exceeded the credulity of even a\r\nnative to have doubted any longer. They rushed together into the lodge, and,\r\nlaying their hands, with but little ceremony, on their captive, immediately\r\ndetected the imposition. Then arose the cry first heard by the fugitives. It\r\nwas succeeded by the most frantic and angry demonstrations of vengeance. David,\r\nhowever, firm in his determination to cover the retreat of his friends, was\r\ncompelled to believe that his own final hour had come. Deprived of his book and\r\nhis pipe, he was fain to trust to a memory that rarely failed him on such\r\nsubjects; and breaking forth in a loud and impassioned strain, he endeavored to\r\nsmooth his passage into the other world by singing the opening verse of a\r\nfuneral anthem. The Indians were seasonably reminded of his infirmity, and,\r\nrushing into the open air, they aroused the village in the manner described.\r\n\r\nA native warrior fights as he sleeps, without the protection of anything\r\ndefensive. The sounds of the alarm were, therefore, hardly uttered before two\r\nhundred men were afoot, and ready for the battle or the chase, as either might\r\nbe required. The escape was soon known; and the whole tribe crowded, in a body,\r\naround the council-lodge, impatiently awaiting the instruction of their chiefs.\r\nIn such a sudden demand on their wisdom, the presence of the cunning Magua\r\ncould scarcely fail of being needed. His name was mentioned, and all looked\r\nround in wonder that he did not appear. Messengers were then despatched to his\r\nlodge requiring his presence.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, some of the swiftest and most discreet of the young men were\r\nordered to make the circuit of the clearing, under cover of the woods, in order\r\nto ascertain that their suspected neighbors, the Delawares, designed no\r\nmischief. Women and children ran to and fro; and, in short, the whole\r\nencampment exhibited another scene of wild and savage confusion. Gradually,\r\nhowever, these symptoms of disorder diminished; and in a few minutes the oldest\r\nand most distinguished chiefs were assembled in the lodge, in grave\r\nconsultation.\r\n\r\nThe clamor of many voices soon announced that a party approached, who might be\r\nexpected to communicate some intelligence that would explain the mystery of the\r\nnovel surprise. The crowd without gave way, and several warriors entered the\r\nplace, bringing with them the hapless conjurer, who had been left so long by\r\nthe scout in duress.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this man was held in very unequal estimation among the Hurons,\r\nsome believing implicitly in his power, and others deeming him an impostor, he\r\nwas now listened to by all with the deepest attention. When his brief story was\r\nended, the father of the sick woman stepped forth, and, in a few pithy\r\nexpression, related, in his turn, what he knew. These two narratives gave a\r\nproper direction to the subsequent inquiries, which were now made with the\r\ncharacteristic cunning of savages.\r\n\r\nInstead of rushing in a confused and disorderly throng to the cavern, ten of\r\nthe wisest and firmest among the chiefs were selected to prosecute the\r\ninvestigation. As no time was to be lost, the instant the choice was made the\r\nindividuals appointed rose in a body and left the place without speaking. On\r\nreaching the entrance, the younger men in advance made way for their seniors;\r\nand the whole proceeded along the low, dark gallery, with the firmness of\r\nwarriors ready to devote themselves to the public good, though, at the same\r\ntime, secretly doubting the nature of the power with which they were about to\r\ncontend.\r\n\r\nThe outer apartment of the cavern was silent and gloomy. The woman lay in her\r\nusual place and posture, though there were those present who affirmed they had\r\nseen her borne to the woods by the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cmedicine of the white\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a direct and palpable contradiction of the tale related by the\r\nfather caused all eyes to be turned on him. Chafed by the silent imputation,\r\nand inwardly troubled by so unaccountable a circumstance, the chief advanced to\r\nthe side of the bed, and, stooping, cast an incredulous look at the features,\r\nas if distrusting their reality. His daughter was dead.\r\n\r\nThe unerring feeling of nature for a moment prevailed and the old warrior hid\r\nhis eyes in sorrow. Then, recovering his self-possession, he faced his\r\ncompanions, and, pointing toward the corpse, he said, in the language of his\r\npeople:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wife of my young man has left us! The Great Spirit is angry with his\r\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mournful intelligence was received in solemn silence. After a short pause,\r\none of the elder Indians was about to speak, when a dark-looking object was\r\nseen rolling out of an adjoining apartment, into the very center of the room\r\nwhere they stood. Ignorant of the nature of the beings they had to deal with,\r\nthe whole party drew back a little, and, rising on end, exhibited the distorted\r\nbut still fierce and sullen features of Magua. The discovery was succeeded by a\r\ngeneral exclamation of amazement.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as the true situation of the chief was understood, several\r\nknives appeared, and his limbs and tongue were quickly released. The Huron\r\narose, and shook himself like a lion quitting his lair. Not a word escaped him,\r\nthough his hand played convulsively with the handle of his knife, while his\r\nlowering eyes scanned the whole party, as if they sought an object suited to\r\nthe first burst of his vengeance.\r\n\r\nIt was happy for Uncas and the scout, and even David, that they were all beyond\r\nthe reach of his arm at such a moment; for, assuredly, no refinement in cruelty\r\nwould then have deferred their deaths, in opposition to the promptings of the\r\nfierce temper that nearly choked him. Meeting everywhere faces that he knew as\r\nfriends, the savage grated his teeth together like rasps of iron, and swallowed\r\nhis passion for want of a victim on whom to vent it. This exhibition of anger\r\nwas noted by all present; and from an apprehension of exasperating a temper\r\nthat was already chafed nearly to madness, several minutes were suffered to\r\npass before another word was uttered. When, however, suitable time had elapsed,\r\nthe oldest of the party spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend has found an enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he nigh that the\r\nHurons might take revenge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the Delaware die!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Magua, in a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\nAnother longer and expressive silence was observed, and was broken, as before,\r\nwith due precaution, by the same individual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mohican is swift of foot, and leaps far,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nmy young men are on his trail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Magua, in tones so deep and guttural, that\r\nthey seemed to proceed from his inmost chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn evil spirit has been among us, and the Delaware has blinded our\r\neyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn evil spirit!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the other, mockingly; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nthe spirit that has taken the lives of so many Hurons; the spirit that slew my\r\nyoung men at \xe2\x80\x98the tumbling river\xe2\x80\x99; that took their scalps at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98healing spring\xe2\x80\x99; and who has, now, bound the arms of Le Renard\r\nSubtil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf whom does my friend speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the dog who carries the heart and cunning of a Huron under a pale\r\nskin\xe2\x80\x94La Longue Carabine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pronunciation of so terrible a name produced the usual effect among his\r\nauditors. But when time was given for reflection, and the warriors remembered\r\nthat their formidable and daring enemy had even been in the bosom of their\r\nencampment, working injury, fearful rage took the place of wonder, and all\r\nthose fierce passions with which the bosom of Magua had just been struggling\r\nwere suddenly transferred to his companions. Some among them gnashed their\r\nteeth in anger, others vented their feelings in yells, and some, again, beat\r\nthe air as frantically as if the object of their resentment were suffering\r\nunder their blows. But this sudden outbreaking of temper as quickly subsided in\r\nthe still and sullen restraint they most affected in their moments of inaction.\r\n\r\nMagua, who had in his turn found leisure for reflection, now changed his\r\nmanner, and assumed the air of one who knew how to think and act with a dignity\r\nworthy of so grave a subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to my people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey wait for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companions consented in silence, and the whole of the savage party left the\r\ncavern and returned to the council-lodge. When they were seated, all eyes\r\nturned on Magua, who understood, from such an indication, that, by common\r\nconsent, they had devolved the duty of relating what had passed on him. He\r\narose, and told his tale without duplicity or reservation. The whole deception\r\npractised by both Duncan and Hawkeye was, of course, laid naked, and no room\r\nwas found, even for the most superstitious of the tribe, any longer to affix a\r\ndoubt on the character of the occurrences. It was but too apparent that they\r\nhad been insultingly, shamefully, disgracefully deceived. When he had ended,\r\nand resumed his seat, the collected tribe\xe2\x80\x94for his auditors, in substance,\r\nincluded all the fighting men of the party\xe2\x80\x94sat regarding each other like\r\nmen astonished equally at the audacity and the success of their enemies. The\r\nnext consideration, however, was the means and opportunities for revenge.\r\n\r\nAdditional pursuers were sent on the trail of the fugitives; and then the\r\nchiefs applied themselves, in earnest, to the business of consultation. Many\r\ndifferent expedients were proposed by the elder warriors, in succession, to all\r\nof which Magua was a silent and respectful listener. That subtle savage had\r\nrecovered his artifice and self-command, and now proceeded toward his object\r\nwith his customary caution and skill. It was only when each one disposed to\r\nspeak had uttered his sentiments, that he prepared to advance his own opinions.\r\nThey were given with additional weight from the circumstance that some of the\r\nrunners had already returned, and reported that their enemies had been traced\r\nso far as to leave no doubt of their having sought safety in the neighboring\r\ncamp of their suspected allies, the Delawares. With the advantage of possessing\r\nthis important intelligence, the chief warily laid his plans before his\r\nfellows, and, as might have been anticipated from his eloquence and cunning,\r\nthey were adopted without a dissenting voice. They were, briefly, as follows,\r\nboth in opinions and in motives.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that, in obedience to a policy rarely departed from,\r\nthe sisters were separated so soon as they reached the Huron village. Magua had\r\nearly discovered that in retaining the person of Alice, he possessed the most\r\neffectual check on Cora. When they parted, therefore, he kept the former within\r\nreach of his hand, consigning the one he most valued to the keeping of their\r\nallies. The arrangement was understood to be merely temporary, and was made as\r\nmuch with a view to flatter his neighbors as in obedience to the invariable\r\nrule of Indian policy.\r\n\r\nWhile goaded incessantly by these revengeful impulses that in a savage seldom\r\nslumber, the chief was still attentive to his more permanent personal\r\ninterests. The follies and disloyalty committed in his youth were to be\r\nexpiated by a long and painful penance, ere he could be restored to the full\r\nenjoyment of the confidence of his ancient people; and without confidence there\r\ncould be no authority in an Indian tribe. In this delicate and arduous\r\nsituation, the crafty native had neglected no means of increasing his\r\ninfluence; and one of the happiest of his expedients had been the success with\r\nwhich he had cultivated the favor of their powerful and dangerous neighbors.\r\nThe result of his experiment had answered all the expectations of his policy;\r\nfor the Hurons were in no degree exempt from that governing principle of\r\nnature, which induces man to value his gifts precisely in the degree that they\r\nare appreciated by others.\r\n\r\nBut, while he was making this ostensible sacrifice to general considerations,\r\nMagua never lost sight of his individual motives. The latter had been\r\nfrustrated by the unlooked-for events which had placed all his prisoners beyond\r\nhis control; and he now found himself reduced to the necessity of suing for\r\nfavors to those whom it had so lately been his policy to oblige.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the chiefs had proposed deep and treacherous schemes to surprise the\r\nDelawares and, by gaining possession of their camp, to recover their prisoners\r\nby the same blow; for all agreed that their honor, their interests, and the\r\npeace and happiness of their dead countrymen, imperiously required them\r\nspeedily to immolate some victims to their revenge. But plans so dangerous to\r\nattempt, and of such doubtful issue, Magua found little difficulty in\r\ndefeating. He exposed their risk and fallacy with his usual skill; and it was\r\nonly after he had removed every impediment, in the shape of opposing advice,\r\nthat he ventured to propose his own projects.\r\n\r\nHe commenced by flattering the self-love of his auditors; a never-failing\r\nmethod of commanding attention. When he had enumerated the many different\r\noccasions on which the Hurons had exhibited their courage and prowess, in the\r\npunishment of insults, he digressed in a high encomium on the virtue of wisdom.\r\nHe painted the quality as forming the great point of difference between the\r\nbeaver and other brutes; between the brutes and men; and, finally, between the\r\nHurons, in particular, and the rest of the human race. After he had\r\nsufficiently extolled the property of discretion, he undertook to exhibit in\r\nwhat manner its use was applicable to the present situation of their tribe. On\r\nthe one hand, he said, was their great pale father, the governor of the\r\nCanadas, who had looked upon his children with a hard eye since their tomahawks\r\nhad been so red; on the other, a people as numerous as themselves, who spoke a\r\ndifferent language, possessed different interests, and loved them not, and who\r\nwould be glad of any pretense to bring them in disgrace with the great white\r\nchief. Then he spoke of their necessities; of the gifts they had a right to\r\nexpect for their past services; of their distance from their proper\r\nhunting-grounds and native villages; and of the necessity of consulting\r\nprudence more, and inclination less, in so critical circumstances. When he\r\nperceived that, while the old men applauded his moderation, many of the\r\nfiercest and most distinguished of the warriors listened to these politic plans\r\nwith lowering looks, he cunningly led them back to the subject which they most\r\nloved. He spoke openly of the fruits of their wisdom, which he boldly\r\npronounced would be a complete and final triumph over their enemies. He even\r\ndarkly hinted that their success might be extended, with proper caution, in\r\nsuch a manner as to include the destruction of all whom they had reason to\r\nhate. In short, he so blended the warlike with the artful, the obvious with the\r\nobscure, as to flatter the propensities of both parties, and to leave to each\r\nsubject of hope, while neither could say it clearly comprehended his\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\nThe orator, or the politician, who can produce such a state of things, is\r\ncommonly popular with his contemporaries, however he may be treated by\r\nposterity. All perceived that more was meant than was uttered, and each one\r\nbelieved that the hidden meaning was precisely such as his own faculties\r\nenabled him to understand, or his own wishes led him to anticipate.\r\n\r\nIn this happy state of things, it is not surprising that the management of\r\nMagua prevailed. The tribe consented to act with deliberation, and with one\r\nvoice they committed the direction of the whole affair to the government of the\r\nchief who had suggested such wise and intelligible expedients.\r\n\r\nMagua had now attained one great object of all his cunning and enterprise. The\r\nground he had lost in the favor of his people was completely regained, and he\r\nfound himself even placed at the head of affairs. He was, in truth, their\r\nruler; and, so long as he could maintain his popularity, no monarch could be\r\nmore despotic, especially while the tribe continued in a hostile country.\r\nThrowing off, therefore, the appearance of consultation, he assumed the grave\r\nair of authority necessary to support the dignity of his office.\r\n\r\nRunners were despatched for intelligence in different directions; spies were\r\nordered to approach and feel the encampment of the Delawares; the warriors were\r\ndismissed to their lodges, with an intimation that their services would soon be\r\nneeded; and the women and children were ordered to retire, with a warning that\r\nit was their province to be silent. When these several arrangements were made,\r\nMagua passed through the village, stopping here and there to pay a visit where\r\nhe thought his presence might be flattering to the individual. He confirmed his\r\nfriends in their confidence, fixed the wavering, and gratified all. Then he\r\nsought his own lodge. The wife the Huron chief had abandoned, when he was\r\nchased from among his people, was dead. Children he had none; and he now\r\noccupied a hut, without companion of any sort. It was, in fact, the dilapidated\r\nand solitary structure in which David had been discovered, and whom he had\r\ntolerated in his presence, on those few occasions when they met, with the\r\ncontemptuous indifference of a haughty superiority.\r\n\r\nHither, then, Magua retired, when his labors of policy were ended. While others\r\nslept, however, he neither knew or sought repose. Had there been one\r\nsufficiently curious to have watched the movements of the newly elected chief,\r\nhe would have seen him seated in a corner of his lodge, musing on the subject\r\nof his future plans, from the hour of his retirement to the time he had\r\nappointed for the warriors to assemble again. Occasionally the air breathed\r\nthrough the crevices of the hut, and the low flame that fluttered about the\r\nembers of the fire threw their wavering light on the person of the sullen\r\nrecluse. At such moments it would not have been difficult to have fancied the\r\ndusky savage the Prince of Darkness brooding on his own fancied wrongs, and\r\nplotting evil.\r\n\r\nLong before the day dawned, however, warrior after warrior entered the solitary\r\nhut of Magua, until they had collected to the number of twenty. Each bore his\r\nrifle, and all the other accouterments of war, though the paint was uniformly\r\npeaceful. The entrance of these fierce-looking beings was unnoticed: some\r\nseating themselves in the shadows of the place, and others standing like\r\nmotionless statues, until the whole of the designated band was collected.\r\n\r\nThen Magua arose and gave the signal to proceed, marching himself in advance.\r\nThey followed their leader singly, and in that well-known order which has\r\nobtained the distinguishing appellation of \xe2\x80\x9cIndian file.\xe2\x80\x9d Unlike\r\nother men engaged in the spirit-stirring business of war, they stole from their\r\ncamp unostentatiously and unobserved resembling a band of gliding specters,\r\nmore than warriors seeking the bubble reputation by deeds of desperate daring.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking the path which led directly toward the camp of the Delawares,\r\nMagua led his party for some distance down the windings of the stream, and\r\nalong the little artificial lake of the beavers. The day began to dawn as they\r\nentered the clearing which had been formed by those sagacious and industrious\r\nanimals. Though Magua, who had resumed his ancient garb, bore the outline of a\r\nfox on the dressed skin which formed his robe, there was one chief of his party\r\nwho carried the beaver as his peculiar symbol, or \xe2\x80\x9ctotem.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwould have been a species of profanity in the omission, had this man passed so\r\npowerful a community of his fancied kindred, without bestowing some evidence of\r\nhis regard. Accordingly, he paused, and spoke in words as kind and friendly as\r\nif he were addressing more intelligent beings. He called the animals his\r\ncousins, and reminded them that his protecting influence was the reason they\r\nremained unharmed, while many avaricious traders were prompting the Indians to\r\ntake their lives. He promised a continuance of his favors, and admonished them\r\nto be grateful. After which, he spoke of the expedition in which he was himself\r\nengaged, and intimated, though with sufficient delicacy and circumlocution, the\r\nexpediency of bestowing on their relative a portion of that wisdom for which\r\nthey were so renowned.[1]\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nThese harangues of the beasts were frequent among the Indians. They often\r\naddress their victims in this way, reproaching them for cowardice or commending\r\ntheir resolution, as they may happen to exhibit fortitude or the reverse, in\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the utterance of this extraordinary address, the companions of the\r\nspeaker were as grave and as attentive to his language as though they were all\r\nequally impressed with its propriety. Once or twice black objects were seen\r\nrising to the surface of the water, and the Huron expressed pleasure,\r\nconceiving that his words were not bestowed in vain. Just as he ended his\r\naddress, the head of a large beaver was thrust from the door of a lodge, whose\r\nearthen walls had been much injured, and which the party had believed, from its\r\nsituation, to be uninhabited. Such an extraordinary sign of confidence was\r\nreceived by the orator as a highly favorable omen; and though the animal\r\nretreated a little precipitately, he was lavish of his thanks and\r\ncommendations.\r\n\r\nWhen Magua thought sufficient time had been lost in gratifying the family\r\naffection of the warrior, he again made the signal to proceed. As the Indians\r\nmoved away in a body, and with a step that would have been inaudible to the\r\nears of any common man, the same venerable-looking beaver once more ventured\r\nhis head from its cover. Had any of the Hurons turned to look behind them, they\r\nwould have seen the animal watching their movements with an interest and\r\nsagacity that might easily have been mistaken for reason. Indeed, so very\r\ndistinct and intelligible were the devices of the quadruped, that even the most\r\nexperienced observer would have been at a loss to account for its actions,\r\nuntil the moment when the party entered the forest, when the whole would have\r\nbeen explained, by seeing the entire animal issue from the lodge, uncasing, by\r\nthe act, the grave features of Chingachgook from his mask of fur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrief, I pray for you; for you see, \xe2\x80\x99tis a busy time with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Much Ado About Nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tribe, or rather half tribe, of Delawares, which has been so often\r\nmentioned, and whose present place of encampment was so nigh the temporary\r\nvillage of the Hurons, could assemble about an equal number of warriors with\r\nthe latter people. Like their neighbors, they had followed Montcalm into the\r\nterritories of the English crown, and were making heavy and serious inroads on\r\nthe hunting-grounds of the Mohawks; though they had seen fit, with the\r\nmysterious reserve so common among the natives, to withhold their assistance at\r\nthe moment when it was most required. The French had accounted for this\r\nunexpected defection on the part of their ally in various ways. It was the\r\nprevalent opinion, however, that they had been influenced by veneration for the\r\nancient treaty, that had once made them dependent on the Six Nations for\r\nmilitary protection, and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former\r\nmasters. As for the tribe itself, it had been content to announce to Montcalm,\r\nthrough his emissaries, with Indian brevity, that their hatchets were dull, and\r\ntime was necessary to sharpen them. The politic captain of the Canadas had\r\ndeemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend, than by any acts of\r\nill-judged severity to convert him into an open enemy.\r\n\r\nOn that morning when Magua led his silent party from the settlement of the\r\nbeavers into the forests, in the manner described, the sun rose upon the\r\nDelaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people, actively\r\nemployed in all the customary avocations of high noon. The women ran from lodge\r\nto lodge, some engaged in preparing their morning\xe2\x80\x99s meal, a few earnestly\r\nbent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits, but more pausing to\r\nexchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends. The warriors were\r\nlounging in groups, musing more than they conversed and when a few words were\r\nuttered, speaking like men who deeply weighed their opinions. The instruments\r\nof the chase were to be seen in abundance among the lodges; but none departed.\r\nHere and there a warrior was examining his arms, with an attention that is\r\nrarely bestowed on the implements, when no other enemy than the beasts of the\r\nforest is expected to be encountered. And occasionally, the eyes of a whole\r\ngroup were turned simultaneously toward a large and silent lodge in the center\r\nof the village, as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts.\r\n\r\nDuring the existence of this scene, a man suddenly appeared at the furthest\r\nextremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village. He was\r\nwithout arms, and his paint tended rather to soften than increase the natural\r\nsternness of his austere countenance. When in full view of the Delawares he\r\nstopped, and made a gesture of amity, by throwing his arm upward toward heaven,\r\nand then letting it fall impressively on his breast. The inhabitants of the\r\nvillage answered his salute by a low murmur of welcome, and encouraged him to\r\nadvance by similar indications of friendship. Fortified by these assurances,\r\nthe dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace, where it had stood\r\na moment, drawn in a strong outline against the blushing morning sky, and moved\r\nwith dignity into the very center of the huts. As he approached, nothing was\r\naudible but the rattling of the light silver ornaments that loaded his arms and\r\nneck, and the tinkling of the little bells that fringed his deerskin moccasins.\r\nHe made, as he advanced, many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed,\r\nneglecting to notice the women, however, like one who deemed their favor, in\r\nthe present enterprise, of no importance. When he had reached the group in\r\nwhich it was evident, by the haughtiness of their common mien, that the\r\nprincipal chiefs were collected, the stranger paused, and then the Delawares\r\nsaw that the active and erect form that stood before them was that of the\r\nwell-known Huron chief, Le Renard Subtil.\r\n\r\nHis reception was grave, silent, and wary. The warriors in front stepped aside,\r\nopening the way to their most approved orator by the action; one who spoke all\r\nthose languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wise Huron is welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Delaware, in the language of\r\nthe Maquas; \xe2\x80\x9che is come to eat his \xe2\x80\x98succotash\xe2\x80\x99,[1]\r\nwith his brothers of the lakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nA dish composed of cracked corn and beans. It is much used also by the\r\nwhites. By corn is meant maise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is come,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Magua, bending his head with the dignity of\r\nan eastern prince.\r\n\r\nThe chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist, they once more\r\nexchanged friendly salutations. Then the Delaware invited his guest to enter\r\nhis own lodge, and share his morning meal. The invitation was accepted; and the\r\ntwo warriors, attended by three or four of the old men, walked calmly away,\r\nleaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of\r\nso unusual a visit, and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word.\r\n\r\nDuring the short and frugal repast that followed, the conversation was\r\nextremely circumspect, and related entirely to the events of the hunt, in which\r\nMagua had so lately been engaged. It would have been impossible for the most\r\nfinished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a\r\nthing of course, than did his hosts, notwithstanding every individual present\r\nwas perfectly aware that it must be connected with some secret object and that\r\nprobably of importance to themselves. When the appetites of the whole were\r\nappeased, the squaws removed the trenchers and gourds, and the two parties\r\nbegan to prepare themselves for a subtle trial of their wits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the face of my great Canada father turned again toward his Huron\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the orator of the Delawares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was it ever otherwise?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Magua. \xe2\x80\x9cHe calls my\r\npeople \xe2\x80\x98most beloved\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false, and\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tomahawks of your young men have been very red.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so; but they are now bright and dull; for the Yengeese are dead,\r\nand the Delawares are our neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand, and\r\nremained silent. Then Magua, as if recalled to such a recollection, by the\r\nallusion to the massacre, demanded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes my prisoner give trouble to my brothers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe path between the Hurons and the Delawares is short and it is open;\r\nlet her be sent to my squaws, if she gives trouble to my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the chief of the latter nation, still\r\nmore emphatically.\r\n\r\nThe baffled Magua continued silent several minutes, apparently indifferent,\r\nhowever, to the repulse he had received in this his opening effort to regain\r\npossession of Cora.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo my young men leave the Delawares room on the mountains for their\r\nhunts?\xe2\x80\x9d he at length continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lenape are rulers of their own hills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other a\r\nlittle haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well. Justice is the master of a red-skin. Why should they\r\nbrighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other? Are not\r\nthe pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time.\r\n\r\nMagua waited a little, to permit his words to soften the feelings of the\r\nDelawares, before he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave there not been strange moccasins in the woods? Have not my brothers\r\nscented the feet of white men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet my Canada father come,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other, evasively;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chis children are ready to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the great chief comes, it is to smoke with the Indians in their\r\nwigwams. The Hurons say, too, he is welcome. But the Yengeese have long arms,\r\nand legs that never tire! My young men dreamed they had seen the trail of the\r\nYengeese nigh the village of the Delawares!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not find the Lenape asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well. The warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMagua, once more shifting his ground, when he found himself unable to penetrate\r\nthe caution of his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought gifts to my brother. His\r\nnation would not go on the warpath, because they did not think it well, but\r\ntheir friends have remembered where they lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had thus announced his liberal intention, the crafty chief arose, and\r\ngravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts. They\r\nconsisted principally of trinkets of little value, plundered from the\r\nslaughtered females of William Henry. In the division of the baubles the\r\ncunning Huron discovered no less art than in their selection. While he bestowed\r\nthose of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors, one of whom was\r\nhis host, he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors with such well-timed and\r\napposite compliments, as left them no ground of complaint. In short, the whole\r\nceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering,\r\nthat it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a\r\ngenerosity so aptly mingled with praise, in the eyes of those he addressed.\r\n\r\nThis well-judged and politic stroke on the part of Magua was not without\r\ninstantaneous results. The Delawares lost their gravity in a much more cordial\r\nexpression; and the host, in particular, after contemplating his own liberal\r\nshare of the spoil for some moments with peculiar gratification, repeated with\r\nstrong emphasis, the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother is a wise chief. He is welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hurons love their friends the Delawares,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Magua.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should they not? they are colored by the same sun, and their just\r\nmen will hunt in the same grounds after death. The red-skins should be friends,\r\nand look with open eyes on the white men. Has not my brother scented spies in\r\nthe woods?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Delaware, whose name in English signified \xe2\x80\x9cHard Heart,\xe2\x80\x9d an\r\nappellation that the French had translated into \xe2\x80\x9cle Coeur-dur,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nforgot that obduracy of purpose, which had probably obtained him so significant\r\na title. His countenance grew very sensibly less stern and he now deigned to\r\nanswer more directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been strange moccasins about my camp. They have been tracked\r\ninto my lodges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid my brother beat out the dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Magua, without adverting\r\nin any manner to the former equivocation of the chief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not do. The stranger is always welcome to the children of the\r\nLenape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stranger, but not the spy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould the Yengeese send their women as spies? Did not the Huron chief\r\nsay he took women in the battle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told no lie. The Yengeese have sent out their scouts. They have been\r\nin my wigwams, but they found there no one to say welcome. Then they fled to\r\nthe Delawares\xe2\x80\x94for, say they, the Delawares are our friends; their minds\r\nare turned from their Canada father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis insinuation was a home thrust, and one that in a more advanced state of\r\nsociety would have entitled Magua to the reputation of a skillful diplomatist.\r\nThe recent defection of the tribe had, as they well knew themselves, subjected\r\nthe Delawares to much reproach among their French allies; and they were now\r\nmade to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and\r\ndistrust. There was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to\r\nforesee that such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial\r\nto their future movements. Their distant villages, their hunting-grounds and\r\nhundreds of their women and children, together with a material part of their\r\nphysical force, were actually within the limits of the French territory.\r\nAccordingly, this alarming annunciation was received, as Magua intended, with\r\nmanifest disapprobation, if not with alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet my father look in my face,\xe2\x80\x9d said Le Coeur-dur; \xe2\x80\x9che will\r\nsee no change. It is true, my young men did not go out on the war-path; they\r\nhad dreams for not doing so. But they love and venerate the great white\r\nchief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the\r\ncamp of his children? When he is told a bloody Yengee smokes at your fire? That\r\nthe pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in and out among the\r\nDelawares? Go! my great Canada father is not a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the Yengee that the Delawares fear?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho has slain my young men? Who is the mortal enemy of my Great\r\nFather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue Carabine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Delaware warriors started at the well-known name, betraying by their\r\namazement, that they now learned, for the first time, one so famous among the\r\nIndian allies of France was within their power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does my brother mean?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Le Coeur-dur, in a tone that,\r\nby its wonder, far exceeded the usual apathy of his race.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Huron never lies!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Magua, coldly, leaning his head\r\nagainst the side of the lodge, and drawing his slight robe across his tawny\r\nbreast. \xe2\x80\x9cLet the Delawares count their prisoners; they will find one\r\nwhose skin is neither red nor pale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long and musing pause succeeded. The chief consulted apart with his\r\ncompanions, and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most\r\ndistinguished men of the tribe.\r\n\r\nAs warrior after warrior dropped in, they were each made acquainted, in turn,\r\nwith the important intelligence that Magua had just communicated. The air of\r\nsurprise, and the usual low, deep, guttural exclamation, were common to them\r\nall. The news spread from mouth to mouth, until the whole encampment became\r\npowerfully agitated. The women suspended their labors, to catch such syllables\r\nas unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors. The boys deserted\r\ntheir sports, and walking fearlessly among their fathers, looked up in curious\r\nadmiration, as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely\r\nexpressed the temerity of their hated foe. In short, every occupation was\r\nabandoned for the time, and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that\r\nthe tribe might freely indulge, after their own peculiar manner, in an open\r\nexpression of feeling.\r\n\r\nWhen the excitement had a little abated, the old men disposed themselves\r\nseriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe\r\nto perform, under circumstances of so much delicacy and embarrassment. During\r\nall these movements, and in the midst of the general commotion, Magua had not\r\nonly maintained his seat, but the very attitude he had originally taken,\r\nagainst the side of the lodge, where he continued as immovable, and,\r\napparently, as unconcerned, as if he had no interest in the result. Not a\r\nsingle indication of the future intentions of his hosts, however, escaped his\r\nvigilant eyes. With his consummate knowledge of the nature of the people with\r\nwhom he had to deal, he anticipated every measure on which they decided; and it\r\nmight almost be said, that, in many instances, he knew their intentions, even\r\nbefore they became known to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe council of the Delawares was short. When it was ended, a general bustle\r\nannounced that it was to be immediately succeeded by a solemn and formal\r\nassemblage of the nation. As such meetings were rare, and only called on\r\noccasions of the last importance, the subtle Huron, who still sat apart, a wily\r\nand dark observer of the proceedings, now knew that all his projects must be\r\nbrought to their final issue. He, therefore, left the lodge and walked silently\r\nforth to the place, in front of the encampment, whither the warriors were\r\nalready beginning to collect.\r\n\r\nIt might have been half an hour before each individual, including even the\r\nwomen and children, was in his place. The delay had been created by the grave\r\npreparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference.\r\nBut when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain, against\r\nwhose bosom the Delawares had constructed their encampment, most were seated;\r\nand as his bright rays darted from behind the outline of trees that fringed the\r\neminence, they fell upon as grave, as attentive, and as deeply interested a\r\nmultitude, as was probably ever before lighted by his morning beams. Its number\r\nsomewhat exceeded a thousand souls.\r\n\r\nIn a collection of so serious savages, there is never to be found any impatient\r\naspirant after premature distinction, standing ready to move his auditors to\r\nsome hasty, and, perhaps, injudicious discussion, in order that his own\r\nreputation may be the gainer. An act of so much precipitancy and presumption\r\nwould seal the downfall of precocious intellect forever. It rested solely with\r\nthe oldest and most experienced of the men to lay the subject of the conference\r\nbefore the people. Until such a one chose to make some movement, no deeds in\r\narms, no natural gifts, nor any renown as an orator, would have justified the\r\nslightest interruption. On the present occasion, the aged warrior whose\r\nprivilege it was to speak, was silent, seemingly oppressed with the magnitude\r\nof his subject. The delay had already continued long beyond the usual\r\ndeliberative pause that always preceded a conference; but no sign of impatience\r\nor surprise escaped even the youngest boy. Occasionally an eye was raised from\r\nthe earth, where the looks of most were riveted, and strayed toward a\r\nparticular lodge, that was, however, in no manner distinguished from those\r\naround it, except in the peculiar care that had been taken to protect it\r\nagainst the assaults of the weather.\r\n\r\nAt length one of those low murmurs, that are so apt to disturb a multitude, was\r\nheard, and the whole nation arose to their feet by a common impulse. At that\r\ninstant the door of the lodge in question opened, and three men, issuing from\r\nit, slowly approached the place of consultation. They were all aged, even\r\nbeyond that period to which the oldest present had reached; but one in the\r\ncenter, who leaned on his companions for support, had numbered an amount of\r\nyears to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain. His frame, which\r\nhad once been tall and erect, like the cedar, was now bending under the\r\npressure of more than a century. The elastic, light step of an Indian was gone,\r\nand in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground, inch\r\nby inch. His dark, wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with\r\nthe long white locks which floated on his shoulders, in such thickness, as to\r\nannounce that generations had probably passed away since they had last been\r\nshorn.\r\n\r\nThe dress of this patriarch\xe2\x80\x94for such, considering his vast age, in\r\nconjunction with his affinity and influence with his people, he might very\r\nproperly be termed\xe2\x80\x94was rich and imposing, though strictly after the\r\nsimple fashions of the tribe. His robe was of the finest skins, which had been\r\ndeprived of their fur, in order to admit of a hieroglyphical representation of\r\nvarious deeds in arms, done in former ages. His bosom was loaded with medals,\r\nsome in massive silver, and one or two even in gold, the gifts of various\r\nChristian potentates during the long period of his life. He also wore armlets,\r\nand cinctures above the ankles, of the latter precious metal. His head, on the\r\nwhole of which the hair had been permitted to grow, the pursuits of war having\r\nso long been abandoned, was encircled by a sort of plated diadem, which, in its\r\nturn, bore lesser and more glittering ornaments, that sparkled amid the glossy\r\nhues of three drooping ostrich feathers, dyed a deep black, in touching\r\ncontrast to the color of his snow-white locks. His tomahawk was nearly hid in\r\nsilver, and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure, which the sudden appearance\r\nof this venerated individual created, had a little subsided, the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTamenund\xe2\x80\x9d was whispered from mouth to mouth. Magua had often heard\r\nthe fame of this wise and just Delaware; a reputation that even proceeded so\r\nfar as to bestow on him the rare gift of holding secret communion with the\r\nGreat Spirit, and which has since transmitted his name, with some slight\r\nalteration, to the white usurpers of his ancient territory, as the imaginary\r\ntutelar saint[2]\r\nof a vast empire. The Huron chief, therefore, stepped eagerly out a little from\r\nthe throng, to a spot whence he might catch a nearer glimpse of the features of\r\nthe man, whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his own\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n [2]\r\nThe Americans sometimes called their tutelar saint Tamenay, a corruption of\r\nthe name of the renowned chief here introduced. There are many traditions which\r\nspeak of the character and power of Tamenund.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the old man were closed, as though the organs were wearied with\r\nhaving so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions. The color\r\nof his skin differed from that of most around him, being richer and darker, the\r\nlatter having been produced by certain delicate and mazy lines of complicated\r\nand yet beautiful figures, which had been traced over most of his person by the\r\noperation of tattooing. Notwithstanding the position of the Huron, he passed\r\nthe observant and silent Magua without notice, and leaning on his two venerable\r\nsupporters proceeded to the high place of the multitude, where he seated\r\nhimself in the center of his nation, with the dignity of a monarch and the air\r\nof a father.\r\n\r\nNothing could surpass the reverence and affection with which this unexpected\r\nvisit from one who belongs rather to another world than to this, was received\r\nby his people. After a suitable and decent pause, the principal chiefs arose,\r\nand, approaching the patriarch, they placed his hands reverently on their\r\nheads, seeming to entreat a blessing. The younger men were content with\r\ntouching his robe, or even drawing nigh his person, in order to breathe in the\r\natmosphere of one so aged, so just, and so valiant. None but the most\r\ndistinguished among the youthful warriors even presumed so far as to perform\r\nthe latter ceremony, the great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient\r\nhappiness to look upon a form so deeply venerated, and so well beloved. When\r\nthese acts of affection and respect were performed, the chiefs drew back again\r\nto their several places, and silence reigned in the whole encampment.\r\n\r\nAfter a short delay, a few of the young men, to whom instructions had been\r\nwhispered by one of the aged attendants of Tamenund, arose, left the crowd, and\r\nentered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much\r\nattention throughout that morning. In a few minutes they reappeared, escorting\r\nthe individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of\r\njudgment. The crowd opened in a lane; and when the party had re-entered, it\r\nclosed in again, forming a large and dense belt of human bodies, arranged in an\r\nopen circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe assembly seated, rising o\xe2\x80\x99er the rest,\r\nAchilles thus the king of men addressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Illiad\r\n\r\n\r\nCora stood foremost among the prisoners, entwining her arms in those of Alice,\r\nin the tenderness of sisterly love. Notwithstanding the fearful and menacing\r\narray of savages on every side of her, no apprehension on her own account could\r\nprevent the nobler-minded maiden from keeping her eyes fastened on the pale and\r\nanxious features of the trembling Alice. Close at their side stood Heyward,\r\nwith an interest in both, that, at such a moment of intense uncertainty,\r\nscarcely knew a preponderance in favor of her whom he most loved. Hawkeye had\r\nplaced himself a little in the rear, with a deference to the superior rank of\r\nhis companions, that no similarity in the state of their present fortunes could\r\ninduce him to forget. Uncas was not there.\r\n\r\nWhen perfect silence was again restored, and after the usual long, impressive\r\npause, one of the two aged chiefs who sat at the side of the patriarch arose,\r\nand demanded aloud, in very intelligible English:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of my prisoners is La Longue Carabine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither Duncan nor the scout answered. The former, however, glanced his eyes\r\naround the dark and silent assembly, and recoiled a pace, when they fell on the\r\nmalignant visage of Magua. He saw, at once, that this wily savage had some\r\nsecret agency in their present arraignment before the nation, and determined to\r\nthrow every possible impediment in the way of the execution of his sinister\r\nplans. He had witnessed one instance of the summary punishments of the Indians,\r\nand now dreaded that his companion was to be selected for a second. In this\r\ndilemma, with little or no time for reflection, he suddenly determined to cloak\r\nhis invaluable friend, at any or every hazard to himself. Before he had time,\r\nhowever, to speak, the question was repeated in a louder voice, and with a\r\nclearer utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us arms,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man haughtily replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand place\r\nus in yonder woods. Our deeds shall speak for us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the warrior whose name has filled our ears!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nchief, regarding Heyward with that sort of curious interest which seems\r\ninseparable from man, when first beholding one of his fellows to whom merit or\r\naccident, virtue or crime, has given notoriety. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has brought the\r\nwhite man into the camp of the Delawares?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy necessities. I come for food, shelter, and friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be. The woods are full of game. The head of a warrior needs no\r\nother shelter than a sky without clouds; and the Delawares are the enemies, and\r\nnot the friends of the Yengeese. Go, the mouth has spoken, while the heart said\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan, a little at a loss in what manner to proceed, remained silent; but the\r\nscout, who had listened attentively to all that passed, now advanced steadily\r\nto the front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I did not answer to the call for La Longue Carabine, was not owing\r\neither to shame or fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor neither one nor the other\r\nis the gift of an honest man. But I do not admit the right of the Mingoes to\r\nbestow a name on one whose friends have been mindful of his gifts, in this\r\nparticular; especially as their title is a lie, \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 being a\r\ngrooved barrel and no carabyne. I am the man, however, that got the name of\r\nNathaniel from my kin; the compliment of Hawkeye from the Delawares, who live\r\non their own river; and whom the Iroquois have presumed to style the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Long Rifle\xe2\x80\x99, without any warranty from him who is most concerned\r\nin the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of all present, which had hitherto been gravely scanning the person of\r\nDuncan, were now turned, on the instant, toward the upright iron frame of this\r\nnew pretender to the distinguished appellation. It was in no degree remarkable\r\nthat there should be found two who were willing to claim so great an honor, for\r\nimpostors, though rare, were not unknown among the natives; but it was\r\naltogether material to the just and severe intentions of the Delawares, that\r\nthere should be no mistake in the matter. Some of their old men consulted\r\ntogether in private, and then, as it would seem, they determined to interrogate\r\ntheir visitor on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother has said that a snake crept into my camp,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nchief to Magua; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Huron pointed to the scout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill a wise Delaware believe the barking of a wolf?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nDuncan, still more confirmed in the evil intentions of his ancient enemy:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca dog never lies, but when was a wolf known to speak the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Magua flashed fire; but suddenly recollecting the necessity of\r\nmaintaining his presence of mind, he turned away in silent disdain, well\r\nassured that the sagacity of the Indians would not fail to extract the real\r\nmerits of the point in controversy. He was not deceived; for, after another\r\nshort consultation, the wary Delaware turned to him again, and expressed the\r\ndetermination of the chiefs, though in the most considerate language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother has been called a liar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand his\r\nfriends are angry. They will show that he has spoken the truth. Give my\r\nprisoners guns, and let them prove which is the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua affected to consider the expedient, which he well knew proceeded from\r\ndistrust of himself, as a compliment, and made a gesture of acquiescence, well\r\ncontent that his veracity should be supported by so skillful a marksman as the\r\nscout. The weapons were instantly placed in the hands of the friendly\r\nopponents, and they were bid to fire, over the heads of the seated multitude,\r\nat an earthen vessel, which lay, by accident, on a stump, some fifty yards from\r\nthe place where they stood.\r\n\r\nHeyward smiled to himself at the idea of a competition with the scout, though\r\nhe determined to persevere in the deception, until apprised of the real designs\r\nof Magua.\r\n\r\nRaising his rifle with the utmost care, and renewing his aim three several\r\ntimes, he fired. The bullet cut the wood within a few inches of the vessel; and\r\na general exclamation of satisfaction announced that the shot was considered a\r\nproof of great skill in the use of a weapon. Even Hawkeye nodded his head, as\r\nif he would say, it was better than he expected. But, instead of manifesting an\r\nintention to contend with the successful marksman, he stood leaning on his\r\nrifle for more than a minute, like a man who was completely buried in thought.\r\nFrom this reverie, he was, however, awakened by one of the young Indians who\r\nhad furnished the arms, and who now touched his shoulder, saying in exceedingly\r\nbroken English:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan the pale face beat it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Huron!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the scout, raising the short rifle in his\r\nright hand, and shaking it at Magua, with as much apparent ease as if it were a\r\nreed; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, Huron, I could strike you now, and no power on earth could\r\nprevent the deed! The soaring hawk is not more certain of the dove than I am\r\nthis moment of you, did I choose to send a bullet to your heart! Why should I\r\nnot? Why!\xe2\x80\x94because the gifts of my color forbid it, and I might draw down\r\nevil on tender and innocent heads. If you know such a being as God, thank Him,\r\ntherefore, in your inward soul; for you have reason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flushed countenance, angry eye and swelling figure of the scout, produced a\r\nsensation of secret awe in all that heard him. The Delawares held their breath\r\nin expectation; but Magua himself, even while he distrusted the forbearance of\r\nhis enemy, remained immovable and calm, where he stood wedged in by the crowd,\r\nas one who grew to the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeat it,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the young Delaware at the elbow of the scout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeat what, fool!\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hawkeye, still flourishing\r\nthe weapon angrily above his head, though his eye no longer sought the person\r\nof Magua.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the white man is the warrior he pretends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the aged chief,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet him strike nigher to the mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout laughed aloud\xe2\x80\x94a noise that produced the startling effect of an\r\nunnatural sound on Heyward; then dropping the piece, heavily, into his extended\r\nleft hand, it was discharged, apparently by the shock, driving the fragments of\r\nthe vessel into the air, and scattering them on every side. Almost at the same\r\ninstant, the rattling sound of the rifle was heard, as he suffered it to fall,\r\ncontemptuously, to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe first impression of so strange a scene was engrossing admiration. Then a\r\nlow, but increasing murmur, ran through the multitude, and finally swelled into\r\nsounds that denoted a lively opposition in the sentiments of the spectators.\r\nWhile some openly testified their satisfaction at so unexampled dexterity, by\r\nfar the larger portion of the tribe were inclined to believe the success of the\r\nshot was the result of accident. Heyward was not slow to confirm an opinion\r\nthat was so favorable to his own pretensions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was chance!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cnone can shoot without an\r\naim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChance!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the excited woodsman, who was now stubbornly bent\r\non maintaining his identity at every hazard, and on whom the secret hints of\r\nHeyward to acquiesce in the deception were entirely lost. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes yonder\r\nlying Huron, too, think it chance? Give him another gun, and place us face to\r\nface, without cover or dodge, and let Providence, and our own eyes, decide the\r\nmatter atween us! I do not make the offer, to you, major; for our blood is of a\r\ncolor, and we serve the same master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the Huron is a liar, is very evident,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Heyward,\r\ncoolly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have yourself heard him assert you to be La Longue\r\nCarabine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt were impossible to say what violent assertion the stubborn Hawkeye would\r\nhave next made, in his headlong wish to vindicate his identity, had not the\r\naged Delaware once more interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hawk which comes from the clouds can return when he will,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cgive them the guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time the scout seized the rifle with avidity; nor had Magua, though he\r\nwatched the movements of the marksman with jealous eyes, any further cause for\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let it be proved, in the face of this tribe of Delawares, which is\r\nthe better man,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the scout, tapping the butt of his piece with that\r\nfinger which had pulled so many fatal triggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see that gourd hanging against yonder tree, major; if you are a\r\nmarksman fit for the borders, let me see you break its shell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan noted the object, and prepared himself to renew the trial. The gourd was\r\none of the usual little vessels used by the Indians, and it was suspended from\r\na dead branch of a small pine, by a thong of deerskin, at the full distance of\r\na hundred yards. So strangely compounded is the feeling of self-love, that the\r\nyoung soldier, while he knew the utter worthlessness of the suffrages of his\r\nsavage umpires, forgot the sudden motives of the contest in a wish to excel. It\r\nhad been seen, already, that his skill was far from being contemptible, and he\r\nnow resolved to put forth its nicest qualities. Had his life depended on the\r\nissue, the aim of Duncan could not have been more deliberate or guarded. He\r\nfired; and three or four young Indians, who sprang forward at the report,\r\nannounced with a shout, that the ball was in the tree, a very little on one\r\nside of the proper object. The warriors uttered a common ejaculation of\r\npleasure, and then turned their eyes, inquiringly, on the movements of his\r\nrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may do for the Royal Americans!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, laughing once\r\nmore in his own silent, heartfelt manner; \xe2\x80\x9cbut had my gun often turned so\r\nmuch from the true line, many a marten, whose skin is now in a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmuff, would still be in the woods; ay, and many a bloody Mingo, who has\r\ndeparted to his final account, would be acting his deviltries at this very day,\r\natween the provinces. I hope the squaw who owns the gourd has more of them in\r\nher wigwam, for this will never hold water again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout had shook his priming, and cocked his piece, while speaking; and, as\r\nhe ended, he threw back a foot, and slowly raised the muzzle from the earth:\r\nthe motion was steady, uniform, and in one direction. When on a perfect level,\r\nit remained for a single moment, without tremor or variation, as though both\r\nman and rifle were carved in stone. During that stationary instant, it poured\r\nforth its contents, in a bright, glancing sheet of flame. Again the young\r\nIndians bounded forward; but their hurried search and disappointed looks\r\nannounced that no traces of the bullet were to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old chief to the scout, in a tone of strong disgust;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthou art a wolf in the skin of a dog. I will talk to the \xe2\x80\x98Long\r\nRifle\xe2\x80\x99 of the Yengeese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! had I that piece which furnished the name you use, I would obligate\r\nmyself to cut the thong, and drop the gourd without breaking it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Hawkeye, perfectly undisturbed by the other\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFools, if you would find the bullet of a sharpshooter in these woods,\r\nyou must look in the object, and not around it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian youths instantly comprehended his meaning\xe2\x80\x94for this time he\r\nspoke in the Delaware tongue\xe2\x80\x94and tearing the gourd from the tree, they\r\nheld it on high with an exulting shout, displaying a hole in its bottom, which\r\nhad been cut by the bullet, after passing through the usual orifice in the\r\ncenter of its upper side. At this unexpected exhibition, a loud and vehement\r\nexpression of pleasure burst from the mouth of every warrior present. It\r\ndecided the question, and effectually established Hawkeye in the possession of\r\nhis dangerous reputation. Those curious and admiring eyes which had been turned\r\nagain on Heyward, were finally directed to the weather-beaten form of the\r\nscout, who immediately became the principal object of attention to the simple\r\nand unsophisticated beings by whom he was surrounded. When the sudden and noisy\r\ncommotion had a little subsided, the aged chief resumed his examination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you wish to stop my ears?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Duncan;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9care the Delawares fools that they could not know the young panther from\r\nthe cat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will yet find the Huron a singing-bird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan,\r\nendeavoring to adopt the figurative language of the natives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is good. We will know who can shut the ears of men. Brother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded the chief turning his eyes on Magua, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Delawares listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus singled, and directly called on to declare his object, the Huron arose;\r\nand advancing with great deliberation and dignity into the very center of the\r\ncircle, where he stood confronted by the prisoners, he placed himself in an\r\nattitude to speak. Before opening his mouth, however, he bent his eyes slowly\r\nalong the whole living boundary of earnest faces, as if to temper his\r\nexpressions to the capacities of his audience. On Hawkeye he cast a glance of\r\nrespectful enmity; on Duncan, a look of inextinguishable hatred; the shrinking\r\nfigure of Alice he scarcely deigned to notice; but when his glance met the\r\nfirm, commanding, and yet lovely form of Cora, his eye lingered a moment, with\r\nan expression that it might have been difficult to define. Then, filled with\r\nhis own dark intentions, he spoke in the language of the Canadas, a tongue that\r\nhe well knew was comprehended by most of his auditors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Spirit that made men colored them differently,\xe2\x80\x9d commenced the\r\nsubtle Huron. \xe2\x80\x9cSome are blacker than the sluggish bear. These He said\r\nshould be slaves; and He ordered them to work forever, like the beaver. You may\r\nhear them groan, when the south wind blows, louder than the lowing buffaloes,\r\nalong the shores of the great salt lake, where the big canoes come and go with\r\nthem in droves. Some He made with faces paler than the ermine of the forests;\r\nand these He ordered to be traders; dogs to their women, and wolves to their\r\nslaves. He gave this people the nature of the pigeon; wings that never tire;\r\nyoung, more plentiful than the leaves on the trees, and appetites to devour the\r\nearth. He gave them tongues like the false call of the wildcat; hearts like\r\nrabbits; the cunning of the hog (but none of the fox), and arms longer than the\r\nlegs of the moose. With his tongue he stops the ears of the Indians; his heart\r\nteaches him to pay warriors to fight his battles; his cunning tells him how to\r\nget together the goods of the earth; and his arms inclose the land from the\r\nshores of the salt-water to the islands of the great lake. His gluttony makes\r\nhim sick. God gave him enough, and yet he wants all. Such are the pale faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome the Great Spirit made with skins brighter and redder than yonder\r\nsun,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Magua, pointing impressively upward to the lurid\r\nluminary, which was struggling through the misty atmosphere of the horizon;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand these did He fashion to His own mind. He gave them this island as He\r\nhad made it, covered with trees, and filled with game. The wind made their\r\nclearings; the sun and rain ripened their fruits; and the snows came to tell\r\nthem to be thankful. What need had they of roads to journey by! They saw\r\nthrough the hills! When the beavers worked, they lay in the shade, and looked\r\non. The winds cooled them in summer; in winter, skins kept them warm. If they\r\nfought among themselves, it was to prove that they were men. They were brave;\r\nthey were just; they were happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the speaker paused, and again looked around him to discover if his legend\r\nhad touched the sympathies of his listeners. He met everywhere, with eyes\r\nriveted on his own, heads erect and nostrils expanded, as if each individual\r\npresent felt himself able and willing, singly, to redress the wrongs of his\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Great Spirit gave different tongues to his red children,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe continued, in a low, still melancholy voice, \xe2\x80\x9cit was that all animals\r\nmight understand them. Some He placed among the snows, with their cousin, the\r\nbear. Some he placed near the setting sun, on the road to the happy hunting\r\ngrounds. Some on the lands around the great fresh waters; but to His greatest,\r\nand most beloved, He gave the sands of the salt lake. Do my brothers know the\r\nname of this favored people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the Lenape!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed twenty eager voices in a breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the Lenni Lenape,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Magua, affecting to bend his\r\nhead in reverence to their former greatness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the tribes of the\r\nLenape! The sun rose from water that was salt, and set in water that was sweet,\r\nand never hid himself from their eyes. But why should I, a Huron of the woods,\r\ntell a wise people their own traditions? Why remind them of their injuries;\r\ntheir ancient greatness; their deeds; their glory; their happiness; their\r\nlosses; their defeats; their misery? Is there not one among them who has seen\r\nit all, and who knows it to be true? I have done. My tongue is still for my\r\nheart is of lead. I listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the voice of the speaker suddenly ceased, every face and all eyes turned, by\r\na common movement, toward the venerable Tamenund. From the moment that he took\r\nhis seat, until the present instant, the lips of the patriarch had not severed,\r\nand scarcely a sign of life had escaped him. He sat bent in feebleness, and\r\napparently unconscious of the presence he was in, during the whole of that\r\nopening scene, in which the skill of the scout had been so clearly established.\r\nAt the nicely graduated sound of Magua\xe2\x80\x99s voice, however, he betrayed some\r\nevidence of consciousness, and once or twice he even raised his head, as if to\r\nlisten. But when the crafty Huron spoke of his nation by name, the eyelids of\r\nthe old man raised themselves, and he looked out upon the multitude with that\r\nsort of dull, unmeaning expression which might be supposed to belong to the\r\ncountenance of a specter. Then he made an effort to rise, and being upheld by\r\nhis supporters, he gained his feet, in a posture commanding by its dignity,\r\nwhile he tottered with weakness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho calls upon the children of the Lenape?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a deep,\r\nguttural voice, that was rendered awfully audible by the breathless silence of\r\nthe multitude; \xe2\x80\x9cwho speaks of things gone? Does not the egg become a\r\nworm\xe2\x80\x94the worm a fly, and perish? Why tell the Delawares of good that is\r\npast? Better thank the Manitou for that which remains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a Wyandot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Magua, stepping nigher to the rude platform\r\non which the other stood; \xe2\x80\x9ca friend of Tamenund.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the sage, on whose brow a dark frown settled,\r\nimparting a portion of that severity which had rendered his eye so terrible in\r\nmiddle age. \xe2\x80\x9cAre the Mingoes rulers of the earth? What brings a Huron in\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJustice. His prisoners are with his brothers, and he comes for his\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTamenund turned his head toward one of his supporters, and listened to the\r\nshort explanation the man gave.\r\n\r\nThen, facing the applicant, he regarded him a moment with deep attention; after\r\nwhich he said, in a low and reluctant voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJustice is the law of the great Manitou. My children, give the stranger\r\nfood. Then, Huron, take thine own and depart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the delivery of this solemn judgment, the patriarch seated himself, and\r\nclosed his eyes again, as if better pleased with the images of his own ripened\r\nexperience than with the visible objects of the world. Against such a decree\r\nthere was no Delaware sufficiently hardy to murmur, much less oppose himself.\r\nThe words were barely uttered when four or five of the younger warriors,\r\nstepping behind Heyward and the scout, passed thongs so dexterously and rapidly\r\naround their arms, as to hold them both in instant bondage. The former was too\r\nmuch engrossed with his precious and nearly insensible burden, to be aware of\r\ntheir intentions before they were executed; and the latter, who considered even\r\nthe hostile tribes of the Delawares a superior race of beings, submitted\r\nwithout resistance. Perhaps, however, the manner of the scout would not have\r\nbeen so passive, had he fully comprehended the language in which the preceding\r\ndialogue had been conducted.\r\n\r\nMagua cast a look of triumph around the whole assembly before he proceeded to\r\nthe execution of his purpose. Perceiving that the men were unable to offer any\r\nresistance, he turned his looks on her he valued most. Cora met his gaze with\r\nan eye so calm and firm, that his resolution wavered. Then, recollecting his\r\nformer artifice, he raised Alice from the arms of the warrior against whom she\r\nleaned, and beckoning Heyward to follow, he motioned for the encircling crowd\r\nto open. But Cora, instead of obeying the impulse he had expected, rushed to\r\nthe feet of the patriarch, and, raising her voice, exclaimed aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust and venerable Delaware, on thy wisdom and power we lean for mercy!\r\nBe deaf to yonder artful and remorseless monster, who poisons thy ears with\r\nfalsehoods to feed his thirst for blood. Thou that hast lived long, and that\r\nhast seen the evil of the world, should know how to temper its calamities to\r\nthe miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the old man opened heavily, and he once more looked upward at the\r\nmultitude. As the piercing tones of the suppliant swelled on his ears, they\r\nmoved slowly in the direction of her person, and finally settled there in a\r\nsteady gaze. Cora had cast herself to her knees; and, with hands clenched in\r\neach other and pressed upon her bosom, she remained like a beauteous and\r\nbreathing model of her sex, looking up in his faded but majestic countenance,\r\nwith a species of holy reverence. Gradually the expression of Tamenund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeatures changed, and losing their vacancy in admiration, they lighted with a\r\nportion of that intelligence which a century before had been wont to\r\ncommunicate his youthful fire to the extensive bands of the Delawares. Rising\r\nwithout assistance, and seemingly without an effort, he demanded, in a voice\r\nthat startled its auditors by its firmness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman. One of a hated race, if thou wilt\xe2\x80\x94a Yengee. But one who\r\nhas never harmed thee, and who cannot harm thy people, if she would; who asks\r\nfor succor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, my children,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the patriarch, hoarsely,\r\nmotioning to those around him, though his eyes still dwelt upon the kneeling\r\nform of Cora, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere have the Delawares camped?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the mountains of the Iroquois, beyond the clear springs of the\r\nHorican.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany parching summers are come and gone,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the sage,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince I drank of the water of my own rivers. The children of\r\nMinquon[1]\r\nare the justest white men, but they were thirsty and they took it to\r\nthemselves. Do they follow us so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nWilliam Penn was termed Minquon by the Delawares, and, as he never used\r\nviolence or injustice in his dealings with them, his reputation for probity\r\npassed into a proverb. The American is justly proud of the origin of his\r\nnation, which is perhaps unequaled in the history of the world; but the\r\nPennsylvanian and Jerseyman have more reason to value themselves in their\r\nancestors than the natives of any other state, since no wrong was done the\r\noriginal owners of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe follow none, we covet nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cora. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptives\r\nagainst our wills, have we been brought amongst you; and we ask but permission\r\nto depart to our own in peace. Art thou not Tamenund\xe2\x80\x94the father, the\r\njudge, I had almost said, the prophet\xe2\x80\x94of this people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Tamenund of many days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis now some seven years that one of thy people was at the mercy\r\nof a white chief on the borders of this province. He claimed to be of the blood\r\nof the good and just Tamenund. \xe2\x80\x98Go\xe2\x80\x99, said the white man, \xe2\x80\x98for\r\nthy parent\xe2\x80\x99s sake thou art free.\xe2\x80\x99 Dost thou remember the name of\r\nthat English warrior?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember, that when a laughing boy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the patriarch,\r\nwith the peculiar recollection of vast age, \xe2\x80\x9cI stood upon the sands of\r\nthe sea shore, and saw a big canoe, with wings whiter than the swan\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand wider than many eagles, come from the rising sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay; I speak not of a time so very distant, but of favor shown to\r\nthy kindred by one of mine, within the memory of thy youngest warrior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it when the Yengeese and the Dutchmanne fought for the\r\nhunting-grounds of the Delawares? Then Tamenund was a chief, and first laid\r\naside the bow for the lightning of the pale faces\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet then,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Cora, \xe2\x80\x9cby many ages; I speak of a\r\nthing of yesterday. Surely, surely, you forget it not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was but yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the aged man, with touching\r\npathos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the children of the Lenape were masters of the world. The\r\nfishes of the salt lake, the birds, the beasts, and the Mengee of the woods,\r\nowned them for Sagamores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCora bowed her head in disappointment, and, for a bitter moment struggled with\r\nher chagrin. Then, elevating her rich features and beaming eyes, she continued,\r\nin tones scarcely less penetrating than the unearthly voice of the patriarch\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, is Tamenund a father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man looked down upon her from his elevated stand, with a benignant\r\nsmile on his wasted countenance, and then casting his eyes slowly over the\r\nwhole assemblage, he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf a nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor myself I ask nothing. Like thee and thine, venerable chief,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe continued, pressing her hands convulsively on her heart, and suffering her\r\nhead to droop until her burning cheeks were nearly concealed in the maze of\r\ndark, glossy tresses that fell in disorder upon her shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cthe curse\r\nof my ancestors has fallen heavily on their child. But yonder is one who has\r\nnever known the weight of Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure until now. She is the\r\ndaughter of an old and failing man, whose days are near their close. She has\r\nmany, very many, to love her, and delight in her; and she is too good, much too\r\nprecious, to become the victim of that villain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that the pale faces are a proud and hungry race. I know that they\r\nclaim not only to have the earth, but that the meanest of their color is better\r\nthan the Sachems of the red man. The dogs and crows of their tribes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the earnest old chieftain, without heeding the wounded spirit of his\r\nlistener, whose head was nearly crushed to the earth in shame, as he proceeded,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould bark and caw before they would take a woman to their wigwams whose\r\nblood was not of the color of snow. But let them not boast before the face of\r\nthe Manitou too loud. They entered the land at the rising, and may yet go off\r\nat the setting sun. I have often seen the locusts strip the leaves from the\r\ntrees, but the season of blossoms has always come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cora, drawing a long breath, as if reviving from a\r\ntrance, raising her face, and shaking back her shining veil, with a kindling\r\neye, that contradicted the death-like paleness of her countenance; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94it is not permitted us to inquire. There is yet one of thine own\r\npeople who has not been brought before thee; before thou lettest the Huron\r\ndepart in triumph, hear him speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObserving Tamenund to look about him doubtingly, one of his companions said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a snake\xe2\x80\x94a red-skin in the pay of the Yengeese. We keep him\r\nfor the torture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him come,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sage.\r\n\r\nThen Tamenund once more sank into his seat, and a silence so deep prevailed\r\nwhile the young man prepared to obey his simple mandate, that the leaves, which\r\nfluttered in the draught of the light morning air, were distinctly heard\r\nrustling in the surrounding forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\r\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice:\r\nI stand for judgment: answer, shall I have it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silence continued unbroken by human sounds for many anxious minutes. Then\r\nthe waving multitude opened and shut again, and Uncas stood in the living\r\ncircle. All those eyes, which had been curiously studying the lineaments of the\r\nsage, as the source of their own intelligence, turned on the instant, and were\r\nnow bent in secret admiration on the erect, agile, and faultless person of the\r\ncaptive. But neither the presence in which he found himself, nor the exclusive\r\nattention that he attracted, in any manner disturbed the self-possession of the\r\nyoung Mohican. He cast a deliberate and observing look on every side of him,\r\nmeeting the settled expression of hostility that lowered in the visages of the\r\nchiefs with the same calmness as the curious gaze of the attentive children.\r\nBut when, last in this haughty scrutiny, the person of Tamenund came under his\r\nglance, his eye became fixed, as though all other objects were already\r\nforgotten. Then, advancing with a slow and noiseless step up the area, he\r\nplaced himself immediately before the footstool of the sage. Here he stood\r\nunnoted, though keenly observant himself, until one of the chiefs apprised the\r\nlatter of his presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what tongue does the prisoner speak to the Manitou?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded\r\nthe patriarch, without unclosing his eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what tongue does the prisoner speak to the Manitou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike his fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d Uncas replied; \xe2\x80\x9cwith the tongue of a\r\nDelaware.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this sudden and unexpected annunciation, a low, fierce yell ran through the\r\nmultitude, that might not inaptly be compared to the growl of the lion, as his\r\ncholer is first awakened\xe2\x80\x94a fearful omen of the weight of his future\r\nanger. The effect was equally strong on the sage, though differently exhibited.\r\nHe passed a hand before his eyes, as if to exclude the least evidence of so\r\nshameful a spectacle, while he repeated, in his low, guttural tones, the words\r\nhe had just heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Delaware! I have lived to see the tribes of the Lenape driven from\r\ntheir council-fires, and scattered, like broken herds of deer, among the hills\r\nof the Iroquois! I have seen the hatchets of a strong people sweep woods from\r\nthe valleys, that the winds of heaven have spared! The beasts that run on the\r\nmountains, and the birds that fly above the trees, have I seen living in the\r\nwigwams of men; but never before have I found a Delaware so base as to creep,\r\nlike a poisonous serpent, into the camps of his nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe singing-birds have opened their bills,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Uncas, in the\r\nsoftest notes of his own musical voice; \xe2\x80\x9cand Tamenund has heard their\r\nsong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sage started, and bent his head aside, as if to catch the fleeting sounds\r\nof some passing melody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Tamenund dream!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat voice is at his\r\near! Have the winters gone backward! Will summer come again to the children of\r\nthe Lenape!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA solemn and respectful silence succeeded this incoherent burst from the lips\r\nof the Delaware prophet. His people readily constructed his unintelligible\r\nlanguage into one of those mysterious conferences he was believed to hold so\r\nfrequently with a superior intelligence and they awaited the issue of the\r\nrevelation in awe. After a patient pause, however, one of the aged men,\r\nperceiving that the sage had lost the recollection of the subject before them,\r\nventured to remind him again of the presence of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe false Delaware trembles lest he should hear the words of\r\nTamenund,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a hound that howls, when the\r\nYengeese show him a trail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ye,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Uncas, looking sternly around him, \xe2\x80\x9care\r\ndogs that whine, when the Frenchman casts ye the offals of his deer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwenty knives gleamed in the air, and as many warriors sprang to their feet, at\r\nthis biting, and perhaps merited retort; but a motion from one of the chiefs\r\nsuppressed the outbreaking of their tempers, and restored the appearance of\r\nquiet. The task might probably have been more difficult, had not a movement\r\nmade by Tamenund indicated that he was again about to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelaware!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the sage, \xe2\x80\x9clittle art thou worthy of thy\r\nname. My people have not seen a bright sun in many winters; and the warrior who\r\ndeserts his tribe when hid in clouds is doubly a traitor. The law of the\r\nManitou is just. It is so; while the rivers run and the mountains stand, while\r\nthe blossoms come and go on the trees, it must be so. He is thine, my children;\r\ndeal justly by him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a limb was moved, nor was a breath drawn louder and longer than common,\r\nuntil the closing syllable of this final decree had passed the lips of\r\nTamenund. Then a cry of vengeance burst at once, as it might be, from the\r\nunited lips of the nation; a frightful augury of their ruthless intentions. In\r\nthe midst of these prolonged and savage yells, a chief proclaimed, in a high\r\nvoice, that the captive was condemned to endure the dreadful trial of torture\r\nby fire. The circle broke its order, and screams of delight mingled with the\r\nbustle and tumult of preparation. Heyward struggled madly with his captors; the\r\nanxious eye of Hawkeye began to look around him, with an expression of peculiar\r\nearnestness; and Cora again threw herself at the feet of the patriarch, once\r\nmore a suppliant for mercy.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of these trying moments, Uncas had alone preserved his\r\nserenity. He looked on the preparations with a steady eye, and when the\r\ntormentors came to seize him, he met them with a firm and upright attitude. One\r\namong them, if possible more fierce and savage than his fellows, seized the\r\nhunting-shirt of the young warrior, and at a single effort tore it from his\r\nbody. Then, with a yell of frantic pleasure, he leaped toward his unresisting\r\nvictim and prepared to lead him to the stake. But, at that moment, when he\r\nappeared most a stranger to the feelings of humanity, the purpose of the savage\r\nwas arrested as suddenly as if a supernatural agency had interposed in the\r\nbehalf of Uncas. The eyeballs of the Delaware seemed to start from their\r\nsockets; his mouth opened and his whole form became frozen in an attitude of\r\namazement. Raising his hand with a slow and regulated motion, he pointed with a\r\nfinger to the bosom of the captive. His companions crowded about him in wonder\r\nand every eye was like his own, fastened intently on the figure of a small\r\ntortoise, beautifully tattooed on the breast of the prisoner, in a bright blue\r\ntint.\r\n\r\nFor a single instant Uncas enjoyed his triumph, smiling calmly on the scene.\r\nThen motioning the crowd away with a high and haughty sweep of his arm, he\r\nadvanced in front of the nation with the air of a king, and spoke in a voice\r\nlouder than the murmur of admiration that ran through the multitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen of the Lenni Lenape!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy race upholds the\r\nearth! Your feeble tribe stands on my shell! What fire that a Delaware can\r\nlight would burn the child of my fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing proudly to\r\nthe simple blazonry on his skin; \xe2\x80\x9cthe blood that came from such a stock\r\nwould smother your flames! My race is the grandfather of nations!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Tamenund, rising at the startling tones he\r\nheard, more than at any meaning conveyed by the language of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncas, the son of Chingachgook,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the captive modestly,\r\nturning from the nation, and bending his head in reverence to the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter and years; \xe2\x80\x9ca son of the great Unamis.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nTurtle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hour of Tamenund is nigh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sage; \xe2\x80\x9cthe day\r\nis come, at last, to the night! I thank the Manitou, that one is here to fill\r\nmy place at the council-fire. Uncas, the child of Uncas, is found! Let the eyes\r\nof a dying eagle gaze on the rising sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth stepped lightly, but proudly on the platform, where he became visible\r\nto the whole agitated and wondering multitude. Tamenund held him long at the\r\nlength of his arm and read every turn in the fine lineaments of his\r\ncountenance, with the untiring gaze of one who recalled days of happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Tamenund a boy?\xe2\x80\x9d at length the bewildered prophet exclaimed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I dreamed of so many snows\xe2\x80\x94that my people were scattered like\r\nfloating sands\xe2\x80\x94of Yengeese, more plenty than the leaves on the trees! The\r\narrow of Tamenund would not frighten the fawn; his arm is withered like the\r\nbranch of a dead oak; the snail would be swifter in the race; yet is Uncas\r\nbefore him as they went to battle against the pale faces! Uncas, the panther of\r\nhis tribe, the eldest son of the Lenape, the wisest Sagamore of the Mohicans!\r\nTell me, ye Delawares, has Tamenund been a sleeper for a hundred\r\nwinters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe calm and deep silence which succeeded these words sufficiently announced\r\nthe awful reverence with which his people received the communication of the\r\npatriarch. None dared to answer, though all listened in breathless expectation\r\nof what might follow. Uncas, however, looking in his face with the fondness and\r\nveneration of a favored child, presumed on his own high and acknowledged rank,\r\nto reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour warriors of his race have lived and died,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince the friend of Tamenund led his people in battle. The blood of the\r\nturtle has been in many chiefs, but all have gone back into the earth from\r\nwhence they came, except Chingachgook and his son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true\xe2\x80\x94it is true,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sage, a flash of\r\nrecollection destroying all his pleasing fancies, and restoring him at once to\r\na consciousness of the true history of his nation. \xe2\x80\x9cOur wise men have\r\noften said that two warriors of the unchanged race were in the hills of the\r\nYengeese; why have their seats at the council-fires of the Delawares been so\r\nlong empty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words the young man raised his head, which he had still kept bowed a\r\nlittle, in reverence; and lifting his voice so as to be heard by the multitude,\r\nas if to explain at once and forever the policy of his family, he said aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce we slept where we could hear the salt lake speak in its anger. Then\r\nwe were rulers and Sagamores over the land. But when a pale face was seen on\r\nevery brook, we followed the deer back to the river of our nation. The\r\nDelawares were gone. Few warriors of them all stayed to drink of the stream\r\nthey loved. Then said my fathers, \xe2\x80\x98Here will we hunt. The waters of the\r\nriver go into the salt lake. If we go toward the setting sun, we shall find\r\nstreams that run into the great lakes of sweet water; there would a Mohican\r\ndie, like fishes of the sea, in the clear springs. When the Manitou is ready\r\nand shall say \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d we will follow the river to the sea, and take\r\nour own again.\xe2\x80\x99 Such, Delawares, is the belief of the children of the\r\nTurtle. Our eyes are on the rising and not toward the setting sun. We know\r\nwhence he comes, but we know not whither he goes. It is enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men of the Lenape listened to his words with all the respect that\r\nsuperstition could lend, finding a secret charm even in the figurative language\r\nwith which the young Sagamore imparted his ideas. Uncas himself watched the\r\neffect of his brief explanation with intelligent eyes, and gradually dropped\r\nthe air of authority he had assumed, as he perceived that his auditors were\r\ncontent. Then, permitting his looks to wander over the silent throng that\r\ncrowded around the elevated seat of Tamenund, he first perceived Hawkeye in his\r\nbonds. Stepping eagerly from his stand, he made way for himself to the side of\r\nhis friend; and cutting his thongs with a quick and angry stroke of his own\r\nknife, he motioned to the crowd to divide. The Indians silently obeyed, and\r\nonce more they stood ranged in their circle, as before his appearance among\r\nthem. Uncas took the scout by the hand, and led him to the feet of the\r\npatriarch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clook at this pale face; a just man, and\r\nthe friend of the Delawares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he a son of Minquon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so; a warrior known to the Yengeese, and feared by the\r\nMaquas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name has he gained by his deeds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe call him Hawkeye,\xe2\x80\x9d Uncas replied, using the Delaware phrase;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor his sight never fails. The Mingoes know him better by the death he\r\ngives their warriors; with them he is \xe2\x80\x98The Long Rifle\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue Carabine!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tamenund, opening his eyes, and\r\nregarding the scout sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son has not done well to call him\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call him so who proves himself such,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the young chief,\r\nwith great calmness, but with a steady mien. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Uncas is welcome among\r\nthe Delawares, then is Hawkeye with his friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pale face has slain my young men; his name is great for the blows he\r\nhas struck the Lenape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a Mingo has whispered that much in the ear of the Delaware, he has\r\nonly shown that he is a singing-bird,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, who now believed\r\nthat it was time to vindicate himself from such offensive charges, and who\r\nspoke as the man he addressed, modifying his Indian figures, however, with his\r\nown peculiar notions. \xe2\x80\x9cThat I have slain the Maquas I am not the man to\r\ndeny, even at their own council-fires; but that, knowingly, my hand has never\r\nharmed a Delaware, is opposed to the reason of my gifts, which is friendly to\r\nthem, and all that belongs to their nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA low exclamation of applause passed among the warriors who exchanged looks\r\nwith each other like men that first began to perceive their error.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the Huron?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Tamenund. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he stopped my\r\nears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua, whose feelings during that scene in which Uncas had triumphed may be\r\nmuch better imagined than described, answered to the call by stepping boldly in\r\nfront of the patriarch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe just Tamenund,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill not keep what a Huron has\r\nlent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, son of my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sage, avoiding the dark\r\ncountenance of Le Subtil, and turning gladly to the more ingenuous features of\r\nUncas, \xe2\x80\x9chas the stranger a conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s right over you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has none. The panther may get into snares set by the women; but he is\r\nstrong, and knows how to leap through them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Longue Carabine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaughs at the Mingoes. Go, Huron, ask your squaws the color of a\r\nbear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stranger and white maiden that come into my camp together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould journey on an open path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the woman that Huron left with my warriors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the woman that the Mingo has brought into my camp?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated\r\nTamenund, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Magua, shaking his hand in triumph at Uncas.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMohican, you know that she is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son is silent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tamenund, endeavoring to read the\r\nexpression of the face that the youth turned from him in sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so,\xe2\x80\x9d was the low answer.\r\n\r\nA short and impressive pause succeeded, during which it was very apparent with\r\nwhat reluctance the multitude admitted the justice of the Mingo\xe2\x80\x99s claim.\r\nAt length the sage, on whom alone the decision depended, said, in a firm voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuron, depart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs he came, just Tamenund,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the wily Magua, \xe2\x80\x9cor\r\nwith hands filled with the faith of the Delawares? The wigwam of Le Renard\r\nSubtil is empty. Make him strong with his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe aged man mused with himself for a time; and then, bending his head toward\r\none of his venerable companions, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre my ears open?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this Mingo a chief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first in his nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirl, what wouldst thou? A great warrior takes thee to wife. Go! thy\r\nrace will not end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter, a thousand times, it should,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the horror-struck\r\nCora, \xe2\x80\x9cthan meet with such a degradation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuron, her mind is in the tents of her fathers. An unwilling maiden\r\nmakes an unhappy wigwam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe speaks with the tongue of her people,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Magua,\r\nregarding his victim with a look of bitter irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is of a race of traders, and will bargain for a bright look. Let\r\nTamenund speak the words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake you the wampum, and our love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing hence but what Magua brought hither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen depart with thine own. The Great Manitou forbids that a Delaware\r\nshould be unjust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua advanced, and seized his captive strongly by the arm; the Delawares fell\r\nback, in silence; and Cora, as if conscious that remonstrance would be useless,\r\nprepared to submit to her fate without resistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, hold!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Duncan, springing forward; \xe2\x80\x9cHuron, have\r\nmercy! her ransom shall make thee richer than any of thy people were ever yet\r\nknown to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagua is a red-skin; he wants not the beads of the pale faces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGold, silver, powder, lead\xe2\x80\x94all that a warrior needs shall be in\r\nthy wigwam; all that becomes the greatest chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Subtil is very strong,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Magua, violently shaking the hand\r\nwhich grasped the unresisting arm of Cora; \xe2\x80\x9che has his revenge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMighty ruler of Providence!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Heyward, clasping his hands\r\ntogether in agony, \xe2\x80\x9ccan this be suffered! To you, just Tamenund, I appeal\r\nfor mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe words of the Delaware are said,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sage, closing\r\nhis eyes, and dropping back into his seat, alike wearied with his mental and\r\nhis bodily exertion. \xe2\x80\x9cMen speak not twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat a chief should not misspend his time in unsaying what has once been\r\nspoken is wise and reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, motioning to Duncan to be\r\nsilent; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is also prudent in every warrior to consider well before\r\nhe strikes his tomahawk into the head of his prisoner. Huron, I love you not;\r\nnor can I say that any Mingo has ever received much favor at my hands. It is\r\nfair to conclude that, if this war does not soon end, many more of your\r\nwarriors will meet me in the woods. Put it to your judgment, then, whether you\r\nwould prefer taking such a prisoner as that into your encampment, or one like\r\nmyself, who am a man that it would greatly rejoice your nation to see with\r\nnaked hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill \xe2\x80\x98The Long Rifle\xe2\x80\x99 give his life for the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded Magua, hesitatingly; for he had already made a motion toward quitting\r\nthe place with his victim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I have not said so much as that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hawkeye,\r\ndrawing back with suitable discretion, when he noted the eagerness with which\r\nMagua listened to his proposal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be an unequal exchange, to give\r\na warrior, in the prime of his age and usefulness, for the best woman on the\r\nfrontiers. I might consent to go into winter quarters, now \xe2\x80\x94at least six\r\nweeks afore the leaves will turn\xe2\x80\x94on condition you will release the\r\nmaiden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua shook his head, and made an impatient sign for the crowd to open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d added the scout, with the musing air of a man who had\r\nnot half made up his mind; \xe2\x80\x9cI will throw \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99 into the\r\nbargain. Take the word of an experienced hunter, the piece has not its equal\r\natween the provinces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMagua still disdained to reply, continuing his efforts to disperse the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d added the scout, losing his dissembled coolness exactly\r\nin proportion as the other manifested an indifference to the exchange,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I should condition to teach your young men the real virtue of the\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99pon, it would smoothe the little differences in our judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLe Renard fiercely ordered the Delawares, who still lingered in an impenetrable\r\nbelt around him, in hopes he would listen to the amicable proposal, to open his\r\npath, threatening, by the glance of his eye, another appeal to the infallible\r\njustice of their \xe2\x80\x9cprophet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is ordered must sooner or later arrive,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hawkeye,\r\nturning with a sad and humbled look to Uncas. \xe2\x80\x9cThe varlet knows his\r\nadvantage and will keep it! God bless you, boy; you have found friends among\r\nyour natural kin, and I hope they will prove as true as some you have met who\r\nhad no Indian cross. As for me, sooner or later, I must die; it is, therefore,\r\nfortunate there are but few to make my death-howl. After all, it is likely the\r\nimps would have managed to master my scalp, so a day or two will make no great\r\ndifference in the everlasting reckoning of time. God bless you,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nthe rugged woodsman, bending his head aside, and then instantly changing its\r\ndirection again, with a wistful look toward the youth; \xe2\x80\x9cI loved both you\r\nand your father, Uncas, though our skins are not altogether of a color, and our\r\ngifts are somewhat different. Tell the Sagamore I never lost sight of him in my\r\ngreatest trouble; and, as for you, think of me sometimes when on a lucky trail,\r\nand depend on it, boy, whether there be one heaven or two, there is a path in\r\nthe other world by which honest men may come together again. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nthe rifle in the place we hid it; take it, and keep it for my sake; and,\r\nharkee, lad, as your natural gifts don\xe2\x80\x99t deny you the use of vengeance,\r\nuse it a little freely on the Mingoes; it may unburden griefs at my loss, and\r\nease your mind. Huron, I accept your offer; release the woman. I am your\r\nprisoner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA suppressed, but still distinct murmur of approbation ran through the crowd at\r\nthis generous proposition; even the fiercest among the Delaware warriors\r\nmanifesting pleasure at the manliness of the intended sacrifice. Magua paused,\r\nand for an anxious moment, it might be said, he doubted; then, casting his eyes\r\non Cora, with an expression in which ferocity and admiration were strangely\r\nmingled, his purpose became fixed forever.\r\n\r\nHe intimated his contempt of the offer with a backward motion of his head, and\r\nsaid, in a steady and settled voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Renard Subtil is a great chief; he has but one mind. Come,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, laying his hand too familiarly on the shoulder of his captive to urge\r\nher onward; \xe2\x80\x9ca Huron is no tattler; we will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maiden drew back in lofty womanly reserve, and her dark eye kindled, while\r\nthe rich blood shot, like the passing brightness of the sun, into her very\r\ntemples, at the indignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am your prisoner, and, at a fitting time shall be ready to follow,\r\neven to my death. But violence is unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d she coldly said; and\r\nimmediately turning to Hawkeye, added: \xe2\x80\x9cGenerous hunter! from my soul I\r\nthank you. Your offer is vain, neither could it be accepted; but still you may\r\nserve me, even more than in your own noble intention. Look at that drooping\r\nhumbled child! Abandon her not until you leave her in the habitations of\r\ncivilized men. I will not say,\xe2\x80\x9d wringing the hard hand of the scout,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat her father will reward you\xe2\x80\x94for such as you are above the\r\nrewards of men\xe2\x80\x94but he will thank you and bless you. And, believe me, the\r\nblessing of a just and aged man has virtue in the sight of Heaven. Would to God\r\nI could hear one word from his lips at this awful moment!\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice\r\nbecame choked, and, for an instant, she was silent; then, advancing a step\r\nnigher to Duncan, who was supporting her unconscious sister, she continued, in\r\nmore subdued tones, but in which feeling and the habits of her sex maintained a\r\nfearful struggle: \xe2\x80\x9cI need not tell you to cherish the treasure you will\r\npossess. You love her, Heyward; that would conceal a thousand faults, though\r\nshe had them. She is kind, gentle, sweet, good, as mortal may be. There is not\r\na blemish in mind or person at which the proudest of you all would sicken. She\r\nis fair\xe2\x80\x94oh! how surpassingly fair!\xe2\x80\x9d laying her own beautiful, but\r\nless brilliant, hand in melancholy affection on the alabaster forehead of\r\nAlice, and parting the golden hair which clustered about her brows; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyet her soul is pure and spotless as her skin! I could say much\xe2\x80\x94more,\r\nperhaps, than cooler reason would approve; but I will spare you and\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice became inaudible, and her face was bent over the\r\nform of her sister. After a long and burning kiss, she arose, and with features\r\nof the hue of death, but without even a tear in her feverish eye, she turned\r\naway, and added, to the savage, with all her former elevation of manner:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, if it be your pleasure, I will follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, go,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Duncan, placing Alice in the arms of an Indian\r\ngirl; \xe2\x80\x9cgo, Magua, go. These Delawares have their laws, which forbid them\r\nto detain you; but I\xe2\x80\x94I have no such obligation. Go, malignant\r\nmonster\xe2\x80\x94why do you delay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to describe the expression with which Magua listened to\r\nthis threat to follow. There was at first a fierce and manifest display of joy,\r\nand then it was instantly subdued in a look of cunning coldness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe words are open,\xe2\x80\x9d he was content with answering,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Open Hand\xe2\x80\x99 can come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hawkeye, seizing Duncan by the arm, and detaining him\r\nby violence; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know not the craft of the imp. He would lead you to an\r\nambushment, and your death\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuron,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Uncas, who submissive to the stern customs of\r\nhis people, had been an attentive and grave listener to all that passed;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuron, the justice of the Delawares comes from the Manitou. Look at the\r\nsun. He is now in the upper branches of the hemlock. Your path is short and\r\nopen. When he is seen above the trees, there will be men on your trail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear a crow!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Magua, with a taunting laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, shaking his hand at the crowd, which had slowly\r\nopened to admit his passage. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the petticoats of the Delawares!\r\nLet them send their arrows and their guns to the Wyandots; they shall have\r\nvenison to eat, and corn to hoe. Dogs, rabbits, thieves\xe2\x80\x94I spit on\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis parting gibes were listened to in a dead, boding silence, and, with these\r\nbiting words in his mouth, the triumphant Magua passed unmolested into the\r\nforest, followed by his passive captive, and protected by the inviolable laws\r\nof Indian hospitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlue.\xe2\x80\x94Kill the poys and the luggage! \xe2\x80\x99Tis expressly against\r\nthe law of arms; \xe2\x80\x99tis as arrant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as can\r\nbe offered in the \xe2\x80\x99orld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94King Henry V.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long as their enemy and his victim continued in sight, the multitude\r\nremained motionless as beings charmed to the place by some power that was\r\nfriendly to the Huron; but, the instant he disappeared, it became tossed and\r\nagitated by fierce and powerful passion. Uncas maintained his elevated stand,\r\nkeeping his eyes on the form of Cora, until the colors of her dress were\r\nblended with the foliage of the forest; when he descended, and, moving silently\r\nthrough the throng, he disappeared in that lodge from which he had so recently\r\nissued. A few of the graver and more attentive warriors, who caught the gleams\r\nof anger that shot from the eyes of the young chief in passing, followed him to\r\nthe place he had selected for his meditations. After which, Tamenund and Alice\r\nwere removed, and the women and children were ordered to disperse. During the\r\nmomentous hour that succeeded, the encampment resembled a hive of troubled\r\nbees, who only awaited the appearance and example of their leader to take some\r\ndistant and momentous flight.\r\n\r\nA young warrior at length issued from the lodge of Uncas; and, moving\r\ndeliberately, with a sort of grave march, toward a dwarf pine that grew in the\r\ncrevices of the rocky terrace, he tore the bark from its body, and then turned\r\nwhence he came without speaking. He was soon followed by another, who stripped\r\nthe sapling of its branches, leaving it a naked and blazed[1]\r\ntrunk. A third colored the post with stripes of a dark red paint; all which\r\nindications of a hostile design in the leaders of the nation were received by\r\nthe men without in a gloomy and ominous silence. Finally, the Mohican himself\r\nreappeared, divested of all his attire, except his girdle and leggings, and\r\nwith one-half of his fine features hid under a cloud of threatening black.\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nA tree which has been partially or entirely stripped of its bark is said, in\r\nthe language of the country, to be \xe2\x80\x9cblazed.\xe2\x80\x9d The term is strictly\r\nEnglish, for a horse is said to be blazed when it has a white mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncas moved with a slow and dignified tread toward the post, which he\r\nimmediately commenced encircling with a measured step, not unlike an ancient\r\ndance, raising his voice, at the same time, in the wild and irregular chant of\r\nhis war song. The notes were in the extremes of human sounds; being sometimes\r\nmelancholy and exquisitely plaintive, even rivaling the melody of\r\nbirds\xe2\x80\x94and then, by sudden and startling transitions, causing the auditors\r\nto tremble by their depth and energy. The words were few and often repeated,\r\nproceeding gradually from a sort of invocation, or hymn, to the Deity, to an\r\nintimation of the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s object, and terminating as they commenced\r\nwith an acknowledgment of his own dependence on the Great Spirit. If it were\r\npossible to translate the comprehensive and melodious language in which he\r\nspoke, the ode might read something like the following: \xe2\x80\x9cManitou!\r\nManitou! Manitou! Thou art great, thou art good, thou art wise: Manitou!\r\nManitou! Thou art just. In the heavens, in the clouds, oh, I see many\r\nspots\xe2\x80\x94many dark, many red: In the heavens, oh, I see many clouds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the woods, in the air, oh, I hear the whoop, the long yell, and the\r\ncry: In the woods, oh, I hear the loud whoop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManitou! Manitou! Manitou! I am weak\xe2\x80\x94thou art strong; I am slow;\r\nManitou! Manitou! Give me aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the end of what might be called each verse he made a pause, by raising a\r\nnote louder and longer than common, that was peculiarly suited to the sentiment\r\njust expressed. The first close was solemn, and intended to convey the idea of\r\nveneration; the second descriptive, bordering on the alarming; and the third\r\nwas the well-known and terrific war-whoop, which burst from the lips of the\r\nyoung warrior, like a combination of all the frightful sounds of battle. The\r\nlast was like the first, humble and imploring. Three times did he repeat this\r\nsong, and as often did he encircle the post in his dance.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the first turn, a grave and highly esteemed chief of the Lenape\r\nfollowed his example, singing words of his own, however, to music of a similar\r\ncharacter. Warrior after warrior enlisted in the dance, until all of any renown\r\nand authority were numbered in its mazes. The spectacle now became wildly\r\nterrific; the fierce-looking and menacing visages of the chiefs receiving\r\nadditional power from the appalling strains in which they mingled their\r\nguttural tones. Just then Uncas struck his tomahawk deep into the post, and\r\nraised his voice in a shout, which might be termed his own battle cry. The act\r\nannounced that he had assumed the chief authority in the intended expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was a signal that awakened all the slumbering passions of the nation. A\r\nhundred youths, who had hitherto been restrained by the diffidence of their\r\nyears, rushed in a frantic body on the fancied emblem of their enemy, and\r\nsevered it asunder, splinter by splinter, until nothing remained of the trunk\r\nbut its roots in the earth. During this moment of tumult, the most ruthless\r\ndeeds of war were performed on the fragments of the tree, with as much apparent\r\nferocity as if they were the living victims of their cruelty. Some were\r\nscalped; some received the keen and trembling axe; and others suffered by\r\nthrusts from the fatal knife. In short, the manifestations of zeal and fierce\r\ndelight were so great and unequivocal, that the expedition was declared to be a\r\nwar of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe instant Uncas had struck the blow, he moved out of the circle, and cast his\r\neyes up to the sun, which was just gaining the point, when the truce with Magua\r\nwas to end. The fact was soon announced by a significant gesture, accompanied\r\nby a corresponding cry; and the whole of the excited multitude abandoned their\r\nmimic warfare, with shrill yells of pleasure, to prepare for the more hazardous\r\nexperiment of the reality.\r\n\r\nThe whole face of the encampment was instantly changed. The warriors, who were\r\nalready armed and painted, became as still as if they were incapable of any\r\nuncommon burst of emotion. On the other hand, the women broke out of the\r\nlodges, with the songs of joy and those of lamentation so strangely mixed that\r\nit might have been difficult to have said which passion preponderated. None,\r\nhowever, was idle. Some bore their choicest articles, others their young, and\r\nsome their aged and infirm, into the forest, which spread itself like a verdant\r\ncarpet of bright green against the side of the mountain. Thither Tamenund also\r\nretired, with calm composure, after a short and touching interview with Uncas;\r\nfrom whom the sage separated with the reluctance that a parent would quit a\r\nlong lost and just recovered child. In the meantime, Duncan saw Alice to a\r\nplace of safety, and then sought the scout, with a countenance that denoted how\r\neagerly he also panted for the approaching contest.\r\n\r\nBut Hawkeye was too much accustomed to the war song and the enlistments of the\r\nnatives, to betray any interest in the passing scene. He merely cast an\r\noccasional look at the number and quality of the warriors, who, from time to\r\ntime, signified their readiness to accompany Uncas to the field. In this\r\nparticular he was soon satisfied; for, as has been already seen, the power of\r\nthe young chief quickly embraced every fighting man in the nation. After this\r\nmaterial point was so satisfactorily decided, he despatched an Indian boy in\r\nquest of \xe2\x80\x9ckilldeer\xe2\x80\x9d and the rifle of Uncas, to the place where they\r\nhad deposited their weapons on approaching the camp of the Delawares; a measure\r\nof double policy, inasmuch as it protected the arms from their own fate, if\r\ndetained as prisoners, and gave them the advantage of appearing among the\r\nstrangers rather as sufferers than as men provided with means of defense and\r\nsubsistence. In selecting another to perform the office of reclaiming his\r\nhighly prized rifle, the scout had lost sight of none of his habitual caution.\r\nHe knew that Magua had not come unattended, and he also knew that Huron spies\r\nwatched the movements of their new enemies, along the whole boundary of the\r\nwoods. It would, therefore, have been fatal to himself to have attempted the\r\nexperiment; a warrior would have fared no better; but the danger of a boy would\r\nnot be likely to commence until after his object was discovered. When Heyward\r\njoined him, the scout was coolly awaiting the result of this experiment.\r\n\r\nThe boy, who had been well instructed, and was sufficiently crafty, proceeded,\r\nwith a bosom that was swelling with the pride of such a confidence, and all the\r\nhopes of young ambition, carelessly across the clearing to the wood, which he\r\nentered at a point at some little distance from the place where the guns were\r\nsecreted. The instant, however, he was concealed by the foliage of the bushes,\r\nhis dusky form was to be seen gliding, like that of a serpent, toward the\r\ndesired treasure. He was successful; and in another moment he appeared flying\r\nacross the narrow opening that skirted the base of the terrace on which the\r\nvillage stood, with the velocity of an arrow, and bearing a prize in each hand.\r\nHe had actually gained the crags, and was leaping up their sides with\r\nincredible activity, when a shot from the woods showed how accurate had been\r\nthe judgment of the scout. The boy answered it with a feeble but contemptuous\r\nshout; and immediately a second bullet was sent after him from another part of\r\nthe cover. At the next instant he appeared on the level above, elevating his\r\nguns in triumph, while he moved with the air of a conqueror toward the renowned\r\nhunter who had honored him by so glorious a commission.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the lively interest Hawkeye had taken in the fate of his\r\nmessenger, he received \xe2\x80\x9ckilldeer\xe2\x80\x9d with a satisfaction that,\r\nmomentarily, drove all other recollections from his mind. After examining the\r\npiece with an intelligent eye, and opening and shutting the pan some ten or\r\nfifteen times, and trying sundry other equally important experiments on the\r\nlock, he turned to the boy and demanded with great manifestations of kindness,\r\nif he was hurt. The urchin looked proudly up in his face, but made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I see, lad, the knaves have barked your arm!\xe2\x80\x9d added the scout,\r\ntaking up the limb of the patient sufferer, across which a deep flesh wound had\r\nbeen made by one of the bullets; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a little bruised alder will act\r\nlike a charm. In the meantime I will wrap it in a badge of wampum! You have\r\ncommenced the business of a warrior early, my brave boy, and are likely to bear\r\na plenty of honorable scars to your grave. I know many young men that have\r\ntaken scalps who cannot show such a mark as this. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d having bound up\r\nthe arm; \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be a chief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lad departed, prouder of his flowing blood than the vainest courtier could\r\nbe of his blushing ribbon; and stalked among the fellows of his age, an object\r\nof general admiration and envy.\r\n\r\nBut, in a moment of so many serious and important duties, this single act of\r\njuvenile fortitude did not attract the general notice and commendation it would\r\nhave received under milder auspices. It had, however, served to apprise the\r\nDelawares of the position and the intentions of their enemies. Accordingly a\r\nparty of adventurers, better suited to the task than the weak though spirited\r\nboy, was ordered to dislodge the skulkers. The duty was soon performed; for\r\nmost of the Hurons retired of themselves when they found they had been\r\ndiscovered. The Delawares followed to a sufficient distance from their own\r\nencampment, and then halted for orders, apprehensive of being led into an\r\nambush. As both parties secreted themselves, the woods were again as still and\r\nquiet as a mild summer morning and deep solitude could render them.\r\n\r\nThe calm but still impatient Uncas now collected his chiefs, and divided his\r\npower. He presented Hawkeye as a warrior, often tried, and always found\r\ndeserving of confidence. When he found his friend met with a favorable\r\nreception, he bestowed on him the command of twenty men, like himself, active,\r\nskillful and resolute. He gave the Delawares to understand the rank of Heyward\r\namong the troops of the Yengeese, and then tendered to him a trust of equal\r\nauthority. But Duncan declined the charge, professing his readiness to serve as\r\na volunteer by the side of the scout. After this disposition, the young Mohican\r\nappointed various native chiefs to fill the different situations of\r\nresponsibility, and, the time pressing, he gave forth the word to march. He was\r\ncheerfully, but silently obeyed by more than two hundred men.\r\n\r\nTheir entrance into the forest was perfectly unmolested; nor did they encounter\r\nany living objects that could either give the alarm, or furnish the\r\nintelligence they needed, until they came upon the lairs of their own scouts.\r\nHere a halt was ordered, and the chiefs were assembled to hold a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhispering council.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this meeting divers plans of operation were suggested, though none of a\r\ncharacter to meet the wishes of their ardent leader. Had Uncas followed the\r\npromptings of his own inclinations, he would have led his followers to the\r\ncharge without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay, and put the conflict to the hazard of an\r\ninstant issue; but such a course would have been in opposition to all the\r\nreceived practises and opinions of his countrymen. He was, therefore, fain to\r\nadopt a caution that in the present temper of his mind he execrated, and to\r\nlisten to advice at which his fiery spirit chafed, under the vivid recollection\r\nof Cora\xe2\x80\x99s danger and Magua\xe2\x80\x99s insolence.\r\n\r\nAfter an unsatisfactory conference of many minutes, a solitary individual was\r\nseen advancing from the side of the enemy, with such apparent haste, as to\r\ninduce the belief he might be a messenger charged with pacific overtures. When\r\nwithin a hundred yards, however, of the cover behind which the Delaware council\r\nhad assembled, the stranger hesitated, appeared uncertain what course to take,\r\nand finally halted. All eyes were turned now on Uncas, as if seeking directions\r\nhow to proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHawkeye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young chief, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9che must\r\nnever speak to the Hurons again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis time has come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the laconic scout, thrusting the long\r\nbarrel of his rifle through the leaves, and taking his deliberate and fatal\r\naim. But, instead of pulling the trigger, he lowered the muzzle again, and\r\nindulged himself in a fit of his peculiar mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cI took the imp for a\r\nMingo, as I\xe2\x80\x99m a miserable sinner!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when my eye\r\nranged along his ribs for a place to get the bullet in\xe2\x80\x94would you think\r\nit, Uncas\xe2\x80\x94I saw the musicianer\xe2\x80\x99s blower; and so, after all, it is\r\nthe man they call Gamut, whose death can profit no one, and whose life, if this\r\ntongue can do anything but sing, may be made serviceable to our own ends. If\r\nsounds have not lost their virtue, I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have a discourse with the\r\nhonest fellow, and that in a voice he\xe2\x80\x99ll find more agreeable than the\r\nspeech of \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, Hawkeye laid aside his rifle; and, crawling through the bushes until\r\nwithin hearing of David, he attempted to repeat the musical effort, which had\r\nconducted himself, with so much safety and eclat, through the Huron encampment.\r\nThe exquisite organs of Gamut could not readily be deceived (and, to say the\r\ntruth, it would have been difficult for any other than Hawkeye to produce a\r\nsimilar noise), and, consequently, having once before heard the sounds, he now\r\nknew whence they proceeded. The poor fellow appeared relieved from a state of\r\ngreat embarrassment; for, pursuing the direction of the voice\xe2\x80\x94a task that\r\nto him was not much less arduous that it would have been to have gone up in the\r\nface of a battery\xe2\x80\x94he soon discovered the hidden songster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what the Hurons will think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout,\r\nlaughing, as he took his companion by the arm, and urged him toward the rear.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the knaves lie within earshot, they will say there are two\r\nnon-compossers instead of one! But here we are safe,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing\r\nto Uncas and his associates. \xe2\x80\x9cNow give us the history of the Mingo\r\ninventions in natural English, and without any ups and downs of voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid gazed about him, at the fierce and wild-looking chiefs, in mute wonder;\r\nbut assured by the presence of faces that he knew, he soon rallied his\r\nfaculties so far as to make an intelligent reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heathen are abroad in goodly numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d said David; \xe2\x80\x9cand,\r\nI fear, with evil intent. There has been much howling and ungodly revelry,\r\ntogether with such sounds as it is profanity to utter, in their habitations\r\nwithin the past hour, so much so, in truth, that I have fled to the Delawares\r\nin search of peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ears might not have profited much by the exchange, had you been\r\nquicker of foot,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout a little dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut let that\r\nbe as it may; where are the Hurons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey lie hid in the forest, between this spot and their village in such\r\nforce, that prudence would teach you instantly to return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas cast a glance along the range of trees which concealed his own band and\r\nmentioned the name of:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagua?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs among them. He brought in the maiden that had sojourned with the\r\nDelawares; and, leaving her in the cave, has put himself, like a raging wolf,\r\nat the head of his savages. I know not what has troubled his spirit so\r\ngreatly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has left her, you say, in the cave!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Heyward;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis well that we know its situation! May not something be done\r\nfor her instant relief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncas looked earnestly at the scout, before he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat says Hawkeye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me twenty rifles, and I will turn to the right, along the stream;\r\nand, passing by the huts of the beaver, will join the Sagamore and the colonel.\r\nYou shall then hear the whoop from that quarter; with this wind one may easily\r\nsend it a mile. Then, Uncas, do you drive in the front; when they come within\r\nrange of our pieces, we will give them a blow that, I pledge the good name of\r\nan old frontiersman, shall make their line bend like an ashen bow. After which,\r\nwe will carry the village, and take the woman from the cave; when the affair\r\nmay be finished with the tribe, according to a white man\xe2\x80\x99s battle, by a\r\nblow and a victory; or, in the Indian fashion, with dodge and cover. There may\r\nbe no great learning, major, in this plan, but with courage and patience it can\r\nall be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it very much,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Duncan, who saw that the release of\r\nCora was the primary object in the mind of the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cI like it much.\r\nLet it be instantly attempted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a short conference, the plan was matured, and rendered more intelligible\r\nto the several parties; the different signals were appointed, and the chiefs\r\nseparated, each to his allotted station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,\r\nTill the great king, without a ransom paid,\r\nTo her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pope.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the time Uncas was making this disposition of his forces, the woods were\r\nas still, and, with the exception of those who had met in council, apparently\r\nas much untenanted as when they came fresh from the hands of their Almighty\r\nCreator. The eye could range, in every direction, through the long and shadowed\r\nvistas of the trees; but nowhere was any object to be seen that did not\r\nproperly belong to the peaceful and slumbering scenery.\r\n\r\nHere and there a bird was heard fluttering among the branches of the beeches,\r\nand occasionally a squirrel dropped a nut, drawing the startled looks of the\r\nparty for a moment to the place; but the instant the casual interruption\r\nceased, the passing air was heard murmuring above their heads, along that\r\nverdant and undulating surface of forest, which spread itself unbroken, unless\r\nby stream or lake, over such a vast region of country. Across the tract of\r\nwilderness which lay between the Delawares and the village of their enemies, it\r\nseemed as if the foot of man had never trodden, so breathing and deep was the\r\nsilence in which it lay. But Hawkeye, whose duty led him foremost in the\r\nadventure, knew the character of those with whom he was about to contend too\r\nwell to trust the treacherous quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw his little band collected, the scout threw \xe2\x80\x9ckilldeer\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninto the hollow of his arm, and making a silent signal that he would be\r\nfollowed, he led them many rods toward the rear, into the bed of a little brook\r\nwhich they had crossed in advancing. Here he halted, and after waiting for the\r\nwhole of his grave and attentive warriors to close about him, he spoke in\r\nDelaware, demanding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo any of my young men know whither this run will lead us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA Delaware stretched forth a hand, with the two fingers separated, and\r\nindicating the manner in which they were joined at the root, he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the sun could go his own length, the little water will be in the\r\nbig.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he added, pointing in the direction of the place he mentioned,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe two make enough for the beavers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout, glancing his eye upward at\r\nthe opening in the tree-tops, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the course it takes, and the bearings\r\nof the mountains. Men, we will keep within the cover of its banks till we scent\r\nthe Hurons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companions gave the usual brief exclamation of assent, but, perceiving that\r\ntheir leader was about to lead the way in person, one or two made signs that\r\nall was not as it should be. Hawkeye, who comprehended their meaning glances,\r\nturned and perceived that his party had been followed thus far by the\r\nsinging-master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the scout, gravely, and perhaps with a\r\nlittle of the pride of conscious deserving in his manner, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this is a\r\nband of rangers chosen for the most desperate service, and put under the\r\ncommand of one who, though another might say it with a better face, will not be\r\napt to leave them idle. It may not be five, it cannot be thirty minutes, before\r\nwe tread on the body of a Huron, living or dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough not admonished of your intentions in words,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nDavid, whose face was a little flushed, and whose ordinarily quiet and\r\nunmeaning eyes glimmered with an expression of unusual fire, \xe2\x80\x9cyour men\r\nhave reminded me of the children of Jacob going out to battle against the\r\nShechemites, for wickedly aspiring to wedlock with a woman of a race that was\r\nfavored of the Lord. Now, I have journeyed far, and sojourned much in good and\r\nevil with the maiden ye seek; and, though not a man of war, with my loins\r\ngirded and my sword sharpened, yet would I gladly strike a blow in her\r\nbehalf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout hesitated, as if weighing the chances of such a strange enlistment in\r\nhis mind before he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know not the use of any we\xe2\x80\x99pon. You carry no rifle; and\r\nbelieve me, what the Mingoes take they will freely give again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough not a vaunting and bloodily disposed Goliath,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nDavid, drawing a sling from beneath his parti-colored and uncouth attire,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not forgotten the example of the Jewish boy. With this ancient\r\ninstrument of war have I practised much in my youth, and peradventure the skill\r\nhas not entirely departed from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkeye, considering the deer-skin thong and apron, with\r\na cold and discouraging eye; \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing might do its work among arrows,\r\nor even knives; but these Mengwe have been furnished by the Frenchers with a\r\ngood grooved barrel a man. However, it seems to be your gift to go unharmed\r\namid fire; and as you have hitherto been favored\xe2\x80\x94major, you have left\r\nyour rifle at a cock; a single shot before the time would be just twenty scalps\r\nlost to no purpose\xe2\x80\x94singer, you can follow; we may find use for you in the\r\nshoutings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d returned David, supplying himself, like his\r\nroyal namesake, from among the pebbles of the brook; \xe2\x80\x9cthough not given to\r\nthe desire to kill, had you sent me away my spirit would have been\r\ntroubled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d added the scout, tapping his own head significantly on\r\nthat spot where Gamut was yet sore, \xe2\x80\x9cwe come to fight, and not to\r\nmusickate. Until the general whoop is given, nothing speaks but the\r\nrifle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid nodded, as much to signify his acquiescence with the terms; and then\r\nHawkeye, casting another observant glance over his followers made the signal to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nTheir route lay, for the distance of a mile, along the bed of the water-course.\r\nThough protected from any great danger of observation by the precipitous banks,\r\nand the thick shrubbery which skirted the stream, no precaution known to an\r\nIndian attack was neglected. A warrior rather crawled than walked on each flank\r\nso as to catch occasional glimpses into the forest; and every few minutes the\r\nband came to a halt, and listened for hostile sounds, with an acuteness of\r\norgans that would be scarcely conceivable to a man in a less natural state.\r\nTheir march was, however, unmolested, and they reached the point where the\r\nlesser stream was lost in the greater, without the smallest evidence that their\r\nprogress had been noted. Here the scout again halted, to consult the signs of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are likely to have a good day for a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in\r\nEnglish, addressing Heyward, and glancing his eyes upward at the clouds, which\r\nbegan to move in broad sheets across the firmament; \xe2\x80\x9ca bright sun and a\r\nglittering barrel are no friends to true sight. Everything is favorable; they\r\nhave the wind, which will bring down their noises and their smoke, too, no\r\nlittle matter in itself; whereas, with us it will be first a shot, and then a\r\nclear view. But here is an end to our cover; the beavers have had the range of\r\nthis stream for hundreds of years, and what atween their food and their dams,\r\nthere is, as you see, many a girdled stub, but few living trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkeye had, in truth, in these few words, given no bad description of the\r\nprospect that now lay in their front. The brook was irregular in its width,\r\nsometimes shooting through narrow fissures in the rocks, and at others\r\nspreading over acres of bottom land, forming little areas that might be termed\r\nponds. Everywhere along its bands were the moldering relics of dead trees, in\r\nall the stages of decay, from those that groaned on their tottering trunks to\r\nsuch as had recently been robbed of those rugged coats that so mysteriously\r\ncontain their principle of life. A few long, low, and moss-covered piles were\r\nscattered among them, like the memorials of a former and long-departed\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nAll these minute particulars were noted by the scout, with a gravity and\r\ninterest that they probably had never before attracted. He knew that the Huron\r\nencampment lay a short half mile up the brook; and, with the characteristic\r\nanxiety of one who dreaded a hidden danger, he was greatly troubled at not\r\nfinding the smallest trace of the presence of his enemy. Once or twice he felt\r\ninduced to give the order for a rush, and to attempt the village by surprise;\r\nbut his experience quickly admonished him of the danger of so useless an\r\nexperiment. Then he listened intently, and with painful uncertainty, for the\r\nsounds of hostility in the quarter where Uncas was left; but nothing was\r\naudible except the sighing of the wind, that began to sweep over the bosom of\r\nthe forest in gusts which threatened a tempest. At length, yielding rather to\r\nhis unusual impatience than taking counsel from his knowledge, he determined to\r\nbring matters to an issue, by unmasking his force, and proceeding cautiously,\r\nbut steadily, up the stream.\r\n\r\nThe scout had stood, while making his observations, sheltered by a brake, and\r\nhis companions still lay in the bed of the ravine, through which the smaller\r\nstream debouched; but on hearing his low, though intelligible, signal the whole\r\nparty stole up the bank, like so many dark specters, and silently arranged\r\nthemselves around him. Pointing in the direction he wished to proceed, Hawkeye\r\nadvanced, the band breaking off in single files, and following so accurately in\r\nhis footsteps, as to leave it, if we except Heyward and David, the trail of but\r\na single man.\r\n\r\nThe party was, however, scarcely uncovered before a volley from a dozen rifles\r\nwas heard in their rear; and a Delaware leaping high in to the air, like a\r\nwounded deer, fell at his whole length, dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I feared some deviltry like this!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the scout, in\r\nEnglish, adding, with the quickness of thought, in his adopted tongue:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo cover, men, and charge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe band dispersed at the word, and before Heyward had well recovered from his\r\nsurprise, he found himself standing alone with David. Luckily the Hurons had\r\nalready fallen back, and he was safe from their fire. But this state of things\r\nwas evidently to be of short continuance; for the scout set the example of\r\npressing on their retreat, by discharging his rifle, and darting from tree to\r\ntree as his enemy slowly yielded ground.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the assault had been made by a very small party of the\r\nHurons, which, however, continued to increase in numbers, as it retired on its\r\nfriends, until the return fire was very nearly, if not quite, equal to that\r\nmaintained by the advancing Delawares. Heyward threw himself among the\r\ncombatants, and imitating the necessary caution of his companions, he made\r\nquick discharges with his own rifle. The contest now grew warm and stationary.\r\nFew were injured, as both parties kept their bodies as much protected as\r\npossible by the trees; never, indeed, exposing any part of their persons except\r\nin the act of taking aim. But the chances were gradually growing unfavorable to\r\nHawkeye and his band. The quick-sighted scout perceived his danger without\r\nknowing how to remedy it. He saw it was more dangerous to retreat than to\r\nmaintain his ground: while he found his enemy throwing out men on his flank;\r\nwhich rendered the task of keeping themselves covered so very difficult to the\r\nDelawares, as nearly to silence their fire. At this embarrassing moment, when\r\nthey began to think the whole of the hostile tribe was gradually encircling\r\nthem, they heard the yell of combatants and the rattling of arms echoing under\r\nthe arches of the wood at the place where Uncas was posted, a bottom which, in\r\na manner, lay beneath the ground on which Hawkeye and his party were\r\ncontending.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this attack were instantaneous, and to the scout and his friends\r\ngreatly relieving. It would seem that, while his own surprise had been\r\nanticipated, and had consequently failed, the enemy, in their turn, having been\r\ndeceived in its object and in his numbers, had left too small a force to resist\r\nthe impetuous onset of the young Mohican. This fact was doubly apparent, by the\r\nrapid manner in which the battle in the forest rolled upward toward the\r\nvillage, and by an instant falling off in the number of their assailants, who\r\nrushed to assist in maintaining the front, and, as it now proved to be, the\r\nprincipal point of defense.\r\n\r\nAnimating his followers by his voice, and his own example, Hawkeye then gave\r\nthe word to bear down upon their foes. The charge, in that rude species of\r\nwarfare, consisted merely in pushing from cover to cover, nigher to the enemy;\r\nand in this maneuver he was instantly and successfully obeyed. The Hurons were\r\ncompelled to withdraw, and the scene of the contest rapidly changed from the\r\nmore open ground, on which it had commenced, to a spot where the assailed found\r\na thicket to rest upon. Here the struggle was protracted, arduous and seemingly\r\nof doubtful issue; the Delawares, though none of them fell, beginning to bleed\r\nfreely, in consequence of the disadvantage at which they were held.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis, Hawkeye found means to get behind the same tree as that which\r\nserved for a cover to Heyward; most of his own combatants being within call, a\r\nlittle on his right, where they maintained rapid, though fruitless, discharges\r\non their sheltered enemies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a young man, major,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, dropping the butt of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckilldeer\xe2\x80\x9d to the earth, and leaning on the barrel, a little\r\nfatigued with his previous industry; \xe2\x80\x9cand it may be your gift to lead\r\narmies, at some future day, ag\xe2\x80\x99in these imps, the Mingoes. You may here\r\nsee the philosophy of an Indian fight. It consists mainly in ready hand, a\r\nquick eye and a good cover. Now, if you had a company of the Royal Americans\r\nhere, in what manner would you set them to work in this business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bayonet would make a road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, there is white reason in what you say; but a man must ask himself,\r\nin this wilderness, how many lives he can spare. No\xe2\x80\x94horse[1],\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the scout, shaking his head, like one who mused; \xe2\x80\x9chorse, I am\r\nashamed to say must sooner or later decide these scrimmages. The brutes are\r\nbetter than men, and to horse must we come at last. Put a shodden hoof on the\r\nmoccasin of a red-skin, and, if his rifle be once emptied, he will never stop\r\nto load it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [1]\r\nThe American forest admits of the passage of horses, there being little\r\nunderbrush, and few tangled brakes. The plan of Hawkeye is the one which has\r\nalways proved the most successful in the battles between the whites and the\r\nIndians. Wayne, in his celebrated campaign on the Miami, received the fire of\r\nhis enemies in line; and then causing his dragoons to wheel round his flanks,\r\nthe Indians were driven from their covers before they had time to load. One of\r\nthe most conspicuous of the chiefs who fought in the battle of Miami assured\r\nthe writer, that the red men could not fight the warriors with \xe2\x80\x9clong\r\nknives and leather stockings\xe2\x80\x9d; meaning the dragoons with their sabers and\r\nboots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a subject that might better be discussed at another time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Heyward; \xe2\x80\x9cshall we charge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no contradiction to the gifts of any man in passing his breathing\r\nspells in useful reflections,\xe2\x80\x9d the scout replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to rush, I\r\nlittle relish such a measure; for a scalp or two must be thrown away in the\r\nattempt. And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, bending his head aside, to catch the sounds\r\nof the distant combat, \xe2\x80\x9cif we are to be of use to Uncas, these knaves in\r\nour front must be got rid of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, turning with a prompt and decided air, he called aloud to his Indians, in\r\ntheir own language. His words were answered by a shout; and, at a given signal,\r\neach warrior made a swift movement around his particular tree. The sight of so\r\nmany dark bodies, glancing before their eyes at the same instant, drew a hasty\r\nand consequently an ineffectual fire from the Hurons. Without stopping to\r\nbreathe, the Delawares leaped in long bounds toward the wood, like so many\r\npanthers springing upon their prey. Hawkeye was in front, brandishing his\r\nterrible rifle and animating his followers by his example. A few of the older\r\nand more cunning Hurons, who had not been deceived by the artifice which had\r\nbeen practiced to draw their fire, now made a close and deadly discharge of\r\ntheir pieces and justified the apprehensions of the scout by felling three of\r\nhis foremost warriors. But the shock was insufficient to repel the impetus of\r\nthe charge. The Delawares broke into the cover with the ferocity of their\r\nnatures and swept away every trace of resistance by the fury of the onset.\r\n\r\nThe combat endured only for an instant, hand to hand, and then the assailed\r\nyielded ground rapidly, until they reached the opposite margin of the thicket,\r\nwhere they clung to the cover, with the sort of obstinacy that is so often\r\nwitnessed in hunted brutes. At this critical moment, when the success of the\r\nstruggle was again becoming doubtful, the crack of a rifle was heard behind the\r\nHurons, and a bullet came whizzing from among some beaver lodges, which were\r\nsituated in the clearing, in their rear, and was followed by the fierce and\r\nappalling yell of the war-whoop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere speaks the Sagamore!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Hawkeye, answering the cry\r\nwith his own stentorian voice; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have them now in face and back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effect on the Hurons was instantaneous. Discouraged by an assault from a\r\nquarter that left them no opportunity for cover, the warriors uttered a common\r\nyell of disappointment, and breaking off in a body, they spread themselves\r\nacross the opening, heedless of every consideration but flight. Many fell, in\r\nmaking the experiment, under the bullets and the blows of the pursuing\r\nDelawares.\r\n\r\nWe shall not pause to detail the meeting between the scout and Chingachgook, or\r\nthe more touching interview that Duncan held with Munro. A few brief and\r\nhurried words served to explain the state of things to both parties; and then\r\nHawkeye, pointing out the Sagamore to his band, resigned the chief authority\r\ninto the hands of the Mohican chief. Chingachgook assumed the station to which\r\nhis birth and experience gave him so distinguished a claim, with the grave\r\ndignity that always gives force to the mandates of a native warrior. Following\r\nthe footsteps of the scout, he led the party back through the thicket, his men\r\nscalping the fallen Hurons and secreting the bodies of their own dead as they\r\nproceeded, until they gained a point where the former was content to make a\r\nhalt.\r\n\r\nThe warriors, who had breathed themselves freely in the preceding struggle,\r\nwere now posted on a bit of level ground, sprinkled with trees in sufficient\r\nnumbers to conceal them. The land fell away rather precipitately in front, and\r\nbeneath their eyes stretched, for several miles, a narrow, dark, and wooded\r\nvale. It was through this dense and dark forest that Uncas was still contending\r\nwith the main body of the Hurons.\r\n\r\nThe Mohican and his friends advanced to the brow of the hill, and listened,\r\nwith practised ears, to the sounds of the combat. A few birds hovered over the\r\nleafy bosom of the valley, frightened from their secluded nests; and here and\r\nthere a light vapory cloud, which seemed already blending with the atmosphere,\r\narose above the trees, and indicated some spot where the struggle had been\r\nfierce and stationary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fight is coming up the ascent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, pointing in the\r\ndirection of a new explosion of firearms; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are too much in the center\r\nof their line to be effective.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will incline into the hollow, where the cover is thicker,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the scout, \xe2\x80\x9cand that will leave us well on their flank. Go,\r\nSagamore; you will hardly be in time to give the whoop, and lead on the young\r\nmen. I will fight this scrimmage with warriors of my own color. You know me,\r\nMohican; not a Huron of them all shall cross the swell, into your rear, without\r\nthe notice of \xe2\x80\x98killdeer\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian chief paused another moment to consider the signs of the contest,\r\nwhich was now rolling rapidly up the ascent, a certain evidence that the\r\nDelawares triumphed; nor did he actually quit the place until admonished of the\r\nproximity of his friends, as well as enemies, by the bullets of the former,\r\nwhich began to patter among the dried leaves on the ground, like the bits of\r\nfalling hail which precede the bursting of the tempest. Hawkeye and his three\r\ncompanions withdrew a few paces to a shelter, and awaited the issue with\r\ncalmness that nothing but great practise could impart in such a scene.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the reports of the rifles began to lose the echoes of\r\nthe woods, and to sound like weapons discharged in the open air. Then a warrior\r\nappeared, here and there, driven to the skirts of the forest, and rallying as\r\nhe entered the clearing, as at the place where the final stand was to be made.\r\nThese were soon joined by others, until a long line of swarthy figures was to\r\nbe seen clinging to the cover with the obstinacy of desperation. Heyward began\r\nto grow impatient, and turned his eyes anxiously in the direction of\r\nChingachgook. The chief was seated on a rock, with nothing visible but his calm\r\nvisage, considering the spectacle with an eye as deliberate as if he were\r\nposted there merely to view the struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come for the Delaware to strike!\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, not so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the scout; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he scents his\r\nfriends, he will let them know that he is here. See, see; the knaves are\r\ngetting in that clump of pines, like bees settling after their flight. By the\r\nLord, a squaw might put a bullet into the center of such a knot of dark\r\nskins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that instant the whoop was given, and a dozen Hurons fell by a discharge\r\nfrom Chingachgook and his band. The shout that followed was answered by a\r\nsingle war-cry from the forest, and a yell passed through the air that sounded\r\nas if a thousand throats were united in a common effort. The Hurons staggered,\r\ndeserting the center of their line, and Uncas issued from the forest through\r\nthe opening they left, at the head of a hundred warriors.\r\n\r\nWaving his hands right and left, the young chief pointed out the enemy to his\r\nfollowers, who separated in pursuit. The war now divided, both wings of the\r\nbroken Hurons seeking protection in the woods again, hotly pressed by the\r\nvictorious warriors of the Lenape. A minute might have passed, but the sounds\r\nwere already receding in different directions, and gradually losing their\r\ndistinctness beneath the echoing arches of the woods. One little knot of\r\nHurons, however, had disdained to seek a cover, and were retiring, like lions\r\nat bay, slowly and sullenly up the acclivity which Chingachgook and his band\r\nhad just deserted, to mingle more closely in the fray. Magua was conspicuous in\r\nthis party, both by his fierce and savage mien, and by the air of haughty\r\nauthority he yet maintained.\r\n\r\nIn his eagerness to expedite the pursuit, Uncas had left himself nearly alone;\r\nbut the moment his eye caught the figure of Le Subtil, every other\r\nconsideration was forgotten. Raising his cry of battle, which recalled some six\r\nor seven warriors, and reckless of the disparity of their numbers, he rushed\r\nupon his enemy. Le Renard, who watched the movement, paused to receive him with\r\nsecret joy. But at the moment when he thought the rashness of his impetuous\r\nyoung assailant had left him at his mercy, another shout was given, and La\r\nLongue Carabine was seen rushing to the rescue, attended by all his white\r\nassociates. The Huron instantly turned, and commenced a rapid retreat up the\r\nascent.\r\n\r\nThere was no time for greetings or congratulations; for Uncas, though\r\nunconscious of the presence of his friends, continued the pursuit with the\r\nvelocity of the wind. In vain Hawkeye called to him to respect the covers; the\r\nyoung Mohican braved the dangerous fire of his enemies, and soon compelled them\r\nto a flight as swift as his own headlong speed. It was fortunate that the race\r\nwas of short continuance, and that the white men were much favored by their\r\nposition, or the Delaware would soon have outstripped all his companions, and\r\nfallen a victim to his own temerity. But, ere such a calamity could happen, the\r\npursuers and pursued entered the Wyandot village, within striking distance of\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nExcited by the presence of their dwellings, and tired of the chase, the Hurons\r\nnow made a stand, and fought around their council-lodge with the fury of\r\ndespair. The onset and the issue were like the passage and destruction of a\r\nwhirlwind. The tomahawk of Uncas, the blows of Hawkeye, and even the still\r\nnervous arm of Munro were all busy for that passing moment, and the ground was\r\nquickly strewed with their enemies. Still Magua, though daring and much\r\nexposed, escaped from every effort against his life, with that sort of fabled\r\nprotection that was made to overlook the fortunes of favored heroes in the\r\nlegends of ancient poetry. Raising a yell that spoke volumes of anger and\r\ndisappointment, the subtle chief, when he saw his comrades fallen, darted away\r\nfrom the place, attended by his two only surviving friends, leaving the\r\nDelawares engaged in stripping the dead of the bloody trophies of their\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nBut Uncas, who had vainly sought him in the melee, bounded forward in pursuit;\r\nHawkeye, Heyward and David still pressing on his footsteps. The utmost that the\r\nscout could effect, was to keep the muzzle of his rifle a little in advance of\r\nhis friend, to whom, however, it answered every purpose of a charmed shield.\r\nOnce Magua appeared disposed to make another and a final effort to revenge his\r\nlosses; but, abandoning his intention as soon as demonstrated, he leaped into a\r\nthicket of bushes, through which he was followed by his enemies, and suddenly\r\nentered the mouth of the cave already known to the reader. Hawkeye, who had\r\nonly forborne to fire in tenderness to Uncas, raised a shout of success, and\r\nproclaimed aloud that now they were certain of their game. The pursuers dashed\r\ninto the long and narrow entrance, in time to catch a glimpse of the retreating\r\nforms of the Hurons. Their passage through the natural galleries and\r\nsubterraneous apartments of the cavern was preceded by the shrieks and cries of\r\nhundreds of women and children. The place, seen by its dim and uncertain light,\r\nappeared like the shades of the infernal regions, across which unhappy ghosts\r\nand savage demons were flitting in multitudes.\r\n\r\nStill Uncas kept his eye on Magua, as if life to him possessed but a single\r\nobject. Heyward and the scout still pressed on his rear, actuated, though\r\npossibly in a less degree, by a common feeling. But their way was becoming\r\nintricate, in those dark and gloomy passages, and the glimpses of the retiring\r\nwarriors less distinct and frequent; and for a moment the trace was believed to\r\nbe lost, when a white robe was seen fluttering in the further extremity of a\r\npassage that seemed to lead up the mountain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis Cora!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Heyward, in a voice in which horror\r\nand delight were wildly mingled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCora! Cora!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Uncas, bounding forward like a deer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the maiden!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the scout. \xe2\x80\x9cCourage, lady;\r\nwe come! we come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chase was renewed with a diligence rendered tenfold encouraging by this\r\nglimpse of the captive. But the way was rugged, broken, and in spots nearly\r\nimpassable. Uncas abandoned his rifle, and leaped forward with headlong\r\nprecipitation. Heyward rashly imitated his example, though both were, a moment\r\nafterward, admonished of his madness by hearing the bellowing of a piece, that\r\nthe Hurons found time to discharge down the passage in the rocks, the bullet\r\nfrom which even gave the young Mohican a slight wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must close!\xe2\x80\x9d said the scout, passing his friends by a desperate\r\nleap; \xe2\x80\x9cthe knaves will pick us all off at this distance; and see, they\r\nhold the maiden so as to shield themselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough his words were unheeded, or rather unheard, his example was followed by\r\nhis companions, who, by incredible exertions, got near enough to the fugitives\r\nto perceive that Cora was borne along between the two warriors while Magua\r\nprescribed the direction and manner of their flight. At this moment the forms\r\nof all four were strongly drawn against an opening in the sky, and they\r\ndisappeared. Nearly frantic with disappointment, Uncas and Heyward increased\r\nefforts that already seemed superhuman, and they issued from the cavern on the\r\nside of the mountain, in time to note the route of the pursued. The course lay\r\nup the ascent, and still continued hazardous and laborious.\r\n\r\nEncumbered by his rifle, and, perhaps, not sustained by so deep an interest in\r\nthe captive as his companions, the scout suffered the latter to precede him a\r\nlittle, Uncas, in his turn, taking the lead of Heyward. In this manner, rocks,\r\nprecipices and difficulties were surmounted in an incredibly short space, that\r\nat another time, and under other circumstances, would have been deemed almost\r\ninsuperable. But the impetuous young men were rewarded by finding that,\r\nencumbered with Cora, the Hurons were losing ground in the race.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, dog of the Wyandots!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Uncas, shaking his bright\r\ntomahawk at Magua; \xe2\x80\x9ca Delaware girl calls stay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go no further!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cora, stopping unexpectedly on a\r\nledge of rock, that overhung a deep precipice, at no great distance from the\r\nsummit of the mountain. \xe2\x80\x9cKill me if thou wilt, detestable Huron; I will\r\ngo no further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the maiden raised their ready tomahawks with the impious joy\r\nthat fiends are thought to take in mischief, but Magua stayed the uplifted\r\narms. The Huron chief, after casting the weapons he had wrested from his\r\ncompanions over the rock, drew his knife, and turned to his captive, with a\r\nlook in which conflicting passions fiercely contended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cchose; the wigwam or the knife of Le\r\nSubtil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCora regarded him not, but dropping on her knees, she raised her eyes and\r\nstretched her arms toward heaven, saying in a meek and yet confiding voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thine; do with me as thou seest best!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Magua, hoarsely, and endeavoring in vain to catch\r\na glance from her serene and beaming eye, \xe2\x80\x9cchoose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Cora neither heard nor heeded his demand. The form of the Huron trembled in\r\nevery fibre, and he raised his arm on high, but dropped it again with a\r\nbewildered air, like one who doubted. Once more he struggled with himself and\r\nlifted the keen weapon again; but just then a piercing cry was heard above\r\nthem, and Uncas appeared, leaping frantically, from a fearful height, upon the\r\nledge. Magua recoiled a step; and one of his assistants, profiting by the\r\nchance, sheathed his own knife in the bosom of Cora.\r\n\r\nThe Huron sprang like a tiger on his offending and already retreating country\r\nman, but the falling form of Uncas separated the unnatural combatants. Diverted\r\nfrom his object by this interruption, and maddened by the murder he had just\r\nwitnessed, Magua buried his weapon in the back of the prostrate Delaware,\r\nuttering an unearthly shout as he committed the dastardly deed. But Uncas arose\r\nfrom the blow, as the wounded panther turns upon his foe, and struck the\r\nmurderer of Cora to his feet, by an effort in which the last of his failing\r\nstrength was expended. Then, with a stern and steady look, he turned to Le\r\nSubtil, and indicated by the expression of his eye all that he would do had not\r\nthe power deserted him. The latter seized the nerveless arm of the unresisting\r\nDelaware, and passed his knife into his bosom three several times, before his\r\nvictim, still keeping his gaze riveted on his enemy, with a look of\r\ninextinguishable scorn, fell dead at his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy! mercy! Huron,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Heyward, from above, in tones nearly\r\nchoked by horror; \xe2\x80\x9cgive mercy, and thou shalt receive from it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhirling the bloody knife up at the imploring youth, the victorious Magua\r\nuttered a cry so fierce, so wild, and yet so joyous, that it conveyed the\r\nsounds of savage triumph to the ears of those who fought in the valley, a\r\nthousand feet below. He was answered by a burst from the lips of the scout,\r\nwhose tall person was just then seen moving swiftly toward him, along those\r\ndangerous crags, with steps as bold and reckless as if he possessed the power\r\nto move in air. But when the hunter reached the scene of the ruthless massacre,\r\nthe ledge was tenanted only by the dead.\r\n\r\nHis keen eye took a single look at the victims, and then shot its glances over\r\nthe difficulties of the ascent in his front. A form stood at the brow of the\r\nmountain, on the very edge of the giddy height, with uplifted arms, in an awful\r\nattitude of menace. Without stopping to consider his person, the rifle of\r\nHawkeye was raised; but a rock, which fell on the head of one of the fugitives\r\nbelow, exposed the indignant and glowing countenance of the honest Gamut. Then\r\nMagua issued from a crevice, and, stepping with calm indifference over the body\r\nof the last of his associates, he leaped a wide fissure, and ascended the rocks\r\nat a point where the arm of David could not reach him. A single bound would\r\ncarry him to the brow of the precipice, and assure his safety. Before taking\r\nthe leap, however, the Huron paused, and shaking his hand at the scout, he\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pale faces are dogs! the Delawares women! Magua leaves them on the\r\nrocks, for the crows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaughing hoarsely, he made a desperate leap, and fell short of his mark, though\r\nhis hands grasped a shrub on the verge of the height. The form of Hawkeye had\r\ncrouched like a beast about to take its spring, and his frame trembled so\r\nviolently with eagerness that the muzzle of the half-raised rifle played like a\r\nleaf fluttering in the wind. Without exhausting himself with fruitless efforts,\r\nthe cunning Magua suffered his body to drop to the length of his arms, and\r\nfound a fragment for his feet to rest on. Then, summoning all his powers, he\r\nrenewed the attempt, and so far succeeded as to draw his knees on the edge of\r\nthe mountain. It was now, when the body of his enemy was most collected\r\ntogether, that the agitated weapon of the scout was drawn to his shoulder. The\r\nsurrounding rocks themselves were not steadier than the piece became, for the\r\nsingle instant that it poured out its contents. The arms of the Huron relaxed,\r\nand his body fell back a little, while his knees still kept their position.\r\nTurning a relentless look on his enemy, he shook a hand in grim defiance. But\r\nhis hold loosened, and his dark person was seen cutting the air with its head\r\ndownward, for a fleeting instant, until it glided past the fringe of shrubbery\r\nwhich clung to the mountain, in its rapid flight to destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey fought, like brave men, long and well,\r\nThey piled that ground with Moslem slain,\r\nThey conquered\xe2\x80\x94but Bozzaris fell,\r\nBleeding at every vein.\r\nHis few surviving comrades saw\r\nHis smile when rang their loud hurrah,\r\nAnd the red field was won;\r\nThen saw in death his eyelids close\r\nCalmly, as to a night\xe2\x80\x99s repose,\r\nLike flowers at set of sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Halleck.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun found the Lenape, on the succeeding day, a nation of mourners. The\r\nsounds of the battle were over, and they had fed fat their ancient grudge, and\r\nhad avenged their recent quarrel with the Mengwe, by the destruction of a whole\r\ncommunity. The black and murky atmosphere that floated around the spot where\r\nthe Hurons had encamped, sufficiently announced of itself, the fate of that\r\nwandering tribe; while hundreds of ravens, that struggled above the summits of\r\nthe mountains, or swept, in noisy flocks, across the wide ranges of the woods,\r\nfurnished a frightful direction to the scene of the combat. In short, any eye\r\nat all practised in the signs of a frontier warfare might easily have traced\r\nall those unerring evidences of the ruthless results which attend an Indian\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nStill, the sun rose on the Lenape a nation of mourners. No shouts of success,\r\nno songs of triumph, were heard, in rejoicings for their victory. The latest\r\nstraggler had returned from his fell employment, only to strip himself of the\r\nterrific emblems of his bloody calling, and to join in the lamentations of his\r\ncountrymen, as a stricken people. Pride and exultation were supplanted by\r\nhumility, and the fiercest of human passions was already succeeded by the most\r\nprofound and unequivocal demonstrations of grief.\r\n\r\nThe lodges were deserted; but a broad belt of earnest faces encircled a spot in\r\ntheir vicinity, whither everything possessing life had repaired, and where all\r\nwere now collected, in deep and awful silence. Though beings of every rank and\r\nage, of both sexes, and of all pursuits, had united to form this breathing wall\r\nof bodies, they were influenced by a single emotion. Each eye was riveted on\r\nthe center of that ring, which contained the objects of so much and of so\r\ncommon an interest.\r\n\r\nSix Delaware girls, with their long, dark, flowing tresses falling loosely\r\nacross their bosoms, stood apart, and only gave proof of their existence as\r\nthey occasionally strewed sweet-scented herbs and forest flowers on a litter of\r\nfragrant plants that, under a pall of Indian robes, supported all that now\r\nremained of the ardent, high-souled, and generous Cora. Her form was concealed\r\nin many wrappers of the same simple manufacture, and her face was shut forever\r\nfrom the gaze of men. At her feet was seated the desolate Munro. His aged head\r\nwas bowed nearly to the earth, in compelled submission to the stroke of\r\nProvidence; but a hidden anguish struggled about his furrowed brow, that was\r\nonly partially concealed by the careless locks of gray that had fallen,\r\nneglected, on his temples. Gamut stood at his side, his meek head bared to the\r\nrays of the sun, while his eyes, wandering and concerned, seemed to be equally\r\ndivided between that little volume, which contained so many quaint but holy\r\nmaxims, and the being in whose behalf his soul yearned to administer\r\nconsolation. Heyward was also nigh, supporting himself against a tree, and\r\nendeavoring to keep down those sudden risings of sorrow that it required his\r\nutmost manhood to subdue.\r\n\r\nBut sad and melancholy as this group may easily be imagined, it was far less\r\ntouching than another, that occupied the opposite space of the same area.\r\nSeated, as in life, with his form and limbs arranged in grave and decent\r\ncomposure, Uncas appeared, arrayed in the most gorgeous ornaments that the\r\nwealth of the tribe could furnish. Rich plumes nodded above his head; wampum,\r\ngorgets, bracelets, and medals, adorned his person in profusion; though his\r\ndull eye and vacant lineaments too strongly contradicted the idle tale of pride\r\nthey would convey.\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of the corpse Chingachgook was placed, without arms, paint or\r\nadornment of any sort, except the bright blue blazonry of his race, that was\r\nindelibly impressed on his naked bosom. During the long period that the tribe\r\nhad thus been collected, the Mohican warrior had kept a steady, anxious look on\r\nthe cold and senseless countenance of his son. So riveted and intense had been\r\nthat gaze, and so changeless his attitude, that a stranger might not have told\r\nthe living from the dead, but for the occasional gleamings of a troubled\r\nspirit, that shot athwart the dark visage of one, and the deathlike calm that\r\nhad forever settled on the lineaments of the other. The scout was hard by,\r\nleaning in a pensive posture on his own fatal and avenging weapon; while\r\nTamenund, supported by the elders of his nation, occupied a high place at hand,\r\nwhence he might look down on the mute and sorrowful assemblage of his people.\r\n\r\nJust within the inner edge of the circle stood a soldier, in the military\r\nattire of a strange nation; and without it was his warhorse, in the center of a\r\ncollection of mounted domestics, seemingly in readiness to undertake some\r\ndistant journey. The vestments of the stranger announced him to be one who held\r\na responsible situation near the person of the captain of the Canadas; and who,\r\nas it would now seem, finding his errand of peace frustrated by the fierce\r\nimpetuosity of his allies, was content to become a silent and sad spectator of\r\nthe fruits of a contest that he had arrived too late to anticipate.\r\n\r\nThe day was drawing to the close of its first quarter, and yet had the\r\nmultitude maintained its breathing stillness since its dawn.\r\n\r\nNo sound louder than a stifled sob had been heard among them, nor had even a\r\nlimb been moved throughout that long and painful period, except to perform the\r\nsimple and touching offerings that were made, from time to time, in\r\ncommemoration of the dead. The patience and forbearance of Indian fortitude\r\ncould alone support such an appearance of abstraction, as seemed now to have\r\nturned each dark and motionless figure into stone.\r\n\r\nAt length, the sage of the Delawares stretched forth an arm, and leaning on the\r\nshoulders of his attendants, he arose with an air as feeble as if another age\r\nhad already intervened between the man who had met his nation the preceding\r\nday, and him who now tottered on his elevated stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen of the Lenape!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in low, hollow tones, that sounded\r\nlike a voice charged with some prophetic mission: \xe2\x80\x9cthe face of the\r\nManitou is behind a cloud! His eye is turned from you; His ears are shut; His\r\ntongue gives no answer. You see him not; yet His judgments are before you. Let\r\nyour hearts be open and your spirits tell no lie. Men of the Lenape! the face\r\nof the Manitou is behind a cloud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs this simple and yet terrible annunciation stole on the ears of the\r\nmultitude, a stillness as deep and awful succeeded as if the venerated spirit\r\nthey worshiped had uttered the words without the aid of human organs; and even\r\nthe inanimate Uncas appeared a being of life, compared with the humbled and\r\nsubmissive throng by whom he was surrounded. As the immediate effect, however,\r\ngradually passed away, a low murmur of voices commenced a sort of chant in\r\nhonor of the dead. The sounds were those of females, and were thrillingly soft\r\nand wailing. The words were connected by no regular continuation, but as one\r\nceased another took up the eulogy, or lamentation, whichever it might be\r\ncalled, and gave vent to her emotions in such language as was suggested by her\r\nfeelings and the occasion. At intervals the speaker was interrupted by general\r\nand loud bursts of sorrow, during which the girls around the bier of Cora\r\nplucked the plants and flowers blindly from her body, as if bewildered with\r\ngrief. But, in the milder moments of their plaint, these emblems of purity and\r\nsweetness were cast back to their places, with every sign of tenderness and\r\nregret. Though rendered less connected by many and general interruptions and\r\noutbreakings, a translation of their language would have contained a regular\r\ndescant, which, in substance, might have proved to possess a train of\r\nconsecutive ideas.\r\n\r\nA girl, selected for the task by her rank and qualifications, commenced by\r\nmodest allusions to the qualities of the deceased warrior, embellishing her\r\nexpressions with those oriental images that the Indians have probably brought\r\nwith them from the extremes of the other continent, and which form of\r\nthemselves a link to connect the ancient histories of the two worlds. She\r\ncalled him the \xe2\x80\x9cpanther of his tribe\xe2\x80\x9d; and described him as one\r\nwhose moccasin left no trail on the dews; whose bound was like the leap of a\r\nyoung fawn; whose eye was brighter than a star in the dark night; and whose\r\nvoice, in battle, was loud as the thunder of the Manitou. She reminded him of\r\nthe mother who bore him, and dwelt forcibly on the happiness she must feel in\r\npossessing such a son. She bade him tell her, when they met in the world of\r\nspirits, that the Delaware girls had shed tears above the grave of her child,\r\nand had called her blessed.\r\n\r\nThen, they who succeeded, changing their tones to a milder and still more\r\ntender strain, alluded, with the delicacy and sensitiveness of women, to the\r\nstranger maiden, who had left the upper earth at a time so near his own\r\ndeparture, as to render the will of the Great Spirit too manifest to be\r\ndisregarded. They admonished him to be kind to her, and to have consideration\r\nfor her ignorance of those arts which were so necessary to the comfort of a\r\nwarrior like himself. They dwelled upon her matchless beauty, and on her noble\r\nresolution, without the taint of envy, and as angels may be thought to delight\r\nin a superior excellence; adding, that these endowments should prove more than\r\nequivalent for any little imperfection in her education.\r\n\r\nAfter which, others again, in due succession, spoke to the maiden herself, in\r\nthe low, soft language of tenderness and love. They exhorted her to be of\r\ncheerful mind, and to fear nothing for her future welfare. A hunter would be\r\nher companion, who knew how to provide for her smallest wants; and a warrior\r\nwas at her side who was able to protect he against every danger. They promised\r\nthat her path should be pleasant, and her burden light. They cautioned her\r\nagainst unavailing regrets for the friends of her youth, and the scenes where\r\nher father had dwelt; assuring her that the \xe2\x80\x9cblessed hunting grounds of\r\nthe Lenape,\xe2\x80\x9d contained vales as pleasant, streams as pure; and flowers as\r\nsweet, as the \xe2\x80\x9cheaven of the pale faces.\xe2\x80\x9d They advised her to be\r\nattentive to the wants of her companion, and never to forget the distinction\r\nwhich the Manitou had so wisely established between them. Then, in a wild burst\r\nof their chant they sang with united voices the temper of the Mohican\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind. They pronounced him noble, manly and generous; all that became a warrior,\r\nand all that a maid might love. Clothing their ideas in the most remote and\r\nsubtle images, they betrayed, that, in the short period of their intercourse,\r\nthey had discovered, with the intuitive perception of their sex, the truant\r\ndisposition of his inclinations. The Delaware girls had found no favor in his\r\neyes! He was of a race that had once been lords on the shores of the salt lake,\r\nand his wishes had led him back to a people who dwelt about the graves of his\r\nfathers. Why should not such a predilection be encouraged! That she was of a\r\nblood purer and richer than the rest of her nation, any eye might have seen;\r\nthat she was equal to the dangers and daring of a life in the woods, her\r\nconduct had proved; and now, they added, the \xe2\x80\x9cwise one of the\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x9d had transplanted her to a place where she would find congenial\r\nspirits, and might be forever happy.\r\n\r\nThen, with another transition in voice and subject, allusions were made to the\r\nvirgin who wept in the adjacent lodge. They compared her to flakes of snow; as\r\npure, as white, as brilliant, and as liable to melt in the fierce heats of\r\nsummer, or congeal in the frosts of winter. They doubted not that she was\r\nlovely in the eyes of the young chief, whose skin and whose sorrow seemed so\r\nlike her own; but though far from expressing such a preference, it was evident\r\nthey deemed her less excellent than the maid they mourned. Still they denied\r\nher no need her rare charms might properly claim. Her ringlets were compared to\r\nthe exuberant tendrils of the vine, her eye to the blue vault of heavens, and\r\nthe most spotless cloud, with its glowing flush of the sun, was admitted to be\r\nless attractive than her bloom.\r\n\r\nDuring these and similar songs nothing was audible but the murmurs of the\r\nmusic; relieved, as it was, or rather rendered terrible, by those occasional\r\nbursts of grief which might be called its choruses. The Delawares themselves\r\nlistened like charmed men; and it was very apparent, by the variations of their\r\nspeaking countenances, how deep and true was their sympathy. Even David was not\r\nreluctant to lend his ears to the tones of voices so sweet; and long ere the\r\nchant was ended, his gaze announced that his soul was enthralled.\r\n\r\nThe scout, to whom alone, of all the white men, the words were intelligible,\r\nsuffered himself to be a little aroused from his meditative posture, and bent\r\nhis face aside, to catch their meaning, as the girls proceeded. But when they\r\nspoke of the future prospects of Cora and Uncas, he shook his head, like one\r\nwho knew the error of their simple creed, and resuming his reclining attitude,\r\nhe maintained it until the ceremony, if that might be called a ceremony, in\r\nwhich feeling was so deeply imbued, was finished. Happily for the self-command\r\nof both Heyward and Munro, they knew not the meaning of the wild sounds they\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nChingachgook was a solitary exception to the interest manifested by the native\r\npart of the audience. His look never changed throughout the whole of the scene,\r\nnor did a muscle move in his rigid countenance, even at the wildest or the most\r\npathetic parts of the lamentation. The cold and senseless remains of his son\r\nwas all to him, and every other sense but that of sight seemed frozen, in order\r\nthat his eyes might take their final gaze at those lineaments he had so long\r\nloved, and which were now about to be closed forever from his view.\r\n\r\nIn this stage of the obsequies, a warrior much renowned for deed in arms, and\r\nmore especially for services in the recent combat, a man of stern and grave\r\ndemeanor, advanced slowly from the crowd, and placed himself nigh the person of\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy hast thou left us, pride of the Wapanachki?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\naddressing himself to the dull ears of Uncas, as if the empty clay retained the\r\nfaculties of the animated man; \xe2\x80\x9cthy time has been like that of the sun\r\nwhen in the trees; thy glory brighter than his light at noonday. Thou art gone,\r\nyouthful warrior, but a hundred Wyandots are clearing the briers from thy path\r\nto the world of the spirits. Who that saw thee in battle would believe that\r\nthou couldst die? Who before thee has ever shown Uttawa the way into the fight?\r\nThy feet were like the wings of eagles; thine arm heavier than falling branches\r\nfrom the pine; and thy voice like the Manitou when He speaks in the clouds. The\r\ntongue of Uttawa is weak,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking about him with a melancholy\r\ngaze, \xe2\x80\x9cand his heart exceeding heavy. Pride of the Wapanachki, why hast\r\nthou left us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by others, in due order, until most of the high and gifted men\r\nof the nation had sung or spoken their tribute of praise over the manes of the\r\ndeceased chief. When each had ended, another deep and breathing silence reigned\r\nin all the place.\r\n\r\nThen a low, deep sound was heard, like the suppressed accompaniment of distant\r\nmusic, rising just high enough on the air to be audible, and yet so\r\nindistinctly, as to leave its character, and the place whence it proceeded,\r\nalike matters of conjecture. It was, however, succeeded by another and another\r\nstrain, each in a higher key, until they grew on the ear, first in long drawn\r\nand often repeated interjections, and finally in words. The lips of\r\nChingachgook had so far parted, as to announce that it was the monody of the\r\nfather. Though not an eye was turned toward him nor the smallest sign of\r\nimpatience exhibited, it was apparent, by the manner in which the multitude\r\nelevated their heads to listen, that they drank in the sounds with an\r\nintenseness of attention, that none but Tamenund himself had ever before\r\ncommanded. But they listened in vain. The strains rose just so loud as to\r\nbecome intelligible, and then grew fainter and more trembling, until they\r\nfinally sank on the ear, as if borne away by a passing breath of wind. The lips\r\nof the Sagamore closed, and he remained silent in his seat, looking with his\r\nriveted eye and motionless form, like some creature that had been turned from\r\nthe Almighty hand with the form but without the spirit of a man. The Delawares\r\nwho knew by these symptoms that the mind of their friend was not prepared for\r\nso mighty an effort of fortitude, relaxed in their attention; and, with an\r\ninnate delicacy, seemed to bestow all their thoughts on the obsequies of the\r\nstranger maiden.\r\n\r\nA signal was given, by one of the elder chiefs, to the women who crowded that\r\npart of the circle near which the body of Cora lay. Obedient to the sign, the\r\ngirls raised the bier to the elevation of their heads, and advanced with slow\r\nand regulated steps, chanting, as they proceeded, another wailing song in\r\npraise of the deceased. Gamut, who had been a close observer of rites he deemed\r\nso heathenish, now bent his head over the shoulder of the unconscious father,\r\nwhispering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey move with the remains of thy child; shall we not follow, and see\r\nthem interred with Christian burial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMunro started, as if the last trumpet had sounded in his ear, and bestowing one\r\nanxious and hurried glance around him, he arose and followed in the simple\r\ntrain, with the mien of a soldier, but bearing the full burden of a\r\nparent\xe2\x80\x99s suffering. His friends pressed around him with a sorrow that was\r\ntoo strong to be termed sympathy\xe2\x80\x94even the young Frenchman joining in the\r\nprocession, with the air of a man who was sensibly touched at the early and\r\nmelancholy fate of one so lovely. But when the last and humblest female of the\r\ntribe had joined in the wild and yet ordered array, the men of the Lenape\r\ncontracted their circle, and formed again around the person of Uncas, as\r\nsilent, as grave, and as motionless as before.\r\n\r\nThe place which had been chosen for the grave of Cora was a little knoll, where\r\na cluster of young and healthful pines had taken root, forming of themselves a\r\nmelancholy and appropriate shade over the spot. On reaching it the girls\r\ndeposited their burden, and continued for many minutes waiting, with\r\ncharacteristic patience, and native timidity, for some evidence that they whose\r\nfeelings were most concerned were content with the arrangement. At length the\r\nscout, who alone understood their habits, said, in their own language:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughters have done well; the white men thank them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this testimony in their favor, the girls proceeded to deposit\r\nthe body in a shell, ingeniously, and not inelegantly, fabricated of the bark\r\nof the birch; after which they lowered it into its dark and final abode. The\r\nceremony of covering the remains, and concealing the marks of the fresh earth,\r\nby leaves and other natural and customary objects, was conducted with the same\r\nsimple and silent forms. But when the labors of the kind beings who had\r\nperformed these sad and friendly offices were so far completed, they hesitated,\r\nin a way to show that they knew not how much further they might proceed. It was\r\nin this stage of the rites that the scout again addressed them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young women have done enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9cthe spirit of\r\nthe pale face has no need of food or raiment, their gifts being according to\r\nthe heaven of their color. I see,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, glancing an eye at David,\r\nwho was preparing his book in a manner that indicated an intention to lead the\r\nway in sacred song, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one who better knows the Christian fashions is\r\nabout to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe females stood modestly aside, and, from having been the principal actors in\r\nthe scene, they now became the meek and attentive observers of that which\r\nfollowed. During the time David occupied in pouring out the pious feelings of\r\nhis spirit in this manner, not a sign of surprise, nor a look of impatience,\r\nescaped them. They listened like those who knew the meaning of the strange\r\nwords, and appeared as if they felt the mingled emotions of sorrow, hope, and\r\nresignation, they were intended to convey.\r\n\r\nExcited by the scene he had just witnessed, and perhaps influenced by his own\r\nsecret emotions, the master of song exceeded his usual efforts. His full rich\r\nvoice was not found to suffer by a comparison with the soft tones of the girls;\r\nand his more modulated strains possessed, at least for the ears of those to\r\nwhom they were peculiarly addressed, the additional power of intelligence. He\r\nended the anthem, as he had commenced it, in the midst of a grave and solemn\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the closing cadence had fallen on the ears of his auditors, the\r\nsecret, timorous glances of the eyes, and the general and yet subdued movement\r\nof the assemblage, betrayed that something was expected from the father of the\r\ndeceased. Munro seemed sensible that the time was come for him to exert what\r\nis, perhaps, the greatest effort of which human nature is capable. He bared his\r\ngray locks, and looked around the timid and quiet throng by which he was\r\nencircled, with a firm and collected countenance. Then, motioning with his hand\r\nfor the scout to listen, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay to these kind and gentle females, that a heart-broken and failing\r\nman returns them his thanks. Tell them, that the Being we all worship, under\r\ndifferent names, will be mindful of their charity; and that the time shall not\r\nbe distant when we may assemble around His throne without distinction of sex,\r\nor rank, or color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout listened to the tremulous voice in which the veteran delivered these\r\nwords, and shook his head slowly when they were ended, as one who doubted their\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell them this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be to tell them that the\r\nsnows come not in the winter, or that the sun shines fiercest when the trees\r\nare stripped of their leaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen turning to the women, he made such a communication of the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngratitude as he deemed most suited to the capacities of his listeners. The head\r\nof Munro had already sunk upon his chest, and he was again fast relapsing into\r\nmelancholy, when the young Frenchman before named ventured to touch him lightly\r\non the elbow. As soon as he had gained the attention of the mourning old man,\r\nhe pointed toward a group of young Indians, who approached with a light but\r\nclosely covered litter, and then pointed upward toward the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Munro, with a voice of forced\r\nfirmness; \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you. It is the will of Heaven, and I submit.\r\nCora, my child! if the prayers of a heart-broken father could avail thee now,\r\nhow blessed shouldst thou be! Come, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking about\r\nhim with an air of lofty composure, though the anguish that quivered in his\r\nfaded countenance was far too powerful to be concealed, \xe2\x80\x9cour duty here is\r\nended; let us depart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeyward gladly obeyed a summons that took them from a spot where, each instant,\r\nhe felt his self-control was about to desert him. While his companions were\r\nmounting, however, he found time to press the hand of the scout, and to repeat\r\nthe terms of an engagement they had made to meet again within the posts of the\r\nBritish army. Then, gladly throwing himself into the saddle, he spurred his\r\ncharger to the side of the litter, whence low and stifled sobs alone announced\r\nthe presence of Alice. In this manner, the head of Munro again drooping on his\r\nbosom, with Heyward and David following in sorrowing silence, and attended by\r\nthe aide of Montcalm with his guard, all the white men, with the exception of\r\nHawkeye, passed from before the eyes of the Delawares, and were buried in the\r\nvast forests of that region.\r\n\r\nBut the tie which, through their common calamity, had united the feelings of\r\nthese simple dwellers in the woods with the strangers who had thus transiently\r\nvisited them, was not so easily broken. Years passed away before the\r\ntraditionary tale of the white maiden, and of the young warrior of the Mohicans\r\nceased to beguile the long nights and tedious marches, or to animate their\r\nyouthful and brave with a desire for vengeance. Neither were the secondary\r\nactors in these momentous incidents forgotten. Through the medium of the scout,\r\nwho served for years afterward as a link between them and civilized life, they\r\nlearned, in answer to their inquiries, that the \xe2\x80\x9cGray Head\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nspeedily gathered to his fathers\xe2\x80\x94borne down, as was erroneously believed,\r\nby his military misfortunes; and that the \xe2\x80\x9cOpen Hand\xe2\x80\x9d had conveyed\r\nhis surviving daughter far into the settlements of the pale faces, where her\r\ntears had at last ceased to flow, and had been succeeded by the bright smiles\r\nwhich were better suited to her joyous nature.\r\n\r\nBut these were events of a time later than that which concerns our tale.\r\nDeserted by all of his color, Hawkeye returned to the spot where his sympathies\r\nled him, with a force that no ideal bond of union could destroy. He was just in\r\ntime to catch a parting look of the features of Uncas, whom the Delawares were\r\nalready inclosing in his last vestment of skins. They paused to permit the\r\nlonging and lingering gaze of the sturdy woodsman, and when it was ended, the\r\nbody was enveloped, never to be unclosed again. Then came a procession like the\r\nother, and the whole nation was collected about the temporary grave of the\r\nchief\xe2\x80\x94temporary, because it was proper that, at some future day, his\r\nbones should rest among those of his own people.\r\n\r\nThe movement, like the feeling, had been simultaneous and general. The same\r\ngrave expression of grief, the same rigid silence, and the same deference to\r\nthe principal mourner, were observed around the place of interment as have been\r\nalready described. The body was deposited in an attitude of repose, facing the\r\nrising sun, with the implements of war and of the chase at hand, in readiness\r\nfor the final journey. An opening was left in the shell, by which it was\r\nprotected from the soil, for the spirit to communicate with its earthly\r\ntenement, when necessary; and the whole was concealed from the instinct, and\r\nprotected from the ravages of the beasts of prey, with an ingenuity peculiar to\r\nthe natives. The manual rites then ceased and all present reverted to the more\r\nspiritual part of the ceremonies.\r\n\r\nChingachgook became once more the object of the common attention. He had not\r\nyet spoken, and something consolatory and instructive was expected from so\r\nrenowned a chief on an occasion of such interest. Conscious of the wishes of\r\nthe people, the stern and self-restrained warrior raised his face, which had\r\nlatterly been buried in his robe, and looked about him with a steady eye. His\r\nfirmly compressed and expressive lips then severed, and for the first time\r\nduring the long ceremonies his voice was distinctly audible. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do my\r\nbrothers mourn?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, regarding the dark race of dejected warriors by\r\nwhom he was environed; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do my daughters weep? that a young man has\r\ngone to the happy hunting-grounds; that a chief has filled his time with honor?\r\nHe was good; he was dutiful; he was brave. Who can deny it? The Manitou had\r\nneed of such a warrior, and He has called him away. As for me, the son and the\r\nfather of Uncas, I am a blazed pine, in a clearing of the pale faces. My race\r\nhas gone from the shores of the salt lake and the hills of the Delawares. But\r\nwho can say that the serpent of his tribe has forgotten his wisdom? I am\r\nalone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hawkeye, who had been gazing with a yearning look\r\nat the rigid features of his friend, with something like his own self-command,\r\nbut whose philosophy could endure no longer; \xe2\x80\x9cno, Sagamore, not alone.\r\nThe gifts of our colors may be different, but God has so placed us as to\r\njourney in the same path. I have no kin, and I may also say, like you, no\r\npeople. He was your son, and a red-skin by nature; and it may be that your\r\nblood was nearer\xe2\x80\x94but, if ever I forget the lad who has so often\r\nfou\xe2\x80\x99t at my side in war, and slept at my side in peace, may He who made\r\nus all, whatever may be our color or our gifts, forget me! The boy has left us\r\nfor a time; but, Sagamore, you are not alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nChingachgook grasped the hand that, in the warmth of feeling, the scout had\r\nstretched across the fresh earth, and in an attitude of friendship these two\r\nsturdy and intrepid woodsmen bowed their heads together, while scalding tears\r\nfell to their feet, watering the grave of Uncas like drops of falling rain.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the awful stillness with which such a burst of feeling, coming\r\nas it did, from the two most renowned warriors of that region, was received,\r\nTamenund lifted his voice to disperse the multitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, children of the Lenape, the\r\nanger of the Manitou is not done. Why should Tamenund stay? The pale faces are\r\nmasters of the earth, and the time of the red men has not yet come again. My\r\nday has been too long. In the morning I saw the sons of Unamis happy and\r\nstrong; and yet, before the night has come, have I lived to see the last\r\nwarrior of the wise race of the Mohicans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 940-0.txt or 940-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/9/4/940/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
