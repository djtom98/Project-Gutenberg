G., Chief of Ordnance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the Missouri negro\r\ndialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the\r\nordinary \xe2\x80\x9cPike County\xe2\x80\x9d dialect; and four modified varieties of this\r\nlast. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by\r\nguesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and\r\nsupport of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.\r\n\r\nI make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers\r\nwould suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and\r\nnot succeeding.\r\n\r\n   The Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUCKLEBERRY FINN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know about me without you have read a book by the name of\r\n_The Adventures of Tom Sawyer;_ but that ain\xe2\x80\x99t no matter. That book was\r\nmade by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things\r\nwhich he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I\r\nnever seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\r\nPolly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly\xe2\x80\x94Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Aunt Polly, she\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book,\r\nwhich is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\r\n\r\nNow the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the\r\nmoney that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got\r\nsix thousand dollars apiece\xe2\x80\x94all gold. It was an awful sight of money\r\nwhen it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\r\nat interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\r\nround\xe2\x80\x94more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas\r\nshe took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\r\nrough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\r\nand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nit no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\r\nagain, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\r\nsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\r\nwould go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\r\n\r\nThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\r\ncalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.\r\nShe put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do nothing but\r\nsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing\r\ncommenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\r\nto time. When you got to the table you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go right to eating,\r\nbut you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble\r\na little over the victuals, though there warn\xe2\x80\x99t really anything the\r\nmatter with them\xe2\x80\x94that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.\r\nIn a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and\r\nthe juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\r\n\r\nAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\r\nBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\r\nby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\r\nthen I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care no more about him, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t take no stock in\r\ndead people.\r\n\r\nPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clean, and I must\r\ntry to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They\r\nget down on a thing when they don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing about it. Here she\r\nwas a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to\r\nanybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for\r\ndoing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of\r\ncourse that was all right, because she done it herself.\r\n\r\nHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles\r\non, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\r\nspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\r\nthe widow made her ease up. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stood it much longer. Then for\r\nan hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put your feet up there, Huckleberry\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t scrunch up like\r\nthat, Huckleberry\xe2\x80\x94set up straight\xe2\x80\x9d; and pretty soon she would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry\xe2\x80\x94why don\xe2\x80\x99t you try to\r\nbehave?\xe2\x80\x9d Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\r\nI was there. She got mad then, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm. All I wanted\r\nwas to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\xe2\x80\x99t particular.\r\nShe said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it for\r\nthe whole world; _she_ was going to live so as to go to the good place.\r\nWell, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\r\nmade up my mind I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try for it. But I never said so, because it\r\nwould only make trouble, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good.\r\n\r\nNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\r\nplace. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\r\nday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think much\r\nof it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\r\nwould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad\r\nabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\r\n\r\nMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\r\nBy and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\r\neverybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\r\nand put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and\r\ntried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use. I felt so\r\nlonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the\r\nleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\r\noff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and\r\na dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was\r\ntrying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out what it was,\r\nand so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods\r\nI heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell\r\nabout something that\xe2\x80\x99s on its mind and can\xe2\x80\x99t make itself understood,\r\nand so can\xe2\x80\x99t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way\r\nevery night grieving. I got so downhearted and scared I did wish I had\r\nsome company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\r\nflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\r\nwas all shriveled up. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need anybody to tell me that that was\r\nan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\r\nand most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\r\ntracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\r\nup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t no confidence. You do that when you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a horseshoe that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nheard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\xe2\x80\x99d killed\r\na spider.\r\n\r\nI set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\r\nfor the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\r\ngo boom\xe2\x80\x94boom\xe2\x80\x94boom\xe2\x80\x94twelve licks; and all still again\xe2\x80\x94stiller than\r\never. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\r\ntrees\xe2\x80\x94something was a-stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I\r\ncould just barely hear a \xe2\x80\x9c_me-yow! me-yow!_\xe2\x80\x9d down there. That was good!\r\nSays I, \xe2\x80\x9c_me-yow! me-yow!_\xe2\x80\x9d as soft as I could, and then I put out the\r\nlight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped\r\ndown to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\r\nthere was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back toward the end\r\nof the widow\xe2\x80\x99s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nscrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a\r\nroot and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbig nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see\r\nhim pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and\r\nstretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho dah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe listened some more; then he came tiptoeing down and stood right\r\nbetween us; we could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was\r\nminutes and minutes that there warn\xe2\x80\x99t a sound, and we all there so\r\nclose together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but\r\nI dasn\xe2\x80\x99t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\r\nright between my shoulders. Seemed like I\xe2\x80\x99d die if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t scratch.\r\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the\r\nquality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsleepy\xe2\x80\x94if you are anywheres where it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for you to scratch, why\r\nyou will itch all over in upward of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn\xe2\x80\x99 hear sumf\xe2\x80\x99n.\r\nWell, I know what I\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to do: I\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to set down here and\r\nlisten tell I hears it ag\xe2\x80\x99in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back\r\nup against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most\r\ntouched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears\r\ncome into my eyes. But I dasn\xe2\x80\x99t scratch. Then it begun to itch on\r\nthe inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\r\nwas going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or\r\nseven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching\r\nin eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it more\xe2\x80\x99n\r\na minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just\r\nthen Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore\xe2\x80\x94and then I was\r\npretty soon comfortable again.\r\n\r\nTom he made a sign to me\xe2\x80\x94kind of a little noise with his mouth\xe2\x80\x94and we\r\nwent creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off\r\nTom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I\r\nsaid no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they\xe2\x80\x99d find out\r\nI warn\xe2\x80\x99t in. Then Tom said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got candles enough, and he would\r\nslip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to try. I said\r\nJim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in\r\nthere and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for\r\npay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing\r\nwould do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and\r\nknees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while,\r\neverything was so still and lonesome.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\r\nand by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side\r\nof the house. Tom said he slipped Jim\xe2\x80\x99s hat off of his head and hung\r\nit on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwake. Afterward Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a\r\ntrance, and rode him all over the state, and then set him under the\r\ntrees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next\r\ntime Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after\r\nthat, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by\r\nhe said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death,\r\nand his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about\r\nit, and he got so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers\r\nwould come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up\r\nto than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with\r\ntheir mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.\r\nNiggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen\r\nfire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about\r\nsuch things, Jim would happen in and say, \xe2\x80\x9cHm! What you know \xe2\x80\x99bout\r\nwitches?\xe2\x80\x9d and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.\r\nJim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string,\r\nand said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and\r\ntold him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he\r\nwanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was\r\nhe said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim\r\nanything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was\r\nmost ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having\r\nseen the devil and been rode by witches.\r\n\r\nWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away\r\ndown into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling,\r\nwhere there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling\r\never so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile\r\nbroad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Joe\r\nHarper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the\r\nold tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile\r\nand a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\r\n\r\nWe went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\r\nsecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\r\npart of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\r\nhands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\r\nopened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\r\nunder a wall where you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 noticed that there was a hole. We\r\nwent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\r\nsweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s Gang.\r\nEverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his\r\nname in blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\r\nwrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the\r\nband, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything\r\nto any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person\r\nand his family must do it, and he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t eat and he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep\r\ntill he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was\r\nthe sign of the band. And nobody that didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to the band could\r\nuse that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again\r\nhe must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the\r\nsecrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt\r\nup and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off the\r\nlist with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse\r\nput on it and be forgot forever.\r\n\r\nEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\r\nit out of his own head. He said some of it, but the rest was out of\r\npirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSome thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\r\nthe secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\r\nit in. Then Ben Rogers says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Huck Finn, he hain\xe2\x80\x99t got no family; what you going to do \xe2\x80\x99bout\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, hain\xe2\x80\x99t he got a father?\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom Sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a father, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t never find him these days. He\r\nused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain\xe2\x80\x99t been seen\r\nin these parts for a year or more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\r\nsaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of\r\nanything to do\xe2\x80\x94everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready\r\nto cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\r\nWatson\xe2\x80\x94they could kill her. Everybody said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99ll do. That\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Huck can come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\r\nand I made my mark on the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ben Rogers, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the line of business of this Gang?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing only robbery and murder,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who are we going to rob?\xe2\x80\x94houses, or cattle, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff! stealing cattle and such things ain\xe2\x80\x99t robbery; it\xe2\x80\x99s burglary,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays Tom Sawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ain\xe2\x80\x99t burglars. That ain\xe2\x80\x99t no sort of style. We\r\nare highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\r\non, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust we always kill the people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly. It\xe2\x80\x99s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s considered best to kill them\xe2\x80\x94except some that you bring to the\r\ncave here, and keep them till they\xe2\x80\x99re ransomed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRansomed? What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what they do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in books; and so\r\nof course that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can we do it if we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, blame it all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve _got_ to do it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nbooks? Do you want to go to doing different from what\xe2\x80\x99s in the books,\r\nand get things all muddled up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation\r\nare these fellows going to be ransomed if we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do it to\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing _I_ want to get at. Now, what do you _reckon_ it\r\nis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But per\xe2\x80\x99aps if we keep them till they\xe2\x80\x99re ransomed,\r\nit means that we keep them till they\xe2\x80\x99re dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s something _like._ That\xe2\x80\x99ll answer. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you said\r\nthat before? We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep them till they\xe2\x80\x99re ransomed to death; and a\r\nbothersome lot they\xe2\x80\x99ll be, too\xe2\x80\x94eating up everything, and always trying\r\nto get loose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there\xe2\x80\x99s a guard\r\nover them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA guard! Well, that _is_ good. So somebody\xe2\x80\x99s got to set up all night\r\nand never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfoolishness. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as\r\nthey get here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it ain\xe2\x80\x99t in the books so\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you\r\nwant to do things regular, or don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nreckon that the people that made the books knows what\xe2\x80\x99s the correct\r\nthing to do? Do you reckon _you_ can learn \xe2\x80\x99em anything? Not by a good\r\ndeal. No, sir, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind; but I say it\xe2\x80\x99s a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we\r\nkill the women, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let on. Kill\r\nthe women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You\r\nfetch them to the cave, and you\xe2\x80\x99re always as polite as pie to them; and\r\nby and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the way I\xe2\x80\x99m agreed, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t take no stock in it.\r\nMighty soon we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows\r\nwaiting to be ransomed, that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be no place for the robbers.\r\nBut go ahead, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got nothing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was\r\nscared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to be a robber any more.\r\n\r\nSo they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him\r\nmad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But Tom\r\ngive him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and\r\nmeet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.\r\n\r\nBen Rogers said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out much, only Sundays, and so he\r\nwanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked\r\nto do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get\r\ntogether and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom\r\nSawyer first captain and Joe Harper second captain of the Gang, and so\r\nstarted home.\r\n\r\nI clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was\r\nbreaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was\r\ndog-tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on\r\naccount of my clothes; but the widow she didn\xe2\x80\x99t scold, but only cleaned\r\noff the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would\r\nbehave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet\r\nand prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day,\r\nand whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t so. I tried\r\nit. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t any good to me\r\nwithout hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it work. By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to\r\ntry for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out no way.\r\n\r\nI set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.\r\nI says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nDeacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t the widow get\r\nback her silver snuff-box that was stole? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Watson fat up?\r\nNo, says I to myself, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing in it. I went and told the\r\nwidow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for\r\nit was \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual gifts.\xe2\x80\x9d This was too many for me, but she told me\r\nwhat she meant\xe2\x80\x94I must help other people, and do everything I could for\r\nother people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about\r\nmyself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the\r\nwoods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no\r\nadvantage about it\xe2\x80\x94except for the other people; so at last I reckoned\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the\r\nwidow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make\r\na body\xe2\x80\x99s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold\r\nand knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two\r\nProvidences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s Providence, but if Miss Watson\xe2\x80\x99s got him there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no help\r\nfor him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong\r\nto the widow\xe2\x80\x99s if he wanted me, though I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out how he was\r\na-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was\r\nso ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.\r\n\r\nPap he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable\r\nfor me; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see him no more. He used to always whale me\r\nwhen he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take\r\nto the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time\r\nhe was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so\r\npeople said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man\r\nwas just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which\r\nwas all like pap; but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make nothing out of the face,\r\nbecause it had been in the water so long it warn\xe2\x80\x99t much like a face at\r\nall. They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him\r\nand buried him on the bank. But I warn\xe2\x80\x99t comfortable long, because I\r\nhappened to think of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded\r\nman don\xe2\x80\x99t float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that\r\nthis warn\xe2\x80\x99t pap, but a woman dressed up in a man\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. So I was\r\nuncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again by and\r\nby, though I wished he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nWe played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All\r\nthe boys did. We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t robbed nobody, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t killed any people, but\r\nonly just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging\r\ndown on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,\r\nbut we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs \xe2\x80\x9cingots,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he called the turnips and stuff \xe2\x80\x9cjulery,\xe2\x80\x9d and we would go to the\r\ncave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had\r\nkilled and marked. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no profit in it. One time Tom\r\nsent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a\r\nslogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then\r\nhe said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole\r\nparcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave\r\nHollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over\r\na thousand \xe2\x80\x9csumter\xe2\x80\x9d mules, all loaded down with di\xe2\x80\x99monds, and they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay\r\nin ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.\r\nHe said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never\r\ncould go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns\r\nall scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and\r\nyou might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn\xe2\x80\x99t worth a\r\nmouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\r\ncould lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see\r\nthe camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the\r\nambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down\r\nthe hill. But there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno camels nor no elephants. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t anything but a Sunday-school\r\npicnic, and only a primer class at that. We busted it up, and chased\r\nthe children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some\r\ndoughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Joe Harper\r\ngot a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made\r\nus drop everything and cut. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see no di\xe2\x80\x99monds, and I told Tom\r\nSawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said\r\nthere was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we see them, then? He said if I warn\xe2\x80\x99t so ignorant, but had\r\nread a book called _Don Quixote_, I would know without asking. He said\r\nit was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers\r\nthere, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which\r\nhe called magicians, and they had turned the whole thing into an infant\r\nSunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for\r\nus to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ca magician could call up a lot of genies, and they\r\nwould hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. They\r\nare as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x99pose we got some genies to help _us_\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t we lick\r\nthe other crowd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you going to get them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. How do _they_ get them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies\r\ncome tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and\r\nthe smoke a-rolling, and everything they\xe2\x80\x99re told to do they up and do\r\nit. They don\xe2\x80\x99t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots,\r\nand belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it\xe2\x80\x94or any\r\nother man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho makes them tear around so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs\r\nthe lamp or the ring, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do whatever he says. If he\r\ntells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di\xe2\x80\x99monds, and fill\r\nit full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter from China for you to marry, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do it\xe2\x80\x94and they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to do it before sun-up next morning, too. And more: they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nwaltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cI think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping\r\nthe palace themselves \xe2\x80\x99stead of fooling them away like that. And what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would\r\ndrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you\xe2\x80\x99d _have_ to come when he rubbed it,\r\nwhether you wanted to or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right, then;\r\nI _would_ come; but I lay I\xe2\x80\x99d make that man climb the highest tree\r\nthere was in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to\r\nknow anything, somehow\xe2\x80\x94perfect saphead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I\r\nwould see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an\r\niron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat\r\nlike an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff\r\nwas only just one of Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s lies. I reckoned he believed in the\r\nA-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had all\r\nthe marks of a Sunday-school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter\r\nnow. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read\r\nand write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to\r\nsix times seven is thirty-five, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon I could ever get any\r\nfurther than that if I was to live forever. I don\xe2\x80\x99t take no stock in\r\nmathematics, anyway.\r\n\r\nAt first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand\r\nit. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I\r\ngot next day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to\r\nschool the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s ways, too, and they warn\xe2\x80\x99t so raspy on me. Living in a house\r\nand sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the\r\ncold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and\r\nso that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting\r\nso I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming\r\nalong slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nashamed of me.\r\n\r\nOne morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.\r\nI reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left\r\nshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of\r\nme, and crossed me off. She says, \xe2\x80\x9cTake your hands away, Huckleberry;\r\nwhat a mess you are always making!\xe2\x80\x9d The widow put in a good word for\r\nme, but that warn\xe2\x80\x99t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well\r\nenough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and\r\nwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to\r\nbe. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\none of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along\r\nlow-spirited and on the watch-out.\r\n\r\nI went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go\r\nthrough the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the\r\nground, and I seen somebody\xe2\x80\x99s tracks. They had come up from the quarry\r\nand stood around the stile awhile, and then went on around the garden\r\nfence. It was funny they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come in, after standing around so. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to\r\nfollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnotice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the left\r\nboot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.\r\n\r\nI was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my\r\nshoulder every now and then, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see nobody. I was at Judge\r\nThatcher\xe2\x80\x99s as quick as I could get there. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your\r\ninterest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cis there some for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night\xe2\x80\x94over a hundred and fifty\r\ndollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me invest it along\r\nwith your six thousand, because if you take it you\xe2\x80\x99ll spend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it at\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94nor the six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I want to give\r\nit to you\xe2\x80\x94the six thousand and all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked surprised. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make it out. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what can you mean, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ask me no questions about it, please. You\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m puzzled. Is something the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease take it,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me nothing\xe2\x80\x94then I won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nto tell no lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe studied awhile, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho-o! I think I see. You want to _sell_ all your property to me\xe2\x80\x94not\r\ngive it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the correct idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere; you see it says \xe2\x80\x98for a consideration.\xe2\x80\x99 That means I have bought\r\nit of you and paid you for it. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a dollar for you. Now you sign\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I signed it, and left.\r\n\r\nMiss Watson\xe2\x80\x99s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which\r\nhad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do\r\nmagic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed\r\neverything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here\r\nagain, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know\r\nwas, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got out\r\nhis hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and\r\ndropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about\r\nan inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just\r\nthe same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and\r\nlistened. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use; he said it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk. He said\r\nsometimes it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk without money. I told him I had an old\r\nslick counterfeit quarter that warn\xe2\x80\x99t no good because the brass showed\r\nthrough the silver a little, and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass nohow, even if the\r\nbrass didn\xe2\x80\x99t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that\r\nwould tell on it every time. (I reckoned I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing about\r\nthe dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but\r\nmaybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know the\r\ndifference. Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would\r\nmanage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would split\r\nopen a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it\r\nthere all night, and next morning you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no brass, and it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in\r\na minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that\r\nbefore, but I had forgot it.\r\n\r\nJim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened\r\nagain. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it\r\nwould tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the\r\nhair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYo\xe2\x80\x99 ole father doan\xe2\x80\x99 know yit what he\xe2\x80\x99s a-gwyne to do. Sometimes he\r\nspec he\xe2\x80\x99ll go \xe2\x80\x99way, en den ag\xe2\x80\x99in he spec he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay. De bes\xe2\x80\x99 way is to\r\nres\xe2\x80\x99 easy en let de ole man take his own way. Dey\xe2\x80\x99s two angels hoverin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nroun\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout him.

One is rich en t\xe2\x80\x99other is po\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to marry de po\xe2\x80\x99 one fust en de rich one by en by. You wants\r\nto keep \xe2\x80\x99way fum de water as much as you kin, en don\xe2\x80\x99t run no resk,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99kase it\xe2\x80\x99s down in de bills dat you\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to git hung.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat\r\npap\xe2\x80\x94his own self!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nI had shut the door to. Then I turned around, and there he was. I used\r\nto be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I\r\nwas scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken\xe2\x80\x94that is,\r\nafter the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched,\r\nhe being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn\xe2\x80\x99t scared of\r\nhim worth bothring about.\r\n\r\nHe was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled\r\nand greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through\r\nlike he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long,\r\nmixed-up whiskers. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t no color in his face, where his face\r\nshowed; it was white; not like another man\xe2\x80\x99s white, but a white to make\r\na body sick, a white to make a body\xe2\x80\x99s flesh crawl\xe2\x80\x94a tree-toad white, a\r\nfish-belly white. As for his clothes\xe2\x80\x94just rags, that was all. He had\r\none ankle resting on t\xe2\x80\x99other knee; the boot on that foot was busted,\r\nand two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then. His\r\nhat was laying on the floor\xe2\x80\x94an old black slouch with the top caved in,\r\nlike a lid.\r\n\r\nI stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair\r\ntilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the window was\r\nup; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me all over. By\r\nand by he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStarchy clothes\xe2\x80\x94very. You think you\xe2\x80\x99re a good deal of a big-bug,\r\n_don\xe2\x80\x99t_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I am, maybe I ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you give me none o\xe2\x80\x99 your lip,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve put on\r\nconsiderable many frills since I been away. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you down a peg\r\nbefore I get done with you. You\xe2\x80\x99re educated, too, they say\xe2\x80\x94can read and\r\nwrite. You think you\xe2\x80\x99re better\xe2\x80\x99n your father, now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, because\r\nhe can\xe2\x80\x99t? _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ take it out of you. Who told you you might meddle with\r\nsuch hifalut\xe2\x80\x99n foolishness, hey?\xe2\x80\x94who told you you could?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe widow. She told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe widow, hey?\xe2\x80\x94and who told the widow she could put in her shovel\r\nabout a thing that ain\xe2\x80\x99t none of her business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody never told her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn her how to meddle. And looky here\xe2\x80\x94you drop that\r\nschool, you hear? I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs\r\nover his own father and let on to be better\xe2\x80\x99n what _he_ is. You lemme\r\ncatch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your mother\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write, nuther, before she died. None\r\nof the family couldn\xe2\x80\x99t before _they_ died. _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t; and here you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na-swelling yourself up like this. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t the man to stand it\xe2\x80\x94you hear?\r\nSay, lemme hear you read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the\r\nwars. When I\xe2\x80\x99d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack\r\nwith his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. Now looky\r\nhere; you stop that putting on frills. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay for\r\nyou, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I\xe2\x80\x99ll tan you good.\r\nFirst you know you\xe2\x80\x99ll get religion, too. I never see such a son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something they give me for learning my lessons good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tore it up, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you something better\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a cowhide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes; and\r\na look\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor\xe2\x80\x94and your own father\r\ngot to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such a son. I\r\nbet I\xe2\x80\x99ll take some o\xe2\x80\x99 these frills out o\xe2\x80\x99 you before I\xe2\x80\x99m done with you.\r\nWhy, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no end to your airs\xe2\x80\x94they say you\xe2\x80\x99re rich. Hey?\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey lie\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here\xe2\x80\x94mind how you talk to me; I\xe2\x80\x99m a-standing about all I can\r\nstand now\xe2\x80\x94so don\xe2\x80\x99t gimme no sass. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in town two days, and\r\nI hain\xe2\x80\x99t heard nothing but about you bein\xe2\x80\x99 rich. I heard about it\r\naway down the river, too. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I come. You git me that money\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94I want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t got no money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie. Judge Thatcher\xe2\x80\x99s got it. You git it. I want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge Thatcher; he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make him pungle, too, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll know\r\nthe reason why. Say, how much you got in your pocket? I want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t got only a dollar, and I want that to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference what you want it for\xe2\x80\x94you just shell it\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was\r\ngoing down-town to get some whisky; said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a drink all day.\r\nWhen he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed\r\nme for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I\r\nreckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told\r\nme to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and\r\nlick me if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t drop that.\r\n\r\nNext day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher\xe2\x80\x99s and bullyragged\r\nhim, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and then\r\nhe swore he\xe2\x80\x99d make the law force him.\r\n\r\nThe judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away\r\nfrom him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge\r\nthat had just come, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the old man; so he said courts\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere and separate families if they could help it; said\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d druther not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher\r\nand the widow had to quit on the business.\r\n\r\nThat pleased the old man till he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d cowhide\r\nme till I was black and blue if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t raise some money for him.\r\nI borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and\r\ngot drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and\r\ncarrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most\r\nmidnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court,\r\nand jailed him again for a week. But he said _he_ was satisfied; said\r\nhe was boss of his son, and he\xe2\x80\x99d make it warm for _him._\r\n\r\nWhen he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.\r\nSo he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice,\r\nand had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and\r\nwas just old pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to\r\nhim about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to\r\nturn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be ashamed of, and he\r\nhoped the judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said\r\nhe could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried\r\nagain; pap said he\xe2\x80\x99d been a man that had always been misunderstood\r\nbefore, and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a\r\nman wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so\r\nthey cried again. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held\r\nout his hand, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain\xe2\x80\x99t so no more;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the hand of a man that\xe2\x80\x99s started in on a new life, and\xe2\x80\x99ll die\r\nbefore he\xe2\x80\x99ll go back. You mark them words\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t forget I said them.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a clean hand now; shake it\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be afeard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The\r\njudge\xe2\x80\x99s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge\xe2\x80\x94made\r\nhis mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or\r\nsomething like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful\r\nroom, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got\r\npowerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a\r\nstanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb\r\nback again and had a good old time; and toward daylight he crawled out\r\nagain, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left\r\narm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him\r\nafter sun-up. And when they come to look at that spare room they had to\r\ntake soundings before they could navigate it.\r\n\r\nThe judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform\r\nthe old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know no other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he\r\nwent for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money,\r\nand he went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a\r\ncouple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same,\r\nand dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to\r\nschool much before, but I reckoned I\xe2\x80\x99d go now to spite pap. That law\r\ntrial was a slow business\xe2\x80\x94appeared like they warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever going to get\r\nstarted on it; so every now and then I\xe2\x80\x99d borrow two or three dollars\r\noff of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time\r\nhe got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain\r\naround town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just\r\nsuited\xe2\x80\x94this kind of thing was right in his line.\r\n\r\nHe got to hanging around the widow\xe2\x80\x99s too much, and so she told him at\r\nlast that if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t quit using around there she would make trouble\r\nfor him. Well, _wasn\xe2\x80\x99t_ he mad? He said he would show who was Huck\r\nFinn\xe2\x80\x99s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and\r\ncatched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and\r\ncrossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where it was.\r\n\r\nHe kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.\r\nWe lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the\r\nkey under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,\r\nand we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little\r\nwhile he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the\r\nferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got\r\ndrunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where\r\nI was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but\r\npap drove him off with the gun, and it warn\xe2\x80\x99t long after that till I\r\nwas used to being where I was, and liked it\xe2\x80\x94all but the cowhide part.\r\n\r\nIt was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking\r\nand fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along,\r\nand my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see how I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\never got to like it so well at the widow\xe2\x80\x99s, where you had to wash, and\r\neat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be\r\nforever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you\r\nall the time. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing,\r\nbecause the widow didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it; but now I took to it again because\r\npap hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods\r\nthere, take it all around.\r\n\r\nBut by and by pap got too handy with his hick\xe2\x80\x99ry, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nit. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and\r\nlocking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was\r\ndreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\ngoing to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would\r\nfix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin\r\nmany a time, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find no way. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t a window to it\r\nbig enough for a dog to get through. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get up the chimbly; it\r\nwas too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty\r\ncareful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;\r\nI reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well,\r\nI was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put\r\nin the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old\r\nrusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and\r\nthe clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There\r\nwas an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of\r\nthe cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the\r\nchinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised\r\nthe blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I\r\nwas getting toward the end of it when I heard pap\xe2\x80\x99s gun in the woods.\r\nI got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my\r\nsaw, and pretty soon pap come in.\r\n\r\nPap warn\xe2\x80\x99t in a good humor\xe2\x80\x94so he was his natural self. He said he was\r\ndown-town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned\r\nhe would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started\r\non the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and\r\nJudge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for\r\nmy guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up\r\nconsiderable, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go back to the widow\xe2\x80\x99s any more\r\nand be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old\r\nman got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think\r\nof, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t skipped\r\nany, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all\r\nround, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthe names of, and so called them what\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name when he got to them,\r\nand went right along with his cussing.\r\n\r\nHe said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch\r\nout, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a\r\nplace six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till\r\nthey dropped and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find me. That made me pretty uneasy\r\nagain, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay on hand till\r\nhe got that chance.\r\n\r\nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got.\r\nThere was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,\r\nammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two\r\nnewspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went\r\nback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all\r\nover, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and\r\ntake to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in one\r\nplace, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night-times, and\r\nhunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man\r\nnor the widow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out\r\nand leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.\r\nI got so full of it I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice how long I was staying till the old\r\nman hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\r\n\r\nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While\r\nI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of\r\nwarmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town,\r\nand laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 thought he was Adam\xe2\x80\x94he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor\r\nbegun to work he most always went for the govment. This time he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it\xe2\x80\x99s like.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the law a-standing ready to take a man\xe2\x80\x99s son away from him\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety\r\nand all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that\r\nson raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfor _him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they\r\ncall _that_ govment! That ain\xe2\x80\x99t all, nuther. The law backs that old\r\nJudge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o\xe2\x80\x99 my property. Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and\r\nup\xe2\x80\x99ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets\r\nhim go round in clothes that ain\xe2\x80\x99t fitten for a hog. They call that\r\ngovment! A man can\xe2\x80\x99t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,\r\nand I _told_ \xe2\x80\x99em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nheard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I\xe2\x80\x99d leave the\r\nblamed country and never come a-near it ag\xe2\x80\x99in. Them\xe2\x80\x99s the very words. I\r\nsays, look at my hat\xe2\x80\x94if you call it a hat\xe2\x80\x94but the lid raises up and the\r\nrest of it goes down till it\xe2\x80\x99s below my chin, and then it ain\xe2\x80\x99t rightly\r\na hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstove-pipe. Look at it, says I\xe2\x80\x94such a hat for me to wear\xe2\x80\x94one of the\r\nwealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here.\r\nThere was a free nigger there from Ohio\xe2\x80\x94a mulatter, most as white as\r\na white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the\r\nshiniest hat; and there ain\xe2\x80\x99t a man in that town that\xe2\x80\x99s got as fine\r\nclothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a\r\nsilver-headed cane\xe2\x80\x94the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the state. And\r\nwhat do you think? They said he was a p\xe2\x80\x99fessor in a college, and could\r\ntalk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nwust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home. Well, that let\r\nme out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was \xe2\x80\x99lection\r\nday, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn\xe2\x80\x99t too drunk\r\nto get there; but when they told me there was a state in this country\r\nwhere they\xe2\x80\x99d let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I\xe2\x80\x99ll never vote\r\nag\xe2\x80\x99in. Them\xe2\x80\x99s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country\r\nmay rot for all me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll never vote ag\xe2\x80\x99in as long as I live. And to see\r\nthe cool way of that nigger\xe2\x80\x94why, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 give me the road if\r\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t shoved him out o\xe2\x80\x99 the way. I says to the people, why ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthis nigger put up at auction and sold?\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know. And\r\nwhat do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sold till\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d been in the state six months, and he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been there that long\r\nyet. There, now\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a specimen. They call that a govment that can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsell a free nigger till he\xe2\x80\x99s been in the state six months. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngovment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and\r\nthinks it is a govment, and yet\xe2\x80\x99s got to set stock-still for six whole\r\nmonths before it can take a-hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal,\r\nwhite-shirted free nigger, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPap was a-going on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was\r\ntaking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork\r\nand barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest\r\nkind of language\xe2\x80\x94mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he\r\ngive the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the\r\ncabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding\r\nfirst one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his\r\nleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of\r\nhis toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl\r\nthat fairly made a body\xe2\x80\x99s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and\r\nrolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over\r\nanything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards.\r\nHe had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid\r\nover him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.\r\n\r\nAfter supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for\r\ntwo drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged\r\nhe would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the\r\nkey, or saw myself out, one or t\xe2\x80\x99other. He drank and drank, and tumbled\r\ndown on his blankets by and by; but luck didn\xe2\x80\x99t run my way. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed\r\naround this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what\r\nI was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an\r\nawful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping\r\naround every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was\r\ncrawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say\r\none had bit him on the cheek\xe2\x80\x94but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no snakes. He started\r\nand run round and round the cabin, hollering \xe2\x80\x9cTake him off! take him\r\noff! he\xe2\x80\x99s biting me on the neck!\xe2\x80\x9d I never see a man look so wild in the\r\neyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he\r\nrolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,\r\nand striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and\r\nsaying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid\r\nstill awhile, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a sound. I\r\ncould hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed\r\nterrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised\r\nup part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTramp\xe2\x80\x94tramp\xe2\x80\x94tramp; that\xe2\x80\x99s the dead; tramp\xe2\x80\x94tramp\xe2\x80\x94tramp; they\xe2\x80\x99re coming\r\nafter me; but I won\xe2\x80\x99t go. Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re here! don\xe2\x80\x99t touch me\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t! hands\r\noff\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him\r\nalone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under\r\nthe old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I\r\ncould hear him through the blanket.\r\n\r\nBy and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he\r\nsee me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a\r\nclasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill\r\nme, and then I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come for him no more. I begged, and told him\r\nI was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared\r\nand cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and\r\ndodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my\r\nshoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick\r\nas lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and\r\ndropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a\r\nminute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would\r\nsleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.\r\n\r\nSo he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom chair\r\nand clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down\r\nthe gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, and\r\nthen I laid it across the turnip-barrel, pointing towards pap, and set\r\ndown behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time\r\ndid drag along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGit up! What you \xe2\x80\x99bout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It\r\nwas after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me\r\nlooking sour\xe2\x80\x94and sick, too. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you doin\xe2\x80\x99 with this gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI judged he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you roust me out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I tried to, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stand there palavering all day, but out with\r\nyou and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be along\r\nin a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed\r\nsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling\r\nof bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would\r\nhave great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to\r\nbe always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes\r\ncordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts\xe2\x80\x94sometimes a dozen logs\r\ntogether; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the\r\nwoodyards and the sawmill.\r\n\r\nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t\xe2\x80\x99other one out\r\nfor what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes\r\na canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long,\r\nriding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,\r\nclothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that\r\nto fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t so this time. It was a\r\ndrift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks\r\nI, the old man will be glad when he sees this\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s worth ten dollars.\r\nBut when I got to shore pap wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in sight yet, and as I was running\r\nher into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and\r\nwillows, I struck another idea: I judged I\xe2\x80\x99d hide her good, and then,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I\xe2\x80\x99d go down the river\r\nabout fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a\r\nrough time tramping on foot.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man\r\ncoming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked\r\naround a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a\r\npiece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a \xe2\x80\x9ctrot\xe2\x80\x9d line. He abused\r\nme a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and\r\nthat was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and\r\nthen he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines\r\nand went home.\r\n\r\nWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about\r\nwore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap\r\nand the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing\r\nthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you\r\nsee, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see no way for a\r\nwhile, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of\r\nwater, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you\r\nhear? That man warn\xe2\x80\x99t here for no good. I\xe2\x80\x99d a shot him. Next time you\r\nroust me out, you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he dropped down and went to sleep again; what he had been saying\r\ngive me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so\r\nnobody won\xe2\x80\x99t think of following me.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The\r\nriver was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the\r\nrise. By and by along comes part of a log raft\xe2\x80\x94nine logs fast together.\r\nWe went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner.\r\nAnybody but pap would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 waited and seen the day through, so as to\r\ncatch more stuff; but that warn\xe2\x80\x99t pap\xe2\x80\x99s style. Nine logs was enough\r\nfor one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked\r\nme in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half\r\npast three. I judged he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come back that night. I waited till I\r\nreckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to\r\nwork on that log again. Before he was t\xe2\x80\x99other side of the river I was\r\nout of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away\r\noff yonder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUCKLEBERRY FINN]\r\n\r\nI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid,\r\nand shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the\r\nsame with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee\r\nand sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took\r\nthe bucket and gourd; took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and\r\ntwo blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and\r\nmatches and other things\xe2\x80\x94everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned\r\nout the place. I wanted an ax, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any, only the one out\r\nat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched\r\nout the gun, and now I was done.\r\n\r\nI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\r\nout so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\r\nby scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and\r\nthe sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put\r\ntwo rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent\r\nup at that place and didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite touch ground. If you stood four or\r\nfive foot away and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was sawed, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t never notice\r\nit; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn\xe2\x80\x99t likely\r\nanybody would go fooling around there.\r\n\r\nIt was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t left a track. I\r\nfollowed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the\r\nriver. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the\r\nwoods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig;\r\nhogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the\r\nprairie-farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\r\n\r\nI took the ax and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it\r\nconsiderable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\r\nto the table and hacked into his throat with the ax, and laid him down\r\non the ground to bleed; I say ground because it _was_ ground\xe2\x80\x94hard\r\npacked, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of\r\nbig rocks in it\xe2\x80\x94all I could drag\xe2\x80\x94and I started it from the pig, and\r\ndragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and\r\ndumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that\r\nsomething had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was\r\nthere; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and\r\nthrow in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer\r\nin such a thing as that.\r\n\r\nWell, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the ax good, and\r\nstuck it on the back side, and slung the ax in the corner. Then I took\r\nup the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndrip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\r\nthe river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag\r\nof meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\r\nI took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\r\nbottom of it with the saw, for there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no knives and forks on the\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then\r\nI carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\r\nthe willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile\r\nwide and full of rushes\xe2\x80\x94and ducks too, you might say, in the season.\r\nThere was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that\r\nwent miles away, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the river.\r\nThe meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I\r\ndropped pap\xe2\x80\x99s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done\r\nby accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal-sack with a string, so\r\nit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\r\n\r\nIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\r\nwillows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I\r\nmade fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\r\ndown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\r\ndrag the river for me. And they\xe2\x80\x99ll follow that meal track to the lake\r\nand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\r\nthat killed me and took the things. They won\xe2\x80\x99t ever hunt the river\r\nfor anything but my dead carcass. They\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get tired of that, and\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want\r\nto. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty\r\nwell, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town\r\nnights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s Island\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nI was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I\r\nwoke up I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked\r\naround, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and\r\nmiles across. The moon was so bright I could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 counted the drift-logs\r\nthat went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\r\nshore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\r\nYou know what I mean\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the words to put it in.\r\n\r\nI took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and\r\nstart when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon\r\nI made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\r\noars working in rowlocks when it\xe2\x80\x99s a still night. I peeped out through\r\nthe willow branches, and there it was\xe2\x80\x94a skiff, away across the water.\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was\r\nabreast of me I see there warn\xe2\x80\x99t but one man in it. Thinks I, maybe\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s pap, though I warn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting him. He dropped below me with the\r\ncurrent, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\r\nand he went by so close I could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 reached out the gun and touched\r\nhim. Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough\xe2\x80\x94and sober, too, by the way he laid\r\nhis oars.\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down-stream\r\nsoft, but quick, in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half,\r\nand then struck out a quarter of a mile or more toward the middle of\r\nthe river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry-landing,\r\nand people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood,\r\nand then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I\r\nlaid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\r\naway into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when\r\nyou lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\r\nAnd how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people\r\ntalking at the ferry-landing. I heard what they said, too\xe2\x80\x94every word\r\nof it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\r\nnights now. T\xe2\x80\x99other one said _this_ warn\xe2\x80\x99t one of the short ones, he\r\nreckoned\xe2\x80\x94and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\r\nlaughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\r\nlaughed, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\r\nlet him alone. The first fellow said he \xe2\x80\x99lowed to tell it to his old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say\r\nit was nearly three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait more\r\nthan about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further\r\naway, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out the words any more; but I could hear the\r\nmumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\r\n\r\nI was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nIsland, about two mile and a half down-stream, heavy-timbered and\r\nstanding up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid,\r\nlike a steamboat without any lights. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t any signs of the bar\r\nat the head\xe2\x80\x94it was all under water now.\r\n\r\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping\r\nrate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\r\nlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a\r\ndeep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\r\nbranches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 seen the\r\ncanoe from the outside.\r\n\r\nI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\r\nout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the\r\ntown, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.\r\nA monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up-stream, coming along\r\ndown, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping\r\ndown, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\xe2\x80\x9d I heard that just as\r\nplain as if the man was by my side.\r\n\r\nThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods,\r\nand laid down for a nap before breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\r\nthings, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I\r\ncould see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\r\nall about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places\r\non the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\r\nfreckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\r\nbreeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\r\nvery friendly.\r\n\r\nI was powerful lazy and comfortable\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get up and cook\r\nbreakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\r\nsound of \xe2\x80\x9cboom!\xe2\x80\x9d away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\r\nand listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and\r\nlooked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\r\non the water a long ways up\xe2\x80\x94about abreast the ferry. And there was the\r\nferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the\r\nmatter now. \xe2\x80\x9cBoom!\xe2\x80\x9d I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\r\ncarcass come to the top.\r\n\r\nI was pretty hungry, but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t going to do for me to start a fire,\r\nbecause they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the\r\ncannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there,\r\nand it always looks pretty on a summer morning\xe2\x80\x94so I was having a good\r\nenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\r\neat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\r\nloaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to\r\nthe drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep a lookout,\r\nand if any of them\xe2\x80\x99s floating around after me I\xe2\x80\x99ll give them a show.\r\nI changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\r\nhave, and I warn\xe2\x80\x99t disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I\r\nmost got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\r\nfurther. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\r\nshore\xe2\x80\x94I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one,\r\nand this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\r\nof quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was \xe2\x80\x9cbaker\xe2\x80\x99s bread\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what the\r\nquality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\r\n\r\nI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\r\nthe bread and watching the ferryboat, and very well satisfied. And then\r\nsomething struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or\r\nsomebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\r\nand done it. So there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no doubt but there is something in that\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94that is, there\xe2\x80\x99s something in it when a body like the widow or\r\nthe parson prays, but it don\xe2\x80\x99t work for me, and I reckon it don\xe2\x80\x99t work\r\nfor only just the right kind.\r\n\r\nI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The\r\nferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I\xe2\x80\x99d have a\r\nchance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would\r\ncome in close, where the bread did. When she\xe2\x80\x99d got pretty well along\r\ndown towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the\r\nbread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.\r\nWhere the log forked I could peep through.\r\n\r\nBy and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.\r\nPap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Joe Harper, and Tom\r\nSawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\r\nEverybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. I\r\nhope so, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\r\nin my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could\r\nsee them first-rate, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see me. Then the captain sung\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x9cStand away!\xe2\x80\x9d and the cannon let off such a blast right before\r\nme that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the\r\nsmoke, and I judged I was gone. If they\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 had some bullets in, I\r\nreckon they\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight\r\naround the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and\r\nthen, further and further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got\r\nto the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t yet awhile. They\r\nturned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the\r\nMissouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I\r\ncrossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the\r\nhead of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri\r\nshore and went home to the town.\r\n\r\nI knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after\r\nme. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the\r\nthick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my\r\nthings under so the rain couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get at them. I catched a catfish\r\nand haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my\r\ncamp-fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nWhen it was dark I set by my camp-fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\r\nsatisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\r\non the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\r\nstars and drift-logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stay so, you soon get over it.\r\n\r\nAnd so for three days and nights. No difference\xe2\x80\x94just the same thing.\r\nBut the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I\r\nwas boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\r\nall about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty\r\nstrawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\r\nrazberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They\r\nwould all come handy by and by, I judged.\r\n\r\nWell, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfar from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t shot\r\nnothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\r\nhome. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and\r\nit went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it,\r\ntrying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\r\nbounded right on to the ashes of a camp-fire that was still smoking.\r\n\r\nMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look\r\nfurther, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\r\nfast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\r\nthick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear\r\nnothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\r\nand so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\r\non a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of\r\nmy breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to camp I warn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling very brash, there warn\xe2\x80\x99t much sand\r\nin my craw; but I says, this ain\xe2\x80\x99t no time to be fooling around. So I\r\ngot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\r\nand I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\r\nold last-year\xe2\x80\x99s camp, and then clumb a tree.\r\n\r\nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see nothing, I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t hear nothing\xe2\x80\x94I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\r\nthousand things. Well, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay up there forever; so at last\r\nI got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\r\ntime. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and\r\ndark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\r\nIllinois bank\xe2\x80\x94about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and\r\ncooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\r\nall night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk_, _plunkety-plunk_, and says\r\nto myself, horses coming; and next I hear people\xe2\x80\x99s voices. I got\r\neverything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\r\nthrough the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got far when I\r\nhear a man say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\r\nbeat out. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the\r\nold place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep much. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, somehow, for thinking. And every time\r\nI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can\xe2\x80\x99t live this way; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na-going to find out who it is that\xe2\x80\x99s here on the island with me; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.\r\n\r\nSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\r\nthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was\r\nshining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\r\nI poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\r\nasleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.\r\nA little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as\r\nsaying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and\r\nbrung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the\r\nedge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through\r\nthe leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to\r\nblanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the\r\ntree-tops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped\r\noff towards where I had run across that camp-fire, stopping every\r\nminute or two to listen. But I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no luck somehow; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nto find the place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse\r\nof fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By\r\nand by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the\r\nground. It most give me the fantods. He had a blanket around his head,\r\nand his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of\r\nbushes in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was\r\ngetting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself\r\nand hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson\xe2\x80\x99s Jim! I bet I was\r\nglad to see him. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Jim!\xe2\x80\x9d and skipped out.\r\n\r\nHe bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees,\r\nand puts his hands together and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoan\xe2\x80\x99 hurt me\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t! I hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever done no harm to a ghos\xe2\x80\x99. I alwuz\r\nliked dead people, en done all I could for \xe2\x80\x99em. You go en git in de\r\nriver ag\xe2\x80\x99in, whah you b\xe2\x80\x99longs, en doan\xe2\x80\x99 do nuffn to Ole Jim, \xe2\x80\x99at \xe2\x80\x99uz\r\nalwuz yo\xe2\x80\x99 fren\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, I warn\xe2\x80\x99t long making him understand I warn\xe2\x80\x99t dead. I was ever so\r\nglad to see Jim. I warn\xe2\x80\x99t lonesome now. I told him I warn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of\r\n_him_ telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set\r\nthere and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good daylight. Le\xe2\x80\x99s get breakfast. Make up your camp-fire good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s de use er makin\xe2\x80\x99 up de camp-fire to cook strawbries en sich\r\ntruck? But you got a gun, hain\xe2\x80\x99t you?

Now you kill sumfn en I\xe2\x80\x99ll make up de fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\r\na grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\r\ncoffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\r\nnigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\r\nwith witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him\r\nwith his knife, and fried him.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\r\nJim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then\r\nwhen we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.\r\n\r\nBy and by Jim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat \xe2\x80\x99uz killed in dat shanty ef it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.

Then I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you come to be here, Jim, and how\xe2\x80\x99d you get here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing for a minute. Then he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I better not tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dey\xe2\x80\x99s reasons.

I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to tell,\r\nand I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le\xe2\x80\x99s know all about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, it \xe2\x80\x99uz dis way.

But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader\r\nroun\xe2\x80\x99 de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one\r\nnight I creeps to de do\xe2\x80\x99 pooty late, en de do\xe2\x80\x99 warn\xe2\x80\x99t quite shet, en I\r\nhear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans,\r\nbut she didn\xe2\x80\x99 want to, but she could git eight hund\xe2\x80\x99d dollars for me,\r\nen it \xe2\x80\x99uz sich a big stack o\xe2\x80\x99 money she couldn\xe2\x80\x99 resis\xe2\x80\x99. De widder she\r\ntry to git her to say she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, but I never waited to hear de\r\nres\xe2\x80\x99. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tuck out en shin down de hill, en \xe2\x80\x99spec to steal a skift \xe2\x80\x99long de\r\nsho\xe2\x80\x99 som\xe2\x80\x99ers \xe2\x80\x99bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid\r\nin de ole tumbledown cooper shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go\r\n\xe2\x80\x99way.

I\xe2\x80\x99d made up my mine \xe2\x80\x99bout\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99s a-gwyne to do. You see, ef I kep\xe2\x80\x99 on tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to git away afoot,\r\nde dogs \xe2\x80\x99ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey\xe2\x80\x99d miss dat\r\nskift, you see, en dey\xe2\x80\x99d know \xe2\x80\x99bout whah I\xe2\x80\x99d lan\xe2\x80\x99 on de yuther side, en\r\nwhah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I\xe2\x80\x99s arter; it doan\xe2\x80\x99\r\n_make_ no track.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a light a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 roun\xe2\x80\x99 de p\xe2\x80\x99int bymeby, so I wade\xe2\x80\x99 in en shove\xe2\x80\x99\r\na log ahead o\xe2\x80\x99 me en swum more\xe2\x80\x99n half-way acrost de river, en got in\r\n\xe2\x80\x99mongst de driftwood, en kep\xe2\x80\x99 my head down low, en kinder swum agin de\r\ncurrent tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck\r\na-holt. It clouded up en \xe2\x80\x99uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb\r\nup en laid down on de planks. De men \xe2\x80\x99uz all \xe2\x80\x99way yonder in de middle,\r\nwhah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin\xe2\x80\x99, en dey wuz a good current;\r\nso I reck\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99at by fo\xe2\x80\x99 in de mawnin\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d be twenty-five mile down de\r\nriver, en den I\xe2\x80\x99d slip in jis b\xe2\x80\x99fo\xe2\x80\x99 daylight en swim asho\xe2\x80\x99, en take to\r\nde woods on de Illinois side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99 have no luck. When we \xe2\x80\x99uz mos\xe2\x80\x99 down to de head er de\r\nislan\xe2\x80\x99 a man begin to come aft wid de lantern. I see it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use\r\nfer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan\xe2\x80\x99. Well, I\r\nhad a notion I could lan\xe2\x80\x99 mos\xe2\x80\x99 anywhers, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94bank too bluff.\r\nI \xe2\x80\x99uz mos\xe2\x80\x99 to de foot er de islan\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99fo\xe2\x80\x99 I foun\xe2\x80\x99 a good place. I went\r\ninto de woods en jedged I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 fool wid raffs no mo\xe2\x80\x99, long as dey\r\nmove de lantern roun\xe2\x80\x99 so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg en some\r\nmatches in my cap, en dey warn\xe2\x80\x99t wet, so I \xe2\x80\x99uz all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you ain\xe2\x80\x99t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you get mud-turkles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you gwyne to git \xe2\x80\x99m? You can\xe2\x80\x99t slip up on um en grab um; en how\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night?\r\nEn I warn\xe2\x80\x99t gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s so. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of\r\ncourse. Did you hear \xe2\x80\x99em shooting the cannon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah\xe2\x80\x94watched um\r\nthoo de bushes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and\r\nlighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a\r\nsign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the\r\nsame way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them,\r\nbut Jim wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid\r\nmighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny\r\nsaid his father would die, and he did.\r\n\r\nAnd Jim said you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t count the things you are going to cook for\r\ndinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the\r\ntablecloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that\r\nman died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning,\r\nor else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said\r\nbees wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sting idiots; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that, because I had\r\ntried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sting me.\r\n\r\nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim\r\nknowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it\r\nlooked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him\r\nif there warn\xe2\x80\x99t any good-luck signs. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMighty few\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 _dey_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use to a body. What you want to know\r\nwhen good luck\xe2\x80\x99s a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 for? Want to keep it off?\xe2\x80\x9d And he said: \xe2\x80\x9cEf\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99s got hairy arms en a hairy breas\xe2\x80\x99, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign dat you\xe2\x80\x99s a-gwyne\r\nto be rich. Well, dey\xe2\x80\x99s some use in a sign like dat, \xe2\x80\x99kase it\xe2\x80\x99s so fur\r\nahead. You see, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99s got to be po\xe2\x80\x99 a long time fust, en so you\r\nmight git discourage\xe2\x80\x99 en kill yo\xe2\x80\x99sef \xe2\x80\x99f you didn\xe2\x80\x99 know by de sign dat\r\nyou gwyne to be rich bymeby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s de use to ax dat question? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see I has?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you rich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich ag\xe2\x80\x99in. Wunst I had\r\nfoteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99, en got busted out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you speculate in, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, fust I tackled stock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of stock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, live stock\xe2\x80\x94cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99 gwyne to resk no mo\xe2\x80\x99 money in stock. De cow up \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 died on my\r\nhan\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you lost the ten dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose it all.

Did you speculate any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b\xe2\x80\x99longs to old Misto\r\nBradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar\r\nwould git fo\xe2\x80\x99 dollars mo\xe2\x80\x99 at de en\xe2\x80\x99 er de year.

So\r\nI stuck out for mo\xe2\x80\x99 dan fo\xe2\x80\x99 dollars, en I said \xe2\x80\x99f I didn\xe2\x80\x99 git it I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstart a bank mysef. Well, o\xe2\x80\x99 course dat nigger want\xe2\x80\x99 to keep me out er\r\nde business, bekase he says dey warn\xe2\x80\x99t business \xe2\x80\x99nough for two banks,\r\nso he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de\r\nen\xe2\x80\x99 er de year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I done it.

Dey wuz a nigger name\xe2\x80\x99 Bob, dat had\r\nketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn\xe2\x80\x99 know it; en I bought it\r\noff\xe2\x80\x99n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en\xe2\x80\x99 er de\r\nyear come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex\xe2\x80\x99 day de\r\none-laigged nigger say de bank\xe2\x80\x99s busted. So dey didn\xe2\x80\x99 none uv us git no\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do with the ten cents, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I \xe2\x80\x99uz gwyne to spen\xe2\x80\x99 it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me\r\nto give it to a nigger name\xe2\x80\x99 Balum\xe2\x80\x94Balum\xe2\x80\x99s Ass dey call him for short;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s one er dem chuckleheads, you know.

I owns mysef, en I\xe2\x80\x99s wuth\r\neight hund\xe2\x80\x99d dollars. I wisht I had de money, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 want no mo\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\r\nbecause the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nThis place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\r\nhigh. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep\r\nand the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and\r\nby and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on\r\nthe side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\r\nbunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in\r\nthere. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\r\n\r\nJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the\r\ntraps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the\r\nisland, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he\r\nsaid them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want\r\nthe things to get wet?\r\n\r\nSo we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\r\nand lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by\r\nto hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off\r\nof the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\r\nside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\r\ngood place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\r\n\r\nWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in\r\nthere. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.\r\nPretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the\r\nbirds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained\r\nlike all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of\r\nthese regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all\r\nblue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so\r\nthick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby;\r\nand here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and\r\nturn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of\r\na gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms\r\nas if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest\r\nand blackest\xe2\x80\x94_fst!_ it was as bright as glory, and you\xe2\x80\x99d have a little\r\nglimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,\r\nhundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\r\nin a second, and now you\xe2\x80\x99d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\r\nand then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\r\nunder side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down-stairs\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim, this is nice,\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be nowhere else but\r\nhere. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 ben here \xe2\x80\x99f it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 ben for Jim. You\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittin\xe2\x80\x99 mos\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndrownded, too; dat you would, honey. Chickens knows when it\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to\r\nrain, en so do de birds, chile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at\r\nlast it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on\r\nthe island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side\r\nit was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\r\nold distance across\xe2\x80\x94a half a mile\xe2\x80\x94because the Missouri shore was just a\r\nwall of high bluffs.\r\n\r\nDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe. It was mighty\r\ncool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.\r\nWe went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines\r\nhung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every\r\nold broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things;\r\nand when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame,\r\non account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\r\nhand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwould slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of\r\nthem. We could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 had pets enough if we\xe2\x80\x99d wanted them.\r\n\r\nOne night we catched a little section of a lumber-raft\xe2\x80\x94nice pine\r\nplanks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,\r\nand the top stood above water six or seven inches\xe2\x80\x94a solid, level floor.\r\nWe could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them\r\ngo; we didn\xe2\x80\x99t show ourselves in daylight.\r\n\r\nAnother night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\r\ndaylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was\r\na two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got\r\naboard\xe2\x80\x94clumb in at an up-stairs window. But it was too dark to see yet,\r\nso we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\r\n\r\nThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then\r\nwe looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and\r\ntwo old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\r\nwas clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the\r\nfloor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it didn\xe2\x80\x99t budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe man ain\xe2\x80\x99t asleep\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s dead. You hold still\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go en see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went, and bent down and looked, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He\xe2\x80\x99s ben shot in de back. I\r\nreck\xe2\x80\x99n he\xe2\x80\x99s ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan\xe2\x80\x99 look\r\nat his face\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too gashly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\r\nhe needn\xe2\x80\x99t done it; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see him. There was heaps of old\r\ngreasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky-bottles,\r\nand a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\r\nwas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\r\nThere was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men\xe2\x80\x99s clothing,\r\ntoo. We put the lot into the canoe\xe2\x80\x94it might come good. There was a\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there\r\nwas a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\r\nbaby to suck. We would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 took the bottle, but it was broke. There was\r\na seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They\r\nstood open, but there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing left in them that was any account.\r\nThe way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a\r\nhurry, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\r\n\r\nWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle,\r\nand a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of\r\ntallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup,\r\nand a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and\r\npins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and\r\na hatchet and some nails, and a fish-line as thick as my little finger\r\nwith some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather\r\ndog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable\r\ngood currycomb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden\r\nleg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good\r\nenough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim,\r\nand we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the other one, though we hunted all around.\r\n\r\nAnd so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready\r\nto shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was\r\npretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with\r\nthe quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a\r\ngood ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down\r\nmost a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank,\r\nand hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no accidents and didn\xe2\x80\x99t see nobody. We got home all safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how\r\nhe come to be killed, but Jim didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. He said it would fetch\r\nbad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha\xe2\x80\x99nt us; he said a\r\nman that warn\xe2\x80\x99t buried was more likely to go a-ha\xe2\x80\x99nting around than\r\none that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable,\r\nso I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say no more; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep from studying over it and\r\nwishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.\r\n\r\nWe rummaged the clothes we\xe2\x80\x99d got, and found eight dollars in silver\r\nsewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned\r\nthe people in that house stole the coat, because if they\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 knowed\r\nthe money was there they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 left it. I said I reckoned they\r\nkilled him, too; but Jim didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about that. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you think it\xe2\x80\x99s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched\r\nin the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before\r\nyesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a\r\nsnake-skin with my hands. Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s your bad luck! We\xe2\x80\x99ve raked in\r\nall this truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad\r\nluck like this every day, Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind, honey, never you mind. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you git too peart. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na-comin\xe2\x80\x99. Mind I tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s a-comin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after\r\ndinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the\r\nridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some, and\r\nfound a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the\r\nfoot of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there\xe2\x80\x99d be some fun\r\nwhen Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,\r\nand when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light\r\nthe snake\xe2\x80\x99s mate was there, and bit him.\r\n\r\nHe jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the\r\nvarmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a\r\nsecond with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap\xe2\x80\x99s whisky-jug and begun to pour\r\nit down.\r\n\r\nHe was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all\r\ncomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you\r\nleave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.\r\nJim told me to chop off the snake\xe2\x80\x99s head and throw it away, and then\r\nskin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and\r\nsaid it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie\r\nthem around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid\r\nout quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could\r\nhelp it.\r\n\r\nJim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his\r\nhead and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself\r\nhe went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big,\r\nand so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I\r\njudged he was all right; but I\xe2\x80\x99d druther been bit with a snake than\r\npap\xe2\x80\x99s whisky.\r\n\r\nJim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all\r\ngone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever take\r\na-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had\r\ncome of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And\r\nhe said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe\r\nwe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new\r\nmoon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a\r\nsnake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,\r\nthough I\xe2\x80\x99ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left\r\nshoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can\r\ndo. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less\r\nthan two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread\r\nhimself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and\r\nthey slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried\r\nhim so, so they say, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it. Pap told me. But anyway it\r\nall come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.\r\n\r\nWell, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\r\nagain; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\r\nhooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\r\nas big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\r\nhundred pounds. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle him, of course; he would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 flung\r\nus into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\r\ntill he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\r\nball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,\r\nand there was a spool in it. Jim said he\xe2\x80\x99d had it there a long time,\r\nto coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was\r\never catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever seen\r\na bigger one. He would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been worth a good deal over at the village.\r\nThey peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house\r\nthere; everybody buys some of him; his meat\xe2\x80\x99s as white as snow and\r\nmakes a good fry.\r\n\r\nNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get\r\na stirring-up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river\r\nand find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I\r\nmust go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\r\nThat was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico\r\ngowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim\r\nhitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the\r\nsun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\r\nand see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said\r\nnobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practised around\r\nall day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\r\nwell in them, only Jim said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t walk like a girl; and he said\r\nI must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket. I took\r\nnotice, and done better.\r\n\r\nI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.\r\n\r\nI started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing,\r\nand the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.\r\nI tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a\r\nlittle shanty that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered\r\nwho had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the\r\nwindow. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by\r\na candle that was on a pine table. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know her face; she was a\r\nstranger, for you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t start a face in that town that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting\r\nafraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if\r\nthis woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me\r\nall I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget I was a girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d says the woman, and I did. She says: \xe2\x80\x9cTake a cheer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat might your name be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSarah Williams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x99m. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I\xe2\x80\x99ve walked all the way and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m all tired out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHungry, too, I reckon. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x99m, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below\r\nhere at a farm; so I ain\xe2\x80\x99t hungry no more. It\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me so late.\r\nMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to\r\ntell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at the upper end of the town, she\r\nsays. I hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever been here before. Do you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know everybody yet. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t lived here quite two\r\nweeks. It\xe2\x80\x99s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You\r\nbetter stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll rest awhile, I reckon, and go on. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t afeard of\r\nthe dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in\r\nby and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she\xe2\x80\x99d send him along with\r\nme. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations\r\nup the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much\r\nbetter off they used to was, and how they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know but they\xe2\x80\x99d made a\r\nmistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone\xe2\x80\x94and so on and\r\nso on, till I was afeard _I_ had made a mistake coming to her to find\r\nout what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap\r\nand the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right\r\nalong. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the twelve thousand\r\ndollars (only she got it twenty) and all about pap and what a hard lot\r\nhe was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I\r\nwas murdered. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho done it? We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard considerable about these goings-on down in\r\nHookerville, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who \xe2\x80\x99twas that killed Huck Finn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I reckon there\xe2\x80\x99s a right smart chance of people _here_ that \xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94is that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost everybody thought it at first. He\xe2\x80\x99ll never know how nigh he come\r\nto getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it\r\nwas done by a runaway nigger named Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy _he_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never\r\nnoticed I had put in at all:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na reward out for him\xe2\x80\x94three hundred dollars. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a reward out\r\nfor old Finn, too\xe2\x80\x94two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the\r\nmorning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with \xe2\x80\x99em on\r\nthe ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night\r\nthey wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day\r\nthey found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ben seen\r\nsence ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on\r\nhim, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old\r\nFinn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for\r\nthe nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that\r\nevening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple\r\nof mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he\r\nhain\xe2\x80\x99t come back sence, and they ain\xe2\x80\x99t looking for him back till this\r\nthing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy\r\nand fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nget Huck\xe2\x80\x99s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.\r\nPeople do say he warn\xe2\x80\x99t any too good to do it. Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s sly, I reckon.\r\nIf he don\xe2\x80\x99t come back for a year he\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. You can\xe2\x80\x99t prove\r\nanything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll walk in Huck\xe2\x80\x99s money as easy as nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I reckon so, \xe2\x80\x99m. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see nothing in the way of it. Has\r\neverybody quit thinking the nigger done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But they\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nthe nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, are they after him yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re innocent, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you! Does three hundred dollars lay\r\naround every day for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t far from here. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them\xe2\x80\x94but I hain\xe2\x80\x99t talked it around. A\r\nfew days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in\r\nthe log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to\r\nthat island over yonder that they call Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s Island. Don\xe2\x80\x99t anybody\r\nlive there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say any more, but\r\nI done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I\xe2\x80\x99d seen smoke over\r\nthere, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I\r\nsays to myself, like as not that nigger\xe2\x80\x99s hiding over there; anyway,\r\nsays I, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, if it was him; but\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s going over to see\xe2\x80\x94him and another man. He was gone up the\r\nriver; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here\r\ntwo hours ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had got so uneasy I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t set still. I had to do something with\r\nmy hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading\r\nit. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman\r\nstopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious\r\nand smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to\r\nbe interested\xe2\x80\x94and I was, too\xe2\x80\x94and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get\r\nit. Is your husband going over there to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a\r\nboat and see if they could borrow another gun. They\xe2\x80\x99ll go over after\r\nmidnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the nigger see better, too? After midnight he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlikely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt\r\nup his camp-fire all the better for the dark, if he\xe2\x80\x99s got one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel a bit\r\ncomfortable. Pretty soon she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say your name was, honey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x94Mary Williams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t look up\xe2\x80\x94seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of\r\ncornered, and was afeard maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the\r\nwoman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I\r\nwas. But now she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoney, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes\xe2\x80\x99m, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s my first name. Some\r\ncalls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look up yet.\r\n\r\nWell, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how\r\npoor they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned\r\nthe place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was\r\nright about the rats. You\xe2\x80\x99d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the\r\ncorner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to\r\nthrow at them when she was alone, or they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give her no peace.\r\nShe showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a\r\ngood shot with it generly, but she\xe2\x80\x99d wrenched her arm a day or two ago,\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a\r\nchance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cOuch!\xe2\x80\x9d it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next\r\none. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of\r\ncourse I didn\xe2\x80\x99t let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed\r\nhis nose I let drive, and if he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 stayed where he was he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\na tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\r\nwould hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\r\nit back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\r\nher with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\r\nwent on talking about her and her husband\xe2\x80\x99s matters. But she broke off\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap,\r\nhandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped\r\nmy legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a\r\nminute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\r\nand very pleasant, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, what\xe2\x80\x99s your real name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWh-hat, mum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?\xe2\x80\x94or what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know hardly what to do. But\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to don\xe2\x80\x99t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I\xe2\x80\x99m in the\r\nway here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you won\xe2\x80\x99t. Set down and stay where you are. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to\r\nhurt you, and I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me\r\nyour secret, and trust me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it; and, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I\xe2\x80\x99ll help\r\nyou. So\xe2\x80\x99ll my old man if you want him to. You see, you\xe2\x80\x99re a runaway\r\n\xe2\x80\x99prentice, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t no harm in it.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Bless you,\r\nchild, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I said it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I\r\nwould just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead,\r\nand the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty\r\nmile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it\r\nno longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\r\nchance and stole some of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s old clothes and cleared out,\r\nand I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights,\r\nand hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried\r\nfrom home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed\r\nmy uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I\r\nstruck out for this town of Goshen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoshen, child? This ain\xe2\x80\x99t Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen\xe2\x80\x99s ten\r\nmile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn\r\ninto the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I\r\nmust take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no matter now. I got\r\nto be moving along. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch Goshen before daylight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on a minute. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she put me up a snack, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, when a cow\xe2\x80\x99s laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer\r\nup prompt now\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hind end, mum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, a horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe for\xe2\x80\x99rard end, mum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich side of a tree does the moss grow on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorth side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with\r\ntheir heads pointed the same direction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole fifteen, mum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country. I thought maybe you\r\nwas trying to hocus me again. What\xe2\x80\x99s your real name, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Peters, mum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, try to remember it, George. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget and tell me it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nElexander before you go, and then get out by saying it\xe2\x80\x99s George\r\nElexander when I catch you. And don\xe2\x80\x99t go about women in that old\r\ncalico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.\r\nBless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don\xe2\x80\x99t hold the\r\nthread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and\r\npoke the thread at it; that\xe2\x80\x99s the way a woman most always does, but a\r\nman always does t\xe2\x80\x99other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything,\r\nhitch yourself up a-tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as\r\nawkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw\r\nstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it\r\nto turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm\r\nout to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to\r\ncatch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don\xe2\x80\x99t clap\r\nthem together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.\r\nWhy, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I\r\ncontrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your\r\nuncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into\r\ntrouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nwhat I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and\r\nnext time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nrocky one, and your feet \xe2\x80\x99ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen,\r\nI reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks\r\nand slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.\r\nI jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to\r\nmake the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the\r\nsun-bonnet, for I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want no blinders on then. When I was about the\r\nmiddle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the\r\nsound come faint over the water but clear\xe2\x80\x94eleven. When I struck the\r\nhead of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded,\r\nbut I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and\r\nstarted a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\r\n\r\nThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half\r\nbelow, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber\r\nand up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on\r\nthe ground. I roused him out and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGit up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a minute to lose. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nafter us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he\r\nworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By\r\nthat time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was\r\nready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put\r\nout the camp-fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t show a\r\ncandle outside after that.\r\n\r\nI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;\r\nbut if there was a boat around I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see it, for stars and shadows\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down\r\nin the shade, past the foot of the island dead still\xe2\x80\x94never saying a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been close on to one o\xe2\x80\x99clock when we got below the island\r\nat last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come\r\nalong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\r\nshore; and it was well a boat didn\xe2\x80\x99t come, for we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever thought\r\nto put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We\r\nwas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngood judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\r\n\r\nIf the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp-fire I\r\nbuilt, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed\r\naway from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.\r\n\r\nWhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\r\nbig bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\r\nthe hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\r\nhad been a cave-in in the bank there. A towhead is a sand-bar that has\r\ncottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\r\n\r\nWe had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\r\nside, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so\r\nwe warn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day,\r\nand watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\r\nup-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all\r\nabout the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\r\na smart one, and if she was to start after us herself _she_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nset down and watch a camp-fire\xe2\x80\x94no, sir, she\xe2\x80\x99d fetch a dog. Well, then,\r\nI said, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he\r\nbet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and\r\nhe believed they must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost\r\nall that time, or else we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here on a towhead sixteen or\r\nseventeen mile below the village\xe2\x80\x94no, indeedy, we would be in that same\r\nold town again. So I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care what was the reason they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget us as long as they didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\r\ncottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in\r\nsight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a\r\nsnug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the\r\nthings dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or\r\nmore above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps\r\nwas out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam\r\nwe made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame\r\naround it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in\r\nsloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We\r\nmade an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get\r\nbroke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang\r\nthe old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever\r\nwe see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over;\r\nbut we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we\r\nwas in what they call a \xe2\x80\x9ccrossing\xe2\x80\x9d; for the river was pretty high yet,\r\nvery low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.\r\n\r\nThis second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\r\nthat was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,\r\nand we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of\r\nsolemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\r\nup at the stars, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t ever feel like talking loud, and it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t often that we laughed\xe2\x80\x94only a little kind of a low chuckle. We\r\nhad mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened\r\nto us at all\xe2\x80\x94that night, nor the next, nor the next.\r\n\r\nEvery night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\r\nnothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.\r\nThe fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world\r\nlit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty\r\nthousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that\r\nwonderful spread of lights at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock that still night. There\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t a sound there; everybody was asleep.\r\n\r\nEvery night now I used to slip ashore toward ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at some little\r\nvillage, and buy ten or fifteen cents\xe2\x80\x99 worth of meal or bacon or other\r\nstuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn\xe2\x80\x99t roosting\r\ncomfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when\r\nyou get a chance, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want him yourself you can easy\r\nfind somebody that does, and a good deed ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever forgot. I never see\r\npap when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used\r\nto say, anyway.\r\n\r\nMornings before daylight I slipped into corn-fields and borrowed a\r\nwatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\r\nthat kind. Pap always said it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no harm to borrow things if you\r\nwas meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\r\nJim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\r\nright; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\r\nfrom the list and say we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t borrow them any more\xe2\x80\x94then he reckoned\r\nit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all\r\none night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\r\nwhether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\r\nor what. But toward daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\r\nconcluded to drop crabapples and p\xe2\x80\x99simmons. We warn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling just\r\nright before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way\r\nit come out, too, because crabapples ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever good, and the p\xe2\x80\x99simmons\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be ripe for two or three months yet.\r\n\r\nWe shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\r\nor didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we\r\nlived pretty high.\r\n\r\nThe fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\r\na power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\r\nsheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\r\nWhen the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\r\nand high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, \xe2\x80\x9cHel-_lo_,\r\nJim, looky yonder!\xe2\x80\x9d It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a\r\nrock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her\r\nvery distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\r\nwater, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and\r\na chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of\r\nit, when the flashes come.\r\n\r\nWell, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so\r\nmysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 felt when\r\nI seen that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle\r\nof the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little,\r\nand see what there was there. So I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe\xe2\x80\x99s land on her, Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doan\xe2\x80\x99 want to go fool\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99long er no wrack. We\xe2\x80\x99s doin\xe2\x80\x99 blame\xe2\x80\x99 well,\r\nen we better let blame\xe2\x80\x99 well alone, as de good book says. Like as not\r\ndey\xe2\x80\x99s a watchman on dat wrack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatchman your grandmother,\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing to watch but\r\nthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nresk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\xe2\x80\x9d Jim\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing to that, so he didn\xe2\x80\x99t try. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides,\xe2\x80\x9d I says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe might borrow something worth having out of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s stateroom.\r\nSeegars, _I_ bet you\xe2\x80\x94and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat\r\ncaptains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.\r\nStick a candle in your pocket; I can\xe2\x80\x99t rest, Jim, till we give her a\r\nrummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not\r\nfor pie, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99d call it an adventure\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99d call\r\nit; and he\xe2\x80\x99d land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe throw style into it?\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he spread himself, nor nothing? Why,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d think it was Christopher C\xe2\x80\x99lumbus discovering Kingdom Come. I\r\nwish Tom Sawyer _was_ here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t talk any more\r\nthan we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us\r\nthe wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\r\nmade fast there.\r\n\r\nThe deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to\r\nlabboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\r\nfeet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\r\ndark we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward\r\nend of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us\r\nin front of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away\r\ndown through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second\r\nwe seem to hear low voices in yonder!\r\n\r\nJim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to\r\ncome along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but\r\njust then I heard a voice wail out and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t, boys; I swear I won\xe2\x80\x99t ever tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother voice said, pretty loud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie, Jim Turner. You\xe2\x80\x99ve acted this way before. You always want\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x99n your share of the truck, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve always got it, too, because\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve swore \xe2\x80\x99t if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x99d tell. But this time you\xe2\x80\x99ve said it\r\njest one time too many. You\xe2\x80\x99re the meanest, treacherousest hound in\r\nthis country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with\r\ncuriosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t back out now,\r\nand so I won\xe2\x80\x99t either; I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here. So I\r\ndropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\r\nin the dark till there warn\xe2\x80\x99t but one stateroom betwixt me and the\r\ncross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the\r\nfloor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\r\nof them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\r\nThis one kept pointing the pistol at the man\xe2\x80\x99s head on the floor, and\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d _like_ to! And I orter, too\xe2\x80\x94a mean skunk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t, Bill;\r\nI hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever goin\xe2\x80\x99 to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Deed you _ain\xe2\x80\x99t!_ You never said no truer thing \xe2\x80\x99n that, you bet\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d And once he said: \xe2\x80\x9cHear him beg! and yit if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got the\r\nbest of him and tied him he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 killed us both. And what _for_? Jist\r\nfor noth\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99. Jist because we stood on our _rights_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what for. But\r\nI lay you ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put\r\n_up_ that pistol, Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBill says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, Jake Packard. I\xe2\x80\x99m for killin\xe2\x80\x99 him\xe2\x80\x94and didn\xe2\x80\x99t he kill\r\nold Hatfield jist the same way\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t he deserve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t _want_ him killed, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my reasons for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless yo\xe2\x80\x99 heart for them words, Jake Packard! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forgit you\r\nlong\xe2\x80\x99s I live!\xe2\x80\x9d says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\r\n\r\nPackard didn\xe2\x80\x99t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a\r\nnail and started toward where I was, there in the dark, and motioned\r\nBill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the\r\nboat slanted so that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make very good time; so to keep from\r\ngetting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper\r\nside. The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to\r\nmy stateroom, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94come in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in\r\nthe upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there,\r\nwith their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nthem, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they\xe2\x80\x99d been having.\r\nI was glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t drink whisky; but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t made much difference\r\nanyway, because most of the time they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 treed me because\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nbreathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to\r\nkill Turner. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s said he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares\r\nto him _now_ it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference after the row and the way\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve served him. Shore\xe2\x80\x99s you\xe2\x80\x99re born, he\xe2\x80\x99ll turn state\xe2\x80\x99s evidence; now\r\nyou hear _me._ I\xe2\x80\x99m for putting him out of his troubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x99m I,\xe2\x80\x9d says Packard, very quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlame it, I\xe2\x80\x99d sorter begun to think you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Well, then, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright. Le\xe2\x80\x99s go and do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on a minute; I hain\xe2\x80\x99t had my say yit. You listen to me.\r\nShooting\xe2\x80\x99s good, but there\xe2\x80\x99s quieter ways if the things _got_ to be\r\ndone. But what _I_ say is this: it ain\xe2\x80\x99t good sense to go court\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99\r\naround after a halter if you can git at what you\xe2\x80\x99re up to in some way\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s jist as good and at the same time don\xe2\x80\x99t bring you into no resks.\r\nAin\xe2\x80\x99t that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet it is. But how you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to manage it this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my idea is this: we\xe2\x80\x99ll rustle around and gather up whatever\r\npickin\xe2\x80\x99s we\xe2\x80\x99ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and\r\nhide the truck. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait. Now I say it ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x99n two hours befo\xe2\x80\x99 this wrack breaks up and washes off down the\r\nriver. See? He\xe2\x80\x99ll be drownded, and won\xe2\x80\x99t have nobody to blame for\r\nit but his own self. I reckon that\xe2\x80\x99s a considerable sight better \xe2\x80\x99n\r\nkillin\xe2\x80\x99 of him. I\xe2\x80\x99m unfavorable to killin\xe2\x80\x99 a man as long as you can git\r\naroun\xe2\x80\x99 it; it ain\xe2\x80\x99t good sense, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t good morals. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I reck\xe2\x80\x99n you are. But s\xe2\x80\x99pose she _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ break up and wash off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then; come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled\r\nforward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cJim!\xe2\x80\x9d and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a\r\nmoan, and I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Jim, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no time for fooling around and moaning; there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngang of murderers in yonder, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t hunt up their boat and set\r\nher drifting down the river so these fellows can\xe2\x80\x99t get away from the\r\nwreck there\xe2\x80\x99s one of \xe2\x80\x99em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their\r\nboat we can put _all_ of \xe2\x80\x99em in a bad fix\xe2\x80\x94for the sheriff \xe2\x80\x99ll get \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nQuick\xe2\x80\x94hurry! I\xe2\x80\x99ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You\r\nstart at the raft, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my lordy, lordy! _Raf\xe2\x80\x99?_ Dey ain\xe2\x80\x99 no raf\xe2\x80\x99 no mo\xe2\x80\x99; she done broke\r\nloose en gone!\xe2\x80\x94en here we is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with\r\nsuch a gang as that! But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no time to be sentimentering. We\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n_got_ to find that boat now\xe2\x80\x94had to have it for ourselves. So we went\r\na-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim\r\nsaid he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe he could go any farther\xe2\x80\x94so scared he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left\r\non this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck\r\nfor the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\r\nforwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the\r\nedge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the\r\ncross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely\r\nsee her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\naboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his\r\nhead out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;\r\nbut he jerked it in again, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeave that blame lantern out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and\r\nset down. It was Packard. Then Bill _he_ come out and got in. Packard\r\nsays, in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ready\xe2\x80\x94shove off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99d you go through him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. So he\xe2\x80\x99s got his share o\xe2\x80\x99 the cash yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, won\xe2\x80\x99t he suspicion what we\xe2\x80\x99re up to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he won\xe2\x80\x99t. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they got out and went in.\r\n\r\nThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half\r\nsecond I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with my\r\nknife and cut the rope, and away we went!\r\n\r\nWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch an oar, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak nor whisper, nor hardly\r\neven breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of\r\nthe paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was\r\na hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every\r\nlast sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\r\n\r\nWhen we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern\r\nshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed\r\nby that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to\r\nunderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\r\n\r\nThen Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was\r\nthe first time that I begun to worry about the men\xe2\x80\x94I reckon I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhad time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for\r\nmurderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\ntelling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how\r\nwould I like it? So says I to Jim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first light we see we\xe2\x80\x99ll land a hundred yards below it or above\r\nit, in a place where it\xe2\x80\x99s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff,\r\nand then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to\r\ngo for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung\r\nwhen their time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,\r\nand this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light\r\nshowed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river,\r\nwatching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the\r\nrain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,\r\nand by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we\r\nmade for it.\r\n\r\nIt was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We\r\nseen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would\r\ngo for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had\r\nstole there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and\r\nI told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had\r\ngone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my\r\noars and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four\r\nmore showed\xe2\x80\x94up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the\r\nshore light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it\r\nwas a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I\r\nskimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and\r\nby and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down\r\nbetween his knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and\r\nbegun to cry.\r\n\r\nHe stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only\r\nme he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, what\xe2\x80\x99s up? Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry, bub. What\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPap, and mam, and sis, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I broke down. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dang it now, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,\r\nand this \xe2\x80\x99n \xe2\x80\x99ll come out all right. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x94are you the watchman of the boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the captain\r\nand the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head\r\ndeck-hand; and sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m the freight and passengers. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nrich as old Jim Hornback, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t be so blame\xe2\x80\x99 generous and good to\r\nTom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he\r\ndoes; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve told him a many a time \xe2\x80\x99t I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trade places with\r\nhim; for, says I, a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x99s the life for me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m derned if\r\n_I\xe2\x80\x99d_ live two mile out o\xe2\x80\x99 town, where there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing ever goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\non, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI broke in and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re in an awful peck of trouble, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Who_ is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you\xe2\x80\x99d take your\r\nferryboat and go up there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp where? Where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the wreck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat wreck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t but one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the _Walter Scott?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood land! what are they doin\xe2\x80\x99 _there_, for gracious sakes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t go there a-purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet they didn\xe2\x80\x99t! Why, great goodness, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no chance for \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nif they don\xe2\x80\x99t git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they\r\never git into such a scrape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Booth\xe2\x80\x99s Landing\xe2\x80\x94go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a-visiting there at Booth\xe2\x80\x99s Landing, and just in the edge of\r\nthe evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry\r\nto stay all night at her friend\xe2\x80\x99s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndisremember her name\xe2\x80\x94and they lost their steering-oar, and swung\r\naround and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and\r\nsaddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and\r\nthe horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard\r\nthe wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our\r\ntrading-scow, and it was so dark we didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice the wreck till we was\r\nright on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but\r\nBill Whipple\xe2\x80\x94and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!\xe2\x80\x94I most wish \xe2\x80\x99t it had\r\nbeen me, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy George! It\xe2\x80\x99s the beatenest thing I ever struck. And _then_ what did\r\nyou all do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we hollered and took on, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so wide there we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help\r\nsomehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,\r\nand Miss Hooker she said if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike help sooner, come here and\r\nhunt up her uncle, and he\xe2\x80\x99d fix the thing. I made the land about a mile\r\nbelow, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do\r\nsomething, but they said, \xe2\x80\x99What, in such a night and such a current?\r\nThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no sense in it; go for the steam-ferry.\xe2\x80\x99 Now if you\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jackson, I\xe2\x80\x99d _like_ to, and, blame it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but I will; but\r\nwho in the dingnation\xe2\x80\x99s a-going to _pay_ for it? Do you reckon your\r\npap\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ all right. Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that\r\nher uncle Hornback\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat guns! is _he_ her uncle? Looky here, you break for that light\r\nover yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a\r\nquarter of a mile out you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the tavern; tell \xe2\x80\x99em to dart you\r\nout to Jim Hornback\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll foot the bill. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you fool\r\naround any, because he\xe2\x80\x99ll want to know the news. Tell him I\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nhis niece all safe before he can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back\r\nand got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in\r\nthe easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some\r\nwood-boats; for I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat\r\nstart. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on\r\naccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it. I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged she would\r\nbe proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions\r\nand dead-beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most\r\ninterest in.\r\n\r\nWell, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along\r\ndown! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for\r\nher. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn\xe2\x80\x99t much chance\r\nfor anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered a\r\nlittle, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any answer; all dead still. I felt a little\r\nbit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they\r\ncould stand it I could.\r\n\r\nThen here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river\r\non a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach\r\nI laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the\r\nwreck for Miss Hooker\xe2\x80\x99s remainders, because the captain would know her\r\nuncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat\r\ngive it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went\r\na-booming down the river.\r\n\r\nIt did seem a powerful long time before Jim\xe2\x80\x99s light showed up; and when\r\nit did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. By the time I\r\ngot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we\r\nstruck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned\r\nin and slept like dead people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole\r\noff of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all\r\nsorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spy-glass, and three\r\nboxes of seegars. We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever been this rich before in neither of\r\nour lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the\r\nwoods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good\r\ntime. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the\r\nferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he\r\nsaid he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want no more adventures. He said that when I went in\r\nthe texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he\r\nnearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could\r\nbe fixed; for if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get saved he would get drownded; and if he\r\ndid get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get\r\nthe reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he\r\nwas right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for\r\na nigger.\r\n\r\nI read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such,\r\nand how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called\r\neach other and so on, \xe2\x80\x99stead of mister; and Jim\xe2\x80\x99s eyes bugged out, and\r\nhe was interested. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99 know dey was so many un um. I hain\xe2\x80\x99t hearn \xe2\x80\x99bout none un um,\r\nskasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat\xe2\x80\x99s in a\r\npack er k\xe2\x80\x99yards. How much do a king git?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet?\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want\r\nit; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ain\xe2\x80\x99_ dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_They_ don\xe2\x80\x99t do nothing! Why, how you talk! They just set around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; is dat so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is. They just set around\xe2\x80\x94except, maybe, when there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwar; then they go to the war. But other times they just lazy around; or\r\ngo hawking\xe2\x80\x94just hawking and sp\xe2\x80\x94 Sh!\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99you hear a noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe skipped out and looked; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing but the flutter of a\r\nsteamboat\xe2\x80\x99s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cand other times, when things is dull, they fuss with\r\nthe parlyment; and if everybody don\xe2\x80\x99t go just so he whacks their heads\r\noff. But mostly they hang round the harem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoun\xe2\x80\x99 de which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s de harem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place where he keeps his wives. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know about the harem?\r\nSolomon had one; he had about a million wives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, dat\xe2\x80\x99s so; I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d done forgot it. A harem\xe2\x80\x99s a bo\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x99n-house, I\r\nreck\xe2\x80\x99n. Mos\xe2\x80\x99 likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. En I reck\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nde wives quarrels considable; en dat \xe2\x80\x99crease de racket. Yit dey say\r\nSollermun de wises\xe2\x80\x99 man dat ever live\xe2\x80\x99. I doan\xe2\x80\x99 take no stock in\r\ndat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids\xe2\x80\x99 er sich a\r\nblim-blammin\xe2\x80\x99 all de time? No\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99deed he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. A wise man \xe2\x80\x99ud take en\r\nbuil\xe2\x80\x99 a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry when\r\nhe want to res\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told\r\nme so, her own self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doan\xe2\x80\x99 k\xe2\x80\x99yer what de widder say, he _warn\xe2\x80\x99t_ no wise man nuther. He\r\nhad some er de dad-fetchedes\xe2\x80\x99 ways I ever see. Does you know \xe2\x80\x99bout dat\r\nchile dat he \xe2\x80\x99uz gwyne to chop in two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the widow told me all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Well_, den! Warn\xe2\x80\x99 dat de beatenes\xe2\x80\x99 notion in de worl\xe2\x80\x99? You jes\xe2\x80\x99 take\r\nen look at it a minute. Dah\xe2\x80\x99s de stump, dah\xe2\x80\x94dat\xe2\x80\x99s one er de women;\r\nheah\xe2\x80\x99s you\xe2\x80\x94dat\xe2\x80\x99s de yuther one; I\xe2\x80\x99s Sollermun; en dish yer dollar\r\nbill\xe2\x80\x99s de chile.

No; I take en whack de bill in\r\n_two_, en give half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman.\r\nDat\xe2\x80\x99s de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now I want to ast\r\nyou: what\xe2\x80\x99s de use er dat half a bill?\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t buy noth\xe2\x80\x99n wid it. En what\r\nuse is a half a chile? I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 give a dern for a million un um.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut hang it, Jim, you\xe2\x80\x99ve clean missed the point\xe2\x80\x94blame it, you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmissed it a thousand mile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?

Doan\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntalk to me \xe2\x80\x99bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlame de point! I reck\xe2\x80\x99n I knows what I knows. En mine you, de _real_\r\npint furder\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s down deeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was raised.\r\nYou take a man dat\xe2\x80\x99s got on\xe2\x80\x99y one or two chillen; is dat man gwyne to\r\nbe waseful o\xe2\x80\x99 chillen? No, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t; he can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ford it. _He_ know how\r\nto value \xe2\x80\x99em. But you take a man dat\xe2\x80\x99s got \xe2\x80\x99bout five million chillen\r\nrunnin\xe2\x80\x99 roun\xe2\x80\x99 de house, en it\xe2\x80\x99s diffunt. _He_ as soon chop a chile in\r\ntwo as a cat. Dey\xe2\x80\x99s plenty mo\xe2\x80\x99. A chile er two, mo\xe2\x80\x99 er less, warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nconsekens to Sollermun, dad fetch him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, there\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t no getting it out again. He was the most down on Solomon of any\r\nnigger I ever see. So I went to talking about other kings, and let\r\nSolomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off\r\nin France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some\r\nsay he died there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPo\xe2\x80\x99 little chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut some says he got out and got away, and come to America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDat\xe2\x80\x99s good! But he\xe2\x80\x99ll be pooty lonesome\xe2\x80\x94dey ain\xe2\x80\x99 no kings here, is\r\ndey, Huck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen he cain\xe2\x80\x99t git no situation. What he gwyne to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them\r\nlearns people how to talk French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Huck, doan\xe2\x80\x99 de French people talk de same way we does?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_No_, Jim; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand a word they said\xe2\x80\x94not a single word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but it\xe2\x80\x99s so.

We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the\r\nOhio amongst the free states, and then be out of trouble.\r\n\r\nWell, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a\r\ntowhead to tie to, for it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to try to run in a fog; but\r\nwhen I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t anything but little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around\r\none of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff\r\ncurrent, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by\r\nthe roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me\r\nso sick and scared I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge for most a half a minute it seemed\r\nto me\xe2\x80\x94and then there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no raft in sight; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see twenty\r\nyards. I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed\r\nthe paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t come. I was in\r\nsuch a hurry I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but\r\nI was so excited my hands shook so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly do anything with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy,\r\nright down the towhead. That was all right as far as it went, but the\r\ntowhead warn\xe2\x80\x99t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of\r\nit I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no more idea which\r\nway I was going than a dead man.\r\n\r\nThinks I, it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to paddle; first I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll run into the bank\r\nor a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a\r\ntime. I whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears\r\na small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it,\r\nlistening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come I see I warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nheading for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time\r\nI was heading away to the left of it\xe2\x80\x94and not gaining on it much either,\r\nfor I was flying around, this way and that and t\xe2\x80\x99other, but it was\r\ngoing straight ahead all the time.\r\n\r\nI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all\r\nthe time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the\r\nwhoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and\r\ndirectly I hears the whoop _behind_ me. I was tangled good now. That\r\nwas somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s whoop, or else I was turned around.\r\n\r\nI throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me\r\nyet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its\r\nplace, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me\r\nagain, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe\xe2\x80\x99s head down-stream,\r\nand I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman\r\nhollering. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.\r\n\r\nThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a\r\ncut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed\r\nme off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly\r\nroared, the current was tearing by them so swift.\r\n\r\nIn another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set\r\nperfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.\r\n\r\nI just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an\r\nisland, and Jim had gone down t\xe2\x80\x99other side of it. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t no towhead\r\nthat you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a\r\nregular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a\r\nmile wide.\r\n\r\nI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.\r\nI was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ever think of that. No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still\r\non the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink to yourself how fast _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ going, but you catch your breath\r\nand think, my! how that snag\xe2\x80\x99s tearing along. If you think it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you\r\ntry it once\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\r\n\r\nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears\r\nthe answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo it, and directly I judged I\xe2\x80\x99d got into a nest of towheads, for I\r\nhad little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me\xe2\x80\x94sometimes just a\r\nnarrow channel between, and some that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see I knowed was there\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and\r\ntrash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn\xe2\x80\x99t long loosing the whoops\r\ndown amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little\r\nwhile, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o\xe2\x80\x99-lantern. You\r\nnever knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to\r\nkeep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the\r\nraft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would\r\nget further ahead and clear out of hearing\xe2\x80\x94it was floating a little\r\nfaster than what I was.\r\n\r\nWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a\r\nsnag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I\r\nlaid down in the canoe and said I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother no more. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it;\r\nso I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.\r\n\r\nBut I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars\r\nwas shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a\r\nbig bend stern first. First I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where I was; I thought I was\r\ndreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come\r\nup dim out of last week.\r\n\r\nIt was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest\r\nkind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see\r\nby the stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the\r\nwater. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing but a\r\ncouple of saw-logs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and\r\nchased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his\r\nknees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. The\r\nother oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and\r\nbranches and dirt. So she\xe2\x80\x99d had a rough time.\r\n\r\nI made fast and laid down under Jim\xe2\x80\x99s nose on the raft, and began to\r\ngap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you stir me up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain\xe2\x80\x99 dead\xe2\x80\x94you ain\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndrownded\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99s back ag\xe2\x80\x99in? It\xe2\x80\x99s too good for true, honey, it\xe2\x80\x99s too good\r\nfor true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o\xe2\x80\x99 you. No, you ain\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndead! you\xe2\x80\x99s back ag\xe2\x80\x99in, \xe2\x80\x99live en soun\xe2\x80\x99, jis de same ole Huck\xe2\x80\x94de same\r\nole Huck, thanks to goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrinkin\xe2\x80\x99? Has I ben a-drinkin\xe2\x80\x99? Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what makes you talk so wild?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does I talk wild?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_How?_ Why, hain\xe2\x80\x99t you been talking about my coming back, and all that\r\nstuff, as if I\xe2\x80\x99d been gone away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck\xe2\x80\x94Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. _Hain\xe2\x80\x99t_ you\r\nben gone away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? _I_ hain\xe2\x80\x99t been gone\r\nanywheres. Where would I go to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, looky here, boss, dey\xe2\x80\x99s sumfn wrong, dey is. Is I _me_, or who\r\n_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I? Now dat\xe2\x80\x99s what I wants to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re here, plain enough, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\ntangle-headed old fool, Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI is, is I? Well, you answer me dis: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tote out de line in de\r\ncanoe fer to make fas\xe2\x80\x99 to de towhead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. What towhead? I hain\xe2\x80\x99t seen no towhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hain\xe2\x80\x99t seen no towhead? Looky here, didn\xe2\x80\x99t de line pull loose en\r\nde raf\xe2\x80\x99 go a-hummin\xe2\x80\x99 down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in\r\nde fog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _de_ fog!\xe2\x80\x94de fog dat\xe2\x80\x99s been aroun\xe2\x80\x99 all night. En didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nwhoop, en didn\xe2\x80\x99t I whoop, tell we got mix\xe2\x80\x99 up in de islands en one un\r\nus got los\xe2\x80\x99 en t\xe2\x80\x99other one was jis\xe2\x80\x99 as good as los\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x99kase he didn\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknow whah he wuz? En didn\xe2\x80\x99t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have\r\na turrible time en mos\xe2\x80\x99 git drownded? Now ain\xe2\x80\x99 dat so, boss\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nso? You answer me dat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain\xe2\x80\x99t seen no fog, nor no\r\nislands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. I been setting here talking\r\nwith you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I\r\nreckon I done the same. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got drunk in that time, so of\r\ncourse you\xe2\x80\x99ve been dreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn\xe2\x80\x99t any of it\r\nhappen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Huck, it\xe2\x80\x99s all jis\xe2\x80\x99 as plain to me as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference how plain it is; there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing in\r\nit. I know, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim didn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying\r\nover it. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, den, I reck\xe2\x80\x99n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nde powerfulest dream I ever see. En I hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever had no dream b\xe2\x80\x99fo\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndat\xe2\x80\x99s tired me like dis one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right, because a dream does tire a body like\r\neverything sometimes. But this one was a staving dream; tell me all\r\nabout it, Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as\r\nit happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must\r\nstart in and \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99terpret\xe2\x80\x9d it, because it was sent for a warning. He said\r\nthe first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good,\r\nbut the current was another man that would get us away from him. The\r\nwhoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if\r\nwe didn\xe2\x80\x99t try hard to make out to understand them they\xe2\x80\x99d just take us\r\ninto bad luck, \xe2\x80\x99stead of keeping us out of it. The lot of towheads was\r\ntroubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds\r\nof mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk back and\r\naggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into\r\nthe big clear river, which was the free states, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have no\r\nmore trouble.\r\n\r\nIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it\r\nwas clearing up again now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI says; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what does _these_ things stand for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. You\r\ncould see them first-rate now.\r\n\r\nJim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash\r\nagain. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place\r\nagain right away. But when he did get the thing straightened around he\r\nlooked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do dey stan\xe2\x80\x99 for? I\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore out\r\nwid work, en wid de callin\xe2\x80\x99 for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz\r\nmos\xe2\x80\x99 broke bekase you wuz los\xe2\x80\x99, en I didn\xe2\x80\x99 k\xe2\x80\x99yer no\xe2\x80\x99 mo\xe2\x80\x99 what become er\r\nme en de raf\xe2\x80\x99. En when I wake up en fine you back ag\xe2\x80\x99in, all safe en\r\nsoun\xe2\x80\x99, de tears come, en I could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got down on my knees en kiss yo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfoot, I\xe2\x80\x99s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99bout wuz how you could\r\nmake a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash\r\nis what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren\xe2\x80\x99s en makes \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without\r\nsaying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel so mean\r\nI could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.\r\n\r\nIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble\r\nmyself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever sorry for it\r\nafterward, neither. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndone that one if I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 knowed it would make him feel that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind\r\na monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She\r\nhad four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as\r\nthirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an\r\nopen camp-fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There\r\nwas a power of style about her. It _amounted_ to something being a\r\nraftsman on such a craft as that.\r\n\r\nWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and\r\ngot hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\r\nboth sides; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We\r\ntalked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got\r\nto it. I said likely we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, because I had heard say there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbut about a dozen houses there, and if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to have them\r\nlit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if\r\nthe two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said\r\nmaybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming\r\ninto the same old river again. That disturbed Jim\xe2\x80\x94and me too. So the\r\nquestion was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light\r\nshowed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow,\r\nand was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was\r\nto Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\nThere warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and\r\nnot pass it without seeing it. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d be mighty sure to see it,\r\nbecause he\xe2\x80\x99d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every\r\nlittle while he jumps up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDah she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it warn\xe2\x80\x99t. It was Jack-o\xe2\x80\x99-lanterns, or lightning-bugs; so he set\r\ndown again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him\r\nall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can\r\ntell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,\r\nbecause I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwho was to blame for it? Why, _me_. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get that out of my\r\nconscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrest; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay still in one place. It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever come home to\r\nme before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it\r\nstayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to\r\nmyself that _I_ warn\xe2\x80\x99t to blame, because _I_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t run Jim off from\r\nhis rightful owner; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use, conscience up and says, every\r\ntime, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99\r\npaddled ashore and told somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d That was so\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get around\r\nthat no way. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhad poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off\r\nright under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor\r\nold woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to\r\nlearn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to\r\nbe good to you every way she knowed how. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ what she done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.\r\nI fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim\r\nwas fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still.\r\nEvery time he danced around and says, \xe2\x80\x9cDah\xe2\x80\x99s Cairo!\xe2\x80\x9d it went through me\r\nlike a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of\r\nmiserableness.\r\n\r\nJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was\r\nsaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he\r\nwould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when\r\nhe got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close\r\nto where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the\r\ntwo children, and if their master wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell them, they\xe2\x80\x99d get an\r\nAb\xe2\x80\x99litionist to go and steal them.\r\n\r\nIt most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever dared to talk such\r\ntalk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the\r\nminute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive a nigger an inch and he\xe2\x80\x99ll take an ell.\xe2\x80\x9d Thinks I, this is what\r\ncomes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good as\r\nhelped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would\r\nsteal his children\xe2\x80\x94children that belonged to a man I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know;\r\na man that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever done me no harm.\r\n\r\nI was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My\r\nconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says\r\nto it, \xe2\x80\x9cLet up on me\xe2\x80\x94it ain\xe2\x80\x99t too late yet\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll paddle ashore at the\r\nfirst light and tell.\xe2\x80\x9d I felt easy and happy and light as a feather\r\nright off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a\r\nlight, and sort of singing to myself. By and by one showed. Jim sings\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99s safe, Huck, we\xe2\x80\x99s safe! Jump up and crack yo\xe2\x80\x99 heels! Dat\xe2\x80\x99s de good\r\nole Cairo at las\xe2\x80\x99, I jis knows it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom\r\nfor me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooty soon I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a-shout\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 for joy, en I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, it\xe2\x80\x99s all on\r\naccounts o\xe2\x80\x99 Huck; I\xe2\x80\x99s a free man, en I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever ben free ef it\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99 ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won\xe2\x80\x99t ever forgit you, Huck;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99s de bes\xe2\x80\x99 fren\xe2\x80\x99 Jim\xe2\x80\x99s ever had; en you\xe2\x80\x99s de _only_ fren\xe2\x80\x99 ole Jim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says\r\nthis, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along\r\nslow then, and I warn\xe2\x80\x99t right down certain whether I was glad I started\r\nor whether I warn\xe2\x80\x99t. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on\xe2\x80\x99y white genlman dat ever kep\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhis promise to ole Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, I just felt sick. But I says, I _got_ to do it\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t get _out_\r\nof it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and\r\nthey stopped and I stopped. One of them says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA piece of a raft,\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you belong on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny men on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head\r\nof the bend. Is your man white or black?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come. I\r\ntried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn\xe2\x80\x99t man\r\nenough\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just\r\ngive up trying, and up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon we\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see for ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s pap that\xe2\x80\x99s there, and maybe\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He\xe2\x80\x99s sick\xe2\x80\x94and so\r\nis mam and Mary Ann.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the devil! we\xe2\x80\x99re in a hurry, boy. But I s\xe2\x80\x99pose we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to. Come,\r\nbuckle to your paddle, and let\xe2\x80\x99s get along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a\r\nstroke or two, I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPap \xe2\x80\x99ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes\r\naway when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it\r\nby myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with\r\nyour father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94well, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stopped pulling. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t but a mighty little ways to the raft\r\nnow. One says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lie. What _is_ the matter with your pap? Answer up\r\nsquare now, and it \xe2\x80\x99ll be the better for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, sir, I will, honest\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t leave us, please. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94\r\nGentlemen, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the\r\nheadline, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to come a-near the raft\xe2\x80\x94please do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet her back, John, set her back!\xe2\x80\x9d says one. They backed water. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep\r\naway, boy\xe2\x80\x94keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has\r\nblowed it to us. Your pap\xe2\x80\x99s got the smallpox, and you know it precious\r\nwell. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all\r\nover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, a-blubbering, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told everybody before, and they\r\njust went away and left us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor devil, there\xe2\x80\x99s something in that. We are right down sorry for\r\nyou, but we\xe2\x80\x94well, hang it, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want the smallpox, you see. Look\r\nhere, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what to do. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you try to land by yourself, or\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty\r\nmiles, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It\r\nwill be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them\r\nyour folks are all down with chills and fever. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool again,\r\nand let people guess what is the matter. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do you a\r\nkindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy.\r\nIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do any good to land yonder where the light is\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only a\r\nwood-yard. Say, I reckon your father\xe2\x80\x99s poor, and I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin pretty hard luck. Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this\r\nboard, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave\r\nyou; but my kingdom! it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to fool with smallpox, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on, Parker,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a twenty to put on the board\r\nfor me. Good-by, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be all\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so, my boy\xe2\x80\x94good-by, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers\r\nyou get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says I; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t let no runaway niggers get by me if I\r\ncan help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because\r\nI knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use for me\r\nto try to learn to do right; a body that don\xe2\x80\x99t get _started_ right when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s little ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no show\xe2\x80\x94when the pinch comes there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing\r\nto back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I\r\nthought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s\xe2\x80\x99pose you\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done\r\nright and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? No,\r\nsays I, I\xe2\x80\x99d feel bad\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d feel just the same way I do now. Well, then,\r\nsays I, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use you learning to do right when it\xe2\x80\x99s troublesome\r\nto do right and ain\xe2\x80\x99t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the\r\nsame? I was stuck. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come\r\nhandiest at the time.\r\n\r\nI went into the wigwam; Jim warn\xe2\x80\x99t there. I looked all around; he\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t anywhere. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I is, Huck. Is dey out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight yit? Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk loud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told\r\nhim they were out of sight, so he come aboard. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a-listenin\xe2\x80\x99 to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was\r\ngwyne to shove for sho\xe2\x80\x99 if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to\r\nde raf\xe2\x80\x99 agin when dey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool \xe2\x80\x99em, Huck!\r\nDat _wuz_ de smartes\xe2\x80\x99 dodge! I tell you, chile, I \xe2\x80\x99spec it save\xe2\x80\x99 ole\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x94ole Jim ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to forgit you for dat, honey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise\xe2\x80\x94twenty\r\ndollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat\r\nnow, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free\r\nstates. He said twenty mile more warn\xe2\x80\x99t far for the raft to go, but he\r\nwished we was already there.\r\n\r\nTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding\r\nthe raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and\r\ngetting all ready to quit rafting.\r\n\r\nThat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down\r\nin a left-hand bend.\r\n\r\nI went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out\r\nin the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMister, is that town Cairo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCairo? no. You must be a blame\xe2\x80\x99 fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat town is it, mister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin\xe2\x80\x99\r\naround me for about a half a minute longer you\xe2\x80\x99ll get something you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never\r\nmind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.\r\n\r\nWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but\r\nit was high ground, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim\r\nsaid. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable\r\nclose to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did\r\nJim. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoan\xe2\x80\x99 le\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it, Huck. Po\xe2\x80\x99 niggers can\xe2\x80\x99t have no luck. I\r\nawluz \xe2\x80\x99spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn\xe2\x80\x99t done wid its work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen that snake-skin, Jim\xe2\x80\x94I do wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never laid\r\neyes on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t yo\xe2\x80\x99 fault, Huck; you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you blame yo\xe2\x80\x99self\r\n\xe2\x80\x99bout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure\r\nenough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with\r\nCairo.\r\n\r\nWe talked it all over. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to take to the shore; we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake the raft up the stream, of course. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t no way but to wait\r\nfor dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept\r\nall day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,\r\nand when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!\r\n\r\nWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word for a good while. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to say. We\r\nboth knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin;\r\nso what was the use to talk about it? It would only look like we was\r\nfinding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck\xe2\x80\x94and keep\r\non fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.\r\n\r\nBy and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy\r\na canoe to go back in. We warn\xe2\x80\x99t going to borrow it when there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after\r\nus.\r\n\r\nSo we shoved out after dark on the raft.\r\n\r\nAnybody that don\xe2\x80\x99t believe yet that it\xe2\x80\x99s foolishness to handle a\r\nsnake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it\r\nnow if they read on and see what more it done for us.\r\n\r\nThe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and\r\nmore. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next\r\nmeanest thing to fog. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell the shape of the river, and you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\r\ncomes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she\r\nwould see it. Up-stream boats didn\xe2\x80\x99t generly come close to us; they go\r\nout and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but\r\nnights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.\r\n\r\nWe could hear her pounding along, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her good till she\r\nwas close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see\r\nhow close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\r\na sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\r\ntry and shave us; but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be sheering off a bit. She was\r\na big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\r\ncloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged\r\nout, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\r\nlike red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\r\nover us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\r\nengines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam\xe2\x80\x94and as Jim went\r\noverboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight\r\nthrough the raft.\r\n\r\nI dived\xe2\x80\x94and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel\r\nhad got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could\r\nalways stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\r\nminute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\r\nnearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\r\nmy nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and\r\nof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\r\nstopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\r\nchurning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though\r\nI could hear her.\r\n\r\nI sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any answer;\r\nso I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was \xe2\x80\x9ctreading water,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nstruck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see\r\nthat the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\r\nmeant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\r\n\r\nIt was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\r\nlong time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\r\nbank. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\r\nrough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\r\nbig old-fashioned double log house before I noticed it. I was going to\r\nrush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling\r\nand barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his\r\nhead out, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe done, boys! Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Jackson, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want nothing, sir. I only want to go along by, but the dogs\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you prowling around here this time of night for\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warn\xe2\x80\x99t prowling around, sir; I fell overboard off of the steamboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What did you say\r\nyour name was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Jackson, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m only a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, if you\xe2\x80\x99re telling the truth you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid\xe2\x80\x94nobody\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ll hurt you. But don\xe2\x80\x99t try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse\r\nout Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is\r\nthere anybody with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.\r\nThe man sung out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t you got any sense?\r\nPut it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are\r\nready, take your places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; I never heard of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that may be so, and it mayn\xe2\x80\x99t. Now, all ready. Step forward,\r\nGeorge Jackson. And mind, don\xe2\x80\x99t you hurry\xe2\x80\x94come mighty slow. If there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanybody with you, let him keep back\xe2\x80\x94if he shows himself he\xe2\x80\x99ll be shot.\r\nCome along now. Come slow; push the door open yourself\xe2\x80\x94just enough to\r\nsqueeze in, d\xe2\x80\x99you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurry; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t if I\xe2\x80\x99d a-wanted to. I took one slow step at\r\na time and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.\r\nThe dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind\r\nme. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and\r\nunbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a\r\nlittle and a little more till somebody said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough\xe2\x80\x94put\r\nyour head in.\xe2\x80\x9d I done it, but I judged they would take it off.\r\n\r\nThe candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me,\r\nand me at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with\r\nguns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray\r\nand about sixty, the other two thirty or more\xe2\x80\x94all of them fine and\r\nhandsome\xe2\x80\x94and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two\r\nyoung women which I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see right well. The old gentleman says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere; I reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it\r\nand bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and\r\nthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,\r\nand got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front\r\nwindows\xe2\x80\x94there warn\xe2\x80\x99t none on the side. They held the candle, and took\r\na good look at me, and all said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _he_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t a Shepherdson\xe2\x80\x94no,\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t any Shepherdson about him.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the old man said he hoped\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being searched for arms, because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm\r\nby it\xe2\x80\x94it was only to make sure. So he didn\xe2\x80\x99t pry into my pockets, but\r\nonly felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me\r\nto make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old\r\nlady says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless you, Saul, the poor thing\xe2\x80\x99s as wet as he can be; and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou reckon it may be he\xe2\x80\x99s hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue for you, Rachel\xe2\x80\x94I forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the old lady says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetsy\xe2\x80\x9d (this was a nigger woman), \xe2\x80\x9cyou fly around and get him\r\nsomething to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls\r\ngo and wake up Buck and tell him\xe2\x80\x94oh, here he is himself. Buck, take\r\nthis little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him\r\nup in some of yours that\xe2\x80\x99s dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBuck looked about as old as me\xe2\x80\x94thirteen or fourteen or along there,\r\nthough he was a little bigger than me. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t on anything but a\r\nshirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one\r\nfist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t they no Shepherdsons around?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey said, no, \xe2\x80\x99twas a false alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cif they\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 ben some, I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all laughed, and Bob says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been so slow in\r\ncoming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, nobody come after me, and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t right. I\xe2\x80\x99m always kept down;\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t get no show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Buck, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have show enough,\r\nall in good time, don\xe2\x80\x99t you fret about that. Go \xe2\x80\x99long with you now, and\r\ndo as your mother told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a\r\nroundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he\r\nasked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to\r\ntell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods\r\nday before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle\r\nwent out. I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard about it before, no way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, guess,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99m I going to guess,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I never heard tell of it\r\nbefore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can guess, can\xe2\x80\x99t you? It\xe2\x80\x99s just as easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Which_ candle?\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, any candle,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he was,\xe2\x80\x9d says I; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere was he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he was in the _dark!_ That\xe2\x80\x99s where he was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, blame it, it\xe2\x80\x99s a riddle, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Say, how long are you\r\ngoing to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94they don\xe2\x80\x99t have no school now. Do you own a dog? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\ndog\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do\r\nyou like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter put \xe2\x80\x99em on, but I\xe2\x80\x99d ruther not, it\xe2\x80\x99s so warm. Are you all ready?\r\nAll right. Come along, old hoss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk\xe2\x80\x94that is what they\r\nhad for me down there, and there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing better that ever I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncome across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,\r\nexcept the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.\r\nThey all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had\r\nquilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me\r\nquestions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living\r\non a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann\r\nrun off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went\r\nto hunt them and he warn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,\r\nand then there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just\r\ntrimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died\r\nI took what there was left, because the farm didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to us, and\r\nstarted up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was\r\nhow I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long\r\nas I wanted it. Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed,\r\nand I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat\r\nit all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour\r\ntrying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you spell, Buck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet you can\xe2\x80\x99t spell my name,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet you what you dare I can,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cgo ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cG-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n\xe2\x80\x94there now,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou done it, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you could. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nslouch of a name to spell\xe2\x80\x94right off without studying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it\r\nnext, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was\r\nused to it.\r\n\r\nIt was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so\r\nmuch style. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a\r\nwooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same\r\nas houses in town. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a\r\nbed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big\r\nfireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean\r\nand red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick;\r\nsometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call\r\nSpanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons\r\nthat could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the\r\nmantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of\r\nthe glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun,\r\nand you could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to\r\nhear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been\r\nalong and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start\r\nin and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. They\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t took any money for her.\r\n\r\nWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\r\nmade out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the\r\nparrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;\r\nand when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t open\r\ntheir mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through\r\nunderneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\r\nbehind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\r\nof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\r\ngrapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\r\nthan real ones is, but they warn\xe2\x80\x99t real because you could see where\r\npieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it\r\nwas, underneath.\r\n\r\nThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\r\nblue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It\r\ncome all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books,\r\ntoo, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a\r\nbig family Bible full of pictures. One was _Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Progress_, about\r\na man that left his family, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t say why. I read considerable in\r\nit now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another\r\nwas _Friendship\xe2\x80\x99s Offering_, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay\xe2\x80\x99s Speeches, and another\r\nwas Dr. Gunn\xe2\x80\x99s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do\r\nif a body was sick or dead. There was a hymn-book, and a lot of other\r\nbooks. And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\r\n\r\nThey had pictures hung on the walls\xe2\x80\x94mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\r\nand battles, and Highland Marys, and one called \xe2\x80\x9cSigning the\r\nDeclaration.\xe2\x80\x9d There was some that they called crayons, which one of\r\nthe daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\r\nfifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black\r\ndress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\r\nthe middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\r\na black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\r\nvery wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive\r\non a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her\r\nother hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a\r\nreticule, and underneath the picture it said \xe2\x80\x9cShall I Never See Thee\r\nMore Alas.\xe2\x80\x9d Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up\r\nstraight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb\r\nlike a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a\r\ndead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and\r\nunderneath the picture it said \xe2\x80\x9cI Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup\r\nMore Alas.\xe2\x80\x9d There was one where a young lady was at a window looking\r\nup at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open\r\nletter in one hand with black sealing-wax showing on one edge of it,\r\nand she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and\r\nunderneath the picture it said \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone\r\nAlas.\xe2\x80\x9d These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t somehow\r\nseem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always\r\ngive me the fantods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had\r\nlaid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by\r\nwhat she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her\r\ndisposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at\r\nwork on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick,\r\nand every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live\r\ntill she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of\r\na young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge\r\nall ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking\r\nup to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two\r\narms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front,\r\nand two more reaching up toward the moon\xe2\x80\x94and the idea was to see which\r\npair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as\r\nI was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they\r\nkept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time\r\nher birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with\r\na little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice\r\nsweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery,\r\nseemed to me.\r\n\r\nThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\r\nobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of\r\nthe _Presbyterian Observer_, and write poetry after them out of her own\r\nhead. It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by\r\nthe name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\r\n\r\nODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC\xe2\x80\x99D\r\n\r\n    And did young Stephen sicken,\r\n    And did young Stephen die?\r\n    And did the sad hearts thicken,\r\n    And did the mourners cry?\r\n\r\n    No; such was not the fate of\r\n    Young Stephen Dowling Bots;\r\n    Though sad hearts round him thickened,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x99Twas not from sickness\xe2\x80\x99 shots.\r\n\r\n    No whooping-cough did rack his frame,\r\n    Nor measles drear with spots;\r\n    Not these impaired the sacred name\r\n    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.\r\n\r\n    Despised love struck not with woe\r\n    That head of curly knots,\r\n    Nor stomach troubles laid him low,\r\n    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.\r\n\r\n    O no. Then list with tearful eye,\r\n    Whilst I his fate do tell.\r\n    His soul did from this cold world fly\r\n    By falling down a well.\r\n\r\n    They got him out and emptied him;\r\n    Alas it was too late;\r\n    His spirit was gone for to sport aloft\r\n    In the realms of the good and great.\r\n\r\nIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was\r\nfourteen, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no telling what she could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done by and by.\r\nBuck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nhave to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and\r\nslap down another one, and go ahead. She warn\xe2\x80\x99t particular; she could\r\nwrite about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it\r\nwas sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died,\r\nshe would be on hand with her \xe2\x80\x9ctribute\xe2\x80\x9d before he was cold. She called\r\nthem tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then\r\nEmmeline, then the undertaker\xe2\x80\x94the undertaker never got in ahead of\r\nEmmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s name, which was Whistler. She warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever the same after\r\nthat; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live\r\nlong. Poor thing, many\xe2\x80\x99s the time I made myself go up to the little\r\nroom that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read\r\nin it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on\r\nher a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngoing to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about\r\nall the dead people when she was alive, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right that\r\nthere warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I\r\ntried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make\r\nit go somehow. They kept Emmeline\xe2\x80\x99s room trim and nice, and all the\r\nthings fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was\r\nalive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room\r\nherself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a\r\ngood deal and read her Bible there mostly.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains\r\non the windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with\r\nvines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was a\r\nlittle old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing\r\nwas ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Link is\r\nBroken\xe2\x80\x9d and play \xe2\x80\x9cThe Battle of Prague\xe2\x80\x9d on it. The walls of all the\r\nrooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole\r\nhouse was whitewashed on the outside.\r\n\r\nIt was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed\r\nand floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of\r\nthe day, and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nbetter. And warn\xe2\x80\x99t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCol. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over;\r\nand so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said,\r\nand nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our\r\ntown; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn\xe2\x80\x99t no more quality\r\nthan a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim,\r\nand had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres;\r\nhe was clean-shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had\r\nthe thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a\r\nhigh nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\r\ndeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\r\nyou, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was gray and\r\nstraight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\r\nevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from\r\nhead to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at\r\nit; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.\r\nHe carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nfrivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever loud. He was\r\nas kind as he could be\xe2\x80\x94you could feel that, you know, and so you had\r\nconfidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\r\nstraightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\r\nflicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\r\nand find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t ever have to\r\ntell anybody to mind their manners\xe2\x80\x94everybody was always good-mannered\r\nwhere he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\r\nmost always\xe2\x80\x94I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned\r\ninto a cloud-bank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\r\nenough; there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing go wrong again for a week.\r\n\r\nWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got\r\nup out of their chairs and give them good day, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t set down\r\nagain till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard\r\nwhere the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to\r\nhim, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom\xe2\x80\x99s and Bob\xe2\x80\x99s was\r\nmixed, and then they bowed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur duty to you, sir, and madam\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so\r\nthey drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on\r\nthe sugar and the mite of whisky or apple-brandy in the bottom of their\r\ntumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nBob was the oldest and Tom next\xe2\x80\x94tall, beautiful men with very broad\r\nshoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They\r\ndressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and\r\nwore broad Panama hats.\r\n\r\nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud\r\nand grand, but as good as she could be when she warn\xe2\x80\x99t stirred up; but\r\nwhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,\r\nlike her father. She was beautiful.\r\n\r\nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was\r\ngentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\r\n\r\nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them\xe2\x80\x94Buck too. My nigger\r\nhad a monstrous easy time, because I warn\xe2\x80\x99t used to having anybody do\r\nanything for me, but Buck\xe2\x80\x99s was on the jump most of the time.\r\n\r\nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\r\nSometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten\r\nor fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such\r\njunketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the\r\nwoods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly\r\nkinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a\r\nhandsome lot of quality, I tell you.\r\n\r\nThere was another clan of aristocracy around there\xe2\x80\x94five or six\r\nfamilies\xe2\x80\x94mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned\r\nand well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The\r\nShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat-landing, which\r\nwas about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there\r\nwith a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there\r\non their fine horses.\r\n\r\nOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a\r\nhorse coming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick! Jump for the woods!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty\r\nsoon a splendid young man came galloping down the road, setting his\r\nhorse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his\r\npommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard\r\nBuck\xe2\x80\x99s gun go off at my ear, and Harney\xe2\x80\x99s hat tumbled off from his\r\nhead. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was\r\nhid. But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait. We started through the woods on a run. The\r\nwoods warn\xe2\x80\x99t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,\r\nand twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away\r\nthe way he come\xe2\x80\x94to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see. We never\r\nstopped running till we got home. The old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes blazed a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twas pleasure, mainly, I judged\xe2\x80\x94then his face sort of smoothed\r\ndown, and he says, kind of gentle:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you step\r\ninto the road, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Shepherdsons don\xe2\x80\x99t, father. They always take advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling\r\nhis tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young\r\nmen looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale,\r\nbut the color come back when she found the man warn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt.\r\n\r\nSoon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by\r\nourselves, I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you want to kill him, Buck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I bet I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he do to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim? He never done nothing to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what did you want to kill him for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nothing\xe2\x80\x94only it\xe2\x80\x99s on account of the feud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a feud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where was you raised? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know what a feud is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever heard of it before\xe2\x80\x94tell me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Buck, \xe2\x80\x9ca feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with\r\nanother man, and kills him; then that other man\xe2\x80\x99s brother kills _him_;\r\nthen the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\r\n_cousins_ chip in\xe2\x80\x94and by and by everybody\xe2\x80\x99s killed off, and there ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno more feud. But it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of slow, and takes a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas this one been going on long, Buck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should _reckon!_ It started thirty year ago, or som\xe2\x80\x99ers along\r\nthere. There was trouble \xe2\x80\x99bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle\r\nit; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the\r\nman that won the suit\xe2\x80\x94which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody\r\nwould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the trouble about, Buck?\xe2\x80\x94land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon maybe\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, how do _I_ know? It was so long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t anybody know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t know now what the row was about in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas there been many killed, Buck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t always kill. Pa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot a few buckshot in him; but he don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it \xe2\x80\x99cuz he don\xe2\x80\x99t weigh\r\nmuch, anyway. Bob\xe2\x80\x99s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nhurt once or twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anybody been killed this year, Buck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; we got one and they got one. \xe2\x80\x99Bout three months ago my cousin\r\nBud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t\xe2\x80\x99other side\r\nof the river, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no weapon with him, which was blame\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfoolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind\r\nhim, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin\xe2\x80\x99 after him with his gun in\r\nhis hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and \xe2\x80\x99stead of jumping\r\noff and taking to the brush, Bud \xe2\x80\x99lowed he could outrun him; so they\r\nhad it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all\r\nthe time; so at last Bud seen it warn\xe2\x80\x99t any use, so he stopped and\r\nfaced around so as to have the bullet-holes in front, you know, and the\r\nold man he rode up and shot him down. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t git much chance to\r\nenjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon he _warn\xe2\x80\x99t_ a coward. Not by a blame\xe2\x80\x99 sight. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ncoward amongst them Shepherdsons\xe2\x80\x94not a one. And there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no cowards\r\namongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep\xe2\x80\x99 up his end\r\nin a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and\r\ncome out winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and\r\ngot behind a little woodpile, and kep\xe2\x80\x99 his horse before him to stop\r\nthe bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered\r\naround the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at\r\nthem. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but\r\nthe Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home\xe2\x80\x94and one of \xe2\x80\x99em was dead, and\r\nanother died the next day. No, sir; if a body\xe2\x80\x99s out hunting for cowards\r\nhe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t breed any of that _kind_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody\r\na-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept\r\nthem between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The\r\nShepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching\xe2\x80\x94all about\r\nbrotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was\r\na good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such\r\na powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\r\npreforeordestination, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all, that it did seem to me\r\nto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their\r\nchairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and\r\na dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went\r\nup to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that\r\nsweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and\r\nshe took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I\r\nliked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something\r\nfor her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nforgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two\r\nother books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to\r\nher, and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and\r\nslipped off up the road, and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody at the church, except\r\nmaybe a hog or two, for there warn\xe2\x80\x99t any lock on the door, and hogs\r\nlikes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it\xe2\x80\x99s cool. If you notice,\r\nmost folks don\xe2\x80\x99t go to church only when they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to; but a hog is\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nSays I to myself, something\xe2\x80\x99s up; it ain\xe2\x80\x99t natural for a girl to be in\r\nsuch a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops\r\na little piece of paper with \xe2\x80\x9c_Half past two_\xe2\x80\x9d wrote on it with a\r\npencil. I ransacked it, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything else. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again,\r\nand when I got home and up-stairs there was Miss Sophia in her door\r\nwaiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked\r\nin the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read\r\nit she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and\r\ngive me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not\r\nto tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her\r\neyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal\r\nastonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was\r\nabout, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked\r\nme if I could read writing, and I told her \xe2\x80\x9cno, only coarse-hand,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen she said the paper warn\xe2\x80\x99t anything but a book-mark to keep her\r\nplace, and I might go and play now.\r\n\r\nI went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon\r\nI noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out of\r\nsight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\r\na-running, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Jawge, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll come down into de swamp I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you a whole\r\nstack o\xe2\x80\x99 water-moccasins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThinks I, that\xe2\x80\x99s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter\r\nknow a body don\xe2\x80\x99t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for\r\nthem. What is he up to, anyway? So I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; trot ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\r\nankle-deep as much as another half-mile. We come to a little flat piece\r\nof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,\r\nand he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah\xe2\x80\x99s whah dey\r\nis. I\xe2\x80\x99s seed \xe2\x80\x99m befo\xe2\x80\x99; I don\xe2\x80\x99t k\xe2\x80\x99yer to see \xe2\x80\x99em no mo\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees\r\nhid him. I poked into the place a ways and come to a little open patch\r\nas big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying\r\nthere asleep\xe2\x80\x94and, by jings, it was my old Jim!\r\n\r\nI waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to\r\nhim to see me again, but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t. He nearly cried he was so glad, but\r\nhe warn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised. Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard\r\nme yell every time, but dasn\xe2\x80\x99t answer, because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want nobody to\r\npick _him_ up and take him into slavery again. Says he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got hurt a little, en couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swim fas\xe2\x80\x99, so I wuz a considerable\r\nways behine you towards de las\xe2\x80\x99; when you landed I reck\xe2\x80\x99ned I could\r\nketch up wid you on de lan\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99dout havin\xe2\x80\x99 to shout at you, but when I\r\nsee dat house I begin to go slow.

Dat Jack\xe2\x80\x99s a good nigger, en pooty smart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d show me a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens _he_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it \xe2\x80\x99ll be the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut it\r\npretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and\r\ngo to sleep again when I noticed how still it was\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be\r\nanybody stirring. That warn\xe2\x80\x99t usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up\r\nand gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down-stairs\xe2\x80\x94nobody\r\naround; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks\r\nI, what does it mean? Down by the woodpile I comes across my Jack, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSays he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know, Mars Jawge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, den, Miss Sophia\xe2\x80\x99s run off! \xe2\x80\x99deed she has. She run off in de\r\nnight some time\xe2\x80\x94nobody don\xe2\x80\x99t know jis\xe2\x80\x99 when; run off to get married\r\nto dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know\xe2\x80\x94leastways, so dey \xe2\x80\x99spec.\r\nDe fambly foun\xe2\x80\x99 it out \xe2\x80\x99bout half an hour ago\xe2\x80\x94maybe a little mo\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94en\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI _tell_ you dey warn\xe2\x80\x99t no time los\xe2\x80\x99. Sich another hurryin\xe2\x80\x99 up guns\r\nen hosses _you_ never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up de\r\nrelations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de\r\nriver road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him \xe2\x80\x99fo\xe2\x80\x99 he kin\r\ngit acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck\xe2\x80\x99n dey\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to be mighty\r\nrough times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuck went off \xe2\x80\x99thout waking me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I reck\xe2\x80\x99n he _did!_ Dey warn\xe2\x80\x99t gwyne to mix you up in it.\r\nMars Buck he loaded up his gun en \xe2\x80\x99lowed he\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to fetch home a\r\nShepherdson or bust. Well, dey\xe2\x80\x99ll be plenty un \xe2\x80\x99m dah, I reck\xe2\x80\x99n, en you\r\nbet you he\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin to\r\nhear guns a good ways off. When I came in sight of the log store and\r\nthe woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees\r\nand brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the\r\nforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a\r\nwood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first\r\nI was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open\r\nplace before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at\r\na couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the\r\nsteamboat-landing; but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come it. Every time one of them\r\nshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The\r\ntwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could\r\nwatch both ways.\r\n\r\nBy and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started\r\nriding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady\r\nbead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All\r\nthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started\r\nto carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the\r\nrun. They got half-way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.\r\nThen the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after\r\nthem. They gained on the boys, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good, the boys had\r\ntoo good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my\r\ntree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men\r\nagain. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap\r\nabout nineteen years old.\r\n\r\nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they\r\nwas out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was\r\nawful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when\r\nthe men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I\r\ndasn\xe2\x80\x99t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and \xe2\x80\x99lowed that him and\r\nhis cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this\r\nday yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or\r\nthree of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck\r\nsaid his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nShepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of\r\nyoung Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they\xe2\x80\x99d got across the river and\r\nwas safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him\xe2\x80\x94I hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nheard anything like it.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns\xe2\x80\x94the men had\r\nslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their\r\nhorses! The boys jumped for the river\xe2\x80\x94both of them hurt\xe2\x80\x94and as they\r\nswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and\r\nsinging out, \xe2\x80\x9cKill them, kill them!\xe2\x80\x9d It made me so sick I most fell\r\nout of the tree. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to tell _all_ that happened\xe2\x80\x94it would\r\nmake me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever come\r\nashore that night to see such things. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever going to get shut of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94lots of times I dream about them.\r\n\r\nI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.\r\nSometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little\r\ngangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the\r\ntrouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up\r\nmy mind I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever go a-near that house again, because I reckoned\r\nI was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that\r\nMiss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half past two and run\r\noff; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the\r\ncurious way she acted, and then maybe he would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 locked her up, and\r\nthis awful mess wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever happened.\r\n\r\nWhen I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river-bank a\r\npiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and\r\ntugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,\r\nand got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering\r\nup Buck\xe2\x80\x99s face, for he was mighty good to me.\r\n\r\nIt was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through\r\nthe woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn\xe2\x80\x99t on his island, so I\r\ntramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,\r\nred-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was\r\ngone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get my breath for most a\r\nminute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood lan\xe2\x80\x99! is dat you, honey? Doan\xe2\x80\x99 make no noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Jim\xe2\x80\x99s voice\xe2\x80\x94nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the\r\nbank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he\r\nwas so glad to see me. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws bless you, chile, I \xe2\x80\x99uz right down sho\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99s dead ag\xe2\x80\x99in. Jack\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen heah; he say he reck\xe2\x80\x99n you\xe2\x80\x99s ben shot, kase you didn\xe2\x80\x99 come home no\r\nmo\xe2\x80\x99; so I\xe2\x80\x99s jes\xe2\x80\x99 dis minute a-startin\xe2\x80\x99 de raf\xe2\x80\x99 down towards de mouf er\r\nde crick, so\xe2\x80\x99s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack\r\ncomes ag\xe2\x80\x99in en tells me for certain you _is_ dead. Lawsy, I\xe2\x80\x99s mighty\r\nglad to git you back ag\xe2\x80\x99in, honey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s mighty good; they won\xe2\x80\x99t find me, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll think\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been killed, and floated down the river\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s something up there\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x99ll help them think so\xe2\x80\x94so don\xe2\x80\x99t you lose no time, Jim, but just\r\nshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in\r\nthe middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and\r\njudged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a bite to eat\r\nsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,\r\nand pork and cabbage and greens\xe2\x80\x94there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing in the world so\r\ngood when it\xe2\x80\x99s cooked right\xe2\x80\x94and whilst I eat my supper we talked and\r\nhad a good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so\r\nwas Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no home like a\r\nraft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a\r\nraft don\xe2\x80\x99t. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum\r\nby, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we\r\nput in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there\xe2\x80\x94sometimes a\r\nmile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon\r\nas night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up\xe2\x80\x94nearly always\r\nin the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods\r\nand willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines.\r\nNext we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up\r\nand cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water\r\nwas about knee-deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound\r\nanywheres\xe2\x80\x94perfectly still\xe2\x80\x94just like the whole world was asleep, only\r\nsometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see,\r\nlooking away over the water, was a kind of dull line\xe2\x80\x94that was the\r\nwoods on t\xe2\x80\x99other side; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make nothing else out; then a pale\r\nplace in the sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river\r\nsoftened up away off, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t black any more, but gray; you could\r\nsee little dark spots drifting along ever so far away\xe2\x80\x94trading-scows,\r\nand such things; and long black streaks\xe2\x80\x94rafts; sometimes you could hear\r\na sweep screaking; or jumbled-up voices, it was so still, and sounds\r\ncome so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which\r\nyou know by the look of the streak that there\xe2\x80\x99s a snag there in a swift\r\ncurrent which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you\r\nsee the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and\r\nthe river, and you make out a log cabin in the edge of the woods, away\r\non the bank on t\xe2\x80\x99other side of the river, being a wood-yard, likely,\r\nand piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres;\r\nthen the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there,\r\nso cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the\r\nflowers; but sometimes not that way, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve left dead fish\r\nlaying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the\r\nsong-birds just going it!\r\n\r\nA little smoke couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\r\nof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would\r\nwatch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by\r\nand by lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done\r\nit, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off\r\ntowards the other side you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell nothing about her only\r\nwhether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour\r\nthere wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be nothing to hear nor nothing to see\xe2\x80\x94just solid\r\nlonesomeness. Next you\xe2\x80\x99d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and\r\nmaybe a galoot on it chopping, because they\xe2\x80\x99re most always doing it on\r\na raft; you\xe2\x80\x99d see the ax flash and come down\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear nothing;\r\nyou see that ax go up again, and by the time it\xe2\x80\x99s above the man\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nthen you hear the _k\xe2\x80\x99chunk!_\xe2\x80\x94it had took all that time to come over\r\nthe water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to\r\nthe stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things\r\nthat went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t run over\r\nthem. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and\r\ncussing and laughing\xe2\x80\x94heard them plain; but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no sign of\r\nthem; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that\r\nway in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; spirits wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x99Dern the dern fog.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\r\nmiddle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\r\nher to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\r\ntalked about all kinds of things\xe2\x80\x94we was always naked, day and night,\r\nwhenever the mosquitoes would let us\xe2\x80\x94the new clothes Buck\xe2\x80\x99s folks\r\nmade for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nmuch on clothes, nohow.\r\n\r\nSometimes we\xe2\x80\x99d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\r\ntime. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and\r\nmaybe a spark\xe2\x80\x94which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on\r\nthe water you could see a spark or two\xe2\x80\x94on a raft or a scow, you know;\r\nand maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of\r\nthem crafts. It\xe2\x80\x99s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there,\r\nall speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up\r\nat them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just\r\nhappened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I\r\njudged it would have took too long to _make_ so many. Jim said the\r\nmoon could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 _laid_ them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing against it, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a frog lay most as\r\nmany, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that\r\nfell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they\xe2\x80\x99d got spoiled\r\nand was hove out of the nest.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in\r\nthe dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up\r\nout of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look\r\nawful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink\r\nout and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by\r\nand by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and\r\njoggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear nothing for\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\r\n\r\nAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\r\nthree hours the shores was black\xe2\x80\x94no more sparks in the cabin windows.\r\nThese sparks was our clock\xe2\x80\x94the first one that showed again meant\r\nmorning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOne morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to\r\nthe main shore\xe2\x80\x94it was only two hundred yards\xe2\x80\x94and paddled about a\r\nmile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nsome berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath\r\ncrossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as\r\ntight as they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever\r\nanybody was after anybody I judged it was _me_\xe2\x80\x94or maybe Jim. I was\r\nabout to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to\r\nme then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives\xe2\x80\x94said they\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been doing nothing, and was being chased for it\xe2\x80\x94said there was\r\nmen and dogs a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you do it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear the dogs and horses yet; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\ntime to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways;\r\nthen you take to the water and wade down to me and get in\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthrow the dogs off the scent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,\r\nand in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away\r\noff, shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see them; they seemed to stop and fool around awhile; then,\r\nas we got further and further away all the time, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly\r\nhear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us\r\nand struck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the\r\ntowhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe.\r\n\r\nOne of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\r\nand very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a\r\ngreasy blue woolen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed\r\ninto his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses\xe2\x80\x94no, he only had one. He\r\nhad an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung\r\nover his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking\r\ncarpet-bags.\r\n\r\nThe other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. After\r\nbreakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come\r\nout was that these chaps didn\xe2\x80\x99t know one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat got you into trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d says the baldhead to t\xe2\x80\x99other chap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99d been selling an article to take the tartar off the\r\nteeth\xe2\x80\x94and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just\r\nin the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side\r\nof town, and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you\r\nto get off. So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would\r\nscatter out _with_ you. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole yarn\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s yourn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99d ben a-runnin\xe2\x80\x99 a little temperance revival thar \xe2\x80\x99bout a\r\nweek, and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was\r\nmakin\xe2\x80\x99 it mighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\nmuch as five or six dollars a night\xe2\x80\x94ten cents a head, children and\r\nniggers free\xe2\x80\x94and business a-growin\xe2\x80\x99 all the time, when somehow or\r\nanother a little report got around last night that I had a way of\r\nputtin\xe2\x80\x99 in my time with a private jug on the sly. A nigger rousted me\r\nout this mornin\xe2\x80\x99, and told me the people was getherin\xe2\x80\x99 on the quiet\r\nwith their dogs and horses, and they\xe2\x80\x99d be along pretty soon and give\r\nme \xe2\x80\x99bout half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s start, and then run me down if they could; and\r\nif they got me they\xe2\x80\x99d tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for no breakfast\xe2\x80\x94I warn\xe2\x80\x99t hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young one, \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon we might double-team it\r\ntogether; what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t undisposed. What\xe2\x80\x99s your line\xe2\x80\x94mainly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;\r\ntheater-actor\xe2\x80\x94tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and\r\nphrenology when there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance; teach singing-geography school for a\r\nchange; sling a lecture sometimes\xe2\x80\x94oh, I do lots of things\xe2\x80\x94most\r\nanything that comes handy, so it ain\xe2\x80\x99t work. What\xe2\x80\x99s your lay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. Layin\xe2\x80\x99 on o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhands is my best holt\xe2\x80\x94for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and\r\nI k\xe2\x80\x99n tell a fortune pretty good when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got somebody along to find\r\nout the facts for me. Preachin\xe2\x80\x99s my line, too, and workin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncamp-meetin\xe2\x80\x99s, and missionaryin\xe2\x80\x99 around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat \xe2\x80\x99re you alassin\xe2\x80\x99 about?\xe2\x80\x9d says the baldhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be\r\ndegraded down into such company.\xe2\x80\x9d And he begun to wipe the corner of\r\nhis eye with a rag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDern your skin, ain\xe2\x80\x99t the company good enough for you?\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nbaldhead, pretty pert and uppish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _is_ good enough for me; it\xe2\x80\x99s as good as I deserve; for who\r\nfetched me so low when I was so high? _I_ did myself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\n_you_, gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94far from it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame anybody. I deserve it\r\nall. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngrave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it\xe2\x80\x99s always done,\r\nand take everything from me\xe2\x80\x94loved ones, property, everything; but it\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t take that. Some day I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down in it and forget it all, and\r\nmy poor broken heart will be at rest.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on a-wiping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrot your pore broken heart,\xe2\x80\x9d says the baldhead; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you\r\nheaving your pore broken heart at _us_ f\xe2\x80\x99r? _We_ hain\xe2\x80\x99t done nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t blaming you, gentlemen. I\r\nbrought myself down\xe2\x80\x94yes, I did it myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s right I should\r\nsuffer\xe2\x80\x94perfectly right\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t make any moan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you would not believe me; the world never believes\xe2\x80\x94let it\r\npass\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis no matter. The secret of my birth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe secret of your birth! Do you mean to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d says the young man, very solemn, \xe2\x80\x9cI will reveal it to\r\nyou, for I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x99s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.\r\nThen the baldhead says: \xe2\x80\x9cNo! you can\xe2\x80\x99t mean it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater,\r\nfled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the\r\npure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own\r\nfather dying about the same time. The second son of the late duke\r\nseized the titles and estates\xe2\x80\x94the infant real duke was ignored. I am\r\nthe lineal descendant of that infant\xe2\x80\x94I am the rightful Duke of\r\nBridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted\r\nof men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heartbroken, and\r\ndegraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him,\r\nbut he said it warn\xe2\x80\x99t much use, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much comforted; said if\r\nwe was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than\r\nmost anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He\r\nsaid we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say \xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cYour Lordship\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it if we called\r\nhim plain \xe2\x80\x9cBridgewater,\xe2\x80\x9d which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a\r\nname; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little\r\nthing for him he wanted done.\r\n\r\nWell, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood\r\naround and waited on him, and says, \xe2\x80\x9cWill yo\xe2\x80\x99 Grace have some o\xe2\x80\x99 dis\r\nor some o\xe2\x80\x99 dat?\xe2\x80\x9d and so on, and a body could see it was mighty\r\npleasing to him.\r\n\r\nBut the old man got pretty silent by and by\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much to say,\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was\r\ngoing on around that duke. He seemed to have something on his mind.\r\nSo, along in the afternoon, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here, Bilgewater,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m nation sorry for you, but you\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t the only person that\xe2\x80\x99s had troubles like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t. You ain\xe2\x80\x99t the only person that\xe2\x80\x99s ben snaked down\r\nwrongfully out\xe2\x80\x99n a high place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t the only person that\xe2\x80\x99s had a secret of his birth.\xe2\x80\x9d And,\r\nby jings, _he_ begins to cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold! What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBilgewater, kin I trust you?\xe2\x80\x9d says the old man, still sort of\r\nsobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the bitter death!\xe2\x80\x9d He took the old man by the hand and squeezed\r\nit, and says, \xe2\x80\x9cThat secret of your being: speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend, it is too true\xe2\x80\x94your eyes is lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at this very\r\nmoment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of\r\nLooy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! At your age! No! You mean you\xe2\x80\x99re the late Charlemagne; you must\r\nbe six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has\r\nbrung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen,\r\nyou see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin\xe2\x80\x99, exiled,\r\ntrampled-on, and sufferin\xe2\x80\x99 rightful King of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn\xe2\x80\x99t know hardly what\r\nto do, we was so sorry\xe2\x80\x94and so glad and proud we\xe2\x80\x99d got him with us,\r\ntoo. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to\r\ncomfort _him._ But he said it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use, nothing but to be dead\r\nand done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often\r\nmade him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him\r\naccording to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and\r\nalways called him \xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d and waited on him first at meals,\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t set down in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me\r\nset to majestying him, and doing this and that and t\xe2\x80\x99other for him,\r\nand standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps\r\nof good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of\r\nsoured on him, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t look a bit satisfied with the way things was\r\ngoing; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the\r\nduke\xe2\x80\x99s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a\r\ngood deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the\r\npalace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by\r\nand by the king says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer\r\nraft, Bilgewater, and so what\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 your bein\xe2\x80\x99 sour? It \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nonly make things oncomfortable. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t my fault I warn\xe2\x80\x99t born a\r\nduke, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t your fault you warn\xe2\x80\x99t born a king\xe2\x80\x94so what\xe2\x80\x99s the use to\r\nworry? Make the best o\xe2\x80\x99 things the way you find \xe2\x80\x99em, says I\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nmotto. This ain\xe2\x80\x99t no bad thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve struck here\xe2\x80\x94plenty grub and\r\nan easy life\xe2\x80\x94come, give us your hand, duke, and le\xe2\x80\x99s all be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took\r\naway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it,\r\nbecause it would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been a miserable business to have any\r\nunfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a\r\nraft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind\r\ntowards the others.\r\n\r\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nkings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But I\r\nnever said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it\xe2\x80\x99s the best\r\nway; then you don\xe2\x80\x99t have no quarrels, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get into no trouble.\r\nIf they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nobjections, \xe2\x80\x99long as it would keep peace in the family; and it warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno use to tell Jim, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him. If I never learnt nothing\r\nelse out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind\r\nof people is to let them have their own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nThey asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we\r\ncovered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead\r\nof running\xe2\x80\x94was Jim a runaway nigger? Says I:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, they allowed he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I had to account for things some way, so\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born,\r\nand they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he \xe2\x80\x99lowed\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who\xe2\x80\x99s got a little\r\none-horse place on the river forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was\r\npretty poor, and had some debts; so when he\xe2\x80\x99d squared up there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nenough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other\r\nway. Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he\r\nketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we\xe2\x80\x99d go down to Orleans\r\non it. Pa\xe2\x80\x99s luck didn\xe2\x80\x99t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard\r\ncorner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under\r\nthe wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was\r\nonly four years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next\r\nday or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always\r\ncoming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they\r\nbelieved he was a runaway nigger. We don\xe2\x80\x99t run daytimes no more now;\r\nnights they don\xe2\x80\x99t bother us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we\r\nwant to. I\xe2\x80\x99ll think the thing over\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll invent a plan that \xe2\x80\x99ll fix\r\nit. We\xe2\x80\x99ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\ngo by that town yonder in daylight\xe2\x80\x94it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be healthy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the\r\nheat-lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the\r\nleaves was beginning to shiver\xe2\x80\x94it was going to be pretty ugly, it was\r\neasy to see that. So the duke and the king went to overhauling our\r\nwigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick\xe2\x80\x94better\r\nthan Jim\xe2\x80\x99s, which was a corn-shuck tick; there\xe2\x80\x99s always cobs around\r\nabout in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you\r\nroll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of\r\ndead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke\r\nallowed he would take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you\r\nthat a corn-shuck bed warn\xe2\x80\x99t just fitten for me to sleep on. Your\r\nGrace \xe2\x80\x99ll take the shuck bed yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was\r\ngoing to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when\r\nthe duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of\r\noppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I\r\nsubmit; \xe2\x80\x99tis my fate. I am alone in the world\xe2\x80\x94let me suffer; I can\r\nbear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand\r\nwell out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we\r\ngot a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch\r\nof lights by and by\xe2\x80\x94that was the town, you know\xe2\x80\x94and slid by, about a\r\nhalf a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below\r\nwe hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock it come on to\r\nrain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king\r\ntold us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him\r\nand the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It\r\nwas my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 turned in anyway if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d had a bed, because a body don\xe2\x80\x99t see such a storm as that every day\r\nin the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream\r\nalong! And every second or two there\xe2\x80\x99d come a glare that lit up the\r\nwhite-caps for a half a mile around, and you\xe2\x80\x99d see the islands looking\r\ndusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind;\r\nthen comes a _h-whack!_\xe2\x80\x94bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\n_rip_ comes another flash and another sock-dolager. The waves most\r\nwashed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any clothes on, and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no trouble about snags; the lightning\r\nwas glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them\r\nplenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.\r\n\r\nI had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that\r\ntime, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he\r\nwas always mighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam,\r\nbut the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t no show for me; so I laid outside\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind the rain,\r\nbecause it was warm, and the waves warn\xe2\x80\x99t running so high now. About\r\ntwo they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he\r\nchanged his mind, because he reckoned they warn\xe2\x80\x99t high enough yet to\r\ndo any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a\r\nsudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most\r\nkilled Jim a-laughing. He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever\r\nwas, anyway.\r\n\r\nI took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by\r\nthe storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that\r\nshowed I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding-quarters\r\nfor the day.\r\n\r\nThe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him\r\nand the duke played seven-up awhile, five cents a game. Then they got\r\ntired of it, and allowed they would \xe2\x80\x9clay out a campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d as they\r\ncalled it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a\r\nlot of little printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d would \xe2\x80\x9clecture on\r\nthe Science of Phrenology\xe2\x80\x9d at such and such a place, on the blank day\r\nof blank, at ten cents admission, and \xe2\x80\x9cfurnish charts of character at\r\ntwenty-five cents apiece.\xe2\x80\x9d The duke said that was _him._ In another\r\nbill he was the \xe2\x80\x9cworld-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the\r\nYounger, of Drury Lane, London.\xe2\x80\x9d In other bills he had a lot of other\r\nnames and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold\r\nwith a \xe2\x80\x9cdivining-rod,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdissipating witch spells,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on. By and\r\nby he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the\r\nboards, Royalty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall, then, before you\xe2\x80\x99re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays the duke. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first good town we come to we\xe2\x80\x99ll hire a hall and\r\ndo the sword-fight in \xe2\x80\x99Richard III.\xe2\x80\x99 and the balcony scene in \xe2\x80\x99Romeo\r\nand Juliet.\xe2\x80\x99 How does that strike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but,\r\nyou see, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing about play-actin\xe2\x80\x99, and hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever seen\r\nmuch of it. I was too small when pap used to have \xe2\x80\x99em at the palace.\r\nDo you reckon you can learn me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99m jist a-freezin\xe2\x80\x99 for something fresh, anyway. Le\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommence right away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was,\r\nand said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white\r\nwhiskers is goin\xe2\x80\x99 to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry; these country jakes won\xe2\x80\x99t ever think of that.\r\nBesides, you know, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in costume, and that makes all the\r\ndifference in the world; Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight\r\nbefore she goes to bed, and she\xe2\x80\x99s got on her nightgown and her ruffled\r\nnightcap. Here are the costumes for the parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was\r\nmeedyevil armor for Richard III. and t\xe2\x80\x99other chap, and a long white\r\ncotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. The king was\r\nsatisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\r\nmost splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\r\ntime, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\r\nking and told him to get his part by heart.\r\n\r\nThere was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\r\nafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to\r\nrun in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he\r\nwould go down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed he\r\nwould go, too, and see if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t strike something. We was out of\r\ncoffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get\r\nsome.\r\n\r\nWhen we got there there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody stirring; streets empty, and\r\nperfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger sunning\r\nhimself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn\xe2\x80\x99t too young or\r\ntoo sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in\r\nthe woods. The king got the directions, and allowed he\xe2\x80\x99d go and work\r\nthat camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\r\n\r\nThe duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it; a\r\nlittle bit of a concern, up over a carpenter-shop\xe2\x80\x94carpenters and\r\nprinters all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty,\r\nlittered-up place, and had ink-marks, and handbills with pictures of\r\nhorses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke shed\r\nhis coat and said he was all right now. So me and the king lit out for\r\nthe camp-meeting.\r\n\r\nWe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a\r\nmost awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from\r\ntwenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\r\neverywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off\r\nthe flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\r\nbranches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles\r\nof watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\r\n\r\nThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they\r\nwas bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of\r\noutside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive\r\nsticks into for legs. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no backs. The preachers had\r\nhigh platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on\r\nsun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones,\r\nand a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was\r\nbarefooted, and some of the children didn\xe2\x80\x99t have on any clothes but\r\njust a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some\r\nof the young folks was courting on the sly.\r\n\r\nThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined\r\nout two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\r\nthere was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\r\nhe lined out two more for them to sing\xe2\x80\x94and so on. The people woke up\r\nmore and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\r\nbegun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to\r\npreach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side\r\nof the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the\r\nfront of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and\r\nshouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he\r\nwould hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around\r\nthis way and that, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the brazen serpent in the\r\nwilderness! Look upon it and live!\xe2\x80\x9d And people would shout out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory!\xe2\x80\x94A-a-_men_!\xe2\x80\x9d And so he went on, and the people groaning and\r\ncrying and saying amen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come to the mourners\xe2\x80\x99 bench! come, black with sin! (_amen!_)\r\ncome, sick and sore! (_amen!_) come, lame and halt and blind!\r\n(_amen!_) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_a-a-men!_) come, all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s worn and soiled and suffering!\xe2\x80\x94come with a broken spirit! come\r\nwith a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters\r\nthat cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open\xe2\x80\x94oh, enter in and\r\nbe at rest!\xe2\x80\x9d (_a-a-men! glory, glory hallelujah!_)\r\n\r\nAnd so on. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out what the preacher said any more, on\r\naccount of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the\r\ncrowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\r\nmourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung\r\nand shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and\r\nwild.\r\n\r\nWell, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\r\nover everybody; and next he went a-charging up onto the platform, and\r\nthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He\r\ntold them he was a pirate\xe2\x80\x94been a pirate for thirty years out in the\r\nIndian Ocean\xe2\x80\x94and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\r\na fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\r\ngoodness he\xe2\x80\x99d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\r\nwithout a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing\r\nthat ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy\r\nfor the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to\r\nstart right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in\r\nthe rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path;\r\nfor he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all\r\npirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time\r\nto get there without money, he would get there anyway, and every time\r\nhe convinced a pirate he would say to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you thank me, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville\r\ncamp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that\r\ndear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody\r\nsings out, \xe2\x80\x9cTake up a collection for him, take up a collection!\xe2\x80\x9d Well,\r\na half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\n_him_ pass the hat around!\xe2\x80\x9d Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\r\n\r\nSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat, swabbing his\r\neyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for\r\nbeing so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little\r\nwhile the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their\r\ncheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to\r\nremember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and\r\nkissed as many as five or six times\xe2\x80\x94and he was invited to stay a\r\nweek; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of\r\nthe camp-meeting he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good, and besides he was in a sweat\r\nto get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\r\ncollected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had\r\nfetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\r\nwagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said, take\r\nit all around, it laid over any day he\xe2\x80\x99d ever put in in the\r\nmissionarying line. He said it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use talking, heathens don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\namount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.\r\n\r\nThe duke was thinking _he\xe2\x80\x99d_ been doing pretty well till the king\r\ncome to show up, but after that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so so much. He\r\nhad set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\r\nprinting-office\xe2\x80\x94horse bills\xe2\x80\x94and took the money, four dollars. And he\r\nhad got in ten dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of advertisements for the paper, which\r\nhe said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in\r\nadvance\xe2\x80\x94so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a\r\nyear, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on\r\ncondition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in\r\ncordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the\r\nconcern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and\r\nwas going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry,\r\nwhich he made, himself, out of his own head\xe2\x80\x94three verses\xe2\x80\x94kind of\r\nsweet and saddish\xe2\x80\x94the name of it was, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, crush, cold world, this\r\nbreaking heart\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he left that all set up and ready to print in the\r\npaper, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars\r\nand a half, and said he\xe2\x80\x99d done a pretty square day\xe2\x80\x99s work for it.\r\n\r\nThen he showed us another little job he\xe2\x80\x99d printed and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t charged\r\nfor, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with\r\na bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and \xe2\x80\x9c$200 reward\xe2\x80\x9d under it. The\r\nreading was all about Jim and just described him to a dot. It said he\r\nrun away from St. Jacques\xe2\x80\x99s plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,\r\nlast winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and\r\nsend him back he could have the reward and expenses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d says the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cafter to-night we can run in the daytime if we\r\nwant to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot\r\nwith a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say\r\nwe captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a\r\nsteamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and\r\nare going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look\r\nstill better on Jim, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go well with the story of us\r\nbeing so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nmust preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be no\r\ntrouble about running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough\r\nthat night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the\r\nduke\xe2\x80\x99s work in the printing-office was going to make in that little\r\ntown; then we could boom right along if we wanted to.\r\n\r\nWe laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck, does you reck\xe2\x80\x99n we gwyne to run acrost any mo\xe2\x80\x99 kings on dis\r\ntrip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cdat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, den. I doan\xe2\x80\x99 mine one er two kings,\r\nbut dat\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Dis one\xe2\x80\x99s powerful drunk, en de duke ain\xe2\x80\x99 much\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could\r\nhear what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so\r\nlong, and had so much trouble, he\xe2\x80\x99d forgot it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn\xe2\x80\x99t tie up. The\r\nking and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good\r\ndeal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the\r\nraft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his\r\nlegs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe,\r\nand went to getting his \xe2\x80\x9cRomeo and Juliet\xe2\x80\x9d by heart. When he had got\r\nit pretty good him and the duke begun to practise it together. The\r\nduke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and\r\nhe made him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he\r\nsaid he done it pretty well; \xe2\x80\x9conly,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t bellow out\r\n_Romeo!_ that way, like a bull\xe2\x80\x94you must say it soft and sick and\r\nlanguishy, so\xe2\x80\x94R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s a dear sweet\r\nmere child of a girl, you know, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bray like a jackass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out\r\nof oak laths, and begun to practise the sword-fight\xe2\x80\x94the duke called\r\nhimself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the\r\nraft was grand to see. But by and by the king tripped and fell\r\noverboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all\r\nkinds of adventures they\xe2\x80\x99d had in other times along the river.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Capet, we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so\r\nI guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll add a little more to it. We want a little something to\r\nanswer encores with, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s onkores, Bilgewater?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke told him, and then says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s hornpipe; and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94well, let me see\xe2\x80\x94oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it\xe2\x80\x94you can do Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoliloquy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHamlet\xe2\x80\x99s which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHamlet\xe2\x80\x99s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in\r\nShakespeare. Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t got it in the book\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve only got one volume\xe2\x80\x94but I reckon I\r\ncan piece it out from memory. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just walk up and down a minute, and\r\nsee if I can call it back from recollection\xe2\x80\x99s vaults.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible\r\nevery now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would\r\nsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan;\r\nnext he would sigh, and next he\xe2\x80\x99d let on to drop a tear. It was\r\nbeautiful to see him. By and by he got it. He told us to give\r\nattention. Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved\r\nforwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back,\r\nlooking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his\r\nteeth; and after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread\r\naround, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of\r\nany acting ever _I_ see before. This is the speech\xe2\x80\x94I learned it, easy\r\nenough, while he was learning it to the king:\r\n\r\n    To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin\r\n    That makes calamity of so long life;\r\n    For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to\r\n        Dunsinane,\r\n    But that the fear of something after death\r\n    Murders the innocent sleep,\r\n    Great nature\xe2\x80\x99s second course,\r\n    And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune\r\n    Than fly to others that we know not of.\r\n    There\xe2\x80\x99s the respect must give us pause:\r\n    Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst;\r\n    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\r\n    The oppressor\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, the proud man\xe2\x80\x99s contumely,\r\n    The law\xe2\x80\x99s delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take,\r\n    In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards\r\n        yawn\r\n    In customary suits of solemn black,\r\n    But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no\r\n        traveler returns,\r\n    Breathes forth contagion on the world,\r\n    And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\n        adage,\r\n    Is sicklied o\xe2\x80\x99er with care,\r\n    And all the clouds that lowered o\xe2\x80\x99er our housetops,\r\n    With this regard their currents turn awry,\r\n    And lose the name of action.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x99Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the\r\n        fair Ophelia:\r\n    Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws,\r\n    But get thee to a nunnery\xe2\x80\x94go!\r\n\r\nWell, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so\r\nhe could do it first-rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and\r\nwhen he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the\r\nway he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.\r\n\r\nThe first chance we got the duke he had some show-bills printed; and\r\nafter that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a\r\nmost uncommon lively place, for there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing but sword-fighting\r\nand rehearsing\xe2\x80\x94as the duke called it\xe2\x80\x94going on all the time. One\r\nmorning, when we was pretty well down the state of Arkansaw, we come\r\nin sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was\r\nshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took\r\nthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that\r\nplace for our show.\r\n\r\nWe struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that\r\nafternoon, and the country-people was already beginning to come in, in\r\nall kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave\r\nbefore night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he\r\nhired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They\r\nread like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shaksperean Revival ! ! !\r\n    Wonderful Attraction!\r\n    For One Night Only!\r\n    The world-renowned tragedians,\r\n    David Garrick the younger, of Drury Lane Theatre, London,\r\n       and\r\n    Edmund Kean the elder, of the Royal Haymarket Theatre,\r\n    Whitechapel, Pudding Lane, Piccadilly, London, and the\r\n    Royal Continental Theatres, in their sublime\r\n    Shaksperean Spectacle entitled\r\n    The Balcony Scene\r\n       in\r\n    Romeo and Juliet ! ! !\r\n    Romeo...................Mr. Garrick\r\n    Juliet..................Mr. Kean\r\n    Assisted by the whole strength of the company!\r\n    New costumes, new scenery, new appointments!\r\n       Also:\r\n    The thrilling, masterly, and blood-curdling\r\n    Broad-sword conflict\r\n    In Richard III. ! ! !\r\n    Richard III.............Mr. Garrick\r\n    Richmond................Mr. Kean\r\n       Also:\r\n    (by special request)\r\n    Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s Immortal Soliloquy ! !\r\n    By the Illustrious Kean!\r\n    Done by him 300 consecutive nights in Paris!\r\n    For One Night Only,\r\n    On account of imperative European engagements!\r\n    Admission 25 cents; children and servants, 10 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen we went loafing around town. The stores and houses was most all\r\nold, shackly, dried-up frame concerns that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever been painted;\r\nthey was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be\r\nout of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses\r\nhad little gardens around them, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to raise hardly\r\nanything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and\r\nold curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and\r\nplayed-out tinware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards,\r\nnailed on at different times; and they leaned every which way, and had\r\ngates that didn\xe2\x80\x99t generly have but one hinge\xe2\x80\x94a leather one. Some of the\r\nfences had been whitewashed some time or another, but the duke said\r\nit was in Columbus\xe2\x80\x99s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the\r\ngarden, and people driving them out.\r\n\r\nAll the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in\r\nfront, and the country-people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.\r\nThere was empty dry-goods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting\r\non them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and\r\nchawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching\xe2\x80\x94a mighty ornery\r\nlot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,\r\nbut didn\xe2\x80\x99t wear no coats nor waistcoats; they called one another Bill,\r\nand Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and\r\nused considerable many cuss-words. There was as many as one loafer\r\nleaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands\r\nin his britches pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw\r\nof tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the\r\ntime was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGimme a chaw \xe2\x80\x99v tobacker, Hank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCain\xe2\x80\x99t; I hain\xe2\x80\x99t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nnone. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world,\r\nnor a chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by\r\nborrowing; they say to a fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cI wisht you\xe2\x80\x99d len\xe2\x80\x99 me a chaw, Jack, I\r\njist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is a lie\r\npretty much every time; it don\xe2\x80\x99t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no stranger, so he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister\xe2\x80\x99s cat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrandmother. You pay me back the chaws you\xe2\x80\x99ve awready borry\xe2\x80\x99d off\xe2\x80\x99n me,\r\nLafe Buckner, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won\xe2\x80\x99t charge\r\nyou no back intrust, nuther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99bout six chaws. You borry\xe2\x80\x99d store tobacker and paid back\r\nnigger-head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the\r\nnatural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don\xe2\x80\x99t generly cut\r\nit off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw\r\nwith their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it\r\nin two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at\r\nit when it\xe2\x80\x99s handed back, and says, sarcastic:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cGIMME A CHAW\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing else _but_\r\nmud\xe2\x80\x94mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,\r\nand two or three inches deep in _all_ the places. The hogs loafed and\r\ngrunted around everywheres. You\xe2\x80\x99d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs\r\ncome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the\r\nway, where folks had to walk around her, and she\xe2\x80\x99d stretch out and\r\nshut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and\r\nlook as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you\xe2\x80\x99d hear a\r\nloafer sing out, \xe2\x80\x9cHi! _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!\xe2\x80\x9d and away the sow would\r\ngo, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear,\r\nand three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the\r\nloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun\r\nand look grateful for the noise. Then they\xe2\x80\x99d settle back again till\r\nthere was a dog-fight. There couldn\xe2\x80\x99t anything wake them up all over,\r\nand make them happy all over, like a dog-fight\xe2\x80\x94unless it might be\r\nputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a\r\ntin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.\r\n\r\nOn the river-front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,\r\nand they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people\r\nhad moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some\r\nothers, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but\r\nit was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house\r\ncaves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep\r\nwill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the\r\nriver in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,\r\nand back, and back, because the river\xe2\x80\x99s always gnawing at it.\r\n\r\nThe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the\r\nwagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.\r\nFamilies fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them\r\nin the wagons. There was considerable whisky-drinking going on, and I\r\nseen three fights. By and by somebody sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes old Boggs!\xe2\x80\x94in from the country for his little old monthly\r\ndrunk; here he comes, boys!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out\r\nof Boggs. One of them says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder who he\xe2\x80\x99s a-gwyne to chaw up this time. If he\xe2\x80\x99d a-chawed up all\r\nthe men he\xe2\x80\x99s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nconsiderable ruputation now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother one says, \xe2\x80\x9cI wisht old Boggs \xe2\x80\x99d threaten me, \xe2\x80\x99cuz then I\xe2\x80\x99d know\r\nI warn\xe2\x80\x99t gwyne to die for a thousan\xe2\x80\x99 year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an\r\nInjun, and singing out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCler the track, thar. I\xe2\x80\x99m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is\r\na-gwyne to raise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year\r\nold, and had a very red face. Everybody yelled at him and laughed at\r\nhim and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he\xe2\x80\x99d attend to them\r\nand lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait now\r\nbecause he\xe2\x80\x99d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto\r\nwas, \xe2\x80\x9cMeat first, and spoon vittles to top off on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe see me, and rode up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhar\xe2\x80\x99d you come f\xe2\x80\x99m, boy? You prepared to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t mean nothing; he\xe2\x80\x99s always a-carryin\xe2\x80\x99 on like that when he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrunk. He\xe2\x80\x99s the best-naturedest old fool in Arkansaw\xe2\x80\x94never hurt nobody,\r\ndrunk nor sober.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down\r\nso he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you\xe2\x80\x99ve swindled.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re the houn\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m after, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a-gwyne to have you, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue\r\nto, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and\r\ngoing on. By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five\xe2\x80\x94and he was a\r\nheap the best-dressed man in that town, too\xe2\x80\x94steps out of the store, and\r\nthe crowd drops back on each side to let him come. He says to Boggs,\r\nmighty ca\xe2\x80\x99m and slow\xe2\x80\x94he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tired of this, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll endure it till one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Till one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, mind\xe2\x80\x94no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once\r\nafter that time you can\xe2\x80\x99t travel so far but I will find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody\r\nstirred, and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no more laughing. Boggs rode off\r\nblackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;\r\nand pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping\r\nit up. Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; they told him it would be one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in about fifteen\r\nminutes, and so he _must_ go home\xe2\x80\x94he must go right away. But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo no good. He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down\r\nin the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down\r\nthe street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could\r\nget a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so\r\nthey could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use\xe2\x80\x94up the\r\nstreet he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. By and\r\nby somebody says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo for his daughter!\xe2\x80\x94quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlisten to her. If anybody can persuade him, she can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways and stopped.\r\nIn about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his\r\nhorse. He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bareheaded, with\r\na friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him\r\nalong. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn\xe2\x80\x99t hanging back any,\r\nbut was doing some of the hurrying himself. Somebody sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoggs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel\r\nSherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a\r\npistol raised in his right hand\xe2\x80\x94not aiming it, but holding it out with\r\nthe barrel tilted up towards the sky. The same second I see a young\r\ngirl coming on the run, and two men with her. Boggs and the men turned\r\nround to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men\r\njumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady\r\nto a level\xe2\x80\x94both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot!\xe2\x80\x9d Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers\r\nback, clawing at the air\xe2\x80\x94bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles\r\nbackwards onto the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.\r\nThat young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws\r\nherself on her father, crying, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s killed him, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkilled him!\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed\r\none another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on\r\nthe inside trying to shove them back and shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cBack, back! give\r\nhim air, give him air!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol onto the ground, and turned\r\naround on his heels and walked off.\r\n\r\nThey took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just\r\nthe same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good\r\nplace at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. They\r\nlaid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and\r\nopened another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his\r\nshirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. He made about\r\na dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed\r\nin his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nafter that he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter\r\naway from him, screaming and crying, and took her off. She was about\r\nsixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.\r\n\r\nWell, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and\r\npushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people\r\nthat had the places wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give them up, and folks behind them was\r\nsaying all the time, \xe2\x80\x9cSay, now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve looked enough, you fellows;\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t right and \xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t fair for you to stay thar all the time, and\r\nnever give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe\r\nthere was going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was\r\nexcited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,\r\nand there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,\r\nstretching their necks and listening. One long, lanky man, with long\r\nhair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a\r\ncrooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs\r\nstood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around\r\nfrom one place to t\xe2\x80\x99other and watching everything he done, and bobbing\r\ntheir heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting\r\ntheir hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground\r\nwith his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn\r\nhad stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and\r\nsung out, \xe2\x80\x9cBoggs!\xe2\x80\x9d and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and\r\nsays \xe2\x80\x9cBang!\xe2\x80\x9d staggered backwards, says \xe2\x80\x9cBang!\xe2\x80\x9d again, and fell down\r\nflat on his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it\r\nperfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened. Then as much\r\nas a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.\r\n\r\nWell, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about a\r\nminute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and\r\nsnatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThey swarmed up towards Sherburn\xe2\x80\x99s house, a-whooping and raging like\r\nInjuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped\r\nto mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the\r\nmob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along\r\nthe road was full of women\xe2\x80\x99s heads, and there was nigger boys in every\r\ntree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as\r\nthe mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out\r\nof reach. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared\r\nmost to death.\r\n\r\nThey swarmed up in front of Sherburn\xe2\x80\x99s palings as thick as they could\r\njam together, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear yourself think for the noise. It\r\nwas a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out \xe2\x80\x9cTear down the fence! tear\r\ndown the fence!\xe2\x80\x9d Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and\r\nsmashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to\r\nroll in like a wave.\r\n\r\nJust then Sherburn steps out onto the roof of his little front porch,\r\nwith a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly\r\nca\xe2\x80\x99m and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the\r\nwave sucked back.\r\n\r\nSherburn never said a word\xe2\x80\x94just stood there, looking down. The\r\nstillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. Sherburn run his eye\r\nslow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little\r\nto outgaze him, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t; they dropped their eyes and looked\r\nsneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant\r\nkind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s got sand in it.\r\n\r\nThen he says, slow and scornful:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of _you_ lynching anybody! It\xe2\x80\x99s amusing. The idea of you\r\nthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man!_ Because you\xe2\x80\x99re brave\r\nenough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come\r\nalong here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your\r\nhands on a _man?_ Why, a _man\xe2\x80\x99s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of\r\nyour kind\xe2\x80\x94as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s daytime and you\xe2\x80\x99re not behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the\r\nSouth, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around.\r\nThe average man\xe2\x80\x99s a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him\r\nthat wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear\r\nit. In the South one man, all by himself, has stopped a stage full\r\nof men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you\r\na brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94whereas you\xe2\x80\x99re just _as_ brave, and no braver. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t your\r\njuries hang murderers? Because they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid the man\xe2\x80\x99s friends will\r\nshoot them in the back, in the dark\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s just what they _would_ do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a\r\nhundred masked cowards at his back, and lynches the rascal. Your\r\nmistake is, that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring a man with you; that\xe2\x80\x99s one mistake,\r\nand the other is that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come in the dark and fetch your masks.\r\nYou brought _part_ of a man\xe2\x80\x94Buck Harkness, there\xe2\x80\x94and if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had\r\nhim to start you, you\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 taken it out in blowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come. The average man don\xe2\x80\x99t like trouble and\r\ndanger. _You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t like trouble and danger. But if only _half_ a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94like Buck Harkness, there\xe2\x80\x94shouts \xe2\x80\x99Lynch him! lynch him!\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nafraid to back down\xe2\x80\x94afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll be found out to be what you\r\nare\xe2\x80\x94_cowards_\xe2\x80\x94and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves onto that\r\nhalf-a-man\xe2\x80\x99s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big\r\nthings you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat an army is\xe2\x80\x94a mob; they don\xe2\x80\x99t fight with courage that\xe2\x80\x99s born in\r\nthem, but with courage that\xe2\x80\x99s borrowed from their mass, and from their\r\nofficers. But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_\r\npitifulness. Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and\r\ngo home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching\xe2\x80\x99s going to be done it\r\nwill be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along. Now _leave_\xe2\x80\x94and take your\r\nhalf-a-man with you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking\r\nit when he says this.\r\n\r\nThe crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went\r\ntearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them,\r\nlooking tolerable cheap. I could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 stayed if I wanted to, but I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\r\n\r\nI went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman\r\nwent by, and then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold\r\npiece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from\r\nhome and amongst strangers that way. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be too careful. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nopposed to spending money on circuses when there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no other way,\r\nbut there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use in _wasting_ it on them.\r\n\r\nIt was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was\r\nwhen they all come riding in, two and two, and gentleman and lady,\r\nside by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no\r\nshoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and\r\ncomfortable\xe2\x80\x94there must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been twenty of them\xe2\x80\x94and every lady with\r\na lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like\r\na gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost\r\nmillions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful\r\nfine sight; I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they\r\ngot up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and\r\nwavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight,\r\nwith their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the\r\ntent-roof, and every lady\xe2\x80\x99s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky\r\naround her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.\r\n\r\nAnd then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first\r\none foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more\r\nand more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center pole,\r\ncracking his whip and shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHi!\xe2\x80\x94hi!\xe2\x80\x9d and the clown cracking jokes\r\nbehind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady\r\nput her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and\r\nthen how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after\r\nthe other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow\r\nI ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands\r\nand went just about wild.\r\n\r\nWell, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things;\r\nand all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.\r\nThe ringmaster couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever say a word to him but he was back at him\r\nquick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how\r\nhe ever _could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat,\r\nwas what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t no way understand. Why, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 thought\r\nof them in a year. And by and by a drunken man tried to get into the\r\nring\xe2\x80\x94said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody\r\nthat ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlisten, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun\r\nto holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he\r\nbegun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of\r\nmen begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm toward the ring,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cKnock him down! throw him out!\xe2\x80\x9d and one or two women begun to\r\nscream. So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he\r\nhoped there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought\r\nhe could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right,\r\nand the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and\r\ntear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his\r\nbridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck,\r\nand his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of\r\npeople standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at\r\nlast, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose,\r\nand away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with\r\nthat sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one\r\nleg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t\xe2\x80\x99other one on\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other side, and the people just crazy. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t funny to me, though;\r\nI was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled\r\nup astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and\r\nthe next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and\r\nthe horse a-going like a house afire, too. He just stood up there,\r\na-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever drunk in\r\nhis life\xe2\x80\x94and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He\r\nshed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he\r\nshed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and\r\ndressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that\r\nhorse with his whip and made him fairly hum\xe2\x80\x94and finally skipped off,\r\nand made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody\r\njust a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.\r\n\r\nThen the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the\r\nsickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his\r\nown men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never\r\nlet on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been in that ringmaster\xe2\x80\x99s place, not for a thousand\r\ndollars. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one\r\nwas, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough\r\nfor _me_; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom\r\nevery time.\r\n\r\nWell, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn\xe2\x80\x99t only about twelve\r\npeople there\xe2\x80\x94just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the\r\ntime, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before\r\nthe show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these\r\nArkansaw lunkheads couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted\r\nwas low comedy\xe2\x80\x94and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he\r\nreckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he got\r\nsome big sheets of wrapping-paper and some black paint, and drawed off\r\nsome handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. The bills said:\r\n\r\n\r\n   AT THE COURT HOUSE!\r\n   FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY!\r\n   _The World-Renowned Tragedians_\r\n   DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!\r\n      AND\r\n   EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!\r\n   _Of the London and Continental\r\n   Theatres_,\r\n   In their Thrilling Tragedy of\r\n   THE KING\xe2\x80\x99S CAMELEOPARD,\r\n      OR\r\n   THE ROYAL NONESUCH ! ! !\r\n   _Admission 50 cents._\r\n\r\nThen at the bottom was the biggest line of all, which said:\r\n\r\n   LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cif that line don\xe2\x80\x99t fetch them, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nArkansaw!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and\r\na curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the\r\nhouse was jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold no\r\nmore, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and\r\ncome onto the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little\r\nspeech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most\r\nthrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the\r\ntragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main\r\nprincipal part in it; and at last when he\xe2\x80\x99d got everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next\r\nminute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was\r\npainted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as\r\nsplendid as a rainbow. And\xe2\x80\x94but never mind the rest of his outfit; it\r\nwas just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed\r\nthemselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered\r\noff behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and\r\nhaw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that\r\nthey made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to\r\nsee the shines that old idiot cut.\r\n\r\nThen the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and\r\nsays the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on\r\naccounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold\r\nalready for it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and\r\nsays if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he\r\nwill be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and\r\nget them to come and see it.\r\n\r\nTwenty people sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, is it over? Is that _all_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSold!\xe2\x80\x9d and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them\r\ntragedians. But a big, fine-looking man jumps up on a bench and\r\nshouts:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on! Just a word, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d They stopped to listen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\nsold\xe2\x80\x94mighty badly sold. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the laughing-stock of\r\nthis whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as\r\nlong as we live. _No_. What we want is to go out of here quiet, and\r\ntalk this show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town! Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be\r\nin the same boat. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t that sensible?\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet it is!\xe2\x80\x94the jedge is\r\nright!\xe2\x80\x9d everybody sings out.) \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then\xe2\x80\x94not a word about any\r\nsell. Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the\r\ntragedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext day you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear nothing around that town but how splendid\r\nthat show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this\r\ncrowd the same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to the\r\nraft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim\r\nand me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and\r\nfetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.\r\n\r\nThe third night the house was crammed again\xe2\x80\x94and they warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnew-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two\r\nnights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that\r\nwent in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his\r\ncoat\xe2\x80\x94and I see it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.\r\nI smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such\r\nthings; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet\r\nI do, there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in there for a\r\nminute, but it was too various for me; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. Well, when\r\nthe place couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a\r\nquarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he\r\nstarted around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we\r\nturned the corner and was in the dark he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for\r\nthe raft like the dickens was after you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI done it, and he done the same. We struck the raft at the same time,\r\nand in less than two seconds we was gliding down-stream, all dark and\r\nstill, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a\r\nword. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the\r\naudience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from\r\nunder the wigwam, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how\xe2\x80\x99d the old thing pan out this time, duke?\xe2\x80\x9d He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nup-town at all.\r\n\r\nWe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.\r\nThen we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly\r\nlaughed their bones loose over the way they\xe2\x80\x99d served them people. The\r\nduke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreenhorns, flatheads! _I_ knew the first house would keep mum and let\r\nthe rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they\xe2\x80\x99d lay for us the\r\nthird night, and consider it was _their_ turn now. Well, it _is_ their\r\nturn, and I\xe2\x80\x99d give something to know how much they\xe2\x80\x99d take for it. I\r\n_would_ just like to know how they\xe2\x80\x99re putting in their opportunity.\r\nThey can turn it into a picnic if they want to\xe2\x80\x94they brought plenty\r\nprovisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that\r\nthree nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBy and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t it s\xe2\x80\x99prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cit don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t it, Huck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it don\xe2\x80\x99t, because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the breed. I reckon they\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nalike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Huck, dese kings o\xe2\x80\x99 ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat\xe2\x80\x99s jist what\r\ndey is; dey\xe2\x80\x99s reglar rapscallions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as\r\nfur as I can make out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs dat so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou read about them once\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this\r\n\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99s a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_. And look at Charles\r\nSecond, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and\r\nEdward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them\r\nSaxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise\r\nCain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.\r\nHe _was_ a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop\r\noff her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as\r\nif he was ordering up eggs. \xe2\x80\x99Fetch up Nell Gwynn,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. They fetch\r\nher up. Next morning, \xe2\x80\x99Chop off her head!\xe2\x80\x99 And they chop it off.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Fetch up Jane Shore,\xe2\x80\x99 he says; and up she comes. Next morning, \xe2\x80\x99Chop\r\noff her head\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and they chop it off. \xe2\x80\x99Ring up Fair Rosamun.\xe2\x80\x99 Fair\r\nRosamun answers the bell. Next morning, \xe2\x80\x99Chop off her head.\xe2\x80\x99 And he\r\nmade every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that\r\nup till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he\r\nput them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book\xe2\x80\x94which was a good\r\nname and stated the case. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know kings, Jim, but I know them;\r\nand this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I\xe2\x80\x99ve struck in\r\nhistory. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble\r\nwith this country. How does he go at it\xe2\x80\x94give notice?\xe2\x80\x94give the\r\ncountry a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston\r\nHarbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and\r\ndares them to come on. That was _his_ style\xe2\x80\x94he never give anybody a\r\nchance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well,\r\nwhat did he do? Ask him to show up? No\xe2\x80\x94drownded him in a butt of\r\nmamsey, like a cat. S\xe2\x80\x99pose people left money laying around where he\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94what did he do? He collared it. S\xe2\x80\x99pose he contracted to do a\r\nthing, and you paid him, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t set down there and see that he\r\ndone it\xe2\x80\x94what did he do? He always done the other thing. S\xe2\x80\x99pose he\r\nopened his mouth\xe2\x80\x94what then? If he didn\xe2\x80\x99t shut it up powerful quick\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d lose a lie every time. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 had him along \xe2\x80\x99stead of our kings he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 fooled that town a\r\nheap worse than ourn done. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that ourn is lambs, because\r\nthey ain\xe2\x80\x99t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnothing to _that_ old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and\r\nyou got to make allowances. Take them all around, they\xe2\x80\x99re a mighty\r\nornery lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s the way they\xe2\x80\x99re raised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they all do, Jim. _We_ can\xe2\x80\x99t help the way a king smells; history\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t tell no way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow de duke, he\xe2\x80\x99s a tolerble likely man in some ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a duke\xe2\x80\x99s different. But not very different. This one\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmiddling hard lot for a duke. When he\xe2\x80\x99s drunk there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nnear-sighted man could tell him from a king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyways, I doan\xe2\x80\x99 hanker for no mo\xe2\x80\x99 un um, Huck. Dese is all I\r\nkin stan\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got them on our hands, and\r\nwe got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I\r\nwish we could hear of a country that\xe2\x80\x99s out of kings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn\xe2\x80\x99t real kings and dukes? It\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell them from the real kind.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep, and Jim didn\xe2\x80\x99t call me when it was my turn. He often\r\ndone that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with\r\nhis head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t take notice nor let on. I knowed what it was about. He was\r\nthinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was\r\nlow and homesick; because he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever been away from home before in\r\nhis life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as\r\nwhite folks does for their\xe2\x80\x99n. It don\xe2\x80\x99t seem natural, but I reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso. He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged\r\nI was asleep, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPo\xe2\x80\x99 little \xe2\x80\x99Lizabeth! po\xe2\x80\x99 little Johnny!\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s mighty hard; I spec\xe2\x80\x99 I ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever gwyne to see you no mo\xe2\x80\x99, no\r\nmo\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.\r\n\r\nBut this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young\r\nones; and by and by he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes me feel so bad dis time \xe2\x80\x99uz bekase I hear sumpn over\r\nyonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er\r\nde time I treat my little \xe2\x80\x99Lizabeth so ornery. She warn\xe2\x80\x99t on\xe2\x80\x99y \xe2\x80\x99bout\r\nfo\xe2\x80\x99 year ole, en she tuck de sk\xe2\x80\x99yarlet fever, en had a powful rough\r\nspell; but she got well, en one day she was a-stannin\xe2\x80\x99 aroun\xe2\x80\x99, en I\r\nsays to her, I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Shet de do\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never done it; jis\xe2\x80\x99 stood dah, kiner smilin\xe2\x80\x99 up at me. It make me\r\nmad; en I says ag\xe2\x80\x99in, mighty loud, I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Doan\xe2\x80\x99 you hear me? Shet de do\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe jis stood de same way, kiner smilin\xe2\x80\x99 up. I was a-bilin\xe2\x80\x99! I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I lay I _make_ you mine!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEn wid dat I fetch\xe2\x80\x99 her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nDen I went into de yuther room, en \xe2\x80\x99uz gone \xe2\x80\x99bout ten minutes; en when\r\nI come back dah was dat do\xe2\x80\x99 a-stannin\xe2\x80\x99 open _yit_, en dat chile\r\nstannin\xe2\x80\x99 mos\xe2\x80\x99 right in it, a-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 down and mournin\xe2\x80\x99, en de tears\r\nrunnin\xe2\x80\x99 down. My, but I _wuz_ mad!

I crope out, all a-tremblin\xe2\x80\x99, en crope aroun\xe2\x80\x99 en\r\nopen de do\xe2\x80\x99 easy en slow, en poke my head in behine de chile, sof\xe2\x80\x99 en\r\nstill, en all uv a sudden I says _pow!_ jis\xe2\x80\x99 as loud as I could yell.\r\n_She never budge!_ Oh, Huck, I bust out a-cryin\xe2\x80\x99 en grab her up in my\r\narms, en say, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, de po\xe2\x80\x99 little thing! De Lord God Amighty fogive po\xe2\x80\x99\r\nole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long\xe2\x80\x99s he live!\xe2\x80\x99 Oh,\r\nshe was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb deef en dumb\xe2\x80\x94en I\xe2\x80\x99d ben\r\na-treat\xe2\x80\x99n her so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out\r\nin the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river,\r\nand the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them\r\ntowns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nbut a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when\r\nhe had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when\r\nwe left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened\r\non to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look much like he\r\nwas a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard\r\nto have to lay roped all day, and he\xe2\x80\x99d cipher out some way to get\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He\r\ndressed Jim up in King Lear\xe2\x80\x99s outfit\xe2\x80\x94it was a long curtain-calico\r\ngown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his\r\ntheater paint and painted Jim\xe2\x80\x99s face and hands and ears and neck all\r\nover a dead, dull solid blue, like a man that\xe2\x80\x99s been drownded nine\r\ndays. Blamed if he warn\xe2\x80\x99t the horriblest-looking outrage I ever see.\r\nThen the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\r\n\r\n_Sick Arab\xe2\x80\x94but harmless when not out of his head._\r\n\r\nAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or\r\nfive foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a\r\nsight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and\r\ntrembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to\r\nmake himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around,\r\nhe must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl\r\nor two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and\r\nleave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the\r\naverage man, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for him to howl. Why, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t only\r\nlook like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.\r\n\r\nThese rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\r\nso much money in it, but they judged it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be safe, because\r\nmaybe the news might \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 worked along down by this time. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he\r\nreckoned he\xe2\x80\x99d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he\r\nallowed he would drop over to t\xe2\x80\x99other village without any plan, but\r\njust trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way\xe2\x80\x94meaning the\r\ndevil, I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped\r\nlast; and now the king put his\xe2\x80\x99n on, and he told me to put mine on. I\r\ndone it, of course. The king\xe2\x80\x99s duds was all black, and he did look\r\nreal swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body\r\nbefore. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever\r\nwas; but now, when he\xe2\x80\x99d take off his new white beaver and make a bow\r\nand do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you\xe2\x80\x99d say\r\nhe had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus\r\nhimself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There\r\nwas a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about\r\nthree mile above the town\xe2\x80\x94been there a couple of hours, taking on\r\nfreight. Says the king:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeein\xe2\x80\x99 how I\xe2\x80\x99m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.\r\nLouis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat,\r\nHuckleberry; we\xe2\x80\x99ll come down to the village on her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I\r\nfetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went\r\nscooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come\r\nto a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log\r\nswabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather;\r\nand he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun her nose inshore,\xe2\x80\x9d says the king. I done it. \xe2\x80\x9cWher\xe2\x80\x99 you bound\r\nfor, young man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the steamboat; going to Orleans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGit aboard,\xe2\x80\x9d says the king. \xe2\x80\x9cHold on a minute, my servant \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99p you with them bags. Jump out and he\xe2\x80\x99p the gentleman,\r\nAdolphus\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94meaning me, I see.\r\n\r\nI done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was\r\nmighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such\r\nweather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning,\r\nand now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up\r\nthere. The young fellow says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first see you I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x99It\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he\r\ncome mighty near getting here in time.\xe2\x80\x99 But then I says again, \xe2\x80\x99No, I\r\nreckon it ain\xe2\x80\x99t him, or else he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be paddling up the river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYou _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ him, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my name\xe2\x80\x99s Blodgett\xe2\x80\x94Elexander Blodgett\xe2\x80\x94_Reverend_ Elexander\r\nBlodgett, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose I must say, as I\xe2\x80\x99m one o\xe2\x80\x99 the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s poor servants.\r\nBut still I\xe2\x80\x99m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving\r\nin time, all the same, if he\xe2\x80\x99s missed anything by it\xe2\x80\x94which I hope he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he don\xe2\x80\x99t miss any property by it, because he\xe2\x80\x99ll get that all\r\nright; but he\xe2\x80\x99s missed seeing his brother Peter die\xe2\x80\x94which he mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind, nobody can tell as to that\xe2\x80\x94but his brother would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 give\r\nanything in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about\r\nnothing else all these three weeks; hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen him since they was\r\nboys together\xe2\x80\x94and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever seen his brother William at all\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe deef and dumb one\xe2\x80\x94William ain\xe2\x80\x99t more than thirty or thirty-five.\r\nPeter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the\r\nmarried brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and\r\nWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s the only ones that\xe2\x80\x99s left now; and, as I was saying, they\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t got here in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid anybody send \xe2\x80\x99em word?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter\r\nsaid then that he sorter felt like he warn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get well this\r\ntime. You see, he was pretty old, and George\xe2\x80\x99s g\xe2\x80\x99yirls was too young\r\nto be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and\r\nso he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see\r\nHarvey\xe2\x80\x94and William, too, for that matter\xe2\x80\x94because he was one of them\r\nkind that can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for\r\nHarvey, and said he\xe2\x80\x99d told in it where his money was hid, and how he\r\nwanted the rest of the property divided up so George\xe2\x80\x99s g\xe2\x80\x99yirls would\r\nbe all right\xe2\x80\x94for George didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave nothing. And that letter was all\r\nthey could get him to put a pen to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you reckon Harvey don\xe2\x80\x99t come? Wher\xe2\x80\x99 does he live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he lives in England\xe2\x80\x94Sheffield\xe2\x80\x94preaches there\xe2\x80\x94hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ever been\r\nin this country. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had any too much time\xe2\x80\x94and besides he\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got the letter at all, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo bad, too bad he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 lived to see his brothers, poor\r\nsoul. You going to Orleans, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that ain\xe2\x80\x99t only a part of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m going in a ship, next\r\nWednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty long journey. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be lovely; I wisht I was\r\na-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary Jane\xe2\x80\x99s nineteen, Susan\xe2\x80\x99s fifteen, and Joanna\xe2\x80\x99s about\r\nfourteen\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the one that gives herself to good works and has a\r\nhare-lip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngoing to let them come to no harm. There\xe2\x80\x99s Hobson, the Babtis\xe2\x80\x99\r\npreacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,\r\nand Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the\r\nwidow Bartley, and\xe2\x80\x94well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of them; but these are the\r\nones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes,\r\nwhen he wrote home; so Harvey \xe2\x80\x99ll know where to look for friends when\r\nhe gets here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied\r\nthat young fellow. Blamed if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t inquire about everybody and\r\neverything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s business\xe2\x80\x94which was a tanner; and about George\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94which was a\r\ncarpenter; and about Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94which was a dissentering minister; and\r\nso on, and so on. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t stop\r\nthere. When they\xe2\x80\x99re deep they won\xe2\x80\x99t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat\r\nwill, but this is a St. Louis one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Peter Wilks well off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it\xe2\x80\x99s reckoned\r\nhe left three or four thousand in cash hid up som\xe2\x80\x99ers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you say he died?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say, but it was last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFuneral to-morrow, likely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, \xe2\x80\x99bout the middle of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s all terrible sad; but we\xe2\x80\x99ve all got to go, one time or\r\nanother. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way. Ma used to always say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon\r\nshe got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost\r\nmy ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up\r\nanother mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\r\ncarpet-bags. And if he\xe2\x80\x99s gone over to t\xe2\x80\x99other side, go over there and\r\ngit him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I\r\ngot back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a\r\nlog, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had\r\nsaid it\xe2\x80\x94every last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he\r\ntried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\r\na slouch. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imitate him, and so I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to try to; but\r\nhe really done it pretty good. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and\r\ndumb person on the histrionic boards. So then they waited for a\r\nsteamboat.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\r\nbut they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come from high enough up the river; but at last there\r\nwas a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went\r\naboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only\r\nwanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a\r\ncussing, and said they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t land us. But the king was ca\xe2\x80\x99m. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on\r\nand put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry \xe2\x80\x99em, can\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to\r\nthe village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down\r\nwhen they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKin any of you gentlemen tell me wher\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Peter Wilks lives?\xe2\x80\x9d they\r\ngive a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat \xe2\x80\x99d I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d Then one of them says, kind of soft and\r\ngentle:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_\r\nlive yesterday evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSudden as winking the ornery old cretur went all to smash, and fell up\r\nagainst the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his\r\nback, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, alas, our poor brother\xe2\x80\x94gone, and we never got to see him; oh,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s too, _too_ hard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to\r\nthe duke on his hands, and blamed if _he_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t drop a carpet-bag and\r\nbust out a-crying. If they warn\xe2\x80\x99t the beatenest lot, them two frauds,\r\nthat ever I struck.\r\n\r\nWell, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all\r\nsorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the\r\nhill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king\r\nall about his brother\xe2\x80\x99s last moments, and the king he told it all over\r\nagain on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that\r\ndead tanner like they\xe2\x80\x99d lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I\r\nstruck anything like it, I\xe2\x80\x99m a nigger. It was enough to make a body\r\nashamed of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the\r\npeople tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them\r\nputting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle\r\nof a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.\r\nThe windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would\r\nsay, over a fence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it _them?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the\r\nthree girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but\r\nthat don\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her\r\nface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her\r\nuncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped\r\nfor them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they _had_\r\nit! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet\r\nagain at last and have such good times.\r\n\r\nThen the king he hunched the duke private\xe2\x80\x94I see him do it\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nhe looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs;\r\nso then him and the duke, with a hand across each other\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\nand t\xe2\x80\x99other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there,\r\neverybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise\r\nstopping, people saying \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Sh!\xe2\x80\x9d and all the men taking their hats off\r\nand drooping their heads, so you could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 heard a pin fall. And when\r\nthey got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one\r\nsight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 heard them to\r\nOrleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other\xe2\x80\x99s necks,\r\nand hung their chins over each other\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders; and then for three\r\nminutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done.\r\nAnd, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that\r\ndamp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of\r\nthe coffin, and t\xe2\x80\x99other on t\xe2\x80\x99other side, and they kneeled down and\r\nrested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to\r\nthemselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you\r\nnever see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to\r\nsobbing right out loud\xe2\x80\x94the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly,\r\nwent up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn,\r\non the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up\r\ntowards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and\r\nwent off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never\r\nsee anything so disgusting.\r\n\r\nWell, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and\r\nworks himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and\r\nflapdoodle, about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother\r\nto lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long\r\njourney of four thousand mile, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a trial that\xe2\x80\x99s sweetened and\r\nsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he\r\nthanks them out of his heart and out of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s heart, because\r\nout of their mouths they can\xe2\x80\x99t, words being too weak and cold, and all\r\nthat kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he\r\nblubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes\r\nto crying fit to bust.\r\n\r\nAnd the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the\r\ncrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their\r\nmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church\r\nletting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and\r\nhogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and\r\nbully.\r\n\r\nThen the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his\r\nnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the\r\nfamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up\r\nwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying\r\nyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that\r\nwas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he\r\nwill name the same, to wit, as follows, viz.:\xe2\x80\x94Rev. Mr. Hobson, and\r\nDeacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi\r\nBell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.\r\n\r\nRev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was\r\naway up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so\r\nthey all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked\r\nto him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nnothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel\r\nof sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoo-goo\xe2\x80\x94goo-goo-goo\xe2\x80\x9d all the time, like a baby that can\xe2\x80\x99t talk.\r\n\r\nSo the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty\r\nmuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts\r\nof little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote\r\nhim the things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them\r\nout of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.\r\n\r\nThen Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the\r\nking he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house\r\nand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the\r\ntanyard (which was doing a good business), along with some other\r\nhouses and land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand\r\ndollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand\r\ncash was hid down cellar. So these two frauds said they\xe2\x80\x99d go and fetch\r\nit up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come\r\nwith a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found\r\nthe bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all\r\nthem yaller-boys. My, the way the king\xe2\x80\x99s eyes did shine! He slaps the\r\nduke on the shoulder and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _this_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t bully nor noth\xe2\x80\x99n! Oh, no, I reckon not! Why, Biljy,\r\nit beats the Nonesuch, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them\r\nthrough their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the\r\nking says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use talkin\xe2\x80\x99; bein\xe2\x80\x99 brothers to a rich dead man and\r\nrepresentatives of furrin heirs that\xe2\x80\x99s got left is the line for you\r\nand me, Bilge. Thish yer comes of trust\xe2\x80\x99n to Providence. It\xe2\x80\x99s the best\r\nway, in the long run. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried \xe2\x80\x99em all, and ther\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t no better\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMost everybody would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been satisfied with the pile, and took it on\r\ntrust; but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out\r\nfour hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen\r\ndollars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then\r\nthe duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nreckon that\xe2\x80\x99s the way of it. The best way\xe2\x80\x99s to let it go, and keep\r\nstill about it. We can spare it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t k\xe2\x80\x99yer noth\xe2\x80\x99n \xe2\x80\x99bout\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the _count_ I\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 about. We want to be awful square\r\nand open and above-board here, you know. We want to lug this h\xe2\x80\x99yer\r\nmoney up-stairs and count it before everybody\xe2\x80\x94then ther\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t noth\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nsuspicious. But when the dead man says ther\xe2\x80\x99s six thous\xe2\x80\x99n dollars, you\r\nknow, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on,\xe2\x80\x9d says the duke. \xe2\x80\x9cLe\xe2\x80\x99s make up the deffisit,\xe2\x80\x9d and he begun to\r\nhaul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a most amaz\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 good idea, duke\xe2\x80\x94you _have_ got a rattlin\xe2\x80\x99 clever\r\nhead on you,\xe2\x80\x9d says the king. \xe2\x80\x9cBlest if the old Nonesuch ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nheppin\xe2\x80\x99 us out ag\xe2\x80\x99in,\xe2\x80\x9d and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and\r\nstack them up.\r\n\r\nIt most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d says the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cI got another idea. Le\xe2\x80\x99s go up-stairs and count\r\nthis money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood land, duke, lemme hug you! It\xe2\x80\x99s the most dazzling idea \xe2\x80\x99at ever\r\na man struck. You have cert\xe2\x80\x99nly got the most astonishin\xe2\x80\x99 head I ever\r\nsee. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t no mistake \xe2\x80\x99bout it. Let\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to\xe2\x80\x94this \xe2\x80\x99ll lay \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the\r\nking he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a\r\npile\xe2\x80\x94twenty elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and\r\nlicked their chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see\r\nthe king begin to swell himself up for another speech. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by\r\nthem that\xe2\x80\x99s left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous\r\nby these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleft fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that\r\nhe would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done _more_ generous by \xe2\x80\x99em if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ben afeard o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwoundin\xe2\x80\x99 his dear William and me. Now, _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ he? Ther\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nquestion \xe2\x80\x99bout it in _my_ mind. Well, then, what kind o\xe2\x80\x99 brothers\r\nwould it be that \xe2\x80\x99d stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nuncles would it be that \xe2\x80\x99d rob\xe2\x80\x94yes, _rob_\xe2\x80\x94sech poor sweet lambs as\r\nthese \xe2\x80\x99at he loved so at sech a time? If I know William\xe2\x80\x94and I _think_\r\nI do\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll jest ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d He turns around and begins to make\r\na lot of signs to the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at\r\nhim stupid and leather-headed awhile; then all of a sudden he seems to\r\ncatch his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his\r\nmight for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.\r\nThen the king says, \xe2\x80\x9cI knowed it; I reckon _that_ \xe2\x80\x99ll convince anybody\r\nthe way _he_ feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94take it _all._ It\xe2\x80\x99s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but\r\njoyful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke,\r\nand then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And\r\neverybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the\r\nhands off of them frauds, saying all the time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _dear_ good souls!\xe2\x80\x94how _lovely!_\xe2\x80\x94how _could_ you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased\r\nagain, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and\r\nbefore long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,\r\nand stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody\r\nsaying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they\r\nwas all busy listening. The king was saying\xe2\x80\x94in the middle of\r\nsomething he\xe2\x80\x99d started in on\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94they bein\xe2\x80\x99 partickler friends o\xe2\x80\x99 the diseased. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ninvited here this evenin\xe2\x80\x99; but to-morrow we want _all_ to\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94everybody; for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and\r\nso it\xe2\x80\x99s fitten that his funeral orgies sh\xe2\x80\x99d be public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and\r\nevery little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the\r\nduke he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of\r\npaper, \xe2\x80\x9c_Obsequies_, you old fool,\xe2\x80\x9d and folds it up, and goes to\r\ngoo-gooing and reaching it over people\xe2\x80\x99s heads to him. The king he\r\nreads it and puts it in his pocket, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart\xe2\x80\x99s_ aluz right. Asks me\r\nto invite everybody to come to the funeral\xe2\x80\x94wants me to make \xe2\x80\x99em all\r\nwelcome. But he needn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 worried\xe2\x80\x94it was jest what I was at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he weaves along again, perfectly ca\xe2\x80\x99m, and goes to dropping in\r\nhis funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.\r\nAnd when he done it the third time he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say orgies, not because it\xe2\x80\x99s the common term, because it\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94obsequies bein\xe2\x80\x99 the common term\xe2\x80\x94but because orgies is the\r\nright term. Obsequies ain\xe2\x80\x99t used in England no more now\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s gone\r\nout. We say orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means\r\nthe thing you\xe2\x80\x99re after more exact. It\xe2\x80\x99s a word that\xe2\x80\x99s made up out\xe2\x80\x99n\r\nthe Greek _orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to\r\nplant, cover up; hence in_ter_. So, you see, funeral orgies is an open\r\ner public funeral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was the _worst_ I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed\r\nright in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\n_doctor!_\xe2\x80\x9d and Abner Shackleford says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Robinson, hain\xe2\x80\x99t you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Is_ it my poor brother\xe2\x80\x99s dear good friend and physician? I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your hands off me!\xe2\x80\x9d says the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ talk like an\r\nEnglishman, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ you? It\xe2\x80\x99s the worst imitation I ever heard. _You_\r\nPeter Wilks\xe2\x80\x99s brother! You\xe2\x80\x99re a fraud, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried\r\nto quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how\r\nHarvey\xe2\x80\x99s showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed\r\neverybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and\r\n_begged_ him not to hurt Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s feelings and the poor girls\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeelings, and all that. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use; he stormed right along,\r\nand said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar.\r\nThe poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a sudden\r\nthe doctor ups and turns on _them._ He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was your father\xe2\x80\x99s friend, and I\xe2\x80\x99m your friend; and I warn you _as_ a\r\nfriend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out\r\nof harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have\r\nnothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and\r\nHebrew, as he calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor\xe2\x80\x94has\r\ncome here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up\r\nsomewheres; and you take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool\r\nyourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know better.\r\nMary Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish\r\nfriend, too. Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out\xe2\x80\x94I _beg_\r\nyou to do it. Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Here_ is my answer.\xe2\x80\x9d She hove up the bag of money and put it in the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and says, \xe2\x80\x9cTake this six thousand dollars, and invest\r\nfor me and my sisters any way you want to, and don\xe2\x80\x99t give us no\r\nreceipt for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the\r\nhare-lip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and\r\nstomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his\r\nhead and smiled proud. The doctor says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x99s coming when you\xe2\x80\x99re going to feel sick whenever you think of\r\nthis day.\xe2\x80\x9d And away he went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d says the king, kinder mocking him; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll try and\r\nget \xe2\x80\x99em to send for you;\xe2\x80\x9d which made them all laugh, and they said it\r\nwas a prime good hit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was\r\noff for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would\r\ndo for Uncle William, and she\xe2\x80\x99d give her own room to Uncle Harvey,\r\nwhich was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her\r\nsisters and sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a\r\npallet in it. The king said the cubby would do for his valley\xe2\x80\x94meaning\r\nme.\r\n\r\nSo Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was\r\nplain but nice. She said she\xe2\x80\x99d have her frocks and a lot of other\r\ntraps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s way, but he\r\nsaid they warn\xe2\x80\x99t. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them\r\nwas a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There\r\nwas an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and\r\nall sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls\r\nbrisken up a room with. The king said it was all the more homely and\r\nmore pleasanter for these fixings, and so don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb them. The\r\nduke\xe2\x80\x99s room was pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my\r\ncubby.\r\n\r\nThat night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was\r\nthere, and I stood behind the king and the duke\xe2\x80\x99s chairs and waited on\r\nthem, and the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the\r\nhead of the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the\r\nbiscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough\r\nthe fried chickens was\xe2\x80\x94and all that kind of rot, the way women always\r\ndo for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything\r\nwas tiptop, and said so\xe2\x80\x94said \xe2\x80\x9cHow _do_ you get biscuits to brown so\r\nnice?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhere, for the land\xe2\x80\x99s sake, _did_ you get these amaz\xe2\x80\x99n\r\npickles?\xe2\x80\x9d and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people\r\nalways does at a supper, you know.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen\r\noff of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean\r\nup the things. The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and\r\nblest if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see the king?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have\xe2\x80\x94he goes to our church.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nknowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he\r\ngoes to our church, she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94regular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94regular. His pew\xe2\x80\x99s right over opposite ourn\xe2\x80\x94on t\xe2\x80\x99other side the\r\npulpit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he lived in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he does. Where _would_ he live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a\r\nchicken-bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean he goes to our church regular when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Sheffield. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly in the summer-time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how you talk\xe2\x80\x94Sheffield ain\xe2\x80\x99t on the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, who said it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_, nuther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never said nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what _did_ you say, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid he come to take the sea _baths_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, how\xe2\x80\x99s he going to take the sea baths if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t on the\r\nsea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here,\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cdid you ever see any Congress-water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, did you have to go to Congress to get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea\r\nbath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he get it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGets it the way people down here gets Congress-water\xe2\x80\x94in barrels.\r\nThere in the palace at Sheffield they\xe2\x80\x99ve got furnaces, and he wants\r\nhis water hot. They can\xe2\x80\x99t bile that amount of water away off there at\r\nthe sea. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t got no conveniences for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see, now. You might \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 said that in the first place and saved\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was\r\ncomfortable and glad. Next, she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you go to church, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94regular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you set?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, in our pew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Whose_ pew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _ourn_\xe2\x80\x94your Uncle Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis\xe2\x80\x99n? What does _he_ want with a pew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants it to set in. What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought he\xe2\x80\x99d be in the pulpit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so\r\nI played another chicken-bone and got another think. Then I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlame it, do you suppose there ain\xe2\x80\x99t but one preacher to a church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do they want with more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x94to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you.\r\nThey don\xe2\x80\x99t have no less than seventeen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t set out such a string as that,\r\nnot if I _never_ got to glory. It must take \xe2\x80\x99em a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks, they don\xe2\x80\x99t _all_ of \xe2\x80\x99em preach the same day\xe2\x80\x94only _one_ of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what does the rest of \xe2\x80\x99em do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate\xe2\x80\x94and one thing or\r\nanother. But mainly they don\xe2\x80\x99t do nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what are they _for_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they\xe2\x80\x99re for _style_. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that. How is\r\nservants treated in England? Do they treat \xe2\x80\x99em better \xe2\x80\x99n we treat our\r\nniggers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_No!_ A servant ain\xe2\x80\x99t nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they give \xe2\x80\x99em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweek, and Fourth of July?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just listen! A body could tell _you_ hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever been to England\r\nby that. Why, Hare-l\xe2\x80\x94why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s end to year\xe2\x80\x99s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor\r\nnigger shows, nor nowheres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _you_ always went to church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man\xe2\x80\x99s servant. But\r\nnext minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was\r\ndifferent from a common servant, and _had_ to go to church whether he\r\nwanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the\r\nlaw. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied. She says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonest injun, now, hain\xe2\x80\x99t you been telling me a lot of lies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonest injun,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of it at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of it at all. Not a lie in it,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay your hand on this book and say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI see it warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and\r\nsaid it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbelieve the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe, Jo?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mary Jane, stepping in with\r\nSusan behind her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t right nor kind for you to talk so to him,\r\nand him a stranger and so far from his people. How would you like to\r\nbe treated so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s always your way, Maim\xe2\x80\x94always sailing in to help somebody\r\nbefore they\xe2\x80\x99re hurt. I hain\xe2\x80\x99t done nothing to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s told some\r\nstretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t swallow it all; and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevery bit and grain I _did_ say. I reckon he can stand a little thing\r\nlike that, can\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether \xe2\x80\x99twas little or whether \xe2\x80\x99twas big; he\xe2\x80\x99s here in\r\nour house and a stranger, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good of you to say it. If you\r\nwas in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Maim, he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference what he _said_\xe2\x80\x94that ain\xe2\x80\x99t the thing. The\r\nthing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make\r\nhim remember he ain\xe2\x80\x99t in his own country and amongst his own folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I\xe2\x80\x99m letting that old reptile\r\nrob her of her money!\r\n\r\nThen Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me, she did give\r\nHare-lip hark from the tomb!\r\n\r\nSays I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I\xe2\x80\x99m letting him rob\r\nher of her money!\r\n\r\nThen Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94which was her way; but when she got done there warn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly\r\nanything left o\xe2\x80\x99 poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other girls; \xe2\x80\x9cyou just ask his pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful\r\nit was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so\r\nshe could do it again.\r\n\r\nI says to myself, this is _another_ one that I\xe2\x80\x99m letting him rob her\r\nof her money. And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves\r\nout to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so\r\nornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind\xe2\x80\x99s made up;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll hive that money for them or bust.\r\n\r\nSo then I lit out\xe2\x80\x94for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When\r\nI got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself,\r\nshall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\r\nmake it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndasn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they\xe2\x80\x99ve got the\r\nmoney, and they\xe2\x80\x99d slide right out and get away with it. If she was to\r\nfetch in help I\xe2\x80\x99d get mixed up in the business before it was done\r\nwith, I judge. No; there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no good way but one. I got to steal\r\nthat money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuspicion that I done it. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good thing here, and they\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to leave till they\xe2\x80\x99ve played this family and this town\r\nfor all they\xe2\x80\x99re worth, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll find a chance time enough. I\xe2\x80\x99ll steal\r\nit and hide it; and by and by, when I\xe2\x80\x99m away down the river, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwrite a letter and tell Mary Jane where it\xe2\x80\x99s hid. But I better hive it\r\nto-night if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t let up as much as\r\nhe lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.\r\n\r\nSo, thinks I, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was\r\ndark, but I found the duke\xe2\x80\x99s room, and started to paw around it with\r\nmy hands; but I recollected it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much like the king to let\r\nanybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went\r\nto his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nnothing without a candle, and I dasn\xe2\x80\x99t light one, of course. So I\r\njudged I\xe2\x80\x99d got to do the other thing\xe2\x80\x94lay for them and eavesdrop.\r\nAbout that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip\r\nunder the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t where I thought it\r\nwould be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane\xe2\x80\x99s frocks, so I\r\njumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood\r\nthere perfectly still.\r\n\r\nThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was\r\nto get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t found the\r\nbed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of natural to hide\r\nunder the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then,\r\nand the king says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it? And cut it middlin\xe2\x80\x99 short, because it\xe2\x80\x99s better for\r\nus to be down there a-whoopin\xe2\x80\x99 up the mournin\xe2\x80\x99 than up here givin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em\r\na chance to talk us over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is it, Capet. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t easy; I ain\xe2\x80\x99t comfortable. That\r\ndoctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nnotion, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a sound one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, duke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and\r\nclip it down the river with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got. Specially, seeing we got\r\nit so easy\xe2\x80\x94_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say,\r\nwhen of course we allowed to have to steal it back. I\xe2\x80\x99m for knocking\r\noff and lighting out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed.\r\nThe king rips out and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! And not sell out the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 the property? March off like a\r\npassel of fools and leave eight or nine thous\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nproperty layin\xe2\x80\x99 around jest sufferin\xe2\x80\x99 to be scooped in?\xe2\x80\x94and all good,\r\nsalable stuff, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to go no deeper\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to rob a lot of orphans of\r\n_everything_ they had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how you talk!\xe2\x80\x9d says the king. \xe2\x80\x9cWe sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t rob \xe2\x80\x99em of nothing at\r\nall but jest this money. The people that _buys_ the property is the\r\nsuff\xe2\x80\x99rers; because as soon \xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x99s found out \xe2\x80\x99at we didn\xe2\x80\x99t own\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94which won\xe2\x80\x99t be long after we\xe2\x80\x99ve slid\xe2\x80\x94the sale won\xe2\x80\x99t be valid, and\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99ll all go back to the estate. These yer orphans \xe2\x80\x99ll git their\r\nhouse back ag\xe2\x80\x99in, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for _them;_ they\xe2\x80\x99re young and\r\nspry, and k\xe2\x80\x99n easy earn a livin\xe2\x80\x99. _They_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to suffer. Why,\r\njest think\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s thous\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s and thous\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99s that ain\xe2\x80\x99t nigh so well\r\noff. Bless you, _they_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t got noth\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 to complain of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said\r\nall right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and\r\nthat doctor hanging over them. But the king says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCuss the doctor! What do we k\xe2\x80\x99yer for _him?_ Hain\xe2\x80\x99t we got all the\r\nfools in town on our side? And ain\xe2\x80\x99t that a big enough majority in any\r\ntown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they got ready to go down-stairs again. The duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we put that money in a good place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat cheered me up. I\xe2\x80\x99d begun to think I warn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get a hint of\r\nno kind to help me. The king says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Mary Jane \xe2\x80\x99ll be in mourning from this out; and first you\r\nknow the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these\r\nduds up and put \xe2\x80\x99em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across\r\nmoney and not borrow some of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour head\xe2\x80\x99s level ag\xe2\x80\x99in, duke,\xe2\x80\x9d says the king; and he comes\r\na-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I\r\nstuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I\r\nwondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I\r\ntried to think what I\xe2\x80\x99d better do if they did catch me. But the king\r\nhe got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought,\r\nand he never suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved the bag\r\nthrough a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and\r\ncrammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all\r\nright now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nturn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nno danger of getting stole now.\r\n\r\nBut I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way\r\ndown-stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I\r\ncould get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside of\r\nthe house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the\r\nhouse a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I turned in,\r\nwith my clothes all on; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 gone to sleep if I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By\r\nand by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my\r\npallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to\r\nsee if anything was going to happen. But nothing did.\r\n\r\nSo I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nI crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed\r\nalong, and got down-stairs all right. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t a sound anywheres. I\r\npeeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that\r\nwas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was\r\nopen into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a\r\ncandle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open;\r\nbut I see there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so\r\nI shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind\r\nme. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only\r\nplace I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved\r\nalong about a foot, showing the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s face down in there, with a\r\nwet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under\r\nthe lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me\r\ncreep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in\r\nbehind the door.\r\n\r\nThe person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft,\r\nand kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and\r\nI see she begun to cry, though I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear her, and her back was\r\nto me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d make\r\nsure them watchers hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and\r\neverything was all right. They hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stirred.\r\n\r\nI slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing\r\nplaying out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much\r\nresk about it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right;\r\nbecause when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write\r\nback to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen; the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s going to\r\nhappen is, the money\xe2\x80\x99ll be found when they come to screw on the lid.\r\nThen the king \xe2\x80\x99ll get it again, and it \xe2\x80\x99ll be a long day before he\r\ngives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I\r\n_wanted_ to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn\xe2\x80\x99t try it.\r\nEvery minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them\r\nwatchers would begin to stir, and I might get catched\xe2\x80\x94catched with\r\nsix thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn\xe2\x80\x99t hired me to take\r\ncare of. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I\r\nsays to myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I got down-stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the\r\nwatchers was gone. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody around but the family and the\r\nwidow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything\r\nhad been happening, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and\r\nthey set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs,\r\nand then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the\r\nneighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I\r\nsee the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn\xe2\x80\x99t go to look\r\nin under it, with folks around.\r\n\r\nThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took\r\nseats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an\r\nhour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at\r\nthe dead man\xe2\x80\x99s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was\r\nall very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding\r\nhandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing\r\na little. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on\r\nthe floor and blowing noses\xe2\x80\x94because people always blows them more at\r\na funeral than they do at other places except church.\r\n\r\nWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his\r\nblack gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last\r\ntouches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,\r\nand making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people\r\naround, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done\r\nit with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over\r\nagainst the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I\r\never see; and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no more smile to him than there is to a\r\nham.\r\n\r\nThey had borrowed a melodeum\xe2\x80\x94a sick one; and when everything was\r\nready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky\r\nand colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only\r\none that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend\r\nHobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off\r\nthe most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it\r\nwas only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it\r\nup right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and\r\nwait\xe2\x80\x94you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and\r\nnobody didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that\r\nlong-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you worry\xe2\x80\x94just depend on me.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he stooped down and begun\r\nto glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and\r\nmore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two\r\nsides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two\r\nseconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most\r\namazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the\r\nparson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two\r\nhere comes this undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s back and shoulders gliding along the wall\r\nagain; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and\r\nthen rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his\r\nneck out towards the preacher, over the people\xe2\x80\x99s heads, and says, in a\r\nkind of a coarse whisper, \xe2\x80\x9c_He had a rat!_\xe2\x80\x9d Then he drooped down and\r\nglided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great\r\nsatisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A\r\nlittle thing like that don\xe2\x80\x99t cost nothing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just the little\r\nthings that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nmore popular man in town than what that undertaker was.\r\n\r\nWell, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome;\r\nand then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage,\r\nand at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up\r\non the coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and\r\nwatched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the\r\nlid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So\r\nthere I was! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the money was in there or not. So,\r\nsays I, s\xe2\x80\x99pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?\xe2\x80\x94now how do\r\n_I_ know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S\xe2\x80\x99pose she dug him up\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says,\r\nI might get hunted up and jailed; I\xe2\x80\x99d better lay low and keep dark,\r\nand not write at all; the thing\xe2\x80\x99s awful mixed now; trying to better\r\nit, I\xe2\x80\x99ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I\xe2\x80\x99d just\r\nlet it alone, dad fetch the whole business!\r\n\r\nThey buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest easy. But nothing come\r\nof it; the faces didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me nothing.\r\n\r\nThe king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,\r\nand made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his\r\ncongregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must\r\nhurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was\r\nvery sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he\r\ncould stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\r\nAnd he said of course him and William would take the girls home with\r\nthem; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be\r\nwell fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the\r\nworld; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would\r\nbe ready. Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart\r\nache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see no\r\nsafe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.\r\n\r\nWell, blamed if the king didn\xe2\x80\x99t bill the house and the niggers and all\r\nthe property for auction straight off\xe2\x80\x94sale two days after the\r\nfuneral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nSo the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls\xe2\x80\x99\r\njoy got the first jolt. A couple of nigger-traders come along, and the\r\nking sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they\r\ncalled it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis,\r\nand their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls\r\nand them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around\r\neach other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The\r\ngirls said they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or\r\nsold away from the town. I can\xe2\x80\x99t ever get it out of my memory, the\r\nsight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 stood it all,\r\nbut would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t knowed\r\nthe sale warn\xe2\x80\x99t no account and the niggers would be back home in a\r\nweek or two.\r\n\r\nThe thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out\r\nflat-footed and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the\r\nchildren that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he\r\nbulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell\r\nyou the duke was powerful uneasy.\r\n\r\nNext day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king and\r\nthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look\r\nthat there was trouble. The king says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas you in my room night before last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, your majesty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which was the way I always called him when nobody\r\nbut our gang warn\xe2\x80\x99t around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas you in there yisterday er last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, your majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonor bright, now\xe2\x80\x94no lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonor bright, your majesty, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you the truth. I hain\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\na-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed\r\nit to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen anybody else go in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop and think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I see the niggers go in there several times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nexpected it, and then like they _had_. Then the duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, _all_ of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94leastways, not all at once\xe2\x80\x94that is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever see\r\nthem all come _out_ at once but just one time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello! When was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t early,\r\nbecause I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on, _go_ on! What did they do? How\xe2\x80\x99d they act?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t do nothing. And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t act anyway much, as fur as I\r\nsee. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they\xe2\x80\x99d shoved in\r\nthere to do up your majesty\xe2\x80\x99s room, or something, s\xe2\x80\x99posing you was up;\r\nand found you _warn\xe2\x80\x99t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the\r\nway of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t already waked you\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat guns, _this_ is a go!\xe2\x80\x9d says the king; and both of them looked\r\npretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and\r\nscratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a\r\nlittle raspy chuckle, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on\r\nto be _sorry_ they was going out of this region! And I believed they\r\n_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever tell\r\n_me_ any more that a nigger ain\xe2\x80\x99t got any histrionic talent. Why, the\r\nway they played that thing it would fool _anybody._ In my opinion,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a fortune in \xe2\x80\x99em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant a better lay-out than that\xe2\x80\x94and here we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone and sold \xe2\x80\x99em for\r\na song. Yes, and ain\xe2\x80\x99t privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where\r\n_is_ that song\xe2\x80\x94that draft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the bank for to be collected. Where _would_ it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ all right then, thank goodness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSays I, kind of timid-like:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs something gone wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king whirls on me and rips out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone o\xe2\x80\x99 your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y\xe2\x80\x99r own\r\naffairs\xe2\x80\x94if you got any. Long as you\xe2\x80\x99re in this town don\xe2\x80\x99t you forgit\r\n_that_\xe2\x80\x94you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d Then he says to the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cWe got to jest swaller\r\nit and say noth\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99: mum\xe2\x80\x99s the word for _us_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick sales _and_ small profits! It\xe2\x80\x99s a good business\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king snarls around on him and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to do for the best in sellin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em out so quick. If the\r\nprofits has turned out to be none, lackin\xe2\x80\x99 considable, and none to\r\ncarry, is it my fault any more\xe2\x80\x99n it\xe2\x80\x99s yourn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _they\xe2\x80\x99d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ if I could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngot my advice listened to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped\r\naround and lit into _me_ again. He give me down the banks for not\r\ncoming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting\r\nthat way\xe2\x80\x94said any fool would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 _knowed_ something was up. And then\r\nwaltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him\r\nnot laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nblamed if he\xe2\x80\x99d ever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt\r\ndreadful glad I\xe2\x80\x99d worked it all off onto the niggers, and yet hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndone the niggers no harm by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and\r\nstarted for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls\xe2\x80\x99 room the door was\r\nopen, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was\r\nopen and she\xe2\x80\x99d been packing things in it\xe2\x80\x94getting ready to go to\r\nEngland. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and\r\nhad her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of\r\ncourse anybody would. I went in there and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Mary Jane, you can\xe2\x80\x99t a-bear to see people in trouble, and _I_\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94most always. Tell me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she done it. And it was the niggers\xe2\x80\x94I just expected it. She said\r\nthe beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the\r\nmother and the children warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever going to see each other no\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear, to think they ain\xe2\x80\x99t _ever_ going to see each other\r\nany more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they _will_\xe2\x80\x94and inside of two weeks\xe2\x80\x94and I _know_ it!\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\nLaws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she\r\nthrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it\r\n_again_, say it _again!_\r\n\r\nI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close\r\nplace. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very\r\nimpatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and\r\neased-up, like a person that\xe2\x80\x99s had a tooth pulled out. So I went to\r\nstudying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells\r\nthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many\r\nresks, though I ain\xe2\x80\x99t had no experience, and can\xe2\x80\x99t say for certain;\r\nbut it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here\xe2\x80\x99s a case where I\xe2\x80\x99m blest\r\nif it don\xe2\x80\x99t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_\r\nthan a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time\r\nor other, it\xe2\x80\x99s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing\r\nlike it. Well, I says to myself at last, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to chance it;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most _like_\r\nsetting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll go to. Then I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where\r\nyou could go and stay three or four days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Mr. Lothrop\xe2\x80\x99s. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind why yet. If I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how I know the niggers will see\r\neach other again\xe2\x80\x94inside of two weeks\xe2\x80\x94here in this house\xe2\x80\x94and _prove_\r\nhow I know it\xe2\x80\x94will you go to Mr. Lothrop\xe2\x80\x99s and stay four days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour days!\xe2\x80\x9d she says; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay a year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want nothing more out of _you_ than just\r\nyour word\xe2\x80\x94I druther have it than another man\xe2\x80\x99s kiss-the-Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nsmiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll shut the door\xe2\x80\x94and bolt it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I come back and set down again, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to\r\ntell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no help for\r\nit. These uncles of yourn ain\xe2\x80\x99t no uncles at all; they\xe2\x80\x99re a couple of\r\nfrauds\xe2\x80\x94regular dead-beats. There, now we\xe2\x80\x99re over the worst of it, you\r\ncan stand the rest middling easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal\r\nwater now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher\r\nall the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first\r\nstruck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to\r\nwhere she flung herself onto the king\xe2\x80\x99s breast at the front door and\r\nhe kissed her sixteen or seventeen times\xe2\x80\x94and then up she jumps, with\r\nher face afire like sunset, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe brute! Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t waste a minute\xe2\x80\x94not a _second_\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nthem tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSays I:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCert\xe2\x80\x99nly. But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop\xe2\x80\x99s, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat am I _thinking_ about!\xe2\x80\x9d she says, and set right\r\ndown again. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind what I said\xe2\x80\x94please don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94you _won\xe2\x80\x99t_, now,\r\n_will_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that\r\nI said I would die first. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought, I was so stirred up,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsays; \xe2\x80\x9cnow go on, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t do so any more. You tell me what to do,\r\nand whatever you say I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I\xe2\x80\x99m fixed so\r\nI got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndruther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town\r\nwould get me out of their claws, and _I_\xe2\x80\x99d be all right; but there\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nanother person that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know about who\xe2\x80\x99d be in big trouble.\r\nWell, we got to save _him_, hain\xe2\x80\x99t we? Of course. Well, then, we won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nblow on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could\r\nget me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then\r\nleave. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to run the raft in the daytime without\r\nanybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the plan\r\nto begin working till pretty late to-night. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Mary Jane, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to\r\nstay at Mr. Lothrop\xe2\x80\x99s so long, nuther. How fur is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little short of four miles\xe2\x80\x94right out in the country, back here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that \xe2\x80\x99ll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till\r\nnine or half past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94tell them you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of something. If you get here before\r\neleven put a candle in this window, and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t turn up wait _till_\r\neleven, and _then_ if I don\xe2\x80\x99t turn up it means I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, and out of\r\nthe way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and\r\nget these beats jailed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it just happens so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t get away, but get took up\r\nalong with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing\r\nbeforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by you! indeed I will. They sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t touch a hair of your head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she\r\nsaid it, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I get away I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be here,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cto prove these\r\nrapscallions ain\xe2\x80\x99t your uncles, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it if I _was_ here.\r\nI could swear they was beats and bummers, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, though that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworth something. Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s others can do that better than what I\r\ncan, and they\xe2\x80\x99re people that ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to be doubted as quick as I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of\r\npaper. There\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99_Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville._\xe2\x80\x99 Put it away, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlose it. When the court wants to find out something about these two,\r\nlet them send up to Bricksville and say they\xe2\x80\x99ve got the men that\r\nplayed the \xe2\x80\x99Royal Nonesuch,\xe2\x80\x99 and ask for some witnesses\xe2\x80\x94why, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.\r\nAnd they\xe2\x80\x99ll come a-biling, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust let the auction go right along, and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Nobody don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction\r\non accounts of the short notice, and they ain\xe2\x80\x99t going out of this till\r\nthey get that money; and the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve fixed it the sale ain\xe2\x80\x99t going\r\nto count, and they ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to _get_ no money. It\xe2\x80\x99s just like the way\r\nit was with the niggers\xe2\x80\x94it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no sale, and the niggers will be\r\nback before long. Why, they can\xe2\x80\x99t collect the money for the _niggers_\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run down to breakfast now, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll start\r\nstraight for Mr. Lothrop\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Deed, _that_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cby no\r\nmanner of means; go _before_ breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never thought\xe2\x80\x94and come to think, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s because you ain\xe2\x80\x99t one of these leather-face people. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and\r\nread it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your\r\nuncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, don\xe2\x80\x99t! Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go before breakfast\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to.\r\nAnd leave my sisters with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; never mind about them. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stand it yet awhile. They\r\nmight suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to\r\nsee them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was\r\nto ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.\r\nNo, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix it with all of\r\nthem. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change,\r\nor to see a friend, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be back to-night or early in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone to see a friend is all right, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t have my love given to\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be.\xe2\x80\x9d It was well enough to tell _her_ so\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nharm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe little things that smooths people\xe2\x80\x99s roads the most, down here\r\nbelow; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost\r\nnothing. Then I says: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one more thing\xe2\x80\x94that bag of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think\r\n_how_ they got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99re out, there. They hain\xe2\x80\x99t got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, who\xe2\x80\x99s got it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I knowed, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I _had_ it, because I stole it from\r\nthem; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it ain\xe2\x80\x99t there no more. I\xe2\x80\x99m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did\r\nhonest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the\r\nfirst place I come to, and run\xe2\x80\x94and it warn\xe2\x80\x99t a good place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop blaming yourself\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad to do it, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault. Where did you hide\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that\r\ncorpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So\r\nfor a minute I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing; then I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind letting me off; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll write it for you on a piece of\r\npaper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop\xe2\x80\x99s, if you\r\nwant to. Do you reckon that \xe2\x80\x99ll do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was\r\ncrying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was\r\nmighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by\r\nherself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own\r\nroof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it\r\nto her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by\r\nthe hand, hard, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Good_-by. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do everything just as you\xe2\x80\x99ve told me; and if\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t ever see you again, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t ever forget you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll think\r\nof you a many and a many a time, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll _pray_ for you, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshe was gone.\r\n\r\nPray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she\xe2\x80\x99d take a job that was\r\nmore nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\njust that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the\r\nnotion\xe2\x80\x94there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what\r\nyou want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl\r\nI ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like\r\nflattery, but it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no flattery. And when it comes to beauty\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ngoodness, too\xe2\x80\x94she lays over them all. I hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever seen her since\r\nthat time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever seen\r\nher since, but I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of her a many and a many a\r\nmillion times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 thought it would do any good for me to pray for _her_, blamed\r\nif I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it or bust.\r\n\r\nWell, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see\r\nher go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the name of them people over on t\xe2\x80\x99other side of the river that\r\nyou all goes to see sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s several; but it\xe2\x80\x99s the Proctors, mainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the name,\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cI most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she\r\ntold me to tell you she\xe2\x80\x99s gone over there in a dreadful hurry\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x99s sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSakes alive, I hope it ain\xe2\x80\x99t _Hanner_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say it,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Hanner\xe2\x80\x99s the very one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary\r\nJane said, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99ll last many hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think of that, now! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMumps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMumps your granny! They don\xe2\x80\x99t set up with people that\xe2\x80\x99s got the\r\nmumps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.\r\nThese mumps is different. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s it a new kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s mixed up with other things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat other things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption,\r\nand yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy land! And they call it the _mumps_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Miss Mary Jane said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, because it _is_ the mumps. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it starts with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ther\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and\r\ntake pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his\r\nbrains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some\r\nnumskull up and say, \xe2\x80\x99Why, he stumped his _toe_.\xe2\x80\x99 Would ther\xe2\x80\x99 be any\r\nsense in that? _No_. And ther\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t no sense in _this_, nuther. Is it\r\nketching?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it _ketching?_ Why, how you talk. Is a _harrow_ catching\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\ndark? If you don\xe2\x80\x99t hitch on to one tooth, you\xe2\x80\x99re bound to on another,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t you? And you can\xe2\x80\x99t get away with that tooth without fetching the\r\nwhole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a\r\nharrow, as you may say\xe2\x80\x94and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no slouch of a harrow, nuther,\r\nyou come to get it hitched on good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s awful, _I_ think,\xe2\x80\x9d says the hare-lip. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Uncle\r\nHarvey and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI _would._ Of _course_ I would. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose no\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain\xe2\x80\x99t your uncles\r\nobleeged to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you\r\nreckon they\xe2\x80\x99d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that\r\njourney by yourselves? _You_ know they\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for you. So fur, so\r\ngood. Your uncle Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s a preacher, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he? Very well, then; is a\r\n_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive\r\na _ship clerk?_\xe2\x80\x94so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?\r\nNow _you_ know he ain\xe2\x80\x99t. What _will_ he do, then? Why, he\xe2\x80\x99ll say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99It\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the\r\nbest way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful\r\npluribus-unum mumps, and so it\xe2\x80\x99s my bounden duty to set down here and\r\nwait the three months it takes to show on her if she\xe2\x80\x99s got it.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nnever mind, if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s best to tell your uncle Harvey\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good\r\ntimes in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyway, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d better tell some of the neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou _see_ that _they\xe2\x80\x99d_ go and tell? Ther\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t no way but just to\r\nnot tell anybody at _all_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re right\xe2\x80\x94yes, I judge you _are_ right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she\xe2\x80\x99s gone out awhile,\r\nanyway, so he won\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, \xe2\x80\x99Tell them\r\nto give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I\xe2\x80\x99ve run\r\nover the river to see Mr.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\xe2\x80\x94what _is_ the name of that rich\r\nfamily your uncle Peter used to think so much of?\xe2\x80\x94I mean the one\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you must mean the Apthorps, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; bother them kind of names, a body can\xe2\x80\x99t ever seem to\r\nremember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run\r\nover for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and\r\nbuy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they\r\nhad it than anybody else; and she\xe2\x80\x99s going to stick to them till they\r\nsay they\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and then, if she ain\xe2\x80\x99t too tired, she\xe2\x80\x99s coming home;\r\nand if she is, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be home in the morning anyway. She said, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps\xe2\x80\x94which \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe perfectly true, because she _is_ going there to speak about their\r\nbuying the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and\r\ngive them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.\r\n\r\nEverything was all right now. The girls wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing because\r\nthey wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther\r\nMary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of\r\nDoctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty\r\nneat\xe2\x80\x94I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it no neater himself. Of\r\ncourse he would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 throwed more style into it, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that\r\nvery handy, not being brung up to it.\r\n\r\nWell, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the\r\nend of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the\r\nold man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there\r\nlongside of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and\r\nthen, or a little goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was\r\naround goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading\r\nhimself generly.\r\n\r\nBut by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was\r\nsold\xe2\x80\x94everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d got to work _that_ off\xe2\x80\x94I never see such a girafft as the king\r\nwas for wanting to swallow _everything_. Well, whilst they was at it a\r\nsteamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping\r\nand yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Here\xe2\x80\x99s_ your opposition line! here\xe2\x80\x99s your two sets o\xe2\x80\x99 heirs to old\r\nPeter Wilks\xe2\x80\x94and you pays your money and you takes your choice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThey was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a\r\nnice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my\r\nsouls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the\r\nking some to see any. I reckoned they\xe2\x80\x99d turn pale. But no, nary a pale\r\ndid _they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up,\r\nbut just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and\r\ngazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the\r\nstomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and\r\nrascals in the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal\r\npeople gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.\r\nThat old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.\r\nPretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced\r\n_like_ an Englishman\xe2\x80\x94not the king\xe2\x80\x99s way, though the king\xe2\x80\x99s _was_\r\npretty good for an imitation. I can\xe2\x80\x99t give the old gent\xe2\x80\x99s words, nor I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a surprise to me which I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nacknowledge, candid and frank, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t very well fixed to meet it and\r\nanswer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he\xe2\x80\x99s broke his\r\narm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in\r\nthe night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks\xe2\x80\x99s brother Harvey, and this is\r\nhis brother William, which can\xe2\x80\x99t hear nor speak\xe2\x80\x94and can\xe2\x80\x99t even make\r\nsigns to amount to much, now\xe2\x80\x99t he\xe2\x80\x99s only got one hand to work them\r\nwith. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the\r\nbaggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing more,\r\nbut go to the hotel and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and\r\nblethers out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBroke his arm\xe2\x80\x94_very_ likely, _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ it?\xe2\x80\x94and very convenient, too,\r\nfor a fraud that\xe2\x80\x99s got to make signs, and ain\xe2\x80\x99t learnt how. Lost their\r\nbaggage! That\xe2\x80\x99s _mighty_ good!\xe2\x80\x94and mighty ingenious\xe2\x80\x94under the\r\n_circumstances!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,\r\nor maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a\r\nsharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind\r\nmade out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and\r\nwas talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now\r\nand then and nodding their heads\xe2\x80\x94it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that\r\nwas gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that\r\ncome along and listened to all the old gentlemen said, and was\r\nlistening to the king now. And when the king got done this husky up\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when\xe2\x80\x99d you come to this\r\ntown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day before the funeral, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d says the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what time o\xe2\x80\x99 day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the evenin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99bout an hour er two before sundown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come down on the _Susan Powell_ from Cincinnati.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, how\xe2\x80\x99d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94in\r\na canoe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warn\xe2\x80\x99t up at the Pint in the mornin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to\r\nan old man and a preacher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreacher be hanged, he\xe2\x80\x99s a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint\r\nthat mornin\xe2\x80\x99. I live up there, don\xe2\x80\x99t I? Well, I was up there, and he\r\nwas up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim\r\nCollins and a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor he up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon I would, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know\r\nhim perfectly easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was me he pointed at. The doctor says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeighbors, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but\r\nif _these_ two ain\xe2\x80\x99t frauds, I am an idiot, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nour duty to see that they don\xe2\x80\x99t get away from here till we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked\r\ninto this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t\xe2\x80\x99other couple,\r\nand I reckon we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out _something_ before we get through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king\xe2\x80\x99s friends; so\r\nwe all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by\r\nthe hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let _go_ my hand.\r\n\r\nWe all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and\r\nfetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be too hard on these two men, but _I_ think they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfrauds, and they may have complices that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing about.\r\nIf they have, won\xe2\x80\x99t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter\r\nWilks left? It ain\xe2\x80\x99t unlikely. If these men ain\xe2\x80\x99t frauds, they won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they\r\nprove they\xe2\x80\x99re all right\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty\r\ntight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked\r\nsorrowful, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no disposition\r\nto throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out\r\ninvestigation o\xe2\x80\x99 this misable business; but, alas, the money ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere; you k\xe2\x80\x99n send and see, if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it\r\ninside o\xe2\x80\x99 the straw tick o\xe2\x80\x99 my bed, not wishin\xe2\x80\x99 to bank it for the few\r\ndays we\xe2\x80\x99d be here, and considerin\xe2\x80\x99 the bed a safe place, we not bein\xe2\x80\x99\r\nused to niggers, and suppos\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em honest, like servants in England.\r\nThe niggers stole it the very next mornin\xe2\x80\x99 after I had went\r\ndown-stairs; and when I sold \xe2\x80\x99em I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t missed the money yit, so\r\nthey got clean away with it. My servant here k\xe2\x80\x99n tell you \xe2\x80\x99bout it,\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor and several said \xe2\x80\x9cShucks!\xe2\x80\x9d and I see nobody didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naltogether believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal\r\nit. I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling\r\naway, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid\r\nthey had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made\r\ntrouble with them. That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls\r\non me and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre _you_ English, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cStuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we\r\nhad it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word\r\nabout supper, nor ever seemed to think about it\xe2\x80\x94and so they kept it\r\nup, and kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever\r\nsee. They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman\r\ntell his\xe2\x80\x99n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99\r\n_seen_ that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t\xe2\x80\x99other one lies.\r\nAnd by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give\r\nme a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed\r\nenough to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and\r\nhow we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell,\r\nthe lawyer, says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet down, my boy; I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t strain myself if I was you. I reckon you\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t used to lying, it don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to come handy; what you want is\r\npractice. You do it pretty awkward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let\r\noff, anyway.\r\n\r\nThe doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99d been in town at first, Levi Bell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king broke in and reached out his hand, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, is this my poor dead brother\xe2\x80\x99s old friend that he\xe2\x80\x99s wrote so\r\noften about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\r\npleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side\r\nand talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat \xe2\x80\x99ll fix it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the order and send it, along with your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll know it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\r\nhis head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off\r\nsomething; and then they give the pen to the duke\xe2\x80\x94and then for the\r\nfirst time the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So\r\nthen the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read it. The lawyer\r\nlooked powerful astonished, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it beats _me_\xe2\x80\x94and snaked a lot of old letters out of his\r\npocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man\xe2\x80\x99s writing,\r\nand then _them_ again; and then says: \xe2\x80\x9cThese old letters is from\r\nHarvey Wilks; and here\xe2\x80\x99s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see\r\n_they_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t write them\xe2\x80\x9d (the king and the duke looked sold and\r\nfoolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s _this_ old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, and anybody can tell, easy\r\nenough, _he_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t write them\xe2\x80\x94fact is, the scratches he makes ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nproperly _writing_ at all. Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s some letters from\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe new old gentleman says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94so he copies for me. It\xe2\x80\x99s _his_ hand you\xe2\x80\x99ve got there, not\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Well!_\xe2\x80\x9d says the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cthis _is_ a state of things. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some\r\nof William\xe2\x80\x99s letters, too; so if you\xe2\x80\x99ll get him to write a line or so\r\nwe can com\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ write with his left hand,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\r\ncould use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\r\nand mine too. Look at both, please\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re by the same hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer done it, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it\xe2\x80\x99s so\xe2\x80\x94and if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t so, there\xe2\x80\x99s a heap stronger\r\nresemblance than I\xe2\x80\x99d noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I\r\nthought we was right on the track of a slution, but it\xe2\x80\x99s gone to\r\ngrass, partly. But anyway, _one_ thing is proved\xe2\x80\x94_these_ two ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neither of \xe2\x80\x99em Wilkses\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he wagged his head towards the king and\r\nthe duke.\r\n\r\nWell, what do you think? That mule-headed old fool wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give in\r\n_then!_ Indeed he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Said it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no fair test. Said his\r\nbrother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_tried_ to write\xe2\x80\x94_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes\r\nthe minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went\r\nwarbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he\r\nwas saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay\r\nout my br\xe2\x80\x94helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says somebody, \xe2\x80\x9cme and Ab Turner done it. We\xe2\x80\x99re both here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the old man turns toward the king, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeraps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlamed if the king didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to brace up mighty quick, or he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\r\nhim so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to\r\nmake most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that\r\nwithout any notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was\r\ntattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it; and\r\nit was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards\r\nand gazing at him. Says I to myself, _Now_ he\xe2\x80\x99ll throw up the\r\nsponge\xe2\x80\x94there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no more use. Well, did he? A body can\xe2\x80\x99t hardly\r\nbelieve it, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I reckon he thought he\xe2\x80\x99d keep the thing up\r\ntill he tired them people out, so they\xe2\x80\x99d thin out, and him and the\r\nduke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty\r\nsoon he begun to smile, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMf! It\xe2\x80\x99s a _very_ tough question, _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ it! _Yes_, sir, I k\xe2\x80\x99n tell\r\nyou what\xe2\x80\x99s tattooed on his breast. It\xe2\x80\x99s jest a small, thin, blue\r\narrow\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is; and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t look clost, you can\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nit. _Now_ what do you say\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, _I_ never see anything like that old blister for clean\r\nout-and-out cheek.\r\n\r\nThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\r\nhis eye lights up like he judged he\xe2\x80\x99d got the king _this_ time, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter\r\nWilks\xe2\x80\x99s breast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth of them spoke up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t see no such mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d says the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what you _did_ see on his breast\r\nwas a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\r\nyoung), and a W, and dashes between them, so: P\xe2\x80\x94B\xe2\x80\x94W\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he marked\r\nthem that way on a piece of paper. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, ain\xe2\x80\x99t that what you saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth of them spoke up again, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_. We never seen any marks at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole _bilin\xe2\x80\x99_ of \xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99s frauds! Le\xe2\x80\x99s duck \xe2\x80\x99em! le\xe2\x80\x99s drown \xe2\x80\x99em!\r\nle\xe2\x80\x99s ride \xe2\x80\x99em on a rail!\xe2\x80\x9d and everybody was whooping at once, and\r\nthere was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and\r\nyells, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen\xe2\x80\x94gentle_men!_ Hear me just a word\xe2\x80\x94just a _single_ word\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nyou PLEASE! There\xe2\x80\x99s one way yet\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s go and dig up the corpse and\r\nlook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat took them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\r\nand the doctor sung out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\r\n_them_ along, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll do it!\xe2\x80\x9d they all shouted; \xe2\x80\x9cand if we don\xe2\x80\x99t find them marks\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll lynch the whole gang!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI _was_ scared, now, I tell you. But there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no getting away, you\r\nknow. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for\r\nthe graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the\r\nwhole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only\r\nnine in the evening.\r\n\r\nAs we went by our house I wished I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t sent Mary Jane out of town;\r\nbecause now if I could tip her the wink she\xe2\x80\x99d light out and save me,\r\nand blow on our dead-beats.\r\n\r\nWell, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\r\nwildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\r\nlightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver\r\namongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most\r\ndangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was\r\ngoing so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed\r\nso I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and\r\nhave Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the\r\nclose-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden\r\ndeath but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t find them\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nabout nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful\r\ntime to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\r\nwrist\xe2\x80\x94Hines\xe2\x80\x94and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He\r\ndragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep\r\nup.\r\n\r\nWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\r\nlike an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had\r\nabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway\r\nby the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house,\r\na half a mile off, to borrow one.\r\n\r\nSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the\r\nrain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the\r\nlightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them\r\npeople never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business;\r\nand one minute you could see everything and every face in that big\r\ncrowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the\r\nnext second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see nothing at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then\r\nsuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to\r\nscrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way,\r\nit was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,\r\nand I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and\r\npanting.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,\r\nand somebody sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the living jingo, here\xe2\x80\x99s the bag of gold on his breast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and\r\ngive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit\r\nout and shinned for the road in the dark there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nobody can tell.\r\n\r\nI had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew\xe2\x80\x94leastways, I had it\r\nall to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and\r\nthe buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the\r\nsplitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it\r\nalong!\r\n\r\nWhen I struck the town I see there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody out in the storm, so\r\nI never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the\r\nmain one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and\r\nset it. No light there; the house all dark\xe2\x80\x94which made me feel sorry\r\nand disappointed, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why. But at last, just as I was\r\nsailing by, _flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane\xe2\x80\x99s window! and my\r\nheart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house\r\nand all was behind me in the dark, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ever going to be before\r\nme no more in this world. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had\r\nthe most sand.\r\n\r\nThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the\r\ntowhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first\r\ntime the lightning showed me one that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t chained I snatched it and\r\nshoved. It was a canoe, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t fastened with nothing but a rope.\r\nThe towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the\r\nmiddle of the river, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose no time; and when I struck the\r\nraft at last I was so fagged I would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 just laid down to blow and\r\ngasp if I could afforded it. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. As I sprung aboard I sung\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nshut of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so\r\nfull of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up\r\nin my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old\r\nKing Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the\r\nlivers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to\r\nhug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was\r\nshut of the king and the duke, but I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and\r\nlet her slide!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_\r\nseem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river,\r\nand nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and\r\ncrack my heels a few times\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it; but about the third\r\ncrack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath\r\nand listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted\r\nout over the water, here they come!\xe2\x80\x94and just a-laying to their oars\r\nand making their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke.\r\n\r\nSo I wilted right down onto the planks then, and give up; and it was\r\nall I could do to keep from crying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTryin\xe2\x80\x99 to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company,\r\nhey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, your majesty, we warn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94_please_ don\xe2\x80\x99t, your majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll shake the\r\ninsides out o\xe2\x80\x99 you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonest, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.\r\nThe man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he\r\nhad a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to\r\nsee a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by\r\nsurprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets\r\ngo of me and whispers, \xe2\x80\x99Heel it now, or they\xe2\x80\x99ll hang ye, sure!\xe2\x80\x99 and I\r\nlit out. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem no good for _me_ to stay\xe2\x80\x94_I_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nnothing, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be _hung_ if I could get away. So I\r\nnever stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I\r\ntold Jim to hurry, or they\xe2\x80\x99d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was\r\nafeard you and the duke wasn\xe2\x80\x99t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and\r\nso was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim\r\nif I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nyes, it\xe2\x80\x99s _mighty_ likely!\xe2\x80\x9d and shook me up again, and said he reckoned\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d drownd me. But the duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeggo the boy, you old idiot! Would _you_ \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done any different?\r\nDid you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose? _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t remember\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in\r\nit. But the duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou better a blame\xe2\x80\x99 sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthe one that\xe2\x80\x99s entitled to it most. You hain\xe2\x80\x99t done a thing from the\r\nstart that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky\r\nwith that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That _was_ bright\xe2\x80\x94it was right\r\ndown bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nfor that they\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 jailed us till them Englishmen\xe2\x80\x99s baggage come\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took \xe2\x80\x99em to the\r\ngraveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the\r\nexcited fools hadn\xe2\x80\x99t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 slept in our cravats to-night\xe2\x80\x94cravats warranted to _wear_,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94longer than _we\xe2\x80\x99d_ need \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey was still a minute\xe2\x80\x94thinking; then the king says, kind of\r\nabsent-minded like:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMf! And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat made me squirm!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, \xe2\x80\x9c_we_\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter about a half a minute the king drawls out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeastways, _I_ did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke says, the same way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, _I_ did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king kind of ruffles up, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here, Bilgewater, what\xe2\x80\x99r you referrin\xe2\x80\x99 to?\xe2\x80\x9d The duke says,\r\npretty brisk:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to that, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me ask what was _you_\r\nreferring to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks!\xe2\x80\x9d says the king, very sarcastic; \xe2\x80\x9cbut _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94maybe\r\nyou was asleep, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what you was about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke bristles up now, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfool? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon _I_ know who hid that money in that coffin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Yes_, sir! I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the duke went for him. The king sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake y\xe2\x80\x99r hands off!\xe2\x80\x94leggo my throat!\xe2\x80\x94I take it all back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,\r\nintending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig\r\nit up, and have it all to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait jest a minute, duke\xe2\x80\x94answer me this one question, honest and\r\nfair; if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t put the money there, say it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll b\xe2\x80\x99lieve you,\r\nand take back everything I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou old scoundrel, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and you know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. There, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more\xe2\x80\x94now\r\n_don\xe2\x80\x99t_ git mad; didn\xe2\x80\x99t you have it in your _mind_ to hook the money and\r\nhide it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if I _did_, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t _do_ it, anyway. But you not\r\nonly had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that\xe2\x80\x99s honest. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay I warn\xe2\x80\x99t _goin\xe2\x80\x99_ to do it, because I _was_; but you\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x94got in ahead o\xe2\x80\x99 me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie! You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Nough!\xe2\x80\x94_I own up!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier\r\nthan what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ever deny it again I\xe2\x80\x99ll drown you. It\xe2\x80\x99s _well_ for you to set\r\nthere and blubber like a baby\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s fitten for you, after the way\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x94and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own\r\nfather. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it\r\nsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nIt makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_\r\nthat rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make\r\nup the deffisit\xe2\x80\x94you wanted to get what money I\xe2\x80\x99d got out of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonesuch\xe2\x80\x99 and one thing or another, and scoop it _all!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, duke, it was you that said make up the deffersit; it warn\xe2\x80\x99t me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDry up! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear no more _out_ of you!\xe2\x80\x9d says the duke. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\n_now_ you see what you _got_ by it. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got all their own money\r\nback, and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_. G\xe2\x80\x99long to bed,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long \xe2\x80\x99s _you_ live!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for\r\ncomfort, and before long the duke tackled _his_ bottle; and so in\r\nabout a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the\r\ntighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about\r\nhiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of\r\ncourse when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe dasn\xe2\x80\x99t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along\r\ndown the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a\r\nmighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish\r\nmoss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It\r\nwas the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn\r\nand dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and\r\nthey begun to work the villages again.\r\n\r\nFirst they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t make enough\r\nfor them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a\r\ndancing-school; but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know no more how to dance than a\r\nkangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped\r\nin and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at\r\nyellocution; but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t yellocute long till the audience got up\r\nand give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They\r\ntackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling\r\nfortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have\r\nno luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around\r\nthe raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying\r\nnothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\r\n\r\nAnd at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together\r\nin the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a\r\ntime. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the look of it. We judged\r\nthey was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned\r\nit over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to\r\nbreak into somebody\xe2\x80\x99s house or store, or was going into the\r\ncounterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty\r\nscared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have nothing in the\r\nworld to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we\r\nwould give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind.\r\nWell, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about\r\ntwo mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and\r\nthe king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up\r\nto town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoyal Nonesuch\xe2\x80\x9d there yet. (\xe2\x80\x9cHouse to rob, you _mean_,\xe2\x80\x9d says I to\r\nmyself; \xe2\x80\x9cand when you get through robbing it you\xe2\x80\x99ll come back here and\r\nwonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\r\ntake it out in wondering.\xe2\x80\x9d) And he said if he warn\xe2\x80\x99t back by midday\r\nthe duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.\r\n\r\nSo we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and\r\nwas in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little\r\nthing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday\r\ncome and no king; we could have a change, anyway\xe2\x80\x94and maybe a chance\r\nfor _the_ chance on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the\r\nvillage, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found\r\nhim in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of\r\nloafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening\r\nwith all his might, and so tight he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nnothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and\r\nthe king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I\r\nlit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the\r\nriver road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind\r\nthat it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I\r\ngot down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet her loose, Jim; we\xe2\x80\x99re all right now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was\r\ngone! I set up a shout\xe2\x80\x94and then another\xe2\x80\x94and then another one; and\r\nrun this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t no use\xe2\x80\x94old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the\r\nroad, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy\r\nwalking, and asked him if he\xe2\x80\x99d seen a strange nigger dressed so and\r\nso, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereabouts?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown to Silas Phelps\xe2\x80\x99s place, two mile below here. He\xe2\x80\x99s a runaway\r\nnigger, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve got him. Was you looking for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet I ain\xe2\x80\x99t! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two\r\nago, and he said if I hollered he\xe2\x80\x99d cut my livers out\xe2\x80\x94and told me to\r\nlay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since;\r\nafeard to come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afeard no more, becuz they\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nhim. He run off f\xe2\x80\x99m down South som\xe2\x80\x99ers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good job they got him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I _reckon!_ There\xe2\x80\x99s two hundred dollars reward on him.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like picking up money out\xe2\x80\x99n the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is\xe2\x80\x94and _I_ could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 had it if I\xe2\x80\x99d been big enough; I see him\r\n_first_. Who nailed him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an old fellow\xe2\x80\x94a stranger\xe2\x80\x94and he sold out his chance in him\r\nfor forty dollars, becuz he\xe2\x80\x99s got to go up the river and can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.\r\nThink o\xe2\x80\x99 that, now! You bet _I\xe2\x80\x99d_ wait, if it was seven year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s me, every time,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cBut maybe his chance ain\xe2\x80\x99t worth no\r\nmore than that, if he\xe2\x80\x99ll sell it so cheap. Maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t straight about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it _is_, though\xe2\x80\x94straight as a string. I see the handbill myself.\r\nIt tells all about him, to a dot\xe2\x80\x94paints him like a picture, and tells\r\nthe plantation he\xe2\x80\x99s frum, below Newr_leans_. No-sirree-_bob_, they\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no trouble \xe2\x80\x99bout _that_ speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a\r\nchaw tobacker, won\xe2\x80\x99t ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in\r\nthe wigwam to think. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to nothing. I thought till I\r\nwore my head sore, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no way out of the trouble. After\r\nall this long journey, and after all we\xe2\x80\x99d done for them scoundrels,\r\nhere it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined,\r\nbecause they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that,\r\nand make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too,\r\nfor forty dirty dollars.\r\n\r\nOnce I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to\r\nbe a slave at home where his family was, as long as he\xe2\x80\x99d _got_ to be a\r\nslave, and so I\xe2\x80\x99d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to\r\ntell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two\r\nthings: she\xe2\x80\x99d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness\r\nfor leaving her, and so she\xe2\x80\x99d sell him straight down the river again;\r\nand if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,\r\nand they\xe2\x80\x99d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he\xe2\x80\x99d feel ornery and\r\ndisgraced. And then think of _me!_ It would get all around that Huck\r\nFinn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see\r\nanybody from that town again I\xe2\x80\x99d be ready to get down and lick his\r\nboots for shame. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way: a person does a low-down thing,\r\nand then he don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long\r\nas he can hide, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The\r\nmore I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me,\r\nand the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at\r\nlast, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of\r\nProvidence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness\r\nwas being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was\r\nstealing a poor old woman\xe2\x80\x99s nigger that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever done me no harm,\r\nand now was showing me there\xe2\x80\x99s One that\xe2\x80\x99s always on the lookout, and\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur\r\nand no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I\r\ntried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by\r\nsaying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn\xe2\x80\x99t so much to blame; but\r\nsomething inside of me kept saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was the Sunday-school, you\r\ncould \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 gone to it; and if you\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it they\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 learnt you\r\nthere that people that acts as I\xe2\x80\x99d been acting about that nigger goes\r\nto everlasting fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I\r\nkneeled down. But the words wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they? It\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from _me_, neither. I\r\nknowed very well why they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come. It was because my heart\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t right; it was because I warn\xe2\x80\x99t square; it was because I was\r\nplaying double. I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of\r\nme I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my\r\nmouth _say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and\r\nwrite to that nigger\xe2\x80\x99s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in\r\nme I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t pray a lie\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nfound that out.\r\n\r\nSo I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to\r\ndo. At last I had an idea; and I says, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and write the\r\nletter\xe2\x80\x94and _then_ see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I\r\nfelt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all\r\ngone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited,\r\nand set down and wrote:\r\n\r\nMiss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\r\nPikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\r\nreward if you send. HUCK FINN.\r\n\r\nI felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever\r\nfelt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it\r\nstraight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking\xe2\x80\x94thinking\r\nhow good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being\r\nlost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over\r\nour trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the\r\nday and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and\r\nwe a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only\r\nthe other kind. I\xe2\x80\x99d see him standing my watch on top of his\xe2\x80\x99n, \xe2\x80\x99stead\r\nof calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was\r\nwhen I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the\r\nswamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would\r\nalways call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of\r\nfor me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I\r\nsaved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard, and he was so\r\ngrateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the\r\nworld, and the _only_ one he\xe2\x80\x99s got now; and then I happened to look\r\naround and see that paper.\r\n\r\nIt was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was\r\na-trembling, because I\xe2\x80\x99d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things,\r\nand I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and\r\nthen says to myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll _go_ to hell\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and tore it up.\r\n\r\nIt was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let\r\nthem stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the\r\nwhole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\r\nwhich was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn\xe2\x80\x99t. And\r\nfor a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\r\nand if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because\r\nas long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\r\n\r\nThen I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\r\nconsiderable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\r\nsuited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\r\nthe river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with\r\nmy raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept\r\nthe night through, and got up before it was light, and had my\r\nbreakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and\r\none thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for\r\nshore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps\xe2\x80\x99s place, and hid my\r\nbundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and\r\nloaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I\r\nwanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam-sawmill\r\nthat was on the bank.\r\n\r\nThen I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x9cPhelps\xe2\x80\x99s Sawmill,\xe2\x80\x9d and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\r\nthree hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\r\nbecause I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see nobody just yet\xe2\x80\x94I only wanted to get the\r\nlay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there\r\nfrom the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved\r\nalong, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got\r\nthere was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal\r\nNonesuch\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94three-night performance\xe2\x80\x94like that other time. _They_ had the\r\ncheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked\r\nastonished, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHel-_lo!_ Where\xe2\x80\x99d _you_ come from?\xe2\x80\x9d Then he says, kind of glad and\r\neager, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the raft?\xe2\x80\x94got her in a good place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I was going to ask your grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look so joyful, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was your idea for asking _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\r\nto myself, we can\xe2\x80\x99t get him home for hours, till he\xe2\x80\x99s soberer; so I\r\nwent a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and\r\noffered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back\r\nto fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to\r\nthe boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him\r\nto shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run,\r\nand we after him. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no dog, and so we had to chase him\r\nall over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till\r\ndark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When\r\nI got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, \xe2\x80\x99They\xe2\x80\x99ve got into\r\ntrouble and had to leave; and they\xe2\x80\x99ve took my nigger, which is the\r\nonly nigger I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the world, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m in a strange country,\r\nand ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my\r\nliving\xe2\x80\x99; so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But\r\nwhat _did_ become of the raft, then?\xe2\x80\x94and Jim\xe2\x80\x94poor Jim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlamed if _I_ know\xe2\x80\x94that is, what\xe2\x80\x99s become of the raft. That old fool\r\nhad made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the\r\ndoggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every\r\ncent but what he\xe2\x80\x99d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last\r\nnight and found the raft gone, we said, \xe2\x80\x98That little rascal has stole\r\nour raft and shook us, and run off down the river.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shake my _nigger_, would I?\xe2\x80\x94the only nigger I had in the\r\nworld, and the only property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we\xe2\x80\x99d come to consider him\r\n_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so\xe2\x80\x94goodness knows we had\r\ntrouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat\r\nbroke, there warn\xe2\x80\x99t anything for it but to try the \xe2\x80\x98Royal Nonesuch\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanother shake. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s that ten cents? Give it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\r\nspend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all\r\nthe money I had, and I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had nothing to eat since yesterday. He\r\nnever said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We\xe2\x80\x99d skin him if he done\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can he blow? Hain\xe2\x80\x99t he run off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sold_ him?\xe2\x80\x9d I says, and begun to cry; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, he was _my_ nigger, and\r\nthat was my money. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x94I want my nigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t _get_ your nigger, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94so dry up your\r\nblubbering. Looky here\xe2\x80\x94do you think _you\xe2\x80\x99d_ venture to blow on us?\r\nBlamed if I think I\xe2\x80\x99d trust you. Why, if you _was_ to blow on us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\r\nbefore. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to blow on nobody; and I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no time to blow,\r\nnohow; I got to turn out and find my nigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering\r\non his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npromise you won\xe2\x80\x99t blow, and won\xe2\x80\x99t let the nigger blow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nwhere to find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I promised, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA farmer by the name of Silas Ph\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and then he stopped. You see, he\r\nstarted to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun\r\nto study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so\r\nhe was. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out\r\nof the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man that bought him is named Abram Foster\xe2\x80\x94Abram G. Foster\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhe lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to\r\nLafayette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI can walk it in three days. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll start this\r\nvery afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo you won\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99ll start _now_; and don\xe2\x80\x99t you lose any time about\r\nit, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue\r\nin your head and move right along, and then you won\xe2\x80\x99t get into trouble\r\nwith _us_, d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I\r\nwanted to be left free to work my plans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo clear out,\xe2\x80\x9d he says; \xe2\x80\x9cand you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you\r\nwant to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your\r\nnigger\xe2\x80\x94some idiots don\xe2\x80\x99t require documents\xe2\x80\x94leastways I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s such down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and\r\nthe reward\xe2\x80\x99s bogus, maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll believe you when you explain to him\r\nwhat the idea was for getting \xe2\x80\x99em out. Go \xe2\x80\x99long now, and tell him\r\nanything you want to; but mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t work your jaw any _between_\r\nhere and there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I left, and struck for the back country. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look around, but\r\nI kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him\r\nout at that. I went straight out in the country as much as a mile\r\nbefore I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards\r\nPhelps\xe2\x80\x99s. I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without\r\nfooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim\xe2\x80\x99s mouth till these\r\nfellows could get away. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want no trouble with their kind. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nseen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and\r\nsunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of\r\nfaint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so\r\nlonesome and like everybody\xe2\x80\x99s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans\r\nalong and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you\r\nfeel like it\xe2\x80\x99s spirits whispering\xe2\x80\x94spirits that\xe2\x80\x99s been dead ever so\r\nmany years\xe2\x80\x94and you always think they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about _you._ As a\r\ngeneral thing it makes a body wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with\r\nit all.\r\n\r\nPhelps\xe2\x80\x99s was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and\r\nthey all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made\r\nout of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a\r\ndifferent length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to\r\nstand on when they are going to jump onto a horse; some sickly\r\ngrass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like\r\nan old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log house for the white\r\nfolks\xe2\x80\x94hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and\r\nthese mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log\r\nkitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the\r\nhouse; log smokehouse back of the kitchen; three little nigger cabins\r\nin a row t\xe2\x80\x99other side the smokehouse; one little hut all by itself\r\naway down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece\r\nthe other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the\r\nlittle hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a\r\ngourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about;\r\nabout three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and\r\ngooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a\r\ngarden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton-fields begins, and\r\nafter the fields the woods.\r\n\r\nI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and\r\nstarted for the kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum\r\nof a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and\r\nthen I knowed for certain I wished I was dead\xe2\x80\x94for that _is_ the\r\nlonesomest sound in the whole world.\r\n\r\nI went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just\r\ntrusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the\r\ntime come; for I\xe2\x80\x99d noticed that Providence always did put the right\r\nwords in my mouth if I left it alone.\r\n\r\nWhen I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went\r\nfor me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And\r\nsuch another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a\r\nkind of a hub of a wheel, as you may say\xe2\x80\x94spokes made out of\r\ndogs\xe2\x80\x94circle of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their\r\nnecks and noses stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and\r\nmore a-coming; you could see them sailing over fences and around\r\ncorners from everywheres.\r\n\r\nA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in\r\nher hand, singing out, \xe2\x80\x9cBegone! _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them\r\nhowling, and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them\r\ncome back, wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.\r\nThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no harm in a hound, nohow.\r\n\r\nAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger\r\nboys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to\r\ntheir mother\xe2\x80\x99s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful,\r\nthe way they always do. And here comes the white woman running from\r\nthe house, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her\r\nspinning-stick in her hand; and behind her comes her little white\r\nchildren, acting the same way the little niggers was going. She was\r\nsmiling all over so she could hardly stand\xe2\x80\x94and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _you_, at last!\xe2\x80\x94_ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI out with a \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x9d before I thought.\r\n\r\nShe grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands\r\nand shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down\r\nover; and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but\r\nlaw sakes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that, I\xe2\x80\x99m _so_ glad to see you! Dear, dear,\r\nit does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it\xe2\x80\x99s your cousin\r\nTom!\xe2\x80\x94tell him howdy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths,\r\nand hid behind her. So she run on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away\xe2\x80\x94or did you get\r\nyour breakfast on the boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house,\r\nleading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got\r\nthere she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down\r\non a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hungry\r\nfor it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it\xe2\x80\x99s come\r\nat last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more. What kep\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x94boat get aground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say yes\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94say Aunt Sally. Where\xe2\x80\x99d she get aground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know what to say, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the\r\nboat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on\r\ninstinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up\xe2\x80\x94from down\r\ntowards Orleans. That didn\xe2\x80\x99t help me much, though; for I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthe names of bars down that way. I see I\xe2\x80\x99d got to invent a bar, or\r\nforget the name of the one we got aground on\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94Now I struck an\r\nidea, and fetched it out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt warn\xe2\x80\x99t the grounding\xe2\x80\x94that didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep us back but a little. We\r\nblowed out a cylinder-head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious! anybody hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x99m. Killed a nigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago\r\nlast Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the\r\nold Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.\r\nAnd I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas\r\nknowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes,\r\nI remember now, he _did_ die. Mortification set in, and they had to\r\namputate him. But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t save him. Yes, it was mortification\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwas it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious\r\nresurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s been up\r\nto the town every day to fetch you. And he\xe2\x80\x99s gone again, not more\xe2\x80\x99n an\r\nhour ago; he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back any minute now. You must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 met him on the\r\nroad, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x94oldish man, with a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at\r\ndaylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking\r\naround the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and\r\nnot get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99d you give the baggage to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, child, it \xe2\x80\x99ll be stole!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot where _I_ hid it I reckon it won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain see me standing around, and told me I better have\r\nsomething to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to\r\nthe officers\xe2\x80\x99 lunch, and give me all I wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was getting so uneasy I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen good. I had my mind on the\r\nchildren all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump\r\nthem a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get no show,\r\nMrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold\r\nchills streak all down my back, because she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut here we\xe2\x80\x99re a-running on this way, and you hain\xe2\x80\x99t told me a word\r\nabout Sis, nor any of them. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll rest my works a little, and you\r\nstart up yourn; just tell me _everything_\xe2\x80\x94tell me all about \xe2\x80\x99m\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94every one of \xe2\x80\x99m; and how they are, and what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, and\r\nwhat they told you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, I see I was up a stump\xe2\x80\x94and up it good. Providence had stood by\r\nme this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now. I see it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit of use to try to go ahead\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d _got_ to throw up my hand.\r\nSo I says to myself, here\xe2\x80\x99s another place where I got to resk the\r\ntruth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me\r\nin behind the bed, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he comes! Stick your head down lower\xe2\x80\x94there, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do; you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be seen now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you let on you\xe2\x80\x99re here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll play a joke on\r\nhim. Children, don\xe2\x80\x99t you say a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI see I was in a fix now. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use to worry; there\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to\r\nstand from under when the lightning struck.\r\n\r\nI had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in;\r\nthen the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-_ness_ gracious!\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat in the world _can_ have become\r\nof him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cand I must say it makes me\r\ndreadful uneasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUneasy!\xe2\x80\x9d she says; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to go distracted! He _must_ \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 come;\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ve missed him along the road. I _know_ it\xe2\x80\x99s so\xe2\x80\x94something\r\n_tells_ me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Sally, I _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ miss him along the road\xe2\x80\x94_you_ know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say! He must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 come! You must\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 missed him. He\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t distress me any more\xe2\x80\x99n I\xe2\x80\x99m already distressed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat in the world to make of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m at my wit\xe2\x80\x99s end, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nacknowledging \xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99m right down scared. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no hope that he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncome; for he _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ come and me miss him. Sally, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterrible\xe2\x80\x94just terrible\xe2\x80\x94something\xe2\x80\x99s happened to the boat, sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Silas! Look yonder!\xe2\x80\x94up the road!\xe2\x80\x94ain\xe2\x80\x99t that somebody coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give\r\nMrs. Phelps the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot\r\nof the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back\r\nfrom the window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house\r\nafire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old\r\ngentleman stared, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you reckon \xe2\x80\x99tis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t no idea. Who _is_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _Tom Sawyer!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no time\r\nto swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept\r\non shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh\r\nand cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and\r\nMary, and the rest of the tribe.\r\n\r\nBut if they was joyful, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing to what I was; for it was\r\nlike being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they\r\nfroze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmean the Sawyer family\xe2\x80\x94than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.\r\nAnd I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the\r\nmouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it. Which was\r\nall right, and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t know but what\r\nit would take three days to fix it. If I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 called it a bolthead it\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done just as well.\r\n\r\nNow I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty\r\nuncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and\r\ncomfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear\r\na steamboat coughing along down the river. Then I says to myself,\r\ns\xe2\x80\x99pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat? And s\xe2\x80\x99pose he steps in\r\nhere any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink\r\nto keep quiet?\r\n\r\nWell, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t _have_ it that way; it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do at all. I must go\r\nup the road and waylay him. So I told the folks I reckoned I would go\r\nup to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old gentleman was for\r\ngoing along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself,\r\nand I druther he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take no trouble about me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a\r\nwagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and\r\nwaited till he come along. I says \xe2\x80\x9cHold on!\xe2\x80\x9d and it stopped alongside,\r\nand his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed\r\ntwo or three times like a person that\xe2\x80\x99s got a dry throat, and then\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever done you no harm. You know that. So, then, what you\r\nwant to come back and ha\xe2\x80\x99nt _me_ for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t come back\xe2\x80\x94I hain\xe2\x80\x99t been _gone_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nsatisfied yet. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t on you. Honest\r\ninjun, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t a ghost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonest injun, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsomehow seem to understand it no way. Looky here, warn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever\r\nmurdered _at all?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever murdered at all\xe2\x80\x94I played it on them. You come in\r\nhere and feel of me if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me\r\nagain he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it\r\nright off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it\r\nhit him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and\r\ntold his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told\r\nhim the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?\r\nHe said, let him alone a minute, and don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb him. So he thought\r\nand thought, and pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s your\xe2\x80\x99n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to\r\nthe house about the time you ought to; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go towards town a\r\npiece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an\r\nhour after you; and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t let on to know me at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; but wait a minute. There\xe2\x80\x99s one more thing\xe2\x80\x94a thing that\r\n_nobody_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know but me. And that is, there\xe2\x80\x99s a nigger here that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_\xe2\x80\x94old Miss\r\nWatson\xe2\x80\x99s Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Why, Jim is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped and went to studying. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ know what you\xe2\x80\x99ll say. You\xe2\x80\x99ll say it\xe2\x80\x99s dirty, low-down business;\r\nbut what if it is? _I_\xe2\x80\x99m low down; and I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to steal him, and I\r\nwant you keep mum and not let on. Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eye lit up, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll _help_ you steal him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most\r\nastonishing speech I ever heard\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell\r\nconsiderable in my estimation. Only I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Tom Sawyer\r\na _nigger-stealer!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shucks!\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t joking, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cjoking or no joking, if you hear anything said\r\nabout a runaway nigger, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to remember that _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nnothing about him, and _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his\r\nway and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on\r\naccounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too\r\nquick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door,\r\nand he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is wonderful! Whoever would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 thought it was in that mare\r\nto do it? I wish we\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 timed her. And she hain\xe2\x80\x99t sweated a\r\nhair\xe2\x80\x94not a hair. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. Why, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take a hundred\r\ndollars for that horse now\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, honest; and yet I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 sold\r\nher for fifteen before, and thought \xe2\x80\x99twas all she was worth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.\r\nBut it warn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising; because he warn\xe2\x80\x99t only just a farmer, he was\r\na preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of\r\nthe plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a\r\nchurch and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching,\r\nand it was worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like\r\nthat, and done the same way, down South.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wagon drove up to the front stile, and\r\nAunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about\r\nfifty yards, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody come! I wonder who \xe2\x80\x99tis? Why, I do believe it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na stranger. Jimmy\xe2\x80\x9d (that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the children), \xe2\x80\x9crun and tell Lize to\r\nput on another plate for dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a\r\nstranger don\xe2\x80\x99t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the\r\nyaller-fever, for interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile\r\nand starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the\r\nvillage, and we was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store\r\nclothes on, and an audience\xe2\x80\x94and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.\r\nIn them circumstances it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no trouble to him to throw in an\r\namount of style that was suitable. He warn\xe2\x80\x99t a boy to meeky along up\r\nthat yard like a sheep; no, he come ca\xe2\x80\x99m and important, like the ram.\r\nWhen he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and\r\ndainty, like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it\r\nand he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to disturb them, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say \xe2\x80\x99t your driver\r\nhas deceived you; Nichols\xe2\x80\x99s place is down a matter of three mile more.\r\nCome in, come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, \xe2\x80\x9cToo late\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nout of sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with\r\nus; and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwalk\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we won\xe2\x80\x99t _let_ you walk\xe2\x80\x94it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be Southern hospitality to\r\ndo it. Come right in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _do_,\xe2\x80\x9d says Aunt Sally; \xe2\x80\x9cit ain\xe2\x80\x99t a bit of trouble to us, not a\r\nbit in the world. You must stay. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long, dusty three mile, and we\r\n_can\xe2\x80\x99t_ let you walk. And, besides, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already told \xe2\x80\x99em to put on\r\nanother plate when I see you coming; so you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint us.\r\nCome right in and make yourself at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be\r\npersuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger\r\nfrom Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson\xe2\x80\x94and he made\r\nanother bow.\r\n\r\nWell, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and\r\neverybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and\r\nwondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,\r\nstill talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on\r\nthe mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and\r\nwas going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back\r\nof her hand, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou owdacious puppy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked kind of hurt, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at you, m\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re s\xe2\x80\x99rp\xe2\x80\x94Why, what do you reckon _I_ am? I\xe2\x80\x99ve a good notion to\r\ntake and\xe2\x80\x94Say, what do you mean by kissing me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked kind of humble, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean nothing, m\xe2\x80\x99am. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm. I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94thought\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you born fool!\xe2\x80\x9d She took up the spinning-stick, and it looked\r\nlike it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you think I\xe2\x80\x99d like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Only, they\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x94told me you would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_They_ told you I would. Whoever told you\xe2\x80\x99s _another_ lunatic. I\r\nnever heard the beat of it. Who\xe2\x80\x99s _they?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, everybody. They all said so, m\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her\r\nfingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99everybody\xe2\x80\x99? Out with their names, or ther\xe2\x80\x99ll be an idiot\r\nshort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, and I warn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting it. They told me to. They all told\r\nme to. They all said, kiss her; and said she\xe2\x80\x99d like it. They all said\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94every one of them. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, m\xe2\x80\x99am, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it no\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t, honest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Well, I sh\xe2\x80\x99d _reckon_ you won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x99m, I\xe2\x80\x99m honest about it; I won\xe2\x80\x99t ever do it again\xe2\x80\x94till you ask\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill I _ask_ you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days! I\r\nlay you\xe2\x80\x99ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever _I_ ask\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94or the likes of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cit does surprise me so. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out,\r\nsomehow. They said you would, and I thought you would. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nstopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a\r\nfriendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ think she\xe2\x80\x99d like me to kiss her, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no; I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94well, no, I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he looks on around the same way to me, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, didn\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ think Aunt Sally \xe2\x80\x99d open out her arms and say, \xe2\x80\x99Sid\r\nSawyer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy land!\xe2\x80\x9d she says, breaking in and jumping for him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou impudent\r\nyoung rascal, to fool a body so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and was going to hug him, but he\r\nfended her off, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not till you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked me first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed\r\nhim over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and\r\nhe took what was left. And after they got a little quiet again she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for\r\n_you_ at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming\r\nbut him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because it warn\xe2\x80\x99t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsays; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me\r\ncome, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a\r\nfirst-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for\r\nme to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.\r\nBut it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain\xe2\x80\x99t no healthy place for a\r\nstranger to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I\r\nhain\xe2\x80\x99t been so put out since I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind the terms\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to\r\nhave you here. Well, to think of that performance! I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, I\r\nwas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the\r\nkitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven\r\nfamilies\xe2\x80\x94and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk\r\nof old cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty\r\nlong blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t cool it a\r\nbit, neither, the way I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\r\nand Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use, they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was\r\nafraid to try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, one of the\r\nlittle boys says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPa, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon there ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to be any; and you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and\r\nme all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the\r\npeople; so I reckon they\xe2\x80\x99ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town\r\nbefore this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo there it was!\xe2\x80\x94but _I_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Tom and me was to sleep in\r\nthe same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good night and went up\r\nto bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the\r\nlightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe anybody\r\nwas going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhurry up and give them one they\xe2\x80\x99d get into trouble sure.\r\n\r\nOn the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was\r\nmurdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back no\r\nmore, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all\r\nabout our \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal Nonesuch\xe2\x80\x9d rapscallions, and as much of the raft\r\nvoyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through\r\nthe middle of it\xe2\x80\x94it was as much as half after eight then\xe2\x80\x94here comes\r\na raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and\r\nyelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one\r\nside to let them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king\r\nand the duke astraddle of a rail\xe2\x80\x94that is, I knowed it _was_ the king\r\nand the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook like nothing in the world that was human\xe2\x80\x94just looked like a\r\ncouple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see\r\nit; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world. It\r\nwas a dreadful thing to see. Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWe see we was too late\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good. We asked some stragglers\r\nabout it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very\r\ninnocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the\r\nmiddle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal,\r\nand the house rose up and went for them.\r\n\r\nSo we poked along back home, and I warn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling so brash as I was\r\nbefore, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow\xe2\x80\x94though\r\n_I_ hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done nothing. But that\xe2\x80\x99s always the way; it don\xe2\x80\x99t make no\r\ndifference whether you do right or wrong, a person\xe2\x80\x99s conscience ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot no sense, and just goes for him _anyway._ If I had a yaller dog\r\nthat didn\xe2\x80\x99t know no more than a person\xe2\x80\x99s conscience does I would pison\r\nhim. It takes up more room than all the rest of a person\xe2\x80\x99s insides,\r\nand yet ain\xe2\x80\x99t no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I bet\r\nI know where Jim is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at\r\ndinner, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think the vittles was for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo \xe2\x80\x99d I. Well, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause part of it was watermelon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was\xe2\x80\x94I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought\r\nabout a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked\r\nit again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we\r\ngot up from table\xe2\x80\x94same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows\r\nprisoner; and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t likely there\xe2\x80\x99s two prisoners on such a little\r\nplantation, and where the people\xe2\x80\x99s all so kind and good. Jim\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nprisoner. All right\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we found it out detective fashion; I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind, and\r\nstudy out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll take the one we like the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s head I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown\r\nin a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a\r\nplan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where\r\nthe right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right\xe2\x80\x94bring it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy plan is this,\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can easy find out if it\xe2\x80\x99s Jim in there.\r\nThen get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the\r\nisland. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the\r\nold man\xe2\x80\x99s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river\r\non the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me\r\nand Jim used to do before. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that plan work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Work?_ Why, cert\xe2\x80\x99nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo blame\xe2\x80\x99 simple; there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing _to_ it. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of a\r\nplan that ain\xe2\x80\x99t no more trouble than that? It\xe2\x80\x99s as mild as goose-milk.\r\nWhy, Huck, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make no more talk than breaking into a soap\r\nfactory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never said nothing, because I warn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting nothing different;\r\nbut I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have none of them objections to it.\r\n\r\nAnd it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was\r\nworth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man\r\nas mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was\r\nsatisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell what it\r\nwas here, because I knowed it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay the way it was. I knowed\r\nhe would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and\r\nheaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what\r\nhe done.\r\n\r\nWell, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in\r\nearnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of\r\nslavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy\r\nthat was respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose;\r\nand folks at home that had characters; and he was bright and not\r\nleather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind;\r\nand yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling,\r\nthan to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his\r\nfamily a shame, before everybody. I _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ understand it no way at\r\nall. It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him\r\nso; and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where\r\nhe was and save himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me\r\nup, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m about? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I generly know what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Well_, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all he said, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I said. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use to say any\r\nmore; because when he said he\xe2\x80\x99d do a thing, he always done it. But _I_\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just\r\nlet it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to\r\nhave it so, _I_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down\r\nto the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the\r\nyard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything\r\ncomes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the\r\nfront and the two sides; and on the side I warn\xe2\x80\x99t acquainted\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94which was the north side\xe2\x80\x94we found a square window-hole, up\r\ntolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the ticket. This hole\xe2\x80\x99s big enough for Jim to get through if\r\nwe wrench off the board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing\r\nhooky. I should _hope_ we can find a way that\xe2\x80\x99s a little more\r\ncomplicated than _that_, Huck Finn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x99ll it do to saw him out, the way I done\r\nbefore I was murdered that time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s more _like_,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s real mysterious, and troublesome,\r\nand good,\xe2\x80\x9d he says; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I bet we can find a way that\xe2\x80\x99s twice as long.\r\nThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no hurry; le\xe2\x80\x99s keep on looking around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\r\njoined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long\r\nas the hut, but narrow\xe2\x80\x94only about six foot wide. The door to it was\r\nat the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle\r\nand searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid\r\nwith; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell\r\ndown, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a\r\nmatch, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nconnection with it; and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no floor to the shed, nor nothing\r\nin it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a\r\ncrippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the\r\nstaple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re all right. We\xe2\x80\x99ll _dig_ him out. It \xe2\x80\x99ll take about a week!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen we started for the house, and I went in the back door\xe2\x80\x94you only\r\nhave to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don\xe2\x80\x99t fasten the doors\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthat warn\xe2\x80\x99t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but\r\nhe must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half-way about\r\nthree times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time\r\nmost busted his brains out, he thought he\xe2\x80\x99d got to give it up; but\r\nafter he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for\r\nluck, and this time he made the trip.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger\r\ncabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x94if it _was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting\r\nthrough breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim\xe2\x80\x99s nigger was\r\npiling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the\r\nothers was leaving, the key come from the house.\r\n\r\nThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\r\nall tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches\r\noff. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\r\nmaking him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\r\nstrange words and noises, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe he was ever witched so\r\nlong before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so\r\nabout his troubles, he forgot all about what he\xe2\x80\x99d been a-going to do.\r\nSo Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face, like when you\r\nheave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mars Sid, _a_ dog. Cur\xe2\x80\x99us dog, too. Does you want to go en look\r\nat \xe2\x80\x99im?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hunched Tom, and whispers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou going, right here in the daybreak? _That_ warn\xe2\x80\x99t the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t; but it\xe2\x80\x99s the plan _now._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it much. When we got in\r\nwe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there,\r\nsure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _Huck!_ En good _lan\xe2\x80\x99!_ ain\xe2\x80\x99 dat Misto Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. _I_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nnothing to do; and if I had I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it, because that\r\nnigger busted in and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and\r\nkind of wondering, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes _who_ know us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, dis-yer runaway nigger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _put_ it dar? Didn\xe2\x80\x99 he jis\xe2\x80\x99 dis minute sing out like he knowed\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s mighty curious. _Who_ sung out? _When_ did he sing out?\r\n_What_ did he sing out?\xe2\x80\x9d And turns to me, perfectly ca\xe2\x80\x99m, and says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid _you_ hear anybody sing out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; _I_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t heard nobody say nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you sing out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sah,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jim; \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ hain\xe2\x80\x99t said nothing, sah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sah, I hain\xe2\x80\x99t said a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see us before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sah; not as _I_ knows on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and\r\nsays, kind of severe:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you reckon\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think\r\nsomebody sung out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s de dad-blame\xe2\x80\x99 witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.\r\nDey\xe2\x80\x99s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos\xe2\x80\x99 kill me, dey sk\xe2\x80\x99yers me so.\r\nPlease to don\xe2\x80\x99t tell nobody \xe2\x80\x99bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nscole me; \xe2\x80\x99kase he say dey _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ no witches. I jis\xe2\x80\x99 wish to goodness\r\nhe was heah now\xe2\x80\x94_den_ what would he say! I jis\xe2\x80\x99 bet he couldn\xe2\x80\x99 fine\r\nno way to git aroun\xe2\x80\x99 it _dis_ time. But it\xe2\x80\x99s awluz jis\xe2\x80\x99 so; people\r\ndat\xe2\x80\x99s _sot_, stays sot; dey won\xe2\x80\x99t look into noth\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 en fine it out f\xe2\x80\x99r\r\ndeyselves, en when _you_ fine it out en tell um \xe2\x80\x99bout it, dey doan\xe2\x80\x99\r\nb\xe2\x80\x99lieve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell nobody; and told him to\r\nbuy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to\r\ncatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, _I_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nhim up, I\xe2\x80\x99d hang him.\xe2\x80\x9d And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to\r\nlook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on\r\nnights, it\xe2\x80\x99s us; we\xe2\x80\x99re going to set you free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the\r\nnigger come back, and we said we\xe2\x80\x99d come again some time if the nigger\r\nwanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark,\r\nbecause the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good\r\nto have folks around then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck\r\ndown into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to\r\nsee how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into\r\ntrouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncalled fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay\r\nthem in a dark place. We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds,\r\nand set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.\r\nAnd so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.\r\nThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no watchman to be drugged\xe2\x80\x94now there _ought_ to be a\r\nwatchman. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of\r\nhis bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip\r\noff the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to\r\nthe punkin-headed nigger, and don\xe2\x80\x99t send nobody to watch the nigger.\r\nJim could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got out of that window-hole before this, only there\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.\r\nWhy, drat it, Huck, it\xe2\x80\x99s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got\r\nto invent _all_ the difficulties. Well, we can\xe2\x80\x99t help it; we got to do\r\nthe best we can with the materials we\xe2\x80\x99ve got. Anyhow, there\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s more honor in getting him out through a lot of\r\ndifficulties and dangers, where there warn\xe2\x80\x99t one of them furnished to\r\nyou by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had\r\nto contrive them all out of your own head. Now look at just that one\r\nthing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply\r\ngot to _let on_ that a lantern\xe2\x80\x99s resky. Why, we could work with a\r\ntorchlight procession if we wanted to, _I_ believe. Now, whilst I\r\nthink of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the\r\nfirst chance we get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we want of a saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we _want_ of a saw? Hain\xe2\x80\x99t we got to saw the leg of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s bed\r\noff, so as to get the chain loose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the\r\nchain off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that ain\xe2\x80\x99t just like you, Huck Finn. You _can_ get up the\r\ninfant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain\xe2\x80\x99t you ever read\r\nany books at all?\xe2\x80\x94Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto\r\nChelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who ever heard of\r\ngetting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the\r\nway all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and\r\nleave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can\xe2\x80\x99t be found, and\r\nput some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest\r\nseneskal can\xe2\x80\x99t see no sign of its being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg\r\nis perfectly sound. Then, the night you\xe2\x80\x99re ready, fetch the leg a\r\nkick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing\r\nto do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it,\r\nbreak your leg in the moat\xe2\x80\x94because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too\r\nshort, you know\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s your horses and your trusty vassles, and\r\nthey scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to\r\nyour native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s gaudy, Huck.\r\nI wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get time, the night of\r\nthe escape, we\xe2\x80\x99ll dig one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we want of a moat when we\xe2\x80\x99re going to snake him out from\r\nunder the cabin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had\r\nhis chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his\r\nhead; then sighs again, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\xe2\x80\x94there ain\xe2\x80\x99t necessity enough for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what?\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to saw Jim\xe2\x80\x99s leg off,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood land!\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t _no_ necessity for it. And what\r\nwould you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the\r\nchain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg would\r\nbe better still. But we got to let that go. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t necessity\r\nenough in this case; and, besides, Jim\xe2\x80\x99s a nigger, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand the reasons for it, and how it\xe2\x80\x99s the custom in Europe; so\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll let it go. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing\xe2\x80\x94he can have a rope ladder; we\r\ncan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And we\r\ncan send it to him in a pie; it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly done that way. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve et\r\nworse pies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cJim ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no use for a\r\nrope ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _has_ got use for it. How _you_ talk, you better say; you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow nothing about it. He\xe2\x80\x99s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the nation can he _do_ with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ with it? He can hide it in his bed, can\xe2\x80\x99t he? That\xe2\x80\x99s what they\r\nall do; and _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ got to, too. Huck, you don\xe2\x80\x99t ever seem to want to\r\ndo anything that\xe2\x80\x99s regular; you want to be starting something fresh\r\nall the time. S\xe2\x80\x99pose he _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ do nothing with it? ain\xe2\x80\x99t it there in\r\nhis bed, for a clue, after he\xe2\x80\x99s gone? and don\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwant clues? Of course they will. And you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave them any? That\r\nwould be a _pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ it! I never heard of such a\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cif it\xe2\x80\x99s in the regulations, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got to have it,\r\nall right, let him have it; because I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to go back on no\r\nregulations; but there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x94if we go to tearing up\r\nour sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get into trouble\r\nwith Aunt Sally, just as sure as you\xe2\x80\x99re born. Now, the way I look at\r\nit, a hickry-bark ladder don\xe2\x80\x99t cost nothing, and don\xe2\x80\x99t waste nothing,\r\nand is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,\r\nas any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t had no\r\nexperience, and so _he_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care what kind of a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I\xe2\x80\x99d keep\r\nstill\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what _I\xe2\x80\x99d_ do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping\r\nby a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you\xe2\x80\x99ll take my\r\nadvice, you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothes-line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorrow a shirt, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we want of a shirt, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant it for Jim to keep a journal on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJournal your granny\xe2\x80\x94_Jim_ can\xe2\x80\x99t write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99pose he _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ write\xe2\x80\x94he can make marks on the shirt, can\xe2\x80\x99t he, if\r\nwe make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron\r\nbarrel-hoop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better\r\none; and quicker, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Prisoners_ don\xe2\x80\x99t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull\r\npens out of, you muggins. They _always_ make their pens out of the\r\nhardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or\r\nsomething like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them\r\nweeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall. _They_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use a\r\ngoose-quill if they had it. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t regular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what \xe2\x80\x99ll we make him the ink out of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that\xe2\x80\x99s the common sort\r\nand women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that;\r\nand when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious\r\nmessage to let the world know where he\xe2\x80\x99s captivated, he can write it\r\non the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the\r\nwindow. The Iron Mask always done that, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a blame\xe2\x80\x99 good way,\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing; we can get him some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t nobody _read_ his plates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn. All _he\xe2\x80\x99s_ got to\r\ndo is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don\xe2\x80\x99t _have_ to be\r\nable to read it. Why, half the time you can\xe2\x80\x99t read anything a prisoner\r\nwrites on a tin plate, or anywhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what\xe2\x80\x99s the sense in wasting the plates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, blame it all, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t the _prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s_ plates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s _somebody\xe2\x80\x99s_ plates, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, spos\xe2\x80\x99n it is? What does the _prisoner_ care whose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we\r\ncleared out for the house.\r\n\r\nAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of\r\nthe clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we\r\nwent down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it\r\nborrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing\r\nprisoners; and prisoners don\xe2\x80\x99t care how they get a thing so they get\r\nit, and nobody don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them for it, either. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t no crime in a\r\nprisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhis right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a\r\nperfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for\r\nto get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn\xe2\x80\x99t prisoners it\r\nwould be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person\r\nwould steal when he warn\xe2\x80\x99t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal\r\neverything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss,\r\none day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger patch\r\nand eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without\r\ntelling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we\r\ncould steal anything we _needed._ Well, I says, I needed the\r\nwatermelon. But he said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need it to get out of prison with;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s where the difference was. He said if I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 wanted it to hide\r\na knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no\r\nadvantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw\r\nover a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a\r\nchance to hog a watermelon.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was\r\nsettled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then\r\nTom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to\r\nkeep watch. By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the\r\nwoodpile to talk. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s all right now except tools; and that\xe2\x80\x99s easy fixed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTools?\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTools for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to dig with. We ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig\r\na nigger out with?\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\nHe turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,\r\nand all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out\r\nwith? Now I want to ask you\xe2\x80\x94if you got any reasonableness in you at\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94what kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero? Why, they\r\nmight as well lend him the key and done with it. Picks and shovels\xe2\x80\x94why,\r\nthey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t furnish \xe2\x80\x99em to a king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cif we don\xe2\x80\x99t want the picks and shovels, what do\r\nwe want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA couple of case-knives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it, it\xe2\x80\x99s foolish, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference how foolish it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s the _right_\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s the regular way. And there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no _other_ way, that\r\never _I_ heard of, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve read all the books that gives any\r\ninformation about these things. They always dig out with a\r\ncase-knife\xe2\x80\x94and not through dirt, mind you; generly it\xe2\x80\x99s through solid\r\nrock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and\r\never. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the\r\nCastle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that\r\nway; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. A month and a half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Thirty-seven year_\xe2\x80\x94and he come out in China. _That\xe2\x80\x99s_ the kind. I\r\nwish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Jim_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know nobody in China.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s _that_ got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you stick to\r\nthe main point?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right\xe2\x80\x94_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and\r\nJim don\xe2\x80\x99t, either, I reckon. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, anyway\xe2\x80\x94Jim\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nold to be dug out with a case-knife. He won\xe2\x80\x99t last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes he will _last_, too. You don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take\r\nthirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long will it take, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we can\xe2\x80\x99t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll hear Jim ain\xe2\x80\x99t from there. Then his next move will be to\r\nadvertise Jim, or something like that. So we can\xe2\x80\x99t resk being as long\r\ndigging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a\r\ncouple of years; but we can\xe2\x80\x99t. Things being so uncertain, what I\r\nrecommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;\r\nand after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it\r\nthirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the\r\nfirst time there\xe2\x80\x99s an alarm. Yes, I reckon that \xe2\x80\x99ll be the best way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, there\xe2\x80\x99s _sense_ in that,\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cLetting on don\xe2\x80\x99t cost\r\nnothing; letting on ain\xe2\x80\x99t no trouble; and if it\xe2\x80\x99s any object, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstrain me none, after I got my hand in. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll mosey along now, and\r\nsmouch a couple of case-knives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmouch three,\xe2\x80\x9d he says; \xe2\x80\x9cwe want one to make a saw out of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,\xe2\x80\x9d I says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the\r\nweather-boarding behind the smokehouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and\r\nsmouch the knives\xe2\x80\x94three of them.\xe2\x80\x9d So I done it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down\r\nthe lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out\r\nour pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of\r\nthe way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.\r\nTom said we was right behind Jim\xe2\x80\x99s bed now, and we\xe2\x80\x99d dig in under it,\r\nand when we got through there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody in the cabin ever know\r\nthere was any hole there, because Jim\xe2\x80\x99s counterpin hung down most to\r\nthe ground, and you\xe2\x80\x99d have to raise it up and look under to see the\r\nhole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and\r\nthen we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see we\xe2\x80\x99d done anything hardly. At last I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis ain\xe2\x80\x99t no thirty-seven-year job; this is a thirty-eight-year job,\r\nTom Sawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped\r\ndigging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was\r\nthinking. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use, Huck, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to work. If we was prisoners\r\nit would, because then we\xe2\x80\x99d have as many years as we wanted, and no\r\nhurry; and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while\r\nthey was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get blistered,\r\nand we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it\r\nright, and the way it ought to be done. But _we_ can\xe2\x80\x99t fool along; we\r\ngot to rush; we ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no time to spare. If we was to put in\r\nanother night this way we\xe2\x80\x99d have to knock off for a week to let our\r\nhands get well\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch a case-knife with them sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what we going to do, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t right, and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t moral, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike it to get out; but there ain\xe2\x80\x99t only just the one way: we got to\r\ndig him out with the picks, and _let on_ it\xe2\x80\x99s case-knives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ you\xe2\x80\x99re _talking!_\xe2\x80\x9d I says; \xe2\x80\x9cyour head gets leveler and leveler\r\nall the time, Tom Sawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cPicks is the thing, moral or no\r\nmoral; and as for me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care shucks for the morality of it,\r\nnohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a\r\nSunday-school book, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t no ways particular how it\xe2\x80\x99s done so it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndone. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or\r\nwhat I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick\xe2\x80\x99s the handiest\r\nthing, that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to dig that nigger or that\r\nwatermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a\r\ndead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s excuse for picks and letting on in a case\r\nlike this; if it warn\xe2\x80\x99t so, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t approve of it, nor I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand by and see the rules broke\xe2\x80\x94because right is right, and wrong is\r\nwrong, and a body ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no business doing wrong when he ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nignorant and knows better. It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out\r\nwith a pick, _without_ any letting on, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know no\r\nbetter; but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for me, because I do know better. Gimme a\r\ncase-knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGimme a _case-knife._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know just what to do\xe2\x80\x94but then I thought. I scratched around\r\namongst the old tools, and got a pickax and give it to him, and he\r\ntook it and went to work, and never said a word.\r\n\r\nHe was always just that particular. Full of principle.\r\n\r\nSo then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\r\nand made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was\r\nas long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show\r\nfor it. When I got up-stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom\r\ndoing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come it,\r\nhis hands was so sore. At last he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done. What you reckon I better do? Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think of no way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I reckon it ain\xe2\x80\x99t regular. Come up the stairs, and\r\nlet on it\xe2\x80\x99s a lightning-rod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he done it.\r\n\r\nNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the\r\nhouse, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles;\r\nand I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole\r\nthree tin plates. Tom says it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough; but I said nobody\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they\xe2\x80\x99d fall\r\nin the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole\xe2\x80\x94then we\r\ncould tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was\r\nsatisfied. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake them in through the hole,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we get it done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever\r\nheard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by\r\nhe said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nneed to decide on any of them yet. Said we\xe2\x80\x99d got to post Jim first.\r\n\r\nThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\r\none of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and\r\nheard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t wake him. Then\r\nwe whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a\r\nhalf the job was done. We crept in under Jim\xe2\x80\x99s bed and into the cabin,\r\nand pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim\r\nawhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him\r\nup gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and\r\ncalled us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for\r\nhaving us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with\r\nright away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he\r\nshowed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all\r\nabout our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time\r\nthere was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would\r\nsee he got away, _sure_. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set\r\nthere and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of\r\nquestions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two\r\nto pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable\r\nand had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ I know how to fix it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll send you some things by them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do nothing of the kind; it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most jackass\r\nideas I ever struck\xe2\x80\x9d; but he never paid no attention to me; went right\r\non. It was his way when he\xe2\x80\x99d got his plans set.\r\n\r\nSo he told Jim how we\xe2\x80\x99d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and\r\nother large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on\r\nthe lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them;\r\nand we would put small things in uncle\xe2\x80\x99s coat pockets and he must\r\nsteal them out; and we would tie things to aunt\xe2\x80\x99s apron-strings or put\r\nthem in her apron pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they\r\nwould be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on\r\nthe shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white\r\nfolks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he\r\nwould do it all just as Tom said.\r\n\r\nJim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\r\nsociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\r\nbed, with hands that looked like they\xe2\x80\x99d been chawed. Tom was in high\r\nspirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\r\nmost intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we\r\nwould keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our\r\nchildren to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better\r\nand better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it\r\ncould be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best\r\ntime on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a\r\nhand in it.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\r\ncandlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\r\nhis pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\r\ncorn-pone that was in Jim\xe2\x80\x99s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\r\nit would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\r\nmashed all his teeth out; and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever anything could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it\r\nwas only just a piece of rock or something like that that\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\ngetting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing\r\nbut what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\r\ncouple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim\xe2\x80\x99s bed; and they kept on\r\npiling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly room\r\nin there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that\r\nlean-to door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered \xe2\x80\x9cWitches\xe2\x80\x9d once, and\r\nkeeled over onto the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like\r\nhe was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmeat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself\r\nand back again and shut the door, and I knowed he\xe2\x80\x99d fixed the other\r\ndoor too. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting\r\nhim, and asking him if he\xe2\x80\x99d been imagining he saw something again. He\r\nraised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Sid, you\xe2\x80\x99ll say I\xe2\x80\x99s a fool, but if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t b\xe2\x80\x99lieve I see most a\r\nmillion dogs, er devils, er some\xe2\x80\x99n, I wisht I may die right heah in\r\ndese tracks.

What makes them come here just at\r\nthis runaway nigger\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast-time? It\xe2\x80\x99s because they\xe2\x80\x99re hungry;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the reason.

So then we went away and went to the\r\nrubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and\r\nrags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such\r\ntruck, and scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped\r\nup the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down\r\ncellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast, and found\r\na couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner\r\nto scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and\r\ndropped one of them in Aunt Sally\xe2\x80\x99s apron pocket which was hanging on\r\na chair, and t\xe2\x80\x99other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s hat, which\r\nwas on the bureau, because we heard the children say their pa and ma\r\nwas going to the runaway nigger\xe2\x80\x99s house this morning, and then went to\r\nbreakfast, and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s coat\r\npocket, and Aunt Sally wasn\xe2\x80\x99t come yet, so we had to wait a little\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nAnd when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly\r\nwait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with\r\none hand and cracking the handiest child\xe2\x80\x99s head with her thimble with\r\nthe other, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve hunted high and I\xe2\x80\x99ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_\r\nbecome of your other shirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard\r\npiece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the\r\nroad with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the\r\nchildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a\r\ncry out of him the size of a war-whoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue\r\naround the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of\r\nthings for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 sold out for half price if there was a bidder. But after that we\r\nwas all right again\xe2\x80\x94it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us\r\nso kind of cold. Uncle Silas he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s most uncommon curious, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. I know perfectly\r\nwell I took it _off_, because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you hain\xe2\x80\x99t got but one _on_. Just _listen_ at the man! I know\r\nyou took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering\r\nmemory, too, because it was on the clo\xe2\x80\x99s-line yesterday\xe2\x80\x94I see it\r\nthere myself. But it\xe2\x80\x99s gone, that\xe2\x80\x99s the long and the short of it, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to change to a red flann\xe2\x80\x99l one till I can get time to\r\nmake a new one. And it \xe2\x80\x99ll be the third I\xe2\x80\x99ve made in two years. It\r\njust keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you\r\ndo manage to _do_ with \xe2\x80\x99m all is more\xe2\x80\x99n I can make out. A body\xe2\x80\x99d think\r\nyou _would_ learn to take some sort of care of \xe2\x80\x99em at your time of\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be\r\naltogether my fault, because, you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see them nor have\r\nnothing to do with them except when they\xe2\x80\x99re on me; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t _your_ fault if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t, Silas; you\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it\r\nif you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain\xe2\x80\x99t all that\xe2\x80\x99s gone, nuther.\r\nTher\xe2\x80\x99s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t all. There was ten, and now\r\nther\xe2\x80\x99s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never\r\ntook the spoon, _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what else is gone, Sally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTher\xe2\x80\x99s six _candles_ gone\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what. The rats could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got the\r\ncandles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don\xe2\x80\x99t walk off with the\r\nwhole place, the way you\xe2\x80\x99re always going to stop their holes and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo it; and if they warn\xe2\x80\x99t fools they\xe2\x80\x99d sleep in your hair,\r\nSilas\xe2\x80\x94_you\xe2\x80\x99d_ never find it out; but you can\xe2\x80\x99t lay the _spoon_ on the\r\nrats, and that I _know_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sally, I\xe2\x80\x99m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been remiss;\r\nbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurry; next year \xe2\x80\x99ll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta\r\n_Phelps!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the\r\nsugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman\r\nsteps onto the passage, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissus, dey\xe2\x80\x99s a sheet gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _sheet_ gone! Well, for the land\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stop up them holes to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _do_ shet up!\xe2\x80\x94s\xe2\x80\x99pose the rats took the _sheet?_ _Where\xe2\x80\x99s_ it\r\ngone, Lize?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClah to goodness I hain\xe2\x80\x99t no notion, Miss\xe2\x80\x99 Sally. She wuz on de\r\nclo\xe2\x80\x99s-line yistiddy, but she done gone: she ain\xe2\x80\x99 dah no mo\xe2\x80\x99 now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon the world _is_ coming to an end. I _never_ see the beat of\r\nit in all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissus,\xe2\x80\x9d comes a young yaller wench, \xe2\x80\x9cdey\xe2\x80\x99s a brass cannelstick\r\nmiss\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCler out from here, you hussy, er I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a skillet to ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned I\r\nwould sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She\r\nkept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself,\r\nand everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas,\r\nlooking kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. She\r\nstopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished\r\nI was in Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _just_ as I expected. So you had it in your pocket all the time;\r\nand like as not you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the other things there, too. How\xe2\x80\x99d it get\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reely don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Sally,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, kind of apologizing, \xe2\x80\x9cor you\r\nknow I would tell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen\r\nbefore breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing,\r\nmeaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so, because my\r\nTestament ain\xe2\x80\x99t in; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see; and if the Testament is where\r\nI had it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t put it in, and that will show that I laid\r\nthe Testament down and took up the spoon, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for the land\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Give a body a rest! Go \xe2\x80\x99long now, the whole\r\nkit and biling of ye; and don\xe2\x80\x99t come nigh me again till I\xe2\x80\x99ve got back\r\nmy peace of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_I\xe2\x80\x99d_ \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 heard her if she\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 said it to herself, let alone speaking\r\nit out; and I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got up and obeyed her if I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been dead. As we\r\nwas passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat,\r\nand the shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked\r\nit up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and\r\nwent out. Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreliable.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he says: \xe2\x80\x9cBut he done us a good turn with the spoon,\r\nanyway, without knowing it, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ll go and do him one without\r\n_him_ knowing it\xe2\x80\x94stop up his rat-holes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole\r\nhour, but we done the job tight and good and ship-shape. Then we heard\r\nsteps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes\r\nthe old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other, looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went\r\na-mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking\r\ntallow-drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and\r\ndreamy towards the stairs, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for the life of me I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember when I done it. I could\r\nshow her now that I warn\xe2\x80\x99t to blame on account of the rats. But never\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94let it go. I reckon it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on a-mumbling up-stairs, and then we left. He was a\r\nmighty nice old man. And always is.\r\n\r\nTom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out\r\nhe told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the\r\nspoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to\r\ncounting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of\r\nthem up my sleeve, and Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Aunt Sally, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t but nine spoons _yet_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo \xe2\x80\x99long to your play, and don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me. I know better, I counted\r\n\xe2\x80\x99m myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve counted them twice, Aunty, and _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t make but nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked out of all patience, but of course she come to\r\ncount\xe2\x80\x94anybody would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare to gracious ther\xe2\x80\x99 _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ but nine!\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\r\nin the world\xe2\x80\x94plague _take_ the things, I\xe2\x80\x99ll count \xe2\x80\x99m again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang the troublesome rubbage, ther\xe2\x80\x99s _ten_ now!\xe2\x80\x9d and she looked huffy\r\nand bothered both. But Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Aunty, _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou numskull, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see me _count_ \xe2\x80\x99m?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll count \xe2\x80\x99m again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\r\nWell, she _was_ in a tearing way\xe2\x80\x94just a-trembling all over, she was\r\nso mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstart to count in the _basket_ for a spoon sometimes; and so, three\r\ntimes they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then\r\nshe grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked\r\nthe cat galley-west; and she said cler out and let her have some\r\npeace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and\r\ndinner she\xe2\x80\x99d skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her\r\napron pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim\r\ngot it all right, along with her shingle-nail, before noon. We was\r\nvery well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth\r\ntwice the trouble it took, because he said _now_ she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\ncount them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve she\xe2\x80\x99d counted them right if she _did_; and said that after\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d about counted her head off for the next three days he judged\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever\r\ncount them any more.\r\n\r\nSo we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\r\nher closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\r\ncouple of days till she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how many sheets she had any more,\r\nand she didn\xe2\x80\x99t _care_, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\r\nsoul out about it, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t count them again not to save her life;\r\nshe druther die first.\r\n\r\nSo we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\r\nand the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\r\ncounting; and as to the candlestick, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no consequence, it\r\nwould blow over by and by.\r\n\r\nBut that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We\r\nfixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\r\ndone at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and\r\nwe had to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through,\r\nand we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out\r\nwith the smoke; because, you see, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want nothing but a crust,\r\nand we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of\r\ncourse we thought of the right way at last\xe2\x80\x94which was to cook the\r\nladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night,\r\nand tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together,\r\nand long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 hung\r\na person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.\r\n\r\nAnd in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\ninto the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\r\nenough for forty pies if we\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 wanted them, and plenty left over\r\nfor soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 had a whole\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nBut we didn\xe2\x80\x99t need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\r\nso we throwed the rest away. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t cook none of the pies in the\r\nwashpan\xe2\x80\x94afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble\r\nbrass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it\r\nbelonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come\r\nover from England with William the Conqueror in the _Mayflower_ or one\r\nof them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old\r\npots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any\r\naccount, because they warn\xe2\x80\x99t, but on account of them being relicts,\r\nyou know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but\r\nshe failed on the first pies, because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how, but she come\r\nup smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set\r\nher in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough\r\nroof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off\r\nfive foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen\r\nminutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But\r\nthe person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of\r\ntoothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cramp him down to\r\nbusiness I don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, and lay him in\r\nenough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.\r\n\r\nNat didn\xe2\x80\x99t look when we put the witch pie in Jim\xe2\x80\x99s pan; and we put\r\nthe three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and\r\nso Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he\r\nbusted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,\r\nand scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the\r\nwindow-hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and\r\nJim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he\r\nhad to have it; Tom said he\xe2\x80\x99d _got_ to; there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no case of a\r\nstate prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his\r\ncoat of arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Lady Jane Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d he says; \xe2\x80\x9clook at Gilford Dudley; look at\r\nold Northumberland! Why, Huck, s\xe2\x80\x99pose it _is_ considerble\r\ntrouble?\xe2\x80\x94what you going to do?\xe2\x80\x94how you going to get around it? Jim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_got_ to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mars Tom, I hain\xe2\x80\x99t got no coat o\xe2\x80\x99 arm; I hain\xe2\x80\x99t got nuffn but\r\ndish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cJim\xe2\x80\x99s right, anyway, when he says he ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no\r\ncoat of arms, because he hain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon _I_ knowed that,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you bet he\xe2\x80\x99ll have one before\r\nhe goes out of this\xe2\x80\x94because he\xe2\x80\x99s going out _right_, and there ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngoing to be no flaws in his record.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim\r\na-making his\xe2\x80\x99n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,\r\nTom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstruck so many good ones he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly know which to take, but\r\nthere was one which he reckoned he\xe2\x80\x99d decide on. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the scutcheon we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire\r\n_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and\r\nunder his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_\r\nin a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_,\r\nwith the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a\r\nrunaway nigger, _sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar\r\nsinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me;\r\nmotto, _Maggiore fretta, minore atto_. Got it out of a book\xe2\x80\x94means the\r\nmore haste the less speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeewhillikins,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what does the rest of it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no time to bother over that,\xe2\x80\x9d he says; \xe2\x80\x9cwe got to dig in\r\nlike all git-out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s _some_ of it? What\xe2\x80\x99s a fess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fess\xe2\x80\x94a fess is\xe2\x80\x94_you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know what a fess is. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show\r\nhim how to make it when he gets to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you might tell a person. What\xe2\x80\x99s a bar\r\nsinister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But he\xe2\x80\x99s got to have it. All the nobility does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was just his way. If it didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit him to explain a thing to\r\nyou, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nno difference.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d got all that coat-of-arms business fixed, so now he started in to\r\nfinish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a\r\nmournful inscription\xe2\x80\x94said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He\r\nmade up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:\r\n\r\n  _1. Here a captive heart busted.\r\n\r\n   2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and\r\n   friends, fretted his sorrowful life.\r\n\r\n   3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went\r\n   to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.\r\n\r\n   4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven\r\n   years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,\r\n   natural son of Louis XIV._\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke\r\ndown. When he got done he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t no way make up his mind which one\r\nfor Jim to scrabble onto the wall, they was all so good; but at last\r\nhe allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would\r\ntake him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck onto the logs with a\r\nnail, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he\r\nwould block them out for him, and then he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have nothing to do\r\nbut just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to think, the logs ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to do; they don\xe2\x80\x99t have log\r\nwalls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfetch a rock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him\r\nsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever get\r\nout. But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look\r\nto see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most\r\npesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t give my hands no show to\r\nget well of the sores, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make no headway, hardly;\r\nso Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and\r\nmournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll smouch it,\r\nand carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt warn\xe2\x80\x99t no slouch of an idea; and it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no slouch of a\r\ngrindstone nuther; but we allowed we\xe2\x80\x99d tackle it. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nmidnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We\r\nsmouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a\r\nmost nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nher from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.\r\nTom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.\r\nWe got her half-way; and then we was plumb played out, and most\r\ndrownded with sweat. We see it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use; we got to go and fetch\r\nJim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg,\r\nand wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our\r\nhole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and\r\nwalked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. He could\r\nout-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do everything.\r\n\r\nOur hole was pretty big, but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t big enough to get the\r\ngrindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big\r\nenough. Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set\r\nJim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from\r\nthe rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the\r\nrest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide\r\nthe grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped\r\nhim fix his chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed\r\nourselves. But Tom thought of something, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got any spiders in here, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sah, thanks to goodness I hain\xe2\x80\x99t, Mars Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut bless you, honey, I doan\xe2\x80\x99 _want_ none. I\xe2\x80\x99s afeard un um. I jis\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x99s soon have rattlesnakes aroun\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom thought a minute or two, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. And I reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s been done. It _must_ \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\ndone; it stands to reason. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a prime good idea. Where could\r\nyou keep it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep what, Mars Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a rattlesnake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake\r\nto come in heah I\xe2\x80\x99d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would,\r\nwid my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Jim, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of it after a little. You could tame\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tame_ it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,\r\nand they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them. Any book\r\nwill tell you that. You try\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all I ask; just try for two or\r\nthree days. Why, you can get him so in a little while that he\xe2\x80\x99ll love\r\nyou; and sleep with you; and won\xe2\x80\x99t stay away from you a minute; and\r\nwill let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Please_, Tom\xe2\x80\x94_doan_\xe2\x80\x99 talk so! I can\xe2\x80\x99t _stan\xe2\x80\x99_ it! He\xe2\x80\x99d _let_ me\r\nshove his head in my mouf\xe2\x80\x94fer a favor, hain\xe2\x80\x99t it? I lay he\xe2\x80\x99d wait a\r\npow\xe2\x80\x99ful long time \xe2\x80\x99fo\xe2\x80\x99 I _ast_ him. En mo\xe2\x80\x99 en dat, I doan\xe2\x80\x99 _want_ him\r\nto sleep wid me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim, don\xe2\x80\x99t act so foolish. A prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s _got_ to have some kind of a\r\ndumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever been tried, why, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than\r\nany other way you could ever think of to save your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mars Tom, I doan\xe2\x80\x99 _want_ no sich glory. Snake take \xe2\x80\x99n bite Jim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchin off, den _whah_ is de glory? No, sah, I doan\xe2\x80\x99 want no sich\r\ndoin\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlame it, can\xe2\x80\x99t you _try?_ I only _want_ you to try\xe2\x80\x94you needn\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nit up if it don\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I\xe2\x80\x99s a-tryin\xe2\x80\x99 him.\r\nMars Tom, I\xe2\x80\x99s willin\xe2\x80\x99 to tackle mos\xe2\x80\x99 anything \xe2\x80\x99at ain\xe2\x80\x99t onreasonable,\r\nbut ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngwyne to _leave_, dat\xe2\x80\x99s _shore_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let it go, let it go, if you\xe2\x80\x99re so bull-headed about it.\r\nWe can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on\r\ntheir tails, and let on they\xe2\x80\x99re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that \xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI k\xe2\x80\x99n stan\xe2\x80\x99 _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99f I couldn\xe2\x80\x99 get along widout\r\num, I tell you dat. I never knowed b\xe2\x80\x99fo\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99twas so much bother and\r\ntrouble to be a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it _always_ is when it\xe2\x80\x99s done right. You got any rats around\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sah, I hain\xe2\x80\x99t seed none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you some rats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mars Tom, I doan\xe2\x80\x99 _want_ no rats. Dey\xe2\x80\x99s de dadblamedest creturs\r\nto \xe2\x80\x99sturb a body, en rustle roun\xe2\x80\x99 over \xe2\x80\x99im, en bite his feet, when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to sleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g\xe2\x80\x99yarter-snakes, \xe2\x80\x99f\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99s got to have \xe2\x80\x99m, but doan\xe2\x80\x99 gimme no rats; I hain\xe2\x80\x99 got no use f\xe2\x80\x99r\r\num, skasely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Jim, you _got_ to have \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94they all do. So don\xe2\x80\x99t make no more\r\nfuss about it. Prisoners ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever without rats. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\ninstance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them\r\ntricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play\r\nmusic to them. You got anything to play music on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99 got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o\xe2\x80\x99 paper, en a\r\njuice-harp; but I reck\xe2\x80\x99n dey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 take no stock in a juice-harp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes they would. _They_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care what kind of music \xe2\x80\x99tis. A\r\njews-harp\xe2\x80\x99s plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nprison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can\xe2\x80\x99t get no\r\nother kind out of a jew\xe2\x80\x99s-harp. It always interests them; they come\r\nout to see what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you. Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re all right; you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfixed very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to\r\nsleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jew\xe2\x80\x99s-harp; play \xe2\x80\x99The\r\nLast Link is Broken\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing that \xe2\x80\x99ll scoop a rat quicker \xe2\x80\x99n\r\nanything else; and when you\xe2\x80\x99ve played about two minutes you\xe2\x80\x99ll see all\r\nthe rats, and the snakes, and spiders and things begin to feel worried\r\nabout you, and come. And they\xe2\x80\x99ll just fairly swarm over you, and have\r\na noble good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _dey_ will, I reck\xe2\x80\x99n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_\r\nhavin\xe2\x80\x99? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it ef I got to. I\r\nreck\xe2\x80\x99n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in\r\nde house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing else; and\r\npretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you\r\nreckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doan\xe2\x80\x99 know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it\xe2\x80\x99s tolable dark in\r\nheah, en I ain\xe2\x80\x99 got no use f\xe2\x80\x99r no flower, nohow, en she\xe2\x80\x99d be a pow\xe2\x80\x99ful\r\nsight o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne er dem big cat-tail-lookin\xe2\x80\x99 mullen-stalks would grow in heah,\r\nMars Tom, I reck\xe2\x80\x99n, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be wuth half de trouble she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncoss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch you a little one, and you plant it\r\nin the corner over there, and raise it. And don\xe2\x80\x99t call it mullen, call\r\nit Pitchiola\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s its right name when it\xe2\x80\x99s in a prison. And you\r\nwant to water it with your tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the way they always do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid\r\nspring water whiles another man\xe2\x80\x99s a _start\xe2\x80\x99n_ one wid tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t the idea. You _got_ to do it with tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll die on my han\xe2\x80\x99s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan\xe2\x80\x99\r\nskasely ever cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would\r\nhave to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he\r\nwould go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would \xe2\x80\x9cjis\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99s soon have\r\ntobacker in his coffee\xe2\x80\x9d; and found so much fault with it, and with the\r\nwork and bother of raising the mullen, and jew\xe2\x80\x99s-harping the rats, and\r\npetting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of\r\nall the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and\r\njournals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and\r\nresponsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that\r\nTom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened\r\ndown with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world\r\nto make a name for himself, and yet he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know enough to\r\nappreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was\r\nsorry, and said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t behave so no more, and then me and Tom\r\nshoved for bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap\r\nand fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an\r\nhour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it\r\nand put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally\xe2\x80\x99s bed. But while we was\r\ngone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander\r\nPhelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats\r\nwould come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we\r\ngot back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the\r\nrats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her. So\r\nshe took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two\r\nhours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub,\r\nand they warn\xe2\x80\x99t the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the\r\npick of the flock. I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that\r\nfirst haul was.\r\n\r\nWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and\r\ncaterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnest, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The family was at home. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t give it right\r\nup, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntire them out or they\xe2\x80\x99d got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we\r\ngot allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all\r\nright again, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t set down convenient. And so we went for the\r\nsnakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and\r\nput them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was\r\nsupper-time, and a rattling good honest day\xe2\x80\x99s work: and hungry?\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\nno, I reckon not! And there warn\xe2\x80\x99t a blessed snake up there when we\r\nwent back\xe2\x80\x94we didn\xe2\x80\x99t half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow,\r\nand left. But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter much, because they was still on the\r\npremises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No,\r\nthere warn\xe2\x80\x99t no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a\r\nconsiderable spell. You\xe2\x80\x99d see them dripping from the rafters and\r\nplaces every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or\r\ndown the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nthem. Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no harm in\r\na million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally;\r\nshe despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped\r\ndown on her, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference what she was doing, she\r\nwould just lay that work down and light out. I never see such a woman.\r\nAnd you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get her to take\r\na-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found\r\none in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think\r\nthe house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he\r\ncould most wish there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever been no snakes created. Why, after\r\nevery last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a\r\nweek Aunt Sally warn\xe2\x80\x99t over it yet; she warn\xe2\x80\x99t near over it; when she\r\nwas setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back\r\nof her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her\r\nstockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He\r\nsaid they was made that way for some reason or other.\r\n\r\nWe got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she\r\nallowed these lickings warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing to what she would do if we ever\r\nloaded up the place again with them. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind the lickings,\r\nbecause they didn\xe2\x80\x99t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had\r\nto lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other\r\nthings; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim\xe2\x80\x99s was when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the\r\nspiders, and the spiders didn\xe2\x80\x99t like Jim; and so they\xe2\x80\x99d lay for him,\r\nand make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and\r\nthe snakes and the grindstone there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no room in bed for him,\r\nskasely; and when there was, a body couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, it was so lively,\r\nand it was always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at\r\none time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats\r\nwas on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so\r\nhe always had one gang under him, in his way, and t\xe2\x80\x99other gang having\r\na circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders\r\nwould take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got\r\nout this time he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\r\n\r\nWell, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.\r\nThe shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he\r\nwould get up and write a line in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;\r\nthe pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the\r\ngrindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the\r\nsawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we\r\nwas all going to die, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t. It was the most undigestible sawdust\r\nI ever see; and Tom said the same. But as I was saying, we\xe2\x80\x99d got all\r\nthe work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out,\r\ntoo, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a couple of times to the\r\nplantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t got no answer, because there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no such plantation; so he\r\nallowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans\r\npapers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold\r\nshivers, and I see we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the\r\nnonnamous letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s them?\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s done one\r\nway, sometimes another. But there\xe2\x80\x99s always somebody spying around that\r\ngives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going\r\nto light out of the Tooleries a servant-girl done it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very good\r\nway, and so is the nonnamous letters. We\xe2\x80\x99ll use them both. And it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nusual for the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s mother to change clothes with him, and she\r\nstays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We\xe2\x80\x99ll do that, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x99s up? Let them find it out for themselves\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s their\r\nlookout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know; but you can\xe2\x80\x99t depend on them. It\xe2\x80\x99s the way they\xe2\x80\x99ve acted\r\nfrom the very start\xe2\x80\x94left us to do _everything_. They\xe2\x80\x99re so confiding\r\nand mullet-headed they don\xe2\x80\x99t take notice of nothing at all. So if we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t _give_ them notice there won\xe2\x80\x99t be nobody nor nothing to\r\ninterfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this\r\nescape \xe2\x80\x99ll go off perfectly flat; won\xe2\x80\x99t amount to nothing\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nnothing _to_ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as for me, Tom, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way I\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks!\xe2\x80\x9d he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits\r\nme. What you going to do about the servant-girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook\r\nthat yaller girl\xe2\x80\x99s frock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, that \xe2\x80\x99ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she\r\nprob\xe2\x80\x99bly hain\xe2\x80\x99t got any but that one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the\r\nnonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my\r\nown togs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but there won\xe2\x80\x99t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is just\r\nto do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it\r\nor not. Hain\xe2\x80\x99t you got no principle at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t saying nothing; I\xe2\x80\x99m the servant-girl. Who\xe2\x80\x99s Jim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m his mother. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stuff Jim\xe2\x80\x99s clothes full of straw and lay it on his\r\nbed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim \xe2\x80\x99ll take the nigger\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s gown off of me and wear it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll all evade together. When\r\na prisoner of style escapes it\xe2\x80\x99s called an evasion. It\xe2\x80\x99s always called\r\nso when a king escapes, f\xe2\x80\x99rinstance. And the same with a king\xe2\x80\x99s son;\r\nit don\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference whether he\xe2\x80\x99s a natural one or an unnatural\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller\r\nwench\xe2\x80\x99s frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front\r\ndoor, the way Tom told me to. It said:\r\n\r\n   _Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout.\r\n      UNKNOWN FRIEND._\r\n\r\nNext night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull\r\nand crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a\r\ncoffin on the back door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been worse scared if the place had \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been full of\r\nghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and\r\nshivering through the air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9couch!\xe2\x80\x9d if anything fell, she jumped and said \xe2\x80\x9couch!\xe2\x80\x9d if you\r\nhappened to touch her, when she warn\xe2\x80\x99t noticing, she done the same;\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t face no way and be satisfied, because she allowed there\r\nwas something behind her every time\xe2\x80\x94so she was always a-whirling\r\naround sudden, and saying \xe2\x80\x9couch,\xe2\x80\x9d and before she\xe2\x80\x99d got two-thirds\r\naround she\xe2\x80\x99d whirl back again, and say it again; and she was afraid to\r\ngo to bed, but she dasn\xe2\x80\x99t set up. So the thing was working very well,\r\nTom said; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory. He said\r\nit showed it was done right.\r\n\r\nSo he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the\r\nstreak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we\r\nbetter do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going\r\nto have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down\r\nthe lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was\r\nasleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This\r\nletter said:\r\n\r\n_Don\xe2\x80\x99t betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang\r\nof cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your\r\nrunaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as\r\nyou will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang,\r\nbut have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life\r\nagain, and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from\r\nnorthards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and\r\ngo in the nigger\xe2\x80\x99s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a\r\ntin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep\r\nsoon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting\r\nhis chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them\r\nat your leasure. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything but just the way I am telling you;\r\nif you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I\r\ndo not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing._\r\n\r\n_UNKNOWN FRIEND._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went\r\nover the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took\r\na look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to\r\nsupper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhich end they was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the\r\nminute we was done supper, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us what the trouble was,\r\nand never let on a word about the new letter, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to,\r\nbecause we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we\r\nwas half up-stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar\r\ncubboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and\r\nwent to bed, and got up about half past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt\r\nSally\xe2\x80\x99s dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the butter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI laid out a hunk of it,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9con a piece of a corn-pone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _left_ it laid out, then\xe2\x80\x94it ain\xe2\x80\x99t here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can get along without it,\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can get along _with_ it, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he says; \xe2\x80\x9cjust you slide down\r\ncellar and fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and\r\ncome along. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and stuff the straw into Jim\xe2\x80\x99s clothes to\r\nrepresent his mother in disguise, and be ready to _ba_ like a sheep\r\nand shove soon as you get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of\r\ncorn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up-stairs\r\nvery stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes\r\nAunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and\r\nclapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou been down cellar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you been doing down there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoth\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Noth\xe2\x80\x99n!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t _know?_ Don\xe2\x80\x99t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what\r\nyou been _doing_ down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if\r\nI have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI reckoned she\xe2\x80\x99d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I\r\ns\xe2\x80\x99pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a\r\nsweat about every little thing that warn\xe2\x80\x99t yard-stick straight; so she\r\nsays, very decided:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You\r\nbeen up to something you no business to, and I lay I\xe2\x80\x99ll find out what\r\nit is before _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ done with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she went away as I opened the door and walked into the\r\nsetting-room. My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and\r\nevery one of them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a\r\nchair and set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a\r\nlittle, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying\r\nto look like they warn\xe2\x80\x99t; but I knowed they was, because they was\r\nalways taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching\r\ntheir heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their\r\nbuttons. I warn\xe2\x80\x99t easy myself, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take my hat off, all the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nI did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me,\r\nif she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we\xe2\x80\x99d overdone\r\nthis thing, and what a thundering hornet\xe2\x80\x99s nest we\xe2\x80\x99d got ourselves\r\ninto, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with\r\nJim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.\r\n\r\nAt last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nanswer them straight, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which end of me was up; because\r\nthese men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start\r\nright _now_ and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn\xe2\x80\x99t but a\r\nfew minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on\r\nand wait for the sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the\r\nquestions, and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my\r\ntracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and\r\nthe butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears;\r\nand pretty soon, when one of them says, \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99m_ for going and getting\r\nin the cabin _first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they\r\ncome,\xe2\x80\x9d I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my\r\nforehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the land\xe2\x80\x99s sake, what _is_ the matter with the child? He\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nthe brain-fever as shore as you\xe2\x80\x99re born, and they\xe2\x80\x99re oozing out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes\r\nthe bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and\r\nhugged me, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no worse; for luck\xe2\x80\x99s against us, and it never rains but it\r\npours, and when I see that truck I thought we\xe2\x80\x99d lost you, for I knowed\r\nby the color and all it was just like your brains would be if\xe2\x80\x94Dear,\r\ndear, whyd\xe2\x80\x99nt you _tell_ me that was what you\xe2\x80\x99d been down there for,\r\n_I_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 cared. Now cler out to bed, and don\xe2\x80\x99t lemme see no\r\nmore of you till morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was up-stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another\r\none, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly\r\nget my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could\r\nwe must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose\xe2\x80\x94the house full of\r\nmen, yonder, with guns!\r\n\r\nHis eyes just blazed; and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x94is that so? _Ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over\r\nagain, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry! _hurry!_\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s dressed, and everything\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll slide out and give the\r\nsheep-signal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\r\nbegin to fumble with the padlock, and heard a man say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _told_ you we\xe2\x80\x99d be too soon; they haven\xe2\x80\x99t come\xe2\x80\x94the door is locked.\r\nHere, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for \xe2\x80\x99em in the\r\ndark and kill \xe2\x80\x99em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,\r\nand listen if you can hear \xe2\x80\x99em coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo in they come, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see us in the dark, and most trod on us\r\nwhilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all\r\nright, and out through the hole, swift but soft\xe2\x80\x94Jim first, me next,\r\nand Tom last, which was according to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s orders. Now we was in the\r\nlean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the\r\ndoor, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he\r\nwould listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim\r\nmust glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and\r\nlistened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around\r\nout there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and\r\nstooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and\r\nslipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all\r\nright, and me and Jim over it; but Tom\xe2\x80\x99s britches catched fast on a\r\nsplinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had\r\nto pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he\r\ndropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that? Answer, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut we didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then\r\nthere was a rush, and a _bang_, _bang_, _bang!_ and the bullets fairly\r\nwhizzed around us! We heard them sing out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are! They\xe2\x80\x99ve broke for the river! After \xe2\x80\x99em, boys, and turn\r\nloose the dogs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore\r\nboots and yelled, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t wear no boots and didn\xe2\x80\x99t yell. We was\r\nin the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close onto us we\r\ndodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\r\nthem. They\xe2\x80\x99d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t scare off the\r\nrobbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they\r\ncome, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we\r\nstopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just\r\nsaid howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering;\r\nand then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was\r\nnearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my\r\ncanoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the\r\nmiddle of the river, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t make no more noise than we was\r\nobleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island\r\nwhere my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each\r\nother all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got\r\ndim and died out. And when we stepped onto the raft I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_, old Jim, you\xe2\x80\x99re a free man _again_, and I bet you won\xe2\x80\x99t ever be\r\na slave no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEn a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It \xe2\x80\x99uz planned beautiful, en\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99uz _done_ beautiful; en dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmo\xe2\x80\x99 mixed up en splendid den what dat one wuz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all\r\nbecause he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.\r\n\r\nWhen me and Jim heard that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel as brash as what we did\r\nbefore. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him\r\nin the wigwam and tore up one of the duke\xe2\x80\x99s shirts for to bandage him,\r\nbut he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop now; don\xe2\x80\x99t fool around\r\nhere, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and\r\nset her loose! Boys, we done it elegant!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99deed we did. I wish _we\xe2\x80\x99d_\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been no \xe2\x80\x98Son of\r\nSaint Louis, ascend to heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 wrote down in _his_ biography; no,\r\nsir, we\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 whooped him over the _border_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done\r\nwith _him_\xe2\x80\x94and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man the\r\nsweeps\xe2\x80\x94man the sweeps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut me and Jim was consulting\xe2\x80\x94and thinking. And after we\xe2\x80\x99d thought a\r\nminute, I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it, Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz _him_ dat \xe2\x80\x99uz\r\nbein\xe2\x80\x99 sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, \xe2\x80\x99Go\r\non en save me, nemmine \xe2\x80\x99bout a doctor f\xe2\x80\x99r to save dis one\xe2\x80\x99? Is dat\r\nlike Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You _bet_ he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t! _Well_,\r\nden, is _Jim_ gywne to say it? No, sah\xe2\x80\x94I doan\xe2\x80\x99 budge a step out\xe2\x80\x99n dis\r\nplace \xe2\x80\x99dout a _doctor_; not if it\xe2\x80\x99s forty year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he\xe2\x80\x99d say what he did\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a\r\ndoctor. He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to\r\nit and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft\r\nloose himself; but we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him. Then he give us a piece of his\r\nmind, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good.\r\n\r\nSo when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if you\xe2\x80\x99re bound to go, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the way to do when\r\nyou get to the village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight\r\nand fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a\r\npurse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around\r\nthe back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here\r\nin the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him\r\nand take his chalk away from him, and don\xe2\x80\x99t give it back to him till\r\nyou get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he\r\ncan find it again. It\xe2\x80\x99s the way they all do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he\r\nsee the doctor coming till he was gone again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I\r\ngot him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island\r\nhunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found,\r\nand about midnight he must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 kicked his gun in his dreams, for it\r\nwent off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there\r\nand fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because\r\nwe wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is your folks?\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Phelpses, down yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. And after a minute, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d you say he got shot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cand it shot him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSingular dream,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\nSo he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But\r\nwhen he see the canoe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the look of her\xe2\x80\x94said she was big\r\nenough for one, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t look pretty safe for two. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat three?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, me and Sid, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and _the guns_; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\nBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,\r\nand said he reckoned he\xe2\x80\x99d look around for a bigger one. But they was\r\nall locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\r\ntill he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\r\ngo down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I\r\nsaid I didn\xe2\x80\x99t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nI struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos\xe2\x80\x99n he can\xe2\x80\x99t fix\r\nthat leg just in three shakes of a sheep\xe2\x80\x99s tail, as the saying is?\r\nspos\xe2\x80\x99n it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do?\xe2\x80\x94lay\r\naround there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; I know what\r\n_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he\xe2\x80\x99s got to go\r\nany more I\xe2\x80\x99ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll take and tie\r\nhim, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom\xe2\x80\x99s done\r\nwith him we\xe2\x80\x99ll give him what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, or all we got, and then let\r\nhim get ashore.\r\n\r\nSo then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\r\nwaked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s house, but they told me he\xe2\x80\x99d gone away in the night some time\r\nor other, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad\r\nfor Tom, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll dig out for the island right off. So away I shoved,\r\nand turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstomach! He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _Tom!_ Where you been all this time, you rascal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ hain\xe2\x80\x99t been nowheres,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9conly just hunting for the runaway\r\nnigger\xe2\x80\x94me and Sid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, where ever did you go?\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cYour aunt\xe2\x80\x99s been mighty\r\nuneasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe needn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we was all right. We followed the men\r\nand the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we\r\nheard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and\r\ncrossed over, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find nothing of them; so we cruised along\r\nup-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe\r\nand went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we\r\npaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid\xe2\x80\x99s at the post-office to\r\nsee what he can hear, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a-branching out to get something to eat\r\nfor us, and then we\xe2\x80\x99re going home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then we went to the post-office to get \xe2\x80\x9cSid\xe2\x80\x9d; but just as I\r\nsuspicioned, he warn\xe2\x80\x99t there; so the old man he got a letter out of\r\nthe office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn\xe2\x80\x99t come; so the\r\nold man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he\r\ngot done fooling around\xe2\x80\x94but we would ride. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get him to let\r\nme stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use in it, and I\r\nmust come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and\r\ncried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern\r\nthat don\xe2\x80\x99t amount to shucks, and said she\xe2\x80\x99d serve Sid the same when he\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAnd the place was plum full of farmers and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives, to dinner;\r\nand such another clack a body never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the\r\nworst; her tongue was a-going all the time. She says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sister Phelps, I\xe2\x80\x99ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nb\xe2\x80\x99lieve the nigger was crazy. I says to Sister Damrell\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t I,\r\nSister Damrell?\xe2\x80\x94s\xe2\x80\x99I, he\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, s\xe2\x80\x99I\xe2\x80\x94them\xe2\x80\x99s the very words I said.\r\nYou all hearn me: he\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, s\xe2\x80\x99I; everything shows it, s\xe2\x80\x99I.

Why, they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nstole everything they could lay their hands on\xe2\x80\x94and we a-watching all\r\nthe time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o\xe2\x80\x99 the line! and\r\nas for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther\xe2\x80\x99 ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\ntelling how many times they _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ steal that; and flour, and\r\ncandles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and\r\nmost a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico\r\ndress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day\r\n_and_ night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch\r\nhide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last\r\nminute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and\r\nfools us, and not only fools _us_ but the Injun Territory robbers too,\r\nand actuly gets _away_ with that nigger safe and sound, and that with\r\nsixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very\r\ntime!

Why, they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsteal the very\xe2\x80\x94why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a\r\nfluster _I_ was in by the time midnight come last night. I hope to\r\ngracious if I warn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid they\xe2\x80\x99d steal some o\xe2\x80\x99 the family! I was\r\njust to that pass I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no reasoning faculties no more. It\r\nlooks foolish enough _now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s my two poor boys asleep, \xe2\x80\x99way up-stairs in that lonesome room,\r\nand I declare to goodness I was that uneasy \xe2\x80\x99t I crep\xe2\x80\x99 up there and\r\nlocked \xe2\x80\x99em in! I _did_. And anybody would. Because, you know, when you\r\nget scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and\r\nworse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to\r\ndoing all sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 wild things, and by and by you think to yourself,\r\nspos\xe2\x80\x99n _I_ was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain\xe2\x80\x99t locked,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned\r\nher head around slow, and when her eye lit on me\xe2\x80\x94I got up and took a\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nSays I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that\r\nroom this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.\r\nSo I done it. But I dasn\xe2\x80\x99t go fur, or she\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 sent for me. And when\r\nit was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and\r\ntold her the noise and shooting waked up me and \xe2\x80\x9cSid,\xe2\x80\x9d and the door\r\nwas locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the\r\nlightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t never\r\nwant to try _that_ no more. And then I went on and told her all what I\r\ntold Uncle Silas before; and then she said she\xe2\x80\x99d forgive us, and maybe\r\nit was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of\r\nboys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could\r\nsee; and so, as long as no harm hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come of it, she judged she\r\nbetter put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she\r\nhad us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done. So then\r\nshe kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a\r\nbrown-study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, lawsamercy, it\xe2\x80\x99s most night, and Sid not come yet! What _has_\r\nbecome of that boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI see my chance; so I skips up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run right up to town and get him,\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll stay right wher\xe2\x80\x99 you are; _one\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\nenough to be lost at a time. If he ain\xe2\x80\x99t here to supper, your uncle\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, he warn\xe2\x80\x99t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.\r\n\r\nHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn\xe2\x80\x99t run across Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrack. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said\r\nthere warn\xe2\x80\x99t no occasion to be\xe2\x80\x94boys will be boys, he said, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right. So she had to\r\nbe satisfied. But she said she\xe2\x80\x99d set up for him awhile anyway, and\r\nkeep a light burning so he could see it.\r\n\r\nAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her\r\ncandle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and\r\nlike I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and\r\ntalked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me\r\nevery now and then if I reckoned he could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got lost, or hurt, or\r\nmaybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres\r\nsuffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears\r\nwould drip down silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right,\r\nand would be home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand,\r\nor maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it,\r\nbecause it done her good, and she was in so much trouble. And when she\r\nwas going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe door ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to be locked, Tom, and there\xe2\x80\x99s the window and\r\nthe rod; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be good, _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ you? And you won\xe2\x80\x99t go? For _my_\r\nsake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all\r\nintending to go; but after that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 went, not for kingdoms.\r\n\r\nBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very\r\nrestless. And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped\r\naround front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window\r\nwith her eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I\r\ncould do something for her, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, only to swear that I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t never do nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time I\r\nwaked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle\r\nwas most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she\r\nwas asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old man was up-town again before breakfast, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get no\r\ntrack of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not\r\nsaying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold,\r\nand not eating anything. And by and by the old man says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I give you the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one I got yesterday out of the post-office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me no letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 forgot it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had\r\nlaid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s from St. Petersburg\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s from Sis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stir. But\r\nbefore she could break it open she dropped it and run\xe2\x80\x94for she see\r\nsomething. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old\r\ndoctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind\r\nhim; and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that\r\ncome handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s dead, he\xe2\x80\x99s dead, I know he\xe2\x80\x99s dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,\r\nwhich showed he warn\xe2\x80\x99t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s alive, thank God! And that\xe2\x80\x99s enough!\xe2\x80\x9d and she snatched a kiss of\r\nhim, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering\r\norders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as\r\nher tongue could go, every jump of the way.\r\n\r\nI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the\r\nold doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men\r\nwas very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to\r\nall the other niggers around there, so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be trying to run\r\naway like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a\r\nwhole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others\r\nsaid, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer at all; he ain\xe2\x80\x99t our nigger, and\r\nhis owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled\r\nthem down a little, because the people that\xe2\x80\x99s always the most anxious\r\nfor to hang a nigger that hain\xe2\x80\x99t done just right is always the very\r\nones that ain\xe2\x80\x99t the most anxious to pay for him when they\xe2\x80\x99ve got their\r\nsatisfaction out of him.\r\n\r\nThey cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side\r\nthe head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let\r\non to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own\r\nclothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this\r\ntime, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his\r\nhands, too, and both legs, and said he warn\xe2\x80\x99t to have nothing but\r\nbread and water to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold\r\nat auction because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come in a certain length of time, and\r\nfilled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand\r\nwatch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the\r\ndoor in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job\r\nand was tapering off with a kind of generl good-by cussing, and then\r\nthe old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be no rougher on him than you\xe2\x80\x99re obleeged to, because he ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cut\r\nthe bullet out without some help, and he warn\xe2\x80\x99t in no condition for me\r\nto leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little\r\nworse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nme come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he\xe2\x80\x99d kill\r\nme, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nanything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and\r\nthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I\r\njudged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was!_ and there I had\r\nto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.\r\nIt was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills,\r\nand of course I\xe2\x80\x99d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I\r\ndasn\xe2\x80\x99t, because the nigger might get away, and then I\xe2\x80\x99d be to blame;\r\nand yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had\r\nto stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger\r\nthat was a better nuss or faithfuler, and yet he was risking his\r\nfreedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell\r\nyou, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nkind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing\r\nas well there as he would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done at home\xe2\x80\x94better, maybe, because it\r\nwas so quiet; but there I _was_, with both of \xe2\x80\x99m on my hands, and\r\nthere I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a\r\nskiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting\r\nby the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I\r\nmotioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and\r\ntied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no\r\ntrouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we\r\nmuffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice\r\nand quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word\r\nfrom the start. He ain\xe2\x80\x99t no bad nigger, gentlemen; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think\r\nabout him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomebody says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it sounds very good, doctor, I\xe2\x80\x99m obleeged to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful\r\nto that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was\r\naccording to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good\r\nheart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they\r\nall agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have\r\nsome notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised,\r\nright out and hearty, that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cuss him no more.\r\n\r\nThen they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he\r\ncould have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten\r\nheavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it, and I reckoned it warn\xe2\x80\x99t best for me to mix\r\nin, but I judged I\xe2\x80\x99d get the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or\r\nother as soon as I\xe2\x80\x99d got through the breakers that was laying just\r\nahead of me\xe2\x80\x94explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about\r\nSid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted\r\nnight paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.\r\n\r\nBut I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day\r\nand all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I\r\ndodged him.\r\n\r\nNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt\r\nSally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I\r\nfound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that\r\nwould wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and\r\npale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and\r\nlaid for him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding\r\nin, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still,\r\nand set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be\r\njoyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nsleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuler\r\nall the time, and ten to one he\xe2\x80\x99d wake up in his right mind.\r\n\r\nSo we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his\r\neyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x94why, I\xe2\x80\x99m at _home!_ How\xe2\x80\x99s that? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the raft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _Jim?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it pretty brash. But he never\r\nnoticed, but says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! Splendid! _Now_ we\xe2\x80\x99re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout what, Sid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, about the way the whole thing was done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat whole thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _the_ whole thing. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t but one; how we set the runaway\r\nnigger free\xe2\x80\x94me and Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood land! Set the run\xe2\x80\x94What _is_ the child talking about! Dear,\r\ndear, out of his head again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_No_, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t out of my HEAD; I know all what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. We\r\n_did_ set him free\xe2\x80\x94me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we _done_\r\nit. And we done it elegant, too.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99d got a start, and she never\r\nchecked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip\r\nalong, and I see it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use for _me_ to put in. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Aunty, it\r\ncost us a power of work\xe2\x80\x94weeks of it\xe2\x80\x94hours and hours, every night,\r\nwhilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet,\r\nand the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and\r\ncase-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and\r\njust no end of things, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t think what work it was to make\r\nthe saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t think _half_ the fun it was. And we had to make up the\r\npictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the\r\nrobbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into\r\nthe cabin, and make the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie,\r\nand send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy sakes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company\r\nfor Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat\r\nthat you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come\r\nbefore we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us\r\nand let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path\r\nand let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in\r\nus, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for\r\nthe raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all\r\nby ourselves, and _wasn\xe2\x80\x99t_ it bully, Aunty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was\r\n_you_, you little rapscallions, that\xe2\x80\x99s been making all this trouble,\r\nand turned everybody\xe2\x80\x99s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to\r\ndeath. I\xe2\x80\x99ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 you this very minute. To think, here I\xe2\x80\x99ve been, night after night,\r\na\xe2\x80\x94_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I\xe2\x80\x99ll tan the\r\nOld Harry out o\xe2\x80\x99 both o\xe2\x80\x99 ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ hold in, and\r\nhis tongue just _went_ it\xe2\x80\x94she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all\r\nalong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and\r\nshe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I\r\ntell you if I catch you meddling with him again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeddling with _who?_\xe2\x80\x9d Tom says, dropping his smile and looking\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith _who?_ Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who\xe2\x80\x99d you reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom looks at me very grave, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell me he was all right? Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he got away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Him?_\xe2\x80\x9d says Aunt Sally; \xe2\x80\x9cthe runaway nigger? \xe2\x80\x99Deed he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got him back, safe and sound, and he\xe2\x80\x99s in that cabin again, on\r\nbread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he\xe2\x80\x99s claimed or\r\nsold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening\r\nand shutting like gills, and sings out to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey hain\xe2\x80\x99t no _right_ to shut him up! _Shove!_\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t you lose a\r\nminute. Turn him loose! he ain\xe2\x80\x99t no slave; he\xe2\x80\x99s as free as any cretur\r\nthat walks this earth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _does_ the child mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don\xe2\x80\x99t go,\r\n_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ go. I\xe2\x80\x99ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old\r\nMiss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was\r\ngoing to sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free\r\nin her will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was\r\nalready free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that _is_ a question, I must say; and _just_ like women! Why, I\r\nwanted the _adventure_ of it; and I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 waded neck-deep in blood\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf she warn\xe2\x80\x99t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as\r\nsweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\r\n\r\nAunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and\r\ncried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,\r\nfor it was getting pretty sultry for _us_, seemed to me. And I peeped\r\nout, and in a little while Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and\r\nstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles\xe2\x80\x94kind of\r\ngrinding him into the earth, you know. And then she says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you _better_ turn y\xe2\x80\x99r head away\xe2\x80\x94I would if I was you, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, deary me!\xe2\x80\x9d says Aunt Sally; \xe2\x80\x9c_is_ he changed so? Why, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_Tom_, it\xe2\x80\x99s Sid; Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94why, where is Tom? He was here a minute\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean where\xe2\x80\x99s Huck _Finn_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean! I reckon I hain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nraised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I\r\n_see_ him. That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that\r\nbed, Huck Finn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I done it. But not feeling brash.\r\n\r\nAunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they\r\ntold it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a\r\nprayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation,\r\nbecause the oldest man in the world couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 understood it. So\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to\r\nup and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took\r\nme for Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x94she chipped in and says, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, go on and call me\r\nAunt Sally, I\xe2\x80\x99m used to it now, and \xe2\x80\x99taint no need to change\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwhen Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it\xe2\x80\x94there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno other way, and I knowed he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, because it would be nuts\r\nfor him, being a mystery, and he\xe2\x80\x99d make an adventure out of it, and be\r\nperfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid,\r\nand made things as soft as he could for me.\r\n\r\nAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson\r\nsetting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone\r\nand took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how\r\nhe _could_ help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.\r\n\r\nWell, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom\r\nand _Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that\r\nway without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all\r\nthe way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that\r\ncreetur\xe2\x80\x99s up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get any\r\nanswer out of you about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I never heard nothing from you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Aunt Sally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean\r\nby Sid being here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never got \xe2\x80\x99em. Sis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94_what?_\xe2\x80\x9d he says, kind of pettish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you what _me_, you impudent thing\xe2\x80\x94hand out them letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Them_ letters. I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re in the trunk. There, now. And they\xe2\x80\x99re just the same as they\r\nwas when I got them out of the office. I hain\xe2\x80\x99t looked into them, I\r\nhain\xe2\x80\x99t touched them. But I knowed they\xe2\x80\x99d make trouble, and I thought\r\nif you warn\xe2\x80\x99t in no hurry, I\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _do_ need skinning, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no mistake about it. And I\r\nwrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s\xe2\x80\x99pose he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it come yesterday; I hain\xe2\x80\x99t read it yet, but _it\xe2\x80\x99s_ all right,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got that one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, but I reckoned maybe\r\nit was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea,\r\ntime of the evasion?\xe2\x80\x94what it was he\xe2\x80\x99d planned to do if the evasion\r\nworked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already\r\nfree before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the\r\nstart, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the\r\nriver on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the\r\nriver, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up\r\nhome on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and\r\nwrite word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them\r\nwaltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and\r\nthen he would be a hero, and so would we. But I reckoned it was about\r\nas well the way it was.\r\n\r\nWe had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle\r\nSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse\r\nTom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and\r\ngive him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And\r\nwe had him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim\r\nforty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so\r\ngood, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dah_, now, Huck, what I tell you?\xe2\x80\x94what I tell you up dah on Jackson\r\nIslan\xe2\x80\x99? I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas\xe2\x80\x99, en what\xe2\x80\x99s de sign un it; en I\r\n_tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _ag\xe2\x80\x99in;_ en it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncome true; en heah she _is! Dah_, now! doan\xe2\x80\x99 talk to _me_\xe2\x80\x94signs is\r\n_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99s well \xe2\x80\x99at I \xe2\x80\x99uz gwineter\r\nbe rich ag\xe2\x80\x99in as I\xe2\x80\x99s a-stannin\xe2\x80\x99 heah dis minute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthree slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go\r\nfor howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the territory, for\r\na couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nnone from home, because it\xe2\x80\x99s likely pap\xe2\x80\x99s been back before now, and\r\ngot it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he hain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom says; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all there yet\xe2\x80\x94six thousand dollars\r\nand more; and your pap hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever been back since. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t when I come\r\naway, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim says, kind of solemn:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 back no mo\xe2\x80\x99, Huck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Jim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNemmine why, Huck\xe2\x80\x94but he ain\xe2\x80\x99t comin\xe2\x80\x99 back no mo\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I kept at him; so at last he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoan\xe2\x80\x99 you \xe2\x80\x99member de house dat was float\xe2\x80\x99n down de river, en dey wuz\r\na man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn\xe2\x80\x99 let\r\nyou come in? Well, den, you kin git yo\xe2\x80\x99 money when you wants it, kase\r\ndat wuz him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a\r\nwatch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it,\r\nbecause if I\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 tackled it, and ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to no more. But I reckon I\r\ngot to light out for the territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt\r\nSally she\xe2\x80\x99s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. I\r\nbeen there before.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 32325-0.txt or 32325-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/3/2/32325/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
