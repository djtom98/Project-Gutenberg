This civil war and its remarkable events were remembered by\r\nthe existing generation without any degree of the bitterness of spirit\r\nwhich seldom fails to attend internal dissension. The Highlanders, who\r\nformed the principal strength of Charles Edward\'s army, were an ancient\r\nand high-spirited race, peculiar in their habits of war and of peace,\r\nbrave to romance, and exhibiting a character turning upon points more\r\nadapted to poetry than to the prose of real life. Their prince, young,\r\nvaliant, patient of fatigue, and despising danger, heading his army\r\non foot in the most toilsome marches, and defeating a regular force\r\nin three battles--all these were circumstances fascinating to the\r\nimagination, and might well be supposed to seduce young and enthusiastic\r\nminds to the cause in which they were found united, although wisdom and\r\nreason frowned upon the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous prince, as is well known, proved to be one of\r\nthose personages who distinguish themselves during some single and\r\nextraordinarily brilliant period of their lives, like the course of a\r\nshooting-star, at which men wonder, as well on account of the\r\nbriefness, as the brilliancy of its splendour. A long tract of darkness\r\novershadowed the subsequent life of a man who, in his youth, showed\r\nhimself so capable of great undertakings; and, without the painful task\r\nof tracing his course farther, we may say the latter pursuits and habits\r\nof this unhappy prince are those painfully evincing a broken heart,\r\nwhich seeks refuge from its own thoughts in sordid enjoyments.\r\n\r\nStill, however, it was long ere Charles Edward appeared to be, perhaps\r\nit was long ere he altogether became, so much degraded from his original\r\nself; as he enjoyed for a time the lustre attending the progress and\r\ntermination of his enterprise. Those who thought they discerned in his\r\nsubsequent conduct an insensibility to the distresses of his followers,\r\ncoupled with that egotistical attention to his own interests which has\r\nbeen often attributed to the Stuart family, and which is the natural\r\neffect of the principles of divine right in which they were brought up,\r\nwere now generally considered as dissatisfied and splenetic persons,\r\nwho, displeased with the issue of their adventure and finding themselves\r\ninvolved in the ruins of a falling cause, indulged themselves in\r\nundeserved reproaches against their leader. Indeed, such censures were\r\nby no means frequent among those of his followers who, if what was\r\nalleged had been just, had the best right to complain. Far the greater\r\nnumber of those unfortunate gentlemen suffered with the most dignified\r\npatience, and were either too proud to take notice of ill-treatment an\r\nthe part of their prince, or so prudent as to be aware their complaints\r\nwould meet with little sympathy from the world. It may be added, that\r\nthe greater part of the banished Jacobites, and those of high rank and\r\nconsequence, were not much within reach of the influence of the prince\'s\r\ncharacter and conduct, whether well regulated or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime that great Jacobite conspiracy, of which the\r\ninsurrection of 1745-6 was but a small part precipitated into action on\r\nthe failure of a far more general scheme, was resumed and again put into\r\nmotion by the Jacobites of England, whose force had never been broken,\r\nas they had prudently avoided bringing it into the field. The surprising\r\neffect which had been produced by small means, in 1745-6, animated their\r\nhopes for more important successes, when the whole nonjuring interest\r\nof Britain, identified as it then was with great part of the landed\r\ngentlemen, should come forward to finish what had been gallantly\r\nattempted by a few Highland chiefs.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, indeed, that the Jacobites of the day were incapable of\r\nconsidering that the very small scale on which the effort was made, was\r\nin one great measure the cause of its unexpected success. The remarkable\r\nspeed with which the insurgents marched, the singularly good discipline\r\nwhich they preserved, the union and unanimity which for some time\r\nanimated their councils, were all in a considerable degree produced\r\nby the smallness of their numbers. Notwithstanding the discomfiture\r\nof Charles Edward, the nonjurors of the period long continued to nurse\r\nunlawful schemes, and to drink treasonable toasts, until age stole upon\r\nthem. Another generation arose, who did not share the sentiments which\r\nthey cherished; and at length the sparkles of disaffection, which had\r\nlong smouldered, but had never been heated enough to burst into actual\r\nflame, became entirely extinguished. But in proportion as the political\r\nenthusiasm died gradually away among men of ordinary temperament, it\r\ninfluenced those of warm imaginations and weak understandings, and hence\r\nwild schemes were formed, as desperate as they were adventurous.\r\n\r\nThus a young Scottishman of rank is said to have stooped so low as to\r\nplot the surprisal of St. James\'s Palace, and the assassination of the\r\nroyal family. While these ill-digested and desperate conspiracies were\r\nagitated among the few Jacobites who still adhered with more obstinacy\r\nto their purpose, there is no question but that other plots might have\r\nbeen brought to an open explosion, had it not suited the policy of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole rather to prevent or disable the conspirators in their\r\nprojects, than to promulgate the tale of danger, which might thus have\r\nbeen believed to be more widely diffused than was really the case.\r\n\r\nIn one instance alone this very prudential and humane line of conduct\r\nwas departed from, and the event seemed to confirm the policy of the\r\ngeneral course. Doctor Archibald Cameron, brother of the celebrated\r\nDonald Cameron of Lochiel, attainted for the rebellion of 1745, was\r\nfound by a party of soldiers lurking with a comrade in the wilds of Loch\r\nKatrine five or six years after the battle of Culloden, and was there\r\nseized. There were circumstances in his case, so far as was made known\r\nto the public, which attracted much compassion, and gave to the judicial\r\nproceedings against him an appearance of cold-blooded revenge on the\r\npart of government; and the following argument of a zealous Jacobite in\r\nhis favour, was received as conclusive by Dr. Johnson and other persons\r\nwho might pretend to impartiality. Dr. Cameron had never borne arms,\r\nalthough engaged in the Rebellion, but used his medical skill for the\r\nservice, indifferently, of the wounded of both parties. His return to\r\nScotland was ascribed exclusively to family affairs. His behaviour at\r\nthe bar was decent, firm, and respectful. His wife threw herself, on\r\nthree different occasions, before George II and the members of his\r\nfamily, was rudely repulsed from their presence, and at length placed,\r\nit was said, in the same prison with her husband, and confined with\r\nunmanly severity.\r\n\r\nDr. Cameron was finally executed with all the severities of the law of\r\ntreason; and his death remains in popular estimation a dark blot upon\r\nthe memory of George II, being almost publicly imputed to a mean and\r\npersonal hatred of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, the sufferer\'s heroic\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nYet the fact was that whether the execution of Archibald Cameron was\r\npolitical or otherwise, it might certainly have been justified, had\r\nthe king\'s ministers so pleased, upon reasons of a public nature. The\r\nunfortunate sufferer had not come to the Highlands solely upon his\r\nprivate affairs, as was the general belief; but it was not judged\r\nprudent by the English ministry to let it be generally known that\r\nhe came to inquire about a considerable sum of money which had been\r\nremitted from France to the friends of the exiled family. He had also a\r\ncommission to hold intercourse with the well-known M\'Pherson of Cluny,\r\nchief of the clan Vourich, whom the Chevalier had left behind at his\r\ndeparture from Scotland in 1746, and who remained during ten years of\r\nproscription and danger, skulking from place to place in the Highlands,\r\nand maintaining an uninterrupted correspondence between Charles and his\r\nfriends. That Dr. Cameron should have held a commission to assist this\r\nchief in raking together the dispersed embers of disaffection, is in\r\nitself sufficiently natural, and, considering his political principles,\r\nin no respect dishonourable to his memory. But neither ought it to be\r\nimputed to George II that he suffered the laws to be enforced against\r\na person taken in the act of breaking them. When he lost his hazardous\r\ngame, Dr. Cameron only paid the forfeit which he must have calculated\r\nupon. The ministers, however, thought it proper to leave Dr. Cameron\'s\r\nnew schemes in concealment, lest, by divulging them, they had indicated\r\nthe channel of communication which, it is now well known, they possessed\r\nto all the plots of Charles Edward. But it was equally ill advised and\r\nungenerous to sacrifice the character of the king to the policy of the\r\nadministration. Both points might have been gained by sparing the\r\nlife of Dr. Cameron after conviction, and limiting his punishment to\r\nperpetual exile.\r\n\r\nThese repeated and successive Jacobite plots rose and burst like bubbles\r\non a fountain; and one of them, at least, the Chevalier judged of\r\nimportance enough to induce him to risk himself within the dangerous\r\nprecincts of the British capital. This appears from Dr. King\'s ANECDOTES\r\nOF HIS OWN TIMES.\r\n\r\n\'September, 1750.--I received a note from my Lady Primrose, who desired\r\nto see me immediately. As soon as I waited on her, she led me into her\r\ndressing-room, and presented me to--\' [the Chevalier, doubtless]. \'If\r\nI was surprised to find him there, I was still more astonished when he\r\nacquainted me with the motives which had induced him to hazard a journey\r\nto England at this juncture. The impatience of his friends who were in\r\nexile had formed a scheme which was impracticable; but although it had\r\nbeen as feasible as they had represented it to him, yet no preparation\r\nhad been made, nor was anything ready to carry it into execution. He was\r\nsoon convinced that he had been deceived; and, therefore, after a stay\r\nin London of five days only, he returned to the place from whence he\r\ncame.\' Dr. King was in 1750 a keen Jacobite, as may be inferred from the\r\nvisit made by him to the prince under such circumstances, and from his\r\nbeing one of that unfortunate person\'s chosen correspondents. He, as\r\nwell as other men of sense and observation, began to despair of\r\nmaking their fortune in the party which they had chosen. It was indeed\r\nsufficiently dangerous; for, during the short visit just described,\r\none of Dr. King\'s servants remarked the stranger\'s likeness to Prince\r\nCharles, whom he recognized from the common busts.\r\n\r\nThe occasion taken for breaking up the Stuart interest we shall tell in\r\nDr. King\'s own words:--\'When he (Charles Edward) was in Scotland, he had\r\na mistress whose name was Walkinshaw, and whose sister was at that time,\r\nand is still, housekeeper at Leicester House. Some years after he was\r\nreleased from his prison, and conducted out of France, he sent for\r\nthis girl, who soon acquired such a dominion over him, that she was\r\nacquainted with all his schemes, and trusted with his most secret\r\ncorrespondence. As soon as this was known in England, all those persons\r\nof distinction who were attached to him were greatly alarmed: they\r\nimagined that this wench had been placed in his family by the English\r\nministers; and, considering her sister\'s situation, they seemed to have\r\nsome ground for their suspicion; wherefore, they dispatched a gentleman\r\nto Paris, where the prince then was, who had instructions to insist that\r\nMrs. Walkinshaw should be removed to a convent for a certain term; but\r\nher gallant absolutely refused to comply with this demand; and although\r\nMr. M\'Namara, the gentleman who was sent to him, who has a natural\r\neloquence and an excellent understanding, urged the most cogent reasons,\r\nand used all the arts of persuasion, to induce him to part with his\r\nmistress, and even proceeded so far as to assure him, according to his\r\ninstructions, that an immediate interruption of all correspondence with\r\nhis most powerful friends in England, and, in short, that the ruin of\r\nhis interest, which was now daily increasing, would be the infallible\r\nconsequence of his refusal; yet he continued inflexible, and all\r\nM\'Namara\'s entreaties and remonstrances were ineffectual. M\'Namara\r\nstayed in Paris some days beyond the time prescribed him, endeavouring\r\nto reason the prince into a better temper; but finding him obstinately\r\npersevere in his first answer, he took his leave with concern and\r\nindignation, saying, as he passed out, "What has your family done, sir,\r\nthus to draw down the vengeance of Heaven on every branch of it, through\r\nso many ages?" It is worthy of remark, that in all the conferences which\r\nM\'Namara had with the prince on this occasion, the latter declared that\r\nit was not a violent passion, or indeed any particular regard, which\r\nattached him to Mrs. Walkinshaw and that he could see her removed from\r\nhim without any concern; but he would not receive directions, in respect\r\nto his private conduct, from any man alive. When M\'Namara returned\r\nto London, and reported the prince\'s answer to the gentlemen who had\r\nemployed him, they were astonished and confounded. However, they soon\r\nresolved on the measures which they were to pursue for the future, and\r\ndetermined no longer to serve a man who could not be persuaded to serve\r\nhimself, and chose rather to endanger the lives of his best and most\r\nfaithful friends, than part with an harlot, whom, as he often declared,\r\nhe neither loved nor esteemed.\'\r\n\r\nFrom this anecdote, the general truth of which is indubitable, the\r\nprincipal fault of Charles Edward\'s temper is sufficiently obvious. It\r\nwas a high sense of his own importance, and an obstinate adherence to\r\nwhat he had once determined on--qualities which, if he had succeeded in\r\nhis bold attempt, gave the nation little room to hope that he would have\r\nbeen found free from the love of prerogative and desire of arbitrary\r\npower, which characterized his unhappy grandfather. He gave a notable\r\ninstance how far this was the leading feature of his character, when,\r\nfor no reasonable cause that can be assigned, he placed his own single\r\nwill in opposition to the necessities of France, which, in order to\r\npurchase a peace become necessary to the kingdom, was reduced to gratify\r\nBritain by prohibiting the residence of Charles within any part of the\r\nFrench dominions. It was in vain that France endeavoured to lessen the\r\ndisgrace of this step by making the most flattering offers, in hopes\r\nto induce the prince of himself to anticipate this disagreeable\r\nalternative, which, if seriously enforced, as it was likely to be, he\r\nhad no means whatever of resisting, by leaving the kingdom as of his\r\nown free will. Inspired, however, by the spirit of hereditary obstinacy,\r\nCharles preferred a useless resistance to a dignified submission, and,\r\nby a series of idle bravadoes, laid the French court under the necessity\r\nof arresting their late ally, and sending him to close confinement\r\nin the Bastille, from which he was afterwards sent out of the French\r\ndominions, much in the manner in which a convict is transported to the\r\nplace of his destination.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these repeated instances of a rash and inflexible temper,\r\nDr. King also adds faults alleged to belong to the prince\'s character,\r\nof a kind less consonant with his noble birth and high pretensions.\r\nHe is said by this author to have been avaricious, or parsimonious at\r\nleast, to such a degree of meanness, as to fail, even when he had\r\nample means, in relieving the sufferers who had lost their fortune, and\r\nsacrificed all in his ill-fated attempt. [The approach is thus expressed\r\nby Dr. King, who brings the charge:--\'But the most odious part of his\r\ncharacter is his love of money, a vice which I do not remember to have\r\nbeen imputed by our historians to any of his ancestors, and is the\r\ncertain index of a base and little mind. I know it may be urged in his\r\nvindication, that a prince in exile ought to be an economist. And so\r\nhe ought; but, nevertheless, his purse should be always open as long as\r\nthere is anything in it, to relieve the necessities of his friends and\r\nadherents. King Charles II, during his banishment, would have shared the\r\nlast pistole in his pocket with his little family. But I have known this\r\ngentleman, with two thousand louis-d\'ors in his strong-box, pretend he\r\nwas in great distress, and borrow money from a lady in Paris who was not\r\nin affluent circumstances. His most faithful servants, who had closely\r\nattended him in all his difficulties, were ill rewarded.\'--King\'s\r\nMEMOIRS.] We must receive, however, with some degree of jealousy what\r\nis said by Dr. King on this subject, recollecting that he had left at\r\nleast, if he did not desert, the standard of the unfortunate prince, and\r\nwas not therefore a person who was likely to form the fairest estimate\r\nof his virtues and faults. We must also remember that if the exiled\r\nprince gave little, he had but little to give, especially considering\r\nhow late he nourished the scheme of another expedition to Scotland, for\r\nwhich he was long endeavouring to hoard money.\r\n\r\nThe case, also, of Charles Edward must be allowed to have been a\r\ndifficult one. He had to satisfy numerous persons, who, having lost\r\ntheir all in his cause, had, with that all, seen the extinction of hopes\r\nwhich they accounted nearly as good as certainties; some of these were\r\nperhaps clamorous in their applications, and certainly ill pleased with\r\ntheir want of success. Other parts of the Chevalier\'s conduct may have\r\nafforded grounds for charging him with coldness to the sufferings of his\r\ndevoted followers. One of these was a sentiment which has nothing in it\r\nthat is generous, but it was certainly a principle in which the young\r\nprince was trained, and which may be too probably denominated peculiar\r\nto his family, educated in all the high notions of passive obedience\r\nand non-resistance. If the unhappy prince gave implicit faith to the\r\nprofessions of statesmen holding such notions, which is implied by his\r\nwhole conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREDGAUNTLET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I\r\n\r\nDARSIE LATIMER TO ALAN FAIRFORD\r\n\r\nDUMFRIES.\r\n\r\nCUR ME EXANIMAS QUERELIS TUIS? In plain English, Why do you deafen me\r\nwith your croaking? The disconsolate tone in which you bade me farewell\r\nat Noble House, [The first stage on the road from Edinburgh to Dumfries\r\nvia Moffat.] and mounted your miserable hack to return to your law\r\ndrudgery, still sounds in my ears. It seemed to say, \'Happy dog! you can\r\nramble at pleasure over hill and dale, pursue every object of curiosity\r\nthat presents itself, and relinquish the chase when it loses interest;\r\nwhile I, your senior and your better, must, in this brilliant season,\r\nreturn to my narrow chamber and my musty books.\'\r\n\r\nSuch was the import of the reflections with which you saddened our\r\nparting bottle of claret, and thus I must needs interpret the terms of\r\nyour melancholy adieu.\r\n\r\nAnd why should this be so, Alan? Why the deuce should you not be sitting\r\nprecisely opposite to me at this moment, in the same comfortable George\r\nInn; thy heels on the fender, and thy juridical brow expanding its\r\nplications as a pun rose in your fancy? Above all, why, when I fill this\r\nvery glass of wine, cannot I push the bottle to you, and say, \'Fairford,\r\nyou are chased!\' Why, I say, should not all this be, except because Alan\r\nFairford has not the same true sense of friendship as Darsie Latimer,\r\nand will not regard our purses as common, as well as our sentiments?\r\n\r\nI am alone in the world; my only guardian writes to me of a large\r\nfortune which will be mine when I reach the age of twenty-five complete;\r\nmy present income is, thou knowest, more than sufficient for all\r\nmy wants; and yet thou--traitor as thou art to the cause of\r\nfriendship--dost deprive me of the pleasure of thy society, and\r\nsubmittest, besides, to self-denial on thine own part, rather than my\r\nwanderings should cost me a few guineas more! Is this regard for\r\nmy purse, or for thine own pride? Is it not equally absurd and\r\nunreasonable, whichever source it springs from? For myself, I tell thee,\r\nI have, and shall have, more than enough for both. This same methodical\r\nSamuel Griffiths, of Ironmonger Lane, Guildhall, London, whose letter\r\narrives as duly as quarter-day, has sent me, as I told thee, double\r\nallowance for this my twenty-first birthday, and an assurance, in his\r\nbrief fashion, that it will be again doubled for the succeeding years,\r\nuntil I enter into possession of my own property. Still I am to refrain\r\nfrom visiting England until my twenty-fifth year expires; and it is\r\nrecommended that I shall forbear all inquiries concerning my family, and\r\nso forth, for the present.\r\n\r\nWere it not that I recollect my poor mother in her deep widow\'s weeds,\r\nwith a countenance that never smiled but when she looked on me--and\r\nthen, in such wan and woful sort, as the sun when he glances through an\r\nApril cloud,--were it not, I say, that her mild and matron-like form\r\nand countenance forbid such a suspicion, I might think myself the son of\r\nsome Indian director, or rich citizen, who had more wealth than grace,\r\nand a handful of hypocrisy to boot, and who was breeding up privately,\r\nand obscurely enriching, one of whose existence he had some reason to be\r\nashamed. But, as I said before, I think on my mother, and am convinced\r\nas much as of the existence of my own soul, that no touch of shame could\r\narise from aught in which she was implicated. Meantime, I am wealthy,\r\nand I am alone, and why does my friend scruple to share my wealth?\r\n\r\nAre you not my only friend? and have you not acquired a right to share\r\nmy wealth? Answer me that, Alan Fairford. When I was brought from the\r\nsolitude of my mother\'s dwelling into the tumult of the Gaits\' Class at\r\nthe High School--when I was mocked for my English accent--salted with\r\nsnow as a Southern--rolled in the gutter for a Saxon pock-pudding,--who,\r\nwith stout arguments and stouter blows, stood forth my defender?--why,\r\nAlan Fairford. Who beat me soundly when I brought the arrogance of an\r\nonly son, and of course a spoiled urchin, to the forms of the little\r\nrepublic?--why, Alan. And who taught me to smoke a cobbler, pin a losen,\r\nhead a bicker, and hold the bannets?--[Break a window, head a skirmish\r\nwith stones, and hold the bonnet, or handkerchief, which used to divide\r\nHigh School boys when fighting.] Alan, once more. If I became the pride\r\nof the Yards, and the dread of the hucksters in the High School Wynd,\r\nit was under thy patronage; and, but for thee, I had been contented with\r\nhumbly passing through the Cowgate Port, without climbing over the\r\ntop of it, and had never seen the KITTLE NINE-STEPS nearer than from\r\nBareford\'s Parks. [A pass on the very brink of the Castle rock to the\r\nnorth, by which it is just possible for a goat, or a High School boy,\r\nto turn the corner of the building where it rises from the edge of the\r\nprecipice. This was so favourite a feat with the \'hell and neck boys\'\r\nof the higher classes, that at one time sentinels were posted to prevent\r\nits repetition. One of the nine-steps was rendered more secure because\r\nthe climber could take hold of the root of a nettle, so precarious were\r\nthe means of passing this celebrated spot. The manning the Cowgate Port,\r\nespecially in snowball time, was also a choice amusement, as it offered\r\nan inaccessible station for the boys who used these missiles to the\r\nannoyance of the passengers. The gateway is now demolished; and probably\r\nmost of its garrison lie as low as the fortress. To recollect that\r\nthe author himself, however naturally disqualified, was one of those\r\njuvenile dreadnoughts, is a sad reflection to one who cannot now step\r\nover a brook without assistance.]\r\n\r\nYou taught me to keep my fingers off the weak, and to clench my fist\r\nagainst the strong--to carry no tales out of school--to stand forth like\r\na true man--obey the stern order of a PANDE MANUM, and endure my pawmies\r\nwithout wincing, like one that is determined not to be the better for\r\nthem. In a word, before I knew thee, I knew nothing.\r\n\r\nAt college it was the same. When I was incorrigibly idle, your example\r\nand encouragement roused me to mental exertion, and showed me the way\r\nto intellectual enjoyment. You made me an historian, a metaphysician\r\n(INVITA MINERVA)--nay, by Heaven! you had almost made an advocate of me,\r\nas well as of yourself. Yes, rather than part with you, Alan, I attended\r\na weary season at the Scotch Law Class; a wearier at the Civil; and with\r\nwhat excellent advantage, my notebook, filled with caricatures of the\r\nprofessors and my fellow students, is it not yet extant to testify?\r\n\r\n   Thus far have I held on with thee untired;\r\n\r\nand, to say truth, purely and solely that I might travel the same road\r\nwith thee. But it will not do, Alan. By my faith, man, I could as soon\r\nthink of being one of those ingenious traders who cheat little Master\r\nJackies on the outside of the partition with tops, balls, bats, and\r\nbattledores, as a member of the long-robed fraternity within, who impose\r\non grown country gentlemen with bouncing brocards of law. [The Hall of\r\nthe Parliament House of Edinburgh was, in former days, divided into two\r\nunequal portions by a partition, the inner side of which was consecrated\r\nto the use of the Courts of Justice and the gentlemen of the law; while\r\nthe outer division was occupied by the stalls of stationers, toymen, and\r\nthe like, as in a modern bazaar. From the old play of THE PLAIN DEALER,\r\nit seems such was formerly the case with Westminster Hall. Minos has now\r\npurified his courts in both cities from all traffic but his own.]\r\nNow, don\'t you read this to your worthy father, Alan--he loves me well\r\nenough, I know, of a Saturday night; but he thinks me but idle company\r\nfor any other day of the week. And here, I suspect, lies your real\r\nobjection to taking a ramble with me through the southern counties in\r\nthis delicious weather. I know the good gentleman has hard thoughts\r\nof me for being so unsettled as to leave Edinburgh before the Session\r\nrises; perhaps, too, he quarrels a little--I will not say with my want\r\nof ancestry, but with my want of connexions. He reckons me a lone thing\r\nin this world, Alan, and so, in good truth, I am; and it seems a reason\r\nto him why you should not attach yourself to me, that I can claim no\r\ninterest in the general herd.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose I forget what I owe him, for permitting me to shelter for\r\nfour years under his roof: My obligations to him are not the less, but\r\nthe greater, if he never heartily loved me. He is angry, too, that I\r\nwill not, or cannot, be a lawyer, and, with reference to you, considers\r\nmy disinclination that way as PESSIMI EXEMPLI, as he might say.\r\n\r\nBut he need not be afraid that a lad of your steadiness will be\r\ninfluenced by such a reed shaken by the winds as I am. You will go on\r\ndoubting with Dirleton, and resolving those doubts with Stewart,\r\n[\'Sir John Nisbett of Dirleton\'s DOUBTS AND QUESTIONS UPON THE LAW,\r\nESPECIALLLY OF SCOTLAND;\' and \'Sir James Stewart\'s DIRLETON\'S DOUBTS AND\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE LAW OF SCOTLAND RESOLVED AND ANSWERED,\' are works\r\nof authority in Scottish jurisprudence. As is generally the case, the\r\ndoubts are held more in respect than the solution.] until the cramp\r\nspeech [Till of late years, every advocate who catered at the Scottish\r\nbar made a Latin address to the Court, faculty, and audience, in set\r\nterms, and said a few words upon a text of the civil law, to show his\r\nLatinity and jurisprudence. He also wore his hat for a minute, in order\r\nto vindicate his right of being covered before the Court, which is said\r\nto have originated from the celebrated lawyer, Sir Thomas Hope, having\r\ntwo sons on the bench while he himself remained at the bar. Of late this\r\nceremony has been dispensed with, as occupying the time of the Court\r\nunnecessarily. The entrant lawyer merely takes the oaths to government,\r\nand swears to maintain the rules and privileges of his order.] has\r\nbeen spoken more SOLITO from the corner of the bench, and with covered\r\nhead--until you have sworn to defend the liberties and privileges of the\r\nCollege of Justice--until the black gown is hung on your shoulders, and\r\nyou are free as any of the Faculty to sue or defend. Then will I step\r\nforth, Alan, and in a character which even your father will allow may be\r\nmore useful to you than had I shared this splendid termination of your\r\nlegal studies. In a word, if I cannot be a counsel, I am determined to\r\nbe a CLIENT, a sort of person without whom a lawsuit would be as dull\r\nas a supposed case. Yes, I am determined to give you your first fee. One\r\ncan easily, I am assured, get into a lawsuit--it is only the getting out\r\nwhich is sometimes found troublesome;--and, with your kind father for\r\nan agent, and you for my counsel learned in the law, and the worshipful\r\nMaster Samuel Griffiths to back me, a few sessions shall not tire my\r\npatience. In short, I will make my way into court, even if it should\r\ncost me the committing a DELICT, or at least a QUASI DELICT.--You see\r\nall is not lost of what Erskine wrote, and Wallace taught.\r\n\r\nThus far I have fooled it off well enough; and yet, Alan, all is not\r\nat ease within me. I am affected with a sense of loneliness, the more\r\ndepressing, that it seems to me to be a solitude peculiarly my own. In a\r\ncountry where all the world have a circle of consanguinity, extending to\r\nsixth cousins at least, I am a solitary individual, having only one kind\r\nheart to throb in unison with my own. If I were condemned to labour\r\nfor my bread, methinks I should less regard this peculiar species of\r\ndeprivation, The necessary communication of master and servant would be\r\nat least a tie which would attach me to the rest of my kind--as it is,\r\nmy very independence seems to enhance the peculiarity of my situation.\r\nI am in the world as a stranger in the crowded coffeehouse, where he\r\nenters, calls for what refreshment he wants, pays his bill, and is\r\nforgotten so soon as the waiter\'s mouth has pronounced his \'Thank ye,\r\nsir.\'\r\n\r\nI know your good father would term this SINNING MY MERCIES, [A\r\npeculiar Scottish phrase expressive of ingratitude for the favours of\r\nProvidence.] and ask how I should feel if, instead of being able to\r\nthrow down my reckoning, I were obliged to deprecate the resentment of\r\nthe landlord for consuming that which I could not pay for. I cannot tell\r\nhow it is; but, though this very reasonable reflection comes across me,\r\nand though I do confess that four hundred a year in possession, eight\r\nhundred in near prospect, and the L--d knows how many hundreds more in\r\nthe distance, are very pretty and comfortable things, yet I would freely\r\ngive one half of them to call your father father, though he should\r\nscold me for my idleness every hour of the day, and to call you brother,\r\nthough a brother whose merits would throw my own so completely into the\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nThe faint, yet not improbable, belief has often come across me, that\r\nyour father knows something more about my birth and condition than he\r\nis willing to communicate; it is so unlikely that I should be left in\r\nEdinburgh at six years old, without any other recommendation than\r\nthe regular payment of my board to old M--, [Probably Mathieson,\r\nthe predecessor of Dr. Adams, to whose memory the author and his\r\ncontemporaries owe a deep debt of gratitude.] of the High School.\r\nBefore that time, as I have often told you, I have but a recollection\r\nof unbounded indulgence on my mother\'s part, and the most tyrannical\r\nexertion of caprice on my own. I remember still how bitterly she\r\nsighed, how vainly she strove to soothe me, while, in the full energy\r\nof despotism, I roared like ten bull-calves, for something which it was\r\nimpossible to procure for me. She is dead, that kind, that ill-rewarded\r\nmother! I remember the long faces--the darkened rooms--the black\r\nhangings--the mysterious impression made upon my mind by the hearse and\r\nmourning coaches, and the difficulty which I had to reconcile all this\r\nto the disappearance of my mother. I do not think I had before this\r\nevent formed, any idea, of death, or that I had even heard of that final\r\nconsummation of all that lives. The first acquaintance which I formed\r\nwith it deprived me of my only relation.\r\n\r\nA clergyman of venerable appearance, our only visitor, was my guide\r\nand companion in a journey of considerable length; and in the charge of\r\nanother elderly man, substituted in his place, I know not how or why, I\r\ncompleted my journey to Scotland--and this is all I recollect.\r\n\r\nI repeat the little history now, as I have a hundred times before,\r\nmerely because I would wring some sense out of it. Turn, then, thy\r\nsharp, wire-drawing, lawyer-like ingenuity to the same task--make up my\r\nhistory as though thou wert shaping the blundering allegations of some\r\nblue-bonneted, hard-headed client, into a condescendence of facts\r\nand circumstances, and thou shalt be, not my Apollo--QUID TIBI CUM\r\nLYRA?--but my Lord Stair, [Celebrated as a Scottish lawyer.] Meanwhile,\r\nI have written myself out of my melancholy and blue devils, merely by\r\nprosing about them; so I will now converse half an hour with Roan Robin\r\nin his stall--the rascal knows me already, and snickers whenever I cross\r\nthe threshold of the stable.\r\n\r\nThe black which you bestrode yesterday morning promises to be an\r\nadmirable roadster, and ambled as easily with Sam and the portmanteau,\r\nas with you and your load of law-learning. Sam promises to be steady,\r\nand has hitherto been so. No long trial, you will say. He lays the\r\nblame of former inaccuracies on evil company--the people who were at the\r\nlivery-stable were too seductive, I suppose--he denies he ever did the\r\nhorse injustice--would rather have wanted his own dinner, he says.\r\nIn this I believe him, as Roan Robin\'s ribs and coat show no marks of\r\ncontradiction. However, as he will meet with no saints in the inns we\r\nfrequent, and as oats are sometimes as speedily converted into ale\r\nas John Barleycorn himself, I shall keep a look-out after Master Sam.\r\nStupid fellow! had he not abused my good nature, I might have chatted\r\nto him to keep my tongue in exercise; whereas now I must keep him at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nDo you remember what Mr. Fairford said to me on this subject--it did not\r\nbecome my father\'s son to speak in that manner to Sam\'s father\'s son?\r\nI asked you what your father could possibly know of mine; and you\r\nanswered, \'As much, you supposed, as he knew of Sam\'s--it was a\r\nproverbial expression.\' This did not quite satisfy me; though I am sure\r\nI cannot tell why it should not. But I am returning to a fruitless\r\nand exhausted subject. Do not be afraid that I shall come back on\r\nthis well-trodden yet pathless field of conjecture. I know nothing so\r\nuseless, so utterly feeble and contemptible, as the groaning forth one\'s\r\nlamentations into the ears of our friends.\r\n\r\nI would fain promise you that my letters shall be as entertaining as\r\nI am determined they shall be regular and well filled. We have an\r\nadvantage over the dear friends of old, every pair of them.\r\nNeither David and Jonathan, nor Orestes and Pylades, nor Damon and\r\nPythias--although, in the latter case particularly, a letter by post\r\nwould have been very acceptable--ever corresponded together; for they\r\nprobably could not write, and certainly had neither post nor franks to\r\nspeed their effusions to each other; whereas yours, which you had from\r\nthe old peer, being handled gently, and opened with precaution, may be\r\nreturned to me again, and serve to make us free of his Majesty\'s post\r\noffice, during the whole time of my proposed tour. [It is well known\r\nand remembered, that when Members of Parliament enjoyed the unlimited\r\nprivilege of franking by the mere writing the name on the cover, it was\r\nextended to the most extraordinary occasions. One noble lord, to express\r\nhis regard for a particular regiment, franked a letter for every rank\r\nand file. It was customary also to save the covers and return them,\r\nin order that the correspondence might be carried on as long as the\r\nenvelopes could hold together.] Mercy upon us, Alan! what letters I\r\nshall have to send to you, with an account of all that I can collect, of\r\npleasant or rare, in this wild-goose jaunt of mine! All I stipulate is\r\nthat you do not communicate them to the SCOTS MAGAZINE; for though you\r\nused, in a left-handed way, to compliment me on my attainments in the\r\nlighter branches of literature, at the expense of my deficiency in the\r\nweightier matters of the law, I am not yet audacious enough to enter the\r\nportal which the learned Ruddiman so kindly opened for the acolytes of\r\nthe Muses.--VALE SIS MEMOR MEI. D. L.\r\n\r\nPS. Direct to the Post Office here. I shall leave orders to forward your\r\nletters wherever I may travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II\r\n\r\nALAN FAIRFORD TO DARSIE LATIMER\r\n\r\nNEGATUR, my dear Darsie--you have logic and law enough to understand the\r\nword of denial. I deny your conclusion. The premises I admit, namely,\r\nthat when I mounted on that infernal hack, I might utter what seemed\r\na sigh, although I deemed it lost amid the puffs and groans of the\r\nbroken-winded brute, matchless in the complication of her complaints by\r\nany save she, the poor man\'s mare, renowned in song, that died\r\n\r\n  A mile aboon Dundee.\r\n\r\n [Alluding, as all Scotsmen know, to the humorous old song:--\r\n\r\n \'The auld man\'s mare\'s dead,\r\n  The puir man\'s mare\'s dead,\r\n  The auld man\'s mare\'s dead,\r\n  A mile aboon Dundee.\']\r\n\r\nBut credit me, Darsie, the sigh which escaped me, concerned thee more\r\nthan myself, and regarded neither the superior mettle of your cavalry,\r\nnor your greater command of the means of travelling. I could certainly\r\nhave cheerfully ridden with you for a few days; and assure yourself I\r\nwould not have hesitated to tax your better filled purse for our joint\r\nexpenses. But you know my father considers every moment taken from the\r\nlaw as a step down hill; and I owe much to his anxiety on my account,\r\nalthough its effects are sometimes troublesome. For example:\r\n\r\nI found, on my arrival at the shop in Brown\'s Square, that the old\r\ngentleman had returned that very evening, impatient, it seems, of\r\nremaining a night out of the guardianship of the domestic Lares. Having\r\nthis information from James, whose brow wore rather an anxious look on\r\nthe occasion, I dispatched a Highland chairman to the livery stable with\r\nmy Bucephalus, and slunk, with as little noise as might be, into my own\r\nden, where I began to mumble certain half-gnawed and not half-digested\r\ndoctrines of our municipal code. I was not long seated, when my father\'s\r\nvisage was thrust, in a peering sort of way, through the half-opened\r\ndoor; and withdrawn, on seeing my occupation, with a half-articulated\r\nHUMPH! which seemed to convey a doubt of the seriousness of my\r\napplication. If it were so, I cannot condemn him; for recollection of\r\nthee occupied me so entirely during an hour\'s reading, that although\r\nStair lay before me, and notwithstanding that I turned over three or\r\nfour pages, the sense of his lordship\'s clear and perspicuous style\r\nso far escaped me, that I had the mortification to find my labour was\r\nutterly in vain.\r\n\r\nEre I had brought up my lee-way, James appeared with his summons to our\r\nfrugal supper--radishes, cheese, and a bottle of the old ale-only two\r\nplates though--and no chair set for Mr. Darsie, by the attentive James\r\nWilkinson. Said James, with his long face, lank hair, and very long\r\npig-tail in its leathern strap, was placed, as usual, at the back of\r\nmy father\'s chair, upright as a wooden sentinel at the door of a\r\npuppet-show. \'You may go down, James,\' said my father; and exit\r\nWilkinson.--What is to come next? thought I; for the weather is not\r\nclear on the paternal brow.\r\n\r\nMy boots encountered his first glance of displeasure, and he asked me,\r\nwith a sneer, which way I had been riding. He expected me to answer,\r\n\'Nowhere,\' and would then have been at me with his usual sarcasm,\r\ntouching the humour of walking in shoes at twenty shillings a pair. But\r\nI answered with composure, that I had ridden out to dinner as far as\r\nNoble House. He started (you know his way) as if I had said that I\r\nhad dined at Jericho; and as I did not choose to seem to observe his\r\nsurprise, but continued munching my radishes in tranquillity, he broke\r\nforth in ire.\r\n\r\n\'To Noble House, sir! and what had you to do at Noble House, sir? Do\r\nyou remember you are studying law, sir?--that your Scots law trials are\r\ncoming on, sir?--that every moment of your time just now is worth hours\r\nat another time?--and have you leisure to go to Noble House, sir?--and\r\nto throw your books behind you for so many hours?--Had it been a turn in\r\nthe meadows, or even a game at golf--but Noble House, sir!\'\r\n\r\n\'I went so far with Darsie Latimer, sir, to see him begin his journey.\'\r\n\r\n\'Darsie Latimer?\' he replied in a softened tone--\'Humph!--Well, I do not\r\nblame you for being kind to Darsie Latimer; but it would have done as\r\nmuch good if you had walked with him as far as the toll-bar, and then\r\nmade your farewells--it would have saved horse-hire--and your reckoning,\r\ntoo, at dinner.\'\r\n\r\n\'Latimer paid that, sir,\' I replied, thinking to soften the matter; but\r\nI had much better have left it unspoken.\r\n\r\n\'The reckoning, sir!\' replied my father. \'And did you sponge upon any\r\nman for a reckoning? Sir, no man should enter the door of a public-house\r\nwithout paying his lawing.\'\r\n\r\n\'I admit the general rule, sir,\' I replied; \'but this was a parting-cup\r\nbetween Darsie and me; and I should conceive it fell under the exception\r\nof DOCH AN DORROCH.\'\r\n\r\n\'You think yourself a wit,\' said my father, with as near an approach to\r\na smile as ever he permits to gild the solemnity of his features; \'but\r\nI reckon you did not eat your dinner standing, like the Jews at their\r\nPassover? and it was decided in a case before the town-bailies of\r\nCupar-Angus, when Luckie Simpson\'s cow had drunk up Luckie Jamieson\'s\r\nbrowst of ale while it stood in the door to cool, that there was no\r\ndamage to pay, because the crummie drank without sitting down; such\r\nbeing the very circumstance constituting DOCH AN DORROCH, which is a\r\nstanding drink, for which no reckoning is paid. Ha, sir! what says your\r\nadvocateship (FIERI) to that? EXEPTIO FIRMAT REGULAM--But come, fill\r\nyour glass, Alan; I am not sorry ye have shown this attention to Darsie\r\nLatimer, who is a good lad, as times go; and having now lived under my\r\nroof since he left the school, why, there is really no great matter in\r\ncoming under this small obligation to him.\'\r\n\r\nAs I saw my father\'s scruples were much softened by the consciousness of\r\nhis superiority in the legal argument, I took care to accept my pardon\r\nas a matter of grace, rather than of justice; and only replied, we\r\nshould feel ourselves duller of an evening, now that you were absent. I\r\nwill give you my father\'s exact words in reply, Darsie. You know him so\r\nwell, that they will not offend you; and you are also aware, that there\r\nmingles with the good man\'s preciseness and formality, a fund of shrewd\r\nobservation and practical good sense.\r\n\r\n\'It is very true,\' he said; \'Darsie was a pleasant companion-but over\r\nwaggish, over waggish, Alan, and somewhat scatter-brained.--By the way,\r\nWilkinson must get our ale bottled in English pints now, for a quart\r\nbottle is too much, night after night, for you and me, without his\r\nassistance.--But Darsie, as I was saying, is an arch lad, and somewhat\r\nlight in the upper story--I wish him well through the world; but he has\r\nlittle solidity, Alan, little solidity.\'\r\n\r\nI scorn to desert an absent friend, Darsie, so I said for you a little\r\nmore than my conscience warranted: but your defection from your legal\r\nstudies had driven you far to leeward in my father\'s good opinion.\r\n\r\n\'Unstable as water, he shall not excel,\' said my father; \'or, as the\r\nSeptuagint hath it, EFUSA EST SICUT AQUA--NON CRESCAT. He goeth to\r\ndancing-houses, and readeth novels--SAT EST.\'\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to parry these texts by observing, that the dancing-houses\r\namounted only to one night at La Pique\'s ball--the novels (so far as\r\nmatter of notoriety, Darsie) to an odd volume of TOM JONES.\r\n\r\n\'But he danced from night to morning,\' replied my father, \'and he read\r\nthe idle trash, which the author should have been scourged for, at least\r\ntwenty times over. It was never out of his hand.\'\r\n\r\nI then hinted, that in all probability your fortune was now so easy as\r\nto dispense with your prosecuting the law any further than you had done;\r\nand therefore you might think you had some title to amuse yourself. This\r\nwas the least palatable argument of all.\r\n\r\n\'If he cannot amuse himself with the law,\' said my father, snappishly\r\n\'it is the worse for him. If he needs not law to teach him to make a\r\nfortune, I am sure he needs it to teach him how to keep one; and it\r\nwould better become him to be learning this, than to be scouring the\r\ncountry like a land-louper, going he knows not where, to see he knows\r\nnot what, and giving treats at Noble House to fools like himself\' (an\r\nangry glance at poor me), \'Noble House, indeed!\' he repeated, with\r\nelevated voice and sneering tone, as if there were something offensive\r\nto him in the name, though I will venture to say that any place in which\r\nyou had been extravagant enough to spend five shillings, would have\r\nstood as deep in his reprobation.\r\n\r\nMindful of your idea, that my father knows more of your real situation\r\nthan he thinks proper to mention, I thought I would hazard a fishing\r\nobservation. \'I did not see,\' I said, \'how the Scottish law would be\r\nuseful to a young gentleman whose fortune would seem to be vested in\r\nEngland.\'--I really thought my father would have beat me.\r\n\r\n\'D\'ye mean to come round me, sir, PER AMBAGES, as Counsellor Pest says?\r\nWhat is it to you where Darsie Latimer\'s fortune is vested, or whether\r\nhe hath any fortune, aye or no? And what ill would the Scottish law do\r\nto him, though he had as much of it as either Stair or Bankton, sir? Is\r\nnot the foundation of our municipal law the ancient code of the Roman\r\nEmpire, devised at a time when it was so much renowned for its civil\r\npolity, sir, and wisdom? Go to your bed, sir, after your expedition to\r\nNoble House, and see that your lamp be burning and your book before you\r\nere the sun peeps. ARS LONGA, VITA BREVIS--were it not a sin to call the\r\ndivine science of the law by the inferior name of art.\'\r\n\r\nSo my lamp did burn, dear Darsie, the next morning, though the owner\r\ntook the risk of a domiciliary visitation, and lay snug in bed, trusting\r\nits glimmer might, without further inquiry, be received as sufficient\r\nevidence of his vigilance. And now, upon this the third morning after\r\nyour departure, things are but little better; for though the lamp burns\r\nin my den, and VOET ON THE PANDECTS hath his wisdom spread open before\r\nme, yet as I only use him as a reading-desk on which to scribble this\r\nsheet of nonsense to Darsie Latimer, it is probable the vicinity will be\r\nof little furtherance to my studies.\r\n\r\nAnd now, methinks, I hear thee call me an affected hypocritical varlet,\r\nwho, living under such a system of distrust and restraint as my father\r\nchooses to govern by, nevertheless pretends not to envy you your freedom\r\nand independence.\r\n\r\nLatimer, I will tell you no lies. I wish my father would allow me a\r\nlittle more exercise of my free will, were it but that I might feel the\r\npleasure of doing what would please him of my own accord. A little more\r\nspare time, and a little more money to enjoy it, would, besides, neither\r\nmisbecome my age nor my condition; and it is, I own, provoking to see so\r\nmany in the same situation winging the air at freedom, while I sit here,\r\ncaged up like a cobbler\'s linnet, to chant the same unvaried lesson\r\nfrom sunrise to sunset, not to mention the listening to so many lectures\r\nagainst idleness, as if I enjoyed or was making use of the means of\r\namusement! But then I cannot at heart blame either the motive or the\r\nobject of this severity. For the motive, it is and can only be my\r\nfather\'s anxious, devoted, and unremitting affection and zeal for my\r\nimprovement, with a laudable sense of the honour of the profession to\r\nwhich he has trained me.\r\n\r\nAs we have no near relations, the tie betwixt us is of even unusual\r\ncloseness, though in itself one of the strongest which nature can form.\r\nI am, and have all along been, the exclusive object of my father\'s\r\nanxious hopes, and his still more anxious and engrossing fears; so what\r\ntitle have I to complain, although now and then these fears and hopes\r\nlead him to take a troublesome and incessant charge of all my motions?\r\nBesides, I ought to recollect, and, Darsie, I do recollect, that my\r\nfather upon various occasions, has shown that he can be indulgent as\r\nwell as strict. The leaving his old apartments in the Luckenbooths was\r\nto him like divorcing the soul from the body; yet Dr. R---- did but\r\nhint that the better air of this new district was more favourable to\r\nmy health, as I was then suffering under the penalties of too rapid a\r\ngrowth, when he exchanged his old and beloved quarters, adjacent to the\r\nvery Heart of Midlothian, for one of those new tenements (entire within\r\nthemselves) which modern taste has so lately introduced. Instance also\r\nthe inestimable favour which he conferred on me by receiving you into\r\nhis house, when you had only the unpleasant alternative of remaining,\r\nthough a grown-up lad, in the society of mere boys. [The diminutive and\r\nobscure place called Brown\'s Square, was hailed about the time of its\r\nerection as an extremely elegant improvement upon the style of designing\r\nand erecting Edinburgh residences. Each house was, in the phrase used\r\nby appraisers, \'finished within itself,\' or, in the still newer\r\nphraseology, \'self-contained.\' It was built about the year 1763-4; and\r\nthe old part of the city being near and accessible, this square soon\r\nreceived many inhabitants, who ventured to remove to so moderate a\r\ndistance from the High Street.] This was a thing so contrary to all my\r\nfather\'s ideas of seclusion, of economy, and of the safety to my morals\r\nand industry, which he wished to attain, by preserving me from the\r\nsociety of other young people, that, upon my word, I am always rather\r\nastonished how I should have had the impudence to make the request, than\r\nthat he should have complied with it.\r\n\r\nThen for the object of his solicitude--Do not laugh, or hold up your\r\nhands, my good Darsie; but upon my word I like the profession to which\r\nI am in the course of being educated, and am serious in prosecuting the\r\npreliminary studies. The law is my vocation--in an especial, and, I\r\nmay say, in an hereditary way, my vocation; for although I have not the\r\nhonour to belong to any of the great families who form in Scotland, as\r\nin France, the noblesse of the robe, and with us, at least, carry their\r\nheads as high, or rather higher, than the noblesse of the sword,--for\r\nthe former consist more frequently of the \'first-born of Egypt,\'--yet\r\nmy grandfather, who, I dare say, was a most excellent person, had the\r\nhonour to sign a bitter protest against the Union, in the respectable\r\ncharacter of town-clerk to the ancient Borough of Birlthegroat; and\r\nthere is some reason--shall I say to hope, or to suspect?--that he may\r\nhave been a natural son of a first cousin of the then Fairford of that\r\nIlk, who had been long numbered among the minor barons. Now my father\r\nmounted a step higher on the ladder of legal promotion, being, as you\r\nknow as well as I do, an eminent and respected Writer to his Majesty\'s\r\nSignet; and I myself am destined to mount a round higher still, and wear\r\nthe honoured robe which is sometimes supposed, like Charity, to cover\r\na multitude of sins. I have, therefore, no choice but to climb upwards;\r\nsince we have mounted thus high, or else to fall down at the imminent\r\nrisk of my neck. So that I reconcile myself to my destiny; and while\r\nyou, are looking from mountain peaks, at distant lakes and firths, I am,\r\nDE APICIBUS JURIS, consoling myself with visions of crimson and scarlet\r\ngowns--with the appendages of handsome cowls, well lined with salary.\r\n\r\nYou smile, Darsie, MORE TUO, and seem to say it is little worth while to\r\ncozen one\'s self with such vulgar dreams; yours being, on the contrary,\r\nof a high and heroic character, bearing the same resemblance to mine,\r\nthat a bench, covered with purple cloth and plentifully loaded with\r\nsession papers, does to some Gothic throne, rough with barbaric pearl\r\nand gold. But what would you have?--SUA QUEMQUE TRAHIT VOLUPTAS. And my\r\nvisions of preferment, though they may be as unsubstantial at present,\r\nare nevertheless more capable of being realized, than your aspirations\r\nafter the Lord knows what. What says my father\'s proverb? \'Look to a\r\ngown of gold, and you will at least get a sleeve of it.\' Such is my\r\npursuit; but what dost thou look to? The chance that the mystery, as\r\nyou call it, which at present overclouds your birth and connexions, will\r\nclear up into something inexpressibly and inconceivably brilliant;\r\nand this without any effort or exertion of your own, but purely by the\r\ngoodwill of Fortune. I know the pride and naughtiness of thy heart, and\r\nsincerely do I wish that thou hadst more beatings to thank me for, than\r\nthose which thou dost acknowledge so gratefully. Then had I thumped\r\nthese Quixotical expectations out of thee, and thou hadst not, as\r\nnow, conceived thyself to be the hero of some romantic history, and\r\nconverted, in thy vain imaginations, honest Griffiths, citizen and\r\nbroker, who never bestows more than the needful upon his quarterly\r\nepistles, into some wise Alexander or sage Alquife, the mystical and\r\nmagical protector of thy peerless destiny. But I know not how it was,\r\nthy skull got harder, I think, and my knuckles became softer; not to\r\nmention that at length thou didst begin to show about thee a spark of\r\nsomething dangerous, which I was bound to respect at least, if I did not\r\nfear it.\r\n\r\nAnd while I speak of this, it is not much amiss to advise thee to\r\ncorrect a little this cock-a-hoop courage of thine. I fear much that,\r\nlike a hot-mettled horse, it will carry the owner into some scrape, out\r\nof which he will find it difficult to extricate himself, especially if\r\nthe daring spirit which bore thee thither should chance to fail thee\r\nat a pinch. Remember, Darsie, thou art not naturally courageous; on\r\nthe contrary, we have long since agreed that, quiet as I am, I have the\r\nadvantage in this important particular. My courage consists, I think,\r\nin strength of nerves and constitutional indifference to danger; which,\r\nthough it never pushes me on adventure, secures me in full use of\r\nmy recollection, and tolerably complete self-possession, when danger\r\nactually arrives. Now, thine seems more what may be called intellectual\r\ncourage; highness of spirit, and desire of distinction; impulses which\r\nrender thee alive to the love of fame, and deaf to the apprehension of\r\ndanger, until it forces itself suddenly upon thee. I own that, whether\r\nit is from my having caught my father\'s apprehensions, or that I have\r\nreason to entertain doubts of my own, I often think that this wildfire\r\nchase of romantic situation and adventure may lead thee into some\r\nmischief; and then what would become of Alan Fairford? They might make\r\nwhom they pleased Lord Advocate or Solicitor-General, I should never\r\nhave the heart to strive for it. All my exertions are intended to\r\nVindicate myself one day in your eyes; and I think I should not care\r\na farthing for the embroidered silk gown, more than for an old woman\'s\r\napron, unless I had hopes that thou shouldst be walking the boards to\r\nadmire, and perhaps to envy me.\r\n\r\nThat this may be the case, I prithee--beware! See not a Dulcinea, in\r\nevery slipshod girl, who, with blue eyes, fair hair, a tattered plaid,\r\nand a willow-wand in her grip, drives out the village cows to the\r\nloaning. Do not think you will meet a gallant Valentine in every English\r\nrider, or an Orson in every Highland drover. View things as they are,\r\nand not as they may be magnified through thy teeming fancy. I have seen\r\nthee look at an old gravel pit, till thou madest out capes, and bays,\r\nand inlets, crags and precipices, and the whole stupendous scenery of\r\nthe Isle of Feroe, in what was, to all ordinary eyes, a mere horse-pond.\r\nBesides, did I not once find thee gazing with respect at a lizard, in\r\nthe attitude of one who looks upon a crocodile? Now this is, doubtless,\r\nso far a harmless exercise of your imagination; for the puddle cannot\r\ndrown you, nor the Lilliputian alligator eat you up. But it is different\r\nin society, where you cannot mistake the character of those you converse\r\nwith, or suffer your fancy to exaggerate their qualities, good or bad,\r\nwithout exposing yourself not only to ridicule, but to great and serious\r\ninconveniences. Keep guard, therefore, on your imagination, my dear\r\nDarsie; and let your old friend assure you, it is the point of your\r\ncharacter most pregnant with peril to its good and generous owner.\r\nAdieu! let not the franks of the worthy peer remain unemployed; above\r\nall, SIS MEMOR MEI. A. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III\r\n\r\nDARSIE LATIMER TO ALAN FAIRFORD\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD\'S BUSH.\r\n\r\nI have received thine absurd and most conceited epistle. It is well\r\nfor thee that, Lovelace and Belford-like, we came under a convention\r\nto pardon every species of liberty which we may take with each other;\r\nsince, upon my word, there are some reflections in your last which would\r\notherwise have obliged me to return forthwith to Edinburgh, merely to\r\nshow you I was not what you took me for.\r\n\r\nWhy, what a pair of prigs hast thou made of us! I plunging into scrapes,\r\nwithout having courage to get out of them--thy sagacious self, afraid\r\nto put one foot before the other, lest it should run away from its\r\ncompanion; and so standing still like a post, out of mere faintness\r\nand coldness of heart, while all the world were driving full speed past\r\nthee. Thou a portrait-painter! I tell thee, Alan, I have seen a better\r\nseated on the fourth round of a ladder, and painting a bare-breeched\r\nHighlander, holding a pint-stoup as big as himself, and a booted\r\nLowlander, in a bobwig, supporting a glass of like dimensions; the whole\r\nbeing designed to represent the sign of the Salutation.\r\n\r\nHow hadst thou the heart to represent thine own individual self, with\r\nall thy motions, like those of a great Dutch doll, depending on the\r\npressure of certain springs, as duty, reflection, and the like; without\r\nthe impulse of which, thou wouldst doubtless have me believe thou\r\nwouldst not budge an inch! But have I not seen Gravity out of his bed at\r\nmidnight? and must I, in plain terms, remind thee of certain mad pranks?\r\nThou hadst ever, with the gravest sentiments in thy mouth and the most\r\nstarched reserve in thy manner, a kind of lumbering proclivity towards\r\nmischief, although with more inclination to set it a-going than address\r\nto carry it through; and I cannot but chuckle internally, when I think\r\nof having seen my most venerable monitor, the future president of some\r\nhigh Scottish court, puffing, blowing, and floundering, like a clumsy\r\ncart-horse in a bog where his efforts to extricate himself only plunged\r\nhim deeper at every awkward struggle, till some one--I myself, for\r\nexample--took compassion on the moaning monster, and dragged him out by\r\nmane and tail.\r\n\r\nAs for me, my portrait is, if possible, even more scandalously\r\ncaricatured, I fail or quail in spirit at the upcome! Where canst thou\r\nshow me the least symptom of the recreant temper, with which thou hast\r\ninvested me (as I trust) merely to set off the solid and impassible\r\ndignity of thine own stupid indifference? If you ever saw me tremble, be\r\nassured that my flesh, like that of the old Spanish general, only quaked\r\nat the dangers into which my spirit was about to lead it. Seriously,\r\nAlan, this imputed poverty of spirit is a shabby charge to bring against\r\nyour friend. I have examined myself as closely as I can, being, in very\r\ntruth, a little hurt at your having such hard thoughts of me, and on\r\nmy life I can see no reason for them. I allow you have, perhaps, some\r\nadvantage of me in the steadiness and indifference of your temper; but I\r\nshould despise myself, if I were conscious of the deficiency in courage\r\nwhich you seem willing enough to impute to me. However, I suppose, this\r\nungracious hint proceeds from sincere anxiety for my safety; and so\r\nviewing it, I swallow it as I would do medicine from a friendly doctor,\r\nalthough I believed in my heart he had mistaken my complaint.\r\n\r\nThis offensive insinuation disposed of, I thank thee, Alan, for the rest\r\nof thy epistle. I thought I heard your good father pronouncing the word\r\nNoble House, with a mixture of contempt and displeasure, as if the very\r\nname of the poor little hamlet were odious to him, or as if you had\r\nselected, out of all Scotland, the very place at which you had no call\r\nto dine. But if he had had any particular aversion to that blameless\r\nvillage and very sorry inn, is it not his own fault that I did not\r\naccept the invitation of the Laird of Glengallacher, to shoot a buck\r\nin what he emphatically calls \'his country\'? Truth is, I had a strong\r\ndesire to have complied with his lairdship\'s invitation. To shoot a\r\nbuck! Think how magnificent an idea to one who never shot anything but\r\nhedge-sparrows, and that with a horse-pistol purchased at a broker\'s\r\nstand in the Cowgate! You, who stand upon your courage, may remember\r\nthat I took the risk of firing the said pistol for the first time, while\r\nyou stood at twenty yards\' distance; and that, when you were persuaded\r\nit would go off without bursting, forgetting all law but that of the\r\nbiggest and strongest, you possessed yourself of it exclusively for the\r\nrest of the holidays. Such a day\'s sport was no complete introduction to\r\nthe noble art of deer-stalking, as it is practised in the Highlands; but\r\nI should not have scrupled to accept honest Glengallacher\'s invitation,\r\nat the risk of firing a rifle for the first time, had it not been for\r\nthe outcry which your father made at my proposal, in the full ardour of\r\nhis zeal for King George, the Hanover succession, and the Presbyterian\r\nfaith. I wish I had stood out, since I have gained so little upon\r\nhis good opinion by submission. All his impressions concerning the\r\nHighlanders are taken from the recollections of the Forty-five, when he\r\nretreated from the West Port with his brother volunteers, each to\r\nthe fortalice of his own separate dwelling, so soon as they heard the\r\nAdventurer was arrived with his clans as near them as Kirkliston. The\r\nflight of Falkirk--PARMA NON BENE SELECTA--in which I think your sire\r\nhad his share with the undaunted western regiment, does not seem to have\r\nimproved his taste for the company of the Highlanders; (quaere,\r\nAlan, dost thou derive the courage thou makest such boast of from an\r\nhereditary source?) and stories of Rob Roy Macgregor, and Sergeant Alan\r\nMhor Cameron, have served to paint them in still more sable colours to\r\nhis imagination. [Of Rob Roy we have had more than enough. Alan Cameron,\r\ncommonly called Sergeant Mhor, a freebooter of the same period, was\r\nequally remarkable for strength, courage, and generosity.]\r\n\r\nNow, from all I can understand, these ideas, as applied to the present\r\nstate of the country, are absolutely chimerical. The Pretender is\r\nno more remembered in the Highlands than if the poor gentleman were\r\ngathered to his hundred and eight fathers, whose portraits adorn the\r\nancient walls of Holyrood; the broadswords have passed into other hands;\r\nthe targets are used to cover the butter churns; and the race has sunk,\r\nor is fast sinking, from ruffling bullies into tame cheaters. Indeed, it\r\nwas partly my conviction that there is little to be seen in the north,\r\nwhich, arriving at your father\'s conclusions, though from different\r\npremisses, inclined my course in this direction, where perhaps I shall\r\nsee as little.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, I HAVE seen; and it was with pleasure the more\r\nindescribable, that I was debarred from treading the land which my eyes\r\nwere permitted to gaze upon, like those of the dying prophet from top\r\nof Mount Pisgah,--I have seen, in a word, the fruitful shores of merry\r\nEngland; merry England! of which I boast myself a native, and on which\r\nI gaze, even while raging floods and unstable quicksands divide us, with\r\nthe filial affection of a dutiful son.\r\n\r\nThou canst not have forgotten, Alan--for when didst thou ever forget\r\nwhat was interesting to thy friend?--that the same letter from my friend\r\nGriffiths, which doubled my income, and placed my motions at my own\r\nfree disposal, contained a prohibitory clause, by which, reason none\r\nassigned, I was prohibited, as I respected my present safety and\r\nfuture fortunes, from visiting England; every other part of the British\r\ndominions, and a tour, if I pleased, on the Continent, being left to my\r\nown choice.--Where is the tale, Alan, of a covered dish in the midst\r\nof a royal banquet, upon which the eyes of every guest were immediately\r\nfixed, neglecting all the dainties with which the table was loaded? This\r\ncause of banishment from England--from my native country--from the land\r\nof the brave, and the wise, and the free--affects me more than I am\r\nrejoiced by the freedom and independence assigned to me in all other\r\nrespects. Thus, in seeking this extreme boundary of the country which\r\nI am forbidden to tread, I resemble the poor tethered horse, which, you\r\nmay have observed, is always grazing on the very verge of the circle to\r\nwhich it is limited by its halter.\r\n\r\nDo not accuse me of romance for obeying this impulse towards the South;\r\nnor suppose that, to satisfy the imaginary longing of an idle curiosity,\r\nI am in any danger of risking the solid comforts of my present\r\ncondition. Whoever has hitherto taken charge of my motions has shown me,\r\nby convincing proofs more weighty than the assurances which they have\r\nwitheld, that my real advantage is their principal object. I should be,\r\ntherefore, worse than a fool did I object to their authority, even when\r\nit seems somewhat capriciously exercised; for assuredly, at my age, I\r\nmight--intrusted as I am with the care and management of myself in every\r\nother particular--expect that the cause of excluding me from England\r\nshould be frankly and fairly stated for my own consideration and\r\nguidance. However, I will not grumble about the matter. I shall know the\r\nwhole story one day, I suppose; and perhaps, as you sometimes surmise, I\r\nshall not find there is any mighty matter in it after all.\r\n\r\nYet one cannot help wondering--but plague on it, if I wonder any\r\nlonger, my letter will be as full of wonders as one of Katterfelto\'s\r\nadvertisements. I have a month\'s mind, instead of this damnable\r\niteration of guesses and forebodings, to give thee the history of a\r\nlittle adventure which befell me yesterday; though I am sure you will,\r\nas usual, turn the opposite side of the spyglass on my poor narrative,\r\nand reduce, MORE TUO, to the most petty trivialities, the circumstance\r\nto which thou accusest me of giving undue consequence. Hang thee, Alan,\r\nthou art as unfit a confidant for a youthful gallant with some spice\r\nof imagination, as the old taciturn secretary of Facardin of Trebizond.\r\nNevertheless, we must each perform our separate destinies. I am doomed\r\nto see, act, and tell; thou, like a Dutchman enclosed in the same\r\ndiligence with a Gascon, to hear, and shrug thy shoulders.\r\n\r\nOf Dumfries, the capital town of this county, I have but little to say,\r\nand will not abuse your patience by reminding you that it is built on\r\nthe gallant river Nith, and that its churchyard, the highest place of\r\nthe old town, commands an extensive and fine prospect. Neither will I\r\ntake the traveller\'s privilege of inflicting upon you the whole history\r\nof Bruce poniarding the Red Comyn in the Church of the Dominicans\r\nat this place, and becoming a king and patriot because he had been a\r\nchurch-breaker and a murderer. The present Dumfriezers remember and\r\njustify the deed, observing it was only a papist church--in evidence\r\nwhereof, its walls have been so completely demolished that no vestiges\r\nof them remain. They are a sturdy set of true-blue Presbyterians, these\r\nburghers of Dumfries; men after your father\'s own heart, zealous for the\r\nProtestant succession--the rather that many of the great families around\r\nare suspected to be of a different way of thinking, and shared, a great\r\nmany of them, in the insurrection of the Fifteen, and some in the more\r\nrecent business of the Forty-five. The town itself suffered in the\r\nlatter era; for Lord Elcho, with a large party of the rebels, levied\r\na severe contribution upon Dumfries, on account of the citizens having\r\nannoyed the rear of the Chevalier during his march into England.\r\n\r\nMany of these particulars I learned from Provost C--, who, happening to\r\nsee me in the market-place, remembered that I was an intimate of your\r\nfather\'s, and very kindly asked me to dinner. Pray tell your father that\r\nthe effects of his kindness to me follow me everywhere. I became tired,\r\nhowever, of this pretty town in the course of twenty-four hours, and\r\ncrept along the coast eastwards, amusing myself with looking out for\r\nobjects of antiquity, and sometimes making, or attempting to make, use\r\nof my new angling-rod. By the way, old Cotton\'s instructions, by which\r\nI hoped to qualify myself for one of the gentle society of anglers, are\r\nnot worth a farthing for this meridian. I learned this by mere accident,\r\nafter I had waited four mortal hours. I shall never forget an impudent\r\nurchin, a cowherd, about twelve years old, without either brogue or\r\nbonnet, barelegged, and with a very indifferent pair of breeches--how\r\nthe villain grinned in scorn at my landing-net, my plummet, and the\r\ngorgeous jury of flies which I had assembled to destroy all the fish\r\nin the river. I was induced at last to lend the rod to the sneering\r\nscoundrel, to see what he would make of it; and he had not only half\r\nfilled my basket in an hour, but literally taught me to kill two trouts\r\nwith my own hand. This, and Sam having found the hay and oats, not\r\nforgetting the ale, very good at this small inn, first made me take\r\nthe fancy of resting here for a day or two; and I have got my grinning\r\nblackguard of a piscator leave to attend on me, by paying sixpence a day\r\nfor a herd-boy in his stead.\r\n\r\nA notably clean Englishwoman keeps this small house, and my bedroom is\r\nsweetened with lavender, has a clean sash-window, and the walls are,\r\nmoreover, adorned with ballads of Fair Rosamond and Cruel Barbara Allan.\r\nThe woman\'s accent, though uncouth enough, sounds yet kindly in my ear;\r\nfor I have never yet forgotten the desolate effect produced on my\r\ninfant organs, when I heard on all sides your slow and broad northern\r\npronunciation, which was to me the tone of a foreign land. I am sensible\r\nI myself have since that time acquired Scotch in perfection, and many a\r\nScotticism withal. Still the sound of the English accentuation comes to\r\nmy ears as the tones of a friend; and even when heard from the mouth of\r\nsome wandering beggar, it has seldom failed to charm forth my mite.\r\nYou Scotch, who are so proud of your own nationality, must make due\r\nallowance for that of other folks.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning I was about to set forth to the stream where I had\r\ncommenced angler the night before, but was prevented by a heavy shower\r\nof rain from stirring abroad the whole forenoon; during all which time,\r\nI heard my varlet of a guide as loud with his blackguard jokes in the\r\nkitchen, as a footman in the shilling gallery; so little are modesty and\r\ninnocence the inseparable companions of rusticity and seclusion.\r\n\r\nWhen after dinner the day cleared, and we at length sallied out to the\r\nriver side, I found myself subjected to a new trick on the part of my\r\naccomplished preceptor. Apparently, he liked fishing himself better than\r\nthe trouble of instructing an awkward novice such as I; and in hopes of\r\nexhausting my patience, and inducing me to resign the rod, as I had done\r\nthe preceding day, my friend contrived to keep me thrashing the water\r\nmore than an hour with a pointless hook. I detected this trick at last,\r\nby observing the rogue grinning with delight when he saw a large trout\r\nrise and dash harmless away from the angle. I gave him a sound cuff,\r\nAlan; but the next moment was sorry, and, to make amends, yielded\r\npossession of the fishing-rod for the rest of the evening, he\r\nundertaking to bring me home a dish of trouts for my supper, in\r\natonement for his offences.\r\n\r\nHaving thus got honourably rid of the trouble of amusing myself in a way\r\nI cared not for, I turned my steps towards the sea, or rather the Solway\r\nFirth which here separates the two sister kingdoms, and which lay at\r\nabout a mile\'s distance, by a pleasant walk over sandy knells, covered\r\nwith short herbage, which you call Links, and we English, Downs.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of my adventure would weary out my fingers, and must\r\nbe deferred until to-morrow, when you shall hear from me, by way of\r\ncontinuation; and, in the meanwhile, to prevent over-hasty conclusions,\r\nI must just hint to you, we are but yet on the verge of the adventure\r\nwhich it is my purpose to communicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SAME TO THE SAME\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD\'S BUSH.\r\n\r\nI mentioned in my last, that having abandoned my fishing-rod as an\r\nunprofitable implement, I crossed over the open downs which divided me\r\nfrom the margin of the Solway. When I reached the banks of the great\r\nestuary, which are here very bare and exposed, the waters had receded\r\nfrom the large and level space of sand, through which a stream,\r\nnow feeble and fordable, found its way to the ocean. The whole was\r\nilluminated by the beams of the low and setting sun, who showed\r\nhis ruddy front, like a warrior prepared for defence, over a huge\r\nbattlemented and turreted wall of crimson and black clouds, which\r\nappeared like an immense Gothic fortress, into which the lord of day was\r\ndescending. His setting rays glimmered bright upon the wet surface of\r\nthe sands, and the numberless pools of water by which it was covered,\r\nwhere the inequality of the ground had occasioned their being left by\r\nthe tide.\r\n\r\nThe scene was animated by the exertions of a number of horsemen, who\r\nwere actually employed in hunting salmon. Aye, Alan, lift up your\r\nhands and eyes as you will, I can give their mode of fishing no name so\r\nappropriate; for they chased the fish at full gallop, and struck them\r\nwith their barbed spears, as you see hunters spearing boars in the old\r\ntapestry. The salmon, to be sure, take the thing more quietly than the\r\nboars; but they are so swift in their own element, that to pursue\r\nand strike them is the task of a good horseman, with a quick eye, a\r\ndetermined hand, and full command both of his horse and weapon. The\r\nshouts of the fellows as they galloped up and down in the animating\r\nexercise--their loud bursts of laughter when any of their number caught\r\na fall--and still louder acclamations when any of the party made a\r\ncapital stroke with his lance--gave so much animation to the whole\r\nscene, that I caught the enthusiasm of the sport, and ventured forward\r\na considerable space on the sands. The feats of one horseman, in\r\nparticular, called forth so repeatedly the clamorous applause of his\r\ncompanions, that the very banks rang again with their shouts. He was a\r\ntall man, well mounted on a strong black horse, which he caused to turn\r\nand wind like a bird in the air, carried a longer spear than the others,\r\nand wore a sort of fur cap or bonnet, with a short feather in it,\r\nwhich gave him on the whole rather a superior appearance to the other\r\nfishermen. He seemed to hold some sort of authority among them, and\r\noccasionally directed their motions both by voice and hand: at which\r\ntimes I thought his gestures were striking, and his voice uncommonly\r\nsonorous and commanding.\r\n\r\nThe riders began to make for the shore, and the interest of the scene\r\nwas almost over, while I lingered on the sands, with my looks turned to\r\nthe shores of England, still gilded by the sun\'s last rays, and, as it\r\nseemed, scarce distant a mile from me. The anxious thoughts which\r\nhaunt me began to muster in my bosom, and my feet slowly and insensibly\r\napproached the river which divided me from the forbidden precincts,\r\nthough without any formed intention, when my steps were arrested by\r\nthe sound of a horse galloping; and as I turned, the rider (the same\r\nfisherman whom I had formerly distinguished) called out to me, in\r\nan abrupt manner, \'Soho, brother! you are too late for Bowness\r\nto-night--the tide will make presently.\'\r\n\r\nI turned my head and looked at him without answering; for, to my\r\nthinking, his sudden appearance (or rather, I should say, his unexpected\r\napproach) had, amidst the gathering shadows and lingering light,\r\nsomething in it which was wild and ominous.\r\n\r\n\'Are you deaf?\' he added--\'or are you mad?--or have you a mind for the\r\nnext world?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am a stranger,\' I answered,\' and had no other purpose than looking on\r\nat the fishing--I am about to return to the side I came from.\'\r\n\r\n\'Best make haste then,\' said he. \'He that dreams on the bed of the\r\nSolway, may wake in the next world. The sky threatens a blast that will\r\nbring in the waves three feet abreast.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he turned his horse and rode off, while I began to walk back\r\ntowards the Scottish shore, a little alarmed at what I had heard;\r\nfor the tide advances with such rapidity upon these fatal sands, that\r\nwell-mounted horsemen lay aside hopes of safety, if they see its white\r\nsurge advancing while they are yet at a distance from the bank.\r\n\r\nThese recollections grew more agitating, and, instead of walking\r\ndeliberately, I began a race as fast as I could, feeling, or thinking I\r\nfelt, each pool of salt water through which I splashed, grow deeper and\r\ndeeper. At length the surface of the sand did seem considerably more\r\nintersected with pools and channels full of water--either that the tide\r\nwas really beginning to influence the bed of the estuary, or, as I must\r\nown is equally probable, that I had, in the hurry and confusion of my\r\nretreat, involved myself in difficulties which I had avoided in my more\r\ndeliberate advance. Either way, it was rather an unpromising state of\r\naffairs, for the sands at the same time turned softer, and my footsteps,\r\nso soon as I had passed, were instantly filled with water. I began to\r\nhave odd recollections concerning the snugness of your father\'s parlour,\r\nand the secure footing afforded by the pavement of Brown\'s Square and\r\nScott\'s Close, when my better genius, the tall fisherman, appeared once\r\nmore close to my side, he and his sable horse looming gigantic in the\r\nnow darkening twilight.\r\n\r\n\'Are you mad?\' he said, in the same deep tone which had before thrilled\r\non my ear, \'or are you weary of your life? You will be presently amongst\r\nthe quicksands.\' I professed my ignorance of the way, to which he only\r\nreplied, \'There is no time for prating--get up behind me.\'\r\n\r\nHe probably expected me to spring from the ground with the activity\r\nwhich these Borderers have, by constant practice, acquired in everything\r\nrelating to horsemanship; but as I stood irresolute, he extended his\r\nhand, and grasping mine, bid me place my foot on the toe of his boot,\r\nand thus raised me in a trice to the croupe of his horse. I was scarcely\r\nsecurely seated, ere he shook the reins of his horse, who instantly\r\nsprang forward; but annoyed, doubtless, by the unusual burden, treated\r\nus to two or three bounds, accompanied by as many flourishes of his hind\r\nheels. The rider sat like a tower, notwithstanding that the unexpected\r\nplunging of the animal threw me forward upon him. The horse was soon\r\ncompelled to submit to the discipline of the spur and bridle, and went\r\noff at a steady hand gallop; thus shortening the devious, for it was\r\nby no means a direct path, by which the rider, avoiding the loose\r\nquicksands, made for the northern bank.\r\n\r\nMy friend, perhaps I may call him my preserver,--for, to a stranger, my\r\nsituation was fraught with real danger,--continued to press on at the\r\nsame speedy pace, but in perfect silence, and I was under too much\r\nanxiety of mind to disturb him with any questions. At length we arrived\r\nat a part of the shore with which I was utterly unacquainted, when I\r\nalighted and began to return in the best fashion I could my thanks for\r\nthe important service which he had just rendered me.\r\n\r\nThe stranger only replied by an impatient \'pshaw!\' and was about to ride\r\noff, and leave me to my own resources when I implored him to complete\r\nhis work of kindness by directing me to Shepherd\'s Bush, which was, as I\r\ninformed him, my home for the present.\r\n\r\n\'To Shepherd\'s Bush?\' he said; \'it is but three miles but if you know\r\nnot the land better than the sand, you may break your neck before you\r\nget there; for it is no road for a moping boy in a dark night; and,\r\nbesides, there are the brook and the fens to cross.\'\r\n\r\nI was a little dismayed at this communication of such difficulties as my\r\nhabits had not called on me to contend with. Once more the idea of thy\r\nfather\'s fireside came across me; and I could have been well contented\r\nto have swapped the romance of my situation, together with the glorious\r\nindependence of control which I possessed at the moment, for the\r\ncomforts of that chimney-corner, though I were obliged to keep my eyes\r\nchained to Erskine\'s LARGER INSTITUTES.\r\n\r\nI asked my new friend whether he could not direct me to any house of\r\npublic entertainment for the night; and supposing it probable he was\r\nhimself a poor man, I added, with the conscious dignity of a well-filled\r\npocket-book, that I could make it worth any man\'s while to oblige me.\r\nThe fisherman making no answer, I turned away from him with as gallant\r\nan appearance of indifference as I could command, and began to take, as\r\nI thought, the path which he had pointed out to me.\r\n\r\nHis deep voice immediately sounded after me to recall me. \'Stay, young\r\nman, stay--you have mistaken the road already.--I wonder your friends\r\nsent out such an inconsiderate youth, without some one wiser than\r\nhimself to take care of him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps they might not have done so,\' said I, \'if I had any friends who\r\ncared about the matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, sir,\' he said, \'it is not my custom to open my house to\r\nstrangers, but your pinch is like to be a smart one; for, besides the\r\nrisk from bad roads, fords, and broken ground, and the night,\r\nwhich looks both black and gloomy, there is bad company on the road\r\nsometimes--at least it has a bad name, and some have come to harm; so\r\nthat I think I must for once make my rule give way to your necessity,\r\nand give you a night\'s lodging in my cottage.\r\n\r\nWhy was it, Alan, that I could not help giving an involuntary shudder at\r\nreceiving an invitation so seasonable in itself, and so suitable to my\r\nnaturally inquisitive disposition? I easily suppressed this untimely\r\nsensation; and as I returned thanks, and expressed my hope that I should\r\nnot disarrange, his family, I once more dropped a hint of my desire to\r\nmake compensation for any trouble I might occasion. The man answered\r\nvery coldly, \'Your presence will no doubt give me trouble, sir, but it\r\nis of a kind which your purse, cannot compensate; in a word, although\r\nI am content to receive you as my guest, I am no publican to call a\r\nreckoning.\'\r\n\r\nI begged his pardon, and, at his instance, once more seated myself\r\nbehind hint upon the good horse, which went forth steady as before--the\r\nmoon, whenever she could penetrate the clouds, throwing the huge shadow\r\nof the animal, with its double burden, on the wild and bare ground over\r\nwhich we passed.\r\n\r\nThou mayst laugh till thou lettest the letter fall, if thou wilt, but\r\nit reminded me of the magician Atlantes on his hippogriff with a knight\r\ntrussed up behind him, in the manner Ariosto has depicted that matter.\r\nThou art I know, matter-of-fact enough to affect contempt of that\r\nfascinating and delicious poem; but think not that, to conform with\r\nthy bad taste, I shall forbear any suitable illustration which now or\r\nhereafter may occur to me.\r\n\r\nOn we went, the sky blackening around us, and the wind beginning to pipe\r\nsuch a wild and melancholy tune as best suited the hollow sounds of the\r\nadvancing tide, which I could hear at a distance, like the roar of some\r\nimmense monster defrauded of its prey.\r\n\r\nAt length, our course was crossed by a deep dell or dingle, such as they\r\ncall in some parts of Scotland a den, and in others a cleuch or narrow\r\nglen. It seemed, by the broken glances which the moon continued to\r\nthrow upon it, to be steep, precipitous, and full of trees, which are,\r\ngenerally speaking, rather scarce upon these shores. The descent by\r\nwhich we plunged into this dell was both steep and rugged, with two\r\nor three abrupt turnings; but neither danger nor darkness impeded the\r\nmotion of the black horse, who seemed rather to slide upon his haunches,\r\nthan to gallop down the pass, throwing me again on the shoulders of the\r\nathletic rider, who, sustaining no inconvenience by the circumstance,\r\ncontinued to press the horse forward with his heel, steadily supporting\r\nhim at the same time by raising his bridle-hand, until we stood in\r\nsafety at the bottom of the steep--not a little to my consolation, as,\r\nfriend Alan, thou mayst easily conceive.\r\n\r\nA very short advance up the glen, the bottom of which we had attained by\r\nthis ugly descent, brought us in front of two or three cottages, one\r\nof which another blink of moonshine enabled me to rate as rather better\r\nthan those of the Scottish peasantry in this part of the world; for the\r\nsashes seemed glazed, and there were what are called storm-windows in\r\nthe roof, giving symptoms of the magnificence of a second story. The\r\nscene around was very interesting; for the cottages, and the yards or\r\ncrofts annexed to them, occupied a haugh, or helm, of two acres, which\r\na brook of some consequence (to judge from its roar) had left upon one\r\nside of the little glen while finding its course close to the farther\r\nbank, and which appeared to be covered and darkened with trees, while\r\nthe level space beneath enjoyed such stormy smiles as the moon had that\r\nnight to bestow.\r\n\r\nI had little time for observation, for my companion\'s loud whistle,\r\nseconded by an equally loud halloo, speedily brought to the door of\r\nthe principal cottage a man and a woman, together with two large\r\nNewfoundland dogs, the deep baying of which I had for some time heard. A\r\nyelping terrier or two, which had joined the concert, were silent at\r\nthe presence of my conductor, and began to whine, jump up, and fawn upon\r\nhim. The female drew back when she beheld a stranger; the man, who had\r\na lighted lantern, advanced, and, without any observation, received the\r\nhorse from my host, and led him, doubtless, to stable, while I followed\r\nmy conductor into the house. When we had passed the HALLAN, [The\r\npartition which divides a Scottish cottage.] we entered a well-sized\r\napartment, with a clean brick floor, where a fire blazed (much to my\r\ncontentment) in the ordinary projecting sort of a chimney, common in\r\nScottish houses. There were stone seats within the chimney; and ordinary\r\nutensils, mixed with fishing-spears, nets, and similar implements of\r\nsport, were hung around the walls of the place. The female who had first\r\nappeared at the door, had now retreated into a side apartment. She was\r\npresently followed by my guide, after he had silently motioned me to a\r\nseat; and their place was supplied by an elderly woman, in a grey stuff\r\ngown, with a check apron and toy, obviously a menial, though neater in\r\nher dress than is usual in her apparent rank--an advantage which was\r\ncounterbalanced by a very forbidding aspect. But the most singular part\r\nof her attire, in this very Protestant country, was a rosary, in which\r\nthe smaller beads were black oak, and those indicating the PATER-NOSTER\r\nof silver, with a crucifix of the same metal.\r\n\r\nThis person made preparations for supper, by spreading a clean though\r\ncoarse cloth over a large oaken table, placing trenchers and salt upon\r\nit, and arranging the fire to receive a gridiron. I observed her motions\r\nin silence; for she took no sort of notice of me, and as her looks were\r\nsingularly forbidding, I felt no disposition to commence conversation.\r\n\r\nWhen this duenna had made all preliminary arrangements, she took from\r\nthe well-filled pouch of my conductor, which he had hung up by the\r\ndoor, one or two salmon, or GRILSES, as the smaller sort are termed, and\r\nselecting that which seemed best and in highest season, began to cut\r\nit into slices, and to prepare a GRILLADE; the savoury smell of which\r\naffected me so powerfully that I began sincerely to hope that no delay\r\nwould intervene between the platter and the lip.\r\n\r\nAs this thought came across me, the man who had conducted the horse to\r\nthe stable entered the apartment, and discovered to me a countenance yet\r\nmore uninviting than that of the old crone who was performing with such\r\ndexterity the office of cook to the party. He was perhaps sixty years\r\nold; yet his brow was not much furrowed, and his jet-black hair was only\r\ngrizzled, not whitened, by the advance of age. All his motions spoke\r\nstrength unabated; and, though rather undersized, he had very broad\r\nshoulders, was square-made, thin-flanked, and apparently combined in his\r\nframe muscular strength and activity; the last somewhat impaired perhaps\r\nby years, but the first remaining in full vigour. A hard and harsh\r\ncountenance--eyes far sunk under projecting eyebrows, which were\r\ngrizzled like his hair--a wide mouth, furnished from ear to ear with it\r\nrange of unimpaired teeth, of uncommon whiteness, and a size and breadth\r\nwhich might have become the jaws of an ogre, completed this delightful\r\nportrait. He was clad like a fisherman, in jacket and trousers of the\r\nblue cloth commonly used by seamen, and had a Dutch case-knife, like\r\nthat of a Hamburgh skipper, stuck into a broad buff belt, which seemed\r\nas if it might occasionally sustain weapons of a description still less\r\nequivocally calculated for violence.\r\n\r\nThis man gave me an inquisitive, and, as I thought, a sinister look upon\r\nentering the apartment; but without any further notice of me, took up\r\nthe office of arranging the table, which the old lady had abandoned for\r\nthat of cooking the fish, and, with more address than I expected from\r\na person of his coarse appearance, placed two chairs at the head of the\r\ntable, and two stools below; accommodating each seat to a cover, beside\r\nwhich he placed an allowance of barley-bread, and a small jug, which he\r\nreplenished with ale from a large black jack. Three of these jugs\r\nwere of ordinary earthenware, but the fourth, which he placed by the\r\nright-hand cover at, the upper end of the table, was a flagon of\r\nsilver, and displayed armorial bearings. Beside this flagon he placed a\r\nsalt-cellar of silver, handsomely wrought, containing salt of exquisite\r\nwhiteness, with pepper and other spices. A sliced lemon was also\r\npresented on a small silver salver. The two large water-dogs, who\r\nseemed perfectly to understand the nature of the preparations, seated\r\nthemselves one on each side of the table, to be ready to receive their\r\nportion of the entertainment. I never saw finer animals, or which\r\nseemed to be more influenced by a sense of decorum, excepting that they\r\nslobbered a little as the rich scent from the chimney was wafted past\r\ntheir noses. The small dogs ensconced themselves beneath the table.\r\n\r\nI am aware that I am dwelling upon trivial and ordinary circumstances,\r\nand that perhaps I may weary out your patience in doing so. But conceive\r\nme alone in this strange place, which seemed, from the universal\r\nsilence, to be the very temple of Harpocrates--remember that this is\r\nmy first excursion from home--forget not that the manner in which I had\r\nbeen brought hither had the dignity of danger and something the air of\r\nan adventure, and that there was a mysterious incongruity in all I had\r\nhitherto witnessed; and you will not, I think, be surprised that these\r\ncircumstances, though trifling, should force themselves on my notice at\r\nthe time, and dwell in my memory afterwards.\r\n\r\nThat a fisher, who pursued the sport perhaps for his amusement as well\r\nas profit, should be well mounted and better lodged than the lower class\r\nof peasantry, had in it nothing surprising; but there was something\r\nabout all that I saw which seemed to intimate that I was rather in\r\nthe abode of a decayed gentleman, who clung to a few of the forms and\r\nobservances of former rank, than in that of a common peasant, raised\r\nabove his fellows by comparative opulence.\r\n\r\nBesides the articles of plate which I have already noticed, the old man\r\nnow lighted and placed on the table a silver lamp, or CRUISIE as the\r\nScottish term it, filled with very pure oil, which in burning diffused\r\nan aromatic fragrance, and gave me a more perfect view of the cottage\r\nwalls, which I had hitherto only seen dimly by the light of the fire.\r\nThe BINK [The frame of wooden shelves placed in a Scottish kitchen for\r\nholding plates.] with its usual arrangement of pewter and earthenware,\r\nwhich was most strictly and critically clean, glanced back the flame of\r\nthe lamp merrily from one side of the apartment. In a recess, formed\r\nby the small bow of a latticed window, was a large writing-desk of\r\nwalnut-tree wood, curiously carved, above which arose shelves of the\r\nsame, which supported a few books and papers. The opposite side of the\r\nrecess contained (as far as I could discern, for it lay in shadow, and\r\nI could at any rate have seen it but imperfectly from the place where\r\nI was seated) one or two guns, together with swords, pistols, and\r\nother arms a collection which, in a poor cottage, and in a country so\r\npeaceful, appeared singular at least, if not even somewhat suspicious.\r\n\r\nAll these observations, you may suppose, were made much sooner than I\r\nhave recorded, or you (if you have not skipped) have been able to read\r\nthem. They were already finished, and I was considering how I should\r\nopen some communication with the mute inhabitants of the mansion, when\r\nmy conductor re-entered from the side-door by which he had made his\r\nexit.\r\n\r\nHe had now thrown off his rough riding-cap, and his coarse jockey-coat,\r\nAnd stood before me in a grey jerkin trimmed with black, which sat close\r\nto, and set off, his large and sinewy frame, and a pair of trousers of\r\na lighter colour, cut as close to the body as they are used by\r\nHighlandmen. His whole dress was of finer cloth than that of the old\r\nman; and his linen, so minute was my observation, clean and unsullied.\r\nHis shirt was without ruffles, and tied at the collar with a black\r\nribbon, which showed his strong and muscular neck rising from it like\r\nthat of an ancient Hercules. His head was small, with a large forehead,\r\nand well-formed ears. He wore neither peruke nor hair-powder; and his\r\nchestnut locks, curling close to his head like those of an antique\r\nstatue, showed not the least touch of time, though the owner must have\r\nbeen at least fifty. His features were high and prominent in such a\r\ndegree that one knew not whether to term them harsh or handsome. In\r\neither case, the sparkling grey eye, aquiline nose, and well-formed\r\nmouth, combined to render his physiognomy noble and expressive. An air\r\nof sadness, or severity, or of both, seemed to indicate a melancholy,\r\nand, at the same time, a haughty temper. I could not help running\r\nmentally over the ancient heroes, to whom I might assimilate the noble\r\nform and countenance before me. He was too young, and evinced too little\r\nresignation to his fate, to resemble Belisarius. Coriolanus, standing by\r\nthe hearth of Tullus Aufidius, came nearer the mark; yet the gloomy and\r\nhaughty look of the stranger had, perhaps, still more of Marius, seated\r\namong the ruins of Carthage.\r\n\r\nWhile I was lost in these imaginations, my host stood by the fire,\r\ngazing on me with the same attention which I paid to him, until,\r\nembarrassed by his look, I was about to break silence at all hazards.\r\nBut the supper, now placed upon the table, reminded me, by its\r\nappearance, of those wants which I had almost forgotten while I was\r\ngazing on the fine form of my conductor. He spoke at length, and I\r\nalmost started at the deep rich tone of his voice, though what he said\r\nwas but to invite me to sit down to the table. He himself assumed the\r\nseat of honour, beside which the silver flagon was placed, and beckoned\r\nto me to sit down beside him.\r\n\r\nThou knowest thy father\'s strict and excellent domestic discipline has\r\ntrained me to bear the invocation of a blessing before we break the\r\ndaily bread, for which we are taught to pray--I paused a moment, and,\r\nwithout designing to do so, I suppose my manner made him sensible of\r\nwhat I expected. The two domestics or inferiors, as I should have before\r\nobserved, were already seated at the bottom of the table, when my\r\nhost shot a glance of a very peculiar expression towards the old man,\r\nobserving, with something approaching to a sneer, \'Cristal Nixon, say\r\ngrace--the gentleman expects one.\'\r\n\r\n\'The foul fiend shall be clerk, and say amen, when I turn chaplain,\'\r\ngrowled out the party addressed, in tones which might have become the\r\ncondition of a dying bear; \'if the gentleman is a whig, he may please\r\nhimself with his own mummery. My faith is neither in word nor writ, but\r\nin barley-bread and brown ale.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mabel Moffat,\' said my guide, looking at the old woman, and raising his\r\nsonorous voice, probably because she was hard of hearing, \'canst thou\r\nask a blessing upon our victuals?\'\r\n\r\nThe old woman shook her head, kissed the cross which hung from her\r\nrosary, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\'Mabel will say grace for no heretic,\' said the master of the house,\r\nwith the same latent sneer on his brow and in his accent.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, the side-door already mentioned opened, and the\r\nyoung woman (so she proved) whom I had first seen at the door of the\r\ncottage, advanced a little way into the room, then stopped bashfully, as\r\nif she had observed that I was looking at her, and asked the master of\r\nthe house, \'if he had called?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not louder than to make old Mabel hear me,\' he replied; \'and yet,\' be\r\nadded, as she turned to retire, \'it is a shame a stranger should see a\r\nhouse where not one of the family can or will say a grace--do thou be\r\nour chaplain.\'\r\n\r\nThe girl, who was really pretty, came forward with timid modesty, and,\r\napparently unconscious that she was doing anything uncommon,\r\npronounced the benediction in a silver-toned voice, and with affecting\r\nsimplicity--her cheek colouring just so much as to show that on a less\r\nsolemn occasion she would have felt more embarrassed.\r\n\r\nNow, if thou expectest a fine description of this young woman, Alan\r\nFairford, in order to entitle thee to taunt me with having found a\r\nDulcinea in the inhabitant of a fisherman\'s cottage on the Solway Firth,\r\nthou shalt be disappointed; for, having said she seemed very pretty,\r\nand that she was a sweet and gentle-speaking creature, I have said all\r\nconcerning her that I can tell thee. She vanished when the benediction\r\nwas spoken.\r\n\r\nMy host, with a muttered remark on the cold of our ride, and the keen\r\nair of the Solway Sands, to which he did not seem to wish an answer,\r\nloaded my plate from Mabel\'s grillade, which, with a large wooden bowl\r\nof potatoes, formed our whole meal. A sprinkling from the lemon gave a\r\nmuch higher zest than the usual condiment of vinegar; and I promise\r\nyou that whatever I might hitherto have felt, either of curiosity or\r\nsuspicion, did not prevent me from making a most excellent supper,\r\nduring which little passed betwixt me and my entertainer, unless that\r\nhe did the usual honours of the table with courtesy, indeed, but\r\nwithout even the affectation of hearty hospitality, which those in his\r\n(apparent) condition generally affect on such occasions, even when they\r\ndo not actually feel it. On the contrary, his manner seemed that of a\r\npolished landlord towards an unexpected and unwelcome guest, whom,\r\nfor the sake of his own credit, he receives with civility, but without\r\neither goodwill or cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nIf you ask how I learned all this, I cannot tell you; nor, were I to\r\nwrite down at length the insignificant intercourse which took place\r\nbetween us, would it perhaps serve to justify these observations. It is\r\nsufficient to say, that in helping his dogs, which he did from time\r\nto time with great liberality, he seemed to discharge a duty much more\r\npleasing to himself, than when he paid the same attention to his guest.\r\nUpon the whole, the result on my mind was as I tell it you.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was over, a small case-bottle of brandy, in a curious frame\r\nof silver filigree, circulated to the guests. I had already taken a\r\nsmall glass of the liquor, and, when it had passed to Mabel and to\r\nCristal and was again returned to the upper end of the table, I could\r\nnot help taking the bottle in my hand, to look more at the armorial\r\nbearings which were chased with considerable taste on the silver\r\nframework. Encountering the eye of my entertainer, I instantly saw that\r\nmy curiosity was highly distasteful; he frowned, bit his lip, and\r\nshowed such uncontrollable signs of impatience, that, setting the bottle\r\nimmediately down, I attempted some apology. To this he did not deign\r\neither to reply, or even to listen; and Cristal, at a signal from his\r\nmaster, removed the object of my curiosity, as well as the cup, upon\r\nwhich the same arms were engraved.\r\n\r\nThen ensued an awkward pause, which I endeavoured to break by observing,\r\nthat \'I feared my intrusion upon his hospitality had put his family to\r\nsome inconvenience\'.\r\n\r\n\'I hope you see no appearance of it, sir,\' he replied, with cold\r\ncivility. \'What inconvenience a family so retired as ours may suffer\r\nfrom receiving an unexpected guest is like to be trifling, in comparison\r\nof what the visitor himself sustains from want of his accustomed\r\ncomforts. So far, therefore, as our connexion stands, our accounts stand\r\nclear.\'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this discouraging reply, I blundered on, as is usual in\r\nsuch cases, wishing to appear civil, and being, perhaps, in reality the\r\nvery reverse. \'I was afraid,\' I said, that my presence had banished one\r\nof the family\' (looking at the side-door) \'from his table.\'\r\n\r\n\'If,\' he coldly replied, \'I meant the young woman whom I had seen in the\r\napartment, he bid me observe that there was room enough at the table\r\nfor her to have seated herself, and meat enough, such as it was, for her\r\nsupper. I might, therefore, be assured, if she had chosen it, she would\r\nhave supped with us.\'\r\n\r\nThere was no dwelling on this or any other topic longer; for my\r\nentertainer, taking up the lamp, observed, that \'my wet clothes might\r\nreconcile me for the night to their custom of keeping early hours; that\r\nhe was under the necessity of going abroad by peep of day to-morrow\r\nmorning, and would call me up at the same time, to point out the way by\r\nwhich I was to return to the Shepherd\'s Bush.\'\r\n\r\nThis left no opening for further explanation; nor was there room for it\r\non the usual terms of civility; for, as he neither asked my name, nor\r\nexpressed the least interest concerning my condition, I--the obliged\r\nperson--had no pretence to trouble him with such inquiries on my part.\r\n\r\nHe took up the lamp, and led me through the side-door into a very small\r\nroom, where a bed had been hastily arranged for my accommodation,\r\nand, putting down the lamp, directed me to leave my wet clothes on the\r\noutside of the door, that they might be exposed to the fire during the\r\nnight. He then left me, having muttered something which was meant to\r\npass for good night.\r\n\r\nI obeyed his directions with respect to my clothes, the rather that,\r\nin despite of the spirits which I had drunk, I felt my teeth begin\r\nto chatter, and received various hints from an aguish feeling, that\r\na town-bred youth, like myself, could not at once rush into all the\r\nhardihood of country sports with impunity. But my bed, though coarse and\r\nhard, was dry and clean; and I soon was so little occupied with my heats\r\nand tremors, as to listen with interest to a heavy foot, which seemed to\r\nbe that of my landlord, traversing the boards (there was no ceiling,\r\nas you may believe) which roofed my apartment. Light, glancing through\r\nthese rude planks, became visible as soon as my lamp was extinguished;\r\nand as the noise of the slow, solemn, and regular step continued, and I\r\ncould distinguish that the person turned and returned as he reached the\r\nend of the apartment, it seemed clear to me that the walker was engaged\r\nin no domestic occupation, but merely pacing to and fro for his own\r\npleasure. \'An odd amusement this,\' I thought, \'for one who had been\r\nengaged at least a part of the preceding day in violent exercise, and\r\nwho talked of rising by the peep of dawn on the ensuing morning.\'\r\n\r\nMeantime I heard the storm, which had been brewing during the evening,\r\nbegin to descend with a vengeance; sounds as of distant-thunder (the\r\nnoise of the more distant waves, doubtless, on the shore) mingled\r\nwith the roaring of the neighbouring torrent, and with the crashing,\r\ngroaning, and even screaming of the trees in the glen whose boughs were\r\ntormented by the gale. Within the house, windows clattered, and doors\r\nclapped, and the walls, though sufficiently substantial for a building\r\nof the kind, seemed to me to totter in the tempest.\r\n\r\nBut still the heavy steps perambulating the apartment over my head were\r\ndistinctly heard amid the roar and fury of the elements. I thought more\r\nthan once I even heard a groan; but I frankly own that, placed in this\r\nunusual situation, my fancy may have misled me. I was tempted several\r\ntimes to call aloud, and ask whether the turmoil around us did not\r\nthreaten danger to the building which we inhabited; but when I thought\r\nof the secluded and unsocial master of the dwelling, who seemed to avoid\r\nhuman society, and to remain unperturbed amid the elemental war, it\r\nseemed that to speak to him at that moment would have been to address\r\nthe spirit of the tempest himself, since no other being, I thought,\r\ncould have remained calm and tranquil while winds and waters were thus\r\nraging around.\r\n\r\nIn process of time, fatigue prevailed over anxiety and curiosity. The\r\nstorm abated, or my senses became deadened to its terrors, and I fell\r\nasleep ere yet the mysterious paces of my host had ceased to shake the\r\nflooring over my head.\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected that the novelty of my situation, although\r\nit did not prevent my slumbers, would have at least diminished their\r\nprofoundness, and shortened their duration. It proved otherwise,\r\nhowever; for I never slept more soundly in my life, and only awoke when,\r\nat morning dawn, my landlord shook me by the shoulder, and dispelled\r\nsome dream, of which, fortunately for you, I have no recollection,\r\notherwise you would have been favoured with it, in hopes you might have\r\nproved a second Daniel upon the occasion.\r\n\r\n\'You sleep sound--\' said his full deep voice; \'ere five years have\r\nrolled over your head, your slumbers will be lighter--unless ere then\r\nyou are wrapped in the sleep which is never broken.\'\r\n\r\n\'How!\' said I, starting up in the bed; \'do you know anything of me--of\r\nmy prospects--of my views in life?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' he answered, with a grim smile; \'but it is evident you are\r\nentering upon the world young, inexperienced, and full of hopes, and I\r\ndo but prophesy to you what I would to any one in your condition. But\r\ncome; there lie your clothes--a brown crust and a draught of milk wait\r\nyou, if you choose to break your fast; but you must make haste.\'\r\n\r\n\'I must first,\' I said, \'take the freedom to spend a few minutes alone,\r\nbefore beginning the ordinary works of the day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!--umph!--I cry your devotions pardon,\' he replied, and left the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nAlan, there is something terrible about this man.\r\n\r\nI joined him, as I had promised, in the kitchen where we had supped\r\novernight, where I found the articles which he had offered me for\r\nbreakfast, without butter or any other addition.\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down while I partook of the bread and milk; and the\r\nslow measured weighty step seemed identified with those which I had\r\nheard last night. His pace, from its funereal slowness, seemed to keep\r\ntime with some current of internal passion, dark, slow, and unchanged.\r\n\'We run and leap by the side of a lively and bubbling brook,\' thought I,\r\ninternally, \'as if we would run a race with it; but beside waters deep,\r\nslow, and lonely, our pace is sullen and silent as their course. What\r\nthoughts may be now corresponding with that furrowed brow, and bearing\r\ntime with that heavy step?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you have finished,\' said he, looking up to me with a glance of\r\nimpatience, as he observed that I ate no longer, but remained with my\r\neyes fixed upon him, \'I wait to show you the way.\'\r\n\r\nWe went out together, no individual of the family having been visible\r\nexcepting my landlord. I was disappointed of the opportunity which I\r\nwatched for of giving some gratuity to the domestics, as they seemed to\r\nbe. As for offering any recompense to the master of the household, it\r\nseemed to me impossible to have attempted it.\r\n\r\nWhat would I have given for a share of thy composure, who wouldst have\r\nthrust half a crown into a man\'s hand whose necessities seemed to crave\r\nit, conscious that you did right in making the proffer, and not caring\r\nsixpence whether you hurt the feelings of him whom you meant to serve!\r\nI saw thee once give a penny to a man with a long beard, who, from the\r\ndignity of his exterior, might have represented Solon. I had not thy\r\ncourage, and therefore I made no tender to my mysterious host, although,\r\nnotwithstanding his display of silver utensils, all around the house\r\nbespoke narrow circumstances, if not actual poverty.\r\n\r\nWe left the place together. But I hear thee murmur thy very new and\r\nappropriate ejaculation, OHE, JAM SATIS!--The rest for another time.\r\nPerhaps I may delay further communication till I learn how my favours\r\nare valued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V\r\n\r\nALAN FAIRFORD TO DARSIE LATIMER\r\n\r\nI have thy two last epistles, my dear Darsie, and expecting the third,\r\nhave been in no hurry to answer them. Do not think my silence ought to\r\nbe ascribed to my failing to take interest in them, for, truly, they\r\nexcel (though the task was difficult) thy usual excellings. Since\r\nthe moon-calf who earliest discovered the Pandemonium of Milton in an\r\nexpiring wood-fire--since the first ingenious urchin who blew bubbles\r\nout of soap and water, thou, my best of friends, hast the highest knack\r\nat making histories out of nothing. Wert thou to plant the bean in the\r\nnursery-tale, thou wouldst make out, so soon as it began to germinate,\r\nthat the castle of the giant was about to elevate its battlements on the\r\ntop of it. All that happens to thee gets a touch of the wonderful and\r\nthe sublime from thy own rich imagination. Didst ever see what artists\r\ncall a Claude Lorraine glass, which spreads its own particular hue over\r\nthe whole landscape which you see through it?--thou beholdest ordinary\r\nevents just through such a medium.\r\n\r\nI have looked carefully at the facts of thy last long letter, and they\r\nare just such as might have befallen any little truant of the High\r\nSchool, who had got down to Leith Sands, gone beyond the PRAWN-DUB, wet\r\nhis hose and shoon, and, finally, had been carried home, in compassion,\r\nby some high-kilted fishwife, cursing all the while the trouble which\r\nthe brat occasioned her.\r\n\r\nI admire the figure which thou must have made, clinging for dear life\r\nbehind the old fellow\'s back--thy jaws chattering with fear, thy muscles\r\ncramped with anxiety. Thy execrable supper of broiled salmon, which was\r\nenough to ensure the nightmare\'s regular visits for a twelvemonth,\r\nmay be termed a real affliction; but as for the storm of Thursday\r\nlast (such, I observe, was the date), it roared, whistled, howled, and\r\nbellowed, as fearfully amongst the old chimney-heads in the Candlemaker\r\nRow, as it could on the Solway shore, for the very wind of it--TESTE ME\r\nPER TOTAM NOCTEM VIGILANTE. And then in the morning again, when--Lord\r\nhelp you--in your sentimental delicacy you bid the poor man adieu,\r\nwithout even tendering him half a crown for supper and lodging!\r\n\r\nYou laugh at me for giving a penny (to be accurate, though, thou\r\nshouldst have said sixpence) to an old fellow, whom thou, in thy high\r\nflight, wouldst have sent home supperless, because he was like Solon or\r\nBelisarius. But you forget that the affront descended like a benediction\r\ninto the pouch of the old gaberlunzie, who overflowed in blessings upon\r\nthe generous donor--long ere he would have thanked thee, Darsie, for\r\nthy barren veneration of his beard and his bearing. Then you laugh at\r\nmy good father\'s retreat from Falkirk, just as if it were not time for a\r\nman to trudge when three or four mountain knaves, with naked claymores,\r\nand heels as light as their fingers, were scampering after him, crying\r\nFURINISH. You remember what he said himself when the Laird of Bucklivat\r\ntold him that FURINISH signified \'stay a while\'. \'What the devil,\'\r\nhe said, surprised out of his Presbyterian correctness by the\r\nunreasonableness of such a request under the circumstances, \'would the\r\nscoundrels have had me stop to have my head cut off?\'\r\n\r\nImagine such a train at your own heels, Darsie, and ask yourself whether\r\nyou would not exert your legs as fast as you did in flying from the\r\nSolway tide. And yet you impeach my father\'s courage. I tell you he has\r\ncourage enough to do what is right, and to spurn what is wrong--courage\r\nenough to defend a righteous cause with hand and purse, and to take\r\nthe part of the poor man against his oppressor, without fear of the\r\nconsequences to himself. This is civil courage, Darsie; and it is of\r\nlittle consequence to most men in this age and country whether they ever\r\npossess military courage or no.\r\n\r\nDo not think I am angry with you, though I thus attempt to rectify your\r\nopinions on my father\'s account. I am well aware that, upon the whole,\r\nhe is scarce regarded with more respect by me than by thee. And, while\r\nI am in a serious humour, which it is difficult to preserve with one who\r\nis perpetually tempting me to laugh at him, pray, dearest Darsie, let\r\nnot thy ardour for adventure carry thee into more such scrapes as that\r\nof the Solway Sands. The rest of the story is a mere imagination; but\r\nthat stormy evening might have proved, as the clown says to Lear, \'a\r\nnaughty night to swim in.\'\r\n\r\nAs for the rest, if you can work mysterious and romantic heroes out of\r\nold cross-grained fishermen, why, I for one will reap some amusement by\r\nthe metamorphosis. Yet hold! even there, there is some need of caution.\r\nThis same female chaplain--thou sayest so little of her, and so much of\r\nevery one else, that it excites some doubt in my mind. VERY PRETTY she\r\nis, it seems--and that is all thy discretion informs me of. There are\r\ncases in which silence implies other things than consent. Wert thou\r\nashamed or afraid, Darsie, to trust thyself with the praises of the very\r\npretty grace-sayer?--As I live, thou blushest! Why, do I not know thee\r\nan inveterate squire of dames? and have I not been in thy confidence?\r\nAn elegant elbow, displayed when the rest of the figure was muffled in a\r\ncardinal, or a neat well-turned ankle and instep, seen by chance as its\r\nowner tripped up the Old Assembly Close, [Of old this almost deserted\r\nalley formed the most common access betwixt the High Street and the\r\nsouthern suburbs.] turned thy brain for eight days. Thou wert once\r\ncaught if I remember rightly, with a single glance of a single matchless\r\neye, which, when the fair owner withdrew her veil, proved to be single\r\nin the literal sense of the word. And, besides, were you not another\r\ntime enamoured of a voice--a mere voice, that mingled in the psalmody at\r\nthe Old Greyfriars\' Church--until you discovered the proprietor of that\r\ndulcet organ to be Miss Dolly MacIzzard, who is both \'back and breast\',\r\nas our saying goes?\r\n\r\nAll these things considered, and contrasted with thy artful silence on\r\nthe subject of this grace-saying Nereid of thine, I must beg thee to be\r\nmore explicit upon that subject in thy next, unless thou wouldst have me\r\nform the conclusion that thou thinkest more of her than thou carest to\r\ntalk of.\r\n\r\nYou will not expect much news from this quarter, as you know the\r\nmonotony of my life, and are aware it must at present be devoted to\r\nuninterrupted study. You have said a thousand times that I am only\r\nqualified to make my way by dint of plodding, and therefore plod I must.\r\n\r\nMy father seems to be more impatient of your absence than he was after\r\nyour first departure. He is sensible, I believe, that our solitary meals\r\nwant the light which your gay humour was wont to throw over them, and\r\nfeels melancholy as men do when the light of the sun is no longer upon\r\nthe landscape. If it is thus with him, thou mayst imagine it is much\r\nmore so with me, and canst conceive how heartily I wish that thy frolic\r\nwere ended, and thou once more our inmate.----\r\n\r\nI resume my pen, after a few hours\' interval, to say that an incident\r\nhas occurred on which you will yourself be building a hundred castles\r\nin the air, and which even I, jealous as I am of such baseless fabrics,\r\ncannot but own affords ground for singular conjecture.\r\n\r\nMy father has of late taken me frequently along with him when he\r\nattends the courts, in his anxiety to see me properly initiated into the\r\npractical forms of business. I own I feel something on his account\r\nand my own from this over-anxiety, which, I dare say, renders us both\r\nridiculous. But what signifies my repugnance? my father drags me up to\r\nhis counsel learned in the law,--\'Are you quite ready to come on to-day,\r\nMr. Crossbite?--This is my son, designed for the bar--I take the liberty\r\nto bring him with me to-day to the consultation, merely that he may see\r\nhow these things are managed.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Crossbite smiles and bows; as a lawyer smiles on the solicitor who\r\nemploys him, and I dare say, thrusts his tongue into his cheek, and\r\nwhispers into the first great wig that passes him, \'What the d--l does\r\nold Fairford mean by letting loose his whelp on me?\'\r\n\r\nAs I stood beside them, too much vexed at the childish part I was made\r\nto play to derive much information from the valuable arguments of Mr.\r\nCrossbite, I observed a rather elderly man, who stood with his eyes\r\nfirmly bent on my father, as if he only waited an end of the business in\r\nwhich he was engaged, to address him. There was something, I thought, in\r\nthe gentleman\'s appearance which commanded attention. Yet his dress was\r\nnot in the present taste, and though it had once been magnificent, was\r\nnow antiquated and unfashionable. His coat was of branched velvet, with\r\na satin lining, a waistcoat of violet-coloured silk, much embroidered;\r\nhis breeches the same stuff as the coat. He wore square-toed shoes, with\r\nforetops, as they are called; and his silk stockings were rolled up over\r\nhis knee, as you may have seen in pictures, and here and there on some\r\nof those originals who seem to pique themselves on dressing after the\r\nmode of Methuselah. A CHAPEAU BRAS and sword necessarily completed his\r\nequipment, which, though out of date, showed that it belonged to a man\r\nof distinction.\r\n\r\nThe instant Mr. Crossbite had ended what he had to say, this gentleman\r\nwalked up to my father, with, \'Your servant, Mr. Fairford--it is long\r\nsince you and I met.\'\r\n\r\nMy father, whose politeness, you know, is exact and formal, bowed, and\r\nhemmed, and was confused, and at length professed that the distance\r\nsince they had met was so great, that though he remembered the face\r\nperfectly, the name, he was sorry to any, had--really--somehow--escaped\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\n\'Have you forgot Herries of Birrenswork?\' said the gentleman, and\r\nmy father bowed even more profoundly than before; though I think his\r\nreception of his old friend seemed to lose some of the respectful\r\ncivility which he bestowed on him while his name was yet unknown. It now\r\nseemed to be something like the lip-courtesy which the heart would have\r\ndenied had ceremony permitted.\r\n\r\nMy father, however, again bowed low, and hoped he saw him well.\r\n\r\n\'So well, my good Mr. Fairford, that I come hither determined to renew\r\nmy acquaintance with one or two old friends, and with you in the first\r\nplace. I halt at my old resting place--you must dine with me to-day,\r\nat Paterson\'s, at the head of the Horse Wynd--it is near your new\r\nfashionable dwelling, and I have business with you.\'\r\n\r\nMy father excused himself respectfully, and not without\r\nembarrassment--\'he was particularly engaged at home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I will dine with you, man,\' said Mr. Herries of Birrenswork; \'the\r\nfew minutes you can spare me after dinner will suffice for my business;\r\nand I will not prevent you a moment from minding your own--I am no\r\nbottle-man.\'\r\n\r\nYou have often remarked that my father, though a scrupulous ohserver of\r\nthe rites of hospitality, seems to exercise them rather as a duty than\r\nas a pleasure; indeed, but for a conscientious wish to feed the hungry\r\nand receive the stranger, his doors would open to guests much seldomer\r\nthan is the case. I never saw so strong an example of this peculiarity\r\n(which I should otherwise have said is caricatured in your description)\r\nas in his mode of homologating the self-given invitation of Mr. Herries.\r\nThe embarsassed brow, and the attempt at a smile which accompanied\r\nhis \'We will expect the honour of seeing you in Brown Square at three\r\no\'clock,\' could not deceive any one, and did not impose upon the old\r\nlaird. It was with a look of scorn that he replied, \'I will relieve you\r\nthen till that hour, Mr. Fairford;\' and his whole manner seemed to say,\r\n\'It is my pleasure to dine with you, and I care not whether I am welcome\r\nor no.\'\r\n\r\nWhen he turned away, I asked my father who he was.\r\n\r\n\'An unfortunate gentleman,\' was the reply.\r\n\r\n\'He looks pretty well on his misfortunes,\' replied I. \'I should not have\r\nsuspected that so gay an outside was lacking a dinner.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who told you that he does?\' replied my father; \'he is OMNI SUSPICIONE\r\nMAJOR, so far as worldly circumstances are concerned. It is to be hoped\r\nhe makes a good use of them; though, if he does, it will be for the\r\nfirst time in his life.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has then been an irregular liver?\' insinuated I.\r\n\r\nMy father replied by that famous brocard with which he silences all\r\nunacceptable queries turning in the slightest degree upon the failings\r\nof our neighbours,--\'If we mend our own faults, Alan, we shall all of us\r\nhave enough to do, without sitting in judgement upon other folks.\'\r\n\r\nHere I was again at fault; but rallying once more, I observed, he had\r\nthe air of a man of high rank and family.\r\n\r\n\'He is well entitled,\' said my father, \'representing Herries of\r\nBirrenswork; a branch of that great and once powerful family of Herries,\r\nthe elder branch whereof merged in the house of Nithesdale at the\r\ndeath of Lord Robin the Philosopher, Anno Domini sixteen hundred and\r\nsixty-seven.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has he still,\' said I, \'his patrimonial estate of Birrenswork?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied my father; \'so far back as his father\'s time, it was\r\na mere designation--the property being forfeited by Herbert Herries\r\nfollowing his kinsman the Earl of Derwentwater to the Preston affair in\r\n1715. But they keep up the designation, thinking, doubtless, that their\r\nclaims may be revived in more favourable times for Jacobites and for\r\npopery; and folks who in no way partake of their fantastic capriccios\r\ndo yet allow it to pass unchallenged, EX COMITATE, if not EX\r\nMISERICORDIA.--But were he the Pope and the Pretender both, we must get\r\nsome dinner ready for him, since he has thought fit to offer himself. So\r\nhasten home, my lad, and tell Hannah, Cook Epps, and James Wilkinson, to\r\ndo their best; and do thou look out a pint or two of Maxwell\'s best--it\r\nis in the fifth bin--there are the keys of the wine-cellar. Do not leave\r\nthem in the lock--you know poor James\'s failing, though he is an honest\r\ncreature under all other temptations--and I have but two bottles of the\r\nold brandy left--we must keep it for medicine, Alan.\'\r\n\r\nAway went I--made my preparations--the hour of dinner came, and so did\r\nMr. Herries of Birrenswork.\r\n\r\nIf I had thy power of imagination and description, Darsie, I could make\r\nout a fine, dark, mysterious, Rembrandt-looking portrait of this same\r\nstranger, which should be as far superior to thy fisherman as a shirt\r\nof chain-mail is to a herring-net. I can assure you there is some matter\r\nfor description about him; but knowing my own imperfections, I can only\r\nsay, I thought him eminently disagreeable and ill-bred.--No, ILL-BRED\r\nis not the proper word on the contrary, he appeared to know the rules of\r\ngood-breeding perfectly, and only to think that the rank of the company\r\ndid not require that he should attend to them--a view of the matter\r\ninfinitely more offensive than if his behaviour had been that of\r\nuneducated and proper rudeness. While my father said grace, the laird\r\ndid all but whistle aloud; and when I, at my father\'s desire, returned\r\nthanks, he used his toothpick, as if he had waited that moment for its\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nSo much for Kirk--with King, matters went even worse. My father, thou\r\nknowest, is particularly full of deference to his guests; and in the\r\npresent care, he seemed more than usually desirous to escape every cause\r\nof dispute. He so far compromised his loyalty as to announce merely \'The\r\nKing\' as his first toast after dinner, instead of the emphatic \'King\r\nGeorge\', which is his usual formula. Our guest made a motion with his\r\nglass, so as to pass it over the water-decanter which stood beside him,\r\nand added, \'Over the water.\'\r\n\r\nMy father coloured, but would not seem to hear this. Much more there\r\nwas of careless and disrespectful in the stranger\'s manner and tone of\r\nconversation; so that, though I know my father\'s prejudices in favour\r\nof rank and birth, and though I am aware his otherwise masculine\r\nunderstanding has never entirely shaken off the slavish awe of the great\r\nwhich in his earlier days they had so many modes of commanding, still I\r\ncould hardly excuse him for enduring so much insolence--such it seemed\r\nto be as this self-invited guest was disposed to offer to him at his own\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nOne can endure a traveller in the same carriage, if he treads upon your\r\ntoes by accident, or even through negligence; but it is very different\r\nwhen, knowing that they are rather of a tender description, he continues\r\nto pound away at them with his hoofs. In my poor opinion--and I am a man\r\nof peace--you can, in that case, hardly avoid a declaration of war.\r\n\r\nI believe my father read my thoughts in my eye; for, pulling out his\r\nwatch, he said; \'Half-past four, Alan--you should be in your own room by\r\nthis time--Birrenswork will excuse you.\'\r\n\r\nOur visitor nodded carelessly, and I had no longer any pretence to\r\nremain. But as I left the room, I heard this magnate of Nithesdale\r\ndistinctly mention the name of Latimer. I lingered; but at length a\r\ndirect hint from my father obliged me to withdraw; and when, an hour\r\nafterwards, I was summoned to partake of a cup of tea, our guest had\r\ndeparted. He had business that evening in the High Street, and could not\r\nspare time even to drink tea. I could not help saying, I considered his\r\ndeparture as a relief from incivility. \'What business has he to upbraid\r\nus,\' I said, \'with the change of our dwelling from a more inconvenient\r\nto a better quarter of the town? What was it to him if we chose\r\nto imitate some of the conveniences or luxuries of an English\r\ndwelling-house, instead of living piled up above each other in flats?\r\nHave his patrician birth and aristocratic fortunes given him any right\r\nto censure those who dispose of the fruits of their own industry,\r\naccording to their own pleasure?\'\r\n\r\nMy father took a long pinch of snuff, and replied, \'Very well, Alan;\r\nvery well indeed. I wish Mr. Crossbite or Counsellor Pest had heard\r\nyou; they must have acknowledged that you have a talent for forensic\r\nelocution; and it may not be amiss to try a little declamation at\r\nhome now and then, to gather audacity and keep yourself in breath. But\r\ntouching the subject of this paraffle of words, it\'s not worth a pinch\r\nof tobacco. D\'ye think that I care for Mr. Herries of Birrenswork more\r\nthan any other gentleman who comes here about business, although I do\r\nnot care to go tilting at his throat, because he speaks like a grey\r\ngoose, as he is? But to say no more about him, I want to have Darsie\r\nLatimer\'s present direction; for it is possible I may have to write the\r\nlad a line with my own hand--and yet I do not well know--but give me the\r\ndirection at all events.\'\r\n\r\nI did so, and if you have heard from my father accordingly, you know\r\nmore, probably, about the subject of this letter than I who write it.\r\nBut if you have not, then shall I have discharged a friend\'s duty, in\r\nletting you know that there certainly is something afloat between\r\nthis disagreeable laird and my father, in which you are considerably\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nAdieu! and although I have given thee a subject for waking dreams,\r\nbeware of building a castle too heavy for the foundation; which, in the\r\npresent instance, is barely the word Latimer occurring in a conversation\r\nbetwixt a gentleman of Dumfriesshire and a W.S. of Edinburgh--CAETERA\r\nPRORSUS IGNORO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI\r\n\r\nDARSIE LATIMER TO ALAN FAIRFORD\r\n\r\n(In continuation of Letters III and IV.)\r\n\r\nI told thee I walked out into the open air with my grave and stern\r\nlandlord. I could now see more perfectly than on the preceding night the\r\nsecluded glen in which stood the two or three cottages which appeared to\r\nbe the abode of him and his family.\r\n\r\nIt was so narrow, in proportion to its depth, that no ray of the morning\r\nsun was likely to reach it till it should rise high in the horizon.\r\nLooking up the dell, you saw a brawling brook issuing in foamy haste\r\nfrom a covert of underwood, like a race-horse impatient to arrive at the\r\ngoal; and, if you gazed yet; more earnestly, you might observe part of\r\na high waterfall glimmering through the foliage, and giving occasion,\r\ndoubtless, to the precipitate speed of the brook. Lower down, the\r\nstream became more placid, and opened into a quiet piece of water which\r\nafforded a rude haven to two or three fishermen\'s boats, then lying high\r\nand dry on the sand, the tide being out. Two or three miserable huts\r\ncould be seen beside this little haven, inhabited probably by the owners\r\nof the boats, but inferior in every respect to the establishment of mine\r\nhost, though that was miserable enough.\r\n\r\nI had but a minute or two to make these observations, yet during that\r\nspace my companion showed symptoms of impatience, and more than once\r\nshouted, \'Cristal--Cristal Nixon,\' until the old man of the preceding\r\nevening appeared at the door of one of the neighbouring cottages or\r\nouthouses, leading the strong black horse which I before commemorated,\r\nready bridled and saddled. My conductor made Cristal a sign with his\r\nfinger, and, turning from the cottage door, led the way up the steep\r\npath or ravine which connected the sequestered dell with the open\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHad I been perfectly aware of the character of the road down which I\r\nhad been hurried with so much impetuosity on the preceding evening, I\r\ngreatly question if I should have ventured the descent; for it deserved\r\nno better name than the channel of a torrent, now in a good measure\r\nfilled with water, that dashed in foam and fury into the dell, being\r\nswelled with the rains of the preceding night. I ascended this ugly path\r\nwith some difficulty although on foot, and felt dizzy when I observed,\r\nfrom such traces as the rains had not obliterated, that the horse seemed\r\nalmost to have slid down it upon his haunches the evening before.\r\n\r\nMy host threw himself on his horse\'s back, without placing a foot in the\r\nstirrup--passed me in the perilous ascent, against which he pressed his\r\nsteed as if the animal had had the footing of a wild cat. The water and\r\nmud splashed from his heels in his reckless course, and a few bounds\r\nplaced him on the top of the bank, where I presently joined him, and\r\nfound the horse and rider standing still as a statue; the former\r\npanting and expanding his broad nostrils to the morning wind, the latter\r\nmotionless, with his eye fixed on the first beams of the rising sun,\r\nwhich already began to peer above the eastern horizon and gild the\r\ndistant mountains of Cumberland and Liddesdale.\r\n\r\nHe seemed in a reverie, from which he started at my approach, and,\r\nputting his horse in motion, led the way at a leisurely pace through a\r\nbroken and sandy road, which traversed a waste, level, and uncultivated\r\ntract of downs, intermixed with morass, much like that in the\r\nneighbourhood of my quarters at Shepherd\'s Bush. Indeed, the whole open\r\nground of this district, where it approaches the sea, has, except in a\r\nfew favoured spots, the same uniform and dreary character.\r\n\r\nAdvancing about a hundred yards from the brink of the glen, we gained\r\na still more extensive command of this desolate prospect, which seemed\r\neven more dreary, as contrasted with the opposite shores of Cumberland,\r\ncrossed and intersected by ten thousand lines of trees growing in\r\nhedgerows, shaded with groves and woods of considerable extent, animated\r\nby hamlets and villas, from which thin clouds of smoke already gave sign\r\nof human life and human industry.\r\n\r\nMy conductor had extended his arm, and was pointing the road to\r\nShepherd\'s Bush, when the step of a horse was heard approaching us. He\r\nlooked sharply round, and having observed who was approaching, proceeded\r\nin his instructions to me, planting himself at the same time in the very\r\nmiddle of the path, which, at the place where we halted, had a slough on\r\nthe one side and a sandbank on the other.\r\n\r\nI observed that the rider who approached us slackened his horse\'s pace\r\nfrom a slow trot to a walk, as if desirous to suffer us to proceed, or\r\nat least to avoid passing us at a spot where the difficulty of doing so\r\nmust have brought us very close to each other. You know my old failing,\r\nAlan, and that I am always willing to attend to anything in preference\r\nto the individual who has for the time possession of the conversation.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to this amiable propensity, I was internally speculating\r\nconcerning the cause of the rider keeping aloof from us, when my\r\ncompanion, elevating his deep voice so suddenly and so sternly as at\r\nonce to recall my wandering thoughts, exclaimed, \'In the name of the\r\ndevil, young man, do you think that others have no better use for their\r\ntime than you have, that you oblige me to repeat the same thing to you\r\nthree times over? Do you see, I say, yonder thing at a mile\'s distance,\r\nthat looks like a finger-post, or rather like a gallows? I would it\r\nhad a dreaming fool hanging upon it, as an example to all meditative\r\nmoon-calves!--Yon gibbet-looking pole will guide you to the bridge,\r\nwhere you must pass the large brook; then proceed straight forwards,\r\ntill several roads divide at a cairn. Plague on thee, thou art wandering\r\nagain!\r\n\r\nIt is indeed quite true that at this moment the horseman approached us,\r\nand my attention was again called to him as I made way to let him pass.\r\nHis whole exterior at once showed that he belonged to the Society of\r\nFriends, or, as the world and the world\'s law calls them, Quakers.\r\nA strong and useful iron-grey galloway showed, by its sleek and\r\ngood condition, that the merciful man was merciful to his beast. His\r\naccoutrements were in the usual unostentatious but clean and servicable\r\norder which characterizes these sectaries. His long surtout of dark-grey\r\nsuperfine cloth descended down to the middle of his leg, and was\r\nbuttoned up to his chin, to defend him against the morning air. As\r\nusual, his ample beaver hung down without button or loop, and shaded a\r\ncomely and placid countenance, the gravity of which appeared to contain\r\nsome seasoning of humour, and had nothing in common with the pinched\r\npuritanical air affected by devotees in general. The brow was open and\r\nfree from wrinkles, whether of age or hypocrisy. The eye was clear,\r\ncalm, and considerate, yet appeared to be disturbed by apprehension,\r\nnot to say fear, as, pronouncing the usual salutation of, \'I wish thee a\r\ngood morrow, friend,\' he indicated, by turning his palfrey close to\r\none side of the path, a wish to glide past us with as little trouble as\r\npossible--just as a traveller would choose to pass a mastiff of whose\r\npeaceable intentions he is by no means confident.\r\n\r\nBut my friend, not meaning, perhaps, that he should get off so easily,\r\nput his horse quite across the path, so that, without plunging into the\r\nslough, or scrambling up the bank, the Quaker could not have passed\r\nhim. Neither of these was an experiment without hazard greater than the\r\npassenger seemed willing to incur. He halted, therefore, as if waiting\r\ntill my companion should make way for him; and, as they sat fronting\r\neach other, I could not help thinking that they might have formed no bad\r\nemblem of Peace and War; for although my conductor was unarmed, yet the\r\nwhole of his manner, his stern look, and his upright seat on horseback,\r\nwere entirely those of a soldier in undress, He accosted the Quaker\r\nin these words, \'So ho! friend Joshua, thou art early to the road this\r\nmorning. Has the spirit moved thee and thy righteous brethren to act\r\nwith some honesty, and pull down yonder tide-nets that keep the fish\r\nfrom coming up the river?\'\r\n\r\n\'Surely, friend, not so,\' answered Joshua, firmly, but good-humouredly\r\nat the same time; \'thou canst not expect that our own hands should pull\r\ndown what our purses established. Thou killest the fish with spear,\r\nline, and coble-net; and we, with snares and with nets, which work by\r\nthe ebb and the flow of the tide. Each doth what seems best in his eyes\r\nto secure a share of the blessing which Providence hath bestowed on the\r\nriver, and that within his own bounds. I prithee seek no quarrel against\r\nus, for thou shalt have no wrong at our hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'Be assured I will take none at the hand of any man, whether his hat be\r\ncocked or broad-brimmed,\' answered the fisherman. \'I tell you in fair\r\nterms, Joshua Geddes, that you and your partners are using unlawful\r\ncraft to destroy the fish in the Solway by stake-nets and wears; and\r\nthat we, who fish fairly, and like men, as our fathers did, have daily\r\nand yearly less sport and less profit. Do not think gravity or hypocrisy\r\ncan carry it off as you have done. The world knows you, and we know you.\r\nYou will destroy the salmon which makes the livelihood of fifty poor\r\nfamilies, and then wipe your mouth, and go to make a speech at meeting.\r\nBut do not hope it will last thus. I give you fair warning, we will be\r\nupon you one morning soon, when we will not leave a stake standing in\r\nthe pools of the Solway; and down the tide they shall every one go, and\r\nwell if we do not send a lessee along with them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Friend,\' replied Joshua, with a constrained smile, \'but that I know\r\nthou dost not mean as thou sayst, I would tell thee we are under the\r\nprotection of this country\'s laws; nor do we the less trust to obtain\r\ntheir protection, that our principles permit us not, by any act of\r\nviolent resistance, to protect ourselves.\'\r\n\r\n\'All villainous cant and cowardice,\' exclaimed the fisherman, \'and\r\nassumed merely as a cloak to your hypocritical avarice.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, say not cowardice, my friend,\' answered the Quaker, \'since thou\r\nknowest there may be as much courage in enduring as in acting; and I\r\nwill be judged by this youth, or by any one else, whether there is not\r\nmore cowardice--even in the opinion of that world whose thoughts are the\r\nbreath in thy nostrils--in the armed oppressor who doth injury, than in\r\nthe defenceless and patient sufferer who endureth it with constancy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will change no more words with you on the subject,\' said the\r\nfisherman, who, as if something moved at the last argument which Mr.\r\nGeddes had used, now made room for him to pass forward on his journey.\r\n\'Do not forget, however,\' he added, \'that you have had fair warning,\r\nnor suppose that we will accept of fair words in apology for foul play.\r\nThese nets of yours are unlawful--they spoil our fishings--we will\r\nhave them down at all risks and hazards. I am a man of my word, friend\r\nJoshua.\'\r\n\r\n\'I trust thou art,\' said the Quaker; \'but thou art the rather bound to\r\nbe cautious in rashly affirming what thou wilt never execute. For I tell\r\nthee, friend, that though there is as great a difference between thee\r\nand one of our people as there is between a lion and a sheep, yet I know\r\nand believe thou hast so much of the lion in thee, that thou wouldst\r\nscarce employ thy strength and thy rage upon that which professeth no\r\nmeans of resistance. Report says so much good of thee, at least, if it\r\nsays little more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Time will try,\' answered the fisherman; \'and hark thee, Joshua, before\r\nwe part I will put thee in the way of doing one good deed, which, credit\r\nme, is better than twenty moral speeches. Here is a stranger youth, whom\r\nHeaven has so scantily gifted with brains, that he will bewilder himself\r\nin the Sands, as he did last night, unless thou wilt kindly show him the\r\nway to Shepherd\'s Bush; for I have been in vain endeavouring to make\r\nhim comprehend the road thither. Hast thou so much charity under thy\r\nsimplicity, Quaker, as to do this good turn?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, it is thou, friend,\' answered Joshua, \'that dost lack charity, to\r\nsuppose any one unwilling to do so simple a kindness.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thou art right--I should have remembered it can cost thee nothing.\r\nYoung gentlemen, this pious pattern of primitive simplicity will teach\r\nthee the right way to the Shepherd\'s Bush--aye, and will himself shear\r\nthee like a sheep, if you come to buying and selling with him.\'\r\n\r\nHe then abruptly asked me, how long I intended to remain at Shepherd\'s\r\nBush.\r\n\r\nI replied, I was at present uncertain--as long probably, as I could\r\namuse myself in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\'You are fond of sport?\' he added, in the same tone of brief inquiry.\r\n\r\nI answered in the affirmative, but added, I was totally inexperienced.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps if you reside here for some days,\' he said, \'we may meet again,\r\nand I may have the chance of giving you a lesson.\'\r\n\r\nEre I could express either thanks or assent, he turned short round with\r\na wave of his hand by way of adieu, and rode back to the verge of the\r\ndell from which we had emerged together; and as he remained standing\r\nupon the banks, I could long hear his voice while he shouted down to\r\nthose within its recesses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Quaker and I proceeded on our journey for some time in\r\nsilence; he restraining his sober-minded steed to a pace which might\r\nhave suited a much less active walker than myself, and looking on\r\nme from time to time with an expression of curiosity, mingled with\r\nbenignity. For my part, I cared not to speak first. It happened I had\r\nnever before been in company with one of this particular sect, and,\r\nafraid that in addressing him I might unwittingly infringe upon some\r\nof their prejudices or peculiarities, I patiently remained silent. At\r\nlength he asked me, whether I had been long in the service of the laird,\r\nas men called him.\r\n\r\nI repeated the words \'in his service?\' with such an accent of surprise,\r\nas induced him to say, \'Nay, but, friend, I mean no offence; perhaps I\r\nshould have said in his society--an inmate, I mean, in his house?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am totally unknown to the person from whom we have just parted,\' said\r\nI, \'and our connexion is only temporary. He had the charity to give me\r\nhis guidance from the Sands, and a night\'s harbourage from the tempest.\r\nSo our acquaintance began, and there it is likely to end; for you may\r\nobserve that our friend is by no means apt to encourage familiarity.\'\r\n\r\n\'So little so,\' answered my companion, \'that thy case is, I think, the\r\nfirst in which I ever heard of his receiving any one into his house;\r\nthat is, if thou hast really spent the night there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why should you doubt it?\' replied I; \'there is no motive I can have to\r\ndeceive you, nor is the object worth it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Be not angry with me,\' said the Quaker; \'but thou knowest that thine\r\nown people do not, as we humbly endeavour to do, confine themselves\r\nwithin the simplicity of truth, but employ the language of falsehood,\r\nnot only for profit, but for compliment, and sometimes for mere\r\ndiversion. I have heard various stories of my neighbour; of most of\r\nwhich I only believe a small part, and even then they are difficult to\r\nreconcile with each other. But this being the first time I ever beard\r\nof his receiving a stranger within his dwelling, made me express some\r\ndoubts. I pray thee let them not offend thee.\'\r\n\r\n\'He does not,\' said I, \'appear to possess in much abundance the means\r\nof exercising hospitality, and so may be excused from offering it in\r\nordinary cases.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is to say, friend,\' replied Joshua, \'thou hast supped ill, and\r\nperhaps breakfasted worse. Now my small tenement, called Mount Sharon,\r\nis nearer to us by two miles than thine inn; and although going\r\nthither may prolong thy walk, as taking thee of the straighter road to\r\nShepherd\'s Bush, yet methinks exercise will suit thy youthful limbs,\r\nas well as a good plain meal thy youthful appetite. What sayst thou, my\r\nyoung acquaintance?\'\r\n\r\n\'If it puts you not to inconvenience,\' I replied; for the invitation was\r\ncordially given, and my bread and milk had been hastily swallowed, and\r\nin small quantity.\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' said Joshua, \'use not the language of compliment with those who\r\nrenounce it. Had this poor courtesy been very inconvenient, perhaps I\r\nhad not offered it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I accept the invitation, then,\' said I, \'in the same good spirit in\r\nwhich you give it.\'\r\n\r\nThe Quaker smiled, reached me his hand, I shook it, and we travelled on\r\nin great cordiality with each other. The fact is, I was much entertained\r\nby contrasting in my own mind, the open manner of the kind-hearted\r\nJoshua Geddes, with the abrupt, dark, and lofty demeanour of my\r\nentertainer on the preceding evening. Both were blunt and unceremonious;\r\nbut the plainness of the Quaker had the character of devotional\r\nsimplicity, and was mingled with the more real kindness, as if honest\r\nJoshua was desirous of atoning, by his sincerity, for the lack of\r\nexternal courtesy. On the contrary, the manners of the fisherman were\r\nthose of one to whom the rules of good behaviour might be familiar, but\r\nwho, either from pride or misanthropy, scorned to observe them. Still\r\nI thought of him with interest and curiosity, notwithstanding so much\r\nabout him that was repulsive; and I promised myself, in the course of my\r\nconversation with the Quaker, to learn all that he knew on the subject.\r\nHe turned the conversation, however, into a different channel, and\r\ninquired into my own condition of life, and views in visiting this\r\nremote frontier.\r\n\r\nI only thought it necessary to mention my name, and add, that I had been\r\neducated to the law, but finding myself possessed of some independence,\r\nI had of late permitted myself some relaxation, and was residing at\r\nShepherd\'s Bush to enjoy the pleasure of angling.\r\n\r\n\'I do thee no harm, young man,\' said my new friend, \'in wishing thee a\r\nbetter employment for thy grave hours, and a more humane amusement (if\r\namusement thou must have) for those of a lighter character.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are severe, sir,\' I replied. \'I heard you but a moment since refer\r\nyourself to the protection of the laws of the country--if there be laws,\r\nthere must be lawyers to explain, and judges to administer them.\'\r\n\r\nJoshua smiled, and pointed to the sheep which were grazing on the downs\r\nover which we were travelling. \'Were a wolf,\' he said, \'to come even now\r\nupon yonder flocks, they would crowd for protection, doubtless, around\r\nthe shepherd and his dogs; yet they are bitten and harassed daily by\r\nthe one, shorn, and finally killed and eaten by the other. But I say not\r\nthis to shock you; for, though laws and lawyers are evils, yet they are\r\nnecessary evils in this probationary state of society, till man shall\r\nlearn to render unto his fellows that which is their due, according\r\nto the light of his own conscience, and through no other compulsion.\r\nMeanwhile, I have known many righteous men who have followed thy\r\nintended profession in honesty and uprightness of walk. The greater\r\ntheir merit, who walk erect in a path which so many find slippery.\r\n\r\n\'And angling,\' said I:--\'you object to that also as an amusement,\r\nyou who, if I understood rightly what passed between you and my late\r\nlandlord, are yourself a proprietor of fisheries.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a proprietor,\' he replied, \'I am only, in copartnery with others,\r\na tacksman or lessee of some valuable salmon-fisheries a little down the\r\ncoast. But mistake me not. The evil of angling, with which I class all\r\nsports, as they are called, which have the sufferings of animals for\r\ntheir end and object, does not consist in the mere catching and killing\r\nthose animals with which the bounty of Providence hath stocked the earth\r\nfor the good of man, but in making their protracted agony a principle of\r\ndelight and enjoyment. I do indeed cause these fisheries to be conducted\r\nfor the necessary taking, killing, and selling the fish; and, in the\r\nsame way, were I a farmer, I should send my lambs to market. But I\r\nshould as soon think of contriving myself a sport and amusement out of\r\nthe trade of the butcher as out of that of the fisher.\'\r\n\r\nWe argued the point no further; for though I thought his arguments a\r\nlittle too high-strained, yet as my mind acquitted me of having taken\r\ndelight in aught but the theory of field-sports, I did not think myself\r\ncalled upon stubbornly to advocate a practice which had afforded me so\r\nlittle pleasure.\r\n\r\nWe had by this time arrived at the remains of an old finger-post, which\r\nmy host had formerly pointed out as a landmark. Here, a ruinous wooden\r\nbridge, supported by long posts resembling crutches, served me to get\r\nacross the water, while my new friend sought a ford a good way higher\r\nup, for the stream was considerably swelled.\r\n\r\nAs I paused for his rejoining me, I observed an angler at a little\r\ndistance pouching trout after trout, as fast almost as he could cast his\r\nline; and I own, in spite of Joshua\'s lecture on humanity, I could not\r\nbut envy his adroitness and success, so natural is the love of sport\r\nto our minds, or so easily are we taught to assimilate success in\r\nfield-sports with ideas of pleasure, and with the praise due to address\r\nand agility. I soon recognized in the successful angler little Benjie,\r\nwho had been my guide and tutor in that gentle art, as you have learned\r\nfrom my former letters. I called--I whistled--the rascal recognized me,\r\nand, starting like a guilty thing, seemed hesitating whether to approach\r\nor to run away; and when he determined on the former, it was to assail\r\nme with a loud, clamorous, and exaggerated report of the anxiety of all\r\nat the Shepherd\'s Bush for my personal safety; how my landlady had wept,\r\nhow Sam and the ostler had not the heart to go to bed, but sat up all\r\nnight drinking--and how he himself had been up long before daybreak to\r\ngo in quest of me.\r\n\r\n\'And you were switching the water, I suppose,\' said I, \'to discover my\r\ndead body?\'\r\n\r\nThis observation produced a long \'Na--a--a\' of acknowledged detection;\r\nbut, with his natural impudence, and confidence in my good nature, he\r\nimmediately added, \'that he thought I would like a fresh trout or twa\r\nfor breakfast, and the water being in such a rare trim for the saumon\r\nraun, [The bait made of salmon-roe salted and preserved. In a swollen\r\nriver, and about the month of October, it is a most deadly bait.] he\r\ncouldna help taking a cast.\'\r\n\r\nWhile we were engaged in this discussion, the honest Quaker returned to\r\nthe farther end of the wooden bridge to tell me he could not venture to\r\ncross the brook in its present state: but would be under the necessity\r\nto ride round by the stone bridge, which was a mile and a half higher\r\nup than his own house. He was about to give me directions how to proceed\r\nwithout him, and inquire for his sister, when I suggested to him that,\r\nif he pleased to trust his horse to little Benjie, the boy might carry\r\nhim round by the bridge, while we walked the shorter and more pleasant\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nJoshua shook his head, for he was well acquainted with Benjie, who,\r\nhe said, was the naughtiest varlet in the whole neighbourhood.\r\nNevertheless, rather than part company, he agreed to put the pony under\r\nhis charge for a short season, with many injunctions that he should not\r\nattempt to mount, but lead the pony (even Solomon) by the bridle, under\r\nthe assurances of sixpence in case of proper demeanour, and penalty that\r\nif he transgressed the orders given him, \'verily he would be scourged.\'\r\n\r\nPromises cost Benjie nothing, and he showered them out wholesale;\r\ntill the Quaker at length yielded up the bridle to him, repeating his\r\ncharges, and enforcing them by holding up his forefinger. On my part, I\r\ncalled to Benjie to leave the fish he had taken at Mount Sharon, making,\r\nat the same time, an apologetic countenance to my new friend, not\r\nbeing quite aware whether the compliment would be agreeable to such a\r\ncondemner of field-sports.\r\n\r\nHe understood me at once, and reminded me of the practical distinction\r\nbetwixt catching the animals as an object of cruel and wanton sport, and\r\neating them as lawful and gratifying articles of food, after they were\r\nkilled. On the latter point he had no scruples; but, on the contrary,\r\nassured me that this brook contained the real red trout, so highly\r\nesteemed by all connoisseurs, and that, when eaten within an hour\r\nof their being caught, they had a peculiar firmness of substance and\r\ndelicacy of flavour, which rendered them an agreeable addition to a\r\nmorning meal, especially when earned, like ours, by early rising, and an\r\nhour or two\'s wholesome exercise.\r\n\r\nBut to thy alarm be it spoken, Alan, we did not come so far as the\r\nfrying of our fish without further adventure. So it is only to spare thy\r\npatience, and mine own eyes, that I pull up for the present, and send\r\nthee the rest of my story in a subsequent letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SAME TO THE SAME (In continuation.)\r\n\r\nLittle Benjie, with the pony, having been sent off on the left side of\r\nthe brook, the Quaker and I sauntered on, like the cavalry and infantry\r\nof the same army occupying the opposite banks of a river, and observing\r\nthe same line of march. But, while my worthy companion was assuring me\r\nof a pleasant greensward walk to his mansion, little Benjie, who had\r\nbeen charged to keep in sight, chose to deviate from the path assigned\r\nhim, and, turning to the right, led his charge, Solomon, out of our\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n\'The villain means to mount him!\' cried Joshua, with more vivacity than\r\nwas consistent with his profession of passive endurance.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to appease his apprehensions, as he pushed on, wiping his\r\nbrow with vexation, assuring him that, if the boy did mount, he would,\r\nfor his own sake, ride gently.\r\n\r\n\'You do not know him,\' said Joshua, rejecting all consolation; \'HE do\r\nanything gently!--no, he will gallop Solomon--he will misuse the sober\r\npatience of the poor animal who has borne me so long! Yes, I was given\r\nover to my own devices when I ever let him touch the bridle, for such a\r\nlittle miscreant there never was before him in this country.\'\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to expatiate on every sort of rustic enormity of which\r\nhe accused Benjie. He had been suspected of snaring partridges--was\r\ndetected by Joshua himself in liming singing-birds--stood fully charged\r\nwith having worried several cats, by aid of a lurcher which attended\r\nhim, and which was as lean, and ragged, and mischievous, as his master.\r\nFinally, Benjie stood accused of having stolen a duck, to hunt it with\r\nthe said lurcher, which was as dexterous on water as on land. I chimed\r\nin with my friend, in order to avoid giving him further irritation, and\r\ndeclared I should be disposed, from my own experience, to give up Benjie\r\nas one of Satan\'s imps. Joshua Geddes began to censure the phrase as\r\ntoo much exaggerated, and otherwise unbecoming the mouth of a reflecting\r\nperson; and, just as I was apologizing for it, as being a term of common\r\nparlance, we heard certain sounds on the opposite side of the brook,\r\nwhich seemed to indicate that Solomon and Benjie were at issue together.\r\nThe sandhills behind which Benjie seemed to take his course, had\r\nconcealed from us, as doubtless he meant they should, his ascent into\r\nthe forbidden saddle, and, putting Solomon to his mettle, which he was\r\nseldom called upon to exert, they had cantered away together in\r\ngreat amity, till they came near to the ford from which the palfrey\'s\r\nlegitimate owner had already turned back.\r\n\r\nHere a contest of opinions took place between the horse and his rider.\r\nThe latter, according to his instructions, attempted to direct Solomon\r\ntowards the distant bridge of stone; but Solomon opined that the ford\r\nwas the shortest way to his own stable. The point was sharply contested,\r\nand we heard Benjie gee-hupping, tchek-tcheking, and, above all,\r\nflogging in great style; while Solomon, who, docile in his general\r\nhabits, was now stirred beyond his patience, made a great trampling and\r\nrecalcitration; and it was their joint noise which we heard, without\r\nbeing able to see, though Joshua might too well guess, the cause of it.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at these indications, the Quaker began to shout out,\r\n\'Benjie--thou varlet! Solomon--thou fool!\' when the couple presented\r\nthemselves in full drive, Solomon having now decidedly obtained the\r\nbetter of the conflict, and bringing his unwilling rider in high career\r\ndown to the ford. Never was there anger changed so fast into humane\r\nfear, as that of my good companion. \'The varlet will be drowned!\' he\r\nexclaimed--\'a widow\'s son!--her only son!--and drowned!--let me go\'--And\r\nhe struggled with me stoutly as I hung upon him, to prevent him from\r\nplunging into the ford.\r\n\r\nI had no fear whatever for Benjie; for the blackguard vermin, though he\r\ncould not manage the refractory horse, stuck on his seat like a monkey.\r\nSolomon and Benjie scrambled through the ford with little inconvenience,\r\nand resumed their gallop on the other side.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to guess whether on this last occasion Benjie was\r\nrunning off with Solomon, or Solomon with Benjie; but, judging from\r\ncharacter and motives, I rather suspected the former. I could not help\r\nlaughing as the rascal passed me, grinning betwixt terror and delight,\r\nperched on the very pommel of the saddle, and holding with extended arms\r\nby bridle and mane while Solomon, the bit secured between his teeth,\r\nand his head bored down betwixt his forelegs, passed his master in this\r\nunwonted guise as hard as he could pelt.\r\n\r\n\'The mischievous bastard!\' exclaimed the Quaker, terrified out of his\r\nusual moderation of speech--\'the doomed gallows-bird!--he will break\r\nSolomon\'s wind to a certainty.\'\r\n\r\nI prayed him to be comforted--assured, him a brushing gallop would do\r\nhis favourite no harm and reminded him of the censure he had bestowed on\r\nme a minute before, for applying a harsh epithet to the boy.\r\n\r\nBut Joshua was not without his answer; \'Friend youth,\' he said, \'thou\r\ndidst speak of the lad\'s soul, which thou didst affirm belonged to the\r\nenemy, and of that thou couldst say nothing of thine own knowledge; on\r\nthe contrary, I did but speak of his outward man, which will assuredly\r\nbe suspended by a cord, if he mendeth not his manners. Men say that,\r\nyoung as he is, he is one of the laird\'s gang.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of the laird\'s gang!\' said I, repeating the words in surprise. \'Do you\r\nmean the person with whom I slept last night? I heard you call him the\r\nlaird. Is he at the head of a gang?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, I meant not precisely a gang,\' said the Quaker, who appeared in\r\nhis haste to have spoken more than he intended--a company, or party, I\r\nshould have said; but thus it is, friend Latimer, with the wisest men\r\nwhen they permit themselves to be perturbed with passion, and speak as\r\nin a fever, or as with the tongue of the foolish and the forward. And\r\nalthough thou hast been hasty to mark my infirmity, yet I grieve not\r\nthat thou hast been a witness to it, seeing that the stumbles of the\r\nwise may be no less a caution to youth and inexperience, than is the\r\nfall of the foolish.\'\r\n\r\nThis was a sort of acknowledgement of what I had already begun to\r\nsuspect--that my new friend\'s real goodness of disposition, joined to\r\nthe acquired quietism of his religious sect, had been unable entirely to\r\ncheck the effervescence of a temper naturally warm and hasty.\r\n\r\nUpon the present occasion, as if sensible he had displayed a greater\r\ndegree of emotion than became his character, Joshua avoided further\r\nallusion to Benjie and Solomon, and proceeded to solicit my attention to\r\nthe natural objects around us, which increased in beauty and interest,\r\nas, still conducted by the meanders of the brook, we left the common\r\nbehind us, and entered a more cultivated and enclosed country, where\r\narable and pasture ground was agreeably varied with groves and hedges.\r\nDescending now almost close to the stream, our course lay through a\r\nlittle gate, into a pathway kept with great neatness, the sides of which\r\nwere decorated with trees and flowering shrubs of the hardier species;\r\nuntil, ascending by a gentle slope, we issued from the grove, and stood\r\nalmost at once in front of a low but very neat building, of an irregular\r\nform; and my guide, shaking me cordially by the hand, made me welcome to\r\nMount Sharon.\r\n\r\nThe wood through which we had approached this little mansion was thrown\r\naround it both on the north and north-west, but, breaking off into\r\ndifferent directions, was intersected by a few fields well watered and\r\nsheltered. The house fronted to the south-east, and from thence the\r\npleasure-ground, or, I should rather say, the gardens, sloped down\r\nto the water. I afterwards understood that the father of the present\r\nproprietor had a considerable taste for horticulture, which had been\r\ninherited by his son, and had formed these gardens, which, with their\r\nshaven turf, pleached alleys, wildernesses, and exotic trees and shrubs,\r\ngreatly excelled anything of the kind which had been attempted in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIf there was a little vanity in the complacent smile with which Joshua\r\nGeddes saw me gaze with delight on a scene so different from the naked\r\nwaste we had that day traversed in company, it might surely be permitted\r\nto one who, cultivating and improving the beauties of nature, had found\r\ntherein, as he said, bodily health, and a pleasing relaxation for the\r\nmind. At the bottom of the extended gardens the brook wheeled round in a\r\nwide semicircle, and was itself their boundary. The opposite side was\r\nno part of Joshua\'s domain, but the brook was there skirted by a\r\nprecipitous rock of limestone, which seemed a barrier of nature\'s own\r\nerecting around his little Eden of beauty, comfort, and peace.\r\n\r\n\'But I must not let thee forget,\' said the kind Quaker, \'amidst thy\r\nadmiration of these beauties of our little inheritance, that thy\r\nbreakfast has been a light one.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, Joshua conducted me to a small sashed door, opening under\r\na porch amply mantled by honeysuckle and clematis, into a parlour\r\nof moderate size; the furniture of which, in plainness and excessive\r\ncleanliness, bore the characteristic marks of the sect to which the\r\nowner belonged.\r\n\r\nThy father\'s Hannah is generally allowed to be an exception to all\r\nScottish housekeepers, and stands unparalleled for cleanliness among\r\nthe women of Auld Reekie; but the cleanliness of Hannah is sluttishness\r\ncompared to the scrupulous purifications of these people, who seem to\r\ncarry into the minor decencies of life that conscientious rigour which\r\nthey affect in their morals.\r\n\r\nThe parlour would have been gloomy, for the windows were small and the\r\nceiling low; but the present proprietor had rendered it more cheerful\r\nby opening one end into a small conservatory, roofed with glass, and\r\ndivided from the parlour by a partition of the same. I have never before\r\nseen this very pleasing manner of uniting the comforts of an apartment\r\nwith the beauties of a garden, and I wonder it is not more practised\r\nby the great. Something of the kind is hinted at in a paper of the\r\nSPECTATOR.\r\n\r\nAs I walked towards the conservatory to view it more closely, the\r\nparlour chimney engaged my attention. It was a pile of massive stone,\r\nentirely out of proportion to the size of the apartment. On the front\r\nhad once been an armorial scutcheon; for the hammer, or chisel, which\r\nhad been employed to deface the shield or crest, had left uninjured\r\nthe scroll beneath, which bore the pious motto, \'TRUST IN GOD.\'\r\nBlack-letter, you know, was my early passion, and the tombstones in the\r\nGreyfriars\' churchyard early yielded up to my knowledge as a decipherer\r\nwhat little they could tell of the forgotten dead.\r\n\r\nJoshua Geddes paused when he saw my eye fixed on this relic of\r\nantiquity. \'Thou canst read it?\' he said.\r\n\r\nI repeated the motto, and added, there seemed vestiges of a date.\r\n\r\n\'It should be 1537,\' said he; \'for so long ago, at the least\r\ncomputation, did my ancestors, in the blinded times of Papistry, possess\r\nthese lands, and in that year did they build their house.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is an ancient descent,\' said I, looking with respect upon the\r\nmonument. \'I am sorry the arms have been defaced.\'\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps impossible for my friend, Quaker as he was, to seem\r\naltogether void of respect for the pedigree which he began to recount\r\nto me, disclaiming all the while the vanity usually connected with\r\nthe subject; in short, with the air of mingled melancholy, regret, and\r\nconscious dignity, with which Jack Fawkes used to tell us at college of\r\nhis ancestor\'s unfortunate connexion with the Gunpowder Plot.\r\n\r\n\'Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher,\' thus harangued Joshua Gleddes\r\nof Mount Sharon; \'if we ourselves are nothing in the sight of Heaven,\r\nhow much less than nothing must be our derivation from rotten bones and\r\nmouldering dust, whose immortal spirits have long since gone to their\r\nprivate account? Yes, friend Latimer, my ancestors were renowned among\r\nthe ravenous and bloodthirsty men who then dwelt in this vexed country;\r\nand so much were they famed for successful freebooting, robbery, and\r\nbloodshed, that they are said to have been called Geddes, as likening\r\nthem to the fish called a Jack, Pike, or Luce, and in our country\r\ntongue, a GED--a goodly distinction truly for Christian men! Yet did\r\nthey paint this shark of the fresh waters upon their shields, and these\r\nprofane priests of a wicked idolatry, the empty boasters called heralds,\r\nwho make engraven images of fishes, fowls, and four-footed beasts, that\r\nmen may fall down and worship them, assigned the ged for the device and\r\nescutcheon of my fathers, and hewed it over their chimneys, and placed\r\nit above their tombs; and the men were elated in mind, and became yet\r\nmore ged-like, slaying, leading into captivity, and dividing the spoil,\r\nuntil the place where they dwelt obtained the name of Sharing-Knowe,\r\nfrom the booty which was there divided amongst them and their\r\naccomplices. But a better judgement was given to my father\'s father,\r\nPhilip Geddes, who, after trying to light his candle at some of the vain\r\nwildfires then held aloft at different meetings and steeple-houses, at\r\nlength obtained a spark from the lamp of the blessed George Fox, who\r\ncame into Scotland spreading light among darkness, as he himself hath\r\nwritten, as plentifully as fly the sparkles from the hoof of the horse\r\nwhich gallops swiftly along the stony road.\'--Here the good Quaker\r\ninterrupted himself with, \'And that is very true, I must go speedily to\r\nsee after the condition of Solomon.\'\r\n\r\nA Quaker servant here entered the room with a tray, and inclining his\r\nhead towards his master, but not after the manner of one who bows, said\r\ncomposedly, \'Thou art welcome home, friend Joshua, we expected thee not\r\nso early; but what hath befallen Solomon thy horse?\'\r\n\r\n\'What hath befallen him, indeed?\' said my friend; \'hath he not been\r\nreturned hither by the child whom they call Benjie?\'\r\n\r\n\'He hath,\' said his domestic, \'but it was after a strange fashion; for\r\nhe came hither at a swift and furious pace, and flung the child Benjie\r\nfrom his back, upon the heap of dung which is in the stable-yard.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad of it,\' said Joshua, hastily,--\'glad of it, with all my heart\r\nand spirit! But stay, he is the child of the widow--hath the boy any\r\nhurt?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not so\' answered the servant, \'for he rose and fled swiftly.\'\r\n\r\nJoshua muttered something about a scourge, and then inquired after\r\nSolomon\'s present condition.\r\n\r\n\'He seetheth like a steaming cauldron,\' answered the servant; \'and\r\nBauldie, the lad, walketh him about the yard with a halter, lest he take\r\ncold.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Geddes hastened to the stable-yard to view personally the condition\r\nof his favourite, and I followed to offer my counsel as a jockey. Don\'t\r\nlaugh, Alan, sure I have jockeyship enough to assist a Quaker--in this\r\nunpleasing predicament.\r\n\r\nThe lad who was leading the horse seemed to be no Quaker, though his\r\nintercourse with the family had given him a touch of their prim sobriety\r\nof look and manner. He assured Joshua that his horse had received no\r\ninjury, and I even hinted that the exercise would be of service to him.\r\nSolomon himself neighed towards his master, and rubbed his head against\r\nthe good Quaker\'s shoulder, as if to assure him of his being quite well;\r\nso that Joshua returned in comfort to his parlour, where breakfast was\r\nnow about to be displayed.\r\n\r\nI have since learned that the affection of Joshua for his pony is\r\nconsidered as inordinate by some of his own sect; and that he has been\r\nmuch blamed for permitting it to be called by the name of Solomon, or\r\nany other name whatever; but he has gained so much respect and influence\r\namong them that they overlook these foibles.\r\n\r\nI learned from him (whilst the old servant, Jehoiachim, entering and\r\nre-entering, seemed to make no end of the materials which he brought in\r\nfor breakfast) that his grandfather Philip, the convert of George Fox,\r\nhad suffered much from the persecution to which these harmless devotees\r\nwere subjected on all sides during that intolerant period, and much\r\nof their family estate had been dilapidated. But better days dawned\r\non Joshua\'s father, who, connecting himself by marriage with a wealthy\r\nfamily of Quakers in Lancashire, engaged successfully in various\r\nbranches of commerce, and redeemed the remnants of the property,\r\nchanging its name in sense, without much alteration of sound, from the\r\nBorder appellation of Sharing-Knowe, to the evangelical appellation of\r\nMount Sharon.\r\n\r\nThis Philip Geddes, as I before hinted, had imbibed the taste for\r\nhorticulture and the pursuits of the florist, which are not uncommon\r\namong the peaceful sect he belonged to. He had destroyed the remnants\r\nof the old peel-house, substituting the modern mansion in its place;\r\nand while he reserved the hearth of his ancestors, in memory of their\r\nhospitality, as also the pious motto which they had chanced to assume,\r\nhe failed not to obliterate the worldly and military emblems displayed\r\nupon the shield and helmet, together with all their blazonry.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes after Mr. Geddes had concluded the account; of himself\r\nand his family, his sister Rachel, the only surviving member of it,\r\nentered the room. Her appearance is remarkably pleasing, and although\r\nher age is certainly thirty at least, she still retains the shape and\r\nmotion of an earlier period. The absence of everything like fashion\r\nor ornament was, as usual, atoned for by the most perfect neatness and\r\ncleanliness of her dress; and her simple close cap was particularly\r\nsuited to eyes which had the softness and simplicity of the dove\'s.\r\nHer features were also extremely agreeable, but had suffered a little\r\nthrough the ravages of that professed enemy to beauty, the small-pox; a\r\ndisadvantage which was in part counterbalanced by a well-formed mouth,\r\nteeth like pearls, and a pleasing sobriety of smile, that seemed to wish\r\ngood here and hereafter to every one she spoke to. You cannot make\r\nany of your vile inferences here, Alan, for I have given a full-length\r\npicture of Rachel Geddes; so that; you cannot say, in this case, as in\r\nthe letter I have just received, that she was passed over as a subject\r\non which I feared to dilate. More of this anon.\r\n\r\nWell, we settled to our breakfast after a blessing, or rather an\r\nextempore prayer, which Joshua made upon the occasion, and which\r\nthe spirit moved him to prolong rather more than I felt altogether\r\nagreeable. Then, Alan, there was such a dispatching of the good things\r\nof the morning as you have not witnessed since you have seen Darsie\r\nLatimer at breakfast. Tea and chocolate, eggs, ham, and pastry, not\r\nforgetting the broiled fish, disappeared with a celerity which seemed\r\nto astonish the good-humoured Quakers, who kept loading my plate\r\nwith supplies, as if desirous of seeing whether they could, by any\r\npossibility, tire me out. One hint, however, I received, which put me in\r\nmind where I was. Miss Geddes had offered me some sweet-cake, which, at\r\nthe moment, I declined; but presently afterwards, seeing it within\r\nmy reach, I naturally enough helped myself to a slice, and had just;\r\ndeposited it beside my plate, when Joshua, mine host, not with the\r\nauthoritative air of Sancho\'s doctor, Tirteafuera, but in a very calm\r\nand quiet manner, lifted it away and replaced it on the dish, observing\r\nonly, \'Thou didst refuse it before, friend Latimer.\'\r\n\r\nThese good folks, Alan, make no allowance for what your good father\r\ncalls the Aberdeen-man\'s privilege, of \'taking his word again;\' or what\r\nthe wise call second thoughts.\r\n\r\nBating this slight hint that I was among a precise generation, there\r\nwas nothing in my reception that was peculiar--unless, indeed, I were to\r\nnotice the solicitous and uniform kindness with which all the attentions\r\nof my new friends were seasoned, as if they were anxious to assure me\r\nthat the neglect of worldly compliments interdicted by their sect, only\r\nserved to render their hospitality more sincere. At length my hunger was\r\nsatisfied, and the worthy Quaker, who, with looks of great good nature,\r\nhad watched my progress, thus addressed his sister:--\r\n\r\n\'This young man, Rachel, hath last night sojourned in the tents of our\r\nneighbour whom men call the laird. I am sorry I had not met him the\r\nevening before, for our neighbour\'s hospitality is too unfrequently\r\nexercised to be well prepared with the means of welcome.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, but, Joshua,\' said Rachel, \'if our neighbour hath done a kindness,\r\nthou shouldst not grudge him the opportunity; and if our young friend\r\nhath fared ill for a night, he will the better relish what Providence\r\nmay send him of better provisions.\'\r\n\r\n\'And that he may do so at leisure,\' said Joshua, \'we will pray him,\r\nRachel, to tarry a day or twain with us: he is young, and is but now\r\nentering upon the world, and our habitation may, if he will, be like a\r\nresting-place, from which he may look abroad upon the pilgrimage which\r\nhe must take, and the path which he has to travel.--What sayest thou,\r\nfriend Latimer? We constrain not our friends to our ways, and thou art,\r\nI think, too wise to quarrel with us for following our own fashions; and\r\nif we should even give thee a word of advice, thou wilt not, I think, be\r\nangry, so that it is spoken in season.\'\r\n\r\nYou know, Alan, how easily I am determined by anything resembling\r\ncordiality--and so, though a little afraid of the formality of my host\r\nand hostess, I accepted their invitation, provided I could get some\r\nmessenger to send to Shepherd\'s Bush for my servant and portmanteau.\r\n\r\n\'Why, truly, friend,\' said Joshua, \'thy outward frame would be improved\r\nby cleaner garments; but I will do thine errand myself to the Widow\r\nGregson\'s house of reception, and send thy lad hither with thy clothes.\r\nMeanwhile, Rachel will show thee these little gardens, and then will put\r\nthee in some way of spending thy time usefully, till our meal calls\r\nus together at the second hour after noon. I bid thee farewell for\r\nthe present, having some space to walk, seeing I must leave the animal\r\nSolomon to his refreshing rest.\'\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Joshua Geddes withdrew. Some ladies we have known\r\nwould have felt, or at least affected, reserve or embarrassment, at\r\nbeing left to do the honours of the grounds to (it will be out, Alan)--a\r\nsmart young fellow--an entire stranger. She went out for a few minutes,\r\nand returned in her plain cloak and bonnet, with her beaver gloves,\r\nprepared to act as my guide, with as much simplicity as if she had been\r\nto wait upon thy father. So forth I sallied with my fair Quakeress.\r\n\r\nIf the house at Mount Sharon be merely a plain and convenient dwelling,\r\nof moderate size and small pretensions, the gardens and offices, though\r\nnot extensive, might rival an earl\'s in point of care and expense.\r\nRachel carried me first to her own favourite resort, a poultry-yard,\r\nstocked with a variety of domestic fowls, of the more rare as well as\r\nthe most ordinary kinds, furnished with every accommodation which may\r\nsuit their various habits. A rivulet which spread into a pond for the\r\nconvenience of the aquatic birds, trickled over gravel as it passed\r\nthrough the yards dedicated to the land poultry, which were thus amply\r\nsupplied with the means they use for digestion.\r\n\r\nAll these creatures seemed to recognize the presence of their mistress,\r\nand some especial favourites hastened to her feet, and continued to\r\nfollow her as far as their limits permitted. She pointed out their\r\npeculiarities and qualities, with the discrimination of one who had made\r\nnatural history her study; and I own I never looked on barn-door\r\nfowls with so much interest before--at least until they were boiled\r\nor roasted. I could not help asking the trying question, how she could\r\norder the execution of any of the creatures of which she seemed so\r\ncareful.\r\n\r\n\'It was painful,\' she said, \'but it was according to the law of their\r\nbeing. They must die; but they knew not when death was approaching; and\r\nin making them comfortable while they lived, we contributed to their\r\nhappiness as much as the conditions of their existence permitted to us.\'\r\n\r\nI am not quite of her mind, Alan. I do not believe either pigs or\r\npoultry would admit that the chief end of their being was to be killed\r\nand eaten. However, I did not press the argument, from which my Quaker\r\nseemed rather desirous to escape; for, conducting me to the greenhouse,\r\nwhich was extensive, and filled with the choicest plants, she pointed\r\nout an aviary which occupied the farther end, where, she said, she\r\nemployed herself with attending the inhabitants, without being disturbed\r\nwith any painful recollections concerning their future destination.\r\n\r\nI will not trouble you with any account of the various hot-houses\r\nand gardens, and their contents. No small sum of money must have been\r\nexpended in erecting and maintaining them in the exquisite degree\r\nof good order which they exhibited. The family, I understood, were\r\nconnected with that of the celebrated Millar, and had imbibed his taste\r\nfor flowers, and for horticulture. But instead of murdering botanical\r\nnames, I will rather conduct you to the POLICY, or pleasure-garden,\r\nwhich the taste of Joshua or his father had extended on the banks\r\nbetwixt the house and river. This also, in contradistinction to the\r\nprevailing simplicity, was ornamented in an unusual degree. There were\r\nvarious compartments, the connexion of which was well managed, and\r\nalthough the whole ground did not exceed five or six acres, it was so\r\nmuch varied as to seem four times larger. The space contained close\r\nalleys and open walks; a very pretty artificial waterfall; a fountain\r\nalso, consisting of a considerable jet-d\'eau, whose streams glittered in\r\nthe sunbeams and exhibited a continual rainbow. There was a cabinet of\r\nverdure, as the French call it, to cool the summer heat, and there was\r\na terrace sheltered from the north-east by a noble holly hedge, with all\r\nits glittering spears where you might have the full advantage of the sun\r\nin the clear frosty days of winter.\r\n\r\nI know that you, Alan, will condemn all this as bad and antiquated; for,\r\never since Dodsley has described the Leasowes, and talked of Brown\'s\r\nimitations of nature and Horace Walpole\'s late Essay on Gardening, you\r\nare all for simple nature--condemn walking up and down stairs in the\r\nopen air and declare for wood and wilderness. But NE QUID NIMIS. I would\r\nnot deface a scene of natural grandeur or beauty, by the introduction\r\nof crowded artificial decorations; yet such may, I think, be very\r\ninteresting, where the situation, in its natural state, otherwise has no\r\nparticular charms.\r\n\r\nSo that when I have a country-house (who can say how soon?) you may\r\nlook for grottoes, and cascades, and fountains; nay if you vex me by\r\ncontradiction, perhaps I may go the length of a temple--so provoke me\r\nnot, for you see of what enormities I am capable.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Alan, had you condemned as artificial the rest of Friend\r\nGeddes\'s grounds, there is a willow walk by the very verge of the\r\nstream, so sad, so solemn, and so silent, that it must have commanded\r\nyour admiration. The brook, restrained at the ultimate boundary of the\r\ngrounds by a natural dam-dike or ledge of rocks, seemed, even in\r\nits present swollen state, scarcely to glide along: and the pale\r\nwillow-trees, dropping their long branches into the stream, gathered\r\naround them little coronals of the foam that floated down from the more\r\nrapid stream above. The high rock, which formed the opposite bank of the\r\nbrook, was seen dimly through the branches, and its pale and splintered\r\nfront, garlanded with long streamers of briers and other creeping\r\nplants, seemed a barrier between the quiet path which we trod, and the\r\ntoiling and bustling world beyond. The path itself, following the sweep\r\nof the stream, made a very gentle curve; enough, however, served by its\r\ninflection completely to hide the end of the walk until you arrived at\r\nit. A deep and sullen sound, which increased as you proceeded, prepared\r\nyou for this termination, which was indeed only a plain root-seat, from\r\nwhich you looked on a fall of about six or seven feet, where the brook\r\nflung itself over the ledge of natural rock I have already mentioned,\r\nwhich there crossed its course.\r\n\r\nThe quiet and twilight seclusion of this walk rendered it a fit scene\r\nfor confidential communing; and having nothing more interesting to\r\nsay to my fair Quaker, I took the liberty of questioning her about the\r\nlaird; for you are, or ought to be, aware, that next to discussing the\r\naffairs of the heart, the fair sex are most interested in those of their\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nI did not conceal either my curiosity, or the check which it had\r\nreceived from Joshua, and I saw that my companion answered with\r\nembarrassment. \'I must not speak otherwise than truly,\' she said; \'and\r\ntherefore I tell thee, that my brother dislikes, and that I fear, the\r\nman of whom thou hast asked me. Perhaps we are both wrong--but he is a\r\nman of violence, and hath great influence over many, who, following\r\nthe trade of sailors and fishermen, become as rude as the elements with\r\nwhich they contend. He hath no certain name among them, which is\r\nnot unusual, their rude fashion being to distinguish each other\r\nby nicknames; and they have called him the Laird of the Lakes (not\r\nremembering there should be no one called Lord, save one only) in idle\r\nderision; the pools of salt water left by the tide among the sands being\r\ncalled the Lakes of Solway.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has he no other revenue than he derives from these sands?\' I asked.\r\n\r\n\'That I cannot answer,\' replied Rachel; \'men say that he wants not\r\nmoney, though he lives like an ordinary fisherman, and that he imparts\r\nfreely of his means to the poor around him. They intimate that he is\r\na man of consequence, once deeply engaged in the unhappy affair of the\r\nrebellion, and even still too much in danger from the government\r\nto assume his own name. He is often absent from his cottage at\r\nBroken-burn-cliffs, for weeks and months.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought,\' said I, \'that the government would scarce, at\r\nthis time of day, be likely to proceed against any one even of the most\r\nobnoxious rebels. Many years have passed away\'--\r\n\r\n\'It is true,\' she replied; \'yet such persons may understand that their\r\nbeing connived at depends on their living in obscurity. But indeed there\r\ncan nothing certain be known among these rude people. The truth is not\r\nin them--most of them participate in the unlawful trade betwixt these\r\nparts and the neighbouring shore of England; and they are familiar with\r\nevery species of falsehood and deceit.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a pity,\' I remarked, \'your brother should have neighbours of such\r\na description, especially as I understand he is at some variance with\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where, when, and about what matter?\' answered Miss Geddes, with an\r\neager and timorous anxiety, which made me regret having touched on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI told her, in a way as little alarming as I could devise, the purport\r\nof what passed betwixt this Laird of the Lakes and her brother, at their\r\nmorning\'s interview.\r\n\r\n\'You affright me much,\' answered she; \'it is this very circumstance\r\nwhich has scared me in the watches of the night. When my brother Joshua\r\nwithdrew from an active share in the commercial concerns of my father,\r\nbeing satisfied with the portion of worldly substance which he already\r\npossessed, there were one or two undertakings in which he retained an\r\ninterest, either because his withdrawing might have been prejudicial to\r\nfriends, or because he wished to retain some mode of occupying his time.\r\nAmongst the more important of these is a fishing station on the coast,\r\nwhere, by certain improved modes of erecting snares, opening at the\r\nadvance of the tide, and shutting at the reflux, many more fish are\r\ntaken than can be destroyed by those who, like the men of Broken-burn,\r\nuse only the boat-net and spear, or fishing-rod. They complain of these\r\ntide-nets, as men call them, as an innovation, and pretend to a right\r\nto remove and destroy them by the strong hand. I fear me, this man of\r\nviolence, whom they call the laird, will execute these his threats,\r\nwhich cannot be without both loss and danger to my brother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Geddes,\' said I, \'ought to apply to the civil, magistrate; there\r\nare soldiers at Dumfries who would be detached for his protection.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thou speakest, friend Latimer,\' answered the lady, \'as one who is\r\nstill in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity. God forbid that\r\nwe should endeavour to preserve nets of flax and stakes of wood, or the\r\nMammon of gain which they procure for us, by the hands of men of war and\r\nat the risk of spilling human blood.\'\r\n\r\n\'I respect your scruples,\' I replied; \'but since such is your way\r\nof thinking, your brother ought to avert the danger by compromise or\r\nsubmission.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps it would be best,\' answered Rachel; \'but what can I say? Even\r\nin the best-trained temper there may remain some leaven of the old Adam;\r\nand I know not whether it is this or a better spirit that maketh my\r\nbrother Joshua determine, that though he will not resist force by force,\r\nneither will he yield up his right to mere threats, or encourage wrong\r\nto others by yielding to menaces. His partners, he says, confide in his\r\nsteadiness: and that he must not disappoint them by yielding up their\r\nright for the fear of the threats of man, whose breath is in his\r\nnostrils.\'\r\n\r\nThis observation convinced me that the spirit of the old sharers of\r\nthe spoil was not utterly departed even from the bosom of the peaceful\r\nQuaker; and I could not help confessing internally that Joshua had the\r\nright, when he averred that there was as much courage in sufferance as\r\nin exertion.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the farther end of the willow walk, the sullen and\r\ncontinuous sound of the dashing waters became still more and more\r\naudible, and at length rendered it difficult for us to communicate\r\nwith each other. The conversation dropped, but apparently my companion\r\ncontinued to dwell upon the apprehensions which it had excited. At the\r\nbottom of the walk we obtained a view of the cascade, where the swollen\r\nbrook flung itself in foam and tumult over the natural barrier of rock,\r\nwhich seemed in vain to attempt to bar its course. I gazed with delight,\r\nand, turning to express my sentiment to my companion, I observed that\r\nshe had folded her hands in an attitude of sorrowful resignation, which\r\nshowed her thoughts were far from the scene which lay before her.\r\nWhen she saw that her abstraction was observed, she resumed her former\r\nplacidity of manner; and having given me sufficient time to admire this\r\ntermination of our sober and secluded walk, proposed that me should\r\nreturn to the house through her brother\'s farm. \'Even we Quakers, as\r\nwe are called, have our little pride,\' she said; \'and my brother Joshua\r\nwould not forgive me, were I not to show thee the fields which he taketh\r\ndelight to cultivate after the newest and best fashion; for which, I\r\npromise thee, he hath received much praise from good judges, as well as\r\nsome ridicule from those who think it folly to improve on the customs of\r\nour ancestors.\'\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she opened a low door, leading through a moss and\r\nivy-covered wall, the boundary of the pleasure-ground, into the open\r\nfields; through which we moved by a convenient path, leading, with good\r\ntaste and simplicity, by stile and hedgerow, through pasturage, and\r\narable, and woodland; so that in all ordinary weather, the good man\r\nmight, without even soiling his shoes, perform his perambulation round\r\nthe farm. There were seats also, on which to rest; and though not\r\nadorned with inscriptions, nor quite so frequent in occurrence as those\r\nmentioned in the account of the Leasowes, their situation was always\r\nchosen with respect to some distant prospect to be commanded, or some\r\nhome-view to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\nBut what struck me most in Joshua\'s domain was the quantity and the\r\ntameness of the game. The hen partridge scarce abandoned the roost, at\r\nthe foot of the hedge where she had assembled her covey, though the path\r\nwent close beside her; and the hare, remaining on her form, gazed at us\r\nas we passed, with her full dark eye, or rising lazily and hopping to\r\na little distance, stood erect to look at us with more curiosity than\r\napprehension. I observed to Miss Geddes the extreme tameness of these\r\ntimid and shy animals, and she informed me that their confidence arose\r\nfrom protection in the summer, and relief during the winter.\r\n\r\n\'They are pets,\' she said, \'of my brother, who considers them as the\r\nbetter entitled to his kindness that they are a race persecuted by the\r\nworld in general. He denieth himself,\' she said, \'even the company of a\r\ndog, that these creatures may here at least enjoy undisturbed security.\r\nYet this harmless or humane propensity, or humour, hath given offence,\'\r\nshe added, \'to our dangerous neighbours.\'\r\n\r\nShe explained this, by telling me that my host of the preceding night\r\nwas remarkable for his attachment to field-sports, which he pursued\r\nwithout much regard to the wishes of the individuals over whose property\r\nhe followed them. The undefined mixture of respect and fear with which\r\nhe was generally regarded induced most of the neighbouring land-holders\r\nto connive at what they would perhaps in another have punished as a\r\ntrespass; but Joshua Geddes would not permit the intrusion of any\r\none upon his premises, and as he had before offended several country\r\nneighbours, who, because he would neither shoot himself nor permit\r\nothers to do so, compared him to the dog in the manger, so he now\r\naggravated the displeasure which the Laird of the Lakes had already\r\nconceived against him, by positively debarring him from pursuing his\r\nsport over his grounds--\'So that,\' said Rachel Geddes, \'I sometimes wish\r\nour lot had been cast elsewhere than in these pleasant borders, where,\r\nif we had less of beauty around us, we might have had a neighbourhood of\r\npeace and, goodwill.\'\r\n\r\nWe at length returned to the house, where Miss Geddes showed me a small\r\nstudy, containing a little collection of books, in two separate presses.\r\n\r\n\'These,\' said she, pointing to the smaller press, \'will, if thou\r\nbestowest thy leisure upon them, do thee good; and these,\' pointing to\r\nthe other and larger cabinet, \'can, I believe, do thee little harm. Some\r\nof our people do indeed hold, that every writer who is not with us\r\nis against us; but brother Joshua is mitigated in his opinions, and\r\ncorrespondeth with our friend John Scot of Amwell, who hath himself\r\nconstructed verses well approved of even in the world. I wish thee many\r\ngood thoughts till our family meet at the hour of dinner.\'\r\n\r\nLeft alone, I tried both collections; the first consisted entirely\r\nof religious and controversial tracts, and the latter formed a small\r\nselection of history and of moral writers, both in prose and verse.\r\n\r\nNeither collection promising much amusement, thou hast, in these close\r\npages, the fruits of my tediousness; and truly, I think, writing history\r\n(one\'s self being the subject) is as amusing as reading that of foreign\r\ncountries, at any time.\r\n\r\nSam, still more drunk than sober, arrived in due time with my\r\nportmanteau, and enabled me to put my dress into order, better befitting\r\nthis temple of cleanliness and decorum, where (to conclude) I believe I\r\nshall be a sojourner more days than one. [See Note 1.]\r\n\r\nPS.--I have noted your adventure, as you home-bred youths may perhaps\r\nterm it, concerning the visit of your doughty laird. We travellers hold\r\nsuch an incident no great consequence, though it may serve to embellish\r\nthe uniform life of Brown\'s Square. But art thou not ashamed to attempt\r\nto interest one who is seeing the world at large, and studying human\r\nnature on a large scale, by so bald a narrative? Why, what does it\r\namount to, after all, but that a Tory laird dined with a Whig lawyer? no\r\nvery uncommon matter, especially as you state Mr. Herries to have lost\r\nthe estate, though retaining the designation. The laird behaves with\r\nhaughtiness and impertinence--nothing out of character in that: is NOT\r\nkicked down stairs, as he ought to have been, were Alan Fairford half\r\nthe man that he would wish his friends to think him. Aye, but then, as\r\nthe young lawyer, instead of showing his friend the door, chose to make\r\nuse of it himself, he overheard the laird aforesaid ask the old lawyer\r\nconcerning Darsie Latimer--no doubt earnestly inquiring after the\r\nhandsome, accomplished inmate of his family, who has so lately made\r\nThemis his bow and declined the honour of following her farther. You\r\nlaugh at me for my air-drawn castles; but confess, have they not surer\r\nfooting, in general, than two words spoken by such a man as Herries?\r\nAnd yet--and yet--I would rally the matter off, Alan; but in dark nights\r\neven the glow-worm becomes an object of lustre, and to one plunged in\r\nmy uncertainty and ignorance, the slightest gleam that promises\r\nintelligence is interesting. My life is like the subterranean river in\r\nthe Peak of Derby, visible only where it crosses the celebrated cavern.\r\nI am here, and this much I know; but where I have sprung from, or\r\nwhither my course of life is like to tend, who shall tell me? Your\r\nfather, too, seemed interested and alarmed, and talked of writing; would\r\nto Heaven he may!--I send daily to the post-town for letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII\r\n\r\nALAN FAIRFORD TO DARSIE LATIMER\r\n\r\nThou mayst clap thy wings and crow as thou pleasest. You go in search\r\nof adventures, but adventures come to me unsought for; and oh! in what a\r\npleasing shape came mine, since it arrived in the form of a client--and\r\na fair client to boot! What think you of that, Darsie! you who are such\r\na sworn squire of dames? Will this not match my adventures with thine,\r\nthat hunt salmon on horseback, and will it not, besides, eclipse\r\nthe history of a whole tribe of Broadbrims?--But I must proceed\r\nmethodically.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to-day from the College, I was surprised to see a broad\r\ngrin distending the adust countenance of the faithful James Wilkinson,\r\nwhich, as the circumstance seldom happens above once a year, was matter\r\nof some surprise. Moreover, he had a knowing glance with his eye,\r\nwhich I should have as soon expected from a dumb-waiter--an article\r\nof furniture to which James, in his usual state, may be happily\r\nassimilated. \'What the devil is the matter, James?\'\r\n\r\n\'The devil may be in the matter, for aught I ken,\' said James, with\r\nanother provoking grin; \'for here has been a woman calling for you,\r\nMaister Alan.\'\r\n\r\n\'A woman calling for me?\' said I in surprise; for you know well, that\r\nexcepting old Aunt Peggy, who comes to dinner of a Sunday, and the\r\nstill older Lady Bedrooket, who calls ten times a year for the\r\nquarterly payment of her jointure of four hundred merks, a female scarce\r\napproaches our threshold, as my father visits all his female clients at\r\ntheir own lodgings. James protested, however, that there had been a\r\nlady calling, and for me. \'As bonny a lass as I have seen,\' added James,\r\n\'since I was in the Fusileers, and kept company with Peg Baxter.\' Thou\r\nknowest all James\'s gay recollections go back to the period of his\r\nmilitary service, the years he has spent in ours having probably been\r\ndull enough.\r\n\r\n\'Did the lady leave no name nor place of address?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' replied James; \'but she asked when you wad be at hame, and I\r\nappointed her for twelve o\'clock, when the house wad be quiet, and your\r\nfather at the Bank.\'\r\n\r\n\'For shame, James! how can you think my father\'s being at home or abroad\r\ncould be of consequence?--The lady is of course a decent person?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'se uphaud her that, sir--she is nane of your--WHEW\'--(Here James\r\nsupplied a blank with a low whistle)--\'but I didna ken--my maister makes\r\nan unco wark if a woman comes here.\'\r\n\r\nI passed into my own room, not ill-pleased that my father was absent,\r\nnotwithstanding I had thought it proper to rebuke James for having so\r\ncontrived it, I disarranged my books, to give them the appearance of a\r\ngraceful confusion on the table, and laying my foils (useless since your\r\ndeparture) across the mantelpiece, that the lady might see I was TAM\r\nMARTE QUAM MERCURIO--I endeavoured to dispose my dress so as to resemble\r\nan elegant morning deshabille--gave my hair the general shade of powder\r\nwhich marks the gentleman--laid my watch and seals on the table, to\r\nhint that I understood the value of time;--and when I had made all these\r\narrangements, of which I am a little ashamed when I think of them, I had\r\nnothing better to do than to watch the dial-plate till the index\r\npointed to noon. Five minutes elapsed, which. I allowed for variation\r\nof clocks--five minutes more rendered me anxious and doubtful--and five\r\nminutes more would have made me impatient.\r\n\r\nLaugh as thou wilt; but remember, Darsie, I was a lawyer, expecting his\r\nfirst client--a young man, how strictly bred up I need not remind you,\r\nexpecting a private interview with a young and beautiful woman. But ere\r\nthe third term of five minutes had elapsed, the door-bell was heard to\r\ntinkle low and modestly, as if touched by some timid hand.\r\n\r\nJames Wilkinson, swift in nothing, is, as thou knowest, peculiarly slow\r\nin answering the door-bell; and I reckoned on five minutes good, ere his\r\nsolemn step should have ascended the stair. Time enough, thought I, for\r\na peep through the blinds, and was hastening to the window accordingly.\r\nBut I reckoned without my host; for James, who had his own curiosity\r\nas well as I, was lying PERDU in the lobby, ready to open at the first\r\ntinkle; and there was, \'This way, ma\'am--Yes, ma\'am--The lady, Mr.\r\nAlan,\' before I could get to the chair in which I proposed to be\r\ndiscovered, seated in all legal dignity. The consciousness of being\r\nhalf-caught in the act of peeping, joined to that native air of awkward\r\nbashfulness of which I am told the law will soon free me, kept me\r\nstanding on the floor in some confusion; while the lady, disconcerted\r\non her part, remained on the threshold of the room. James Wilkinson, who\r\nhad his senses most about him, and was perhaps willing to prolong his\r\nstay in the apartment, busied himself in setting a chair for the lady,\r\nand recalled me to my good-breeding by the hint. I invited her to take\r\npossession of it, and bid James withdraw.\r\n\r\nMy visitor was undeniably a lady, and probably considerably above the\r\nordinary rank--very modest, too, judging from the mixture of grace and\r\ntimidity with which she moved, and at my entreaty sat down. Her dress\r\nwas, I should suppose, both handsome and fashionable; but it was much\r\nconcealed by a walking-cloak of green silk, fancifully embroidered; in\r\nwhich, though heavy for the season, her person was enveloped, and which,\r\nmoreover, was furnished with a hood.\r\n\r\nThe devil take that hood, Darsie! for I was just able to distinguish\r\nthat, pulled as it was over the face, it concealed from me, as I was\r\nconvinced, one of the prettiest countenances I have seen, and which,\r\nfrom a sense of embarrassment, seemed to be crimsoned with a deep blush.\r\nI could see her complexion was beautiful--her chin finely turned--her\r\nlips coral--and her teeth rivals to ivory. But further the deponent\r\nsayeth not; for a clasp of gold, ornamented with it sapphire, closed\r\nthe envious mantle under the incognita\'s throat, and the cursed hood\r\nconcealed entirely the upper part of the face.\r\n\r\nI ought to have spoken first, that is certain; but ere I could get my\r\nphrases well arranged, the young lady, rendered desperate I suppose by\r\nmy hesitation opened the conversation herself.\r\n\r\n\'I fear I am an intruder, sir--I expected to meet an elderly gentleman.\'\r\n\r\nThis brought me to myself. \'My father, madam, perhaps. But you inquired\r\nfor Alan Fairford--my father\'s name is Alexander.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is Mr. Alan Fairford, undoubtedly, with whom I wished to speak,\' she\r\nsaid, with greater confusion; \'but I was told that he was advanced in\r\nlife.\'\r\n\r\n\'Some mistake, madam, I presume, betwixt my father and myself--our\r\nChristian names have the same initials, though the terminations are\r\ndifferent. I--I--I would esteem it a most fortunate mistake if I could\r\nhave the honour of supplying my father\'s place in anything that could be\r\nof service to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are very obliging, sir,\' A pause, during which she seemed\r\nundetermined whether to rise or sit still.\r\n\r\n\'I am just about to be called to the bar, madam,\' said I, in hopes to\r\nremove her scruples to open her case to me; \'and if my advice or opinion\r\ncould be of the slightest use, although I cannot presume to say that\r\nthey are much to be depended upon, yet\'--\r\n\r\nThe lady arose. \'I am truly sensible of your kindness, sir; and I have\r\nno doubt of your talents. I will be very plain with you--it is you whom\r\nI came to visit; although, now that we have met, I find it will be much\r\nbetter that I should commit my communication to writing.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope, madam, you will not be so cruel--so tantalizing, I would\r\nsay. Consider, you are my first client--your business my first\r\nconsultation--do not do me the displeasure of withdrawing your\r\nconfidence because I am a few years younger than you seem to have\r\nexpected. My attention shall make amends for my want of experience.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have no doubt of either,\' said the lady, in a grave tone, calculated\r\nto restrain the air of gallantry with which I had endeavoured to address\r\nher. \'But when you have received my letter you will find good reasons\r\nassigned why a written communication will best suit my purpose. I wish\r\nyou, sir, a good morning.\' And she left the apartment, her poor baffled\r\ncounsel scraping, and bowing, and apologizing for anything that might\r\nhave been disagreeable to her, although the front of my offence seems to\r\nbe my having been discovered to be younger than my father.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened--out she went--walked along the pavement, turned\r\ndown the close, and put the sun, I believe, into her pocket when she\r\ndisappeared, so suddenly did dullness and darkness sink down on the\r\nsquare, when she was no longer visible. I stood for a moment as if I\r\nhad been senseless, not recollecting what a fund of entertainment I must\r\nhave supplied to our watchful friends on the other side of the green.\r\nThen it darted on my mind that I might dog her, and ascertain at least\r\nwho or what she was. Off I set--ran down the close, where she was no\r\nlonger to be seen, and demanded of one of the dyer\'s lads whether he had\r\nseen a lady go down the close, or had observed which way she turned.\r\n\r\n\'A leddy!\'--said the dyer, staring at me with his rainbow countenance.\r\n\'Mr. Alan, what takes you out, rinning like daft, without your hat?\'\r\n\r\n\'The devil take my hat!\' answered I, running back, however, in quest of\r\nit; snatched it up, and again sallied forth. But as I reached the head\r\nof the close once more, I had sense enough to recollect that all pursuit\r\nwould be now in vain. Besides, I saw my friend, the journeyman dyer, in\r\nclose confabulation with a pea-green personage of his own profession,\r\nand was conscious, like Scrub, that they talked of me, because they\r\nlaughed consumedly. I had no mind, by a second sudden appearance, to\r\nconfirm the report that Advocate Fairford was \'gaen daft,\' which had\r\nprobably spread from Campbell\'s Close-foot to the Meal-market Stairs;\r\nand so slunk back within my own hole again.\r\n\r\nMy first employment was to remove all traces of that elegant and\r\nfanciful disposition of my effects, from which I had hoped for so much\r\ncredit; for I was now ashamed and angry at having thought an instant\r\nupon the mode of receiving a visit which had commenced so agreeably,\r\nbut terminated in a manner so unsatisfactory. I put my folios in their\r\nplaces--threw the foils into the dressing-closet--tormenting myself all\r\nthe while with the fruitless doubt, whether I had missed an opportunity\r\nor escaped a stratagem, or whether the young person had been really\r\nstartled, as she seemed to intimate, by the extreme youth of her\r\nintended legal adviser. The mirror was not unnaturally called in to aid;\r\nand that cabinet-counsellor pronounced me rather short, thick-set,\r\nwith a cast of features fitter, I trust, for the bar than the ball--not\r\nhandsome enough for blushing virgins to pine for my sake, or even to\r\ninvent sham cases to bring them to my chambers--yet not ugly enough\r\neither to scare those away who came on real business--dark, to be sure,\r\nbut--NIGRI SUNT HYACINTHI--there are pretty things to be said in favour\r\nof that complexion.\r\n\r\nAt length--as common sense will get the better in all cases when a man\r\nwill but give it fair play--I began to stand convicted in my own mind,\r\nas an ass before the interview, for having expected too much--an ass\r\nduring the interview, for having failed to extract the lady\'s real\r\npurpose--and an especial ass, now that it was over, for thinking so much\r\nabout it. But I can think of nothing else, and therefore I am determined\r\nto think of this to some good purpose.\r\n\r\nYou remember Murtough O\'Hara\'s defence of the Catholic doctrine of\r\nconfession; because, \'by his soul, his sins were always a great burden\r\nto his mind, till he had told them to the priest; and once confessed, he\r\nnever thought more about them.\' I have tried his receipt, therefore; and\r\nhaving poured my secret mortification into thy trusty ear, I will think\r\nno more about this maid of the mist,\r\n\r\n   Who, with no face, as \'twere, outfaced me.\r\n\r\n--Four o\'clock. Plague on her green mantle, she can be nothing\r\nbetter than a fairy; she keeps possession of my head yet! All during\r\ndinner-time I was terribly absent; but, luckily, my father gave the\r\nwhole credit of my reverie to the abstract nature of the doctrine, VINCO\r\nVINCENTEM, ERGO VINCO TE; upon which brocard of law the professor this\r\nmorning lectured. So I got an early dismissal to my own crib, and here\r\nam I studying, in one sense, VINCERE VINCENTEM, to get the better of\r\nthe silly passion of curiosity--I think--I think it amounts to nothing\r\nelse--which has taken such possession of my imagination, and is\r\nperpetually worrying me with the question--will she write or no? She\r\nwill not--she will not! So says Reason, and adds, Why should she take\r\nthe trouble to enter into correspondence with one who, instead of a\r\nbold, alert, prompt gallant, proved a chicken-hearted boy, and left her\r\nthe whole awkwardness of explanation, which he should have met half-way?\r\nBut then, says Fancy, she WILL write, for she was not a bit that sort\r\nof person whom you, Mr. Reason, in your wisdom, take her to be. She was\r\ndisconcerted enough, without my adding to her distress by any impudent\r\nconduct on my part. And she will write, for--By Heaven, she HAS written,\r\nDarsie, and with a vengeance! Here is her letter, thrown into the\r\nkitchen by a caddie, too faithful to be bribed, either by money or\r\nwhisky, to say more than that he received it, with sixpence, from an\r\nordinary-looking woman, as he was plying on his station near the Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'FOR ALAN FAIRFORD, ESQUIRE, BARRISTER.\r\n\r\n\'SIR,\r\n\r\n\'Excuse my mistake of to-day. I had accidentally learnt that Mr. Darsie\r\nLatimer had an intimate friend and associate in Mr. A. Fairford. When I\r\ninquired for such a person, he was pointed out to me at the Cross (as\r\nI think the Exchange of your city is called) in the character of a\r\nrespectable elderly man--your father, as I now understand. On inquiry at\r\nBrown\'s Square, where I understood he resided, I used the full name of\r\nAlan, which naturally occasioned you the trouble of this day\'s visit.\r\nUpon further inquiry, I am led to believe that you are likely to be the\r\nperson most active in the matter to which I am now about to direct your\r\nattention; and I regret much that circumstances, arising out of my own\r\nparticular situation, prevent my communicating to you personally what I\r\nnow apprise you of in this matter.\r\n\r\n\'Your friend, Mr. Darsie Latimer, is in a situation of considerable\r\ndanger. You are doubtless aware that he has been cautioned not to trust\r\nhimself in England. Now, if he has not absolutely transgressed this\r\nfriendly injunction, he has at least approached as nearly to the menaced\r\ndanger as he could do, consistently with the letter of the prohibition.\r\nHe has chosen his abode in a neighbourhood very perilous to him; and\r\nit is only by a speedy return to Edinburgh, or at least by a removal to\r\nsome more remote part of Scotland, that he can escape the machinations\r\nof those whose enmity he has to fear. I must speak in mystery, but my\r\nwords are not the less certain; and, I believe, you know enough of your\r\nfriend\'s fortunes to be aware that I could not write this much without\r\nbeing even more intimate with them than you are.\r\n\r\n\'If he cannot, or will not, take the advice here given, it is my opinion\r\nthat you should join him, if possible, without delay, and use, by\r\nyour personal presence and entreaty, the arguments which may prove\r\nineffectual in writing. One word more, and I implore of your candour to\r\ntake it as it is meant. No one supposes that Mr. Fairford\'s zeal in his\r\nfriend\'s service needs to be quickened by mercenary motives. \'But report\r\nsays, that Mr. Alan Fairford, not having yet entered on his professional\r\ncareer, may, in such a case as this, want the means, though he cannot\r\nwant the inclination, to act with promptitude. The enclosed note Mr.\r\nAlan Fairford must be pleased to consider as his first professional\r\nemolument; and she who sends it hopes it will be the omen of unbounded\r\nsuccess, though the fee comes from a hand so unknown as that of \'GREEN\r\nMANTLE\'.\r\n\r\nA bank-note of L20 was the enclosure, and the whole incident left me\r\nspeechless with astonishment. I am not able to read over the beginning\r\nof my own letter, which forms the introduction to this extraordinary\r\ncommunication. I only know that, though mixed with a quantity of foolery\r\n(God knows very much different from my present feelings), it gives an\r\naccount sufficiently accurate, of the mysterious person from whom this\r\nletter comes, and that I have neither time nor patience to separate the\r\nabsurd commentary from the text, which it is so necessary you should\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nCombine this warning, so strangely conveyed, with the caution impressed\r\non you by your London correspondent, Griffiths, against your visiting\r\nEngland--with the character of your Laird of the Solway Lakes--with the\r\nlawless habits of the people on that frontier country, where warrants\r\nare not easily executed owing to the jealousy entertained by either\r\ncountry of the legal interference of the other; remember, that even Sir\r\nJohn Fielding said to my father that he could never trace a rogue beyond\r\nthe Briggend of Dumfries--think that the distinctions of Whig and\r\nTory, Papist and Protestant, still keep that country in a loose and\r\ncomparatively lawless state--think of all this, my dearest Darsie, and\r\nremember that, while at this Mount Sharon of yours, you are residing\r\nwith a family actually menaced with forcible interference, and who,\r\nwhile their obstinacy provokes violence, are by principle bound to\r\nabstain from resistance.\r\n\r\nNay, let me tell you, professionally, that the legality of the mode of\r\nfishing practised by your friend Joshua is greatly doubted by our\r\nbest lawyers; and that, if the stake-nets be considered as actually an\r\nunlawful obstruction raised in the channel of the estuary, an assembly\r\nof persons who shall proceed, VIA FACTI, to pull dawn and destroy them,\r\nwould not, in the eye of the law, be esteemed guilty of a riot. So, by\r\nremaining where you are, YOU are likely to be engaged in a quarrel with\r\nwhich you have nothing to do, and thus to enable your enemies, whoever\r\nthese may be, to execute, amid the confusion of a general hubbub,\r\nwhatever designs they may have against your personal safety.\r\nBlack-fishers, poachers, and smugglers are a sort of gentry that will\r\nnot be much checked, either by your Quaker\'s texts, or by your chivalry.\r\nIf you are Don Quixote enough to lay lance in rest, in defence of those\r\nof the stake-net, and of the sad-coloured garment, I pronounce you but\r\na lost knight; for, as I said before, I doubt if these potent redressers\r\nof wrongs, the justices and constables, will hold themselves warranted\r\nto interfere. In a word, return, my dear Amadis; the adventure of the\r\nSolway-nets is not reserved for your worship. Come back, and I will be\r\nyour faithful Sancho Panza upon a more hopeful quest. We will beat\r\nabout together, in search of this Urganda, the Unknown She of the Green\r\nMantle, who can read this, the riddle of thy fate, better than wise\r\nEppie of Buckhaven, [Well known in the Chap-Book, called the History of\r\nBuckhaven.] or Cassandra herself.\r\n\r\nI would fain trifle, Darsie; for, in debating with you, jests will\r\nsometimes go farther than arguments; but I am sick at heart and cannot\r\nkeep the ball up. If you have a moment\'s regard for the friendship we\r\nhave so often vowed to each other, let my wishes for once prevail over\r\nyour own venturous and romantic temper. I am quite serious in thinking\r\nthat the information communicated to my father by this Mr. Herries, and\r\nthe admonitory letter of the young lady, bear upon each other; and that,\r\nwere you here, you might learn something from one or other, or from\r\nboth, that; might throw light on your birth and parentage. You will not,\r\nsurely, prefer an idle whim to the prospect which is thus held out to\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nI would, agreeably to the hint I have received in the young lady\'s\r\nletter (for I am confident that such is her condition), have ere now\r\nbeen with you to urge these things, instead of pouring them out upon\r\npaper. But you know that the day for my trials is appointed; I have\r\nalready gone through the form of being introduced to the examinators,\r\nand have gotten my titles assigned me. All this should not keep me at\r\nhome, but my father would view any irregularity upon this occasion as a\r\nmortal blow to the hopes which he has cherished most fondly during his\r\nlife; viz. my being called to the bar with some credit. For my own\r\npart, I know there is no great difficulty in passing these formal\r\nexaminations, else how have some of our acquaintance got through them?\r\nBut, to my father, these formalities compose an august and serious\r\nsolemnity, to which he has long looked forward, and my absenting myself\r\nat this moment would wellnigh drive him distracted. Yet I shall go\r\naltogether distracted myself, if I have not an instant assurance from\r\nyou that you are hastening hither. Meanwhile I have desired Hannah to\r\nget your little crib into the best order possible. I cannot learn\r\nthat my father has yet written to you; nor has he spoken more of his\r\ncommunication with Birrenswork; but when I let him have some inkling\r\nof the dangers you are at present incurring, I know my request that you\r\nwill return immediately will have his cordial support.\r\n\r\nAnother reason yet--I must give a dinner, as usual, upon my admission,\r\nto our friends; and my father, laying aside all his usual considerations\r\nof economy, has desired it may be in the best style possible.\r\nCome hither then, dear Darsie! or, I protest to you, I shall send\r\nexamination, admission-dinner, and guests to the devil, and come, in\r\nperson, to fetch you with a vengeance. Thine, in much anxiety, A. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX\r\n\r\nALEXANDER FAIRFORD, W.S., TO MR. DARSIE LATIMER\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. DARSIE,\r\n\r\nHaving been your FACTOR LOCO TUTORIS or rather, I ought to say, in\r\ncorrectness (since I acted without warrant from the court), your\r\nNEGOTIORUM GESTOR, that connexion occasions my present writing. And\r\nalthough having rendered an account of my intromissions, which have been\r\nregularly approved of, not only by yourself (whom I could not prevail\r\nupon to look at more than the docket and sum total), but also by the\r\nworthy Mr. Samuel Griffiths of London, being the hand through whom the\r\nremittances were made, I may, in some sense, be considered as to you\r\nFUNCTUS OFFICIO; yet to speak facetiously, I trust you will not hold me\r\naccountable as a vicious intromitter, should I still consider myself as\r\noccasionally interested in your welfare. My motives for writing, at this\r\ntime, are twofold.\r\n\r\nI have met with a Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, a gentleman of very\r\nancient descent, but who hath in time past been in difficulties, nor\r\ndo I know if his affairs are yet well redd. Birrenswork says that he\r\nbelieves he was very familiar with your father, whom he states to have\r\nbeen called Ralph Latimer of Langcote Hall, in Westmoreland; and he\r\nmentioned family affairs, which it may be of the highest importance to\r\nyou to be acquainted with; but as he seemed to decline communicating\r\nthem to me, I could not civilly urge him thereanent. Thus much I know,\r\nthat Mr. Herries had his own share in the late desperate and unhappy\r\nmatter of 1745, and was in trouble about it, although that is probably\r\nnow over. Moreover, although he did not profess the Popish religion\r\nopenly, he had an eye that way. And both of these are reasons why I have\r\nhesitated to recommend him to a youth who maybe hath not altogether so\r\nwell founded his opinions concerning Kirk and State, that they might\r\nnot be changed by some sudden wind of doctrine. For I have observed\r\nye, Master Darsie, to be rather tinctured with the old leaven of\r\nprelacy--this under your leave; and although God forbid that you should\r\nbe in any manner disaffected to the Protestant Hanoverian line, yet ye\r\nhave ever loved to hear the blawing, blazing stories which the Hieland\r\ngentlemen tell of those troublous times, which, if it were their will,\r\nthey had better pretermit, as tending rather to shame than to honour.\r\nIt is come to me also by a sidewind, as I may say, that you have been\r\nneighbouring more than was needful among some of the pestilent sect of\r\nQuakers--a people who own neither priest nor king, nor civil magistrate,\r\nnor the fabric of our law, and will not depone either IN CIVILIBUS\r\nor CRIMINALIBUS, be the loss to the lieges what it may. Anent which\r\nheresies, it were good ye read \'The Snake in the Grass\' or \'The Foot\r\nout of the Snare,\' being both well-approved tracts, touching these\r\ndoctrines.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Darsie, ye are to judge for yourself whether ye can safely to\r\nyour soul\'s weal remain longer among these Papists and Quakers--these\r\ndefections on the right hand, and failings away on the left; and truly\r\nif you can confidently resist these evil examples of doctrine, I think\r\nye may as well tarry in the bounds where ye are, until you see Mr.\r\nHerries of Birrenswork, who does assuredly know more of your matters\r\nthan I thought had been communicated to any man in Scotland. I would\r\nfain have precognosced him myself on these affairs, but found him\r\nunwilling to speak out, as I have partly intimated before.\r\n\r\nTo call a new cause--I have the pleasure to tell you, that Alan has\r\npassed his private Scots Law examinations with good approbation--a great\r\nrelief to my mind; especially as worthy Mr. Pest told me in my ear there\r\nwas no fear of \'the callant\', as he familiarly called him, which gives\r\nme great heart. His public trials, which are nothing in comparison\r\nsave a mere form, are to take place, by order of the Honourable Dean\r\nof Faculty, on Wednesday first; and on Friday he puts on the gown, and\r\ngives a bit chack of dinner to his friends and acquaintances, as is, you\r\nknow, the custom. Your company will be wished for there, Master Darsie,\r\nby more than him, which I regret to think is impossible to have, as well\r\nby your engagements, as that our cousin, Peter Fairford, comes from the\r\nWest on purpose, and we have no place to offer him but your chamber\r\nin the wall. And, to be plain with you, after my use and wont, Master\r\nDarsie, it may be as well that Alan and you do not meet till he is\r\nhefted as it were to his new calling. You are a pleasant gentleman, and\r\nfull of daffing, which may well become you, as you have enough (as\r\nI understand) to uphold your merry humour. If you regard the matter\r\nwisely, you would perchance consider that a man of substance should have\r\na douce and staid demeanour; yet you are so far from growing grave and\r\nconsiderate with the increase of your annual income, that the richer\r\nyou become, the merrier I think you grow. But this must be at your own\r\npleasure, so far as you are concerned. Alan, however (overpassing my\r\nsmall savings), has the world to win; and louping and laughing, as you\r\nand he were wont to do, would soon make the powder flee out of his wig,\r\nand the pence out of his pocket. Nevertheless, I trust you will meet\r\nwhen you return from your rambles; for there is a time, as the wise man\r\nsayeth, for gathering, and a time for casting away; it is always the\r\npart of a man of sense to take the gathering time first. I remain,\r\ndear sir, your well-wishing friend; and obedient to command, ALEXANDER\r\nFAIRFORD.\r\n\r\nPS.--Alan\'s Thesis is upon the title DE PERICULO ET COMMODO REI\r\nVENDITAE, and is a very pretty piece of Latinity.--Ross House, in our\r\nneighbourhood, is nearly finished, and is thought to excel Duff House in\r\nornature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X\r\n\r\nDARSIE LATIMER TO ALAN FAIRFORD\r\n\r\nThe plot thickens, Alan. I have your letter, and also one from your\r\nfather. The last makes it impossible for me to comply with the kind\r\nrequest which the former urges. No--I cannot be with you, Alan; and\r\nthat, for the best of all reasons--I cannot and ought not to counteract\r\nyour father\'s anxious wishes. I do not take it unkind of him that he\r\ndesires my absence. It is natural that he should wish for his son\r\nwhat his son so well deserves--the advantage of a wiser and steadier\r\ncompanion than I seem to him. And yet I am sure I have often laboured\r\nhard enough to acquire that decency of demeanour which can no more be\r\nsuspected of breaking bounds, than an owl of catching a butterfly.\r\n\r\nBut it was in vain that I have knitted my brows till I had the headache,\r\nin order to acquire the reputation of a grave, solid, and well-judging\r\nyouth. Your father always has discovered, or thought that he discovered,\r\na hare-brained eccentricity lying folded among the wrinkles of my\r\nforehead, which rendered me a perilous associate for the future\r\ncounsellor and ultimate judge. Well, Corporal Nym\'s philosophy must\r\nbe my comfort--\'Things must be as they may.\'--I cannot come to your\r\nfather\'s house, where he wishes not to see me; and as to your coming\r\nhither,--by all that is dear to me, I vow that if you are guilty of such\r\na piece of reckless folly--not to say undutiful cruelty, considering\r\nyour father\'s thoughts and wishes--I will never speak to you again as\r\nlong as I live! I am perfectly serious. And besides, your father, while\r\nhe in a manner prohibits me from returning to Edinburgh, gives me the\r\nstrongest reasons for continuing a little while longer in this country,\r\nby holding out the hope that I may receive from your old friend, Mr.\r\nHerries of Birrenswork, some particulars concerning my origin, with\r\nwhich that ancient recusant seems to be acquainted.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman mentioned the name of a family in Westmoreland, with\r\nwhich he supposes me connected. My inquiries here after such a family\r\nhave been ineffectual, for the borderers, on either side, know little\r\nof each other. But I shall doubtless find some English person of whom to\r\nmake inquiries, since the confounded fetterlock clapped on my movements\r\nby old Griffiths, prevents me repairing to England in person. At\r\nleast, the prospect of obtaining some information is greater here than\r\nelsewhere; it will be an apology for my making a longer stay in this\r\nneighbourhood, a line of conduct which seems to have your father\'s\r\nsanction, whose opinion must be sounder than that of your wandering\r\ndamoselle.\r\n\r\nIf the road were paved with dangers which leads to such a discovery, I\r\ncannot for a moment hesitate to tread it. But in fact there is no peril\r\nin the case. If the Tritons of the Solway shall proceed to pull down\r\nhonest Joshua\'s tide-nets, I am neither Quixote enough in disposition,\r\nnor Goliath enough in person, to attempt their protection. I have no\r\nidea of attempting to prop a falling house by putting my shoulders\r\nagainst it. And indeed, Joshua gave me a hint that the company which he\r\nbelongs to, injured in the way threatened (some of them being men who\r\nthought after the fashion of the world), would pursue the rioters\r\nat law, and recover damages, in which probably his own ideas of\r\nnon-resistance will not prevent his participating. Therefore the whole\r\naffair will take its course as law will, as I only mean to interfere\r\nwhen it may be necessary to direct the course of the plaintiffs to\r\nthy chambers; and I request they may find thee intimate with all the\r\nScottish statutes concerning salmon fisheries, from the LEX AQUARUM,\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nAs for the Lady of the Mantle, I will lay a wager that the sun so\r\nbedazzled thine eyes on that memorable morning, that everything thou\r\ndidst look upon seemed green; and notwithstanding James Wilkinson\'s\r\nexperience in the Fusileers, as well as his negative whistle, I will\r\nventure to hold a crown that she is but a what-shall-call-\'um after all.\r\nLet not even the gold persuade you to the contrary. She may make a shift\r\nto cause you to disgorge that, and (immense spoil!) a session\'s fees\r\nto boot, if you look not all the sharper about you. Or if it should be\r\notherwise, and if indeed there lurk some mystery under this visitation,\r\ncredit me, it is one which thou canst not penetrate, nor can I as yet\r\neven attempt to explain it; since, if I prove mistaken, and mistaken I\r\nmay easily be, I would be fain to creep into Phalaris\'s bull, were\r\nit standing before me ready heated, rather than be roasted with thy\r\nraillery. Do not tax me with want of confidence; for the instant I can\r\nthrow any light on the matter thou shalt have it; but while I am only\r\nblundering about in the dark, I do not choose to call wise folks to see\r\nme, perchance, break my nose against a post. So if you marvel at this,\r\n\r\n  E\'en marvel on till time makes all things plain.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, kind Alan, let me proceed in my diurnal.\r\n\r\nOn the third or fourth day after my arrival at Mount Sharon, Time, that\r\nbald sexton to whom I have just referred you, did certainly limp more\r\nheavily along with me than he had done at first. The quaint morality\r\nof Joshua, and Huguenot simplicity of his sister, began to lose much of\r\ntheir raciness with their novelty, and my mode of life, by dint of being\r\nvery quiet, began to feel abominably dull. It was, as thou say\'st, as\r\nif the Quakers had put the sun in their pockets--all around was soft\r\nand mild, and even pleasant; but there was, in the whole routine, a\r\nuniformity, a want of interest, a helpless and hopeless languor, which\r\nrendered life insipid. No doubt, my worthy host and hostess felt none\r\nof this void, this want of excitation, which was becoming oppressive to\r\ntheir guest. They had their little round of occupations, charities, and\r\npleasures; Rachel had her poultry-yard and conservatory, and Joshua\r\nhis garden. Besides this, they enjoyed, doubtless, their devotional\r\nmeditations; and, on the whole, time glided softly and imperceptibly\r\non with them, though to me, who long for stream and cataract, it seemed\r\nabsolutely to stand still. I meditated returning to Shepherd\'s Bush, and\r\nbegan to think, with some hankering, after little Benjie and the rod.\r\nThe imp has ventured hither, and hovers about to catch a peep of me\r\nnow and then; I suppose the little sharper is angling for a few more\r\nsixpences. But this would have been, in Joshua\'s eyes, a return of the\r\nwashed sow to wallowing in the mire, and I resolved, while I remained\r\nhis guest, to spare him so violent a shock to his prejudices. The next\r\npoint was, to shorten the time of my proposed stay; but, alas! that I\r\nfelt to be equally impossible. I had named a week; and however rashly my\r\npromise had been pledged, it must be held sacred, even according to the\r\nletter, from which the Friends permit no deviation.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations wrought me up to a kind of impatience yesterday\r\nevening; so that I snatched up my hat, and prepared for a sally beyond\r\nthe cultivated farm and ornamented grounds of Mount Sharon, just as if\r\nI were desirous to escape from the realms of art, into those of free and\r\nunconstrained nature.\r\n\r\nI was scarcely more delighted when I first entered this peaceful\r\ndemesne, than I now was--such is the instability and inconsistency\r\nof human nature!--when I escaped from it to the open downs, which had\r\nformerly seemed so waste and dreary, The air I breathed felt purer and\r\nmore bracing. The clouds, riding high upon a summer breeze, drove, in\r\ngay succession, over my head, now obscuring the sun, now letting its\r\nrays stream in transient flashes upon various parts of the landscape,\r\nand especially upon the broad mirror of the distant Firth of Solway.\r\n\r\nI advanced on the scene with the light step of a liberated captive; and,\r\nlike John Bunyan\'s Pilgrim, could have found in my heart to sing as\r\nI went on my way. It seemed as if my gaiety had accumulated while\r\nsuppressed, and that I was, in my present joyous mood, entitled to\r\nexpend the savings of the previous week. But just as I was about to\r\nuplift a merry stave, I heard, to my joyful surprise, the voices of\r\nthree or more choristers, singing, with considerable success, the lively\r\nold catch,\r\n\r\n  For all our men were very very merry,\r\n    And all our men were drinking:\r\n    There were two men of mine,\r\n    Three men of thine,\r\n  And three that belonged to old Sir Thom o\' Lyne;\r\n  As they went to the ferry, they were very very merry,\r\n    And all our men were drinking.\'\r\n\r\n[The original of this catch is to be found in Cowley\'s witty comedy of\r\nTHE GUARDIAN, the first edition. It does not exist in the second and\r\nrevised edition, called THE CUTTER OF COLEMAN STREET.\r\n\r\n  CAPTAIN BLADE.  Ha, ha, boys, another catch.\r\n             AND ALL OUR MEN ARE VERY VERY MERRY,\r\n             AND ALL OUR MEN WERE DRINKING.\r\n  CUTTER.    ONE MAN OF MINE.\r\n  DOGREL.    TWO MEN OF MINE.\r\n  BLADE.     THREE MEN OF MINE.\r\n  CUTTER.    AND ONE MAN OF MINE.\r\n  OMNES.     AS WE WENT BY THE WAY WE WERE DRUNK, DRUNK, DAMNABLY\r\n             DRUNK, AND ALL OUR MEN WERE VERY VERY MERRY, &c.\r\n\r\nSuch are the words, which are somewhat altered and amplified in the\r\ntext. The play was acted in presence of Charles II, then Prince of\r\nWales, in 1641. The catch in the text has been happily set to music.]\r\n\r\nAs the chorus ended, there followed a loud and hearty laugh by way\r\nof cheers. Attracted by sounds which were so congenial to my present\r\nfeelings, I made towards the spot from which they came,--cautiously,\r\nhowever, for the downs, as had been repeatedly hinted to me, had no good\r\nname; and the attraction of the music, without rivalling that of the\r\nsirens in melody, might have been followed by similarly inconvenient\r\nconsequences to an incautious amateur.\r\n\r\nI crept on, therefore, trusting that the sinuosities of the ground,\r\nbroken as it was into knells and sand-pits, would permit me to obtain\r\na sight of the musicians before I should be observed by them. As I\r\nadvanced, the old ditty was again raised. The voices seemed those of a\r\nman and two boys; they were rough, but kept good time, and were managed\r\nwith too much skill to belong to the ordinary country people.\r\n\r\n  Jack looked at the sun, and cried, Fire, fire, fire;\r\n  Tom stabled his keffel in Birkendale mire;\r\n  Jem started a calf, and halloo\'d for a stag;\r\n  Will mounted a gate-post instead of his nag:\r\n  For all our men were very very merry,\r\n    And all our men were drinking;\r\n      There were two men of mine,\r\n      Three men of thine,\r\n  And three that belonged to old Sir Thom o\' Lyne;\r\n  As they went to the ferry, they were very very merry,\r\n    For all our men were drinking.\r\n\r\nThe voices, as they mixed in their several parts, and ran through them,\r\nuntwisting and again entwining all the links of the merry old catch,\r\nseemed to have a little touch of the bacchanalian spirit which they\r\ncelebrated, and showed plainly that the musicians were engaged in the\r\nsame joyous revel as the MENYIE of old Sir Thom o\' Lyne. At length I\r\ncame within sight of them, three in number, where they sat cosily niched\r\ninto what you might call a BUNKER, a little sand-pit, dry and snug, and\r\nsurrounded by its banks, and a screen of whins in full bloom.\r\n\r\nThe only one of the trio whom I recognized as a personal acquaintance\r\nwas the notorious little Benjie, who, having just finished his stave,\r\nwas cramming a huge luncheon of pie-crust into his mouth with one hand,\r\nwhile in the other he held a foaming tankard, his eyes dancing with all\r\nthe glee of a forbidden revel; and his features, which have at all times\r\na mischievous archness of expression, confessing the full sweetness of\r\nstolen waters, and bread eaten in secret.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the profession of the male and female, who were\r\npartners with Benjie in these merry doings. The man\'s long loose-bodied\r\ngreatcoat (wrap-rascal as the vulgar term it), the fiddle-case, with its\r\nstraps, which lay beside him, and a small knapsack which might contain\r\nhis few necessaries; a clear grey eye; features which, in contending\r\nwith many a storm, had not lost a wild and, careless expression of glee,\r\nanimated at present, when he was exercising for his own pleasure the\r\narts which he usually practised for bread,--all announced one of those\r\nperipatetic followers of Orpheus whom the vulgar call a strolling\r\nfiddler. Gazing more attentively, I easily discovered that though the\r\npoor musician\'s eyes were open, their sense was shut, and that the\r\necstasy with which he turned them up to heaven only derived its apparent\r\nexpression from his own internal emotions, but received no assistance\r\nfrom the visible objects around. Beside him sat his female companion, in\r\na man\'s hat, a blue coat, which seemed also to have been an article of\r\nmale apparel, and a red petticoat. She was cleaner, in person and in\r\nclothes, than such itinerants generally are; and, having been in her day\r\na strapping BONA ROBA, she did not even yet neglect some attention to\r\nher appearance; wore a large amber necklace, and silver ear-rings, and\r\nhad her laid fastened across her breast with a brooch of the same metal.\r\n\r\nThe man also looked clean, notwithstanding the meanness of his attire,\r\nand had a decent silk handkerchief well knotted about his throat, under\r\nwhich peeped a clean owerlay. His beard, also, instead of displaying a\r\ngrizzly stubble, unmowed for several days, flowed in thick and comely\r\nabundance over the breast, to the length of six inches, and mingled with\r\nhis hair, which was but beginning to exhibit a touch of age. To sum up\r\nhis appearance, the loose garment which I have described was secured\r\naround him by a large old-fashioned belt, with brass studs, in\r\nwhich hung a dirk, with a knife and fork, its usual accompaniments.\r\nAltogether, there was something more wild and adventurous-looking about\r\nthe man than I could have expected to see in an ordinary modern crowder;\r\nand the bow which he now and then drew across the violin, to direct his\r\nlittle choir, was decidedly that of no ordinary performer.\r\n\r\nYou must understand that many of these observations were the fruits of\r\nafter remark; for I had scarce approached so near as to get a distinct\r\nview of the party, when my friend Benjie\'s lurching attendant, which he\r\ncalls by the appropriate name of Hemp, began to cock his tail and ears,\r\nand, sensible of my presence, flew, barking like a fury, to the place\r\nwhere I had meant to lie concealed till I heard another song. I was\r\nobliged, however, to jump on my feet, and intimidate Hemp, who would\r\notherwise have bit me, by two sound kicks on the ribs, which sent him\r\nhowling back to his master.\r\n\r\nLittle Benjie seemed somewhat dismayed at my appearance; but,\r\ncalculating on my placability, and remembering, perhaps, that the\r\nill-used Solomon was no palfrey of mine, he speedily affected great\r\nglee, and almost in one breath assured the itinerants that I was \'a\r\ngrand gentleman, and had plenty of money, and was very kind to poor\r\nfolk;\' and informed me that this was \'Willie Steenson--Wandering Willie\r\nthe best fiddler that ever kittled thairm with horse-hair.\'\r\n\r\nThe woman rose and curtsied; and Wandering Willie sanctioned his own\r\npraises with a nod, and the ejaculation, \'All is true that the little\r\nboy says.\'\r\n\r\nI asked him if he was of this country.\r\n\r\n\'THIS country!\' replied the blind man--\'I am of every country in broad\r\nScotland, and a wee bit of England to the boot. But yet I am, in some\r\nsense, of this country; for I was born within hearing of the roar of\r\nSolway. Will I give your honour a touch of the auld bread-winner?\'\r\n\r\nHe preluded as he spoke, in a manner which really excited my curiosity;\r\nand then, taking the old tune of Galashiels for his theme, he graced\r\nit with a number of wild, complicated, and beautiful variations; during\r\nwhich it was wonderful to observe how his sightless face was lighted up\r\nunder the conscious pride and heartfelt delight in the exercise of his\r\nown very considerable powers.\r\n\r\n\'What think you of that, now, for threescore and twa?\'\r\n\r\nI expressed my surprise and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\'A rant, man--an auld rant,\' said Willie; \'naething like the music ye\r\nhae in your ballhouses and your playhouses in Edinbro\'; but it\'s weel\r\naneugh anes in a way at a dykeside. Here\'s another--it\'s no a Scotch\r\ntune, but it passes for ane--Oswald made it himsell, I reckon--he has\r\ncheated mony ane, but he canna cheat Wandering Willie.\'\r\n\r\nHe then played your favourite air of Roslin Castle, with a number of\r\nbeautiful variations, some of which I am certain were almost extempore.\r\n\r\n\'You have another fiddle there, my friend,\' said I--\'Have you a\r\ncomrade?\' But Willie\'s ears were deaf, or his attention was still busied\r\nwith the tune.\r\n\r\nThe female replied in his stead, \'O aye, sir--troth we have a partner--a\r\ngangrel body like oursells. No but my hinny might have been better if he\r\nhad liked; for mony a bein nook in mony a braw house has been offered to\r\nmy hinny Willie, if he wad but just bide still and play to the gentles.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whisht, woman! whisht!\' said the blind man, angrily, shaking his locks;\r\n\'dinna deave the gentleman wi\' your havers. Stay in a house and play to\r\nthe gentles!--strike up when my leddy pleases, and lay down the bow when\r\nmy lord bids! Na, na, that\'s nae life for Willie. Look out, Maggie--peer\r\nout, woman, and see if ye can see Robin coming. Deil be in him! He has\r\ngot to the lee-side of some smuggler\'s punch-bowl, and he wunna budge\r\nthe night, I doubt.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is your consort\'s instrument,\' said I--\' Will you give me leave\r\nto try my skill?\' I slipped at the same time a shilling into the woman\'s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\'I dinna ken whether I dare trust Robin\'s fiddle to ye,\' said Willie,\r\nbluntly. His wife gave him a twitch. \'Hout awa, Maggie,\' he said in\r\ncontempt of the hint; \'though the gentleman may hae gien ye siller, he\r\nmay have nae bowhand for a\' that, and I\'ll no trust Robin\'s fiddle wi\'\r\nan ignoramus. But that\'s no sae muckle amiss,\' he added, as I began to\r\ntouch the instrument; \'I am thinking ye have some skill o\' the craft.\'\r\n\r\nTo confirm him in this favourable opinion, I began to execute such\r\na complicated flourish as I thought must have turned Crowdero into\r\na pillar of stone with envy and wonder. I scaled the top of the\r\nfinger-board, to dive at once to the bottom--skipped with flying\r\nfingers, like Timotheus, from shift to shift--struck arpeggios and\r\nharmonic tones, but without exciting any of the astonishment which I had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nWillie indeed listened to me with considerable attention; but I was no\r\nsooner finished, than he immediately mimicked on his own instrument\r\nthe fantastic complication of tones which I had produced, and made so\r\nwhimsical a parody of my performance, that, although somewhat angry, I\r\ncould not help laughing heartily, in which I was joined by Benjie,\r\nwhose reverence for me held him under no restraint; while the poor dame,\r\nfearful, doubtless, of my taking offence at this familiarity, seemed\r\ndivided betwixt her conjugal reverence for her Willie, and her desire to\r\ngive him a hint for his guidance.\r\n\r\nAt length the old man stopped of his own accord, and, as if he had\r\nsufficiently rebuked me by his mimicry, he said, \'But for a\' that, ye\r\nwill play very weel wi\' a little practice and some gude teaching. But ye\r\nmaun learn to put the heart into it, man--to put the heart into it.\'\r\n\r\nI played an air in simpler taste, and received more decided approbation.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s something like it man. Od, ye are a clever birkie!\'\r\n\r\nThe woman touched his coat again. \'The gentleman is a gentleman,\r\nWillie--ye maunna speak that gate to him, hinnie.\'\r\n\r\n\'The deevil I maunna!\' said Willie; \'and what for maunna I?--If he was\r\nten gentles, he canna draw a bow like me, can he?\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed I cannot, my honest friend,\' said I; \'and if you will go with me\r\nto a house hard by, I would be glad to have a night with you.\'\r\n\r\nHere I looked round, and observed Benjie smothering a laugh, which I was\r\nsure had mischief in it. I seized him suddenly by the ear, and made him\r\nconfess that he was laughing at the thoughts of the reception which a\r\nfiddler was likely to get from the Quakers at Mount Sharon. I chucked\r\nhim from me, not sorry that his mirth had reminded me in time of what I\r\nhad for the moment forgotten; and invited the itinerant to go with me to\r\nShepherd\'s Bush, from which I proposed to send word to Mr. Geddes that\r\nI should not return home that evening. But the minstrel declined this\r\ninvitation also. He was engaged for the night, he said, to a dance in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and vented a round execration on the laziness\r\nor drunkenness of his comrade, who had not appeared at the place of\r\nrendezvous.\r\n\r\n\'I will go with you instead of him,\' said I, in a sudden whim; \'and I\r\nwill give you a crown to introduce me as your comrade.\'\r\n\r\n\'YOU gang instead of Rob the Rambler! My certie, freend, ye are no\r\nblate!\' answered Wandering Willie, in a tone which announced death to my\r\nfrolic.\r\n\r\nBut Maggie, whom the offer of the crown had not escaped, began to open\r\non that scent with a maundering sort of lecture. \'Oh Willie! hinny\r\nWillie, whan will ye learn to be wise? There\'s a crown to be win for\r\nnaething but saying ae man\'s name instead of anither. And, wae\'s me! I\r\nhae just a shilling of this gentleman\'s gieing, and a boddle of my ain;\r\nand ye wunna, bend your will sae muckle as to take up the siller that\'s\r\nflung at your feet! Ye will die the death of a cadger\'s powney, in a\r\nwreath of drift! and what can I do better than lie doun and die wi\' you?\r\nfor ye winna let me win siller to keep either you or mysell leevin.\'\r\n\r\n\'Haud your nonsense tongue, woman,\' said Willie, but less absolutely\r\nthan before. \'Is he a real gentleman, or ane of the player-men?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'se uphaud him a real gentleman,\' said the woman.\r\n\r\n\'I\'se uphaud ye ken little of the matter,\' said Willie; \'let us see haud\r\nof your hand, neebor, gin ye like.\r\n\r\nI gave him my hand. He said to himself, \'Aye, aye, here are fingers that\r\nhave seen canny service.\' Then running his hand over my hair, my face,\r\nand my dress, he went on with his soliloquy; \'Aye, aye, muisted hair,\r\nbraidclaith o\' the best, and seenteen hundred linen on his back, at the\r\nleast o\' it. And how do you think, my braw birkie, that you are to pass\r\nfor a tramping fiddler?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dress is plain,\' said I,--indeed I had chosen my most ordinary suit,\r\nout of compliment to my Quaker friends,--\'and I can easily pass for a\r\nyoung farmer out upon a frolic. Come, I will double the crown I promised\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'Damn your crowns!\' said the disinterested man of music. \'I would like\r\nto have a round wi\' you, that\'s certain;--but a farmer, and with a hand\r\nthat never held pleugh-stilt or pettle, that will never do. Ye may pass\r\nfor a trades-lad from Dumfries, or a student upon the ramble, or the\r\nlike o\' that. But hark ye, lad; if ye expect to be ranting among the\r\nqueans o\' lasses where ye are gaun, ye will come by the waur, I can tell\r\nye; for the fishers are wild chaps, and will bide nae taunts.\'\r\n\r\nI promised to be civil and cautious; and, to smooth the good woman, I\r\nslipped the promised piece into her hand. The acute organs of the blind\r\nman detected this little manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n\'Are ye at it again wi\' the siller, ye jaud? I\'ll be sworn ye wad rather\r\nhear ae twalpenny clink against another, than have a spring from Rory\r\nDall, [Blind Rorie, a famous musician according to tradition.] if\r\nhe was-coming alive again anes errand. Gang doun the gate to Lucky\r\nGregson\'s and get the things ye want, and bide there till ele\'en hours\r\nin the morn; and if you see Robin, send him on to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Am I no gaun to the ploy, then?\' said Maggie, in a disappointed tone.\r\n\r\n\'And what for should ye?\' said her lord and master; \'to dance a\' night,\r\nI\'se warrant, and no to be fit to walk your tae\'s-length the morn, and\r\nwe have ten Scots miles afore us? Na, na. Stable the steed, and pit your\r\nwife to bed, when there\'s night wark to do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aweel, aweel, Willie hinnie, ye ken best; but oh, take an unco care o\'\r\nyoursell, and mind ye haena the blessing o\' sight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your tongue gars me whiles tire of the blessing of hearing, woman,\'\r\nreplied \'Willie, in answer to this tender exhortation.\r\n\r\nBut I now put in for my interest. \'Hollo, good folks, remember that I am\r\nto send the boy to Mount Sharon, and if you go to the Shepherd\'s Bush,\r\nhonest woman, how the deuce am I to guide the blind man where he is\r\ngoing? I know little or nothing of the country.\'\r\n\r\n\'And ye ken mickle less of my hinnie, sir,\' replied Maggie, \'that\r\nthink he needs ony guiding; he\'s the best guide himsell that ye\'ll find\r\nbetween Criffell and Carlisle. Horse-road and foot-path, parish-road\r\nand kirk-road, high-road and cross-road, he kens ilka foot of ground in\r\nNithsdale.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, ye might have said in braid Scotland, gudewife,\' added the\r\nfiddler. \'But gang your ways, Maggie, that\'s the first wise word ye hae\r\nspoke the day. I wish it was dark night, and rain, and wind, for the\r\ngentleman\'s sake, that I might show him there is whiles when ane had\r\nbetter want een than have them; for I am as true a guide by darkness as\r\nby daylight.\'\r\n\r\nInternally as well pleased that my companion was not put to give me this\r\nlast proof of his skill, I wrote a note with a pencil, desiring Samuel\r\nto bring my horses at midnight, when I thought my frolic would be\r\nwellnigh over, to the place to which the bearer should direct him, and I\r\nsent little Benjie with an apology to the worthy Quakers.\r\n\r\nAs we parted in different directions, the good woman said, \'Oh, sir, if\r\nye wad but ask Willie to tell ye ane of his tales to shorten the gate!\r\nHe can speak like ony minister frae the pu\'pit, and he might have been a\r\nminister himsell, but\'--\r\n\r\n\'Haud your tongue, ye fule!\' said Willie,--\'But stay, Meg--gie me\r\na kiss, ne maunna part in anger, neither.\'--And thus our society\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\n[It is certain that in many cases the blind have, by constant exercise\r\nof their other organs, learned to overcome a defect which one would\r\nthink incapable of being supplied. Every reader must remember the\r\ncelebrated Blind Jack of Knaresborough, who lived by laying out roads.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SAME TO THE SAME\r\n\r\nYou are now to conceive us proceeding in our different directions across\r\nthe bare downs. Yonder flies little Benjie to the northward with Hemp\r\nscampering at his heels, both running as if for dear life so long as the\r\nrogue is within sight of his employer, and certain to take the walk very\r\neasy so soon as he is out of ken. Stepping westward, you see Maggie\'s\r\ntall form and high-crowned hat, relieved by the fluttering of her plaid\r\nupon the left shoulder, darkening as the distance diminishes her size\r\nand as the level sunbeams begin to sink upon the sea. She is taking her\r\nquiet journey to the Shepherd\'s Bush.\r\n\r\nThen, stoutly striding over the lea, you have a full view of Darsie\r\nLatimer, with his new acquaintance, Wandering Willie, who, bating that\r\nhe touched the ground now and then with his staff, not in a doubtful\r\ngroping manner, but with the confident air of an experienced pilot,\r\nheaving the lead when he has the soundings by heart, walks as firmly and\r\nboldly as if he possessed the eyes of Argus. There they go, each with\r\nhis violin slung at his back, but one of them at least totally ignorant\r\nwhither their course is directed.\r\n\r\nAnd wherefore did you enter so keenly into such a mad frolic? says\r\nmy wise counsellor.--Why, I think, upon the whole, that as a sense of\r\nloneliness, and a longing for that kindness which is interchanged in\r\nsociety, led me to take up my temporary residence at Mount Sharon, the\r\nmonotony of my life there, the quiet simplicity of the conversation of\r\nthe Geddeses, and the uniformity of their amusements and employments,\r\nwearied out my impatient temper, and prepared me for the first escapade\r\nwhich chance might throw in my way.\r\n\r\nWhat would I have given that I could have procured that solemn grave\r\nvisage of thine, to dignify this joke, as it has done full many a one of\r\nthine own! Thou hast so happy a knack of doing the most foolish things\r\nin the wisest manner, that thou mightst pass thy extravagances for\r\nrational actions, even in the eyes of Prudence herself.\r\n\r\nFrom the direction which my guide observed, I began to suspect that the\r\ndell at Brokenburn was our probable destination; and it became important\r\nto me to consider whether I could, with propriety, or even perfect\r\nsafety, intrude myself again upon the hospitality of my former host. I\r\ntherefore asked Willie whether we were bound for the laird\'s, as folk\r\ncalled him.\r\n\r\n\'Do ye ken the laird?\' said Willie, interrupting a sonata of Corelli, of\r\nwhich he had whistled several bars with great precision.\r\n\r\n\'I know the laird a little,\' said I; \'and therefore I was doubting\r\nwhether I ought to go to his town in disguise.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should doubt, not a little only, but a great deal, before I took ye\r\nthere, my chap,\' said Wandering Willie; \'for I am thinking it wad be\r\nworth little less than broken banes baith to you and me. Na, na,\r\nchap, we are no ganging to the laird\'s, but to a blithe birling at the\r\nBrokenburn-foot, where there will be mony a braw lad and lass; and\r\nmaybe there may be some of the laird\'s folks, for he never comes to sic\r\nsplores himsell. He is all for fowling-piece and salmon-spear, now that\r\npike and musket are out of the question.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has been at soldier, then?\' said I.\r\n\r\n\'I\'se warrant him a soger,\' answered Willie; \'but take my advice, and\r\nspeer as little about him as he does about you. Best to let sleeping\r\ndogs lie. Better say naething about the laird, my man, and tell me\r\ninstead, what sort of a chap ye are that are sae ready to cleik in with\r\nan auld gaberlunzie fiddler? Maggie says ye\'re gentle, but a shilling\r\nmaks a\' the difference that Maggie kens between a gentle and a semple,\r\nand your crowns wad mak ye a prince of the blood in her een. But I am\r\nane that ken full weel that ye may wear good claithes, and have a saft\r\nhand, and yet that may come of idleness as weel as gentrice.\'\r\n\r\nI told him my name, with the same addition I had formerly given to\r\nMr. Joshua Geddes; that I was a law-student, tired of my studies, and\r\nrambling about for exercise and amusement.\r\n\r\n\'And are ye in the wont of drawing up wi\' a\' the gangrel bodies that\r\nye meet on the high-road, or find cowering in a sand-bunker upon the\r\nlinks?\' demanded Willie.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no; only with honest folks like yourself, Willie,\' was my reply.\r\n\r\n\'Honest folks like me! How do ye ken whether I am honest, or what I am?\r\nI may be the deevil himsell for what ye ken; for he has power to come\r\ndisguised like an angel of light; and besides he is a prime fiddler. He\r\nplayed a sonata to Corelli, ye ken.\'\r\n\r\nThere was something odd in this speech, and the tone in which it was\r\nsaid. It seemed as if my companion was not always in his constant mind,\r\nor that he was willing to try if he could frighten me. I laughed at the\r\nextravagance of his language, however, and asked him in reply, if he\r\nwas fool enough to believe that the foul fiend would play so silly a\r\nmasquerade.\r\n\r\n\'Ye ken little about it--little about it,\' said the old man, shaking his\r\nhead and beard, and knitting his brows, \'I could tell ye something about\r\nthat.\'\r\n\r\nWhat his wife mentioned of his being a tale-teller, as well as\r\na musician, now occurred to me; and as you know I like tales of\r\nsuperstition, I begged to have a specimen of his talent as we went\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\'It is very true,\' said the blind man, \'that when I am tired of scraping\r\nthairm or singing ballants, I whiles mak a tale serve the turn among\r\nthe country bodies; and I have some fearsome anes, that make the auld\r\ncarlines shake on the settle, and the bits o\' bairns skirl on their\r\nminnies out frae their beds. But this that I am gaun to tell you was\r\na thing that befell in our ain house in my father\'s time--that is, my\r\nfather was then a hafflins callant; and I tell it to you that it may be\r\na lesson to you, that are but a young, thoughtless chap, wha ye draw up\r\nwi\' on a lonely road; for muckle was the dool and care that came o\'t to\r\nmy gudesire.\'\r\n\r\nHe commenced his tale accordingly, in a distinct narrative tone of voice\r\nwhich he raised and depressed with considerable skill; at times sinking\r\nalmost into a whisper, and turning his clear but sightless eyeballs upon\r\nmy face, as if it had been possible for him to witness the impression\r\nwhich his narrative made upon my features. I will not spare you a\r\nsyllable of it, although it be of the longest; so I make a dash--and\r\nbegin\r\n\r\nWANDERING WILLIE\'S TALE.\r\n\r\nYe maun have heard of Sir Robert Redgauntlet of that Ilk, who lived in\r\nthese parts before the dear years. The country will lang mind him; and\r\nour fathers used to draw breath thick if ever they heard him named. He\r\nwas out wi\' the Hielandmen in Montrose\'s time; and again he was in the\r\nhills wi\' Glencairn in the saxteen hundred and fifty-twa; and sae when\r\nKing Charles the Second came in, wha was in sic favour as the Laird of\r\nRedgauntlet? He was knighted at Lonon court, wi\' the king\'s ain sword;\r\nand being a redhot prelatist, he came down here, rampauging like a lion,\r\nwith commissions of lieutenancy (and of lunacy, for what I ken) to put\r\ndown a\' the Whigs and Covenanters in the country. Wild wark they made of\r\nit; for the Whigs were as dour as the Cavaliers were fierce, and it was\r\nwhich should first tire the other. Redgauntlet was ay for the strong\r\nhand; and his name is kend as wide in the country as Claverhouse\'s or\r\nTam Dalyell\'s. Glen, nor dargle, nor mountain, nor cave, could hide the\r\npuir hill-folk when Redgauntlet was out with bugle and bloodhound after\r\nthem, as if they had been sae mony deer. And troth when they fand them,\r\nthey didna mak muckle mair ceremony than a Hielandman wi\' a\r\nroebuck--it was just, \'Will ye tak the test?\'--if not, \'Make\r\nready--present--fire!\'--and there lay the recusant.\r\n\r\nFar and wide was Sir Robert hated and feared. Men thought he had a\r\ndirect compact with Satan--that he was proof against steel--and that\r\nbullets happed aff his buff-coat like hailstanes from a hearth--that\r\nhe had a mear that would turn a hare on the side of Carrifra-gawns [A\r\nprecipitous side of a mountain in Moffatdale.]--and muckle to the same\r\npurpose, of whilk mair anon. The best blessing they wared on him was,\r\n\'Deil scowp wi\' Redgauntlet!\' He wasna a bad master to his ain folk,\r\nthough, and was weel aneugh liked by his tenants; and as for the lackies\r\nand troopers that raid out wi\' him to the persecutions, as the Whigs\r\ncaa\'d those killing times, they wad hae drunken themsells blind to his\r\nhealth at ony time.\r\n\r\nNow you are to ken that my gudesire lived on Redgauntlet\'s grund--they\r\nca\' the place Primrose Knowe. We had lived on the grund, and under the\r\nRedgauntlets, since the riding days, and lang before. It was a pleasant\r\nbit; and I think the air is callerer and fresher there than onywhere\r\nelse in the country. It\'s a\' deserted now; and I sat on the broken\r\ndoor-cheek three days since, and was glad I couldna see the plight the\r\nplace was in; but that\'s a\' wide o\' the mark. There dwelt my gudesire,\r\nSteenie Steenson, a rambling, rattling chiel\' he had been in his young\r\ndays, and could play weel on the pipes; he was famous at \'Hoopers and\r\nGirders\'--a\' Cumberland couldna, touch him at \'Jockie Lattin\'--and he\r\nhad the finest finger for the back-lilt between Berwick and Carlisle.\r\nThe like o\' Steenie wasna the sort that they made Whigs o\'. And so he\r\nbecame a Tory, as they ca\' it, which we now ca\' Jacobites, just out of a\r\nkind of needcessity, that he might belang to some side or other. He had\r\nnae ill will to the Whig bodies, and liked little to see the blude rin,\r\nthough, being obliged to follow Sir Robert in hunting and hoisting,\r\nwatching and warding, he saw muckle mischief, and maybe did some, that\r\nhe couldna avoid.\r\n\r\nNow Steenie was a kind of favourite with his master, and kend a\' the\r\nfolks about the castle, and was often sent for to play the pipes when\r\nthey were at their merriment. Auld Dougal MacCallum, the butler, that\r\nhad followed Sir Robert through gude and ill, thick and thin, pool and\r\nstream, was specially fond of the pipes, and ay gae my gudesire his gude\r\nword wi\' the laird; for Dougal could turn his master round his finger.\r\n\r\nWeel, round came the Revolution, and it had like to have broken\r\nthe hearts baith of Dougal and his master. But the change was not\r\na\'thegether sae great as they feared, and other folk thought for. The\r\nWhigs made an unco crawing what they wad do with their auld enemies, and\r\nin special wi\' Sir Robert Redgauntlet. But there were ower mony great\r\nfolks dipped in the same doings, to mak a spick and span new warld. So\r\nParliament passed it a\' ower easy; and Sir Robert, bating that he was\r\nheld to hunting foxes instead of Covenanters, remained just the man he\r\nwas. [The caution and moderation of King William III, and his principles\r\nof unlimited toleration, deprived the Cameronians of the opportunity\r\nthey ardently desired, to retaliate the injuries which they had received\r\nduring the reign of prelacy, and purify the land, as they called it,\r\nfrom the pollution of blood. They esteemed the Revolution, therefore,\r\nonly a half measure, which neither comprehended the rebuilding the Kirk\r\nin its full splendour, nor the revenge of the death of the Saints on\r\ntheir persecutors.] His revel was as loud, and his hall as weel\r\nlighted, as ever it had been, though maybe he lacked the fines of the\r\nnonconformists, that used to come to stock his larder and cellar; for it\r\nis certain he began to be keener about the rents than his tenants used\r\nto find him before, and they behoved to be prompt to the rent-day,\r\nor else the laird wasna pleased. And he was sic an awsome body, that\r\nnaebody cared to anger him; for the oaths he swore, and the rage that he\r\nused to get into, and the looks that he put on, made men sometimes think\r\nhim a devil incarnate.\r\n\r\nWeel, my gudesire was nae manager--no that he was a very great\r\nmisguider--but he hadna the saving gift, and he got twa terms\' rent in\r\narrear. He got the first brash at Whitsunday put ower wi\' fair word\r\nand piping; but when Martinmas came, there was a summons from the\r\ngrund-officer to come wi\' the rent on a day preceese, or else Steenie\r\nbehoved to flit. Sair wark he had to get the siller; but he was\r\nweel-freended, and at last he got the haill scraped thegether--a\r\nthousand merks--the maist of it was from a neighbour they ca\'d Laurie\r\nLapraik--a sly tod. Laurie had walth o\' gear--could hunt wi\' the hound\r\nand rin wi\' the hare--and be Whig or Tory, saunt or sinner, as the wind\r\nstood. He was a professor in this Revolution warld, but he liked an orra\r\nsough of this warld, and a tune on the pipes weel aneugh at a bytime;\r\nand abune a\', he thought he had gude security for the siller he lent my\r\ngudesire ower the stocking at Primrose Knowe.\r\n\r\nAway trots my gudesire to Redgauntlet Castle wi\' a heavy purse and a\r\nlight heart, glad to be out of the laird\'s danger. Weel, the first thing\r\nhe learned at the castle was, that Sir Robert had fretted himsell into\r\na fit of the gout, because he did not appear before twelve\' o\'clock. It\r\nwasna a\'thegether for sake of the money, Dougal thought; but because he\r\ndidna like to part wi\' my gudesire aff the grund. Dougal was glad to see\r\nSteenie, and brought him into the great oak parlour, and there sat\r\nthe laird his leesome lane, excepting that he had beside him a great,\r\nill-favoured jackanape, that was a special pet of his; a cankered beast\r\nit was, and mony an ill-natured trick it played--ill to please it was,\r\nand easily angered--ran about the haill castle, chattering and yowling,\r\nand pinching, and biting folk, specially before ill weather, or\r\ndisturbances in the state. Sir Robert caa\'d it Major Weir, after the\r\nwarlock that was burnt; [A celebrated wizard, executed at Edinburgh for\r\nsorcery and other crimes.] and few folk liked either the name or the\r\nconditions of the creature--they thought there was something in it by\r\nordinar--and my gudesire was not just easy in mind when the door shut\r\non him, and he saw himself in the room wi\' naebody but the laird, Dougal\r\nMacCallum, and the major, a thing that hadna chanced to him before.\r\n\r\nSir Robert sat, or, I should say, lay, in a great armed chair, wi\' his\r\ngrand velvet gown, and his feet on a cradle; for he had baith gout and\r\ngravel, and his face looked as gash and ghastly as Satan\'s. Major Weir\r\nsat opposite to him, in a red laced coat, and the laird\'s wig on his\r\nhead; and ay as Sir Robert girned wi\' pain, the jackanape girned too,\r\nlike a sheep\'s-head between a pair of tangs--an ill-faur\'d, fearsome\r\ncouple they were. The laird\'s buff-coat was hung on a pin behind him,\r\nand his broadsword and his pistols within reach; for he keepit up the\r\nauld fashion of having the weapons ready, and a horse saddled day and\r\nnight, just as he used to do when he was able to loup on horseback, and\r\naway after ony of the hill-folk he could get speerings of. Some said it\r\nwas for fear of the Whigs taking vengeance, but I judge it was just his\r\nauld custom--he wasna, gien to fear onything. The rental-book, wi\'\r\nits black cover and brass clasps, was lying beside him; and a book of\r\nsculduddry sangs was put betwixt the leaves, to keep it open at the\r\nplace where it bore evidence against the Goodman of Primrose Knowe, as\r\nbehind the hand with his mails and duties. Sir Robert gave my gudesire\r\na look, as if he would have withered his heart in his bosom. Ye maun ken\r\nhe had a way of bending his brows, that men saw the visible mark of a\r\nhorseshoe in his forehead, deep dinted, as if it had been stamped there.\r\n\r\n\'Are ye come light-handed, ye son of a toom whistle?\' said Sir Robert.\r\n\'Zounds! if you are\'--\r\n\r\nMy gudesire, with as gude acountenance as he could put on, made a leg,\r\nand placed the bag of money on the table wi\' a dash, like a man that\r\ndoes something clever. The laird drew it to him hastily--\'Is it all\r\nhere, Steenie, man?\'\r\n\r\n\'Your honour will find it right,\' said my gudesire.\r\n\r\n\'Here, Dougal,\' said the laird, \'gie Steenie a tass of brandy\r\ndownstairs, till I count the siller and write the receipt.\'\r\n\r\nBut they werena weel out of the room, when Sir Robert gied a\r\nyelloch that garr\'d the castle rock. Back ran Dougal--in flew the\r\nlivery-men--yell on yell gied the laird, ilk ane mair awfu\' than the\r\nither. My gudesire knew not whether to stand or flee, but he ventured\r\nback into the parlour, where a\' was gaun hirdy-girdie--naebody to say\r\n\'come in,\' or \'gae out.\' Terribly the laird roared for cauld water to\r\nhis feet, and wine to cool his throat; and Hell, hell, hell, and its\r\nflames, was ay the word in his mouth. They brought him water, and when\r\nthey plunged his swollen feet into the tub, he cried out it was burning;\r\nand folk say that it DID bubble and sparkle like a seething cauldron. He\r\nflung the cup at Dougal\'s head, and said he had given him blood instead\r\nof burgundy; and, sure aneugh, the lass washed clotted blood aff the\r\ncarpet; the neist day. The jackanape they caa\'d Major Weir, it jibbered\r\nand cried as if it was mocking its master; my gudesire\'s head was like\r\nto turn--he forgot baith siller and receipt, and downstairs he\r\nbanged; but as he ran, the shrieks came faint and fainter; there was a\r\ndeep-drawn shivering groan, and word gaed through the castle that the\r\nlaird was dead.\r\n\r\nWeel, away came my gudesire, wi\' his finger in his mouth, and his best\r\nhope was that Dougal had seen the money-bag, and heard the laird\r\nspeak of writing the receipt. The young laird, now Sir John, came from\r\nEdinburgh, to see things put to rights. Sir John and his father never\r\ngree\'d weel. Sir John had been bred an advocate, and afterwards sat in\r\nthe last Scots Parliament and voted for the Union, having gotten, it was\r\nthought, a rug of the compensations--if his father could have come out\r\nof his grave, he would have brained him for it on his awn hearthstane.\r\nSome thought it was easier counting with the auld rough knight than the\r\nfair-spoken young ane--but mair of that anon.\r\n\r\nDougal MacCallum, poor body, neither grat nor grained, but gaed about\r\nthe house looking like a corpse, but directing, as was his duty, a\'\r\nthe order of the grand funeral. Now Dougal looked ay waur and waur when\r\nnight was coming, and was ay the last to gang to his bed, whilk was in\r\na little round just opposite the chamber of dais, whilk his master\r\noccupied while he was living, and where he now lay in state, as they\r\ncaa\'d it, weel-a-day! The night before the funeral, Dougal could keep\r\nhis awn counsel nae langer; he came doun with his proud spirit, and\r\nfairly asked auld Hutcheon to sit in his room with him for an hour. When\r\nthey were in the round, Dougal took ae tass of brandy to himsell, and\r\ngave another to Hutcheon, and wished him all health and lang life, and\r\nsaid that, for himsell, he wasna lang for this world; for that, every\r\nnight since Sir Robert\'s death, his silver call had sounded from the\r\nstate chamber, just as it used to do at nights in his lifetime, to call\r\nDougal to help to turn him in his bed. Dougal said that being alone\r\nwith the dead on that floor of the tower (for naebody cared to wake Sir\r\nRobert Redgauntlet like another corpse) he had never daured to answer\r\nthe call, but that now his conscience checked him for neglecting his\r\nduty; for, \'though death breaks service,\' said MacCallum, \'it shall\r\nnever break my service to Sir Robert; and I will answer his next\r\nwhistle, so be you will stand by me, Hutcheon.\'\r\n\r\nHutcheon had nae will to the wark, but he had stood by Dougal in battle\r\nand broil, and he wad not fail him at this pinch; so down the carles\r\nsat ower a stoup of brandy, and Hutcheon, who was something of a clerk,\r\nwould have read a chapter of the Bible; but Dougal would hear naething\r\nbut a blaud of Davie Lindsay, whilk was the waur preparation.\r\n\r\nWhen midnight came, and the house was quiet as the grave, sure enough\r\nthe silver whistle sounded as sharp and shrill as if Sir Robert was\r\nblowing it, and up got the twa auld serving-men, and tottered into the\r\nroom where the dead man lay. Hutcheon saw aneugh at the first glance;\r\nfor there were torches in the room, which showed him the foul fiend, in\r\nhis ain shape, sitting on the laird\'s coffin! Ower he cowped as if he\r\nhad been dead. He could not tell how lang he lay in a trance at the\r\ndoor, but when he gathered himself, he cried on his neighbour, and\r\ngetting nae answer, raised the house, when Dougal was found lying dead\r\nwithin twa steps of the bed where his master\'s coffin was placed. As for\r\nthe whistle, it was gaen anes and ay; but mony a time was it heard at\r\nthe top of the house on the bartizan, and amang the auld chimneys and\r\nturrets where the howlets have their nests. Sir John hushed the matter\r\nup, and the funeral passed over without mair bogle-wark.\r\n\r\nBut when a\' was ower, and the laird was beginning to settle his affairs,\r\nevery tenant was called up for his arrears, and my gudesire for the full\r\nsum that stood against him in the rental-book. Weel, away he trots to\r\nthe castle, to tell his story, and there he is introduced to Sir John,\r\nsitting in his father\'s chair, in deep mourning, with weepers and\r\nhanging cravat, and a small wallring rapier by his side, instead of the\r\nauld broadsword that had a hundredweight of steel about it, what with\r\nblade, chape, and basket-hilt. I have heard their communing so often\r\ntauld ower, that I almost think I was there mysell, though I couldna\r\nbe born at the time. (In fact, Alan, my companion mimicked, with a\r\ngood deal of humour, the flattering, conciliating tone of the tenant\'s\r\naddress, and the hypocritical melancholy of the laird\'s reply. His\r\ngrandfather, he said, had, while he spoke, his eye fixed on the\r\nrental-book, as if it were a mastiff-dog that he was afraid would spring\r\nup and bite him).\r\n\r\n\'I wuss ye joy, sir, of the head seat, and the white loaf, and the braid\r\nlairdship. Your father was a kind man to friends and followers; muckle\r\ngrace to you, Sir John, to fill his shoon--his boots, I suld say, for he\r\nseldom wore shoon, unless it were muils when he had the gout.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, Steenie,\' quoth the laird, sighing deeply, and putting his\r\nnapkin to his een, \'his was a sudden call, and he will be missed in the\r\ncountry; no time to set his house in order--weel prepared Godward, no\r\ndoubt, which is the root of the matter--but left us behind a tangled\r\nheap to wind, Steenie.--Hem! hem! We maun go to business, Steenie; much\r\nto do, and little time to do it in.\'\r\n\r\nHere he opened the fatal volume. I have heard of a thing they call\r\nDoomsday Book--I am clear it has been a rental of back-ganging tenants.\r\n\r\n\'Stephen,\' said Sir John, still in the same soft, sleekit tone of\r\nvoice--\'Stephen Stevenson, or Steenson, ye are down here for a year\'s\r\nrent behind the hand--due at last term.\'\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN. \'Please your honour, Sir John, I paid it to your father.\'\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN. \'Ye took a receipt, then, doubtless, Stephen; and can produce\r\nit?\'\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN. \'Indeed I hadna time, an it like your honour; for nae sooner\r\nhad I set doun the siller, and just as his honour, Sir Robert, that\'s\r\ngaen, drew it till him to count it, and write out the receipt, he was\r\nta\'en wi\' the pains that removed him.\'\r\n\r\n\'That was unlucky,\' said Sir John, after a pause. \'But ye maybe paid\r\nit in the presence of somebody, I want but a TALIS QUALIS evidence,\r\nStephen. I would go ower strictly to work with no poor man.\'\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN. \'Troth, Sir John, there was naebody in the room but Dougal\r\nMacCallum the butler. But, as your honour kens, he has e\'en followed his\r\nauld master.\r\n\r\n\'Very unlucky again, Stephen,\' said Sir John, without altering his voice\r\na single note. \'The man to whom ye paid the money is dead--and the man\r\nwho witnessed the payment is dead too--and the siller, which should have\r\nbeen to the fore, is neither seen nor heard tell of in the repositories.\r\nHow am I to believe a\' this?\'\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN. \'I dinna, ken, your honour; but there is a bit memorandum\r\nnote of the very coins; for, God help me! I had to borrow out of twenty\r\npurses; and I am sure that ilka man there set down will take his grit\r\noath for what purpose I borrowed the money.\'\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN. \'I have little doubt ye BORROWED the money, Steenie. It is the\r\nPAYMENT to my father that I want to have some proof of.\'\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN. \'The siller maun be about the house, Sir John. And since your\r\nhonour never got it, and his honour that was canna have taen it wi\' him,\r\nmaybe some of the family may have seen it.\'\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN. \'We will examine the servants, Stephen; that is but\r\nreasonable.\'\r\n\r\nBut lackey and lass, and page and groom, all denied stoutly that they\r\nhad ever seen such a bag of money as my gudesire described. What was\r\nwaur, he had unluckily not mentioned to any living soul of them his\r\npurpose of paying his rent. Ae quean had noticed something under his\r\narm, but she took it for the pipes.\r\n\r\nSir John Redgauntlet ordered the servants out of the room, and then said\r\nto my gudesire, \'Now, Steenie, ye see ye have fair play; and, as I have\r\nlittle doubt ye ken better where to find the siller than ony other body,\r\nI beg, in fair terms, and for your own sake, that you will end this\r\nfasherie; for, Stephen, ye maun pay or flit.\'\r\n\r\n\'The Lord forgie your opinion,\' said Stephen, driven almost to his wit\'s\r\nend--\'I am an honest man.\'\r\n\r\n\'So am I, Stephen,\' said his honour; \'and so are all the folks in the\r\nhouse, I hope. But if there be a knave amongst us, it must be he that\r\ntells the story he cannot prove.\' He paused, and then added, mair\r\nsternly, \'If I understand your trick, sir, you want to take advantage\r\nof some malicious reports concerning things in this family, and\r\nparticularly respecting my father\'s sudden death, thereby to cheat me\r\nout of the money, and perhaps take away my character, by insinuating\r\nthat I have received the rent I am demanding. Where do you suppose this\r\nmoney to be? I insist upon knowing.\'\r\n\r\nMy gudesire saw everything look so muckle against him, that he grew\r\nnearly desperate--however, he shifted from one foot to another, looked\r\nto every corner of the room, and made no answer.\r\n\r\n\'Speak out, sirrah,\' said the laird, assuming a look of his father\'s, a\r\nvery particular ane, which he had when he was angry--it seemed as if the\r\nwrinkles of his frown made that selfsame fearful shape of a horse\'s\r\nshoe in the middle of his brow;--\'Speak out, sir! I WILL know your\r\nthoughts;--do you suppose that I have this money?\'\r\n\r\n\'Far be it frae me to say so,\' said Stephen.\r\n\r\n\'Do you charge any of my people with having taken it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I wad be laith to charge them that may be innocent,\' said my gudesire;\r\n\'and if there be any one that is guilty, I have nae proof.\'\r\n\r\n\'Somewhere the money must be, if there is a word of truth in your\r\nstory,\' said Sir John; \'I ask where you think it is--and demand a\r\ncorrect answer?\'\r\n\r\n\'In HELL, if you will have my thoughts of it,\' said my gudesire, driven\r\nto extremity, \'in hell! with your father, his jackanape, and his silver\r\nwhistle.\'\r\n\r\nDown the stairs he ran (for the parlour was nae place for him after such\r\na word) and he heard the laird swearing blood and wounds behind him,\r\nas fast; as ever did Sir Robert, and roaring for the bailie and the\r\nbaron-officer.\r\n\r\nAway rode my gudesire to his chief creditor (him they ca\'d Laurie\r\nLapraik) to try if he could make onything out of him; but when he tauld\r\nhis story, he got but the worst word in his wame--thief, beggar, and\r\ndyvour, were the saftest terms; and to the boot of these hard terms,\r\nLaurie brought up the auld story of his dipping his hand in the blood\r\nof God\'s saunts, just as if a tenant could have helped riding with the\r\nlaird, and that a laird like Sir Robert Redgauntlet. My gudesire was, by\r\nthis time, far beyond the bounds of patience, and, while he and\r\nLaurie were at deil speed the liars, he was wanchancie aneugh to abuse\r\nLapraik\'s doctrine as weel as the man, ond said things that garr\'d\r\nfolks\' flesh grue that heard them;--he wasna just himsell, and he had\r\nlived wi\' a wild set in his day.\r\n\r\nAt last they parted, and my gudesire was to ride hame through the wood\r\nof Pitmurkie, that is a\' fou of black firs, as they say.--I ken the\r\nwood, but the firs may be black or white for what I can tell.--At the\r\nentry of the wood there is a wild common, and on the edge of the common,\r\na little lonely change-house, that was keepit then by an ostler-wife,\r\nthey suld hae caa\'d her Tibbie Faw, and there puir Steenie cried for a\r\nmutchkin of brandy, for he had had no refreshment the haill day. Tibbie\r\nwas earnest wi\' him to take a bite of meat, but he couldna think o\'t,\r\nnor would he take his foot out of the stirrup, and took off the brandy\r\nwholely at twa draughts, and named a toast at each:--the first was the\r\nmemory of Sir Robert Redgauntlet, and might he never lie quiet in his\r\ngrave till he had righted his poor bond-tenant; and the second was a\r\nhealth to Man\'s Enemy, if he would but get him back the pock of siller\r\nor tell him what came o\'t, for he saw the haill world was like to regard\r\nhim as a thief and a cheat, and he took that waur than even the ruin of\r\nhis house and hauld.\r\n\r\nOn he rode, little caring where. It was a dark night turned, and the\r\ntrees made it yet darker, and he let the beast take its ain road through\r\nthe wood; when all of a sudden, from tired and wearied that it was\r\nbefore, the nag began to spring and flee, and stend, that my gudesire\r\ncould hardly keep the saddle. Upon the whilk, a horseman, suddenly\r\nriding up beside him, said, \'That\'s a mettle beast of yours, freend;\r\nwill you sell him?\' So saying, he touched the horse\'s neck with his\r\nriding-wand, and it fell into its auld heigh-ho of a stumbling trot.\r\n\'But his spunk\'s soon out of him, I think,\' continued the stranger, \'and\r\nthat is like mony a man\'s courage, that thinks he wad do great things\r\ntill he come to the proof.\'\r\n\r\nMy gudesire scarce listened to this, but spurred his horse, with \'Gude\r\ne\'en to you, freend.\'\r\n\r\nBut it\'s like the stranger was ane that doesna lightly yield his point;\r\nfor, ride as Steenie liked, he was ay beside him at the selfsame pace.\r\nAt last my gudesire, Steenie Steenson, grew half angry, and, to say the\r\ntruth, half feared.\r\n\r\n\'What is it that ye want with me, freend?\' he said. \'If ye be a robber,\r\nI have nae money; if ye be a leal man, wanting company, I have nae heart\r\nto mirth or speaking; and if ye want to ken the road, I scarce ken it\r\nmysell.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you will tell me your grief,\' said the stranger, \'I am one that,\r\nthough I have been sair miscaa\'d in the world, am the only hand for\r\nhelping my freends.\'\r\n\r\nSo my gudesire, to ease his ain heart, mair than from any hope of help,\r\ntold him the story from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a hard pinch,\' said the stranger; \'but I think I can help you.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you could lend the money, sir, and take a lang day--I ken nae other\r\nhelp on earth,\' said my gudesire.\r\n\r\n\'But there may be some under the earth,\' said the stranger. \'Come, I\'ll\r\nbe frank wi\' you; I could lend you the money on bond, but you would\r\nmaybe scruple my terms. Now, I can tell you, that your auld laird is\r\ndisturbed in his grave by your curses, and the wailing of your family,\r\nand if ye daur venture to go to see him, he will give you the receipt.\'\r\n\r\nMy gudesire\'s hair stood on end at this proposal, but he thought his\r\ncompanion might be some humoursome chield that was trying to frighten\r\nhim, and might end with lending him the money. Besides, he was bauld wi\'\r\nbrandy, and desperate wi\' distress; and he said he had courage to go\r\nto the gate of hell, and a step farther, for that receipt. The stranger\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nWeel, they rode on through the thickest of the wood, when, all of a\r\nsudden, the horse stopped at the door of a great house; and, but that he\r\nknew the place was ten miles off, my father would have thought he was\r\nat Redgauntlet Castle. They rode into the outer courtyard, through the\r\nmuckle faulding yetts and aneath the auld portcullis; and the whole\r\nfront of the house was lighted, and there were pipes and fiddles, and\r\nas much dancing and deray within as used to be at Sir Robert\'s house at\r\nPace and Yule, and such high seasons. They lap off, and my gudesire, as\r\nseemed to him, fastened his horse to the very ring he had tied him to\r\nthat morning, when he gaed to wait on the young Sir John.\r\n\r\n\'God!\' said my gudesire, \'if Sir Robert\'s death be but a dream!\'\r\n\r\nHe knocked at the ha\' door just as he was wont, and his auld\r\nacquaintance, Dougal MacCallum--just after his wont, too,--came to open\r\nthe door, and said, \'Piper Steenie, are ye there, lad? Sir Robert has\r\nbeen crying for you.\'\r\n\r\nMy gudesire was like a man in a dream--he looked for the stranger, but\r\nhe was gane for the time. At last he just tried to say, \'Ha! Dougal\r\nDriveower, are ye living? I thought ye had been dead.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never fash yoursell wi\' me,\' said Dougal, \'but look to yoursell; and\r\nsee ye tak naethlng frae ony body here, neither meat, drink, or siller,\r\nexcept just the receipt that is your ain.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he led the way out through halls and trances that were weel\r\nkend to my gudesire, and into the auld oak parlour; and there was as\r\nmuch singing of profane sangs, and birling of red wine, and speaking\r\nblasphemy and sculduddry, as had ever been in Redgauntlet Castle when it\r\nwas at the blithest.\r\n\r\nBut, Lord take us in keeping, what a set of ghastly revellers they were\r\nthat sat around that table! My gudesire kend mony that had long before\r\ngane to their place, for often had he piped to the most part in the\r\nhall of Redgauntlet. There was the fierce Middleton, and the dissolute\r\nRothes, and the crafty Lauderdale; and Dalyell, with his bald head and\r\na beard to his girdle; and Earlshall, with Cameron\'s blude on his hand;\r\nand wild Bonshaw, that tied blessed Mr. Cargill\'s limbs till the blude\r\nsprung; and Dunbarton Douglas, the twice-turned traitor baith to country\r\nand king. There was the Bluidy Advocate MacKenyie, who, for his worldly\r\nwit and wisdom had been to the rest as a god. And there was Claverhouse,\r\nas beautiful as when he lived, with his long, dark, curled locks\r\nstreaming down over his laced buff-coat, and his left hand always on his\r\nright spule-blade, to hide the wound that the silver bullet had made.\r\n[See Note 2.] He sat apart from them all, and looked at them with a\r\nmelancholy, haughty countenance; while the rest hallooed, and sang, and\r\nlaughed, that the room rang. But their smiles were fearfully contorted\r\nfrom time to time; and their laugh passed into such wild sounds as made\r\nmy gudesire\'s very nails grow blue, and chilled the marrow in his banes.\r\n\r\nThey that waited at the table were just the wicked serving-men and\r\ntroopers, that had done their work and cruel bidding on earth. There\r\nwas the Lang Lad of the Nethertown, that helped to take Argyle; and\r\nthe bishop\'s summoner, that they called the Deil\'s Rattle-bag; and the\r\nwicked guardsmen in their laced coats; and the savage Highland Amorites,\r\nthat shed blood like water; and many a proud serving-man, haughty of\r\nheart and bloody of hand, cringing to the rich, and making them wickeder\r\nthan they would be; grinding the poor to powder, when the rich had\r\nbroken them to fragments. And mony, mony mair were coming and ganging,\r\na\' as busy in their vocation as if they had been alive.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Redgauntlet, in the midst of a\' this fearful riot, cried, wi\'\r\na voice like thunder, on Steenie Piper to come to the board-head where\r\nhe was sitting; his legs stretched out before him, and swathed up with\r\nflannel, with his holster pistols aside him, while the great broadsword\r\nrested against his chair, just as my gudesire had seen him the last time\r\nupon earth--the very cushion for the jackanape was close to him, but the\r\ncreature itself was not there--it wasna its hour, it\'s likely; for he\r\nheard them say as he came forward, \'Is not the major come yet?\' And\r\nanother answered, \'The jackanape will be here betimes the morn.\' And\r\nwhen my gudesire came forward, Sir Robert, or his ghaist, or the deevil\r\nin his likeness, said, \'Weel, piper, hae ye settled wi\' my son for the\r\nyear\'s rent?\'\r\n\r\nWith much ado my father gat breath to say that Sir John would not settle\r\nwithout his honour\'s receipt.\r\n\r\n\'Ye shall hae that for a tune of the pipes, Steenie,\' said the\r\nappearance of Sir Robert--\'Play us up "Weel hoddled, Luckie".\'\r\n\r\nNow this was a tune my gudesire learned frae a warlock, that heard it\r\nwhen they were worshipping Satan at their meetings, and my gudesire had\r\nsometimes played it at the ranting suppers in Redgauntlet Castle, but\r\nnever very willingly; and now he grew cauld at the very name of it, and\r\nsaid, for excuse, he hadna his pipes wi\' him.\r\n\r\n\'MacCallum, ye limb of Beelzebub,\' said the fearfu\' Sir Robert, \'bring\r\nSteenie the pipes that I am keeping for him!\'\r\n\r\nMacCallum brought a pair of pipes might have served the piper of Donald\r\nof the Isles. But he gave my gudesire a nudge as he offered them; and\r\nlooking secretly and closely, Steenie saw that the chanter was of steel,\r\nand heated to a white heat; so he had fair warning not to trust his\r\nfingers with it. So he excused himself again, and said he was faint and\r\nfrightened, and had not wind aneugh to fill the bag.\r\n\r\n\'Then ye maun eat and drink, Steenie,\' said the figure; \'for we\r\ndo little else here; and it\'s ill speaking between a fou man and a\r\nfasting.\'\r\n\r\nNow these were the very words that the bloody Earl of Douglas said to\r\nkeep the king\'s messenger in hand while he cut the head off MacLellan of\r\nBombie, at the Threave Castle, [The reader is referred for particulars\r\nto Pitscottie\'s HISTORY OF SCOTLAND.] and that put Steenie mair and mair\r\non his guard. So he spoke up like a man, and said he came neither to\r\neat, or drink or make minstrelsy; but simply for his ain--to ken what\r\nwas come o\' the money he had paid, and to get a discharge for it; and\r\nhe was so stout-hearted by this time that he charged Sir Robert for\r\nconscience-sake (he had no power to say the holy name) and as he hoped\r\nfor peace and rest, to spread no snares for him, but just to give him\r\nhis ain.\r\n\r\nThe appearance gnashed its teeth and laughed, but it took from a large\r\npocket-book the receipt, and handed it to Steenie. \'There is your\r\nreceipt, ye pitiful cur; and for the money, my dog-whelp of a son may go\r\nlook for it in the Cat\'s Cradle.\'\r\n\r\nMy gudesire uttered mony thanks, and was about to retire when Sir Robert\r\nroared aloud, \'Stop, though, thou sack-doudling son of a whore! I am not\r\ndone with thee. HERE we do nothing for nothing; and you must return on\r\nthis very day twelvemonth, to pay your master the homage that you owe me\r\nfor my protection.\'\r\n\r\nMy father\'s tongue was loosed of a suddenty, and he said aloud, \'I refer\r\nmysell to God\'s pleasure, and not to yours.\'\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner uttered the word than all was dark around him; and he\r\nsank on the earth with such a sudden shock, that he lost both breath and\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nHow lang Steenie lay there, he could not tell; but when he came to\r\nhimsell, he was lying in the auld kirkyard of Redgauntlet parochine just\r\nat the door of the family aisle, and the scutcheon of the auld knight,\r\nSir Robert, hanging over his head. There was a deep morning fog on grass\r\nand gravestane around him, and his horse was feeding quietly beside the\r\nminister\'s twa cows. Steenie would have thought the whole was a dream,\r\nbut he had the receipt in his hand, fairly written and signed by the\r\nauld laird; only the last letters of his name were a little disorderly,\r\nwritten like one seized with sudden pain.\r\n\r\nSorely troubled in his mind, he left that dreary place, rode through\r\nthe mist to Redgauntlet Castle, and with much ado he got speech of the\r\nlaird.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you dyvour bankrupt,\' was the first word, \'have you brought me my\r\nrent?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' answered my gudesire, \'I have not; but I have brought your honour\r\nSir Robert\'s receipt for it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wow, sirrah? Sir Robert\'s receipt! You told me he had not given you\r\none.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will your honour please to see if that bit line is right?\'\r\n\r\nSir John looked at every line, and at every letter, with much attention;\r\nand at last, at the date, which my gudesire had not observed,--\'FROM MY\r\nAPPOINTED PLACE,\' he read, \'THIS TWENTY-FIFTH OF NOVEMBER.\'--\'What!\r\nThat is yesterday!--Villain, thou must have gone to hell for this!\'\r\n\r\n\'I got it from your honour\'s father--whether he be in heaven or hell, I\r\nknow not,\' said Steenie.\r\n\r\n\'I will delate you for a warlock to the Privy Council!\' said Sir\r\nJohn. \'I will send you to your master, the devil, with the help of a\r\ntar-barrel and a torch!\'\r\n\r\n\'I intend to delate mysell to the Presbytery,\' said Steenie, \'and tell\r\nthem all I have seen last night, whilk are things fitter for them to\r\njudge of than a borrel man like me.\'\r\n\r\nSir John paused, composed himsell, and desired to hear the full history;\r\nand my gudesire told it him from point to point, as I have told it\r\nyou--word for word, neither more nor less.\r\n\r\nSir John was silent again for a long time, and at last he said, very\r\ncomposedly, \'Steenie, this story of yours concerns the honour of many\r\na noble family besides mine; and if it be a leasing-making, to keep\r\nyourself out of my danger, the least you can expect is to have a redhot\r\niron driven through your tongue, and that will be as bad as scauding\r\nyour fingers wi\' a redhot chanter. But yet it may be true, Steenie; and\r\nif the money cast up I shall not know what to think of it. But where\r\nshall we find the Cat\'s Cradle? There are cats enough about the old\r\nhouse, but I think they kitten without the ceremony of bed or cradle.\'\r\n\r\n\'We were best ask Hutcheon,\' said my gudesire; \'he kens a\' the odd\r\ncorners about as weel as--another serving-man that is now gane, and that\r\nI wad not like to name.\'\r\n\r\nAweel, Hutcheon, when he was asked, told them, that a ruinous turret,\r\nlang disused, next to the clock-house, only accessible by a ladder,\r\nfor the opening was on the outside, and far above the battlements, was\r\ncalled of old the Cat\'s Cradle.\r\n\r\n\'There will I go immediately,\' said Sir John; and he took (with what\r\npurpose, Heaven kens) one of his father\'s pistols from the hall-table,\r\nwhere they had lain since the night he died, and hastened to the\r\nbattlements.\r\n\r\nIt was a dangerous place to climb, for the ladder was auld and frail,\r\nand wanted ane or twa rounds. However, up got Sir John, and entered at\r\nthe turret-door, where his body stopped the only little light that was\r\nin the bit turret. Something flees at him wi\' a vengeance, maist dang\r\nhim back ower--bang gaed the knight\'s pistol, and Hutcheon, that\r\nheld the ladder, and my gudesire that stood beside him, hears a loud\r\nskelloch. A minute after, Sir John flings the body of the jackanape down\r\nto them, and cries that the siller is fund, and that they should come up\r\nand help him. And there was the bag of siller sure aneugh, and mony orra\r\nthing besides, that had been missing for mony a day. And Sir John, when\r\nhe had riped the turret weel, led my gudesire into the dining-parlour,\r\nand took him by the hand and spoke kindly to him, and said he was sorry\r\nhe should have doubted his word and that he would hereafter be a good\r\nmaster to him to make amends.\r\n\r\n\'And now, Steenie,\' said Sir John, \'although this vision of yours tend,\r\non the whole, to my father\'s credit, as an honest man, that he should,\r\neven after his death, desire to see justice done to a poor man like\r\nyou, yet you are sensible that ill-dispositioned men might make bad\r\nconstructions upon it, concerning his soul\'s health. So, I think, we had\r\nbetter lay the haill dirdum on that ill-deedie creature, Major Weir, and\r\nsay naething about your dream in the wood of Pitmurkie. You had taken\r\nower muckle brandy to be very certain about onything; and, Steenie, this\r\nreceipt\' (his hand shook while he held it out),--\'it\'s but a queer kind\r\nof document, and we will do best, I think, to put it quietly in the\r\nfire.\'\r\n\r\n\'Od, but for as queer as it is, it\'s a\' the voucher I have for my rent,\'\r\nsaid my gudesire, who was afraid, it may be, of losing the benefit of\r\nSir Robert\'s discharge.\r\n\r\n\'I will bear the contents to your credit in the rental-book, and give\r\nyou a discharge under my own hand,\' said Sir John, \'and that on the\r\nspot. And, Steenie, if you can hold your tongue about this matter, you\r\nshall sit, from this term downward, at an easier rent.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mony thanks to your honour,\' said Steenie, who saw easily in what\r\ncorner the wind was; \'doubtless I will be comformable to all your\r\nhonour\'s commands; only I would willingly speak wi\' some powerful\r\nminister on the subject, for I do not like the sort of sommons of\r\nappointment whilk your honour\'s father\'--\r\n\r\n\'Do not call the phantom my father!\' said Sir John, interrupting him.\r\n\r\n\'Weel, then, the thing that was so like him,\' said my gudesire; \'he\r\nspoke of my coming back to see him this time twelvemonth, and it\'s a\r\nweight on my conscience.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aweel, then,\' said Sir John, \'if you be so much distressed in mind, you\r\nmay speak to our minister of the parish; he is a douce man, regards the\r\nhonour of our family, and the mair that he may look for some patronage\r\nfrom me.\'\r\n\r\nWi\' that, my father readily agreed that the receipt should be burnt, and\r\nthe laird threw it into the chimney with his ain hand. Burn it would\r\nnot for them, though; but away it flew up the lum, wi\' a lang train of\r\nsparks at its tail, and a hissing noise like a squib.\r\n\r\nMy gudesire gaed down to the Manse, and the minister, when he had heard\r\nthe story, said it was his real opinion that though my gudesire had gaen\r\nvery far in tampering with dangerous matters, yet, as he had refused the\r\ndevil\'s arles (for such was the offer of meat and drink) and had refused\r\nto do homage by piping at his bidding, he hoped, that if he held a\r\ncircumspect walk hereafter, Satan could take little advantage by what\r\nwas come and gane. And, indeed, my gudesire, of his ain accord, lang\r\nforeswore baith the pipes and the brandy--it was not even till the\r\nyear was out, and the fatal day past, that he would so much as take the\r\nfiddle, or drink usquebaugh or tippeny.\r\n\r\nSir John made up his story about the jackanape as he liked himsell;\r\nand some believe till this day there was no more in the matter than the\r\nfilching nature of the brute. Indeed, ye\'ll no hinder some to threap\r\nthat it was nane o\' the auld Enemy that Dougal and my gudesire saw in\r\nthe laird\'s room, but only that wanchancy creature, the major, capering\r\non the coffin; and that, as to the blawing on the laird\'s whistle that\r\nwas heard after he was dead, the filthy brute could do that as weel as\r\nthe laird himsell, if no better. But Heaven kens the truth, whilk first\r\ncame out by the minister\'s wife, after Sir John and her ain gudeman were\r\nbaith in the moulds. And then my gudesire, wha was failed in his limbs,\r\nbut not in his judgement or memory--at least nothing to speak of--was\r\nobliged to tell the real narrative to his friends, for the credit of his\r\ngood name. He might else have been charged for a warlock. [See Note 3.]\r\n\r\nThe shades of evening were growing thicker around us as my conductor\r\nfinished his long narrative with this moral--\'Ye see, birkie, it is nae\r\nchancy thing to tak a stranger traveller for a guide, when you are in an\r\nuncouth land.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should not have made that inference,\' said I. \'Your grandfather\'s\r\nadventure was fortunate for himself, whom it saved from ruin and\r\ndistress; and fortunate for his landlord also, whom it prevented from\r\ncommitting a gross act of injustice.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, but they had baith to sup the sauce o\'t sooner or later,\' said\r\nWandering Willie--\'what was fristed wasna forgiven. Sir John died\r\nbefore he was much over three-score; and it was just like of a moment\'s\r\nillness. And for my gudesire, though he departed in fullness of life,\r\nyet there was my father, a yauld man of forty-five, fell down betwixt\r\nthe stilts of his pleugh, and rase never again, and left nae bairn but\r\nme, a puir sightless, fatherless, motherless creature, could neither\r\nwork nor want. Things gaed weel aneugh at first; for Sir Redwald\r\nRedgauntlet, the only son of Sir John, and the oye of auld Sir Robert,\r\nand, waes me! the last of the honourable house, took the farm aff our\r\nhands, and brought me into his household to have care of me. He liked\r\nmusic, and I had the best teachers baith England and Scotland could gie\r\nme. Mony a merry year was I wi\' him; but waes me! he gaed out with other\r\npretty men in the Forty-five--I\'ll say nae mair about it--My head never\r\nsettled weel since I lost him; and if I say another word about it, deil\r\na bar will I have the heart to play the night.--Look out, my gentle\r\nchap,\' he resumed in a different tone, \'ye should see the lights at\r\nBrokenburn glen by this time.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SAME TO THE SAME\r\n\r\n  Tam Luter was their minstrel meet,\r\n    Gude Lord as he could lance,\r\n  He play\'d sae shrill, and sang sae sweet,\r\n    Till Towsie took a trance.\r\n  Auld Lightfoot there he did forleet,\r\n    And counterfeited France;\r\n  He used himself as man discreet,\r\n    And up took Morrice danse sae loud,\r\n  At Christ\'s Kirk on the Green that day.\r\n                                     KING JAMES I.\r\n\r\nI continue to scribble at length, though the subject may seem somewhat\r\ndeficient in interest. Let the grace of the narrative, therefore,\r\nand the concern we take in each other\'s matters, make amends for its\r\ntenuity. We fools of fancy who suffer ourselves, like Malvolio, to be\r\ncheated with our own visions, have, nevertheless, this advantage over\r\nthe wise ones of the earth, that we have our whole stock of enjoyments\r\nunder our own command, and can dish for ourselves an intellectual\r\nbanquet with most moderate assistance from external objects. It is,\r\nto be sure, something like the feast which the Barmecide served up to\r\nAlnaschar; and we cannot expect to get fat upon such diet. But then,\r\nneither is there repletion nor nausea, which often succeed the grosser\r\nand more material revel. On the whole, I still pray, with the Ode to\r\nCastle Building--\r\n\r\n  Give me thy hope which sickens not the heart;\r\n    Give me thy wealth which has no wings to fly;\r\n  Give me the bliss thy visions can impart:\r\n    Thy friendship give me, warm in poverty!\r\n\r\nAnd so, despite thy solemn smile and sapient shake of the head, I will\r\ngo on picking such interest as I can out of my trivial adventures, even\r\nthough that interest should be the creation of my own fancy; nor will I\r\ncease to indict on thy devoted eyes the labour of perusing the scrolls\r\nin which I shall record my narrative.\r\n\r\nMy last broke off as we were on the point of descending into the glen\r\nat Brokenburn, by the dangerous track which I had first travelled EN\r\nCROUPE, behind a furious horseman, and was now again to brave under the\r\nprecarious guidance of a blind man.\r\n\r\nIt was now getting dark; but this was no inconvenience to my guide, who\r\nmoved on, as formerly, with instinctive security of step, so that we\r\nsoon reached the bottom, and I could see lights twinkling in the cottage\r\nwhich had been my place of refuge on a former occasion. It was not\r\nthither, however, that our course was directed. We left the habitation\r\nof the laird to the left, and turning down the brook, soon approached\r\nthe small hamlet which had been erected at the mouth of the stream,\r\nprobably on account of the convenience which it afforded as a harbour\r\nto the fishing-boats. A large, low cottage, full in our front, seemed\r\nhighly illuminated; for the light not only glanced from every window\r\nand aperture in its frail walls, but was even visible from rents and\r\nfractures in the roof, composed of tarred shingles, repaired in part by\r\nthatch and divot.\r\n\r\nWhile these appearances engaged my attention, that of my companion was\r\nattracted by a regular succession of sounds, like a bouncing on the\r\nfloor, mixed with a very faint noise of music, which Willie\'s acute\r\norgans at once recognized and accounted for, while to me it was almost\r\ninaudible. The old man struck the earth with his staff in a violent\r\npassion. \'The whoreson fisher rabble! They have brought another violer\r\nupon my walk! They are such smuggling blackguards, that they must run\r\nin their very music; but I\'ll sort them waur than ony gauger in the\r\ncountry.--Stay--hark--it \'s no a fiddle neither--it\'s the pipe and tabor\r\nbastard, Simon of Sowport, frae the Nicol Forest; but I\'ll pipe and\r\ntabor him!--Let me hae ance my left hand on his cravat, and ye shall see\r\nwhat my right will do. Come away, chap--come away, gentle chap--nae time\r\nto be picking and waling your steps.\' And on he passed with long and\r\ndetermined strides, dragging me along with him.\r\n\r\nI was not quite easy in his company; for, now that his minstrel pride\r\nwas hurt, the man had changed from the quiet, decorous, I might almost\r\nsay respectable person, which he seemed while he told his tale, into the\r\nappearance of a fierce, brawling, dissolute stroller. So that when he\r\nentered the large hut, where a great number of fishers, with their wives\r\nand daughters, were engaged in eating, drinking, and dancing, I was\r\nsomewhat afraid that the impatient violence of my companion might\r\nprocure us an indifferent reception.\r\n\r\nBut the universal shout of welcome with which Wandering Willie was\r\nreceived--the hearty congratulations--the repeated \'Here\'s t\' ye,\r\nWillie!\'--\'Where hae ya been, ye blind deevil?\' and the call upon him\r\nto pledge them--above all, the speed with which the obnoxious pipe and\r\ntabor were put to silence, gave the old man such effectual assurance of\r\nundiminished popularity and importance, as at once put his jealousy to\r\nrest, and changed his tone of offended dignity into one better fitted\r\nto receive such cordial greetings. Young men and women crowded round, to\r\ntell how much they were afraid some mischance had detained him, and how\r\ntwo or three young fellows had set out in quest of him.\r\n\r\n\'It was nae mischance, praised be Heaven,\' said Willie, \'but the absence\r\nof the lazy loon Rob the Rambler, my comrade, that didna come to meet\r\nme on the Links; but I hae gotten a braw consort in his stead, worth a\r\ndozen of him, the unhanged blackguard.\'\r\n\r\n\'And wha is\'t tou\'s gotten, Wullie, lad?\' said half a score of voices,\r\nwhile all eyes were turned on your humble servant, who kept the best\r\ncountenance he could, though not quite easy at becoming the centre to\r\nwhich all eyes were pointed.\r\n\r\n\'I ken him by his hemmed cravat,\' said one fellow; \'it\'s Gil Hobson, the\r\nsouple tailor frae Burgh. Ye are welcome to Scotland, ye prick-the-clout\r\nloon,\' he said, thrusting forth a paw; much the colour of a badger\'s\r\nback, and of most portentous dimensions.\r\n\r\n\'Gil Hobson? Gil whoreson!\' exclaimed Wandering Willie; \'it\'s a gentle\r\nchap that I judge to be an apprentice wi\' auld Joshua Geddes, to the\r\nquaker-trade.\'\r\n\r\n\'What trade be\'s that, man?\' said he of the badger-coloured fist.\r\n\r\n\'Canting and lying,\'--said Willie, which produced a thundering laugh;\r\n\'but I am teaching the callant a better trade, and that is, feasting and\r\nfiddling.\'\r\n\r\nWillie\'s conduct in thus announcing something like my real character,\r\nwas contrary to compact; and yet I was rather glad he did so, for the\r\nconsequence of putting a trick upon these rude and ferocious men, might,\r\nin case of discovery, have been dangerous to us both, and I was at the\r\nsame time delivered from the painful effort to support a fictitious\r\ncharacter. The good company, except perhaps one or two of the young\r\nwomen whose looks expressed some desire for better acquaintance, gave\r\nthemselves no further trouble about me; but, while the seniors resumed\r\ntheir places near an immense bowl or rather reeking cauldron of\r\nbrandy-punch, the younger arranged themselves on the floor and called\r\nloudly on Willie to strike up.\r\n\r\nWith a brief caution to me, to \'mind my credit, for fishers have ears,\r\nthough fish have none,\' Willie led off in capital style, and I followed,\r\ncertainly not so as to disgrace my companion, who, every now and then,\r\ngave me a nod of approbation. The dances were, of course, the Scottish\r\njigs, and reels, and \'twasome dances\', with a strathspey or hornpipe for\r\ninterlude; and the want of grace on the part of the performers was amply\r\nsupplied by truth of ear, vigour and decision of step, and the agility\r\nproper to the northern performers. My own spirits rose with the mirth\r\naround me, and with old Willie\'s admirable execution, and frequent \'weel\r\ndune, gentle chap, yet;\'--and, to confess the truth, I felt a great deal\r\nmore pleasure in this rustic revel, than I have done at the more formal\r\nballs and concerts in your famed city, to which I have sometimes made my\r\nway. Perhaps this was because I was a person of more importance to the\r\npresiding matron of Brokenburn-foot, than I had the means of rendering\r\nmyself to the far-famed Miss Nickie Murray, the patroness of your\r\nEdinburgh assemblies. The person I mean was a buxom dame of about\r\nthirty, her fingers loaded with many a silver ring, and three or four\r\nof gold; her ankles liberally displayed from under her numerous blue,\r\nwhite, and scarlet; short petticoats, and attired in hose of the finest\r\nand whitest lamb\'s-wool, which arose from shoes of Spanish cordwain,\r\nfastened with silver buckles. She took the lead in my favour, and\r\ndeclared, \'that the brave young gentleman should not weary himself to\r\ndeath wi\' playing, but take the floor for a dance or twa.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what\'s to come of me, Dame Martin?\' said Willie.\r\n\r\n\'Come o\' thee?\' said the dame; \'mishanter on the auld beard o\' ye! ye\r\ncould play for twenty hours on end, and tire out the haill countryside\r\nwi\' dancing before ye laid down your bow, saving for a by-drink or the\r\nlike o\' that.\'\r\n\r\n\'In troth, dame,\' answered Willie, \'ye are no sae far wrang; sae if my\r\ncomrade is to take his dance, ye maun gie me my drink, and then bob it\r\naway like Madge of Middlebie.\'\r\n\r\nThe drink was soon brought; but while Willie was partaking of it,\r\na party entered the hut, which arrested my attention at once, and\r\nintercepted the intended gallantry with which I had proposed to present\r\nmy hand to the fresh-coloured, well-made, white-ankled Thetis, who had\r\nobtained me manumission from my musical task.\r\n\r\nThis was nothing less than the sudden appearance of the old woman whom\r\nthe laird had termed Mabel; Cristal Nixon, his male attendant; and the\r\nyoung person who had said grace to us when I supped with him.\r\n\r\nThis young person--Alan, thou art in thy way a bit of a conjurer--this\r\nyoung person whom I DID NOT describe, and whom you, for that very\r\nreason, suspected was not an indifferent object to me--is, I am sorry to\r\nsay it, in very fact not so much so as in prudence she ought. I will not\r\nuse the name of love on this occasion; for I have applied it too often\r\nto transient whims and fancies to escape your satire, should I venture\r\nto apply it now. For it is a phrase, I must confess, which I have\r\nused--a romancer would say, profaned--a little too often, considering\r\nhow few years have passed over my head. But seriously, the fair chaplain\r\nof Brokenburn has been often in my head when she had no business\r\nthere; and if this can give thee any clue for explaining my motives\r\nin lingering about the country, and assuming the character of Willie\'s\r\ncompanion, why, hang thee, thou art welcome to make use of it--a\r\npermission for which thou need\'st not thank me much, as thou wouldst not\r\nhave failed to assume it whether it were given or no.\r\n\r\nSuch being my feelings, conceive how they must have been excited, when,\r\nlike a beam upon a cloud, I saw this uncommonly beautiful girl enter the\r\napartment in which they were dancing; not, however, with the air of\r\nan equal, but that of a superior, come to grace with her presence the\r\nfestival of her dependants. The old man and woman attended, with looks\r\nas sinister as hers were lovely, like two of the worst winter months\r\nwaiting upon the bright-eyed May.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered--wonder if thou wilt--she wore A GREEN MANTLE, such as\r\nthou hast described as the garb of thy fair client, and confirmed what\r\nI had partly guessed from thy personal description, that my chaplain and\r\nthy visitor were the same person. There was an alteration on her\r\nbrow the instant she recognized me. She gave her cloak to her female\r\nattendant, and, after a momentary hesitation, as if uncertain whether to\r\nadvance or retire, she walked into the room with dignity and\r\ncomposure, all making way, the men unbonneting, and the women curtsying\r\nrespectfully, as she assumed a chair which was reverently placed for her\r\naccommodation, apart from others.\r\n\r\nThere was then a pause, until the bustling mistress of the ceremonies,\r\nwith awkward but kindly courtesy, offered the young lady a glass of\r\nwine, which was at first declined, and at length only thus far accepted,\r\nthat, bowing round to the festive company, the fair visitor wished them\r\nall health and mirth, and just touching the brim with her lip, replaced\r\nit on the salver. There was another pause; and I did not immediately\r\nrecollect, confused as I was by this unexpected apparition, that it\r\nbelonged to me to break it. At length a murmur was heard around me,\r\nbeing expected to exhibit,--nay, to lead down the dance,--in consequence\r\nof the previous conversation.\r\n\r\n\'Deil\'s in the fiddler lad,\' was muttered from more quarters than\r\none--\'saw folk ever sic a thing as a shame-faced fiddler before?\'\r\n\r\nAt length a venerable Triton, seconding his remonstrances with a hearty\r\nthump on my shoulder, cried out, \'To the floor--to the floor, and let us\r\nsee how ye can fling--the lasses are a\' waiting.\'\r\n\r\nUp I jumped, sprang from the elevated station which constituted our\r\norchestra, and, arranging my ideas as rapidly as I could, advanced\r\nto the head of the room, and, instead of offering my hand to the\r\nwhite-footed Thetis aforesaid, I venturously made the same proposal to\r\nher of the Green Mantle.\r\n\r\nThe nymph\'s lovely eyes seemed to open with astonishment at the\r\naudacity of this offer; and, from the murmurs I heard around me, I also\r\nunderstood that it surprised, and perhaps offended, the bystanders. But\r\nafter the first moment\'s emotion, she wreathed her neck, and drawing\r\nherself haughtily up, like one who was willing to show that she was\r\nsensible of the full extent of her own condescension, extended her hand\r\ntowards me, like a princess gracing a squire of low degree.\r\n\r\nThere is affectation in all this, thought I to myself, if the Green\r\nMantle has borne true evidence--for young ladies do not make visits, or\r\nwrite letters to counsel learned in the law, to interfere in the motions\r\nof those whom they hold as cheap as this nymph seems to do me; and if\r\nI am cheated by a resemblance of cloaks, still I am interested to show\r\nmyself, in some degree, worthy of the favour she has granted with so\r\nmuch state and reserve. The dance to be performed was the old Scots Jig,\r\nin which you are aware I used to play no sorry figure at La Pique\'s,\r\nwhen thy clumsy movements used to be rebuked by raps over the knuckles\r\nwith that great professor\'s fiddlestick. The choice of the tune was left\r\nto my comrade Willie, who, having finished his drink, feloniously struck\r\nup the well-known and popular measure,\r\n\r\n  Merrily danced the Quaker\'s wife,\r\n  And merrily danced the Quaker.\r\n\r\nAn astounding laugh arose at my expense, and I should have been\r\nannihilated, but that the smile which mantled on the lip of my partner,\r\nhad a different expression from that of ridicule, and seemed to say,\r\n\'Do not take this to heart.\' And I did not, Alan--my partner danced\r\nadmirably, and I like one who was determined, if outshone, which I could\r\nnot help, not to be altogether thrown into the shade.\r\n\r\nI assure you our performance, as well as Willie\'s music, deserved\r\nmore polished spectators and auditors; but we could not then have been\r\ngreeted with such enthusiastic shouts of applause as attended while I\r\nhanded my partner to her seat, and took my place by her side, as one who\r\nhad a right to offer the attentions usual on such an occasion. She was\r\nvisibly embarrassed, but I was determined not to observe her confusion,\r\nand to avail myself of the opportunity of learning whether this\r\nbeautiful creature\'s mind was worthy of the casket in which nature had\r\nlodged it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, however courageously I formed this resolution, you cannot\r\nbut too well guess the difficulties I must needs have felt in carrying\r\nit into execution; since want of habitual intercourse with the charmers\r\nof the other sex has rendered me a sheepish cur, only one grain less\r\nawkward than thyself. Then she was so very beautiful, and assumed an\r\nair of so much dignity, that I was like to fall under the fatal error of\r\nsupposing she should only be addressed with something very clever; and\r\nin the hasty raking which my brains underwent in this persuasion, not a\r\nsingle idea occurred that common sense did not reject as fustian on the\r\none hand, or weary, flat, and stale triticism on the other. I felt as\r\nif my understanding were no longer my own, but was alternately under the\r\ndominion of Aldeborontiphoscophornio, and that of his facetious friend\r\nRigdum-Funnidos. How did I envy at that moment our friend Jack Oliver,\r\nwho produces with such happy complacence his fardel of small talk, and\r\nwho, as he never doubts his own powers of affording amusement, passes\r\nthem current with every pretty woman he approaches, and fills up the\r\nintervals of chat by his complete acquaintance with the exercise of the\r\nfan, the FLACON, and the other duties of the CAVALIERE SERVENTE. Some\r\nof these I attempted, but I suppose it was awkwardly; at least the Lady\r\nGreen Mantle received them as a princess accepts the homage of a clown.\r\n\r\nMeantime the floor remained empty, and as the mirth of the good meeting\r\nwas somewhat checked, I ventured, as a DERNIER RESSORT, to propose a\r\nminuet. She thanked me, and told me haughtily enough, \'she was here\r\nto encourage the harmless pleasures of these good folks, but was not\r\ndisposed to make an exhibition of her own indifferent dancing for their\r\namusement.\'\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, as if she expected me to suggest something; and as\r\nI remained silent and rebuked, she bowed her head more graciously, and\r\nsaid, \'Not to affront you, however, a country-dance, if you please.\'\r\n\r\nWhat an ass was I, Alan, not to have anticipated her wishes! Should I\r\nnot have observed that the ill-favoured couple, Mabel and Cristal, had\r\nplaced themselves on each side of her seat, like the supporters of the\r\nroyal arms? the man, thick, short, shaggy, and hirsute, as the lion; the\r\nfemale, skin-dried, tight-laced, long, lean, and hungry-faced, like the\r\nunicorn. I ought to have recollected, that under the close inspection\r\nof two such watchful salvages, our communication, while in repose, could\r\nnot have been easy; that the period of dancing a minuet was not the very\r\nchoicest time for conversation; but that the noise, the exercise,\r\nand the mazy confusion of a country-dance, where the inexperienced\r\nperformers were every now and then running against each other, and\r\ncompelling the other couples to stand still for a minute at a time,\r\nbesides the more regular repose afforded by the intervals of the dance\r\nitself, gave the best possible openings for a word or two spoken in\r\nseason, and without being liable to observation.\r\n\r\nWe had but just led down, when an opportunity of the kind occurred, and\r\nmy partner said, with great gentleness and modesty, \'It is not perhaps\r\nvery proper in me to acknowledge an acquaintance that is not claimed;\r\nbut I believe I speak to Mr. Darsie Latimer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Darsie Latimer was indeed the person that had now the honour and\r\nhappiness\'--\r\n\r\nI would have gone on in the false gallop of compliment, but she cut me\r\nshort. \'And why,\' she said, \'is Mr. Latimer here, and in disguise, or at\r\nleast assuming an office unworthy of a man of education?--I beg pardon,\'\r\nshe continued,--\'I would not give you pain, but surely making, an\r\nassociate of a person of that description\'--\r\n\r\nShe looked towards my friend Willie, and was silent. I felt heartily\r\nashamed of myself, and hastened to say it was an idle frolic, which want\r\nof occupation had suggested, and which I could not regret, since it had\r\nprocured me the pleasure I at present enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWithout seeming to notice my compliment, she took the next opportunity\r\nto say, \'Will Mr. Latimer permit a stranger who wishes him well to ask,\r\nwhether it is right that, at his active age, he should be in so far void\r\nof occupation, as to be ready to adopt low society for the sake of idle\r\namusement?\'\r\n\r\n\'You are severe, madam,\' I answered; \'but I cannot think myself degraded\r\nby mixing with any society where I meet\'--\r\n\r\nHere I stopped short, conscious that I was giving my answer an\r\nunhandsome turn. The ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM, the last to which a polite\r\nman has recourse, may, however, be justified by circumstances, but\r\nseldom or never the ARGUMENTUM AD FOEMINAM.\r\n\r\nShe filled up the blank herself which I had left. \'Where you meet ME, I\r\nsuppose you would say? But the case is different. I am, from my unhappy\r\nfate, obliged to move by the will of others, and to be in places which\r\nI would by my own will gladly avoid. Besides, I am, except for these few\r\nminutes, no participator of the revels--a spectator only, and attended\r\nby my servants. Your situation is different--you are here by choice,\r\nthe partaker and minister of the pleasures of a class below you in\r\neducation, birth, and fortunes. If I speak harshly, Mr. Latimer,\' she\r\nadded, with much sweetness of manner, \'I mean kindly.\'\r\n\r\nI was confounded by her speech, \'severe in youthful wisdom\'; all\r\nof naive or lively, suitable to such a dialogue, vanished from my\r\nrecollection, and I answered with gravity like her own, \'I am, indeed,\r\nbetter educated than these poor people; but you, madam, whose kind\r\nadmonition I am grateful for, must know more of my condition than I\r\ndo myself--I dare not say I am their superior in birth, since I know\r\nnothing of my own, or in fortunes, over which hangs an impenetrable\r\ncloud.\'\r\n\r\n\'And why should your ignorance on these points drive you into low\r\nsociety and idle habits?\' answered my female monitor. \'Is it manly to\r\nwait till fortune cast her beams upon you, when by exertion of your own\r\nenergy you might distinguish yourself? Do not the pursuits of learning\r\nlie open to you--of manly ambition--of war? But no--not of war, that has\r\nalready cost you too dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will be what you wish me to be,\' I replied with eagerness--\'You have\r\nbut to choose my path, and you shall see if I do not pursue it with\r\nenergy, were it only because you command me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not because I command you,\' said the maiden, \'but because reason,\r\ncommon sense, manhood, and, in one word, regard for your own safety,\r\ngive the same counsel.\'\r\n\r\n\'At least permit me to reply, that reason and sense never assumed\r\na fairer form--of persuasion,\' I hastily added; for she turned from\r\nme--nor did she give me another opportunity of continuing what I had\r\nto say till the next pause of the dance, when, determined to bring our\r\ndialogue to a point, I said, \'You mentioned manhood also, and in the\r\nsame breath, personal danger. My ideas of manhood suggest that it is\r\ncowardice to retreat before dangers of a doubtful character. You, who\r\nappear to know so much of my fortunes that I might call you my guardian\r\nangel, tell me what these dangers are, that I may judge whether manhood\r\ncalls on me to face or to fly them.\'\r\n\r\nShe was evidently perplexed by this appeal.\r\n\r\n\'You make me pay dearly for acting as your humane adviser,\' she replied\r\nat last: \'I acknowledge an interest in your fate, and yet I dare not\r\ntell you whence it arises; neither am I at liberty to say why, or from\r\nwhom, you are in danger; but it is not less true that danger is near\r\nand imminent. Ask me no more, but, for your own sake, begone from this\r\ncountry. Elsewhere you are safe--here you do but invite your fate.\'\r\n\r\n\'But am I doomed to bid thus farewell to almost the only human being who\r\nhas showed an interest in my welfare? Do not say so--say that we shall\r\nmeet again, and the hope shall be the leading star to regulate my\r\ncourse!\'\r\n\r\n\'It is more than probable,\' she said--\'much more than probable, that we\r\nmay never meet again. The help which I now render you is all that may be\r\nin my power; it is such as I should render to a blind man whom I might\r\nobserve approaching the verge of a precipice; it ought to excite no\r\nsurprise, and requires no gratitude.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, she again turned from me, nor did she address me until the\r\ndance was on the point of ending, when she said, \'Do not attempt to\r\nspeak to or approach me again in the course of the night; leave the\r\ncompany as soon as you can, but not abruptly, and God be with you.\'\r\n\r\nI handed her to her seat, and did not quit the fair palm I held, without\r\nexpressing my feelings by a gentle pressure. She coloured slightly, and\r\nwithdrew her hand, but not angrily. Seeing the eyes of Cristal and Mabel\r\nsternly fixed on me, I bowed deeply, and withdrew from her; my heart\r\nsaddening, and my eyes becoming dim in spite of me, as the shifting\r\ncrowd hid us from each other.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to have crept back to my comrade Willie, and resumed\r\nmy bow with such spirit as I might, although, at the moment, I would\r\nhave given half my income for an instant\'s solitude. But my retreat was\r\ncut off by Dame Martin, with the frankness--if it is not an inconsistent\r\nphrase-of rustic coquetry, that goes straight up to the point.\r\n\r\n\'Aye, lad, ye seem unco sune weary, to dance sae lightly? Better the nag\r\nthat ambles a\' the day, than him that makes a brattle for a mile, and\r\nthen\'s dune wi\' the road.\'\r\n\r\nThis was a fair challenge, and I could not decline accepting it.\r\nBesides, I could see Dame Martin was queen of the revels; and so many\r\nwere the rude and singular figures about me, that I was by no means\r\ncertain whether I might not need some protection. I seized on her\r\nwilling hand, and we took our places in the dance, where, if I did not\r\nacquit myself with all the accuracy of step and movement which I had\r\nbefore attempted, I at least came up to the expectations of my partner,\r\nwho said, and almost swore, \'I was prime at it;\' while, stimulated\r\nto her utmost exertions, she herself frisked like a kid, snapped her\r\nfingers like castanets, whooped like a Bacchanal, and bounded from the\r\nfloor like a tennis-ball,--aye, till the colour of her garters was no\r\nparticular mystery. She made the less secret of this, perhaps, that they\r\nwere sky-blue, and fringed with silver.\r\n\r\nThe time has been that this would have been special fun; or rather, last\r\nnight was the only time I can recollect these four years when it would\r\nnot have been so; yet, at this moment, I cannot tell you how I longed\r\nto be rid of Dame Martin. I almost wished she would sprain one of those\r\n\'many-twinkling\' ankles, which served her so alertly; and when, in the\r\nmidst of her exuberant caprioling, I saw my former partner leaving\r\nthe apartment, and with eyes, as I thought, turning towards me, this\r\nunwillingness to carry on the dance increased to such a point, that I\r\nwas almost about to feign a sprain or a dislocation myself, in order to\r\nput an end to the performance. But there were around me scores of old\r\nwomen, all of whom looked as if they might have some sovereign recipe\r\nfor such an accident; and, remembering Gil Blas, and his pretended\r\ndisorder in the robber\'s cavern, I thought it as wise to play Dame\r\nMartin fair, and dance till she thought proper to dismiss me. What I did\r\nI resolved to do strenuously, and in the latter part of the exhibition\r\nI cut and sprang from the floor as high and as perpendicularly as Dame\r\nMartin herself; and received, I promise you, thunders of applause, for\r\nthe common people always prefer exertion and agility to grace. At length\r\nDame Martin could dance no more, and, rejoicing at my release, I led her\r\nto a seat, and took the privilege of a partner to attend her.\r\n\r\n\'Hegh, sirs,\' exclaimed Dame Martin, \'I am sair forfoughen! Troth!\r\ncallant, I think ye hae been amaist the death o\' me.\'\r\n\r\nI could only atone for the alleged offence by fetching her some\r\nrefreshment, of which she readily partook.\r\n\r\n\'I have been lucky in my partners,\' I said, \'first that pretty young\r\nlady, and then you, Mrs. Martin.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hout wi\' your fleeching,\' said Dame Martin. \'Gae wa--gae wa, lad; dinna\r\nblaw in folk\'s lugs that gate; me and Miss Lilias even\'d thegither! Na,\r\nna, lad--od, she is maybe four or five years younger than the like o\'\r\nme,--bye and attour her gentle havings.\'\r\n\r\n\'She is the laird\'s daughter?\' said I, in as careless a tone of inquiry\r\nas I could assume.\r\n\r\n\'His daughter, man? Na, na, only his niece--and sib aneugh to him, I\r\nthink.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, indeed,\' I replied; \'I thought she had borne his name?\'\r\n\r\n\'She bears her ain name, and that\'s Lilias.\'\r\n\r\n\'And has she no other name?\' asked I.\r\n\r\n\'What needs she another till she gets a gudeman?\' answered my Thetis,\r\na little miffed perhaps--to use the women\'s phrase--that I turned\r\nthe conversation upon my former partner, rather than addressed it to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause, which was interrupted by Dame Martin\r\nobserving, \'They are standing up again.\'\r\n\r\n\'True,\' said I, having no mind to renew my late violent CAPRIOLE, and I\r\nmust go help old Willie.\'\r\n\r\nEre I could extricate myself, I heard poor Thetis address herself to\r\na sort of merman in a jacket of seaman\'s blue, and a pair of trousers\r\n(whose hand, by the way, she had rejected at an earlier part of the\r\nevening) and intimate that she was now disposed to take a trip.\r\n\r\n\'Trip away, then, dearie,\' said the vindictive man of the waters,\r\nwithout offering his hand; \'there,\' pointing to the floor, \'is a roomy\r\nberth for you.\'\r\n\r\nCertain I had made one enemy, and perhaps two, I hastened to my original\r\nseat beside Willie, and began to handle my bow. But I could see that my\r\nconduct had made an unfavourable impression; the words, \'flory conceited\r\nchap,\'--\'hafflins gentle,\' and at length, the still more alarming\r\nepithet of \'spy,\' began to be buzzed about, and I was heartily glad when\r\nthe apparition of Sam\'s visage at the door, who was already possessed of\r\nand draining a can of punch, gave me assurance that my means of retreat\r\nwere at hand. I intimated as much to Willie, who probably had heard\r\nmore of the murmurs of the company than I had, for he whispered, \'Aye,\r\naye,--awa wi\' ye--ower lang here--slide out canny--dinna let them see ye\r\nare on the tramp.\'\r\n\r\nI slipped half a guinea into the old man\'s hand, who answered, \'Truts\r\npruts! nonsense but I \'se no refuse, trusting ye can afford it. Awa wi\'\r\nye--and if ony body stops ye, cry on me.\'\r\n\r\nI glided, by his advice, along the room as if looking for a partner,\r\njoined Sam, whom I disengaged with some difficulty from his can, and\r\nwe left the cottage together in a manner to attract the least possible\r\nobservation. The horses were tied in a neighbouring shed, and as\r\nthe moon was up, and I was now familiar with the road, broken and\r\ncomplicated as it is, we soon reached the Shepherd\'s Bush, where the old\r\nlandlady was sitting up waiting for us, under some anxiety of mind, to\r\naccount for which she did not hesitate to tell me that some folks had\r\ngone to Brokenburn from her house, or neighbouring towns, that did not\r\ncome so safe back again. \'Wandering Willie,\' she said, \'was doubtless a\r\nkind of protection.\'\r\n\r\nHere Willie\'s wife, who was smoking in the chimney corner, took up the\r\npraises of her \'hinnie,\' as she called him, and endeavoured to awaken\r\nmy generosity afresh, by describing the dangers from which, as she was\r\npleased to allege, her husband\'s countenance had assuredly been the\r\nmeans of preserving me. I was not, however, to be fooled out of\r\nmore money at this time, and went to bed in haste, full of vanous\r\ncogitations.\r\n\r\nI have since spent a couple of days betwixt Mount Sharon and this place,\r\nand betwixt reading, writing to thee this momentous history, forming\r\nplans for seeing the lovely Lilias, and--partly, I think, for the sake\r\nof contradiction--angling a little in spite of Joshua\'a scruples--though\r\nI am rather liking the amusement better as I begin to have some success\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my dearest Alan, you are in full possession of my secret--let\r\nme as frankly into the recesses of your bosom. How do you feel towards\r\nthis fair ignis fatuus, this lily of the desert? Tell me honestly; for\r\nhowever the recollection of her may haunt my own mind, my love for Alan\r\nFairford surpasses the love of woman, I know, too, that when you DO\r\nlove, it will be to\r\n\r\n  Love once and love no more.\r\n\r\nA deep-consuming passion, once kindled in a breast so steady as yours,\r\nwould never be extinguished but with life. I am of another and more\r\nvolatile temper, and though I shall open your next with a trembling hand\r\nand uncertain heart, yet let it bring a frank confession that this fair\r\nunknown has made a deeper impression on your gravity than you reckoned\r\nfor, and you will see I can tear the arrow from my own wound, barb and\r\nall. In the meantime, though I have formed schemes once more to see her,\r\nI will, you may rely on it, take no step for putting them into practice.\r\nI have refrained from this hitherto, and I give you my word of honour,\r\nI shall continue to do so; yet why should you need any further assurance\r\nfrom one who is so entirely yours as D.L.\r\n\r\nPS.--I shall be on thorns till I receive your answer. I read, and\r\nre-read your letter, and cannot for my soul discover what your real\r\nsentiments are. Sometimes I think you write of her as one in jest--and\r\nsometimes I think that cannot be. Put me at ease as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII\r\n\r\nALAN FAIRFORD TO DARSIE LATIMER\r\n\r\nI write on the instant, as you direct; and in a tragi-comic humour, for\r\nI have a tear in my eye and a smile on my cheek. Dearest Darsie, sure\r\nnever a being but yourself could be so generous--sure never a being but\r\nyourself could be so absurd! I remember when you were a boy you wished\r\nto make your fine new whip a present to old Aunt Peggy, merely because\r\nshe admired it; and now, with like unreflecting and inappropriate\r\nliberality, you would resign your beloved to a smoke-dried young\r\nsophister, who cares not one of the hairs which it is his occupation to\r\nsplit, for all the daughters of Eve. I in love with your Lilias--your\r\nGreen Mantle--your unknown enchantress!--why I scarce saw her for five\r\nminutes, and even then only the tip of her chin was distinctly visible.\r\nShe was well made, and the tip of her chin was of a most promising cast\r\nfor the rest of the face; but, Heaven save you! she came upon business!\r\nand for a lawyer to fall in love with a pretty client on a single\r\nconsultation, would be as wise as if he became enamoured of a\r\nparticularly bright sunbeam which chanced for a moment to gild his\r\nbar-wig. I give you my word I am heart-whole and moreover, I assure you,\r\nthat before I suffer a woman to sit near my heart\'s core, I must see her\r\nfull face, without mask or mantle, aye, and know a good deal of her\r\nmind into the bargain. So never fret yourself on my account, my kind and\r\ngenerous Darsie; but, for your own sake, have a care and let not an idle\r\nattachment, so lightly taken up, lead you into serious danger.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I feel so apprehensive, that now when I am decorated\r\nwith the honours of the gown, I should have abandoned my career at the\r\nvery starting to come to you, but for my father having contrived to\r\nclog my heels with fetters of a professional nature. I will tell you the\r\nmatter at length, for it is comical enough; and why should not you\r\nlist to my juridical adventures, as well as I to those of your fiddling\r\nknight-errantry?\r\n\r\nIt was after dinner, and I was considering how I might best introduce\r\nto my father the private resolution I had formed to set off for\r\nDumfriesshire, or whether I had not better run away at once, and plead\r\nmy excuse by letter, when, assuming the peculiar look with which he\r\ncommunicates any of his intentions respecting me, that he suspects may\r\nnot be altogether acceptable, \'Alan,\' he said, \'ye now wear a gown--ye\r\nhave opened shop, as we would say of a more mechanical profession; and,\r\ndoubtless, ye think the floor of the courts is strewed with guineas, and\r\nthat ye have only to stoop down to gather them?\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope I am sensible, sir,\' I replied, \'that I have some knowledge and\r\npractice to acquire, and must stoop for that in the first place.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is well said,\' answered my father; and, always afraid to give too\r\nmuch encouragement, added, \'Very well said, if it be well acted up\r\nto--Stoop to get knowledge and practice is the very word. Ye know very\r\nwell, Alan, that in the other faculty who study the ARS MEDENDI, before\r\nthe young doctor gets to the bedsides of palaces, he must, as they call\r\nit, walk the hospitals; and cure Lazarus of his sores, before he be\r\nadmitted to prescribe for Dives, when he has gout or indigestion\'--\r\n\r\n\'I am aware, sir, that\'--\r\n\r\n\'Whisht--do not interrupt the court. Well--also the chirurgeons have\r\na useful practice, by which they put their apprentices and tyrones to\r\nwork; upon senseless dead bodies, to which, as they can do no good, so\r\nthey certainly can do as little harm; while at the same time the tyro,\r\nor apprentice, gains experience, and becomes fit to whip off a leg or\r\narm from a living subject, as cleanly as ye would slice an onion.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe I guess your meaning, sir,\' answered I; \'and were it not for\r\na very particular engagement\'--\r\n\r\n\'Do not speak to me of engagements; but whisht--there is a good lad--and\r\ndo not interrupt the court.\'\r\n\r\nMy father, you know, is apt--be it said with all filial duty--to be a\r\nlittle prolix in his harangues. I had nothing for it but to lean back\r\nand listen.\r\n\r\n\'Maybe you think, Alan, because I have, doubtless, the management of\r\nsome actions in dependence, whilk my worthy clients have intrusted\r\nme with, that I may think of airting them your way INSTANTER; and so\r\nsetting you up in practice, so far as my small business or influence may\r\ngo; and, doubtless, Alan, that is a day whilk I hope may come round. But\r\nthen, before I give, as the proverb hath it, "My own fish-guts to my own\r\nsea-maws," I must, for the sake of my own character, be very sure that\r\nmy sea-maw can pick them to some purpose. What say ye?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am so far,\' answered I, \'from wishing to get early into practice,\r\nsir, that I would willingly bestow a few days\'--\r\n\r\n\'In further study, ye would say, Alan. But that is not the way\r\neither--ye must walk the hospitals--ye must cure Lazarus--ye must cut\r\nand carve on a departed subject, to show your skill.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure,\' I replied, \'I will undertake the cause of any poor man with\r\npleasure, and bestow as much pains upon it as if it were a duke\'s; but\r\nfor the next two or three days\'--\r\n\r\n\'They must be devoted to close study, Alan--very close study indeed; for\r\nye must stand primed for a hearing, IN PRESENTIA DOMINORUM, upon Tuesday\r\nnext.\'\r\n\r\n\'I, sir?\' I replied in astonishment--\'I have not opened my mouth in the\r\nOuter House yet!\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind the court of the Gentiles, man,\' said my father; \'we will\r\nhave you into the Sanctuary at once--over shoes, over boots.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, sir, I should really spoil any cause thrust on me so hastily.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ye cannot spoil it, Alan,\' said my father, rubbing his hands with much\r\ncomplacency; \'that is the very cream of the business, man--it is just,\r\nas I said before, a subject upon whilk all the TYRONES have been trying\r\ntheir whittles for fifteen years; and as there have been about ten or a\r\ndozen agents concerned, and each took his own way, the case is come to\r\nthat pass, that Stair or Amiston could not mend it; and I do not think\r\neven you, Alan, can do it much harm--ye may get credit by it, but ye can\r\nlose none.\'\r\n\r\n\'And pray what is the name of my happy client, sir?\' said I,\r\nungraciously enough, I believe.\r\n\r\n\'It is a well-known name in the Parliament House,\' replied my father.\r\n\'To say the truth, I expect him every moment; it is Peter Peebles.\' [See\r\nNote 4.]\r\n\r\n\'Peter Peebles!\' exclaimed I, in astonishment; \'he is an insane\r\nbeggar--as poor as Job, and as mad as a March hare!\'\r\n\r\n\'He has been pleaing in the court for fifteen years,\' said my father, in\r\na tone of commiseration, which seemed to acknowledge that this fact\r\nwas enough to account for the poor man\'s condition both in mind and\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\'Besides, sir,\' I added, \'he is on the Poor\'s Roll; and you know there\r\nare advocates regularly appointed to manage those cases; and for me to\r\npresume to interfere\'--\r\n\r\n\'Whisht, Alan!--never interrupt the court--all THAT is managed for ye\r\nlike a tee\'d ball\' (my father sometimes draws his similes from his once\r\nfavourite game of golf); \'you must know, Alan, that Peter\'s cause was\r\nto have been opened by young Dumtoustie--ye may ken the lad, a son of\r\nDumtoustie of that ilk, member of Parliament for the county of--, and a\r\nnephew of the laird\'s younger brother, worthy Lord Bladderskate, whilk\r\nye are aware sounds as like being akin to a peatship [Formerly, a\r\nlawyer, supposed to be under the peculiar patronage of any particular\r\njudge, was invidiously termed his PEAT or PET.] and a sheriffdom, as a\r\nsieve is sib to a riddle. Now, Peter Drudgeit, my lord\'s clerk, came to\r\nme this morning in the House, like ane bereft of his wits; for it seems\r\nthat young Dumtoustie is ane of the Poor\'s lawyers, and Peter Peebles\'s\r\nprocess had been remitted to him of course. But so soon as the\r\nharebrained goose saw the pokes [Process-bags.] (as indeed, Alan, they\r\nare none of the least) he took fright, called for his nag, lap on, and\r\naway to the country is he gone; and so? said Peter, my lord is at his\r\nwit\'s end wi\' vexation, and shame, to see his nevoy break off the course\r\nat the very starting. "I\'ll tell you, Peter," said I, "were I my lord,\r\nand a friend or kinsman of mine should leave the town while the court\r\nwas sitting, that kinsman, or be he what he liked, should never darken\r\nmy door again." And then, Alan, I thought to turn the ball our own way;\r\nand I said that you were a gey sharp birkie, just off the irons, and if\r\nit would oblige my lord, and so forth, you would open Peter\'s cause on\r\nTuesday, and make some handsome apology for the necessary absence of\r\nyour learned friend, and the loss which your client and the court had\r\nsustained, and so forth. Peter lap at the proposition like a cock at a\r\ngrossart; for, he said, the only chance was to get a new hand, that did\r\nnot ken the charge he was taking upon him; for there was not a lad of\r\ntwo sessions\' standing that was not dead-sick of Peter Peebles and his\r\ncause; and he advised me to break the matter gently to you at the\r\nfirst; but I told him you were, a good bairn, Alan, and had no will and\r\npleasure in these matters but mine.\'\r\n\r\nWhat could I say, Darsie, in answer to this arrangement, so very well\r\nmeant--so very vexatious at the same time? To imitate the defection and\r\nflight of young Dumtoustie, was at once to destroy my father\'s hopes\r\nof me for ever; nay, such is the keenness with which he regards all\r\nconnected with his profession, it might have been a step to breaking\r\nhis heart. I was obliged, therefore, to bow in sad acquiescence, when my\r\nfather called to James Wilkinson to bring the two bits of pokes he would\r\nfind on his table.\r\n\r\nExit James, and presently re-enters, bending under the load of two huge\r\nleathern bags, full of papers to the brim, and labelled on the greasy\r\nbacks with the magic impress of the clerks of court, and the title,\r\nPEEBLES AGAINST PLAINSTANES. This huge mass was deposited on the table,\r\nand my father, with no ordinary glee in his countenance, began to draw\r\nout; the various bundles of papers, secured by none of your red tape\r\nor whipcord, but stout, substantial casts of tarred rope, such as might\r\nhave held small craft at their moorings.\r\n\r\nI made a last and desperate effort to get rid of the impending job. \'I\r\nam really afraid, sir, that this case seems so much complicated, and\r\nthere is so little time to prepare, that we had better move the court to\r\nsupersede it till next session.\'\r\n\r\n\'How, sir?--how, Alan?\' said my father--\'Would you approbate and\r\nreprobate, sir? You have accepted the poor man\'s cause, and if you have\r\nnot his fee in your pocket, it is because he has none to give you; and\r\nnow would you approbate and reprobate in the same breath of your mouth?\r\nThink of your oath of office, Alan, and your duty to your father, my\r\ndear boy.\'\r\n\r\nOnce more, what could I say? I saw from my father\'s hurried and alarmed\r\nmanner, that nothing could vex him so much as failing in the point he\r\nhad determined to carry, and once more intimated my readiness to do my\r\nbest, under every disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, my boy,\' said my father, \'the Lord will make your days long\r\nin the land, for the honour you have given to your father\'s grey hairs.\r\nYou may find wiser advisers, Alan, but none that can wish you better.\'\r\n\r\nMy father, you know, does not usually give way to expressions of\r\naffection, and they are interesting in proportion to their rarity. My\r\neyes began to fill at seeing his glisten; and my delight at having given\r\nhim such sensible gratification would have been unmixed but for the\r\nthoughts of you. These out of the question, I could have grappled with\r\nthe bags, had they been as large as corn-sacks. But, to turn what\r\nwas grave into farce, the door opened, and Wilkinson ushered in Peter\r\nPeebles.\r\n\r\nYou must have seen this original, Darsie, who, like others in the same\r\npredicament, continues to haunt the courts of justice, where he has made\r\nshipwreck of time, means, and understanding. Such insane paupers have\r\nsometimes seemed to me to resemble wrecks lying upon the shoals on the\r\nGoodwin Sands, or in Yarmouth Roads, warning other vessels to keep aloof\r\nfrom the banks on which they have been lost; or rather, such ruined\r\nclients are like scarecrows and potato-bogies, distributed through the\r\ncourts to scare away fools from the scene of litigation.\r\n\r\nThe identical Peter wears a huge greatcoat threadbare and patched\r\nitself, yet carefully so disposed and secured by what buttons remain,\r\nand many supplementary pins, as to conceal the still more infirm state\r\nof his under garments. The shoes and stockings of a ploughman were,\r\nhowever, seen to meet at his knees with a pair of brownish, blackish\r\nbreeches; a rusty-coloured handkerchief, that has been black in its\r\nday, surrounded his throat, and was an apology for linen. His hair, half\r\ngrey, half black, escaped in elf-locks around a huge wig, made of tow,\r\nas it seemed to me, and so much shrunk that it stood up on the very top\r\nof his head; above which he plants, when covered, an immense cocked hat,\r\nwhich, like the chieftain\'s banner in an ancient battle, may be seen\r\nany sederunt day betwixt nine and ten, high towering above all\r\nthe fluctuating and changeful scene in the Outer House, where his\r\neccentricities often make him the centre of a group of petulant and\r\nteasing boys, who exercise upon him every art of ingenious torture.\r\nHis countenance, originally that of a portly, comely burgess, is now\r\nemaciated with poverty and anxiety, and rendered wild by an insane\r\nlightness about the eyes; a withered and blighted skin and complexion;\r\nfeatures begrimed with snuff, charged with the self-importance peculiar\r\nto insanity; and a habit of perpetually speaking to himself. Such was\r\nmy unfortunate client; and I must allow, Darsie, that my profession had\r\nneed to do a great deal of good, if, as is much to be feared, it brings\r\nmany individuals to such a pass.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been, with a good deal of form, presented to each other,\r\nat which time I easily saw by my father\'s manner that he was desirous of\r\nsupporting Peter\'s character in my eyes, as much as circumstances would\r\npermit, \'Alan,\' he said, \'this is the gentleman who has agreed to accept\r\nof you as his counsel, in place of young Dumtoustie.\'\r\n\r\n\'Entirely out of favour to my old acquaintance your father, said Peter.\r\nwith a benign and patronizing countenance, \'out of respect to your\r\nfather, and my old intimacy with Lord Bladderskate. Otherwise, by the\r\nREGIAM MAJESTATEM! I would have presented a petition and complaint\r\nagainst Daniel Dumtoustie, Advocate, by name and surname--I would, by\r\nall the practiques!--I know the forms of process; and I am not to be\r\ntriffled with.\'\r\n\r\nMy father here interrupted my client, and reminded him that there was a\r\ngood deal of business to do, as he proposed to give the young counsel\r\nan outline of the state of the conjoined process, with a view to letting\r\nhim into the merits of the cause, disencumbered from the points of form.\r\n\'I have made a short abbreviate, Mr. Peebles,\' said he; \'having sat up\r\nlate last night, and employed much of this morning in wading through\r\nthese papers, to save Alan some trouble, and I am now about to state the\r\nresult.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will state it myself,\' said Peter, breaking in without reverence upon\r\nhis solicitor.\r\n\r\n\'No, by no means,\' said my father; \'I am your agent for the time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mine eleventh in number,\' said Peter; \'I have a new one every year; I\r\nwish I could get a new coat as regularly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your agent for the time,\' resumed my father; \'and you, who are\r\nacquainted with the forms, know that the client states the cause to the\r\nagent--the agent to the counsel\'--\r\n\r\n\'The counsel to the Lord Ordinary,\' continued Peter, once set a-going,\r\nlike the peal of an alarm clock, \'the Ordinary to the Inner House, the\r\nPresident to the Bench. It is just like the rope to the man, the man to\r\nthe ox, the ox to the water, the water to the fire\'--\r\n\r\n\'Hush, for Heaven\'s sake, Mr. Peebles,\' said my father, cutting his\r\nrecitation short; \'time wears on--we must get to business--you must\r\nnot interrupt the court, you know.--Hem, hem! From this abbreviate it\r\nappears\'--\r\n\r\n\'Before you begin,\' said Peter Peebles \'I\'ll thank you to order me a\r\nmorsel of bread and cheese, or some cauld meat, or broth, or the like\r\nalimentary provision; I was so anxious to see your son, that I could not\r\neat a mouthful of dinner.\'\r\n\r\nHeartily glad, I believe, to have so good a chance of stopping his\r\nclient\'s mouth effectually, my father ordered some cold meat; to which\r\nJames Wilkinson, for the honour of the house, was about to add the\r\nbrandy bottle, which remained on the sideboard, but, at a wink from my\r\nfather, supplied its place with small beer. Peter charged the provisions\r\nwith the rapacity of a famished lion; and so well did the diversion\r\nengage him, that though, while my father stated the case, he looked at\r\nhim repeatedly, as if he meant to interrupt his statement, yet he always\r\nfound more agreeable employment for his mouth, and returned to the\r\ncold beef with an avidity which convinced me he had not had such an\r\nopportunity for many a day of satiating his appetite. Omitting much\r\nformal phraseology, and many legal details, I will endeavour to give\r\nyou, in exchange for your fiddler\'s tale, the history of a litigant, or\r\nrather, the history of his lawsuit.\r\n\r\n\'Peter Peebles and Paul Plainstanes,\' said my father, entered into\r\npartnership, in the year--, as mercers and linendrapers, in the\r\nLuckenbooths, and carried on a great line of business to mutual\r\nadvantage. But the learned counsel needeth not to be told, SOCIETAS EST\r\nMATER DISCORDIARUM, partnership oft makes pleaship. The company being\r\ndissolved by mutual consent, in the year--, the affairs had to be wound\r\nup, and after certain attempts to settle the matter extra-judicially,\r\nit was at last brought into the court, and has branched out into several\r\ndistinct processes, most of whilk have been conjoined by the Ordinary.\r\nIt is to the state of these processes that counsel\'s attention is\r\nparticularly directed. There is the original action of Peebles v.\r\nPlainstanes, convening him for payment of 3000l., less or more, as\r\nalleged balance due by Plainstanes. Secondly, there is a counter action,\r\nin which Plainstanes is pursuer and Peebles defender, for 2500l.,\r\nless or more, being balance alleged per contra, to be due by Peebles.\r\nThirdly, Mr. Peeble\'s seventh agent advised an action of Compt and\r\nReckoning at his instance, wherein what balance should prove due on\r\neither side might be fairly struck and ascertained. Fourthly, to meet\r\nthe hypothetical case, that Peebles might be found liable in a balance\r\nto Plainstanes, Mr. Wildgoose, Mr. Peebles\'s eighth agent, recommended a\r\nMultiplepoinding, to bring all parties concerned into the field.\'\r\n\r\nMy brain was like to turn at this account of lawsuit within lawsuit,\r\nlike a nest of chip-boxes, with all of which I was expected to make\r\nmyself acquainted.\r\n\r\n\'I understand,\' I said, \'that Mr. Peebles claims a sum of money from\r\nPlainstanes--how then can he be his debtor? and if not his debtor, how\r\ncan he bring a Multiplepoinding, the very summons of which sets forth,\r\nthat the pursuer does owe certain monies, which he is desirous to pay by\r\nwarrant of a judge?\' [Multiplepoinding is, I believe, equivalent to what\r\nis called in England a case of Double Distress.]\r\n\r\n\'Ye know little of the matter, I doubt, friend,\' said Mr. Peebles; \'a\r\nMultiplepoinding is the safest REMEDIUM JURIS in the whole; form of\r\nprocess. I have known it conjoined with a declarator of marriage.--Your\r\nbeef is excellent,\' he said to my father, who in vain endeavoured to\r\nresume his legal disquisition; \'but something highly powdered--and the\r\ntwopenny is undeniable; but it is small swipes--small swipes--more of\r\nhop than malt-with your leave, I\'ll try your black bottle.\'\r\n\r\nMy father started to help him with his own hand, and in due measure;\r\nbut, infinitely to my amusement, Peter got possession of the bottle by\r\nthe neck, and my father\'s ideas of hospitality were far too scrupulous\r\nto permit his attempting, by any direct means, to redeem it; so that\r\nPeter returned to the table triumphant, with his prey in his clutch.\r\n\r\n\'Better have a wine-glass, Mr. Peebles,\' said my father, in an\r\nadmonitory tone, \'you will find it pretty strong.\'\r\n\r\n\'If the kirk is ower muckle, we can sing mass in the quire,\' said Peter,\r\nhelping himself in the goblet out of which he had been drinking the\r\nsmall beer. \'What is it, usquebaugh?--BRANDY, as I am an honest man! I\r\nhad almost forgotten the name and taste of brandy. Mr. Fairford elder,\r\nyour good health\' (a mouthful of brandy), \'Mr. Alan Fairford, wishing\r\nyou well through your arduous undertaking\' (another go-down of the\r\ncomfortable liquor). \'And now, though you have given a tolerable\r\nbreviate of this great lawsuit, of whilk everybody has heard something\r\nthat has walked the boards in the Outer House (here\'s to ye again,\r\nby way of interim decreet) yet ye have omitted to speak a word of the\r\narrestments.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was just coming to that point, Mr. Peebles.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or of the action of suspension of the charge on the bill.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was just coming to that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or the advocation of the Sheriff-Court process.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was just coming to it.\'\r\n\r\n\'As Tweed comes to Melrose, I think,\' said the litigant; and then\r\nfilling his goblet about a quarter full of brandy, as if in absence of\r\nmind, \'Oh, Mr. Alan Fairford, ye are a lucky man to buckle to such a\r\ncause as mine at the very outset! it is like a specimen of all causes,\r\nman. By the Regiam, there is not a REMEDIUM JURIS in the practiques\r\nbut ye\'ll find a spice o\'t. Here\'s to your getting weel through with\r\nit--Pshut--I am drinking naked spirits, I think. But if the heathen he\r\nower strong, we\'ll christen him with the brewer\' (here he added a\r\nlittle small beer to his beverage, paused, rolled his eyes, winked,\r\nand proceeded),--\'Mr. Fairford--the action of assault and battery,\r\nMr. Fairford, when I compelled the villain Plainstanes to pull my\r\nnose within two steps of King Charles\'s statue, in the Parliament\r\nClose--there I had him in a hose-net. Never man could tell me how to\r\nshape that process--no counsel that ever selled mind could condescend\r\nand say whether it were best to proceed by way of petition and\r\ncomplaint, AD VINDICTAM PUBLICAM, with consent of his Majesty\'s\r\nadvocate, or by action on the statute for battery PENDENTE LITE, whilk\r\nwould be the winning my plea at once, and so getting a back-door out of\r\ncourt.--By the Regiam, that beef and brandy is unco het at my heart--I\r\nmaun try the ale again\' (sipped a little beer); \'and the ale\'s but\r\ncauld, I maun e\'en put in the rest of the brandy.\'\r\n\r\nHe was as good as his word, and proceeded in so loud and animated\r\na style of elocution, thumping the table, drinking and snuffing\r\nalternately, that my father, abandoning all attempts to interrupt him,\r\nsat silent and ashamed, suffering, and anxious for the conclusion of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\'And then to come back to my pet process of all--my battery and assault\r\nprocess, when I had the good luck to provoke him to pull my nose at\r\nthe very threshold of the court, whilk was the very thing I wanted--Mr.\r\nPest, ye ken him, Daddie Fairford? Old Pest was for making it out\r\nHAMESUCKEN, for he said the court might be said--said--ugh!--to be my\r\ndwelling-place. I dwell mair there than ony gate else, and the essence\r\nof hamesucken is to strike a man in his dwelling-place--mind that, young\r\nadvocate--and so there\'s hope Plainstanes may be hanged, as many has\r\nfor a less matter; for, my lords,--will Pest say to the Justiciary\r\nbodies,--my lords, the Parliament House is Peebles\' place of\r\ndwelling, says he--being COMMUNE FORUM, and COMMUNE FORUM EST COMMUNE\r\nDOMICILIUM--Lass, fetch another glass of and score it--time to gae\r\nhame--by the practiques, I cannot find the jug--yet there\'s twa of them,\r\nI think. By the Regiam, Fairford--Daddie Fairford--lend us twal pennies\r\nto buy sneeshing, mine is done--Macer, call another cause.\'\r\n\r\nThe box fell from his hands, and his body would at the same time have\r\nfallen from the chair, had not I supported him.\r\n\r\n\'This is intolerable,\' said my father--\'Call a chairman, James\r\nWilkinson, to carry this degraded, worthless, drunken beast home.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Peter Peebles was removed from this memorable consultation, under\r\nthe care of an able-bodied Celt, my father hastily bundled up the\r\npapers, as a showman, whose exhibition has miscarried, hastes to remove\r\nhis booth. \'Here are my memoranda, Alan,\' he said, in a hurried way;\r\n\'look them carefully over--compare them with the processes, and turn\r\nit in your head before Tuesday. Many a good speech has been made for a\r\nbeast of a client; and hark ye, lad, hark ye--I never intended to cheat\r\nyou of your fee when all was done, though I would have liked to have\r\nheard the speech first; but there is nothing like corning the horse\r\nbefore the journey. Here are five goud guineas in a silk purse--of your\r\npoor mother\'s netting, Alan--she would have been a blithe woman to have\r\nseen her young son with a gown on his back--but no more of that--be a\r\ngood boy, and to the work like a tiger.\'\r\n\r\nI did set to work, Darsie; for who could resist such motives? With my\r\nfather\'s assistance, I have mastered the details, confused as they are;\r\nand on Tuesday I shall plead as well for Peter Peebles as I could for\r\na duke. Indeed, I feel my head so clear on the subject as to be able\r\nto write this long letter to you; into which, however, Peter and his\r\nlawsuit have insinuated themselves so far as to show you how much they\r\nat present occupy my thoughts. Once more, be careful of yourself, and\r\nmindful of me, who am ever thine, while ALAN FAIRFORD.\r\n\r\nFrom circumstances, to be hereafter mentioned, it was long ere this\r\nletter reached the person to whom it was addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n          * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE\r\n\r\nThe advantage of laying before the reader, in the words of the actors\r\nthemselves, the adventures which we must otherwise have narrated in\r\nour own, has given great popularity to the publication of epistolary\r\ncorrespondence, as practised by various great authors, and by ourselves\r\nin the preceding chapters. Nevertheless, a genuine correspondence of\r\nthis kind (and Heaven forbid it should be in any respect sophisticated\r\nby interpolations of our own!) can seldom be found to contain all in\r\nwhich it is necessary to instruct the reader for his full comprehension\r\nof the story. Also it must often happen that various prolixities and\r\nredundancies occur in the course of an interchange of letters, which\r\nmust hang as a dead weight on the progress of the narrative. To avoid\r\nthis dilemma, some biographers have used the letters of the personages\r\nconcerned, or liberal extracts from them, to describe particular\r\nincidents, or express the sentiments which they entertained; while they\r\nconnect them occasionally with such portions of narrative, as may serve\r\nto carry on the thread of the story.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that the adventurous travellers who explore the summit of\r\nMont Blanc now move on through the crumbling snowdrift so slowly, that\r\ntheir progress is almost imperceptible, and anon abridge their journey\r\nby springing over the intervening chasms which cross their path, with\r\nthe assistance of their pilgrim-staves. Or, to make a briefer simile,\r\nthe course of story-telling which we have for the present adopted,\r\nresembles the original discipline of the dragoons, who were trained to\r\nserve either on foot or horseback, as the emergencies of the service\r\nrequired. With this explanation, we shall proceed to narrate some\r\ncircumstances which Alan Fairford did not, and could not, write to his\r\ncorrespondent.\r\n\r\nOur reader, we trust, has formed somewhat approaching to a distinct\r\nidea of the principal characters who have appeared before him during\r\nour narrative; but in case our good opinion of his sagacity has been\r\nexaggerated, and in order to satisfy such as are addicted to the\r\nlaudable practice of SKIPPING (with whom we have at times a strong\r\nfellow-feeling), the following particulars may not be superfluous.\r\n\r\nMr. Saunders Fairford, as he was usually called, was a man of business\r\nof the old school, moderate in his charges, economical and even\r\nniggardly in his expenditure, strictly honest in conducting his own\r\naffairs and those of his clients, but taught by long experience to be\r\nwary and suspicious in observing the motions of others. Punctual as the\r\nclock of Saint Giles tolled nine, the neat dapper form of the little\r\nhale old gentleman was seen at the threshold of the court hall, or at\r\nfarthest, at the head of the Back Stairs, trimly dressed in a complete\r\nsuit of snuff-coloured brown, with stockings of silk or woollen as,\r\nsuited the weather; a bob-wig, and a small cocked hat; shoes blacked\r\nas Warren would have blacked them; silver shoe-buckles, and a gold\r\nstock-buckle. A nosegay in summer, and a sprig of holly in winter,\r\ncompleted his well-known dress and appearance. His manners corresponded\r\nwith his attire, for they were scrupulously civil, and not a little\r\nformal. He was an elder of the kirk, and, of course, zealous for King\r\nGeorge and the Government even to slaying, as he had showed by taking\r\nup arms in their cause. But then, as he had clients and connexions\r\nof business among families of opposite political tenets, he was\r\nparticularly cautious to use all the conventional phrases which the\r\ncivility of the time had devised, as an admissible mode of language\r\nbetwixt the two parties. Thus he spoke sometimes of the Chevalier, but\r\nnever either of the Prince, which would have been sacrificing his own\r\nprinciples, or of the Pretender, which would have been offensive to\r\nthose of others. Again, he usually designated the Rebellion as the\r\nAFFAIR of 1745, and spoke of any one engaged in it as a person who had\r\nbeen OUT at a certain period. [OLD-FASHIONED SCOTTISH CIVILITY.--Such\r\nwere literally the points of politeness observed in general society\r\nduring the author\'s youth, where it was by no means unusual in a company\r\nassembled by chance, to find individuals who had borne arms on one\r\nside or other in the civil broils of 1745. Nothing, according to my\r\nrecollection, could be more gentle and decorous than the respect\r\nthese old enemies paid to each other\'s prejudices. But in this I speak\r\ngenerally. I have witnessed one or two explosions.] So that, on the\r\nwhole, Mr. Fairford was a man much liked and respected on all sides,\r\nthough his friends would not have been sorry if he had given a dinner\r\nmore frequently, as his little cellar contained some choice old wine, of\r\nwhich, on such rare occasions he was no niggard.\r\n\r\nThe whole pleasure of this good old-fashioned man of method, besides\r\nthat which he really felt in the discharge of his daily business, was\r\nthe hope to see his son Alan, the only fruit of a union which death\r\nearly dissolved, attain what in the father\'s eyes was the proudest of\r\nall distinctions--the rank and fame of a well-employed lawyer.\r\n\r\nEvery profession has its peculiar honours, and Mr. Fairford\'s mind was\r\nconstructed upon so limited and exclusive a plan, that he valued nothing\r\nsave the objects of ambition which his own presented. He would have\r\nshuddered at Alan\'s acquiring the renown of a hero, and laughed with\r\nscorn at the equally barren laurels of literature; it was by the path of\r\nthe law alone that he was desirous to see him rise to eminence, and\r\nthe probabilities of success or disappointment were the thoughts of his\r\nfather by day, and his dream by night.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of Alan Fairford, as well as his talents, were such as\r\nto encourage his father\'s expectations. He had acuteness of intellect,\r\njoined to habits of long and patient study, improved no doubt by the\r\ndiscipline of his father\'s house; to which, generally speaking, he\r\nconformed with the utmost docility, expressing no wish for greater or\r\nmore frequent relaxation than consisted with his father\'s anxious and\r\nsevere restrictions. When he did indulge in any juvenile frolics, his\r\nfather had the candour to lay the whole blame upon his more mercurial\r\ncompanion, Darsie Latimer.\r\n\r\nThis youth, as the reader must be aware, had been received as an inmate\r\ninto the family of Mr. Fairford, senior, at a time when some of the\r\ndelicacy of constitution which had abridged the life of his consort\r\nbegan to show itself in the son, and when the father was, of course,\r\npeculiarly disposed to indulge his slightest wish. That the young\r\nEnglishman was able to pay a considerable board, was a matter of no\r\nimportance to Mr. Fairford; it was enough that his presence seemed to\r\nmake his son cheerful and happy. He was compelled to allow that \'Darsie\r\nwas a fine lad, though unsettled,\' and he would have had some difficulty\r\nin getting rid of him, and the apprehensions which his levities excited,\r\nhad it not been for the voluntary excursion which gave rise to the\r\npreceding correspondence, and in which Mr. Fairford secretly rejoiced,\r\nas affording the means of separating Alan from his gay companion, at\r\nleast until he should have assumed, and become accustomed to, the duties\r\nof his dry and laborious profession.\r\n\r\nBut the absence of Darsie was far from promoting the end which the elder\r\nMr. Fairford had expected and desired. The young men were united by the\r\nclosest bonds of intimacy; and the more so, that neither of them sought\r\nnor desired to admit any others into their society. Alan Fairford was\r\naverse to general company, from a disposition naturally reserved,\r\nand Darsie Latimer from a painful sense of his own unknown origin,\r\npeculiarly afflicting in a country where high and low are professed\r\ngenealogists. The young men were all in all to each other; it is no\r\nwonder, therefore, that their separation was painful, and that its\r\neffects upon Alan Fairford, joined to the anxiety occasioned by the\r\ntenor of his friend\'s letters, greatly exceeded what the senior had\r\nanticipated. The young man went through his usual duties, his studies,\r\nand the examinations to which he was subjected, but with nothing like\r\nthe zeal and assiduity which he had formerly displayed; and his anxious\r\nand observant father saw but too plainly that his heart was with his\r\nabsent comrade.\r\n\r\nA philosopher would have given way to this tide of feeling, in hopes to\r\nhave diminished its excess, and permitted the youths to have been\r\nsome time together, that their intimacy might have been broken off by\r\ndegrees; but Mr. Fairford only saw the more direct mode of continued\r\nrestraint, which, however, he was desirous of veiling under some\r\nplausible pretext. In the anxiety which he felt on this occasion, he had\r\nheld communication with an old acquaintance, Peter Drudgeit, with whom\r\nthe reader is partly acquainted. \'Alan,\' he said, \'was ance wud, and\r\nay waur; and he was expecting every moment when he would start off in a\r\nwildgoose-chase after the callant Latimer; Will Sampson, the horse-hirer\r\nin Candlemaker Row, had given him a hint that Alan had been looking for\r\na good hack, to go to the country for a few days. And then to oppose\r\nhim downright--he could not but think on the way his poor mother was\r\nremoved. Would to Heaven he was yoked to some tight piece of business,\r\nno matter whether well or ill paid, but some job that would hamshackle\r\nhim at least until the courts rose, if it were but for decency\'s sake.\'\r\n\r\nPeter Drudgeit sympathized, for Peter had a son, who, reason or none,\r\nwould needs exchange the torn and inky fustian sleeves for the blue\r\njacket and white lapelle; and he suggested, as the reader knows, the\r\nengaging our friend Alan in the matter of Poor Peter Peebles, just\r\nopened by the desertion of young Dumtoustie, whose defection would be at\r\nthe same time concealed; and this, Drudgeit said, \'would be felling two\r\ndogs with one stone.\'\r\n\r\nWith these explanations, the reader will hold a man of the elder\r\nFairford\'s sense and experience free from the hazardous and impatient\r\ncuriosity with which boys fling a puppy into a deep pond, merely to see\r\nif the creature can swim. However confident in his son\'s talents, which\r\nwere really considerable, he would have been very sorry to have involved\r\nhim in the duty of pleading a complicated and difficult case, upon\r\nhis very first appearance at the bar, had he not resorted to it as an\r\neffectual way to prevent the young man from taking a step which his\r\nhabits of thinking represented as a most fatal one at his outset of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBetwixt two evils, Mr. Fairford chose that which was in his own\r\napprehension the least; and, like a brave officer sending forth his son\r\nto battle, rather chose he should die upon the breach, than desert the\r\nconflict with dishonour. Neither did he leave him to his own unassisted\r\nenergies. Like Alpheus preceding Hercules, he himself encountered the\r\nAugean mass of Peter Peebles\' law-matters. It was to the old man a\r\nlabour of love to place in a clear and undistorted view the real merits\r\nof this case, which the carelessness and blunders of Peter\'s former\r\nsolicitors had converted into a huge chaotic mass of unintelligible\r\ntechnicality; and such was his skill and industry, that he was\r\nable, after the severe toil of two or three days, to present to the\r\nconsideration of the young counsel the principal facts of the case, in\r\na light equally simple and comprehensible. With the assistance of a\r\nsolicitor so affectionate and indefatigable, Alan Fairford was enabled,\r\nthen the day of trial arrived, to walk towards the court, attended by\r\nhis anxious yet encouraging parent, with some degree of confidence that\r\nhe would lose no reputation upon this arduous occasion.\r\n\r\nThey were met at the door of the court by Poor Peter Peebles in his\r\nusual plenitude of wig and celsitude of hat. He seized on the young\r\npleader like a lion on his prey. \'How is a\' wi\' you, Mr. Alan--how is\r\na\' wi\' you, man? The awfu\' day is come at last--a day that will be lang\r\nminded in this house. Poor Peter Peebles against Plainstanes--conjoined\r\nproceases--Hearing in presence--stands for the Short Roll for this\r\nday--I have not been able to sleep for a week for thinking of it, and, I\r\ndare to say, neither has the Lord President himsell--for such a cause!!\r\nBut your father garr\'d me tak a wee drap ower muckle of his pint bottle\r\nthe other night; it\'s no right to mix brandy wi\' business, Mr. Fairford.\r\nI would have been the waur o\' liquor if I would have drank as muckle as\r\nyou twa would have had me. But there\'s a time for a\' things, and if\r\nye will dine with me after the case is heard, or whilk is the same, or\r\nmaybe better, I\'LL gang my ways hame wi\' YOU, and I winna object to a\r\ncheerfu\' glass, within the bounds of moderation.\'\r\n\r\nOld Fairford shrugged his shoulders and hurried past the client, saw\r\nhis son wrapped in the sable bombazine, which, in his eyes, was more\r\nvenerable than an archbishop\'s lawn, and could not help fondly patting\r\nhis shoulder, and whispering to him to take courage, and show he was\r\nworthy to wear it. The party entered the Outer Hall of the court, (once\r\nthe place of meeting of the ancient Scottish Parliament), and which\r\ncorresponds to the use of Westminster Hall in England, serving as a\r\nvestibule to the Inner House, as it is termed, and a place of dominion\r\nto certain sedentary personages called Lords Ordinary.\r\n\r\nThe earlier part of the morning was spent by old Fairford in reiterating\r\nhis instructions to Alan, and in running from one person to another,\r\nfrom whom he thought he could still glean some grains of information,\r\neither concerning the point at issue, or collateral cases. Meantime,\r\nPoor Peter Peebles, whose shallow brain was altogether unable to bear\r\nthe importance of the moment, kept as close to his young counsel as\r\nshadow to substance, affected now to speak loud, now to whisper in his\r\near, now to deck his ghastly countenance with wreathed smiles, now to\r\ncloud it with a shade of deep and solemn importance, and anon to contort\r\nit with the sneer of scorn and derision. These moods of the client\'s\r\nmind were accompanied with singular \'mockings and mowings,\' fantastic\r\ngestures, which the man of rags and litigation deemed appropriate to his\r\nchanges of countenance. Now he brandished his arm aloft, now thrust his\r\nfist straight out, as if to knock his opponent down. Now he laid his\r\nopen palm on his bosom, and now hinging it abroad, he gallantly snapped\r\nhis fingers in the air.\r\n\r\nThese demonstrations, and the obvious shame and embarrassment of Alan\r\nFairford, did not escape the observation of the juvenile idlers in the\r\nhall. They did not, indeed, approach Peter with their usual familiarity,\r\nfrom some feeling of deference towards Fairford, though many accused\r\nhim of conceit in presuming to undertake, at this early stage of his\r\npractice, a case of considerable difficulty. But Alan, notwithstanding\r\nthis forbearance, was not the less sensible that he and his companion\r\nwere the subjects of many a passing jest, and many a shout of laughter,\r\nwith which that region at all times abounds.\r\n\r\nAt length the young counsel\'s patience gave way, and as it threatened to\r\ncarry his presence of mind and recollection along with it, Alan frankly\r\ntold his father, that unless he was relieved from the infliction of his\r\nclient\'s personal presence and instructions, he must necessarily throw\r\nup his brief, and decline pleading the case.\r\n\r\n\'Hush, hush, my dear Alan,\' said the old gentleman, almost at his\r\nown wit\'s end upon hearing this dilemma; \'dinna mind the silly\r\nne\'er-do-weel; we cannot keep the man from hearing his own cause, though\r\nhe be not quite right in the head.\'\r\n\r\n\'On my life, sir,\' answered Alan, \'I shall be unable to go on, he drives\r\neverything out of my remembrance; and if I attempt to speak seriously of\r\nthe injuries he has sustained, and the condition he is reduced to, how\r\ncan I expect but that the very appearance of such an absurd scarecrow\r\nwill turn it all into ridicule?\'\r\n\r\n\'There is something in that,\' said Saunders Fairford, glancing a look\r\nat Poor Peter, and then cautiously inserting his forefinger under his\r\nbob-wig, in order to rub his temple and aid his invention; \'he is no\r\nfigure for the fore-bar to see without laughing; but how to get rid\r\nof him? To speak sense, or anything like it, is the last thing he will\r\nlisten to. Stay, aye,--Alan, my darling, hae patience; I\'ll get him off\r\non the instant, like a gowff ba\'.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he hastened to his ally, Peter Drudgeit, who on seeing him\r\nwith marks of haste in his gait, and care upon his countenance, clapped\r\nhis pen behind his ear, with \'What\'s the stir now, Mr. Saunders? Is\r\nthere aught wrang?\'\r\n\r\n\'Here\'s a dollar, man,\' said Mr. Saunders; \'now, or never, Peter, do me\r\na good turn. Yonder\'s your namesake, Peter Peebles, will drive the swine\r\nthrough our bonny hanks of yarn; get him over to John\'s Coffeehouse,\r\nman--gie him his meridian--keep him there, drunk or sober, till the\r\nhearing is ower.\' [The simile is obvious, from the old manufacture of\r\nScotland, when the gudewife\'s thrift, as the yarn wrought in the winter\r\nwas called, when laid down to bleach by the burn-side, was peculiarly\r\nexposed to the inroads of pigs, seldom well regulated about a Scottish\r\nfarm-house.]\r\n\r\n\'Eneugh said,\' quoth Peter Drudgeit, no way displeased with his own\r\nshare in the service required, \'We\'se do your bidding.\'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the scribe was presently seen whispering in the ear of\r\nPeter Peebles, whose response came forth in the following broken form:--\r\n\r\n\'Leave the court for ae minute on this great day of judgement? not I, by\r\nthe Reg--Eh! what? Brandy, did ye say--French brandy?--couldna ye fetch\r\na stoup to the bar under your coat, man? Impossible? Nay, if it\'s clean\r\nimpossible, and if we have an hour good till they get through the single\r\nbill and the summar-roll, I carena if I cross the close wi\' you; I am\r\nsure I need something to keep my heart up this awful day; but I\'ll no\r\nstay above an instant--not above a minute of time--nor drink aboon a\r\nsingle gill,\'\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes afterwards, the two Peters were seen moving through the\r\nParliament Close (which new-fangled affectation has termed a Square),\r\nthe triumphant Drudgeit leading captive the passive Peebles, whose legs\r\nconducted him towards the dramshop, while his reverted eyes were\r\nfixed upon the court. They dived into the Cimmerian abysses of John\'s\r\nCoffeehouse, [See Note 5.] formerly the favourite rendezvous of the\r\nclassical and genial Doctor Pitcairn, and were for the present seen no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nRelieved from his tormentor, Alan Fairford had time to rally his\r\nrecollections, which, in the irritation of his spirits, had nearly\r\nescaped him, and to prepare himself far a task, the successful discharge\r\nor failure in which must, he was aware, have the deepest influence upon\r\nhis fortunes. He had pride, was not without a consciousness of talent,\r\nand the sense of his father\'s feelings upon the subject impelled him to\r\nthe utmost exertion. Above all, he had that sort of self-command\r\nwhich is essential to success in every arduous undertaking, and he was\r\nconstitutionally free from that feverish irritability by which\r\nthose whose over-active imaginations exaggerate difficulties, render\r\nthemselves incapable of encountering such when they arrive.\r\n\r\nHaving collected all the scattered and broken associations which were\r\nnecessary, Alan\'s thoughts reverted to Dumfriesshire, and the precarious\r\nsituation in which he feared his beloved friend had placed himself; and\r\nonce and again he consulted his watch, eager to have his present task\r\ncommenced and ended, that he might hasten to Darsie\'s assistance. The\r\nhour and moment at length arrived. The macer shouted, with all his\r\nwell-remembered brazen strength of lungs, \'Poor Peter Peebles VERSUS\r\nPlainstanes, PER Dumtoustie ET Tough!--Maister Da-a-niel Dumtoustie!\'\r\nDumtoustie answered not the summons, which, deep and swelling as it was,\r\ncould not reach across the Queensferry; but our Maister Alan Fairford\r\nappeared in his place.\r\n\r\nThe court was very much crowded; for much amusement had been received\r\non former occasions when Peter had volunteered his own oratory, and\r\nhad been completely successful in routing the gravity of the whole\r\nprocedure, and putting to silence, not indeed the counsel of the\r\nopposite party, but his own.\r\n\r\nBoth bench and audience seemed considerably surprised at the juvenile\r\nappearance of the young man who appeared in the room of Dumtoustie, for\r\nthe purpose of opening this complicated and long depending process, and\r\nthe common herd were disappointed at the absence of Peter the client,\r\nthe Punchinello of the expected entertainment. The judges looked with\r\na very favourable countenance on our friend Alan, most of them being\r\nacquainted, more or less, with so old a practitioner as his father, and\r\nall, or almost all, affording, from civility, the same fair play to the\r\nfirst pleading of a counsel, which the House of Commons yields to the\r\nmaiden speech of one of its members.\r\n\r\nLord Bladderskate was an exception to this general expression of\r\nbenevolence. He scowled upon Alan, from beneath his large, shaggy, grey\r\neyebrows, just as if the young lawyer had been usurping his nephew\'s\r\nhonours, instead of covering his disgrace; and, from feelings which did\r\nhis lordship little honour, he privately hoped the young man would not\r\nsucceed in the cause which his kinsman had abandoned.\r\n\r\nEven Lord Bladderskate, however, was, in spite of himself, pleased with\r\nthe judicious and modest tone in which Alan began his address to the\r\ncourt, apologizing for his own presumption, and excusing it by the\r\nsudden illness of his learned brother, for whom the labour of opening\r\na cause of some difficulty and importance had been much more worthily\r\ndesigned. He spoke of himself as he really was, and of young Dumtoustie\r\nas what he ought to have been, taking care not to dwell on either topic\r\na moment longer than was necessary. The old judge\'s looks became benign;\r\nhis family pride was propitiated, and, pleased equally with the modesty\r\nand civility of the young man whom he had thought forward and officious,\r\nhe relaxed the scorn of his features into an expression of profound\r\nattention; the highest compliment, and the greatest encouragement, which\r\na judge can render to the counsel addressing him.\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in securing the favourable attention of the court,\r\nthe young lawyer, using the lights which his father\'s experience and\r\nknowledge of business had afforded him, proceeded with an address and\r\nclearness, unexpected from one of his years, to remove from the case\r\nitself those complicated formalities with which it had been loaded, as a\r\nsurgeon strips from a wound the dressings which had been hastily wrapped\r\nround it, in order to proceed to his cure SECUNDUM ARTEM. Developed of\r\nthe cumbrous and complicated technicalities of litigation, with which\r\nthe perverse obstinacy of the client, the inconsiderate haste or\r\nignorance of his agents, and the evasions of a subtle adversary, had\r\ninvested the process, the cause of Poor Peter Peebles, standing upon\r\nits simple merits, was no bad subject for the declamation of a young\r\ncounsel, nor did our friend Alan fail to avail himself of its strong\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nHe exhibited his client as a simple-hearted, honest, well-meaning\r\nman, who, during a copartnership of twelve years, had gradually become\r\nimpoverished, while his partner (his former clerk) having no funds but\r\nhis share of the same business, into which he had been admitted without\r\nany advance of stock, had become gradually more and more wealthy.\r\n\r\n\'Their association,\' said Alan, and the little flight was received\r\nwith some applause, \'resembled the ancient story of the fruit which was\r\ncarved with a knife poisoned on one side of the blade only, so that\r\nthe individual to whom the envenomed portion was served, drew decay and\r\ndeath from what afforded savour and sustenance to the consumer of the\r\nother moiety.\' He then plunged boldly into the MARE MAGNUM of accompts\r\nbetween the parties; he pursued each false statement from the waste-book\r\nto the day-book, from the day-book to the bill-book, from the bill-book\r\nto the ledger; placed the artful interpolations and insertions of the\r\nfallacious Plainstanes in array against each other, and against the\r\nfact; and availing himself to the utmost of his father\'s previous\r\nlabours, and his own knowledge of accompts, in which he had been\r\nsedulously trained, he laid before the court a clear and intelligible\r\nstatement of the affairs of the copartnery, showing, with precision,\r\nthat a large balance must, at the dissolution, have been due to his\r\nclient, sufficient to have enabled him to have carried on business on\r\nhis own account, and thus to have retained his situation in society as\r\nan independent and industrious tradesman. \'But instead of this justice\r\nbeing voluntarily rendered by the former clerk to his former master,--by\r\nthe party obliged to his benefactor,--by one honest man to another,--his\r\nwretched client had been compelled to follow his quondam clerk, his\r\npresent debtor, from court to court; had found his just claims met with\r\nwell-invented but unfounded counter-claims, had seen his party shift\r\nhis character of pursuer or defender, as often as Harlequin effects his\r\ntransformations, till, in a chase so varied and so long, the unhappy\r\nlitigant had lost substance, reputation, and almost the use of reason\r\nitself, and came before their lordships an object of thoughtless\r\nderision to the unreflecting, of compassion to the better-hearted, and\r\nof awful meditation to every one who considered that, in a country where\r\nexcellent laws were administered by upright and incorruptible judges, a\r\nman might pursue an almost indisputable claim through all the mazes of\r\nlitigation; lose fortune, reputation, and reason itself in the chase,\r\nand now come before the supreme court of his country in the wretched\r\ncondition of his unhappy client, a victim to protracted justice, and to\r\nthat hope delayed which sickens the heart.\'\r\n\r\nThe force of this appeal to feeling made as much impression on the Bench\r\nas had been previously effected by the clearness of Alan\'s argument.\r\nThe absurd form of Peter himself, with his tow-wig, was fortunately not\r\npresent to excite any ludicrous emotion, and the pause that took place\r\nwhen the young lawyer had concluded his speech, was followed by a murmur\r\nof approbation, which the ears of his father drank in as the sweetest\r\nsounds that had ever entered them. Many a hand of gratulation was thrust\r\nout to his grasp, trembling as it was with anxiety, and finally with\r\ndelight; his voice faltering as he replied, \'Aye, aye, I kend Alan was\r\nthe lad to make a spoon or spoil a horn.\' [Said of an adventurous gipsy,\r\nwho resolves at all risks to convert a sheep\'s horn into a spoon.]\r\n\r\nThe counsel on the other side arose, an old practitioner, who had noted\r\ntoo closely the impression made by Alan\'s pleading not to fear the\r\nconsequences of an immediate decision. He paid the highest compliments\r\nto his very young brother--\'the Benjamin, as he would presume to call\r\nhim, of the learned Faculty--said the alleged hardships of Mr.\r\nPeebles were compensated by his being placed in a situation where\r\nthe benevolence of their lordships had assigned him gratuitously such\r\nassistance as he might not otherwise have obtained at a high price--and\r\nallowed his young brother had put many things in such a new point of\r\nview, that, although he was quite certain of his ability to refute them,\r\nhe was honestly desirous of having a few hours to arrange his answer,\r\nin order to be able to follow Mr. Fairford from point to point. He\r\nhad further to observe, there was one point of the case to which\r\nhis brother, whose attention had been otherwise so wonderfully\r\ncomprehensive, had not given the consideration which he expected; it was\r\nfounded on the interpretation of certain correspondence which had passed\r\nbetwixt the parties soon after the dissolution of the copartnery.\'\r\n\r\nThe court having heard Mr. Tough, readily allowed him two days for\r\npreparing himself, hinting at the same time that he might find his task\r\ndifficult, and affording the young counsel, with high encomiums upon the\r\nmode in which he had acquitted himself, the choice of speaking,\r\neither now or at the next calling of the cause, upon the point which\r\nPlainstanes\'s lawyer had adverted to.\r\n\r\nAlan modestly apologized for what in fact had been an omission very\r\npardonable in so complicated a case, and professed himself instantly\r\nready to go through that correspondence, and prove that it was in\r\nform and substance exactly applicable to the view of the case he had\r\nsubmitted to their lordships. He applied to his father, who sat behind\r\nhim, to hand him, from time to time, the letters, in the order in which\r\nhe meant to read and comment upon them.\r\n\r\nOld Counsellor Tough had probably formed an ingenious enough scheme to\r\nblunt the effect of the young lawyer\'s reasoning, by thus obliging him\r\nto follow up a process of reasoning, clear and complete in itself, by\r\na hasty and extemporary appendix. If so, he seemed likely to be\r\ndisappointed; for Alan was well prepared on this as on other parts of\r\nthe cause, and recommenced his pleading with a degree of animation which\r\nadded force even to what he had formerly stated, and might perhaps have\r\noccasioned the old gentleman to regret his having again called him up,\r\nwhen his father, as he handed him the letters, put one into his hand\r\nwhich produced a singular effect on the pleader.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance, he saw that the paper had no reference to the\r\naffairs of Peter Peebles; but the first glance also showed him, what,\r\neven at that time, and in that presence, he could not help reading; and\r\nwhich, being read, seemed totally to disconcert his ideas. He stopped\r\nshort in his harangue--gazed on the paper with a look of surprise and\r\nhorror-uttered an exclamation, and flinging down the brief which he had\r\nin his hand, hurried out of court without returning a single word of\r\nanswer to the various questions, \'What was the matter?\'--\'Was he taken\r\nunwell?\'--\'Should not a chair be called?\' &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Fairford, who remained seated, and looking as senseless as\r\nif he had been made of stone, was at length recalled to himself by the\r\nanxious inquiries of the judges and the counsel after his son\'s health.\r\nHe then rose with an air, in which was mingled the deep habitual\r\nreverence in which he held the court, with some internal cause of\r\nagitation, and with difficulty mentioned something of a mistake--a piece\r\nof bad news--Alan, he hoped would be well enough to-morrow. But unable\r\nto proceed further, he clasped his hands together, exclaiming, \'My son!\r\nmy son!\' and left the court hastily, as if in pursuit of him.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter with the auld bitch next?\' [Tradition ascribes this\r\nwhimsical style of language to the ingenious and philosophical Lord\r\nKaimes.] said an acute metaphysical judge, though somewhat coarse in\r\nhis manners, aside to his brethren. \'This is a daft cause,\r\nBladderskate--first, it drives the poor man mad that aught it--then your\r\nnevoy goes daft with fright, and flies the pit--then this smart young\r\nhopeful is aff the hooks with too hard study, I fancy--and now auld\r\nSaunders Fairford is as lunatic as the best of them. What say ye till\'t,\r\nye bitch?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing, my lord,\' answered Bladderskate, much too formal to admire the\r\nlevities in which his philosophical brother sometimes indulged--\'I say\r\nnothing, but pray to Heaven to keep our own wits.\'\r\n\r\n\'Amen, amen,\' answered his learned brother; \'for some of us have but few\r\nto spare.\'\r\n\r\nThe court then arose, and the audience departed, greatly wondering at\r\nthe talent displayed by Alan Fairford at his first appearance in a case\r\nso difficult and so complicated, and assigning a hundred conjectural\r\ncauses, each different from the others, for the singular interruption\r\nwhich had clouded his day of success. The worst of the whole was, that\r\nsix agents, who had each come to the separate resolution of thrusting a\r\nretaining fee into Alan\'s hand as he left the court, shook their heads\r\nas they returned the money into their leathern pouches, and said, \'that\r\nthe lad was clever, but they would like to see more of him before they\r\nengaged him in the way of business--they did not like his lowping away\r\nlike a flea in a blanket.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHad our friend Alexander Fairford known the consequences of his son\'s\r\nabrupt retreat from the court, which are mentioned in the end of the\r\nlast chapter, it might have accomplished the prediction of the lively\r\nold judge, and driven him utterly distracted. As it was, he was\r\nmiserable enough. His son had risen ten degrees higher in his estimation\r\nthan ever by his display of juridical talents, which seemed to assure\r\nhim that the applause of the judges and professors of the law, which, in\r\nhis estimation, was worth that of all mankind besides, authorized to\r\nthe fullest extent the advantageous estimate which even his parental\r\npartiality had been induced to form of Alan\'s powers. On the other hand,\r\nhe felt that he was himself a little humbled, from a disguise which he\r\nhad practised towards this son of his hopes and wishes.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that on the morning of this eventful day, Mr. Alexander\r\nFairford had received from his correspondent and friend, Provost Crosbie\r\nof Dumfries, a letter of the following tenor:\r\n\r\n\'DEAR SIR, \'Your respected favour of 25th ultimo, per favour of\r\nMr. Darsie Latimer, reached me in safety, and I showed to the young\r\ngentleman such attention as he was pleased to accept of. The object of\r\nmy present writing is twofold. First, the council are of opinion that\r\nyou should now begin to stir in the thirlage cause; and they think they\r\nwill be able, from evidence NOVITER REPERTUM, to enable you to amend\r\nyour condescendence upon the use and wont of the burgh, touching\r\nthe GRANA INVECTA ET ILLATA. So you will please consider yourself as\r\nauthorized to speak to Mr. Pest, and lay before him the papers which you\r\nwill receive by the coach. The council think that a fee of two guineas\r\nmay be sufficient on this occasion, as Mr. Pest had three for drawing\r\nthe original condescendence.\r\n\r\n\'I take the opportunity of adding that there has been a great riot among\r\nthe Solway fishermen, who have destroyed, in a masterful manner,\r\nthe stake-nets set up near the mouth of this river; and have besides\r\nattacked the house of Quaker Geddes, one of the principal partners of\r\nthe Tide-net Fishing Company, and done a great deal of damage. Am sorry\r\nto add, young Mr. Latimer was in the fray and has not since been heard\r\nof. Murder is spoke of, but that may be a word of course. As the young\r\ngentleman has behaved rather oddly while in these parts, as in declining\r\nto dine with me more than once, and going about the country with\r\nstrolling fiddlers and such-like, I rather hope that his present absence\r\nis only occasioned by a frolic; but as his servant has been making\r\ninquiries of me respecting his master, I thought it best to acquaint\r\nyou in course of post. I have only to add that our sheriff has taken\r\na precognition, and committed one or two of the rioters. If I can be\r\nuseful in this matter, either by advertising for Mr. Latimer as\r\nmissing, publishing a reward, or otherwise, I will obey your respected\r\ninstructions, being your most obedient to command, \'WILLIAM CROSBIE.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Fairford received this letter, and had read it to an end,\' his\r\nfirst idea was to communicate it to his son, that an express might be\r\ninstantly dispatched, or a king\'s messenger sent with proper authority\r\nto search after his late guest.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the fishers were rude; as he well knew, though not\r\nabsolutely sanguinary or ferocious; and there had been instances of\r\ntheir transporting persons who had interfered in their smuggling trade\r\nto the Isle of Man and elsewhere, and keeping them under restraint for\r\nmany weeks. On this account, Mr. Fairford was naturally led to\r\nfeel anxiety concerning the fate of his late inmate; and, at a less\r\ninteresting moment, would certainly have set out himself, or licensed\r\nhis son to go in pursuit of his friend.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! he was both a father and an agent. In the one capacity, he\r\nlooked on his son as dearer to him than all the world besides; in the\r\nother, the lawsuit which he conducted was to him like an infant to its\r\nnurse, and the case of Poor Peter Peebles against Plainstanes was, he\r\nsaw, adjourned, perhaps SINE DIE, should this document reach the hands\r\nof his son. The mutual and enthusiastical affection betwixt the young\r\nmen was well known to him; and he concluded that if the precarious state\r\nof Latimer were made known to Alan Fairford, it would render him not\r\nonly unwilling, but totally unfit, to discharge the duty of the day to\r\nwhich the old gentleman attached such ideas of importance.\r\n\r\nOn mature reflection, therefore, he resolved, though not without\r\nsome feelings of compunction, to delay communicating to his son the\r\ndisagreeable intelligence which he had received, until the business of\r\nthe day should be ended. The delay, he persuaded himself, could be of\r\nlittle consequence to Darsie Latimer, whose folly, he dared to say, had\r\nled him into some scrape which would meet an appropriate punishment in\r\nsome accidental restraint, which would be thus prolonged for only a few\r\nhours longer. Besides, he would have time to speak to the sheriff of the\r\ncounty--perhaps to the King\'s Advocate--and set about the matter in\r\na regular manner, or, as he termed it, as summing up the duties of\r\na solicitor, to AGE AS ACCORDS. [A Scots law phrase, of no very\r\ndeterminate import, meaning, generally, to do what is fitting.]\r\n\r\nThe scheme, as we have seen, was partially successful, and was only\r\nultimately defeated, as he confessed to himself with shame, by his own\r\nvery unbusiness-like mistake of shuffling the provost\'s letter, in the\r\nhurry and anxiety of the morning, among some papers belonging to Peter\r\nPeebles\'s affairs, and then handing it to his son, without observing\r\nthe blunder. He used to protest, even till the day of his death, that he\r\nnever had been guilty of such an inaccuracy as giving a paper out of his\r\nhand without looking at the docketing, except on that unhappy occasion,\r\nwhen, of all others, he had such particular reason to regret his\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\nDisturbed by these reflections, the old gentleman had, for the first\r\ntime in his life, some disinclination, arising from shame and vexation,\r\nto face his own son; so that to protract for a little the meeting,\r\nwhich he feared would be a painful one, he went to wait upon the\r\nsheriff-depute, who he found had set off for Dumfries in great haste to\r\nsuperintend in person the investigation which had been set on foot by\r\nhis substitute. This gentleman\'s clerk could say little on the subject\r\nof the riot, excepting that it had been serious, much damage done to\r\nproperty, and some personal violence offered to individuals; but, as far\r\nas he had yet heard, no lives lost on the spot.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairford was compelled to return home with this intelligence; and\r\non inquiring at James Wilkinson where his son was, received for answer,\r\nthat \'Maister Alan was in his own room, and very busy.\'\r\n\r\n\'We must have our explanation over,\' said Saunders Fairford to himself.\r\n\'Better a finger off, as ay wagging;\' and going to the door of his son\'s\r\napartment, he knocked at first gently--then more loudly--but received\r\nno answer. Somewhat alarmed at this silence, he opened the door of the\r\nchamber it was empty--clothes lay mixed in confusion with the law-books\r\nand papers, as if the inmate had been engaged in hastily packing for a\r\njourney. As Mr. Fairford looked around in alarm, his eye was arrested\r\nby a sealed letter lying upon his son\'s writing-table, and addressed to\r\nhimself. It contained the following words:--\r\n\r\n\'MY DEAREST FATHER, \'You will not, I trust, be surprised, nor perhaps\r\nvery much displeased, to learn that I am on my way to Dumfriesshire, to\r\nlearn, by my own personal investigation, the present state of my dear\r\nfriend, and afford him such relief as may be in my power, and which, I\r\ntrust, will be effectual. I do not presume to reflect upon you, dearest\r\nsir, for concealing from me information of so much consequence to my\r\npeace of mind and happiness; but I hope your having done so will be, if\r\nnot an excuse, at least some mitigation of my present offence, in taking\r\na step of consequence without consulting your pleasure; and, I must\r\nfurther own, under circumstances which perhaps might lead to your\r\ndisapprobation of my purpose. I can only say, in further apology, that\r\nif anything unhappy, which Heaven forbid! shall have occurred to the\r\nperson who, next to yourself, is dearest to me in this world, I shall\r\nhave on my heart, as a subject of eternal regret, that being in a\r\ncertain degree warned of his danger and furnished with the means\r\nof obviating it, I did not instantly hasten to his assistance, but\r\npreferred giving my attention to the business of this unlucky morning.\r\nNo view of personal distinction, nothing, indeed, short of your earnest\r\nand often expressed wishes, could have detained me in town till this\r\nday; and having made this sacrifice to filial duty, I trust you will\r\nhold me excused if I now obey the calls of friendship and humanity. Do\r\nnot be in the least anxious on my account; I shall know, I trust, how\r\nto conduct myself with due caution in any emergence which may occur,\r\notherwise my legal studies for so many years have been to little\r\npurpose. I am fully provided with money, and also with arms, in case of\r\nneed; but you may rely on my prudence in avoiding all occasions of using\r\nthe latter, short of the last necessity. God almighty bless you, my\r\ndearest father! and grant that you may forgive the first, and, I trust,\r\nthe last act approaching towards premeditated disobedience, of which I\r\neither have now, or shall hereafter have, to accuse myself. I remain,\r\ntill death, your dutiful and affectionate son, ALAN FAIRFORD.\'\r\n\r\n\'PS.--I shall write with the utmost regularity, acquainting you with my\r\nmotions, and requesting your advice. I trust my stay will be very short,\r\nand I think it possible that I may bring back Darsie along with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'The paper dropped from the old man\'s hand when he was thus assured\r\nof the misfortune which he apprehended. His first idea was to get a\r\npostchaise and pursue the fugitive; but he recollected that, upon the\r\nvery rare occasions when Alan had shown himself indocile to the PATRIA\r\nPOTESTAS, his natural ease and gentleness of disposition seemed hardened\r\ninto obstinacy, and that now, entitled, as arrived at the years of\r\nmajority and a member of the learned faculty, to direct his own motions,\r\nthere was great doubt, whether, in the event of his overtaking his son,\r\nhe might be able to prevail upon him to return back. In such a risk of\r\nfailure he thought it wiser to desist from his purpose, especially as\r\neven his success in such a pursuit would give a ridiculous ECLAT to the\r\nwhole affair, which could not be otherwise than prejudicial to his son\'s\r\nrising character.\r\n\r\nBitter, however, were Saunders Fairford\'s reflections, as again\r\npicking up the fatal scroll, he threw himself into his son\'s leathern\r\neasy-chair, and bestowed upon it a disjointed commentary, \'Bring back\r\nDarsie? little doubt of that--the bad shilling is sure enough to come\r\nback again. I wish Darsie no worse ill than that he were carried where\r\nthe silly fool, Alan, should never see him again. It was an ill hour\r\nthat he darkened my doors in, for, ever since that, Alan has given up\r\nhis ain old-fashioned mother-wit for the tother\'s capernoited maggots\r\nand nonsense. Provided with money? you must have more than I know of,\r\nthen, my friend, for I trow I kept you pretty short, for your own good.\r\nCan he have gotten more fees? or, does he think five guineas has neither\r\nbeginning nor end? Arms! What would he do with arms, or what would any\r\nman do with them that is not a regular soldier under government, or else\r\na thief-taker? I have had enough of arms, I trow, although I carried\r\nthem for King George and the government. But this is a worse strait than\r\nFalkirk field yet. God guide us, we are poor inconsistent creatures! To\r\nthink the lad should have made so able an appearance, and then bolted\r\noff this gate, after a glaiket ne\'er-do-weel, like a hound upon a false\r\nscent! Las-a-day! it\'s a sore thing to see a stunkard cow kick down\r\nthe pail when it\'s reaming fou. But, after all, it\'s an ill bird that\r\ndefiles its ain nest. I must cover up the scandal as well as I can.\r\nWhat\'s the matter now, James?\'\r\n\r\n\'A message, sir,\' said James Wilkinson, \'from my Lord President; and he\r\nhopes Mr. Alan is not seriously indisposed.\'\r\n\r\n\'From the Lord President? the Lord preserve us!--I\'ll send an answer\r\nthis instant; bid the lad sit down, and ask him to drink, James. Let me\r\nsee,\' continued he, taking a sheet of gilt paper \'how we are to draw our\r\nanswers.\'\r\n\r\nEre his pen had touched the paper, James was in the room again.\r\n\r\n\'What now, James?\'\r\n\r\n\'Lord Bladderskate\'s lad is come to ask how Mr. Alan is, as he left; the\r\ncourt\'--\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye, aye,\' answered Saunders, bitterly; \'he has e\'en made a\r\nmoonlight flitting, like my lord\'s ain nevoy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shall I say sae, sir?\' said James, who, as an old soldier, was literal\r\nin all things touching the service.\r\n\r\n\'The devil! no, no!--Bid the lad sit down and taste our ale. I will\r\nwrite his lordship an answer.\'\r\n\r\nOnce more the gilt paper was resumed, and once more the door was opened\r\nby James.\r\n\r\n\'Lord ------ sends his servitor to ask after Mr. Alan.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, the deevil take their civility!\' said poor Saunders, set him down\r\nto drink too--I will write to his lordship.\'\r\n\r\n\'The lads will bide your pleasure, sir, as lang as I keep the bicker\r\nfou; but this ringing is like to wear out the bell, I think; there are\r\nthey at it again.\'\r\n\r\nHe answered the fresh summons accordingly, and came back to inform Mr.\r\nFairford that the Dean of Faculty was below, inquiring for Mr. Alan.\r\n\'Will I set him down to drink, too?\' said James.\r\n\r\n\'Will you be an idiot, sir?\' said Mr. Fairford. \'Show Mr. Dean into the\r\nparlour.\'\r\n\r\nIn going slowly downstairs, step by step, the perplexed man of business\r\nhad time enough to reflect, that if it be possible to put a fair gloss\r\nupon a true story, the verity always serves the purpose better than any\r\nsubstitute which ingenuity can devise. He therefore told his learned\r\nvisitor, that although his son had been incommoded by the heat of the\r\ncourt, and the long train of hard study, by day and night, preceding\r\nhis exertions, yet he had fortunately so far recovered, as to be in\r\ncondition to obey upon the instant a sudden summons which had called him\r\nto the country, on a matter of life and death.\r\n\r\n\'It should be a serious matter indeed that takes my young friend away\r\nat this moment,\' said the good-natured dean. \'I wish he had stayed to\r\nfinish his pleading, and put down old Tough. Without compliment, Mr.\r\nFairford, it was as fine a first appearance as I ever heard. I should\r\nbe sorry your son did not follow it up in a reply. Nothing like striking\r\nwhile the iron is hot.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Saunders Fairford made a bitter grimace as he acquiesced in an\r\nopinion which was indeed decidedly his own; but he thought it most\r\nprudent to reply, \'that the affair which rendered his son Alan\'s\r\npresence in the country absolutely necessary, regarded the affairs of a\r\nyoung gentleman of great fortune, who was a particular friend of Alan\'s,\r\nand who never took any material step in his affairs without consulting\r\nhis counsel learned in the law.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, Mr. Fairford, you know best,\' answered the learned dean;\r\n\'if there be death or marriage in the case, a will or a wedding is to\r\nbe preferred to all other business. I am happy Mr. Alan is so much\r\nrecovered as to be able for travel, and wish you a very good morning.\'\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken his ground to the Dean of Faculty, Mr. Fairford\r\nhastily wrote cards in answer to the inquiry of the three judges,\r\naccounting for Alan\'s absence in the same manner. These, being properly\r\nsealed and addressed, he delivered to James with directions to dismiss\r\nthe particoloured gentry, who, in the meanwhile, had consumed a gallon\r\nof twopenny ale, while discussing points of law, and addressing each\r\nother by their masters\' titles. [The Scottish judges are distinguished\r\nby the title of lord prefixed to their own temporal designation. As\r\nthe ladies of these official dignitaries do not bear any share in their\r\nhusbands\' honours, they are distinguished only by their lords\' family\r\nname. They were not always contented with this species of Salique law,\r\nwhich certainly is somewhat inconsistent. But their pretensions to title\r\nare said to have been long since repelled by James V, the sovereign who\r\nfounded the College of Justice. \'I,\' said he, \'made the caries lords,\r\nbut who the devil made the carlines ladies?\']\r\n\r\nThe exertion which these matters demanded, and the interest which so\r\nmany persons of legal distinction appeared to have taken in his\r\nson, greatly relieved the oppressed spirit of Saunders Fairford, who\r\ncontinued, to talk mysteriously of the very important business which had\r\ninterfered with his son\'s attendance during the brief remainder of the\r\nsession. He endeavoured to lay the same unction to his own heart; but\r\nhere the application was less fortunate, for his conscience told him\r\nthat no end, however important, which could be achieved in Darsie\r\nLatimer\'s affairs, could be balanced against the reputation which Alan\r\nwas like to forfeit by deserting the cause of Poor Peter Peebles.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, although the haze which surrounded the cause, or\r\ncauses, of that unfortunate litigant had been for a time dispelled by\r\nAlan\'s eloquence, like a fog by the thunder of artillery, yet it seemed\r\nonce more to settle down upon the mass of litigation, thick as the\r\npalpable darkness of Egypt, at the very sound of Mr. Tough\'s voice, who,\r\non the second day after Alan\'s departure, was heard in answer to the\r\nopening counsel. Deep-mouthed, long-breathed, and pertinacious, taking\r\na pinch of snuff betwixt every sentence, which otherwise seemed\r\ninterminable--the veteran pleader prosed over all the themes which had\r\nbeen treated so luminously by Fairford: he quietly and imperceptibly\r\nreplaced all the rubbish which the other had cleared away, and succeeded\r\nin restoring the veil of obscurity and unintelligibility which had for\r\nmany years darkened the case of Peebles against Plainstanes; and\r\nthe matter was once more hung up by a remit to an accountant, with\r\ninstruction to report before answer. So different a result from that\r\nwhich the public had been led to expect from Alan\'s speech gave rise to\r\nvarious speculations.\r\n\r\nThe client himself opined, that it was entirely owing, first, to his\r\nown absence during the first day\'s pleading, being, as he said,\r\ndeboshed with brandy, usquebaugh, and other strong waters, at John\'s\r\nCoffee-house, PER AMBAGES of Peter Drudgeit, employed to that effect by\r\nand through the device, counsel, and covyne of Saunders Fairford,\r\nhis agent, or pretended agent. Secondly by the flight and voluntary\r\ndesertion of the younger Fairford, the advocate; on account of which, he\r\nserved both father and son with a petition and complaint against them,\r\nfor malversation in office. So that the apparent and most probable issue\r\nof this cause seemed to menace the melancholy Mr. Saunders Fairford,\r\nwith additional subject for plague and mortification; which was the more\r\ngalling, as his conscience told him that the case was really given away,\r\nand that a very brief resumption of the former argument, with reference\r\nto the necessary authorities and points of evidence, would have enabled\r\nAlan, by the mere breath, as it were, of his mouth, to blow away the\r\nvarious cobwebs with which Mr. Tough had again invested the proceedings.\r\nBut it went, he said, just like a decreet in absence, and was lost for\r\nwant of a contradictor.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, nearly a week passed over without Mr. Fairford hearing\r\na word directly from his son. He learned, indeed, by a letter from Mr.\r\nCrosbie, that the young counsellor had safely reached Dumfries, but had\r\nleft that town upon some ulterior researches, the purpose of which\r\nhe had not communicated. The old man, thus left to suspense, and to\r\nmortifying recollections, deprived also of the domestic society to which\r\nhe had been habituated, began to suffer in body as well as in mind. He\r\nhad formed the determination of setting out in person for Dumfriesshire,\r\nwhen, after having been dogged, peevish, and snappish to his clerks and\r\ndomestics, to an unusual and almost intolerable degree, the acrimonious\r\nhumours settled in a hissing-hot fit of the gout, which is a well-known\r\ntamer of the most froward spirits, and under whose discipline we shall,\r\nfor the present, leave him, as the continuation of this history assumes,\r\nwith the next division, a form somewhat different from direct narrative\r\nand epistolary correspondence, though partaking of the character of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nJOURNAL OF DARSIE LATIMER (The following address is written on the\r\ninside of the envelope which contained the Journal.)\r\n\r\nInto what hands soever these leaves may fall, they will instruct\r\nhim, during a certain time at least, in the history of the life of an\r\nunfortunate young man, who, in the heart of a free country, and without\r\nany crime being laid to his charge, has been, and is, subjected to a\r\ncourse of unlawful and violent restraint. He who opens this letter, is\r\ntherefore conjured to apply to the nearest magistrate, and, following\r\nsuch indications as the papers may afford, to exert himself for the\r\nrelief of one, who, while he possesses every claim to assistance\r\nwhich oppressed innocence can give, has, at the same time, both the\r\ninclination and the means of being grateful to his deliverers. Or, if\r\nthe person obtaining these letters shall want courage or means to effect\r\nthe writer\'s release, he is, in that case, conjured, by every duty of a\r\nman to his fellow mortals, and of a Christian towards one who professes\r\nthe same holy faith, to take the speediest measures for conveying them\r\nwith speed and safety to the hands of Alan Fairford, Esq., Advocate,\r\nresiding in the family of his father, Alexander Fairford, Esq., Writer\r\nto the Signet, Brown\'s Square, Edinburgh. He may be assured of a liberal\r\nreward, besides the consciousness of having discharged a real duty to\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST ALAN, Feeling as warmly towards you in doubt and in distress,\r\nas I ever did in the brightest days of our intimacy, it is to you whom\r\nI address a history which may perhaps fall into very different hands. A\r\nportion of my former spirit descends to my pen when I write your name,\r\nand indulging the happy thought that you may be my deliverer from my\r\npresent uncomfortable and alarming situation, as you have been my guide\r\nand counsellor on every former occasion, I will subdue the dejection\r\nwhich would otherwise overwhelm me. Therefore, as, Heaven knows, I have\r\ntime enough to write, I will endeavour to pour my thoughts out, as fully\r\nand freely as of old, though probably without the same gay and happy\r\nlevity.\r\n\r\nIf the papers should reach other hands than yours, still I will not\r\nregret this exposure of my feelings; for, allowing for an ample share of\r\nthe folly incidental to youth and inexperience, I fear not that I have\r\nmuch to be ashamed of in my narrative; nay, I even hope that the open\r\nsimplicity and frankness with which I am about to relate every singular\r\nand distressing circumstance, may prepossess even a stranger in my\r\nfavour; and that, amid the multitude of seemingly trivial circumstances\r\nwhich I detail at length, a clue may be found to effect my liberation.\r\n\r\nAnother chance certainly remains--the Journal, as I may call it,\r\nmay never reach the hands, either of the dear friend to whom it is\r\naddressed, or those of an indifferent stranger, but may become the prey\r\nof the persons by whom I am at present treated as a prisoner. Let it be\r\nso--they will learn from it little but what they already know; that,\r\nas a man and an Englishman, my soul revolts at the usage which I have\r\nreceived; that I am determined to essay every possible means to obtain\r\nmy freedom; that captivity has not broken my spirit, and that, although\r\nthey may doubtless complete their oppression by murder, I am still\r\nwilling to bequeath my cause to the justice of my country. Undeterred,\r\ntherefore, by the probability that my papers may be torn from me, and\r\nsubjected to the inspection of one in particular, who, causelessly\r\nmy enemy already, may be yet further incensed at me for recording the\r\nhistory of my wrongs, I proceed to resume the history of events which\r\nhave befallen me since the conclusion of my last letter to my dear Alan\r\nFairford, dated, if I mistake not, on the 5th day of this still current\r\nmonth of August.\r\n\r\nUpon the night preceding the date of that letter, I had been present,\r\nfor the purpose of an idle frolic, at a dancing party at the village of\r\nBrokenburn, about six miles from Dumfries; many persons must have seen\r\nme there, should the fact appear of importance sufficient to require\r\ninvestigation. I danced, played on the violin, and took part in the\r\nfestivity till about midnight, when my servant, Samuel Owen, brought me\r\nmy horses, and I rode back to a small inn called Shepherd\'s Bush, kept\r\nby Mrs. Gregson, which had been occasionally my residence for about a\r\nfortnight past. I spent the earlier part of the forenoon in writing a\r\nletter, which I have already mentioned, to you, my dear Alan, and which,\r\nI think, you must have received in safety. Why did I not follow your\r\nadvice, so often given me? Why did I linger in the neighbourhood of a\r\ndanger, of which a kind voice had warned me? These are now unavailing\r\nquestions; I was blinded by a fatality, and remained, fluttering like a\r\nmoth around the candle, until I have been scorched to some purpose.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the day had passed, and time hung heavy on my hands.\r\nI ought, perhaps, to blush at recollecting what has been often objected\r\nto me by the dear friend to whom this letter is addressed, viz. the\r\nfacility with which I have, in moments of indolence, suffered my motions\r\nto be, directed by any person who chanced to be near me, instead of\r\ntaking the labour of thinking or deciding for myself. I had employed for\r\nsome time, as a sort of guide and errand-boy, a lad named Benjamin, the\r\nson of one widow Coltherd, who lives near the Shepherd\'s Bush, and I\r\ncannot but remember that, upon several occasions, I had of late suffered\r\nhim to possess more influence over my motions than at all became the\r\ndifference of our age and condition. At present, he exerted himself to\r\npersuade me that it was the finest possible sport to see the fish taken\r\nout from the nets placed in the Solway at the reflux of the tide, and\r\nurged my going thither this evening so much, that, looking back on the\r\nwhole circumstances, I cannot but think he had some especial motive for\r\nhis conduct. These particulars I have mentioned, that if these papers\r\nfall into friendly hands, the boy may be sought after and submitted to\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nHis eloquence being unable to persuade me that I should take any\r\npleasure in seeing the fruitless struggles of the fish when left in the\r\nnets and deserted by the tide, he artfully suggested, that Mr. and Miss\r\nGeddes, a respectable Quaker family well known in the neighbourhood\r\nand with whom I had contracted habits of intimacy, would possibly be\r\noffended if I did not make them an early visit. Both, he said, had been\r\nparticularly inquiring the reasons of my leaving their house rather\r\nsuddenly on the previous day. I resolved, therefore, to walk up to Mount\r\nSharon and make my apologies; and I agreed to permit the boy to attend\r\nupon me, and wait my return from the house, that I might fish on my way\r\nhomeward to Shepherd\'s Bush, for which amusement, he assured me, I would\r\nfind the evening most favourable. I mention this minute circumstance,\r\nbecause I strongly suspect that this boy had a presentiment how the\r\nevening was to terminate with me, and entertained the selfish though\r\nchildish wish of securing to himself an angling-rod which he had often\r\nadmired, as a part of my spoils. I may do the boy wrong, but I had\r\nbefore remarked in him the peculiar art of pursuing the trifling objects\r\nof cupidity proper to his age, with the systematic address of much riper\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhen we had commenced our walk, I upbraided him with the coolness of\r\nthe evening, considering the season, the easterly wind, and other\r\ncircumstances, unfavourable for angling. He persisted in his own story,\r\nand made a few casts, as if to convince me of my error, but caught\r\nno fish; and, indeed, as I am now convinced, was much more intent on\r\nwatching my motions than on taking any. When I ridiculed him once more\r\non his fruitless endeavours, he answered with a sneering smile, that\r\n\'the trouts would not rise, because there was thunder in the air;\' an\r\nintimation which, in one sense, I have found too true.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Mount Sharon; was received by my friends there with their\r\nwonted kindness; and after being a little rallied on my having suddenly\r\nleft them on the preceding evening, I agreed to make atonement\r\nby staying all night, and dismissed the lad who attended with my\r\nfishing-rod, to carry that information to Shepherd\'s Bush. It may be\r\ndoubted whether he went thither, or in a different direction.\r\n\r\nBetwixt eight and nine o\'clock, when it began to become dark, we walked\r\non the terrace to enjoy the appearance of the firmament, glittering with\r\nten million stars; to which a slight touch of early frost gave tenfold\r\nlustre. As we gazed on this splendid scene, Miss Geddes, I think, was\r\nthe first to point out to our admiration a shooting or falling star,\r\nwhich, she said, drew a long train after it. Looking to the part of\r\nthe heavens which she pointed out, I distinctly observed two successive\r\nsky-rockets arise and burst in the sky.\r\n\r\n\'These meteors,\' said Mr. Geddes, in answer to his sister\'s observation,\r\n\'are not formed in heaven, nor do they bode any good to the dwellers\r\nupon earth.\'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, I looked to another quarter of the sky, and a rocket, as if\r\na signal in answer to those which had already appeared, rose high from\r\nthe earth, and burst apparently among the stars.\r\n\r\nMr. Geddes seemed very thoughtful for some minutes, and then said to\r\nhis sister, \'Rachel, though it waxes late. I must go down to the fishing\r\nstation, and pass the night in the overseer\'s room there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, then,\' replied the lady, \'I am but too well assured that the sons\r\nof Belial are menacing these nets and devices. Joshua, art thou a man of\r\npeace, and wilt thou willingly and wittingly thrust thyself where thou\r\nmayst be tempted by the old man Adam within thee, to enter into debate\r\nand strife?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am a man of peace, Rachel,\' answered Mr. Geddes, \'even to the utmost\r\nextent which our friends can demand of humanity; and neither have I ever\r\nused, nor, with the help of God, will I at any future time employ, the\r\narm of flesh to repel or to revenge injuries. But if I can, by mild\r\nreasons and firm conduct, save those rude men from committing a crime,\r\nand the property belonging to myself and others from sustaining damage,\r\nsurely I do but the duty of a man and a Christian.\'\r\n\r\nWith these words, he ordered his horse instantly; and his sister,\r\nceasing to argue with him, folded her arms upon her bosom, and looked up\r\nto heaven with a resigned and yet sorrowful countenance.\r\n\r\nThese particulars may appear trivial; but it is better, in my present\r\ncondition, to exert my faculties in recollecting the past, and in\r\nrecording it, than waste them in vain and anxious anticipations of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIt would have been scarcely proper in me to remain in the house from\r\nwhich the master was thus suddenly summoned away; and I therefore begged\r\npermission to attend him to the fishing station, assuring his sister\r\nthat I would be a guarantee for his safety.\r\n\r\nThat proposal seemed to give much pleasure to Miss Geddes. \'Let it be\r\nso, brother,\' she said; \'and let the young man have the desire of his\r\nheart, that there may be a faithful witness to stand by thee in the hour\r\nof need, and to report how it shall fare with thee.\r\n\r\n\'Nay, Rachel,\' said the worthy man, \'thou art to blame in this, that\r\nto quiet thy apprehensions on my account, thou shouldst thrust into\r\ndanger--if danger it shall prove to be--this youth, our guest; for\r\nwhom, doubtless, in case of mishap, as many hearts will ache as may be\r\nafflicted on our account.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, my good friend,\' said I, taking Mr. Geddes\'s hand, \'I am not so\r\nhappy as you suppose me. Were my span to be concluded this evening, few\r\nwould so much as know that such a being had existed for twenty years on\r\nthe face of the earth; and of these few, only one would sincerely regret\r\nme. Do not, therefore, refuse me the privilege attending you; and of\r\nshowing, by so trifling an act of kindness, that if I have few friends,\r\nI am at least desirous to serve them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thou hast a kind heart, I warrant thee,\' said Joshua Geddes, returning\r\nthe pressure of my hand. \'Rachel, the young man shall go with me. Why\r\nshould he not face danger, in order to do justice and preserve peace?\r\nThere is that within me,\' he added, looking upwards, and with a passing\r\nenthusiasm which I had not before observed and the absence of\r\nwhich perhaps rather belonged to the sect than to his own personal\r\ncharacter--\'I say, I have that within which assures me, that though the\r\nungodly may rage even like the storm of the ocean, they shall not have\r\nfreedom to prevail against us.\'\r\n\r\nHaving spoken thus, Mr. Geddes appointed a pony to be saddled for my\r\nuse; and having taken a basket with some provisions, and a servant\r\nto carry back the horses for which there was no accommodation at the\r\nfishing station, we set off about nine o\'clock at night, and after\r\nthree-quarters of an hour\'s riding, arrived at our place of destination.\r\n\r\nThe station consists, or then consisted, of huts for four or five\r\nfishermen, a cooperage and shed, and a better sort of cottage at which\r\nthe superintendent resided. We gave our horses to the servant, to be\r\ncarried back to Mount Sharon; my companion expressing himself humanely\r\nanxious for their safety--and knocked at the door of the house. At\r\nfirst we only heard a barking of dogs; but these animals became quiet on\r\nsnuffing beneath the door, and acknowledging the presence of friends. A\r\nhoarse voice then demanded, in rather unfriendly accents, who we were,\r\nand what we wanted and it was not; until Joshua named himself, and\r\ncalled upon his superintendent to open, that the latter appeared at the\r\ndoor of the hut, attended by three large dogs of the Newfoundland breed.\r\nHe had a flambeau in his hand, and two large heavy ship-pistols stuck\r\ninto his belt. He was a stout elderly man, who had been a sailor, as I\r\nlearned, during the earlier part of his life, and was now much confided\r\nin by the Fishing Company, whose concerns he directed under the orders\r\nof Mr. Geddes.\r\n\r\n\'Thou didst not expect me to-night, friend Davies?\' said my friend to\r\nthe old man, who was arranging seats for us by the fire.\r\n\r\n\'No, Master Geddes,\' answered he, \'I did not expect you, nor, to speak\r\nthe truth, did I wish for you either.\'\r\n\r\n\'These are plain terms: John Davies,\' answered Mr. Geddes.\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye, sir, I know your worship loves no holiday speeches.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thou dost guess, I suppose, what brings us here so late, John Davies?\'\r\nsaid Mr. Geddes.\r\n\r\n\'I do suppose, sir,\' answered the superintendent, \'that it was because\r\nthose d--d smuggling wreckers on the coast are showing their lights to\r\ngather their forces, as they did the night before they broke down the\r\ndam-dyke and weirs up the country; but if that same be the case, I wish\r\nonce more you had stayed away, for your worship carries no fighting\r\ntackle aboard, I think; and there will be work for such ere morning,\r\nyour worship.\'\r\n\r\n\'Worship is due to Heaven only, John Davies,\' said Geddes, \'I have often\r\ndesired thee to desist from using that phrase to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t, then,\' said John; \'no offence meant: But how the devil can a\r\nman stand picking his words, when he is just going to come to blows?\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope not, John Davies,\' said Joshua Geddes. \'Call in the rest of the\r\nmen, that I may give them their instructions.\'\r\n\r\n\'I may cry till doomsday Master Geddes, ere a soul answers--the cowardly\r\nlubbers have all made sail--the cooper, and all the rest of them, so\r\nsoon as they heard the enemy were at sea. They have all taken to the\r\nlong-boat, and left the ship among the breakers, except little Phil and\r\nmyself--they have, by--!\'\r\n\r\n\'Swear not at all, John Davies--thou art an honest man; and I believe,\r\nwithout an oath, that thy comrades love their own bones better than\r\nmy goods and chattels. And so thou hast no assistance but little Phil\r\nagainst a hundred men or two?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, there are the dogs, your honour knows, Neptune and Thetis--and\r\nthe puppy may do something; and then though your worship--I beg\r\npardon--though your honour be no great fighter, this young gentleman may\r\nbear a hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, and I see you are provided with arms,\' said Mr. Geddes; \'let me\r\nsee them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye, sir; here be a pair of buffers will bite as well as\r\nbark--these will make sure of two rogues at least. It would be a shame\r\nto strike without firing a shot. Take care, your honour, they are\r\ndouble-shotted.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, John Davies, I will take care of them, throwing the pistols into a\r\ntub of water beside him; \'and I wish I could render the whole generation\r\nof them useless at the same moment.\'\r\n\r\nA deep shade of displeasure passed over John Davies\'s weatherbeaten\r\ncountenance. \'Belike your honour is going to take the command yourself,\r\nthen?\' he said, after a pause. \'Why, I can be of little use now; and\r\nsince your worship, or your honour, or whatever you are, means to strike\r\nquietly, I believe you will do it better without me than with me, for I\r\nam like enough to make mischief, I admit; but I\'ll never leave my post\r\nwithout orders.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you have mine, John Davies, to go to Mount Sharon directly, and\r\ntake the boy Phil with you. Where is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'He is on the outlook for these scums of the earth,\' answered Davies;\r\n\'but it is to no purpose to know when they come, if we are not to stand\r\nto our weapons.\'\r\n\r\n\'We will use none but those of sense and reason, John.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you may just as well cast chaff against the wind, as speak sense\r\nand reason to the like of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, be it so,\' said Joshua; \'and now, John Davies, I know thou\r\nart what the world calls a brave fellow, and I have ever found thee an\r\nhonest one. And now I command you to go to Mount Sharon, and let Phil\r\nlie on the bank-side--see the poor boy hath a sea-cloak, though--and\r\nwatch what happens there, and let him bring you the news; and if\r\nany violence shall be offered to the property there, I trust to your\r\nfidelity to carry my sister to Dumfries to the house of our friends\r\nthe Corsacks, and inform the civil authorities of what mischief hath\r\nbefallen.\'\r\n\r\nThe old seaman paused a moment. \'It is hard lines for me,\' he said, \'to\r\nleave your honour in tribulation; and yet, staying here, I am only like\r\nto make bad worse; and your honour\'s sister, Miss Rachel, must be looked\r\nto, that\'s certain; for if the rogues once get their hand to mischief,\r\nthey will come to Mount Sharon after they have wasted and destroyed this\r\nhere snug little roadstead, where I thought to ride at anchor for life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right, right, John Davies,\' said Joshua Geddes; \'and best call the dogs\r\nwith you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye, sir,\' said the veteran, \'for they are something of my mind,\r\nand would not keep quiet if they saw mischief doing; so maybe they might\r\ncome to mischief, poor dumb creatures. So God bless your honour--I\r\nmean your worship--I cannot bring my mouth to say fare you well. Here,\r\nNeptune, Thetis! come, dogs, come.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, and with a very crestfallen countenance, John Davies left the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n\'Now there goes one of the best and most faithful creatures that ever\r\nwas born,\' said Mr. Geddes, as the superintendent shut the door of the\r\ncottage. \'Nature made him with a heart that would not have suffered him\r\nto harm a fly; but thou seest, friend Latimer, that as men arm their\r\nbull-dogs with spiked collars, and their game-cocks with steel spurs, to\r\naid them in fight, so they corrupt, by education, the best and mildest\r\nnatures, until fortitude and spirit become stubbornness and ferocity.\r\nBelieve me, friend Latimer, I would as soon expose my faithful household\r\ndog to a vain combat with a herd of wolves, as yon trusty creature to\r\nthe violence of the enraged multitude. But I need say little on this\r\nsubject to thee, friend Latimer, who, I doubt not, art trained to\r\nbelieve that courage is displayed and honour attained, not by doing\r\nand suffering as becomes a man that which fate calls us to suffer and\r\njustice commands us to do, but because thou art ready to retort violence\r\nfor violence, and considerest the lightest insult as a sufficient cause\r\nfor the spilling of blood, nay, the taking of life. But, leaving these\r\npoints of controversy to a more fit season, let us see what our basket\r\nof provision contains; for in truth, friend Latimer, I am one of those\r\nwhom neither fear nor anxiety deprives of their ordinary appetite.\'\r\n\r\nWe found the means of good cheer accordingly, which Mr. Geddes seemed to\r\nenjoy as much as if it had been eaten in a situation of perfect safety;\r\nnay, his conversation appeared to be rather more gay than on ordinary\r\noccasions. After eating our supper, we left the hut together, and walked\r\nfor a few minutes on the banks of the sea. It was high water, and the\r\nebb had not yet commenced. The moon shone broad and bright upon the\r\nplacid face of the Solway Firth, and showed a slight ripple upon the\r\nstakes, the tops of which were just visible above the waves, and on\r\nthe dark-coloured buoys which marked the upper edge of the enclosure of\r\nnets. At a much greater distance--for the estuary is here very wide--the\r\nline of the English coast was seen on the verge of the water, resembling\r\none of those fog-banks on which mariners are said to gaze, uncertain\r\nwhether it be land or atmospherical delusion.\r\n\r\n\'We shall be undisturbed for some hours,\' said Mr. Geddes; \'they will\r\nnot come down upon us: till the state of the tide permits them to\r\ndestroy the tide-nets. Is it not strange to think that human passions\r\nwill so soon transform such a tranquil scene as this into one of\r\ndevastation and confusion?\'\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a scene of exquisite stillness; so much so, that the\r\nrestless waves of the Solway seemed, if not absolutely to sleep, at\r\nleast to slumber; on the shore no night-bird was heard--the cock had not\r\nsung his first matins, and we ourselves walked more lightly than by day,\r\nas if to suit the sounds of our own paces to the serene tranquillity\r\naround us. At length, the plaintive cry of a dog broke the silence, and\r\non our return to the cottage, we found that the younger of the three\r\nanimals which had gone along with John Davies, unaccustomed, perhaps,\r\nto distant journeys, and the duty of following to heel, had strayed from\r\nthe party, and, unable to rejoin them, had wandered back to the place of\r\nits birth.\r\n\r\n\'Another feeble addition to our feeble garrison,\' said Mr. Geddes, as he\r\ncaressed the dog, and admitted it into the cottage. \'Poor thing! as thou\r\nart incapable of doing any mischief, I hope thou wilt sustain none. At\r\nleast thou mayst do us the good service of a sentinel, and permit us to\r\nenjoy a quiet repose, under the certainty that thou wilt alarm us when\r\nthe enemy is at hand.\'\r\n\r\nThere were two beds in the superintendent\'s room, upon which we threw\r\nourselves. Mr. Geddes, with his happy equanimity of temper, was asleep\r\nin the first five minutes. I lay for some time in doubtful and anxious\r\nthoughts, watching the fire, and the motions of the restless dog, which,\r\ndisturbed probably at the absence of John Davies, wandered from the\r\nhearth to the door and back again, then came to the bedside and licked\r\nmy hands and face, and at length, experiencing no repulse to its\r\nadvances, established itself at my feet, and went to sleep, an example\r\nwhich I soon afterwards followed.\r\n\r\nThe rage of narration, my dear Alan--for I will never relinquish the\r\nhope that what I am writing may one day reach your hands--has\r\nnot forsaken me, even in my confinement, and the extensive though\r\nunimportant details into which I have been hurried, renders it necessary\r\nthat I commence another sheet. Fortunately, my pygmy characters\r\ncomprehend a great many words within a small space of paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDARSIE LATIMER\'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION\r\n\r\nThe morning was dawning, and Mr. Geddes and I myself were still sleeping\r\nsoundly, when the alarm was given by my canine bedfellow, who first\r\ngrowled deeply at intervals, and at length bore more decided testimony\r\nto the approach of some enemy. I opened the door of the cottage, and\r\nperceived, at the distance of about two hundred yards, a small but close\r\ncolumn of men, which I would have taken for a dark hedge, but that I\r\ncould perceive it was advancing rapidly and in silence.\r\n\r\nThe dog flew towards them, but instantly ran howling back to me, having\r\nprobably been chastised by a stick or a stone. Uncertain as to the plan\r\nof tactics or of treaty which Mr. Geddes might think proper to adopt, I\r\nwas about to retire into the cottage, when he suddenly joined me at the\r\ndoor, and, slipping his arm through mine, said, \'Let us go to meet them\r\nmanfully; we have done nothing to be ashamed of.--Friends,\' he said,\r\nraising his voice as we approached them, \'who and what are you, and with\r\nwhat purpose are you here on my property?\'\r\n\r\nA loud cheer was the answer returned, and a brace of fiddlers who\r\noccupied the front of the march immediately struck up the insulting air,\r\nthe words of which begin--\r\n\r\n  Merrily danced the Quaker\'s wife,\r\n  And merrily danced the Quaker.\r\n\r\nEven at that moment of alarm, I think I recognized the tones of the\r\nblind fiddler, Will, known by the name of Wandering Willie, from his\r\nitinerant habits. They continued to advance swiftly and in great order,\r\nin their front\r\n\r\n  The fiery fiddlers playing martial airs;\r\n\r\nwhen, coming close up, they surrounded us by a single movement, and\r\nthere was a universal cry, \'Whoop, Quaker--whoop, Quaker! Here have we\r\nthem both, the wet Quaker and the dry one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hang up the wet Quaker to dry, and wet the dry one with a ducking,\'\r\nanswered another voice.\r\n\r\n\'Where is the sea-otter, John Davies, that destroyed more fish than any\r\nsealch upon Ailsa Craig?\' exclaimed a third voice. \'I have an old crow\r\nto pluck with him, and a pock to put the feathers in.\'\r\n\r\nWe stood perfectly passive; for, to have attempted resistance against\r\nmore than a hundred men, armed with guns, fish-spears, iron-crows,\r\nspades, and bludgeons, would have been an act of utter insanity. Mr.\r\nGeddes, with his strong sonorous voice, answered the question about the\r\nsuperintendent in a manner the manly indifference of which compelled\r\nthem to attend to him.\r\n\r\n\'John Davies,\' he said, \'will, I trust, soon be at Dumfries\'--\r\n\r\n\'To fetch down redcoats and dragoons against us, you canting old\r\nvillain!\'\r\n\r\nA blow was, at the same time, levelled at my friend, which I parried by\r\ninterposing the stick I had in my hand. I was instantly struck down, and\r\nhave a faint recollection of hearing some crying, \'Kill the young spy!\'\r\nand others, as I thought, interposing on my behalf. But a second blow\r\non the head, received in the scuffle, soon deprived me of sense and\r\nconsciousness, and threw me into it state of insensibility, from which\r\nI did not recover immediately. When I did come to myself, I was lying\r\non the bed from which I had just risen before the fray, and my poor\r\ncompanion, the Newfoundland puppy, its courage entirely cowed by the\r\ntumult of the riot, had crept as close to me as it could, and lay\r\ntrembling and whining, as if under the most dreadful terror. I doubted\r\nat first whether I had not dreamed of the tumult, until, as I attempted\r\nto rise, a feeling of pain and dizziness assured me that the injury\r\nI had sustained was but too real. I gathered together my senses\r\nlistened--and heard at a distance the shouts of the rioters, busy,\r\ndoubtless, in their work of devastation. I made a second effort to rise,\r\nor at least to turn myself, for I lay with my face to the wall of\r\nthe cottage, but I found that my limbs were secured, and my motions\r\neffectually prevented--not indeed by cords, but by linen or cloth\r\nbandages swathed around my ankles, and securing my arms to my sides.\r\nAware of my utterly captive condition, I groaned betwixt bodily pain and\r\nmental distress,\r\n\r\nA voice by my bedside whispered, in a whining tone, \'Whisht a-ye,\r\nhinnie--Whisht a-ye; haud your tongue, like a gude bairn--ye have cost\r\nus dear aneugh already. My hinnie\'s clean gane now.\'\r\n\r\nKnowing, as I thought, the phraseology of the wife of the itinerant\r\nmusician, I asked her where her husband was, and whether he had been\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\n\'Broken,\' answered the dame, \'all broken to pieces; fit for naught but\r\nto be made spunks of--the best blood that was in Scotland.\'\r\n\r\n\'Broken?--blood?--is your husband wounded; has there been bloodshed\r\nbroken limbs?\'\r\n\r\n\'Broken limbs I wish,\' answered the beldam, \'that my hinnie had broken\r\nthe best bane in his body, before he had broken his fiddle, that was the\r\nbest blood in Scotland--it was a Cremony, for aught that I ken.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pshaw--only his fiddle?\' said I.\r\n\r\n\'I dinna ken what waur your honour could have wished him to do, unless\r\nhe had broken his neck; and this is muckle the same to my hinnie Willie\r\nand me. Chaw, indeed! It is easy to say chaw, but wha is to gie us ony\r\nthing to chaw?--the bread-winner\'s gane, and we may e\'en sit down and\r\nstarve.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' I said, \'I will pay you for twenty such fiddles.\'\r\n\r\n\'Twenty such! is that a\' ye ken about it? the country hadna the like\r\no\'t. But if your honour were to pay us, as nae doubt wad be to your\r\ncredit here and hereafter, where are ye to get the siller?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have enough of money,\' said I, attempting to reach my hand towards my\r\nside-pocket; \'unloose these bandages, and I will pay you on the spot.\'\r\n\r\nThis hint appeared to move her, and she was approaching the bedside, as\r\nI hoped, to liberate me from my bonds, when a nearer and more desperate\r\nshout was heard, as if the rioters were close by the hut.\r\n\r\n\'I daurna I daurna,\' said the poor woman, \'they would murder me and my\r\nhinnie Willie baith, and they have misguided us aneugh already;--but if\r\nthere is anything worldly I could do for your honour, leave out loosing\r\nye?\'\r\n\r\nWhat she said recalled me to my bodily suffering. Agitation, and the\r\neffects of the usage I had received, had produced a burning thirst. I\r\nasked for a drink of water.\r\n\r\n\'Heaven Almighty forbid that Epps Ainslie should gie ony sick gentleman\r\ncauld well-water, and him in a fever. Na, na, hinnie, let me alane, I\'ll\r\ndo better for ye than the like of that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Give me what you will,\' I replied; \'let it but be liquid and cool.\'\r\n\r\nThe woman gave me a large horn accordingly, filled with spirits and\r\nwater, which, without minute inquiry concerning the nature of its\r\ncontents, I drained at a draught. Either the spirits taken in such a\r\nmanner acted more suddenly than usual on my brain, or else there was\r\nsome drug mixed with the beverage. I remember little after drinking it\r\noff, only that the appearance of things around me became indistinct;\r\nthat the woman\'s form seemed to multiply itself, and to flit in various\r\nfigures around me, bearing the same lineaments as she herself did. I\r\nremember also that the discordant noises and cries of those without the\r\ncottage seemed to die away in a hum like that with which a nurse hushes\r\nher babe. At length I fell into a deep sound sleep, or rather, a state\r\nof absolute insensibility.\r\n\r\nI have reason to think this species of trance lasted for many hours;\r\nindeed, for the whole subsequent day and part of the night. It was not\r\nuniformly so profound, for my recollection of it is chequered with many\r\ndreams, all of a painful nature, but too faint and too indistinct to be\r\nremembered. At length the moment of waking came, and my sensations were\r\nhorrible.\r\n\r\nA deep sound, which, in the confusion of my senses, I identified with\r\nthe cries of the rioters, was the first thing of which I was sensible;\r\nnext, I became conscious that I was carried violently forward in some\r\nconveyance, with an unequal motion, which gave me much pain. My position\r\nwas horizontal, and when I attempted to stretch my hands in order to\r\nfind some mode of securing myself against this species of suffering, I\r\nfound I was bound as before, and the horrible reality rushed on my\r\nmind that I was in the hands of those who had lately committed a great\r\noutrage on property, and were now about to kidnap, if not to murder me.\r\nI opened my eyes, it was to no purpose--all around me was dark, for\r\na day had passed over during my captivity. A dispiriting sickness\r\noppressed my head--my heart seemed on fire, while my feet and hands were\r\nchilled and benumbed with want of circulation. It was with the utmost\r\ndifficulty that I at length, and gradually, recovered in a sufficient\r\ndegree the power of observing external sounds and circumstances; and\r\nwhen I did so, they presented nothing consolatory.\r\n\r\nGroping with my hands, as far as the bandages would permit, and\r\nreceiving the assistance of some occasional glances of the moonlight, I\r\nbecame aware that the carriage in which I was transported was one of the\r\nlight carts of the country, called TUMBLERS, and that a little attention\r\nhad been paid to my accommodation, as I was laid upon some sacks covered\r\nwith matting, and filled with straw. Without these, my condition would\r\nhave been still more intolerable, for the vehicle, sinking now on one\r\nside, and now on the other, sometimes sticking absolutely fast and\r\nrequiring the utmost exertions of the animal which drew it to put it\r\nonce more in motion, was subjected to jolts in all directions, which\r\nwere very severe. At other times it rolled silently and smoothly over\r\nwhat seemed to be wet sand; and, as I heard the distant roar of the\r\ntide, I had little doubt that we were engaged in passing the formidable\r\nestuary which divides the two kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be at least five or six people about the cart, some on\r\nfoot, others on horseback; the former lent assistance whenever it was in\r\ndanger of upsetting, or sticking fast in the quicksand; the others rode\r\nbefore and acted as guides, often changing the direction of the vehicle\r\nas the precarious state of the passage required.\r\n\r\nI addressed myself to the men around the cart, and endeavoured to move\r\ntheir compassion. I had harmed, I said, no one, and for no action in my\r\nlife had deserved such cruel treatment, I had no concern whatever in\r\nthe fishing station which had incurred their displeasure, and my\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Geddes was of a very late date. Lastly, and as my\r\nstrongest argument, I endeavoured to excite their fears, by informing\r\nthem that my rank in life would not permit me to be either murdered or\r\nsecreted with impunity; and to interest their avarice, by the promises\r\nI made them of reward, if they would effect my deliverance. I only\r\nreceived a scornful laugh in reply to my threats; my promises might have\r\ndone more, for the fellows were whispering together as if in hesitation,\r\nand I began to reiterate and increase my offers, when the voice of one\r\nof the horsemen, who had suddenly come up, enjoined silence to the\r\nmen on foot, and, approaching the side of the cart, said to me, with\r\na strong and determined voice, \'Young man, there is no personal harm\r\ndesigned to you. If you remain silent and quiet, you may reckon on\r\ngood treatment; but if you endeavour to tamper with these men in the\r\nexecution of their duty, I will take such measures for silencing you, as\r\nyou shall remember the longest day you have to live.\'\r\n\r\nI thought I knew the voice which uttered these threats; but, in such\r\na situation, my perceptions could not be supposed to be perfectly\r\naccurate. I was contented to reply, \'Whoever you are that speak to me, I\r\nentreat the benefit of the meanest prisoner, who is not to be subjected,\r\nlegally to greater hardship than is necessary for the restraint of his\r\nperson. I entreat that these bonds, which hurt me so cruelly, may be\r\nslackened at least, if not removed altogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will slacken the belts,\' said the former speaker; \'nay, I will\r\naltogether remove them, and allow you to pursue your journey in a more\r\nconvenient manner, provided you will give me your word of honour that\r\nyou will not attempt an escape?\'\r\n\r\n\'NEVER!\' I answered, with an energy of which despair alone could have\r\nrendered me capable--\'I will never submit to loss of freedom a moment\r\nlonger than I am subjected to it by force.\'\r\n\r\n\'Enough,\' he replied; \'the sentiment is natural; but do not on your side\r\ncomplain that I, who am carrying on an important undertaking, use the\r\nonly means in my power for ensuring its success.\'\r\n\r\nI entreated to know what it was designed to do with me; but my\r\nconductor, in a voice of menacing authority, desired me to be silent on\r\nmy peril; and my strength and spirits were too much exhausted to permit\r\nmy continuing a dialogue so singular, even if I could have promised\r\nmyself any good result by doing so.\r\n\r\nIt is proper here to add, that, from my recollections at the time, and\r\nfrom what has since taken place, I have the strongest possible belief\r\nthat the man with whom I held this expostulation was the singular person\r\nresiding at Brokenburn, in Dumfriesshire, and called by the fishers of\r\nthat hamlet, the Laird of the Solway Lochs. The cause for his inveterate\r\npersecution I cannot pretend even to guess at.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the cart was dragged heavily and wearily on, until the\r\nnearer roar of the advancing tide excited the apprehension of another\r\ndanger. I could not mistake the sound, which I had heard upon another\r\noccasion, when it was only the speed of a fleet horse which saved me\r\nfrom perishing in the quicksands. Thou, my dear Alan, canst not but\r\nremember the former circumstances; and now, wonderful contrast! the very\r\nman, to the best of my belief, who then saved me from peril, was\r\nthe leader of the lawless band who had deprived me of my liberty. I\r\nconjectured that the danger grew imminent; for I heard some words and\r\ncircumstances which made me aware that a rider hastily fastened his own\r\nhorse to the shafts of the cart in order to assist the exhausted animal\r\nwhich drew it, and the vehicle was now pulled forward at a faster pace,\r\nwhich the horses were urged to maintain by blows and curses. The\r\nmen, however, were inhabitants of the neighbourhood; and I had strong\r\npersonal reason to believe that one of them, at least, was intimately\r\nacquainted with all the depths and shallows of the perilous paths in\r\nwhich we were engaged. But they were in imminent danger themselves; and\r\nif so, as from the whispering and exertions to push on with the cart\r\nwas much to be apprehended, there was little doubt that I should be left\r\nbehind as a useless encumbrance, and that, while I was in a condition\r\nwhich rendered every chance of escape impracticable. These were awful\r\napprehensions; but it pleased Providence to increase them to a point\r\nwhich my brain was scarcely able to endure.\r\n\r\nAs we approached very near to a black line, which, dimly visible as it\r\nwas, I could make out to be the shore, we heard two or three sounds,\r\nwhich appeared to be the report of fire-arms. Immediately all was bustle\r\namong our party to get forward. Presently a fellow galloped up to us,\r\ncrying out, \'Ware hawk! ware hawk! the land-sharks are out from Burgh,\r\nand Allonby Tom will lose his cargo if you do not bear a hand.\'\r\n\r\nMost of my company seemed to make hastily for the shore on receiving\r\nthis intelligence. A driver was left with the cart; but at length, when,\r\nafter repeated and hairbreadth escapes, it actually stuck fast in a\r\nslough or quicksand, the fellow, with an oath, cut the harness, and, as\r\nI presume, departed with the horses, whose feet I heard splashing over\r\nthe wet sand and through the shallows, as he galloped off.\r\n\r\nThe dropping sound of fire-arms was still continued, but lost almost\r\nentirely in the thunder of the advancing surge. By a desperate effort I\r\nraised myself in the cart, and attained a sitting posture, which served\r\nonly to show me the extent of my danger. There lay my native land--my\r\nown England--the land where I was born, and to which my wishes, since\r\nmy earliest age, had turned with all the prejudices of national\r\nfeeling--there it lay, within a furlong of the place where I yet was;\r\nthat furlong, which an infant would have raced over in a minute, was yet\r\na barrier effectual to divide me for ever from England and from life. I\r\nsoon not only heard the roar of this dreadful torrent, but saw, by\r\nthe fitful moonlight, the foamy crests of the devouring waves, as they\r\nadvanced with the speed and fury of a pack of hungry wolves.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness that the slightest ray of hope, or power of\r\nstruggling, was not left me, quite overcame the constancy which I had\r\nhitherto maintained. My eyes began to swim--my head grew giddy and mad\r\nwith fear--I chattered and howled to the howling and roaring sea. One\r\nor two great waves already reached the cart, when the conductor of the\r\nparty whom I have mentioned so often, was, as if by magic, at my side.\r\nHe sprang from his horse into the vehicle, cut the ligatures which\r\nrestrained me, and bade me get up and mount in the fiend\'s name.\r\n\r\nSeeing I was incapable of obeying, he seized me as if I had been a\r\nchild of six months old, threw me across the horse, sprang on behind,\r\nsupporting with one hand, while he directed the animal with the other.\r\nIn my helpless and painful posture, I was unconscious of the degree\r\nof danger which we incurred; but I believe at one time the horse was\r\nswimming, or nearly so; and that it was with difficulty that my stern\r\nand powerful assistant kept my head above water. I remember particularly\r\nthe shock which I felt when the animal, endeavouring to gain the bank,\r\nreared, and very nearly fell back on his burden. The time during which\r\nI continued in this dreadful condition did not probably exceed two or\r\nthree minutes, yet so strongly were they marked with horror and agony,\r\nthat they seem to my recollection a much more considerable space of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been thus snatched from destruction, I had only power to say\r\nto my protector,--or oppressor,--for he merited either name at my hand,\r\n\'You do not, then, design to murder me?\'\r\n\r\nHe laughed as he replied, but it was a sort of laughter which I scarce\r\ndesire to hear again,--\'Else you think I had let the waves do the work?\r\nBut remember, the shepherd saves his sheep from the torrent--is it to\r\npreserve its life?--Be silent, however, with questions or entreaties.\r\nWhat I mean to do, thou canst no more discover or prevent, than a man,\r\nwith his bare palm, can scoop dry the Solway.\'\r\n\r\nI was too much exhausted to continue the argument; and, still numbed and\r\ntorpid in all my limbs, permitted myself without reluctance to be placed\r\non a horse brought for the purpose. My formidable conductor rode on the\r\none side, and another person on the other, keeping me upright in the\r\nsaddle. In this manner we travelled forward at a considerable rate,\r\nand by by-roads, with which my attendant seemed as familiar as with the\r\nperilous passages of the Solway.\r\n\r\nAt length, after stumbling through a labyrinth of dark and deep lanes,\r\nand crossing more than one rough and barren heath, we found ourselves on\r\nthe edge of a highroad, where a chaise and four awaited, as it appeared,\r\nour arrival. To my great relief, we now changed our mode of conveyance;\r\nfor my dizziness and headache had returned in so strong a degree, that I\r\nshould otherwise have been totally unable to keep my seat on horseback,\r\neven with the support which I received.\r\n\r\nMy doubted and dangerous companion signed to me to enter the\r\ncarriage--the man who had ridden on the left side of my horse stepped in\r\nafter me, and drawing up the blinds of the vehicle, gave the signal for\r\ninstant departure.\r\n\r\nI had obtained a glimpse of the countenance of my new companion, as by\r\nthe aid of a dark lantern the drivers opened the carriage door, and\r\nI was wellnigh persuaded that I recognized in him the domestic of the\r\nleader of this party, whom I had seen at his house in Brokenburn on a\r\nformer occasion. To ascertain the truth of my suspicion, I asked him\r\nwhether his name was not Cristal Nixon.\r\n\r\n\'What is other folk\'s names to you,\' he replied, gruffly, \'who cannot\r\ntell your own father and mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'You know them, perhaps!\' I exclaimed eagerly. \'You know them! and with\r\nthat secret is connected the treatment which I am now receiving? It must\r\nbe so, for in my life have I never injured any one. Tell me the cause of\r\nmy misfortunes, or rather, help me to my liberty, and I will reward you\r\nrichly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye,\' replied my keeper; \'but what use to give you liberty, who\r\nknow nothing how to use it like a gentleman, but spend your time with\r\nQuakers and fiddlers, and such like raff! If I was your--hem, hem, hem!\'\r\n\r\nHere Cristal stopped short, just on the point, as it appeared, when some\r\ninformation was likely to escape him. I urged him once more to be my\r\nfriend, and promised him all the stock of money which I had about me,\r\nand it was not inconsiderable, if he would assist in my escape.\r\n\r\nHe listened, as if to a proposition which had some interest, and\r\nreplied, but in a voice rather softer than before, \'Aye, but men do not\r\ncatch old birds with chaff, my master. Where have you got the rhino you\r\nare so flush of?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will give you earnest directly, and that in banknotes,\' said I; but\r\nthrusting my hand into my side-pocket, I found my pocket-book was gone.\r\nI would have persuaded myself that it was only the numbness of my hands\r\nwhich prevented my finding it; but Cristal Nixon, who bears in his\r\ncountenance that cynicism which is especially entertained with human\r\nmisery, no longer suppressed his laughter.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, ho! my young master,\' he said; \'we have taken good enough care you\r\nhave not kept the means of bribing poor folk\'s fidelity. What, man, they\r\nhave souls as well as other people, and to make them break trust is\r\na deadly sin. And as for me, young gentleman, if you would fill Saint\r\nMary\'s Kirk with gold, Cristal Nixon would mind it no more than so many\r\nchucky-stones.\'\r\n\r\nI would have persisted, were it but in hopes of his letting drop that\r\nwhich it concerned me to know, but he cut off further communication, by\r\ndesiring me to lean back in the corner and go to sleep.\r\n\r\n\'Thou art cock-brained enough already,\' he added, \'and we shall have thy\r\nyoung pate addled entirely, if you do not take some natural rest.\'\r\n\r\nI did indeed require repose, if not slumber; the draught which I had\r\ntaken continued to operate, and, satisfied in my own mind that no\r\nattempt on my life was designed, the fear of instant death no longer\r\ncombated the torpor which crept over me--I slept, and slept soundly, but\r\nstill without refreshment.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, I found myself extremely indisposed; images of the past,\r\nand anticipations of the future, floated confusedly through my brain.\r\nI perceived, however, that my situation was changed, greatly for the\r\nbetter. I was in a good bed, with the curtains drawn round it; I heard\r\nthe lowered voice and cautious step of attendants, who seemed to respect\r\nmy repose; it appeared as if I was in the hands either of friends, or of\r\nsuch as meant me no personal harm.\r\n\r\nI can give but an indistinct account of two or three broken and feverish\r\ndays which succeeded, but if they were chequered with dreams and\r\nvisions of terror, other and more agreeable objects were also sometimes\r\npresented. Alan Fairford will understand me when I say, I am convinced I\r\nsaw G.M. during this interval of oblivion. I had medical attendance, and\r\nwas bled more than once. I also remember a painful operation performed\r\non my head, where I had received a severe blow on the night of the riot.\r\nMy hair was cut short, and the bone of the skull examined, to discover\r\nif the cranium had received any injury.\r\n\r\nOn seeing the physician, it would have been natural to have appealed\r\nto him on the subject of my confinement, and I remember more than once\r\nattempting to do so. But the fever lay like a spell upon my tongue, and\r\nwhen I would have implored the doctor\'s assistance, I rambled from the\r\nsubject, and spoke I know not what nonsense. Some power, which I\r\nwas unable to resist, seemed to impel me into a different course of\r\nconversation from what I intended, and though conscious, in some degree,\r\nof the failure, I could not mend it; and resolved, therefore, to be\r\npatient, until my capacity of steady thought and expression was restored\r\nto me with my ordinary health, which had sustained a severe shock from\r\nthe vicissitudes to which I had been exposed. [See Note 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDARSIE LATIMER\'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION\r\n\r\nTwo or three days, perhaps more, perhaps less, had been spent in bed,\r\nwhere I was carefully attended, and treated, I believe, with as much\r\njudgement as the case required, and I was at length allowed to quit\r\nmy bed, though not the chamber. I was now more able to make some\r\nobservation on the place of my confinement.\r\n\r\nThe room, in appearance and furniture, resembled the best apartment in\r\na farmer\'s house; and the window, two stories high, looked into a\r\nbackyard, or court, filled with domestic poultry. There were the usual\r\ndomestic offices about this yard. I could distinguish the brewhouse and\r\nthe barn, and I heard, from a more remote building, the lowing of the\r\ncattle, and other rural sounds, announcing a large and well-stocked\r\nfarm. These were sights and sounds qualified to dispel any apprehension\r\nof immediate violence. Yet the building seemed ancient and strong, a\r\npart of the roof was battlemented, and the walls were of great thickness;\r\nlastly, I observed, with some unpleasant sensations, that the windows\r\nof my chamber had been lately secured with iron stanchions, and that\r\nthe servants who brought me victuals, or visited my apartment to render\r\nother menial offices, always locked the door when they retired.\r\n\r\nThe comfort and cleanliness of my chamber were of true English growth,\r\nand such as I had rarely seen on the other side of the Tweed; the very\r\nold wainscot, which composed the floor and the panelling of the room,\r\nwas scrubbed with a degree of labour which the Scottish housewife rarely\r\nbestows on her most costly furniture.\r\n\r\nThe whole apartments appropriated to my use consisted of the bedroom, a\r\nsmall parlour adjacent, within which was a still smaller closet having\r\na narrow window which seemed anciently to have been used as a shot-hole,\r\nadmitting, indeed, a very moderate portion of light and air, but without\r\nits being possible to see anything from it except the blue sky, and\r\nthat only by mounting on a chair. There were appearances of a separate\r\nentrance into this cabinet, besides that which communicated with the\r\nparlour, but it had been recently built up, as I discovered by removing\r\na piece of tapestry which covered the fresh mason-work. I found some\r\nof my clothes here, with linen and other articles, as well as my\r\nwriting-case, containing pen, ink, and paper, which enables me, at my\r\nleisure (which, God knows, is undisturbed enough) to make this record of\r\nmy confinement. It may be well believed, however, that I do not trust\r\nto the security of the bureau, but carry the written sheets about my\r\nperson, so that I can only be deprived of them by actual violence. I\r\nalso am cautious to write in the little cabinet only, so that I can\r\nhear any person approach me through the other apartments, and have time\r\nenough to put aside my journal before they come upon me.\r\n\r\nThe servants, a stout country fellow and a very pretty milkmaid-looking\r\nlass, by whom I am attended, seem of the true Joan and Hedge school,\r\nthinking of little and desiring nothing beyond the very limited sphere\r\nof their own duties or enjoyments, and having no curiosity whatever\r\nabout the affairs of others. Their behaviour to me in particular, is,\r\nat the same time, very kind and very provoking. My table is abundantly\r\nsupplied, and they seem anxious to comply with my taste in that\r\ndepartment. But whenever I make inquiries beyond \'what\'s for dinner\',\r\nthe brute of a lad baffles me by his ANAN, and his DUNNA KNAW, and if\r\nhard pressed, turns his back on me composedly, and leaves the room. The\r\ngirl, too, pretends to be as simple as he; but an arch grin, which\r\nshe cannot always suppress, seems to acknowledge that she understands\r\nperfectly well the game which she is playing, and is determined to keep\r\nme in ignorance. Both of them, and the wench in particular, treat me\r\nas they would do a spoiled child, and never directly refuse me anything\r\nwhich I ask, taking care, at the same time, not to make their words good\r\nby effectually granting my request. Thus, if I desire to go out, I am\r\npromised by Dorcas that I shall walk in the park at night, and see the\r\ncows milked, just as she would propose such an amusement to a child. But\r\nshe takes care never to keep her word, if it is in her power to do so.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, there has stolen on me insensibly an indifference to\r\nmy freedom--a carelessness about my situation, for which I am unable to\r\naccount, unless it be the consequence of weakness and loss of blood. I\r\nhave read of men who, immured as I am, have surprised the world by the\r\naddress with which they have successfully overcome the most formidable\r\nobstacles to their escape; and when I have heard such anecdotes, I\r\nhave said to myself, that no one who is possessed only of a fragment\r\nof freestone, or a rusty nail to grind down rivets and to pick locks,\r\nhaving his full leisure to employ in the task, need continue the\r\ninhabitant of a prison. Here, however, I sit, day after day, without a\r\nsingle effort to effect my liberation.\r\n\r\nYet my inactivity is not the result of despondency, but arises, in\r\npart at least, from feelings of a very different cast. My story, long\r\na mysterious one, seems now upon the verge of some strange development;\r\nand I feel a solemn impression that I ought to wait the course of\r\nevents, to struggle against which is opposing my feeble efforts to the\r\nhigh will of fate. Thou, my Alan, wilt treat as timidity this passive\r\nacquiescence, which has sunk down on me like a benumbing torpor; but if\r\nthou hast remembered by what visions my couch was haunted, and dost but\r\nthink of the probability that I am in the vicinity, perhaps under the\r\nsame roof with G.M., thou wilt acknowledge that other feelings than\r\npusillanimity have tended in some degree to reconcile me to my fate.\r\n\r\nStill I own it is unmanly to submit with patience to this oppressive\r\nconfinement. My heart rises against it, especially when I sit down to\r\nrecord my sufferings in this journal, and I am determined, as the first\r\nstep to my deliverance, to have my letters sent to the post-house. ----\r\n\r\nI am disappointed. When the girl Dorcas, upon whom I had fixed for a\r\nmessenger, heard me talk of sending a letter, she willingly offered her\r\nservices, and received the crown which I gave her (for my purse had not\r\ntaken flight with the more valuable contents of my pocket-book) with a\r\nsmile which showed her whole set of white teeth.\r\n\r\nBut when, with the purpose of gaining some intelligence respecting my\r\npresent place of abode, I asked to which post-town she was to send or\r\ncarry the letter, a stolid \'ANAN\' showed me she was either ignorant of\r\nthe nature of a post-office, or that, for the present, she chose to seem\r\nso.--\'Simpleton!\' I said, with some sharpness.\r\n\r\n\'O Lord, sir!\' answered the girl, turning pale, which they always do\r\nwhen I show any sparks of anger, \'Don\'t put yourself in a passion--I\'ll\r\nput the letter in the post.\r\n\r\n\'What! and not know the name of the post-town?\' said I, out of patience.\r\n\'How on earth do you propose to manage that?\'\r\n\r\n\'La you there, good master. What need you frighten a poor girl that is\r\nno schollard, bating what she learned at the Charity School of Saint\r\nBees?\'\r\n\r\n\'Is Saint Bees far from this place, Dorcas? Do you send your letters\r\nthere?\' said I, in a manner as insinuating, and yet careless, as I could\r\nassume.\r\n\r\n\'Saint Bees! La, who but a madman--begging your honour\'s pardon--it\'s a\r\nmatter of twenty years since fader lived at Saint Bees, which is twenty,\r\nor forty, or I dunna know not how many miles from this part, to the\r\nWest, on the coast side; and I would not have left Saint Bees, but that\r\nfader\'--\r\n\r\n\'Oh, the devil take your father!\' replied I.\r\n\r\nTo which she answered, \'Nay, but thof your honour be a little\r\nhow-come-so, you shouldn\'t damn folk\'s faders; and I won\'t stand to it,\r\nfor one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I beg you a thousand pardons--I wish your father no ill in the\r\nworld--he was a very honest man in his way.\'\r\n\r\n\'WAS an honest man!\' she exclaimed; for the Cumbrians are, it would\r\nseem, like their neighbours the Scotch, ticklish on the point of\r\nancestry,--\'He IS a very honest man as ever led nag with halter on head\r\nto Staneshaw Bank Fair. Honest! He is a horse-couper.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right, right,\' I replied; \'I know it--I have heard of your father-as\r\nhonest as any horse-couper of them all. Why, Dorcas, I mean to buy a\r\nhorse of him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, your honour,\' sighed Dorcas, \'he is the man to serve your honour\r\nwell--if ever you should get round again--or thof you were a bit off the\r\nhooks, he would no more cheat you than\'--\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, we will deal, my girl, you may depend on\'t. But tell me\r\nnow, were I to give you a letter, what would you do to get it forward?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, put it into Squire\'s own bag that hangs in hall,\' answered poor\r\nDorcas. \'What else could I do? He sends it to Brampton, or to Carloisle,\r\nor where it pleases him, once a week, and that gate.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said I; \'and I suppose your sweetheart John carries it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Noa--disn\'t now--and Jan is no sweetheart of mine, ever since he danced\r\nat his mother\'s feast with Kitty Rutlege, and let me sit still; that a\r\ndid.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was most abominable in Jan, and what I could never have thought of\r\nhim,\' I replied.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but a did though--a let me sit still on my seat, a did.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, my pretty May, you will get a handsomer fellow than\r\nJan--Jan\'s not the fellow for you, I see that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Noa, noa,\' answered the damsel; \'but he is weel aneugh for a\' that,\r\nmon. But I carena a button for him; for there is the miller\'s son, that\r\nsuitored me last Appleby Fair, when I went wi\' oncle, is a gway canny\r\nlad as you will see in the sunshine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, a fine stout fellow. Do you think he would carry my letter to\r\nCarlisle?\'\r\n\r\n\'To Carloisle! \'Twould be all his life is worth; he maun wait on clap\r\nand hopper, as they say. Odd, his father would brain him if he went to\r\nCarloisle, bating to wrestling for the belt, or sic loike. But I ha\'\r\nmore bachelors than him; there is the schoolmaster, can write almaist as\r\nweel as tou canst, mon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then he is the very man to take charge of a letter; he knows the\r\ntrouble of writing one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, marry does he, an tou comest to that, mon; only it takes him four\r\nhours to write as mony lines. Tan, it is a great round hand loike, that\r\none can read easily, and not loike your honour\'s, that are like midge\'s\r\ntaes. But for ganging to Carloisle, he\'s dead foundered, man, as cripple\r\nas Eckie\'s mear.\'\r\n\r\n\'In the name of God,\' said I, \'how is it that you propose to get my\r\nletter to the post?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, just to put it into Squire\'s bag loike,\' reiterated Dorcas; \'he\r\nsends it by Cristal Nixon to post, as you call it, when such is his\r\npleasure.\'\r\n\r\nHere I was, then, not much edified by having obtained a list of Dorcas\'s\r\nbachelors; and by finding myself, with respect to any information\r\nwhich I desired, just exactly at the point where I set out. It was of\r\nconsequence to me, however, to accustom, the girl to converse with me\r\nfamiliarly. If she did so, she could not always be on her guard,\r\nand something, I thought, might drop from her which I could turn to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\'Does not the Squire usually look into his letter-bag, Dorcas?\' said I,\r\nwith as much indifference as I could assume.\r\n\r\n\'That a does,\' said Dorcas; \'and a threw out a letter of mine to Raff\r\nMiller, because a said\'--\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, I won\'t trouble him with mine,\' said I, \'Dorcas; but,\r\ninstead, I will write to himself, Dorcas. But how shall I address him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Anan?\' was again Dorcas\'s resource.\r\n\r\n\'I mean how is he called? What is his name?\'\r\n\r\n\'Sure you honour should know best,\' said Dorcas.\r\n\r\n\'I know? The devil! You drive me beyond patience.\'\r\n\r\n\'Noa, noa! donna your honour go beyond patience--donna ye now,\'\r\nimplored the wench. \'And for his neame, they say he has mair nor ane\r\nin Westmoreland and on the Scottish side. But he is but seldom wi\'\r\nus, excepting in the cocking season; and then we just call him Squoire\r\nloike; and so do my measter and dame.\'\r\n\r\n\'And is he here at present?\' said I.\r\n\r\n\'Not he, not he; he is a buck-hoonting, as they tell me, somewhere up\r\nthe Patterdale way; but he comes and gangs like a flap of a whirlwind,\r\nor sic loike.\'\r\n\r\nI broke off the conversation, after forcing on Dorcas a little silver\r\nto buy ribbons, with which she was so much delighted that she exclaimed,\r\n\'God! Cristal Nixon may say his worst on thee; but thou art a civil\r\ngentleman for all him; and a quoit man wi\' woman folk loike.\'\r\n\r\nThere is no sense in being too quiet with women folk, so I added a kiss\r\nwith my crown piece; and I cannot help thinking that I have secured\r\na partisan in Dorcas. At least, she blushed, and pocketed her little\r\ncompliment with one hand, while, with the other, she adjusted her\r\ncherry-coloured ribbons, a little disordered by the struggle it cost me\r\nto attain the honour of a salute.\r\n\r\nAs she unlocked the door to leave the apartment, she turned back,\r\nand looking on me with a strong expression of compassion, added the\r\nremarkable words, \'La--be\'st mad or no, thou\'se a mettled lad, after\r\nall.\'\r\n\r\nThere was something very ominous in the sound of these farewell words,\r\nwhich seemed to afford me a clue to the pretext under which I was\r\ndetained in confinement, My demeanour was probably insane enough, while\r\nI was agitated at once by the frenzy incident to the fever, and the\r\nanxiety arising from my extraordinary situation. But is it possible they\r\ncan now establish any cause for confining me arising out of the state of\r\nmy mind?\r\n\r\nIf this be really the pretext under which I am restrained from my\r\nliberty, nothing but the sedate correctness of my conduct can remove the\r\nprejudices which these circumstances may have excited in the minds of\r\nall who have approached me during my illness. I have heard--dreadful\r\nthought!--of men who, for various reasons, have been trepanned into\r\nthe custody of the keepers of private madhouses, and whose brain,\r\nafter years of misery, became at length unsettled, through irresistible\r\nsympathy with the wretched beings among whom they were classed. This\r\nshall not be my case, if, by strong internal resolution, it is in human\r\nnature to avoid the action of exterior and contagious sympathies.\r\n\r\nMeantime I sat down to compose and arrange my thoughts, for my purposed\r\nappeal to my jailer--so I must call him--whom I addressed in the\r\nfollowing manner; having at length, and after making several copies,\r\nfound language to qualify the sense of resentment which burned in\r\nthe first, drafts of my letter, and endeavoured to assume a tone more\r\nconciliating. I mentioned the two occasions on which he had certainly\r\nsaved my life, when at the utmost peril; and I added, that whatever was\r\nthe purpose of the restraint, now practised on me, as I was given to\r\nunderstand, by his authority, it could not certainly be with any view\r\nto ultimately injuring me. He might, I said, have mistaken me for some\r\nother person; and I gave him what account I could of my situation and\r\neducation, to correct such an error. I supposed it next possible, that\r\nhe might think me too weak for travelling, and not capable of taking\r\ncare of myself; and I begged to assure him, that I was restored to\r\nperfect health, and quite able to endure the fatigue of a journey.\r\nLastly, I reminded him, in firm though measured terms, that the\r\nrestraint which I sustained was an illegal one, and highly punishable\r\nby the laws which protect the liberties of the subject. I ended by\r\ndemanding that he would take me before a magistrate; or, at least, that\r\nhe would favour me with a personal interview and explain his meaning\r\nwith regard to me.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this letter was expressed in a tone too humble for the\r\nsituation of an injured man, and I am inclined to think so when I again\r\nrecapitulate its tenor. But what could I do? I was in the power of one\r\nwhose passions seem as violent as his means of gratifying them appear\r\nunbounded. I had reason, too, to believe (this to thee, Alan) that all\r\nhis family did not approve of the violence of his conduct towards me; my\r\nobject, in fine, was freedom, and who would not sacrifice much to attain\r\nit?\r\n\r\nI had no means of addressing my letter excepting \'For the Squire\'s\r\nown hand.\' He could be at no great distance, for in the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours I received an answer. It was addressed to Darsie\r\nLatimer, and contained these words: \'You have demanded an interview with\r\nme. You have required to be carried before a magistrate. Your first wish\r\nshall be granted--perhaps the second also. Meanwhile, be assured that\r\nyou are a prisoner for the time, by competent authority, and that\r\nsuch authority is supported by adequate power. Beware, therefore, of\r\nstruggling with a force sufficient to crush you, but abandon yourself to\r\nthat train of events by which we are both swept along, and which it is\r\nimpossible that either of us can resist.\'\r\n\r\nThese mysterious words were without signature of any kind, and left\r\nme nothing more important to do than to prepare myself for the meeting\r\nwhich they promised. For that purpose I must now break off, and make\r\nsure of the manuscript--so far as I can, in my present condition, be\r\nsure of anything--by concealing it within the lining of my coat, so as\r\nnot to be found without strict search.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLATIMER\'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION\r\n\r\nThe important interview expected at the conclusion of my last took place\r\nsooner than I had calculated; for the very day I received the letter,\r\nand just when my dinner was finished, the squire, or whatever he is\r\ncalled, entered the room so suddenly that I almost thought I beheld an\r\napparition. The figure of this man is peculiarly noble and stately,\r\nand his voice has that deep fullness of accent which implies unresisted\r\nauthority. I had risen involuntarily as he entered; we gazed on each\r\nother for a moment in silence, which was at length broken by my visitor.\r\n\r\n\'You have desired to see me,\' he said. \'I am here; if you have aught\r\nto say let me hear it; my time is too brief to be consumed in childish\r\ndumb-show.\'\r\n\r\n\'I would ask of you,\' said I, \'by what authority I am detained in this\r\nplace of confinement, and for what purpose?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have told you already,\' said he, \'that my authority is sufficient,\r\nand my power equal to it; this is all which it is necessary for you at\r\npresent to know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Every British subject has a right to know why he suffers restraint,\'\r\nI replied; \'nor can he be deprived of liberty without a legal warrant.\r\nShow me that by which you confine me thus.\'\r\n\r\n\'You shall see more,\' he said; \'you shall see the magistrate by whom it\r\nis granted, and that without a moment\'s delay.\'\r\n\r\nThis sudden proposal fluttered and alarmed me; I felt, nevertheless,\r\nthat I had the right cause, and resolved to plead it boldly, although\r\nI could well have desired a little further time for preparation. He\r\nturned, however, threw open the door of the apartment, and commanded me\r\nto follow him. I felt some inclination, when I crossed the threshold of\r\nmy prison-chamber, to have turned and run for it; but I knew not where\r\nto find the stairs--had reason to think the outer doors would be secured\r\nand, to conclude, so soon as I had quitted the room to follow the proud\r\nstep of my conductor, I observed that I was dogged by Cristal Nixon, who\r\nsuddenly appeared within two paces of me, and with whose great personal\r\nstrength, independent of the assistance he might have received from\r\nhis master, I saw no chance of contending. I therefore followed,\r\nunresistingly and in silence; along one or two passages of much greater\r\nlength than consisted with the ideas I had previously entertained of\r\nthe size of the house. At length a door was flung open, and we entered\r\na large, old-fashioned parlour, having coloured glass in the windows,\r\noaken panelling on the wall, a huge grate, in which a large faggot\r\nor two smoked under an arched chimney-piece of stone which bore some\r\narmorial device, whilst the walls were adorned with the usual number\r\nof heroes in armour, with large wigs instead of helmets, and ladies in\r\nsacques, smelling to nosegays.\r\n\r\nBehind a long table, on which were several books, sat a smart\r\nunderbred-looking man, wearing his own hair tied in a club, and who,\r\nfrom the quire of paper laid before him, and the pen which he handled\r\nat my entrance, seemed prepared to officiate as clerk. As I wish to\r\ndescribe these persons as accurately as possible, I may add, he wore a\r\ndark-coloured coat, corduroy breeches, and spatterdashes. At the\r\nupper end of the same table, in an ample easy-chair covered with black\r\nleather, reposed a fat personage, about fifty years old, who either was\r\nactually a country justice, or was well selected to represent such a\r\ncharacter. His leathern breeches were faultless in make, his jockey\r\nboots spotless in the varnish, and a handsome and flourishing pair of\r\nboot-garters, as they are called, united the one part of his garments to\r\nthe other; in fine, a richly-laced scarlet waistcoat and a purple coat\r\nset off the neat though corpulent figure of the little man, and threw an\r\nadditional bloom upon his plethoric aspect. I suppose he had dined,\r\nfor it was two hours past noon, and he was amusing himself, and aiding\r\ndigestion, with a pipe of tobacco. There was an air of importance in his\r\nmanner which corresponded to the rural dignity of his exterior, and a\r\nhabit which he had of throwing out a number of interjectional sounds,\r\nuttered with a strange variety of intonation running from bass up to\r\ntreble in a very extraordinary manner, or breaking off his sentences\r\nwith a whiff of his pipe, seemed adopted to give an air of thought and\r\nmature deliberation to his opinions and decisions. Notwithstanding\r\nall this, Alan, it might be DOOTED, as our old Professor used to say,\r\nwhether the Justice was anything more then an ass. Certainly, besides a\r\ngreat deference for the legal opinion of his clerk, which might be quite\r\naccording to the order of things, he seemed to be wonderfully under the\r\ncommand of his brother squire, if squire either of them were, and indeed\r\nmuch more than was consistent with so much assumed consequence of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\'Ho--ha--aye--so--so--hum--humph--this is the young man, I\r\nsuppose--hum--aye--seems sickly. Young gentleman, you may sit down.\'\r\n\r\nI used the permission given, for I had been much more reduced by my\r\nillness than I was aware of, and felt myself really fatigued, even by\r\nthe few paces I had walked, joined to the agitation I suffered.\r\n\r\n\'And your name, young man, is--humph--aye--ha--what is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Darsie Latimer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right--aye--humph--very right. Darsie Latimer is the very\r\nthing--ha--aye--where do you come from?\'\r\n\r\n\'From Scotland, sir,\' I replied.\r\n\r\n\'A native of Scotland--a--humph--eh--how is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am an Englishman by birth, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right--aye--yes, you are so. But pray, Mr. Darsie Latimer, have you\r\nalways been called by that name, or have you any other?--Nick, write\r\ndown his answers, Nick.\'\r\n\r\n\'As far as I remember, I never bore any other,\' was my answer.\r\n\r\n\'How, no? well, I should not have thought so, Hey, neighbour, would\r\nyou?\'\r\n\r\nHere he looked towards the other squire, who had thrown himself into a\r\nchair; and, with his legs stretched out before him, and his arms folded\r\non his bosom, seemed carelessly attending to what was going forward.\r\nHe answered the appeal of the Justice by saying, that perhaps the young\r\nman\'s memory did not go back to a very early period.\r\n\r\n\'Ah--eh--ha--you hear the gentleman. Pray, how far may your memory be\r\npleased to run back to?--umph?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps, sir, to the age of three years, or a little further.\'\r\n\r\n\'And will you presume to say, sir,\' said the squire, drawing himself\r\nsuddenly erect in his seat, and exerting the strength of his powerful\r\nvoice, \'that you then bore your present name?\'\r\n\r\nI was startled at the confidence with which this question was put, and\r\nin vain rummaged my memory for the means of replying. \'At least,\' I\r\nsaid, \'I always remember being called Darsie; children, at that early\r\nage, seldom get more than their Christian name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I thought so,\' he replied, and again stretched himself on his seat,\r\nin the same lounging posture as before.\r\n\r\n\'So you were called Darsie in your infancy,\' said the Justice;\r\n\'and--hum--aye--when did you first take the name of Latimer?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not take it, sir; it was given to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I ask you,\' said the lord of the mansion, but with less severity in his\r\nvoice than formerly, \'whether you can remember that you were ever called\r\nLatimer, until you had that name given you in Scotland?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will be candid: I cannot recollect an instance that I was so called\r\nwhen in England, but neither can I recollect when the name was first\r\ngiven me; and if anything is to be founded on these queries and my\r\nanswers, I desire my early childhood may be taken into consideration.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hum--aye--yes,\' said the Justice; \'all that requires consideration\r\nshall be duly considered. Young man--eh--I beg to know the name of your\r\nfather and mother?\'\r\n\r\nThis was galling a wound that has festered for years, and I did not\r\nendure the question so patiently as those which preceded it; but\r\nreplied, \'I demand, in my turn, to know if I am before an English\r\nJustice of the Peace?\'\r\n\r\n\'His worship, Squire Foxley, of Foxley Hall, has been of the quorum\r\nthese twenty years,\' said Master Nicholas.\r\n\r\n\'Then he ought to know, or you, sir, as his clerk, should inform him,\'\r\nsaid I, \'that I am the complainer in this case, and that my complaint\r\nought to be heard before I am subjected to cross-examination.\'\r\n\r\n\'Humph--hoy--what, aye--there is something in that, neighbour,\' said\r\nthe poor Justice, who, blown about by every wind of doctrine, seemed\r\ndesirous to attain the sanction of his brother squire.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder at you, Foxley,\' said his firm-minded acquaintance; \'how can\r\nyou render the young man justice unless you know who he is?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha--yes--egad, that\'s true,\' said Mr. Justice Foxley; \'and now--looking\r\ninto the matter more closely--there is, eh, upon the whole--nothing\r\nat all in what he says--so, sir, you must tell your father\'s name, and\r\nsurname.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is out of my power, sir; they are not known to me, since you must\r\nneeds know so much of my private affairs.\'\r\n\r\nThe Justice collected a great AFFLATUS in his cheeks, which puffed them\r\nup like those of a Dutch cherub, while his eyes seemed flying out of his\r\nhead, from the effort with which he retained his breath. He then blew\r\nit forth with,--\'Whew!--Hoom--poof--ha!--not know your parents,\r\nyoungster?--Then I must commit you for a vagrant, I warrant you. OMNE\r\nIGNOTUM PRO TERRIBILI, as we used to say at Appleby school; that is,\r\nevery one that is not known to the Justice; is a rogue and a vagabond.\r\nHa!--aye, you may sneer, sir; but I question if you would have known the\r\nmeaning of that Latin, unless I had told you.\'\r\n\r\nI acknowledged myself obliged for a new edition of the adage, and an\r\ninterpretation which I could never have reached alone and unassisted. I\r\nthen proceeded to state my case with greater confidence. The Justice\r\nwas an ass, that was clear; but if was scarcely possible he could be so\r\nutterly ignorant as not to know what was necessary in so plain a case as\r\nmine. I therefore informed him of the riot which had been committed on\r\nthe Scottish side of the Solway Firth, explained how I came to be placed\r\nin my present situation, and requested of his worship to set me at\r\nliberty. I pleaded my cause with as much earnestness as I could, casting\r\nan eye from time to time upon the opposite party, who seemed entirely\r\nindifferent to all the animation with which I accused him.\r\n\r\nAs for the Justice, when at length I had ceased, as really not\r\nknowing what more to say in a case so very plain, he replied,\r\n\'Ho--aye--aye--yes--wonderful! and so this is all the gratitude you show\r\nto this good gentleman for the great charge and trouble he hath had with\r\nrespect to and concerning of you?\'\r\n\r\n\'He saved my life, sir, I acknowledge, on one occasion certainly, and\r\nmost probably on two; but his having done so gives him no right over my\r\nperson. I am not, however, asking for any punishment or revenge; on the\r\ncontrary, I am content to part friends with the gentleman, whose motives\r\nI am unwilling to suppose are bad, though his actions have been, towards\r\nme, unauthorized and violent.\'\r\n\r\nThis moderation, Alan, thou wilt comprehend, was not entirely dictated\r\nby my feelings towards the individual of whom I complained; there were\r\nother reasons, in which regard for him had little share. It seemed,\r\nhowever, as if the mildness with which I pleaded my cause had more\r\neffect upon him than anything I had yet said. We was moved to the point\r\nof being almost out of countenance; and took snuff repeatedly, as if to\r\ngain time to stifle some degree of emotion.\r\n\r\nBut on Justice Foxley, on whom my eloquence was particularly designed to\r\nmake impression, the result was much less favourable. He consulted in a\r\nwhisper with Mr. Nicholas, his clerk--pshawed, hemmed, and elevated\r\nhis eyebrows, as if in scorn of my supplication. At length, having\r\napparently made up his mind, he leaned back in his chair, and smoked\r\nhis pipe with great energy, with a look of defiance, designed to make me\r\naware that all my reasoning was lost on him.\r\n\r\nAt length, when I stopped, more from lack of breath than want of\r\nargument, he opened his oracular jaws, and made the following reply,\r\ninterrupted by his usual interjectional ejaculations, and by long\r\nvolumes of smoke:--\'Hem--aye--eh--poof. And, youngster, do you think\r\nMatthew Foxley, who has been one of the quorum for these twenty years,\r\nis to be come over with such trash as would hardly cheat an apple-woman?\r\nPoof--poof--eh! Why, man--eh--dost thou not know the charge is not a\r\nbailable matter--and that--hum--aye--the greatest man--poof--the Baron\r\nof Graystock himself, must stand committed? and yet you pretend to have\r\nbeen kidnapped by this gentleman, and robbed of property, and what not;\r\nand--eh--poof--you would persuade me all you want is to get away from\r\nhim? I do believe--eh--that it IS all you want. Therefore, as you are\r\na sort of a slip-string gentleman, and--aye--hum--a kind of idle\r\napprentice, and something cock-brained withal, as the honest folks\r\nof the house tell me--why, you must e\'en remain under custody of your\r\nguardian, till your coming of age, or my Lord Chancellor\'s warrant,\r\nshall give you the management of your own affairs, which, if you can\r\ngather your brains again, you will even then not be--aye--hem--poof--in\r\nparticular haste to assume.\'\r\n\r\nThe time occupied by his worship\'s hums, and haws, and puffs of tobacco\r\nsmoke, together with the slow and pompous manner in which he spoke, gave\r\nme a minute\'s space to collect my ideas, dispersed as they were by the\r\nextraordinary purport of this annunciation.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot conceive, sir,\' I replied, \'by what singular tenure this\r\nperson claims my obedience as a guardian; it is a barefaced imposture. I\r\nnever in my life saw him, until I came unhappily to this country, about\r\nfour weeks since.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, sir--we--eh--know, and are aware--that--poof--you do not like\r\nto hear some folk\'s names; and that--eh--you understand me--there are\r\nthings, and sounds, and matters, conversation about names, and suchlike,\r\nwhich put you off the hooks--which I have no humour to witness.\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Darsie--or--poof--Mr. Darsie Latimer--or--poof,\r\npoof--eh--aye, Mr. Darsie without the Latimer--you have acknowledged\r\nas much to-day as assures me you will best be disposed of under the\r\nhonourable care of my friend here--all your confessions--besides that,\r\npoof--eh--I know him to be a most responsible person--a--hay--aye--most\r\nresponsible and honourable person--Can you deny this?\'\r\n\r\n\'I know nothing of him,\' I repeated; \'not even his name; and I have not,\r\nas I told you, seen him in the course of my whole life, till a few weeks\r\nsince.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you swear to that?\' said the singular man, who seemed to await the\r\nresult of this debate, secure as a rattle-snake is of the prey which\r\nhas once felt its fascination. And while he said these words in deep\r\nundertone, he withdrew his chair a little behind that of the Justice, so\r\nas to be unseen by him or his clerk, who sat upon the same side; while\r\nhe bent on me a frown so portentous, that no one who has witnessed the\r\nlook can forget it during the whole of his life. The furrows of the\r\nbrow above the eyes became livid and almost black, and were bent into\r\na semicircular, or rather elliptical form, above the junction of the\r\neyebrows. I had heard such a look described in an old tale of DIABLERIE,\r\nwhich it was my chance to be entertained with not long since; when\r\nthis deep and gloomy contortion of the frontal muscles was not unaptly\r\ndescribed as forming the representation of a small horseshoe.\r\n\r\nThe tale, when told, awaked a dreadful vision of infancy, which\r\nthe withering and blighting look now fixed on me again forced on\r\nmy recollection, but with much more vivacity. Indeed, I was so much\r\nsurprised, and, I must add, terrified, at the vague ideas which were\r\nawakened in my mind by this fearful sign, that I kept my eyes fixed on\r\nthe face in which it was exhibited, as on a frightful vision; until,\r\npassing his handkerchief a moment across his countenance, this\r\nmysterious man relaxed at once the look which had for me something\r\nso appalling. \'The young man will no longer deny that he has seen me\r\nbefore,\' said he to the Justice, in a tone of complacency; \'and I trust\r\nhe will now be reconciled to my temporary guardianship, which may end\r\nbetter for him than he expects.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whatever I expect,\' I replied, summoning my scattered recollections\r\ntogether, \'I see I am neither to expect justice nor protection from this\r\ngentleman, whose office it is to render both to the lieges. For you,\r\nsir, how strangely you have wrought yourself into the fate of an unhappy\r\nyoung man or what interest you can pretend in me, you yourself only can\r\nexplain. That I have seen you before is certain; for none can forget the\r\nlook with which you seem to have the power of blighting those upon whom\r\nyou cast it.\'\r\n\r\nThe Justice seemed not very easy under this hint,\'Ha!--aye,\' he said;\r\n\'it is time to be going, neighbour. I have a many miles to ride, and I\r\ncare not to ride darkling in these parts. You and I, Mr. Nicholas, must\r\nbe jogging.\'\r\n\r\nThe Justice fumbled with his gloves, in endeavouring to draw them on\r\nhastily, and Mr. Nicholas bustled to get his greatcoat and whip. Their\r\nlandlord endeavoured to detain them, and spoke of supper and beds. Both,\r\npouring forth many thanks for his invitation, seemed as if they would\r\nmuch rather not, and Mr. Justice Foxley was making a score of apologies,\r\nwith at least a hundred cautionary hems and eh-ehs, when the girl Dorcas\r\nburst into the room, and announced a gentleman on justice business.\r\n\r\n\'What gentleman?--and whom does he want?\'\r\n\r\n\'He is cuome post on his ten toes,\' said the wench; \'and on justice\r\nbusiness to his worship loike. I\'se uphald him a gentleman, for he\r\nspeaks as good Latin as the schule-measter; but, lack-a-day! he has\r\ngotten a queer mop of a wig.\'\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, thus announced and described, bounced into the room.\r\nBut I have already written as much as fills a sheet of my paper, and my\r\nsingular embarrassments press so hard on me that I have matter to fill\r\nanother from what followed the intrusion of--my dear Alan--your crazy\r\nclient--Poor Peter Peebles!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLATIMER\'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION\r\n\r\nSheet 2.\r\n\r\nI have rarely in my life, till the last alarming days, known what it\r\nwas to sustain a moment\'s real sorrow. What I called such, was, I am\r\nnow well convinced, only the weariness of mind which, having nothing\r\nactually present to complain of, turns upon itself and becomes anxious\r\nabout the past and the future; those periods with which human life has\r\nso little connexion, that Scripture itself hath said, \'Sufficient for\r\nthe day is the evil thereof.\'\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, I have sometimes abused prosperity, by murmuring at\r\nmy unknown birth and uncertain rank in society, I will make amends by\r\nbearing my present real adversity with patience and courage, and, if I\r\ncan, even with gaiety. What can they--dare they-do to me? Foxley, I am\r\npersuaded, is a real Justice of Peace, and country gentleman of estate,\r\nthough (wonderful to tell!) he is an ass notwithstanding; and\r\nhis functionary in the drab coat must have a shrewd guess at the\r\nconsequences of being accessory to an act of murder or kidnapping. Men\r\ninvite not such witnesses to deeds of darkness. I have also--Alan, I\r\nhave hopes, arising out of the family of the oppressor himself. I am\r\nencouraged to believe that G.M. is likely again to enter on the field.\r\nMore I dare not here say; nor must I drop a hint which another eye than\r\nthine might be able to construe. Enough, my feelings are lighter than\r\nthey have been; and, though fear and wonder are still around me, they\r\nare unable entirely to overcloud the horizon.\r\n\r\nEven when I saw the spectral form of the old scarecrow of the Parliament\r\nHouse rush into the apartment where I had undergone so singular an\r\nexamination, I thought of thy connexion with him, and could almost have\r\nparodied Lear--\r\n\r\n  Death!--nothing could have thus subdued nature\r\n  To such a lowness, but his \'learned lawyers.\'\r\n\r\nHe was e\'en as we have seen him of yore, Alan, when, rather to keep thee\r\ncompany than to follow my own bent, I formerly frequented the halls of\r\njustice. The only addition to his dress, in the capacity of a traveller,\r\nwas a pair of boots, that seemed as if they might have seen the field\r\nof Sheriffmoor; so large and heavy that, tied as they were to the\r\ncreature\'s wearied hams with large bunches of worsted tape of various\r\ncolours, they looked as if he had been dragging them along, either for a\r\nwager or by way of penance.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the surprised looks of the party on whom he thus intruded\r\nhimself, Peter blundered into the middle of the apartment, with his head\r\ncharged like a ram\'s in the act of butting, and saluted them thus:--\r\n\r\n\'Gude day to ye, gude day to your honours. Is\'t here they sell the fugie\r\nwarrants?\'\r\n\r\nI observed that on his entrance, my friend--or enemy--drew himself\r\nback, and placed himself as if he would rather avoid attracting the\r\nobservation of the new-comer. I did the same myself, as far as I was\r\nable; for I thought it likely that Mr. Peebles might recognize me, as\r\nindeed I was too frequently among the group of young juridical aspirants\r\nwho used to amuse themselves by putting cases for Peter\'s solution, and\r\nplaying him worse tricks; yet I was uncertain whether I had better avail\r\nmyself of our acquaintance to have the advantage, such as it might\r\nbe, of his evidence before the magistrate, or whether to make him,\r\nif possible, bearer of a letter which might procure me more effectual\r\nassistance. I resolved, therefore, to be guided by circumstances, and\r\nto watch carefully that nothing might escape me. I drew back as far as\r\nI could, and even reconnoitred the door and passage, to consider whether\r\nabsolute escape might not be practicable. But there paraded Cristal\r\nNixon, whose little black eyes, sharp as those of a basilisk, seemed,\r\nthe instant when they encountered mine, to penetrate my purpose.\r\n\r\nI sat down, as much out of sight of all parties as I could, and listened\r\nto the dialogue which followed--a dialogue how much more interesting to\r\nme than any I could have conceived, in which Peter Peebles was to be one\r\nof the dramatis personae!\r\n\r\n\'Is it here where ye sell the warrants--the fugies, ye ken?\' said Peter.\r\n\r\n\'Hey--eh--what!\' said Justice Foxley; \'what the devil does the fellow\r\nmean?--What would you have a warrant for?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is to apprehend a young lawyer that is IN MEDITATIONE FUGAE; for he\r\nhas ta\'en my memorial and pleaded my cause, and a good fee I gave\r\nhim, and as muckle brandy as he could drink that day at his father\'s\r\nhouse--he loes the brandy ower weel for sae youthful a creature.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what has this drunken young dog of a lawyer done to you, that\r\nyou are come to me--eh--ha? Has he robbed you? Not unlikely if he be a\r\nlawyer--eh--Nick--ha?\' said Justice Foxley.\r\n\r\n\'He has robbed me of himself, sir,\' answered Peter; \'of his help,\r\ncomfort, aid, maintenance, and assistance, whilk, as a counsel to a\r\nclient, he is bound to yield me RATIONE OFFICII--that is it, ye see. He\r\nhas pouched my fee, and drucken a mutchkin of brandy, and now he\'s ower\r\nthe march, and left my cause, half won half lost--as dead a heat as e\'er\r\nwas run ower the back-sands. Now, I was advised by some cunning laddies\r\nthat are used to crack a bit law wi\' me in the House, that the best\r\nthing I could do was to take heart o\' grace and set out after him; so I\r\nhave taken post on my ain shanks, forby a cast in a cart, or the like. I\r\ngot wind of him in Dumfries, and now I have run him ower to the English\r\nside, and I want a fugie warrant against him.\'\r\n\r\nHow did my heart throb at this information, dearest Alan! Thou art near\r\nme then, and I well know with what kind purpose; thou hast abandoned all\r\nto fly to my assistance; and no wonder that, knowing thy friendship and\r\nfaith, thy sound sagacity and persevering disposition, \'my bosom\'s\r\nlord should now sit lightly on his throne\'; that gaiety should almost\r\ninvoluntarily hover on my pen; and that my heart should beat like that\r\nof a general, responsive to the drums of his advancing ally, without\r\nwhose help the battle must have been lost.\r\n\r\nI did not suffer myself to be startled by this joyous surprise, but\r\ncontinued to bend my strictest attention to what followed among this\r\nsingular party. That Poor Peter Peebles had been put on this wildgoose\r\nchase by some of his juvenile advisers in the Parliament House, he\r\nhimself had intimated; but he spoke with much confidence, and the\r\nJustice, who seemed to have some secret apprehension of being put to\r\ntrouble in the matter, and, as sometimes occurs on the English frontier,\r\na jealousy lest the superior acuteness of their northern neighbours\r\nmight overreach their own simplicity, turned to his clerk with a\r\nperplexed countenance.\r\n\r\n\'Eh--oh--Nick--d--n thee--Hast thou got nothing to say? This is more\r\nScots law, I take it, and more Scotsmen.\' (Here he cast a side-glance at\r\nthe owner of the mansion, and winked to his clerk.) \'I would Solway were\r\nas deep as it is wide, and we had then some chance of keeping of them\r\nout.\'\r\n\r\nNicholas conversed an instant aside with the supplicant, and then\r\nreported:--\r\n\r\n\'The man wants a border-warrant, I think; but they are only granted for\r\ndebt--now he wants one to catch a lawyer.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what for no?\' answered Peter Peebles, doggedly; \'what for no, I\r\nwould be glad to ken? If a day\'s labourer refuse to work, ye\'ll grant a\r\nwarrant to gar him do out his daurg--if a wench quean rin away from\r\nher hairst, ye\'ll send her back to her heuck again--if sae mickle as a\r\ncollier or a salter make a moonlight flitting, ye will cleek him by the\r\nback-spaul in a minute of time--and yet the damage canna amount to mair\r\nthan a creelfu\' of coals, and a forpit or twa of saut; and here is a\r\nchield taks leg from his engagement, and damages me to the tune of sax\r\nthousand punds sterling; that is, three thousand that I should win, and\r\nthree thousand mair that I am like to lose; and you that ca\' yourself a\r\njustice canna help a poor man to catch the rinaway? A bonny like justice\r\nI am like to get amang ye!\'\r\n\r\n\'The fellow must be drunk,\' said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\'Black fasting from all but sin,\' replied the supplicant; \'I havena had\r\nmair than a mouthful of cauld water since I passed the Border, and deil\r\na ane of ye is like to say to me, "Dog, will ye drink?"\'\r\n\r\nThe Justice seemed moved by this appeal. \'Hem---tush, man,\' replied he;\r\n\'thou speak\'st to us as if thou wert in presence of one of thine own\r\nbeggarly justices--get downstairs--get something to eat, man (with\r\npermission of my friend to make so free in his house), and a mouthful to\r\ndrink, and I warrant we get ye such justice as will please ye.\'\r\n\r\n\'I winna refuse your neighbourly offer,\' said Poor Peter Peebles, making\r\nhis bow; \'muckle grace be wi\' your honour, and wisdom to guide you in\r\nthis extraordinary cause.\'\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Peter Peebles about to retire from the room, I could not\r\nforbear an effort to obtain from him such evidence as might give me some\r\ncredit with the Justice. I stepped forward, therefore, and, saluting\r\nhim, asked him if he remembered me?\r\n\r\nAfter a stare or two, and a long pinch of snuff, recollection seemed\r\nsuddenly to dawn on Peter Peebles. \'Recollect ye!\' he said; \'by my troth\r\ndo I.---Haud him a grip, gentlemen!--constables, keep him fast! where\r\nthat ill-deedie hempy is, ye are sure that Alan Fairford is not far off.\r\nHaud him fast, Master Constable; I charge ye wi\' him, for I am mista\'en\r\nif he is not at the bottom of this rinaway business. He was aye getting\r\nthe silly callant Alan awa wi\' gigs, and horse, and the like of that, to\r\nRoslin, and Prestonpans, and a\' the idle gates he could think of. He\'s a\r\nrinaway apprentice, that ane.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Peebles,\' I said, \'do not do me wrong. I am sure you can say no\r\nharm of me justly, but can satisfy these gentlemen, if you will, that I\r\nam a student of law in Edinburgh--Darsie Latimer by name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Me satisfy! how can I satisfy the gentlemen,\' answered Peter, \'that am\r\nsae far from being satisfied mysell? I ken naething about your name, and\r\ncan only testify, NIHIL NOVIT IN CAUSA.\'\r\n\r\n\'A pretty witness you have brought forward in your favour,\' said Mr.\r\nFoxley. \'But--ha--aye---I\'ll ask him a question or two. Pray, friend,\r\nwill you take your oath to this youth being a runaway apprentice?\'\r\n\r\n\'Sir,\' said Peter, \'I will make oath to onything in reason; when a case\r\ncomes to my oath it\'s a won cause: But I am in some haste to prie your\r\nworship\'s good cheer;\' for Peter had become much more respectful in\r\nhis demeanour towards the Justice since he had heard some intimation of\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n\'You shall have--eh--hum--aye--a bellyful, if it be possible to fill it.\r\nFirst let me know if this young man be really what he pretends. Nick,\r\nmake his affidavit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ow, he is just a wud harum-scarum creature, that wad never take to his\r\nstudies; daft, sir, clean daft.\'\r\n\r\n\'Deft!\' said the Justice; \'what d\'ye mean by deft--eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just Fifish,\' replied Peter; \'wowf--a wee bit by the East Nook or sae;\r\nit\'s a common case--the ae half of the warld thinks the tither daft. I\r\nhave met with folk in my day that thought I was daft mysell; and, for my\r\npart, I think our Court of Session clean daft, that have had the great\r\ncause of Peebles against Plainstanes before them for this score of\r\nyears, and have never been able to ding the bottom out of it yet.\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot make out a word of his cursed brogue,\' said the Cumbrian\r\njustice; \'can you, neighbour--eh? What can he mean by DEFT?\'\r\n\r\n\'He means MAD,\' said the party appealed to, thrown off his guard by\r\nimpatience of this protracted discussion.\r\n\r\n\'Ye have it--ye have it,\' said Peter; \'that is, not clean skivie, but--\'\r\n\r\nHere he stopped, and fixed his eye on the person he addressed with an\r\nair of joyful recognition.--\'Aye, aye, Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, is\r\nthis your ainsell in blood and bane? I thought ye had been hanged at\r\nKennington Common, or Hairiebie, or some of these places, after the\r\nbonny ploy ye made in the Forty-five.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe you are mistaken, friend,\' said Herries, sternly, with whose\r\nname and designation I was thus made unexpectedly acquainted.\r\n\r\n\'The deil a bit,\' answered the undaunted Peter Peebles; I mind ye weel,\r\nfor ye lodged in my house the great year of Forty-five, for a great\r\nyear it was; the Grand Rebellion broke out, and my cause--the great\r\ncause--Peebles against Plainstanes, ET PER CONTRA--was called in the\r\nbeginning of the winter session, and would have been heard, but that\r\nthere was a surcease of justice, with your plaids, and your piping, and\r\nyour nonsense.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you, fellow,\' said Herries, yet more fiercely, \'you have\r\nconfused me with some of the other furniture of your crazy pate.\'\r\n\r\n\'Speak like a gentleman, sir,\' answered Peebles; \'these are not legal\r\nphrases, Mr. Herries of Birrenswork. Speak in form of law, or I sall bid\r\nye gude day, sir. I have nae pleasure in speaking to proud folk, though\r\nI am willing to answer onything in a legal way; so if you are for\r\na crack about auld langsyne, and the splores that you and Captain\r\nRedgimlet used to breed in my house, and the girded cask of brandy that\r\nye drank and ne\'er thought of paying for it (not that I minded it muckle\r\nin thae days, though I have felt a lack of it sin syne), why I will\r\nwaste an hour on ye at ony time.--and where is Captain Redgimlet now?\r\nhe was a wild chap, like yoursell, though they arena sae keen after you\r\npoor bodies for these some years bygane; the heading and hanging is weel\r\nower now--awful job--awful job--will ye try my sneeshing?\'\r\n\r\nHe concluded his desultory speech by thrusting out his large bony paw,\r\nfilled with a Scottish mull of huge dimensions, which Herries, who had\r\nbeen standing like one petrified by the assurance of this unexpected\r\naddress, rejected with a contemptuous motion of his hand, which spilled\r\nsome of the contents of the box.\r\n\r\n\'Aweel, aweel,\' said Peter Peebles, totally unabashed by the repulse,\r\n\'e\'en as ye like, a wilful man maun hae his way; but,\' he added,\r\nstooping down and endeavouring to gather the spilled snuff from the\r\npolished floor, \'I canna afford to lose my sneeshing for a\' that ye are\r\ngumple-foisted wi\' me.\'\r\n\r\nMy attention had been keenly awakened, during this extraordinary and\r\nunexpected scene. I watched, with as much attention as my own agitation\r\npermitted me to command, the effect produced on the parties concerned.\r\nIt was evident that our friend, Peter Peebles, had unwarily let out\r\nsomething which altered the sentiments of Justice Foxley and his clerk\r\ntowards Mr. Herries, with whom, until he was known and acknowledged\r\nunder that name, they had appeared to be so intimate. They talked with\r\neach other aside, looked at a paper or two which the clerk selected\r\nfrom the contents of a huge black pocket-book, and seemed, under the\r\ninfluence of fear and uncertainty, totally at a loss what line of\r\nconduct to adopt.\r\n\r\nHerries made a different, and far more interesting figure. However\r\nlittle Peter Peebles might resemble the angel Ithuriel, the appearance\r\nof Herries, his high and scornful demeanour, vexed at what seemed\r\ndetection yet fearless of the consequences, and regarding the whispering\r\nmagistrate and his clerk with looks in which contempt predominated over\r\nanger or anxiety, bore, in my opinion, no slight resemblance to\r\n\r\n     the regal port\r\n  And faded splendour wan\r\n\r\nwith which the poet has invested the detected King of the powers of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAs he glanced round, with a look which he had endeavoured to compose to\r\nhaughty indifference, his eye encountered mine, and, I thought, at\r\nthe first glance sank beneath it. But he instantly rallied his natural\r\nspirit, and returned me one of those extraordinary looks, by which he\r\ncould contort so strangely the wrinkles on his forehead. I started; but,\r\nangry at myself for my pusillanimity, I answered him by a look of the\r\nsame kind, and catching the reflection of my countenance in a large\r\nantique mirror which stood before me, I started again at the real or\r\nimaginary resemblance which my countenance, at that moment, bore to that\r\nof Herries. Surely my fate is somehow strangely interwoven with that of\r\nthis mysterious individual. I had no time at present to speculate upon\r\nthe subject, for the subsequent conversation demanded all my attention.\r\n\r\nThe Justice addressed Herries, after a pause of about five minutes, in\r\nwhich, all parties seemed at some loss how to proceed. He spoke with\r\nembarrassment, and his faltering voice, and the long intervals which\r\ndivided his sentences, seemed to indicate fear of him whom he addressed.\r\n\r\n\'Neighbour,\' he said, \'I could not have thought this; or, if I--eh--DID\r\nthink--in a corner of my own mind as it were--that you, I say--that you\r\nmight have unluckily engaged in--eh--the matter of the Forty-five--there\r\nwas still time to have forgot all that.\'\r\n\r\n\'And is it so singular that a man should have been out in the\r\nForty-five?\' said Herries, with contemptuous composure;--\'your father, I\r\nthink, Mr. Foxley, was out with Derwentwater in the Fifteen.\'\r\n\r\n\'And lost half of his estate,\' answered Foxley, with more rapidity than\r\nusual; \'and was very near--hem--being hanged into the boot. But this\r\nis--another guess job--for--eh--Fifteen is not Forty-five; and my father\r\nhad a remission, and you, I take it, have none.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps I have,\' said Herries indifferently; \'or if I have not, I am\r\nbut in the case of half a dozen others whom government do not think\r\nworth looking after at this time of day, so they give no offence or\r\ndisturbance.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you have given both, sir,\' said Nicholas Faggot, the clerk, who,\r\nhaving some petty provincial situation, as I have since understood,\r\ndeemed himself bound to be zealous for government, \'Mr. Justice Foxley\r\ncannot be answerable for letting you pass free, now your name and\r\nsurname have been spoken plainly out. There are warrants out against you\r\nfrom the Secretary of State\'s office.\'\r\n\r\n\'A proper allegation, Mr. Attorney! that, at the distance of so\r\nmany years, the Secretary of State should trouble himself about the\r\nunfortunate relics of a ruined cause,\' answered Mr. Herries.\r\n\r\n\'But if it be so,\' said the clerk, who seemed to assume more confidence\r\nupon the composure of Herries\'s demeanour; \'and if cause has been given\r\nby the conduct of a gentleman himself, who hath been, it is\r\nalleged, raking up old matters, and mixing them with new subjects of\r\ndisaffection--I say, if it be so, I should advise the party, in his\r\nwisdom, to surrender himself quietly into the lawful custody of the next\r\nJustice of Peace--Mr. Foxley, suppose--where, and by whom, the matter\r\nshould be regularly inquired into. I am only putting a case,\' he added,\r\nwatching with apprehension the effect which his words were likely to\r\nproduce upon the party to whom they were addressed.\r\n\r\n\'And were I to receive such advice,\' said Herries, with the same\r\ncomposure as before--\'putting the case, as you say, Mr. Faggot--I\r\nshould request to see the warrant which countenanced such a scandalous\r\nproceeding.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Nicholas, by way of answer, placed in his hand a paper, and seemed\r\nanxiously to expect the consequences which were to ensue. Mr. Herries\r\nlooked it over with the same equanimity as before, and then continued,\r\n\'And were such a scrawl as this presented to me in my own house, I would\r\nthrow it into the chimney, and Mr. Faggot upon the top of it.\'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, seconding the word with the action, he flung the warrant\r\ninto the fire with one hand, and fixed the other, with a stern and\r\nirresistible grip, on the breast of the attorney, who, totally unable to\r\ncontend with him, in either personal strength or mental energy, trembled\r\nlike a chicken in the raven\'s clutch. He got off, however, for the\r\nfright; for Herries, having probably made him fully sensible of the\r\nstrength of his grasp, released him, with a scornful laugh.\r\n\r\n\'Deforcement--spulzie-stouthrief--masterful rescue!\' exclaimed Peter\r\nPeebles, scandalized at the resistance offered to the law in the person\r\nof Nicholas Faggot. But his shrill exclamations were drowned in the\r\nthundering voice of Herries, who, calling upon Cristal Nixon, ordered\r\nhim to take the bawling fool downstairs, fill his belly, and then give\r\nhim a guinea, and thrust him out of doors. Under such injunctions, Peter\r\neasily suffered himself to be withdrawn from the scene.\r\n\r\nHerries then turned to the Justice, whose visage, wholly abandoned by\r\nthe rubicund hue which so lately beamed upon it, hung out the same pale\r\nlivery as that of his dismayed clerk. \'Old friend and acquaintance,\'\r\nhe said, \'you came here at my request on a friendly errand, to convince\r\nthis silly young man of the right which I have over his person for the\r\npresent. I trust you do not intend to make your visit the pretext of\r\ndisquieting me about other matters? All the world knows that I have been\r\nliving at large, in these northern counties, for some months, not to say\r\nyears, and might have been apprehended at any time, had the necessities\r\nof the state required, or my own behaviour deserved it. But no English\r\nmagistrate has been ungenerous enough to trouble a gentleman under\r\nmisfortune, on account of political opinions and disputes which have\r\nbeen long ended by the success of the reigning powers. I trust, my good\r\nfriend, you will not endanger yourself by taking any other view of the\r\nsubject than you have done ever since we were acquainted?\'\r\n\r\nThe Justice answered with more readiness, as well as more spirit than\r\nusual, \'Neighbour Ingoldsby--what you say--is--eh--in some sort\r\ntrue; and when you were coming and going at markets, horse-races,\r\nand cock-fights, fairs, hunts, and such-like--it was--eh--neither my\r\nbusiness nor my wish to dispel--I say--to inquire into and dispel the\r\nmysteries which hung about you; for while you were a good companion\r\nin the field, and over a bottle now and then--I did not--eh--think\r\nit necessary to ask--into your private affairs. And if I thought\r\nyou were--ahem--somewhat unfortunate in former undertakings, and\r\nenterprises, and connexions, which might cause you to live unsettledly\r\nand more private, I could have--eh--very little pleasure--to aggravate\r\nyour case by interfering, or requiring explanations, which are often\r\nmore easily asked than given. But when there are warrants and witnesses\r\nto names--and those names, christian and surname, belong to--eh--an\r\nattainted person--charged--I trust falsely--with--ahem-taking advantage\r\nof modern broils and heart-burnings to renew our civil disturbances, the\r\ncase is altered; and I must--ahem--do my duty.\'\r\n\r\nThe Justice, got on his feet as he concluded this speech, and looked\r\nas bold as he could. I drew close beside him and his clerk, Mr. Faggot,\r\nthinking the moment favourable for my own liberation, and intimated\r\nto Mr. Foxley my determination to stand by him. But Mr. Herries only\r\nlaughed at the menacing posture which we assumed. \'My good neighbour,\'\r\nsaid he, \'you talk of a witness. Is yon crazy beggar a fit witness in an\r\naffair of this nature?\'\r\n\r\n\'But you do not deny that you are Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, mentioned\r\nin the Secretary of State\'s warrant?\' said Mr. Foxley.\r\n\r\n\'How can I deny or own anything about it?\' said Herries, with a sneer.\r\n\'There is no such warrant in existence now; its ashes, like the poor\r\ntraitor whose doom it threatened, have been dispersed to the four winds\r\nof heaven. There is now no warrant in the world.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you will not deny,\' said the Justice, \'that you were the person\r\nnamed in it; and that--eh--your own act destroyed it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will neither deny my name nor my actions, Justice,\' replied Mr.\r\nHerries, \'when called upon by competent authority to avow or defend\r\nthem. But I will resist all impertinent attempts either to intrude into\r\nmy private motives, or to control my person. I am quite well prepared to\r\ndo so; and I trust that you, my good neighbour and brother sportsman,\r\nin your expostulation, and my friend Mr. Nicholas Faggot here, in his\r\nhumble advice and petition that I should surrender myself, will consider\r\nyourselves as having amply discharged your duty to King George and\r\ngovernment.\'\r\n\r\nThe cold and ironical tone in which he made this declaration; the look\r\nand attitude, so nobly expressive of absolute confidence in his own\r\nsuperior strength and energy, seemed to complete the indecision which\r\nhad already shown itself on the side of those whom he addressed.\r\n\r\nThe Justice looked to the clerk--the clerk to the Justice; the former\r\nHA\'D, EH\'D, without bringing forth an articulate syllable; the latter\r\nonly said, \'As the warrant is destroyed, Mr. Justice, I presume you do\r\nnot mean to proceed with the arrest?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hum--aye--why, no--Nicholas--it would not be quite advisable--and as\r\nthe Forty-five was an old affair--and--hem--as my friend here will,\r\nI hope, see his error--that is, if he has not seen it already--and\r\nrenounce the Pope, the Devil, and the Pretender--I mean no harm,\r\nneighbour--I think we--as we have no POSSE, or constables, or the\r\nlike--should order our horses--and, in one word, look the matter over.\'\r\n\r\n\'Judiciously resolved,\' said the person whom this decision affected;\r\n\'but before you go, I trust you will drink and be friends?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why,\' said the Justice, rubbing his brow, \'our business has\r\nbeen--hem--rather a thirsty one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cristal Nixon,\' said Mr. Herries, \'let us have a cool tankard\r\ninstantly, large enough to quench the thirst of the whole commission.\'\r\n\r\nWhile Cristal was absent on this genial errand, there was a pause, of\r\nwhich I endeavoured to avail myself by bringing back the discourse to\r\nmy own concerns. \'Sir,\' I said to Justice Foxley, \'I have no direct\r\nbusiness with your late discussion with Mr. Herries, only just thus\r\nfar--You leave me, a loyal subject of King George, an unwilling prisoner\r\nin the hands of a person whom you have reason to believe unfriendly to\r\nthe king\'s cause. I humbly submit that this is contrary to your duty\r\nas a magistrate, and that you ought to make Mr. Herries aware of the\r\nillegality of his proceedings, and take steps for my rescue, either upon\r\nthe spot, or, at least, as soon as possible after you have left this\r\ncase\'--\r\n\r\n\'Young man,\' said Mr. Justice Foxley, \'I would have you remember you are\r\nunder the power, the lawful power--ahem--of your guardian.\'\r\n\r\n\'He calls himself so, indeed,\' I replied; \'but he has shown no evidence\r\nto establish so absurd a claim; and if he had, his circumstances, as an\r\nattainted traitor excepted from pardon, would void such a right if it\r\nexisted. I do therefore desire you, Mr. Justice, and you, his clerk, to\r\nconsider my situation, and afford me relief at your peril.\'\r\n\r\n\'Here is a young fellow now,\' said the Justice, with much-embarrassed\r\nlooks, \'thinks that I carry the whole statute law of England in my head,\r\nand a POSSE COMITATUS to execute them in my pocket! Why, what good would\r\nmy interference do?--but--hum--eh--I will speak to your guardian in your\r\nfavour.\'\r\n\r\nHe took Mr. Herries aside, and seemed indeed to urge something upon him\r\nwith much earnestness; and perhaps such a species of intercession was\r\nall which, in the circumstances, I was entitled to expect from him.\r\n\r\nThey often looked at me as they spoke together; and as Cristal Nixon\r\nentered with a huge four-pottle tankard, filled with the beverage\r\nhis master had demanded, Herries turned away from Mr. Foxley somewhat\r\nimpatiently, saying with emphasis, \'I give you my word of honour, that\r\nyou have not the slightest reason to apprehend anything on his account.\'\r\nHe then took up the tankard, and saying aloud in Gaelic, \'SLAINT AN\r\nREY,\' [The King\'s health.] just tasted the liquor, and handed the\r\ntankard to Justice Foxley, who, to avoid the dilemma of pledging him to\r\nwhat might be the Pretender\'s health, drank to Mr. Herries\'s own, with\r\nmuch pointed solemnity, but in a draught far less moderate.\r\n\r\nThe clerk imitated the example of his principal, and I was fain to\r\nfollow their example, for anxiety and fear are at least as thirsty as\r\nsorrow is said to be. In a word, we exhausted the composition of ale,\r\nsherry, lemon-juice, nutmeg, and other good things, stranded upon the\r\nsilver bottom of the tankard the huge toast, as well as the roasted\r\norange, which had whilom floated jollily upon the brim, and rendered\r\nlegible Dr. Byrom\'s celebrated lines engraved thereon--\r\n\r\n  God bless the King!--God bless the Faith\'s defender!\r\n  God bless--No harm in blessing--the Pretender.\r\n  Who that Pretender is, and who that King,--\r\n  God bless us all!--is quite another thing.\r\n\r\nI had time enough to study this effusion of the Jacobite muse, while the\r\nJustice was engaged in the somewhat tedious ceremony of taking leave.\r\nThat of Mr. Faggot was less ceremonious; but I suspect something besides\r\nempty compliment passed betwixt him and Mr. Herries; for I remarked that\r\nthe latter slipped a piece of paper into the hand of the former, which\r\nmight perhaps be a little atonement for the rashness with which he had\r\nburnt the warrant, and imposed no gentle hand on the respectable minion\r\nof the law by whom it was exhibited; and I observed that he made this\r\npropitiation in such a manner as to be secret from the worthy clerk\'s\r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\nWhen this was arranged, the party took leave of each other with much\r\nformality on the part of Squire Foxley, amongst whose adieus the\r\nfollowing phrase was chiefly remarkable: \'I presume you do not intend to\r\nstay long in these parts?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not for the present, Justice, you may be sure; there are good reasons\r\nto the contrary. But I have no doubt of arranging my affairs so that we\r\nshall speedily have sport together again.\'\r\n\r\nHe went to wait upon the Justice to the courtyard; and, as he did\r\nso, commanded Cristal Nixon to see that I returned into my apartment.\r\nKnowing it would be to no purpose to resist or tamper with that stubborn\r\nfunctionary, I obeyed in silence, and was once more a prisoner in my\r\nformer quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLATIMER\'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION\r\n\r\nI spent more than an hour, after returning to the apartment which I may\r\ncall my prison, in reducing to writing the singular circumstances which\r\nI had just witnessed. Methought I could now form some guess at the\r\ncharacter of Mr. Herries, upon whose name and situation the late\r\nscene had thrown considerable light--one of those fanatical Jacobites,\r\ndoubtless, whose arms, not twenty years since, had shaken the British\r\nthrone, and some of whom, though their party daily diminished in\r\nnumbers, energy, and power, retained still an inclination to renew the\r\nattempt they had found so desperate. He was indeed perfectly different\r\nfrom the sort of zealous Jacobites whom it had been my luck hitherto to\r\nmeet with. Old ladies of family over their hyson, and grey-haired lairds\r\nover their punch, I had often heard utter a little harmless treason;\r\nwhile the former remembered having led down a dance with the Chevalier,\r\nand the latter recounted the feats they had performed at Preston,\r\nClifton, and Falkirk.\r\n\r\nThe disaffection of such persons was too unimportant to excite the\r\nattention of government. I had heard, however, that there still\r\nexisted partisans of the Stuart family of a more daring and dangerous\r\ndescription; men who, furnished with gold from Rome, moved, secretly and\r\nin disguise, through the various classes of society, and endeavoured to\r\nkeep alive the expiring zeal of their party.\r\n\r\nI had no difficulty in assigning an important post among this class of\r\npersons, whose agency and exertion are only doubted by those who look\r\non the surface of things, to this Mr. Herries, whose mental energies, as\r\nwell as his personal strength and activity, seemed to qualify him\r\nwell to act so dangerous a part; and I knew that all along the Western\r\nBorder, both in England and Scotland, there are so many nonjurors, that\r\nsuch a person may reside there with absolute safety, unless it becomes,\r\nin a very especial degree, the object of the government to secure his\r\nperson; and which purpose, even then, might be disappointed by early\r\nintelligence, or, as in the case of Mr. Foxley, by the unwillingness\r\nof provincial magistrates to interfere in what is now considered an\r\ninvidious pursuit of the unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThere have, however, been rumours lately, as if the present state of the\r\nnation or at least of some discontented provinces, agitated by a\r\nvariety of causes but particularly by the unpopularity of the present\r\nadministration, may seem to this species of agitators a favourable\r\nperiod for recommencing their intrigues; while, on the other hand,\r\ngovernment may not, at such a crisis, be inclined to look upon them\r\nwith the contempt which a few years ago would have been their most\r\nappropriate punishment.\r\n\r\nThat men should be found rash enough to throw away their services and\r\nlives in a desperate cause, is nothing new in history, which abounds\r\nwith instances of similar devotion--that Mr. Herries is such an\r\nenthusiast is no less evident; but all this explains not his conduct\r\ntowards me. Had he sought to make me a proselyte to his ruined cause,\r\nviolence and compulsion were arguments very unlikely to prevail with any\r\ngenerous spirit. But even if such were his object, of what use to him\r\ncould be the acquisition of a single reluctant partisan, who could bring\r\nonly his own person to support any quarrel which he might adopt? He had\r\nclaimed over me the rights of a guardian; he had more than hinted that\r\nI was in a state of mind which could not dispense with the authority of\r\nsuch a person. Was this man, so sternly desperate in his purpose--he\r\nwho seemed willing to take on his own shoulders the entire support of\r\na cause which had been ruinous to thousands--was he the person that had\r\nthe power of deciding on my fate? Was it from him those dangers flowed,\r\nto secure me against which I had been educated under such circumstances\r\nof secrecy and precaution?\r\n\r\nAnd if this was so, of what nature was the claim which he asserted?--Was\r\nit that of propinquity? And did I share the blood, perhaps the features,\r\nof this singular being?--Strange as it may seem, a thrill of awe, which\r\nshot across my mind at that instant, was not unmingled with a wild and\r\nmysterious feeling of wonder, almost amounting to pleasure. I remembered\r\nthe reflection of my own face in the mirror at one striking moment\r\nduring the singular interview of the day, and I hastened to the outward\r\napartment to consult a glass which hung there, whether it were possible\r\nfor my countenance to be again contorted into the peculiar frown which\r\nso much resembled the terrific look of Herries. But I folded my brows\r\nin vain into a thousand complicated wrinkles, and I was obliged to\r\nconclude, either that the supposed mark on my brow was altogether\r\nimaginary, or that it could not be called forth by voluntary effort; or,\r\nin fine, what seemed most likely, that it was such a resemblance as the\r\nimagination traces in the embers of a wood fire, or among the varied\r\nveins of marble, distinct at one time, and obscure or invisible at\r\nanother, according as the combination of lines strikes the eye or\r\nimpresses the fancy.\r\n\r\nWhile I was moulding my visage like a mad player, the door suddenly\r\nopened, and the girl of the house entered. Angry and ashamed at being\r\ndetected in my singular occupation, I turned round sharply, and, I\r\nsuppose, chance produced the change on my features which I had been in\r\nvain labouring to call forth.\r\n\r\nThe girl started back, with her \'Don\'t ya look so now--don\'t ye, for\r\nlove\'s sake--you be as like the ould squoire as--But here a comes,\' she\r\nsaid, huddling away out of the room; \'and if you want a third, there is\r\nnone but ould Harry, as I know of, that can match ye for a brent broo!\'\r\n\r\nAs the girl muttered this exclamation, and hastened out of the room,\r\nHerries entered. He stopped on observing that I had looked again to the\r\nmirror, anxious to trace the look by which the wench had undoubtedly\r\nbeen terrified. He seemed to guess what was passing in my mind, for, as\r\nI turned towards him, he observed, \'Doubt not that it is stamped on your\r\nforehead--the fatal mark of our race; though it is not now so apparent\r\nas it will become when age and sorrow, and the traces of stormy passions\r\nand of bitter penitence, shall have drawn their furrows on your brow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mysterious man,\' I replied, \'I know not of what you speak; your\r\nlanguage is as dark as your purposes!\'\r\n\r\n\'Sit down, then,\' he said, \'and listen; thus far, at least, must the\r\nveil of which you complain be raised. When withdrawn, it will only\r\ndisplay guilt and sorrow--guilt followed by strange penalty, and sorrow\r\nwhich Providence has entailed upon the posterity of the mourners.\'\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, and commenced his narrative, which he told with the\r\nair of one, who, remote as the events were which he recited, took\r\nstill the deepest interest in them. The tone of his voice, which I have\r\nalready described as rich and powerful, aided by its inflections the\r\neffects of his story, which I will endeavour to write down, as nearly as\r\npossible, in the very words which he used.\r\n\r\n\'It was not of late years that the English learned that their best\r\nchance of conquering their independent neighbours must be by introducing\r\namongst them division and civil war. You need not be reminded of the\r\nstate of thraldom to which Scotland was reduced by the unhappy wars\r\nbetwixt the domestic factions of Bruce and Baliol, nor how, after\r\nScotland had been emancipated from a foreign yoke by the conduct and\r\nvalour of the immortal Bruce, the whole fruits of the triumphs of\r\nBannockburn were lost in the dreadful defeats of Dupplin and Halidon;\r\nand Edward Baliol, the minion and feudatory of his namesake of England,\r\nseemed, for a brief season, in safe and uncontested possession of the\r\nthrone so lately occupied by the greatest general and wisest prince in\r\nEurope. But the experience of Bruce had not died with him. There\r\nwere many who had shared his martial labours, and all remembered the\r\nsuccessful efforts by which, under circumstances as disadvantageous as\r\nthose of his son, he had achieved the liberation of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\'The usurper, Edward Baliol, was feasting with a few of his favourite\r\nretainers in the castle of Annan, when he was suddenly surprised by a\r\nchosen band of insurgent patriots. Their chiefs were, Douglas, Randolph,\r\nthe young Earl of Moray, and Sir Simon Fraser; and their success was so\r\ncomplete, that Baliol was obliged to fly for his life scarcely\r\nclothed, and on a horse which there was no leisure to saddle. It was of\r\nimportance to seize his person, if possible, and his flight was closely\r\npursued by a valiant knight of Norman descent, whose family had been\r\nlong settled in the marches of Dumfriesshire. Their Norman appellation\r\nwas Fitz-Aldin, but this knight, from the great slaughter which he had\r\nmade of the Southron, and the reluctance which he had shown to admit\r\nthem to quarter during the former war of that bloody period, had\r\nacquired the name of Redgauntlet, which he transmitted to his\r\nposterity\'--\r\n\r\n\'Redgauntlet!\' I involuntarily repeated.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Redgauntlet,\' said my alleged guardian, looking at me keenly;\r\n\'does that name recall any associations to your mind?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' I replied, \'except that I had lately heard it given to the hero of\r\na supernatural legend.\'\r\n\r\n\'There are many such current concerning the family,\' he answered; and\r\nthen proceeded in his narrative.\r\n\r\n\'Alberick Redgauntlet, the first of his house so termed, was, as may be\r\nsupposed from his name, of a stern and implacable disposition, which\r\nhad been rendered more so by family discord. An only son, now a youth\r\nof eighteen, shared so much the haughty spirit of his father, that he\r\nbecame impatient of domestic control, resisted paternal authority, and\r\nfinally fled from his father\'s house, renounced his political opinions,\r\nand awakened his mortal displeasure by joining the adherents of Baliol.\r\nIt was said that his father cursed, in his wrath, his degenerate\r\noffspring, and swore that if they met he should perish by his hand.\r\nMeantime, circumstances seemed to promise atonement for this great\r\ndeprivation. The lady of Alberick Redgauntlet was again, after many\r\nyears, in a situation which afforded her husband the hope of a more\r\ndutiful heir.\r\n\r\n\'But the delicacy and deep interest of his wife\'s condition did not\r\nprevent Alberick from engaging in the undertaking of Douglas and Moray.\r\nHe had been the most forward in the attack of the castle, and was now\r\nforemost in the pursuit of Baliol, eagerly engaged in dispersing or\r\ncutting down the few daring followers who endeavoured to protect the\r\nusurper in his flight.\r\n\r\n\'As these were successively routed or slain, the formidable Redgauntlet,\r\nthe mortal enemy of the House of Baliol, was within two lances\' length\r\nof the fugitive Edward Baliol, in a narrow pass, when a youth, one of\r\nthe last who attended the usurper in his flight, threw himself\r\nbetween them, received the shock of the pursuer, and was unhorsed and\r\noverthrown. The helmet rolled from his head, and the beams of the sun,\r\nthen rising over the Solway, showed Redgauntlet the features of his\r\ndisobedient son, in the livery, and wearing the cognizance, of the\r\nusurper.\r\n\r\n\'Redgauntlet beheld his son lying before his horse\'s feet; but he also\r\nsaw Baliol, the usurper of the Scottish crown, still, as it seemed,\r\nwithin his grasp, and separated from him only by the prostrate body of\r\nhis overthrown adherent. Without pausing to inquire whether young Edward\r\nwas wounded, he dashed his spurs into his horse, meaning to leap over\r\nhim, but was unhappily frustrated in his purpose. The steed made indeed\r\na bound forward, but was unable to clear the body of the youth, and\r\nwith its hind foot struck him in the forehead, as he was in the act of\r\nrising. The blow was mortal. It is needless to add, that the pursuit was\r\nchecked, and Baliol escaped.\r\n\r\n\'Redgauntlet, ferocious as he is described, was yet overwhelmed with the\r\nthoughts of the crime he had committed. When he returned to his castle,\r\nit was to encounter new domestic sorrows. His wife had been prematurely\r\nseized with the pangs of labour upon hearing the dreadful catastrophe\r\nwhich had taken place. The birth of an infant boy cost her her life.\r\nRedgauntlet sat by her corpse for more than twenty-four hours without\r\nchanging either feature or posture, so far as his terrified domestics\r\ncould observe. The Abbot of Dundrennan preached consolation to him in\r\nvain. Douglas, who came to visit in his affliction a patriot of such\r\ndistinguished zeal, was more successful in rousing his attention. He\r\ncaused the trumpets to sound an English point of war in the courtyard,\r\nand Redgauntlet at once sprang to his arms, and seemed restored to the\r\nrecollection which had been lost in the extent of his misery.\r\n\r\n\'From that moment, whatever he might feel inwardly, he gave way to no\r\noutward emotion. Douglas caused his infant to be brought; but even the\r\niron-hearted soldiers were struck with horror to observe that, by the\r\nmysterious law of nature, the cause of his mother\'s death, and the\r\nevidence of his father\'s guilt, was stamped on the innocent face of the\r\nbabe, whose brow was distinctly marked by the miniature resemblance of a\r\nhorseshoe. Redgauntlet himself pointed it out to Douglas, saying, with a\r\nghastly smile, "It should have been bloody."\r\n\r\n\'Moved, as he was, to compassion for his brother-in-arms, and steeled\r\nagainst all softer feelings by the habits of civil war, Douglas\r\nshuddered at this sight, and displayed a desire to leave the house which\r\nwas doomed to be the scene of such horrors. As his parting advice, he\r\nexhorted Alberick Redgauntlet to make a pilgrimage to Saint Ninian\'s of\r\nWhiteherne, then esteemed a shrine of great sanctity; and departed with\r\na precipitation which might have aggravated, had that been possible,\r\nthe forlorn state of his unhappy friend. But that seems to have been\r\nincapable of admitting any addition. Sir Alberick caused the bodies\r\nof his slaughtered son and the mother to be laid side by side in the\r\nancient chapel of his house, after he had used the skill of a celebrated\r\nsurgeon of that time to embalm them; and it was said that for many weeks\r\nhe spent; some hours nightly in the vault where they reposed.\r\n\r\n\'At length he undertook the proposed pilgrimage to Whiteherne, where\r\nhe confessed himself for the first time since his misfortune, and was\r\nshrived by an aged monk, who afterwards died in the odour of sanctity.\r\nIt is said that it was then foretold to the Redgauntlet, that on account\r\nof his unshaken patriotism his family should continue to be powerful\r\namid the changes of future times; but that, in detestation of his\r\nunrelenting cruelty to his own issue, Heaven had decreed that the valour\r\nof his race should always be fruitless, and that the cause which they\r\nespoused should never prosper.\r\n\r\n\'Submitting to such penance as was there imposed, Sir Alberick went,\r\nit is thought, on a pilgrimage either to Rome, or to the Holy Sepulchre\r\nitself. He was universally considered as dead; and it was not till\r\nthirteen years afterwards, that in the great battle of Durham, fought\r\nbetween David Bruce and Queen Philippa of England, a knight, bearing\r\na horseshoe for his crest, appeared in the van of the Scottish army,\r\ndistinguishing himself by his reckless and desperate valour; who being\r\nat length overpowered and slain, was finally discovered to be the brave\r\nand unhappy Sir Alberick Redgauntlet.\'\r\n\r\n\'And has the fatal sign,\' said I, when Herries had ended his narrative,\r\n\'descended on all the posterity of this unhappy house?\'\r\n\r\n\'It has been so handed down from antiquity, and is still believed,\' said\r\nHerries. \'But perhaps there is, in the popular evidence, something of\r\nthat fancy which creates what it sees. Certainly, as other families have\r\npeculiarities by which they are distinguished, this of Redgauntlet is\r\nmarked in most individuals by a singular indenture of the forehead,\r\nsupposed to be derived from the son of Alberick, their ancestor, and\r\nbrother to the unfortunate Edward, who had perished in so piteous a\r\nmanner. It is certain there seems to have been a fate upon the House of\r\nRedgauntlet, which has been on the losing side in almost all the civil\r\nbroils which have divided the kingdom of Scotland from David Bruce\'s\r\ndays, till the late valiant and unsuccessful attempt of the Chevalier\r\nCharles Edward.\'\r\n\r\nHe concluded with a deep sigh, as one whom the subject had involved in a\r\ntrain of painful reflections.\r\n\r\n\'And am I then,\' I exclaimed, \'descended from this unhappy race? Do you\r\nbelong to it? And if so, why do I sustain restraint and hard usage at\r\nthe hands of a relation?\'\r\n\r\n\'Inquire no further for the present,\' he said. \'The line of conduct\r\nwhich I am pursuing towards you is dictated, not by choice but by\r\nnecessity. You were withdrawn from the bosom of your family and the\r\ncare of your legal guardian, by the timidity and ignorance of a doting\r\nmother, who was incapable of estimating the arguments or feelings of\r\nthose who prefer honour and principle to fortune, and even to life. The\r\nyoung hawk, accustomed only to the fostering care of its dam, must be\r\ntamed by darkness and sleeplessness, ere it is trusted on the wing for\r\nthe purposes of the falconer.\'\r\n\r\nI was appalled at this declaration, which seemed to threaten a long\r\ncontinuance, and a dangerous termination, of my captivity. I deemed it\r\nbest, however, to show some spirit, and at the same time to mingle a\r\ntone of conciliation. \'Mr. Herries,\' I said \'(if I call you rightly by\r\nthat name), let us speak upon this matter without the tone of mystery\r\nand fear in which you seem inclined to envelop it. I have been long,\r\nalas! deprived of the care of that affectionate mother to whom you\r\nallude--long under the charge of strangers--and compelled to form my\r\nown resolutions upon the reasoning of my own mind. Misfortune--early\r\ndeprivation--has given me the privilege of acting for myself; and\r\nconstraint shall not deprive me of an Englishman\'s best privilege.\'\r\n\r\n\'The true cant of the day,\' said Herries, in a tone of scorn. \'The\r\nprivilege of free action belongs to no mortal--we are tied down by\r\nthe fetters of duty--our mortal path is limited by the regulations\r\nof honour--our most indifferent actions are but meshes of the web of\r\ndestiny by which we are all surrounded.\'\r\n\r\nHe paced the room rapidly, and proceeded in a tone of enthusiasm\r\nwhich, joined to some other parts of his conduct, seems to intimate an\r\nover-excited imagination, were it not contradicted by the general tenor\r\nof his speech and conduct.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' he said, in an earnest yet melancholy voice--\'nothing is the\r\nwork of chance--nothing is the consequence of free-will--the liberty of\r\nwhich the Englishman boasts gives as little real freedom to its owner as\r\nthe despotism, of an Eastern sultan permits to his slave. The usurper,\r\nWilliam of Nassau, went forth to hunt, and thought, doubtless, that it\r\nwas by an act of his own royal pleasure that the horse of his murdered\r\nvictim was prepared for his kingly sport. But Heaven had other views;\r\nand before the sun was high, a stumble of that very animal over an\r\nobstacle so inconsiderable as a mole-hillock, cost the haughty rider\r\nhis life and his usurped crown, Do you think an inclination of the rein\r\ncould have avoided that trifling impediment? I tell you, it crossed his\r\nway as inevitably as all the long chain of Caucasus could have done.\r\nYes, young man, in doing and suffering, we play but the part allotted by\r\nDestiny, the manager of this strange drama, stand bound to act no more\r\nthan is prescribed, to say no more than is set down for us; and yet we\r\nmouth about free-will and freedom of thought and action, as if Richard\r\nmust not die, or Richmond conquer, exactly where the Author has decreed\r\nit shall be so!\'\r\n\r\nHe continued to pace the room after this speech, with folded arms and\r\ndowncast looks; and the sound of his steps and tone of his voice brought\r\nto my remembrance, that I had heard this singular person, when I met him\r\non a former occasion, uttering such soliloquies in his solitary chamber.\r\nI observed that, like other Jacobites, in his inveteracy against the\r\nmemory of King William, he had adopted the party opinion, that the\r\nmonarch, on the day he had his fatal accident, rode upon a horse once\r\nthe property of the unfortunate Sir John Friend, executed for high\r\ntreason in 1698.\r\n\r\nIt was not my business to aggravate, but, if possible, rather to soothe\r\nhim in whose power I was so singularly placed. When I conceived that the\r\nkeenness of his feelings had in some degree subsided, I answered him\r\nas follows:--\'I will not--indeed I feel myself incompetent to argue\r\na question of such metaphysical subtlety, as that which involves the\r\nlimits betwixt free-will and predestination. Let us hope we may live\r\nhonestly and die hopefully, without being obliged to form a decided\r\nopinion upon a point so far beyond our comprehension.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wisely resolved,\' he interrupted, with a sneer--\'there came a note from\r\nsome Geneva, sermon.\'\r\n\r\n\'But,\' I proceeded, \'I call your attention to the fact that I, as well\r\nas you, am acted upon by impulses, the result either of my own free\r\nwill, or the consequences of the part which is assigned to me by\r\ndestiny. These may be--nay, at present they are--in direct contradiction\r\nto those by which you are actuated; and how shall we decide which\r\nshall have precedence?--YOU perhaps feel yourself destined to act as my\r\njailer. I feel myself, on the contrary, destined to attempt and effect\r\nmy escape. One of us must be wrong, but who can say which errs till the\r\nevent has decided betwixt us?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall feel myself destined to have recourse to severe modes of\r\nrestraint,\' said he, in the same tone of half jest, half earnest which I\r\nhad used.\r\n\r\n\'In that case,\' I answered, \'it will be my destiny to attempt everything\r\nfor my freedom.\'\r\n\r\n\'And it may be mine, young man,\' he replied, in a deep and stern tone,\r\n\'to take care that you should rather die than attain your purpose.\'\r\n\r\nThis was speaking out indeed, and I did not allow him to go unanswered.\r\n\'You threaten me in vain,\' said I; \'the laws of my country will protect\r\nme; or whom they cannot protect, they will avenge.\'\r\n\r\nI spoke this firmly, and he seemed for a moment silenced; and the scorn\r\nwith which he at last answered me, had something of affectation in it.\r\n\r\n\'The laws!\' he said; \'and what, stripling, do you know of the laws of\r\nyour country? Could you learn jurisprudence under a base-born blotter\r\nof parchment, such as Saunders Fairford; or from the empty pedantic\r\ncoxcomb, his son, who now, forsooth, writer himself advocate? When\r\nScotland was herself, and had her own king and legislature, such\r\nplebeian cubs, instead of being called to the bar of her supreme courts,\r\nwould scarce have been admitted to the honour of bearing a sheepskin\r\nprocess-bag.\'\r\n\r\nAlan, I could not bear this, but answered indignantly, that he knew not\r\nthe worth and honour from which he was detracting.\r\n\r\n\'I know as much of these Fairfords as I do of you,\' he replied.\r\n\r\n\'As much,\' said I, \'and as little; for you can neither estimate their\r\nreal worth nor mine. I know you saw them when last in Edinburgh.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha!\' he exclaimed, and turned on me an inquisitive look.\r\n\r\n\'It is true,\' said I; \'you cannot deny it; and having thus shown you\r\nthat I know something of your motions, let me warn you I have modes of\r\ncommunication with which you are not acquainted. Oblige me not to use\r\nthem to your prejudice.\'\r\n\r\n\'Prejudice me!\' he replied. \'Young man, I smile at, and forgive your\r\nfolly. Nay, I will tell you that of which you are not aware, namely,\r\nthat it was from letters received from these Fairfords that I first\r\nsuspected, what the result of my visit to them confirmed, that you were\r\nthe person whom I had sought for years.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you learned this,\' said I, \'from the papers which were about my\r\nperson on the night when I was under the necessity of becoming your\r\nguest at Brokenburn, I do not envy your indifference to the means of\r\nacquiring information. It was dishonourable to\'--\r\n\r\n\'Peace, young man,\' said Herries, more calmly than I might have\r\nexpected; \'the word dishonour must not be mentioned as in conjunction\r\nwith my name. Your pocket-book was in the pocket of your coat, and did\r\nnot escape the curiosity of another, though it would have been sacred\r\nfrom mine, My servant, Cristal Nixon, brought me the intelligence after\r\nyou were gone. I was displeased with the manner in which he had acquired\r\nhis information; but it was not the less my duty to ascertain its truth,\r\nand for that purpose I went to Edinburgh. I was in hopes to persuade\r\nMr. Fairford to have entered into my views; but I found him too much\r\nprejudiced to permit me to trust him. He is a wretched, yet a timid\r\nslave of the present government, under which our unhappy country is\r\ndishonourably enthralled; and it would have been altogether unfit and\r\nunsafe to have entrusted him with the secret either of the right which\r\nI possess to direct your actions, or of the manner in which I purpose to\r\nexercise it.\'\r\n\r\nI was determined to take advantage of his communicative humour, and\r\nobtain, if possible, more light upon his purpose. He seemed most\r\naccessible to being piqued on the point of honour, and I resolved to\r\navail myself, but with caution, of his sensibility upon that topic. \'You\r\nsay,\' I replied, \'that you are not friendly to indirect practices, and\r\ndisapprove of the means by which your domestic obtained information\r\nof my name and quality--Is it honourable to avail yourself of that\r\nknowledge which is dishonourably obtained?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is boldly asked,\' he replied; \'but, within certain necessary\r\nlimits, I dislike not boldness of expostulation. You have, in this short\r\nconference, displayed more character and energy than I was prepared to\r\nexpect. You will, I trust, resemble a forest plant, which has indeed,\r\nby some accident, been brought up in the greenhouse, and thus rendered\r\ndelicate and effeminate, but which regains its native firmness and\r\ntenacity when exposed for a season to the winter air. I will answer\r\nyour question plainly. In business, as in war, spies and informers are\r\nnecessary evils, which all good men detest; but which yet all prudent\r\nmen must use, unless they mean to fight and act blindfold. But nothing\r\ncan justify the use of falsehood and treachery in our own person.\'\r\n\r\n\'You said to the elder Mr. Fairford,\' continued I, with the same\r\nboldness, which I began to find was my best game, \'that I was the son of\r\nRalph Latimer of Langcote Hall? How do you reconcile this with your late\r\nassertion that my name is not Latimer?\'\r\n\r\nHe coloured as he replied, \'The doting old fool lied; or perhaps mistook\r\nmy meaning. I said, that gentleman might be your father. To say truth,\r\nI wished you to visit England, your native country; because, when you\r\nmight do so, my rights over you would revive.\'\r\n\r\nThis speech fully led me to understand a caution which had been often\r\nimpressed upon me, that, if I regarded my safety, I should not cross\r\nthe southern Border; and I cursed my own folly, which kept me fluttering\r\nlike a moth around the candle, until I was betrayed into the calamity\r\nwith which I had dallied. \'What are those rights,\' I said, \'which you\r\nclaim over me? To what end do you propose to turn them?\'\r\n\r\n\'To a weighty one, you may be certain,\' answered Mr. Herries; \'but I do\r\nnot, at present, mean to communicate to you either its nature or extent.\r\nYou may judge of its importance, when, in order entirely to possess\r\nmyself of your person, I condescended to mix myself with the fellows who\r\ndestroyed the fishing station of yon wretched Quaker. That I held him in\r\ncontempt, and was displeased at the greedy devices with which he ruined\r\na manly sport, is true enough; but, unless as it favoured my designs on\r\nyou, he might have, for me, maintained his stake-nets till Solway should\r\ncease to ebb and flow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Alas!\' I said, \'it doubles my regret to have been the unwilling cause\r\nof misfortune to an honest and friendly man.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do not grieve for that,\' said Herries; \'honest Joshua is one of\r\nthose who, by dint of long prayers, can possess themselves of widow\'s\r\nhouses--he will quickly repair his losses. When he sustains any mishap,\r\nhe and the other canters set it down as a debt against Heaven, and, by\r\nway of set-off, practise rogueries without compunction, till the they\r\nmake the balance even, or incline it to the winning side. Enough of this\r\nfor the present.--I must immediately shift my quarters; for, although I\r\ndo not fear the over-zeal of Mr. Justice Foxley or his clerk will\r\nlead them to any extreme measure, yet that mad scoundrel\'s unhappy\r\nrecognition of me may make it more serious for them to connive at me,\r\nand I must not put their patience to an over severe trial. You must\r\nprepare to attend me, either as a captive or a companion; if as the\r\nlatter, you must give your parole of honour to attempt no escape. Should\r\nyou be so ill advised as to break your word once pledged, be assured\r\nthat I will blow your brains out without a moment\'s scruple.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am ignorant of your plans and purposes,\' I replied, \'and cannot but\r\nhold them dangerous. I do not mean to aggravate my present situation by\r\nany unavailing resistance to the superior force which detains me; but\r\nI will not renounce the right of asserting my natural freedom should it\r\nfavourable opportunity occur. I will, therefore, rather be your prisoner\r\nthan your confederate.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is spoken fairly,\' he said; \'and yet not without the canny caution\r\nof one brought up in the Gude Town of Edinburgh. On my part, I will\r\nimpose no unnecessary hardship upon you; but, on the contrary, your\r\njourney shall be made as easy as is consistent with your being kept\r\nsafely. Do you feel strong enough to ride on horseback as yet, or would\r\nyou prefer a carriage? The former mode of travelling is best adapted to\r\nthe country through which we are to travel, but you are at liberty to\r\nchoose between them.\'\r\n\r\nI said, \'I felt my strength gradually returning, and that I should much\r\nprefer travelling on horseback. A carriage,\' I added, \'is so close\'--\r\n\r\n\'And so easily guarded,\' replied Herries, with a look as if he would\r\nhave penetrated my very thoughts,--\'that, doubtless, you think horseback\r\nbetter calculated for an escape.\'\r\n\r\n\'My thoughts are my own,\' I answered; \'and though you keep my person\r\nprisoner, these are beyond your control.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I can read the book,\' he said, \'without opening the leaves. But I\r\nwould recommend to you to make no rash attempt, and it will be my\r\ncare to see that you have no power to make any that is likely to\r\nbe effectual. Linen, and all other necessaries for one in your\r\ncircumstances, are amply provided, Cristal Nixon will act as your\r\nvalet,--I should rather, perhaps, say, your FEMME DE CHAMBRE. Your\r\ntravelling dress you may perhaps consider as singular; but it is such\r\nas the circumstances require; and, if you object to use the articles\r\nprepared for your use, your mode of journeying will be as personally\r\nunpleasant as that which conducted you hither.--Adieu--We now know each\r\nother better than we did--it will not be my fault if the consequences of\r\nfurther intimacy be not a more favourable mutual opinion.\'\r\n\r\nHe then left me, with a civil good night, to my own reflections,\r\nand only turned back to say that we should proceed on our journey\r\nat daybreak next morning, at furthest; perhaps earlier, he said; but\r\ncomplimented me by supposing that, as I was a sportsman, I must always\r\nbe ready for a sudden start.\r\n\r\nWe are then at issue, this singular man and myself. His personal views\r\nare to a certain point explained. He has chosen an antiquated and\r\ndesperate line of politics, and he claims, from some pretended tie of\r\nguardianship or relationship, which he does not deign to explain but\r\nwhich he seems to have been able to pass current on a silly country\r\nJustice and his knavish clerk, a right to direct and to control my\r\nmotions. The danger which awaited me in England, and which I might have\r\nescaped had I remained in Scotland, was doubtless occasioned by the\r\nauthority of this man. But what my poor mother might fear for me as a\r\nchild--what my English friend, Samuel Griffiths, endeavoured to guard\r\nagainst during my youth and nonage, is now, it seems, come upon me;\r\nand, under a legal pretext, I am detained in what must be a most illegal\r\nmanner, by a person, foe, whose own political immunities have been\r\nforfeited by his conduct. It matters not--my mind is made up neither\r\npersuasion nor threats shall force me into the desperate designs which\r\nthis man meditates. Whether I am of the trifling consequence which my\r\nlife hitherto seems to intimate, or whether I have (as would appear from\r\nmy adversary\'s conduct) such importance, by birth or fortune, as may\r\nmake me a desirable acquisition to a political faction, my resolution\r\nis taken in either case. Those who read this journal, if it shall be\r\nperused by impartial eyes, shall judge of me truly; and if they consider\r\nme as a fool in encountering danger unnecessarily, they shall have no\r\nreason to believe me a coward or a turncoat, when I find myself engaged\r\nin it. I have been bred in sentiments of attachment to the family on the\r\nthrone and in these sentiments I will live and die. I have, indeed, some\r\nidea that Mr. Herries has already discovered that I am made of different\r\nand more unmalleable metal than he had at first believed. There were\r\nletters from my dear Alan Fairford, giving a ludicrous account of my\r\ninstability of temper, in the same pocket-book, which, according to the\r\nadmission of my pretended guardian, fell under the investigation of\r\nhis domestic during the night I passed at Brokenburn, where, as I now\r\nrecollect, my wet clothes, with the contents of my pockets, were, with\r\nthe thoughtlessness of a young traveller, committed too rashly to the\r\ncare of a strange servant. And my kind friend and hospitable landlord,\r\nMr. Alexander Fairford, may also, and with justice, have spoken of my\r\nlevities to this man. But he shall find he has made a false estimate\r\nupon these plausible grounds, since--\r\n\r\nI must break off for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLATIMER\'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION\r\n\r\nThere is at length a halt--at length I have gained so much privacy as to\r\nenable me to continue my journal. It has become a sort of task of duty\r\nto me, without the discharge of which I do not feel that the business\r\nof the day is performed. True, no friendly eye may ever look upon these\r\nlabours, which have amused the solitary hours of an unhappy prisoner.\r\nYet, in the meanwhile, the exercise of the pen seems to act as a\r\nsedative upon my own agitated thoughts and tumultuous passions. I never\r\nlay it down but I rise stronger in resolution, more ardent in hope. A\r\nthousand vague fears, wild expectations, and indigested schemes,\r\nhurry through one\'s thoughts in seasons of doubt and of danger. But by\r\narresting them as they flit across the mind, by throwing them on paper,\r\nand even by that mechanical act compelling ourselves to consider them\r\nwith scrupulous and minute attention, we may perhaps escape becoming the\r\ndupes of our own excited imagination; just as a young horse is cured of\r\nthe vice of starting by being made to stand still and look for some time\r\nwithout any interruption at the cause of its terror.\r\n\r\nThere remains but one risk, which is that of discovery. But besides the\r\nsmall characters, in which my residence in Mr. Fairford\'s house enabled\r\nme to excel, for the purpose of transferring as many scroll sheets as\r\npossible to a huge sheet of stamped paper, I have, as I have elsewhere\r\nintimated, had hitherto the comfortable reflection that if the record\r\nof my misfortunes should fall into the hands of him by whom they are\r\ncaused, they would, without harming any one, show him the real character\r\nand disposition of the person who has become his prisoner--perhaps his\r\nvictim. Now, however, that other names, and other characters, are to be\r\nmingled with the register of my own sentiments, I must take additional\r\ncare of these papers, and keep them in such a manner that, in case\r\nof the least hazard of detection, I may be able to destroy them at a\r\nmoment\'s notice. I shall not soon or easily forget the lesson I have\r\nbeen taught, by the prying disposition which Cristal Nixon, this man\'s\r\nagent and confederate, manifested at Brokenburn, and which proved the\r\noriginal cause of my sufferings.\r\n\r\nMy laying aside the last sheet of my journal hastily was occasioned by\r\nthe unwonted sound of a violin, in the farmyard beneath my windows. It\r\nwill not appear surprising to those who have made music their study,\r\nthat, after listening to a few notes, I became at once assured that the\r\nmusician was no other than the itinerant, formerly mentioned as present\r\nat the destruction of Joshua Geddes\'s stake-nets, the superior delicacy\r\nand force of whose execution would enable me to swear to his bow amongst\r\na whole orchestra. I had the less reason to doubt his identity, because\r\nhe played twice over the beautiful Scottish air called Wandering Willie;\r\nand I could not help concluding that he did so for the purpose of\r\nintimating his own presence, since what the French called the nom de\r\nguerre of the performer was described by the tune.\r\n\r\nHope will catch at the most feeble twig for support in extremity. I knew\r\nthis man, though deprived of sight, to be bold, ingenious, and perfectly\r\ncapable of acting as a guide. I believed I had won his goodwill,\r\nby having, in a frolic, assumed the character of his partner; and I\r\nremembered that in a wild, wandering, and disorderly course of life,\r\nmen, as they become loosened from the ordinary bonds of civil society,\r\nhold those of comradeship more closely sacred; so that honour is\r\nsometimes found among thieves, and faith and attachment in such as the\r\nlaw has termed vagrants. The history of Richard Coeur de Lion and his\r\nminstrel, Blondel, rushed, at the same time, on my mind, though I\r\ncould not even then suppress a smile at the dignity of the example when\r\napplied to a blind fiddler and myself. Still there was something in all\r\nthis to awaken a hope that, if I could open a correspondence with\r\nthis poor violer, he might be useful in extricating me from my present\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nHis profession furnished me with some hope that this desired\r\ncommunication might be attained; since it is well known that, in\r\nScotland, where there is so much national music, the words and airs\r\nof which are generally known, there is a kind of freemasonry amongst\r\nperformers, by which they can, by the mere choice of a tune, express\r\na great deal to the hearers. Personal allusions are often made in this\r\nmanner, with much point and pleasantry; and nothing is more usual at\r\npublic festivals, than that the air played to accompany a particular\r\nhealth or toast, is made the vehicle of compliment, of wit, and\r\nsometimes of satire. [Every one must remember instances of this festive\r\ncustom, in which the adaptation of the tune to the toast was remarkably\r\nfelicitous. Old Neil Gow, and his son Nathaniel, were peculiarly happy\r\non such occasions.]\r\n\r\nWhile these things passed through my mind rapidly, I heard my friend\r\nbeneath recommence, for the third time, the air from which his own\r\nname had been probably adopted, when he was interrupted by his rustic\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\n\'If thou canst play no other spring but that, mon, ho hadst best put up\r\nho\'s pipes and be jogging. Squoire will be back anon, or Master Nixon,\r\nand we\'ll see who will pay poiper then.\'\r\n\r\nOho, thought I, if I have no sharper ears than those of my friends Jan\r\nand Dorcas to encounter, I may venture an experiment upon them; and, as\r\nmost expressive of my state of captivity, I sang two or three lines of\r\nthe 137th Psalm--\r\n\r\n  By Babel\'s streams we sat and wept.\r\n\r\nThe country people listened with attention, and when I ceased, I heard\r\nthem whisper together in tones of commiseration, \'Lack-a-day, poor soul!\r\nso pretty a man to be beside his wits!\'\r\n\r\n\'An he be that gate,\' said Wandering Willie, in a tone calculated to\r\nreach my ears, \'I ken naething will raise his spirits like a spring.\'\r\nAnd he struck up, with great vigour and spirit, the lively Scottish air,\r\nthe words of which instantly occurred to me--\r\n\r\n  Oh whistle and I\'ll come t\'ye, my lad,\r\n  Oh whistle and I\'ll come t\'ye, my lad;\r\n  Though father and mother and a\' should gae mad,\r\n  Oh whistle and I\'ll come t\'ye, my lad.\r\n\r\nI soon heard a clattering noise of feet in the courtyard, which I\r\nconcluded to be Jan and Dorcas dancing a jig in their Cumberland wooden\r\nclogs. Under cover of this din, I endeavoured to answer Willie\'s signal\r\nby whistling, as loud as I could---\r\n\r\n  Come back again and loe me\r\n  When a\' the lave are gane.\r\n\r\nHe instantly threw the dancers out, by changing his air to\r\n\r\n  There\'s my thumb, I\'ll ne\'er beguile thee.\r\n\r\nI no longer doubted that a communication betwixt us was happily\r\nestablished, and that, if I had an opportunity of speaking to the poor\r\nmusician, I should find him willing to take my letter to the post,\r\nto invoke the assistance of some active magistrate, or of the\r\ncommanding-officer of Carlisle Castle, or, in short, to do whatever\r\nelse I could point out, in the compass of his power, to contribute to\r\nmy liberation. But to obtain speech of him, I must have run the risk\r\nof alarming the suspicions of Dorcas, if not of her yet more stupid\r\nCorydon. My ally\'s blindness prevented his receiving any communication\r\nby signs from the window--even if I could have ventured to make\r\nthem, consistently with prudence--so that notwithstanding the mode of\r\nintercourse we had adopted was both circuitous and peculiarly liable to\r\nmisapprehension, I saw nothing I could do better than to continue it,\r\ntrusting my own and my correspondent\'s acuteness in applying to the airs\r\nthe meaning they were intended to convey. I thought of singing the words\r\nthemselves of some significant song, but feared I might, by doing so,\r\nattract suspicion. I endeavoured, therefore, to intimate my speedy\r\ndeparture from my present place of residence, by whistling the\r\nwell-known air with which festive parties in Scotland usually conclude\r\nthe dance:--\r\n\r\n  Good night and joy be wi\' ye a\',\r\n  For here nae langer maun I stay;\r\n  There\'s neither friend nor foe, of mine\r\n  But wishes that I were away.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Willie\'s powers of intelligence were much more active\r\nthan mine, and that, like a deaf person accustomed to be spoken to by\r\nsigns, he comprehended, from the very first notes, the whole meaning I\r\nintended to convey; and he accompanied me in the air with his violin,\r\nin such a manner as at once to show he understood my meaning, and to\r\nprevent my whistling from being attended to.\r\n\r\nHis reply was almost immediate, and was conveyed in the old martial air\r\nof \'Hey, Johnnie lad, cock up your beaver.\' I ran over the words, and\r\nfixed on the following stanza, as most applicable to my circumstances:--\r\n\r\n  Cock up your beaver, and cock it fu\' sprush;\r\n  We\'ll over the Border and give them a brush;\r\n  There\'s somebody there we\'ll teach better behaviour,\r\n  Hey, Johnnie lad, cock up your beaver.\r\n\r\nIf these sounds alluded, as I hope they do, to the chance of assistance\r\nfrom my Scottish friends, I may indeed consider that a door is open to\r\nhope and freedom. I immediately replied with:--\r\n\r\n  My heart\'s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;\r\n  My heart\'s in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;\r\n  A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,\r\n  My heart\'s in the Highlands wherever I go.\r\n\r\n  Farewell to the Highlands!  farewell to the North!\r\n  The birth-place of valour, the cradle of worth;\r\n  Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,\r\n  The hills of the Highlands for ever I love.\r\n\r\nWillie instantly played, with a degree of spirit which might have\r\nawakened hope in Despair herself, if Despair could be supposed to\r\nunderstand Scotch music, the fine old Jacobite air,\r\n\r\n  For a\' that, and a\' that,\r\n  And twice as much as a\' that.\r\n\r\nI next endeavoured to intimate my wish to send notice of my condition to\r\nmy friends; and, despairing to find an air sufficiently expressive of my\r\npurpose, I ventured to sing a verse, which, in various forms, occurs so\r\nfrequently in old ballads--\r\n\r\n  Whare will I get a bonny boy\r\n  That will win hose and shoon:\r\n  That will gae down to Durisdeer,\r\n  And bid my merry men come?\r\n\r\nHe drowned the latter part of the verse by playing, with much emphasis,\r\n\r\n  Kind Robin loes me.\r\n\r\nOf this, though I ran over the verses of the song in my mind, I could\r\nmake nothing; and before I could contrive any mode of intimating my\r\nuncertainty, a cry arose in the courtyard that Cristal Nixon was coming.\r\nMy faithful Willie was obliged to retreat; but not before he had half\r\nplayed, half hummed, by way of farewell,\r\n\r\n  Leave thee--leave thee, lad--\r\n  I\'ll never leave thee;\r\n  The stars shall gae withershins\r\n  Ere I will leave thee.\r\n\r\nI am thus, I think, secure of one trusty adherent in my misfortunes;\r\nand, however whimsical it may be to rely much on a man of his idle\r\nprofession and deprived of sight withal, it is deeply impressed on\r\nmy mind that his services may be both useful and necessary. There\r\nis another quarter from which I look for succour, and which I have\r\nindicated to thee, Alan, in more than one passage of my journal. Twice,\r\nat the early hour of daybreak, I have seen the individual alluded to in\r\nthe court of the farm, and twice she made signs of recognition in\r\nanswer to the gestures by which I endeavoured to make her comprehend my\r\nsituation; but on both occasions she pressed her finger on her lips, as\r\nexpressive of silence and secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which G.M. entered upon the scene for the first time,\r\nseems to assure me of her goodwill, so far as her power may reach; and I\r\nhave many reasons to believe it is considerable. Yet she seemed hurried\r\nand frightened during the very transitory moments of our interview, and\r\nI think was, upon the last occasion, startled by the entrance of some\r\none into the farmyard, just as she was on the point of addressing me.\r\nYou must not ask whether I am an early riser, since such objects are\r\nonly to be seen at daybreak; and although I have never again seen her,\r\nyet I have reason to think she is not distant. It was but three\r\nnights ago, that, worn out by the uniformity of my confinement, I had\r\nmanifested more symptoms of despondence than I had before exhibited,\r\nwhich I conceive may have attracted the attention of the domestics,\r\nthrough whom the circumstance might transpire. On the next morning, the\r\nfollowing lines lay on my table; but how conveyed there, I cannot tell.\r\nThe hand in which they were written is a beautiful Italian manuscript:--\r\n\r\n  As lords their labourers\' hire delay,\r\n  Fate quits our toil with hopes to come,\r\n  Which, if far short of present pay,\r\n  Still, owns a debt and names a sum.\r\n\r\n  Quit not the pledge, frail sufferer, then,\r\n  Although a distant date be given;\r\n  Despair is treason towards man,\r\n  And blasphemy to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThat these lines were written with the friendly purpose of inducing me\r\nto keep up my spirits, I cannot doubt; and I trust the manner in which I\r\nshall conduct myself may show that the pledge is accepted.\r\n\r\nThe dress is arrived in which it seems to be my self-elected guardian\'s\r\npleasure that I shall travel; and what does it prove to be?--A skirt, or\r\nupper-petticoat of camlet, like those worn by country ladies of moderate\r\nrank when on horseback, with such a riding-mask as they frequently use\r\non journeys to preserve their eyes and complexion from the sun and dust,\r\nand sometimes, it is suspected, to enable then to play off a little\r\ncoquetry. From the gayer mode of employing the mask, however, I suspect\r\nI shall be precluded; for instead of being only pasteboard, covered with\r\nblack velvet, I observe with anxiety that mine is thickened with a plate\r\nof steel, which, like Quixote\'s visor, serves to render it more strong\r\nand durable.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, together with a steel clasp for securing the mask behind\r\nme with a padlock, gave me fearful recollections of the unfortunate\r\nbeing, who, never being permitted to lay aside such a visor, acquired\r\nthe well-known historical epithet of the Man in the Iron Mask. I\r\nhesitated a moment whether I should, so far submit to the acts of\r\noppression designed against me as to assume this disguise, which was,\r\nof course, contrived to aid their purposes. But when I remembered Mr.\r\nHerries\'s threat, that I should be kept close prisoner in a carriage,\r\nunless I assumed the dress which should be appointed for me; and I\r\nconsidered the comparative degree of freedom which I might purchase\r\nby wearing the mask and female dress as easily and advantageously\r\npurchased. Here, therefore, I must pause for the present, and await what\r\nthe morning may bring forth.\r\n\r\n[To carry on the story from the documents before us, we think it proper\r\nhere to drop the journal of the captive Darsie Latimer, and adopt,\r\ninstead, a narrative of the proceedings of Alan Fairford in pursuit of\r\nhis friend, which forms another series in this history.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD\r\n\r\nThe reader ought, by this time, to have formed some idea of the\r\ncharacter of Alan Fairford. He had a warmth of heart which the study\r\nof the law and of the world could not chill, and talents which they had\r\nrendered unusually acute. Deprived of the personal patronage enjoyed by\r\nmost of his contemporaries, who assumed the gown under the protection of\r\ntheir aristocratic alliances and descents, he early saw that he should\r\nhave that to achieve for himself which fell to them as a right of birth.\r\nHe laboured hard in silence and solitude, and his labours were crowned\r\nwith success. But Alan doted on his friend Darsie, even more than he\r\nloved his profession, and, as we have seen, threw everything aside when\r\nhe thought Latimer in danger; forgetting fame and fortune, and hazarding\r\neven the serious displeasure of his father, to rescue him whom he loved\r\nwith an elder brother\'s affection. Darsie, though his parts were more\r\nquick and brilliant than those of his friend, seemed always to the\r\nlatter a being under his peculiar charge, whom he was called upon\r\nto cherish and protect in cases where the youth\'s own experience was\r\nunequal to the exigency; and now, when, the fate of Latimer seeming\r\nworse than doubtful, Alan\'s whole prudence and energy were to be exerted\r\nin his behalf, an adventure which might have seemed perilous to most\r\nyouths of his age had no terrors for him. He was well acquainted with\r\nthe laws of his country, and knew how to appeal to them; and, besides\r\nhis professional confidence, his natural disposition was steady, sedate,\r\npersevering, and undaunted. With these requisites he undertook a quest\r\nwhich, at that time, was not unattended with actual danger, and had much\r\nin it to appal a more timid disposition.\r\n\r\nFairford\'s first inquiry concerning his friend was of the chief\r\nmagistrate of Dumfries, Provost Crosbie, who had sent the information\r\nof Darsie\'s disappearance. On his first application, he thought he\r\ndiscerned in the honest dignitary a desire to get rid of the subject.\r\nThe provost spoke of the riot at the fishing station as an \'outbreak\r\namong those lawless loons the fishermen, which concerned the sheriff,\'\r\nhe said, \'more than us poor town council bodies, that have enough to do\r\nto keep peace within burgh, amongst such a set of commoners as the town\r\nare plagued with.\'\r\n\r\n\'But this is not all, Provost Crosbie,\' said Mr. Alan Fairford; \'A young\r\ngentleman of rank and fortune has disappeared amongst their hands--you\r\nknow him. My father gave him a letter to you--Mr. Darsie Latimer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Lack-a-day, yes! lack-a-day, yes!\' said the provost; \'Mr. Darsie\r\nLatimer--he dined at my house--I hope he is well?\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope so too,\' said Alan, rather indignantly; \'but I desire more\r\ncertainty on that point. You yourself wrote my father that he had\r\ndisappeared.\'\r\n\r\n\'Troth, yes, and that is true,\' said the provost. \'But did he not go\r\nback to his friends in Scotland? it was not natural to think he would\r\nstay here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not unless he is under restraint,\' said Fairford, surprised at the\r\ncoolness with which the provost seemed to take up the matter.\r\n\r\n\'Rely on it, sir,\' said Mr. Crosbie, \'that if he has not returned to his\r\nfriends in Scotland, he must have gone to his friends in England.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will rely on no such thing,\' said Alan; \'if there is law or justice\r\nin Scotland, I will have the thing cleared to the very bottom.\'\r\n\r\n\'Reasonable, reasonable,\' said the provost, \'so far as is possible; but\r\nyou know I have no power beyond the ports of the burgh.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you are in the commission besides, Mr. Crosbie; a justice of peace\r\nfor the county.\'\r\n\r\n\'True, very true--that is,\' said the cautious magistrate, \'I will not\r\nsay but my name may stand on the list, but I cannot remember that I have\r\never qualified.\' [By taking the oaths to government.]\r\n\r\n\'Why, in that case,\' said young Fairford, \'there are ill-natured people\r\nmight doubt your attachment to the Protestant line, Mr. Crosbie.\'\r\n\r\n\'God forbid, Mr. Fairford! I who have done and suffered in the\r\nForty-five. I reckon the Highlandmen did me damage to the amount of\r\n100l. Scots, forby all they ate and drank--no, no, sir, I stand beyond\r\nchallenge; but as for plaguing myself with county business, let them\r\nthat aught the mare shoe the mare. The commissioners of supply would see\r\nmy back broken before they would help me in the burgh\'s work, and all\r\nthe world kens the difference of the weight between public business in\r\nburgh and landward. What are their riots to me? have we not riots enough\r\nof our own?--But I must be getting ready, for the council meets this\r\nforenoon. I am blithe to see your father\'s son on the causeway of our\r\nancient burgh, Mr. Alan Fairford. Were you a twelve-month aulder, we\r\nwould make a burgess of you, man. I hope you will come and dine with\r\nme before you go away. What think you of to-day at two o\'clock--just a\r\nroasted chucky and a drappit egg?\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford resolved that his friend\'s hospitality should not, as it\r\nseemed the inviter intended, put a stop to his queries. \'I must delay\r\nyou for a moment,\' he said, \'Mr. Crosbie; this is a serious affair; a\r\nyoung gentleman of high hopes, my own dearest friend, is missing--you\r\ncannot think it will be passed over slightly, if a man of your high\r\ncharacter and known zeal for the government do not make some active\r\ninquiry. Mr. Crosbie, you are my father\'s friend, and I respect you as\r\nsuch--but to others it will have a bad appearance.\'\r\n\r\nThe withers of the provost were not unwrung; he paced the room in much\r\ntribulation, repeating, \'But what can I do, Mr. Fairford? I warrant\r\nyour friend casts up again--he will come back again, like the ill\r\nshilling--he is not the sort of gear that tynes--a hellicat boy, running\r\nthrough the country with a blind fiddler and playing the fiddle to\r\na parcel of blackguards, who can tell where the like of him may have\r\nscampered to?\'\r\n\r\n\'There are persons apprehended, and in the jail of the town, as I\r\nunderstand from the sheriff-substitute,\' said Mr. Fairford; \'you\r\nmust call them before you, and inquire what they know of this young\r\ngentleman.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye--the sheriff-depute did commit some poor creatures, I\r\nbelieve--wretched ignorant fishermen bodies, that had been quarrelling\r\nwith Quaker Geddes and his stake-nets, whilk, under favour of your gown\r\nbe it spoken, Mr. Fairford, are not over and above lawful, and the town\r\nclerk thinks that they may be lawfully removed VIA FACTI--but that is by\r\nthe by. But, sir, the creatures were a\' dismissed for want of evidence;\r\nthe Quaker would not swear to them, and what could the sheriff and me\r\ndo but just let them loose? Come awa, cheer up, Master Alan, and take a\r\nwalk till dinner-time--I must really go to the council.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stop a moment, provost,\' said Alan; \'I lodge a complaint before you as\r\na magistrate, and you will find it serious to slight it over. You must\r\nhave these men apprehended again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye--easy said; but catch them that can,\' answered the provost;\r\n\'they are ower the march by this time, or by the point of Cairn.--Lord\r\nhelp ye! they are a kind of amphibious deevils, neither land nor water\r\nbeasts neither English nor Scots--neither county nor stewartry, as we\r\nsay--they are dispersed like so much quicksilver. You may as well try to\r\nwhistle a sealgh out of the Solway, as to get hold of one of them till\r\nall the fray is over.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Crosbie, this will not do,\' answered the young counsellor; \'there\r\nis a person of more importance than such wretches as you describe\r\nconcerned in this unhappy business--I must name to you a certain Mr.\r\nHerries.\'\r\n\r\nHe kept his eye on the provost as he uttered the name, which he did\r\nrather at a venture, and from the connexion which that gentleman, and\r\nhis real or supposed niece, seemed to have with the fate of Darsie\r\nLatimer, than from any distinct cause of suspicion which he entertained.\r\nHe thought the provost seemed embarrassed, though he showed much desire\r\nto assume an appearance of indifference, in which he partly succeeded.\r\n\r\n\'Herries!\' he said--\'What Herries?--There are many of that name--not\r\nso many as formerly, for the old stocks are wearing out; but there is\r\nHerries of Heathgill, and Herries of Auchintulloch, and Herries\'--\r\n\r\n\'To save you further trouble, this person\'s designation is Herries of\r\nBirrenswork.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of Birrenswork?\' said Mr. Crosbie; \'I have you now, Mr. Alan. Could you\r\nnot as well have said, the Laird of Redgauntlet?\'\r\n\r\nFairford was too wary to testify any surprise at this identification of\r\nnames, however unexpected. \'I thought,\' said he, \'he was more generally\r\nknown by the name of Herries. I have seen and been in company with him\r\nunder that name, I am sure.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh aye; in Edinburgh, belike. You know Redgauntlet was unfortunate a\r\ngreat while ago, and though he was maybe not deeper in the mire than\r\nother folk, yet, for some reason or other, he did not get so easily\r\nout.\'\r\n\r\n\'He was attainted, I understand; and has no remission,\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\nThe cautious provost only nodded, and said, \'You may guess, therefore,\r\nwhy it is so convenient he should hold his mother\'s name, which is also\r\npartly his own, when he is about Edinburgh. To bear his proper name\r\nmight be accounted a kind of flying in the face of government, ye\r\nunderstand. But he has been long connived at--the story is an old\r\nstory--and the gentleman has many excellent qualities, and is of a very\r\nancient and honourable house--has cousins among the great folk--counts\r\nkin with the advocate and with the sheriff--hawks, you know, Mr. Alan,\r\nwill not pike out hawks\' een--he is widely connected--my wife is a\r\nfourth cousin of Redgauntlet\'s.\'\r\n\r\nHINC ILLAE LACHRYMAE! thought Alan Fairford to himself; but the hint\r\npresently determined him to proceed by soft means and with caution. \'I\r\nbeg you to understand,\' said Fairford, \'that in the investigation I am\r\nabout to make, I design no harm to Mr. Herries, or Redgauntlet--call him\r\nwhat you will. All I wish is, to ascertain the safety of my friend. I\r\nknow that he was rather foolish in once going upon a mere frolic, in\r\ndisguise, to the neighbourhood of this same gentleman\'s house. In his\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Redgauntlet may have misinterpreted the motives, and\r\nconsidered Darsie Latimer as a spy. His influence, I believe, is great\r\namong the disorderly people you spoke of but now?\'\r\n\r\nThe provost answered with another sagacious shake of his head, that\r\nwould have done honour to Lord Burleigh in the CRITIC.\r\n\r\n\'Well, then,\' continued Fairford,\' is it not possible that, in the\r\nmistaken belief that Mr. Latimer was a spy, he may, upon such suspicion,\r\nhave caused him to be carried off and confined somewhere? Such things\r\nare done at elections, and on occasions less pressing than when men\r\nthink their lives are in danger from an informer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Fairford,\' said the provost, very earnestly, \'I scarce think such\r\na mistake possible; or if, by any extraordinary chance, it should have\r\ntaken place, Redgauntlet, whom I cannot but know well, being as I have\r\nsaid my wife\'s first cousin (fourth cousin, I should say) is altogether\r\nincapable of doing anything harsh to the young gentleman--he might send\r\nhim ower to Ailsay for a night or two, or maybe land him on the north\r\ncoast of Ireland, or in Islay, or some of the Hebrides; but depend upon\r\nit, he is incapable of harming a hair of his head.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am determined not to trust to that, provost,\' answered Fairford\r\nfirmly; \'and I am a good deal surprised at your way of talking so\r\nlightly of such an aggression on the liberty of the subject. You are\r\nto consider, and Mr. Herries or Mr. Redgauntlet\'s friends would do very\r\nwell also to consider, how it would sound in the ears of an English\r\nSecretary of State, that an attainted traitor (for such is this\r\ngentleman) has not only ventured to take up his abode in this\r\nrealm--against the king of which he has been in arms--but is suspected\r\nof having proceeded, by open force and violence, against the person\r\nof one of the lieges, a young man who is neither without friends nor\r\nproperty to secure his being righted.\'\r\n\r\nThe provost looked at the young counsellor with a face in which\r\ndistrust, alarm, and vexation seemed mingled. \'A fashious job,\' he said\r\nat last, \'a fashious job; and it will be dangerous meddling with it.\r\nI should like ill to see your father\'s son turn informer against an\r\nunfortunate gentleman.\'\r\n\r\n\'Neither do I mean it,\' answered Alan, \'provided that unfortunate\r\ngentleman and his friends give me a quiet opportunity of securing my\r\nfriend\'s safety. If I could speak with Mr. Redgauntlet, and hear his own\r\nexplanation, I should probably be satisfied. If I am forced, to denounce\r\nhim to government, it will be in his new capacity of a kidnapper. I may\r\nnot be able, nor is it my business, to prevent his being recognized in\r\nhis former character of an attainted person, excepted from the general\r\npardon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Master Fairford,\' said the provost, \'would ye ruin the poor innocent\r\ngentleman on an idle suspicion?\'\r\n\r\n\'Say no more of it, Mr. Crosbie; my line of conduct is\r\ndetermined--unless that suspicion is removed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Weel, sir,\' said the provost, \'since so it be, and since you say that\r\nyou do not seek to harm Redgauntlet personally, I\'ll ask a man to dine\r\nwith us to-day that kens as much about his matters as most folk. You\r\nmust think, Mr. Alan Fairford, though Redgauntlet be my wife\'s near\r\nrelative, and though, doubtless, I wish him weel, yet I am not the\r\nperson who is like to be intrusted with his incomings and outgoings. I\r\nam not a man for that--I keep the kirk, and I abhor Popery--I have stood\r\nup for the House of Hanover, and for liberty and property--I carried\r\narms, sir, against the Pretender, when three of the Highlandmen\'s\r\nbaggage-carts were stopped at Ecclefechan; and I had an especial loss of\r\na hundred pounds\'--\r\n\r\n\'Scots,\' interrupted Fairford. \'You forget you told me all this before.\'\r\n\r\n\'Scots or English, it was too much for me to lose,\' said the provost;\r\nso you see I am not a person to pack or peel with Jacobites, and such\r\nunfreemen as poor Redgauntlet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Granted, granted, Mr. Crosbie; and what then?\' said Alan Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Why, then, it follows, that if I am to help you at this pinch, if\r\ncannot be by and through my ain personal knowledge, but through some\r\nfitting agent or third person.\'\r\n\r\n\'Granted again,\' said Fairford. \'And pray who may this third person be?\'\r\n\r\n\'Wha but Pate Maxwell of Summertrees--him they call Pate-in-Peril.\'\r\n\r\n\'An old Forty-five man, of course?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Ye may swear that,\' replied the provost--\'as black a Jacobite as the\r\nauld leaven can make him; but a sonsy, merry companion, that none of us\r\nthink it worth while to break wi\' for all his brags and his clavers.\r\nYou would have thought, if he had had but his own way at Derby, he would\r\nhave marched Charlie Stuart through between Wade and the Duke, as a\r\nthread goes through the needle\'s ee, and seated him in Saint James\'s\r\nbefore you could have said haud your hand. But though he is a windy body\r\nwhen he gets on his auld-warld stories, he has mair gumption in him than\r\nmost people--knows business, Mr. Alan, being bred to the law; but never\r\ntook the gown, because of the oaths, which kept more folk out then than\r\nthey do now--the more\'s the pity.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! are you sorry, provost, that Jacobitism is upon the decline?\'\r\nsaid Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' answered the provost--\'I am only sorry for folks losing the\r\ntenderness of conscience which they used to have. I have a son breeding\r\nto the bar, Mr. Fairford; and, no doubt, considering my services and\r\nsufferings, I might have looked for some bit postie to him; but if the\r\nmuckle tykes come in--I mean a\' these Maxwells, and Johnstones, and\r\ngreat lairds, that the oaths used to keep out lang syne--the bits o\'\r\nmessan doggies, like my son, and maybe like your father\'s son, Mr. Alan,\r\nwill be sair put to the wall.\'\r\n\r\n\'But to return to the subject, Mr. Crosbie,\' said Fairford, \'do you\r\nreally think it likely that this Mr. Maxwell will be of service in this\r\nmatter?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s very like he may be, for he is the tongue of the trump to the\r\nwhole squad of them,\' said the provost; \'and Redgauntlet, though he will\r\nnot stick at times to call him a fool, takes more of his counsel than\r\nany man\'s else that I am aware of. If Fate can bring him to a communing,\r\nthe business is done. He\'s a sharp chield, Pate-in-Peril.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pate-in-Peril!\' repeated Alan; \'a very singular name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, and it was in as queer a way he got it; but I\'ll say naething\r\nabout that,\' said the provost, \'for fear of forestalling his market;\r\nfor ye are sure to hear it once at least, however oftener, before the\r\npunch-bowl gives place to the teapot.--And now, fare ye weel; for there\r\nis the council-bell clinking in earnest; and if I am not there before it\r\njows in, Bailie Laurie will be trying some of his manoeuvres.\'\r\n\r\nThe provost, repeating his expectation of seeing Mr. Fairford at two\r\no\'clock, at length effected his escape from the young counsellor, and\r\nleft him at a considerable loss how to proceed. The sheriff, it seems,\r\nhad returned to Edinburgh, and he feared to find the visible repugnance\r\nof the provost to interfere with this Laird of Birrenswork, or\r\nRedgauntlet, much stronger amongst the country gentlemen, many of\r\nwhom were Catholics as well as Jacobites, and most others unwilling to\r\nquarrel with kinsmen and friends, by prosecuting with severity political\r\noffences which had almost run a prescription.\r\n\r\nTo collect all the information in his power, and not to have recourse\r\nto the higher authorities until he could give all the light of which\r\nthe case was capable, seemed the wiser proceeding in a choice of\r\ndifficulties. He had some conversation with the procurator-fiscal, who,\r\nas well as the provost, was an old correspondent of his father. Alan\r\nexpressed to that officer a purpose of visiting Brokenburn, but was\r\nassured by him, that it would be a step attended with much danger to his\r\nown person, and altogether fruitless; that the individuals who had\r\nbeen ringleaders in the riot were long since safely sheltered in their\r\nvarious lurking-holes in the Isle of Man, Cumberland, and elsewhere; and\r\nthat those who might remain would undoubtedly commit violence on any\r\nwho visited their settlement with the purpose of inquiring into the late\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nThere were not the same objections to his hastening to Mount Sharon,\r\nwhere he expected to find the latest news of his friend; and there\r\nwas time enough to do so, before the hour appointed for the provost\'s\r\ndinner. Upon the road, he congratulated himself on having obtained one\r\npoint of almost certain information. The person who had in a manner\r\nforced himself upon his father\'s hospitality, and had appeared desirous\r\nto induce Darsie Latimer to visit England, against whom, too, a sort of\r\nwarning had been received from an individual connected with and residing\r\nin his own family, proved to be a promoter of the disturbance in which\r\nDarsie had disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the cause of such an attempt on the liberty of an\r\ninoffensive and amiable man? It was impossible it could be merely owing\r\nto Redgauntlet\'s mistaking Darsie for a spy; for though that was the\r\nsolution which Fairford had offered to the provost, he well knew that,\r\nin point of fact, he himself had been warned by his singular visitor of\r\nsome danger to which his friend was exposed, before such suspicion could\r\nhave been entertained; and the injunctions received by Latimer from his\r\nguardian, or him who acted as such, Mr. Griffiths of London, pointed to\r\nthe same thing. He was rather glad, however, that he had not let Provost\r\nCrosbie into his secret further than was absolutely necessary; since it\r\nwas plain that the connexion of his wife with the suspected party was\r\nlikely to affect his impartiality as a magistrate.\r\n\r\nWhen Alan Fairford arrived at Mount Sharon, Rachel Geddes hastened to\r\nmeet him, almost before the servant could open the door. She drew back\r\nin disappointment when she beheld a stranger, and said, to excuse her\r\nprecipitation, that \'she had thought it was her brother Joshua returned\r\nfrom Cumberland.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Geddes is then absent from home?\' said Fairford, much disappointed\r\nin his turn.\r\n\r\n\'He hath been gone since yesterday, friend,\' answered Rachel, once more\r\ncomposed to the quietude which characterizes her sect, but her pale\r\ncheek and red eye giving contradiction to her assumed equanimity.\r\n\r\n\'I am,\' said Fairford, hastily, \'the particular friend of a young man\r\nnot unknown to you, Miss Geddes--the friend of Darsie Latimer--and\r\nam come hither in the utmost anxiety, having understood from Provost\r\nCrosbie, that he had disappeared in the night when a destructive attack\r\nwas made upon the fishing-station of Mr. Geddes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thou dost afflict me, friend, by thy inquiries,\' said Rachel, more\r\naffected than before; \'for although the youth was like those of the\r\nworldly generation, wise in his own conceit, and lightly to be moved by\r\nthe breath of vanity, yet Joshua loved him, and his heart clave to him\r\nas if he had been his own son. And when he himself escaped from the sons\r\nof Belial, which was not until they had tired themselves with reviling,\r\nand with idle reproach, and the jests of the scoffer, Joshua, my\r\nbrother, returned to them once and again, to give ransom for the\r\nyouth called Darsie Latimer, with offers of money and with promise of\r\nremission, but they would not hearken to him. Also, he went before the\r\nhead judge, whom men call the sheriff, and would have told him of the\r\nyouth\'s peril; but he would in no way hearken to him unless he would\r\nswear unto the truth of his words, which thing he might not do without\r\nsin, seeing it is written, Swear not at all--also, that our conversation\r\nshall be yea or nay. Therefore, Joshua returned to me disconsolate,\r\nand said, "Sister Rachel, this youth hath run into peril for my sake;\r\nassuredly I shall not be guiltless if a hair of his head be harmed,\r\nseeing I have sinned in permitting him to go with me to the fishing\r\nstation when such evil was to be feared. Therefore, I will take my\r\nhorse, even Solomon, and ride swiftly into Cumberland, and I will make\r\nmyself friends with Mammon of Unrighteousness, among the magistrates of\r\nthe Gentiles, and among their mighty men; and it shall come to pass that\r\nDarsie Latimer shall be delivered, even if it were at the expense of\r\nhalf my substance." And I said, "Nay, my brother, go not, for they\r\nwill but scoff at and revile thee; but hire with thy silver one of the\r\nscribes, who are eager as hunters in pursuing their prey, and he shall\r\nfree Darsie Latimer from the men of violence by his cunning, and thy\r\nsoul shall be guiltless of evil towards the lad." But he answered and\r\nsaid, "I will not be controlled in this matter." And he is gone forth\r\nand hath not returned, and I fear me that he may never return; for\r\nthough he be peaceful, as becometh one who holds all violence as offence\r\nagainst his own soul, yet neither the floods of water, nor the fear of\r\nthe snare, nor the drawn sword of the adversary brandished in the path,\r\nwill overcome his purpose. Wherefore the Solway may swallow him up, or\r\nthe sword of the enemy may devour him--nevertheless, my hope is better\r\nin Him who directeth all things, and ruleth over the waves of the sea,\r\nand overruleth the devices of the wicked, and who can redeem us even as\r\na bird from the fowler\'s net.\'\r\n\r\nThis was all that Fairford could learn from Miss Geddes; but he heard\r\nwith pleasure that the good Quaker, her brother, had many friends among\r\nthose of his own profession in Cumberland, and without exposing himself\r\nto so much danger as his sister seemed to apprehend, he trusted he might\r\nbe able to discover some traces of Darsie Latimer. He himself rode back\r\nto Dumfries, having left with Miss Geddes his direction in that\r\nplace, and an earnest request that she would forward thither whatever\r\ninformation she might obtain from her brother.\r\n\r\nOn Fairford\'s return to Dumfries, he employed the brief interval which\r\nremained before dinner-time, in writing an account of what had befallen\r\nLatimer and of the present uncertainty of his condition, to Mr. Samuel\r\nGriffiths, through whose hands the remittances for his friend\'s service\r\nhad been regularly made, desiring he would instantly acquaint him with\r\nsuch parts of his history as might direct him in the search which he\r\nwas about to institute through the border counties, and which he pledged\r\nhimself not; to give up until he had obtained news of his friend, alive\r\nor dead, The young lawyer\'s mind felt easier when he had dispatched this\r\nletter. He could not conceive any reason why his friend\'s life should be\r\naimed at; he knew Darsie had done nothing by which his liberty could\r\nbe legally affected; and although, even of late years, there had been\r\nsingular histories of men, and women also, who had been trepanned,\r\nand concealed in solitudes and distant islands in order to serve some\r\ntemporary purpose, such violences had been chiefly practised by the rich\r\non the poor, and by the strong on the feeble; whereas, in the present\r\ncase, this Mr. Herries, or Redgauntlet, being amenable, for more reasons\r\nthan one, to the censure of the law, must be the weakest in any struggle\r\nin which it could be appealed to. It is true, that his friendly anxiety\r\nwhispered that the very cause which rendered this oppressor less\r\nformidable, might make him more desperate. Still, recalling his\r\nlanguage, so strikingly that of the gentleman, and even of the man\r\nof honour, Alan Fairford concluded, that though, in his feudal pride,\r\nRedgauntlet might venture on the deeds of violence exercised by the\r\naristocracy in other times, he could not be capable of any action of\r\ndeliberate atrocity. And in these convictions he went to dine with\r\nProvost Crosbie, with a heart more at ease than might have been\r\nexpected. [See Note 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED\r\n\r\nFive minutes had elapsed after the town clock struck two, before\r\nAlan Fairford, who had made a small detour to put his letter into the\r\npost-house, reached the mansion of Mr. Provost Crosbie, and was at once\r\ngreeted by the voice of that civic dignitary, and the rural dignitary\r\nhis visitor, as by the voices of men impatient for their dinner.\r\n\r\n\'Come away, Mr. Fairford--the Edinburgh time is later than ours,\' said\r\nthe provost.\r\n\r\nAnd, \'Come away, young gentleman,\' said the laird; \'I remember your\r\nfather weel at the Cross thirty years ago--I reckon you are as late in\r\nEdinburgh as at London, four o\'clock hours--eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not quite so degenerate,\' replied Fairford; \'but certainly many\r\nEdinburgh people are so ill-advised as to postpone their dinner\r\ntill three, that they may have full time to answer their London\r\ncorrespondents.\'\r\n\r\n\'London correspondents!\' said Mr. Maxwell; \'and pray what the devil have\r\nthe people of Auld Reekie to do with London correspondents?\' [Not much\r\nin those days, for within my recollection the London post; was brought\r\nnorth in a small mail-cart; and men are yet as live who recollect when\r\nit came down with only one single letter for Edinburgh, addressed to the\r\nmanager of the British Linen Company.]\r\n\r\n\'The tradesmen must have their goods,\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Can they not buy our own Scottish manufactures, and pick their\r\ncustomers pockets in a more patriotic manner?\'\r\n\r\n\'Then the ladies must have fashions,\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Can they not busk the plaid over their heads, as their mothers did? A\r\ntartan screen, and once a year a new cockernony from Paris, should\r\nserve a countess. But ye have not many of them left, I think--Mareschal,\r\nAirley, Winton, Vemyss, Balmerino, all passed and gone--aye, aye, the\r\ncountesses and ladies of quality will scarce take up too much of your\r\nball-room floor with their quality hoops nowadays.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no want of crowding, however, sir,\' said Fairford; \'they begin\r\nto talk of a new Assembly room.\'\r\n\r\n\'A new Assembly room!\' said the old Jacobite laird--\'Umph--I mind\r\nquartering three hundred men in the old Assembly room [I remember\r\nhearing this identical answer given by an old Highland gentleman of the\r\nForty-Five, when he heard of the opening of the New Assembly Rooms in\r\nGeorge Street.]--But come, come--I\'ll ask no more questions--the answers\r\nall smell of new lords new lands, and do but spoil my appetite, which\r\nwere a pity, since here comes Mrs. Crosbie to say our mutton\'s ready.\'\r\n\r\nIt was even so. Mrs. Crosbie had been absent, like Eve, \'on hospitable\r\ncares intent,\' a duty which she did not conceive herself exempted from,\r\neither by the dignity of her husband\'s rank in the municipality, or the\r\nsplendour of her Brussels silk gown, or even by the more highly prized\r\nlustre of her birth; for she was born a Maxwell, and allied, as her\r\nhusband often informed his friends, to several of the first families in\r\nthe county. She had been handsome, and was still a portly, good-looking\r\nwoman of her years; and though her peep into the kitchen had somewhat\r\nheightened her complexion, it was no more than a modest touch of rouge\r\nmight have done.\r\n\r\nThe provost was certainly proud of his lady, nay, some said he was\r\nafraid of her; for of the females of the Redgauntlet family there went a\r\nrumour, that, ally where they would, there was a grey mare as surely in\r\nthe stables of their husbands, as there is a white horse in Wouvermans\'\r\npictures. The good dame, too, was supposed to have brought a spice of\r\npolitics into Mr. Crosbie\'s household along with her; and the provost\'s\r\nenemies at the council-table of the burgh used to observe that he\r\nuttered there many a bold harangue against the Pretender, and in favour\r\nof King George and government, of which he dared not have pronounced\r\na syllable in his own bedchamber; and that, in fact, his wife\'s\r\npredominating influence had now and then occasioned his acting,\r\nor forbearing to act, in a manner very different from his general\r\nprofessions of zeal for Revolution principles. If this was in any\r\nrespect true, it was certain, on the other hand, that Mrs. Crosbie, in\r\nall external points, seemed to acknowledge the \'lawful sway and right\r\nsupremacy\' of the head of the house, and if she did not in truth\r\nreverence her husband, she at least seemed to do so.\r\n\r\nThis stately dame received Mr. Maxwell (a cousin of course) with\r\ncordiality, and Fairford with civility; answering at the same time with\r\nrespect, to the magisterial complaints of the provost, that dinner was\r\njust coming up. \'But since you changed poor Peter MacAlpin, that used\r\nto take care of the town-clock, my dear, it has never gone well a single\r\nday.\'\r\n\r\n\'Peter MacAlpin, my dear,\' said the provost,\' made himself too busy for\r\na person in office, and drunk healths and so forth, which it became no\r\nman to drink or to pledge, far less one that is in point of office a\r\nservant of the public, I understand that he lost the music bells in\r\nEdinburgh, for playing "Ower the Water to Charlie," upon the tenth of\r\nJune. He is a black sheep, and deserves no encouragement.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a bad tune though, after all,\' said Summertrees; and, turning to\r\nthe window, he half hummed, half whistled, the air in question, then\r\nsang the last verse aloud:\r\n\r\n  \'Oh I loe weel my Charlie\'s name,\r\n    Though some there be that abhor him;\r\n   But oh to see the deil gang hame\r\n    Wi\' a\' the Whigs before him!\r\n   Over the water, and over the sea,\r\n    And over the water to Charlie;\r\n   Come weal, come woe, we\'ll gather and go,\r\n    And live or die with Charlie.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Crosbie smiled furtively on the laird, wearing an aspect at the\r\nsame time of deep submission; while the provost, not choosing to hear\r\nhis visitor\'s ditty, took a turn through the room, in unquestioned\r\ndignity and independence of authority.\r\n\r\n\'Aweel, aweel, my dear,\' said the lady, with a quiet smile of\r\nsubmission, \'ye ken these matters best, and you will do your\r\npleasure--they are far above my hand--only, I doubt if ever the\r\ntown-clock will go right, or your meals be got up so regular as I should\r\nwish, till Peter MacAlpin gets his office back again. The body\'s auld,\r\nand can neither work nor want, but he is the only hand to set a clock.\'\r\n\r\nIt may be noticed in passing, that notwithstanding this prediction,\r\nwhich, probably, the fair Cassandra had the full means of accomplishing,\r\nit was not till the second council day thereafter that the misdemeanours\r\nof the Jacobite clock-keeper were passed over, and he was once more\r\nrestored to his occupation of fixing the town\'s time, and the provost\'s\r\ndinner-hour.\r\n\r\nUpon the present occasion the dinner passed pleasantly away. Summertrees\r\ntalked and jested with the easy indifference of a man who holds himself\r\nsuperior to his company. He was indeed an important person, as was\r\ntestified by his portly appearance; his hat laced with POINT D\'ESPAGNE;\r\nhis coat and waistcoat once richly embroidered, though now almost\r\nthreadbare; the splendour of his solitaire, and laced ruffles, though\r\nthe first was sorely creased, and the other sullied; not to forget the\r\nlength of his silver-hilted rapier. His wit, or rather humour, bordered\r\non the sarcastic, and intimated a discontented man; and although he\r\nshowed no displeasure when the provost attempted a repartee, yet it\r\nseemed that he permitted it upon mere sufferance, as a fencing-master,\r\nengaged with a pupil, will sometimes permit the tyro to hit him, solely\r\nby way of encouragement. The laird\'s own jests, in the meanwhile, were\r\neminently successful, not only with the provost and his lady, but with\r\nthe red-cheeked and red-ribboned servant-maid who waited at table, and\r\nwho could scarce perform her duty with propriety, so effectual were the\r\nexplosions of Summertrees. Alan Fairford alone was unmoved among all\r\nthis mirth; which was the less wonderful, that, besides the important\r\nsubject which occupied his thoughts, most of the laird\'s good things\r\nconsisted in sly allusions to little parochial or family incidents,\r\nwith which the Edinburgh visitor was totally unacquainted: so that the\r\nlaughter of the party sounded in his ear like the idle crackling of\r\nthorns under the pot, with this difference, that they did not accompany\r\nor second any such useful operation as the boiling thereof.\r\n\r\nFairford was glad when the cloth was withdrawn; and when Provost Crosbie\r\n(not without some points of advice from his lady touching the precise\r\nmixture of the ingredients) had accomplished the compounding of a noble\r\nbowl of punch, at which the old Jacobite\'s eyes seemed to glisten, the\r\nglasses were pushed round it, filled, and withdrawn each by its owner,\r\nwhen the provost emphatically named the toast, \'The King,\' with an\r\nimportant look to Fairford, which seemed to say, You can have no doubt\r\nwhom I mean, and therefore there is no occasion to particularize the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nSummertrees repeated the toast, with a sly wink to the lady, while\r\nFairford drank his glass in silence.\r\n\r\n\'Well, young advocate,\' said the landed proprietor, \'I am glad to see\r\nthere is some shame, if there is little honesty, left in the Faculty.\r\nSome of your black gowns, nowadays, have as little of the one as of the\r\nother.\'\r\n\r\n\'At least, sir,\' replied Mr. Fairford, \'I am so much of a lawyer as not\r\nwillingly to enter into disputes which I am not retained to support--it\r\nwould be but throwing away both time and argument.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, come,\' said the lady, \'we will have no argument in this house\r\nabout Whig or Tory--the provost kens what he maun SAY, and I ken what he\r\nshould THINK; and for a\' that has come and gane yet, there may be a time\r\ncoming when honest men may say what they think, whether they be provosts\r\nor not.\'\r\n\r\n\'D\'ye hear that, provost?\' said Summertrees; \'your wife\'s a witch, man;\r\nyou should nail a horseshoe on your chamber door--Ha, ha, ha!\'\r\n\r\nThis sally did not take quite so well as former efforts of the laird\'s\r\nwit. The lady drew up, and the provost said, half aside, \'The sooth\r\nbourd is nae bourd. [The true joke is no joke.] You will find the\r\nhorseshoe hissing hot, Summertrees.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can speak from experience, doubtless, provost,\' answered the\r\nlaird; \'but I crave pardon--I need not tell Mrs. Crosbie that I have all\r\nrespect for the auld and honourable House of Redgauntlet.\'\r\n\r\n\'And good reason ye have, that are sae sib to them,\' quoth the lady,\r\n\'and kend weel baith them that are here, and them that are gane.\'\r\n\r\n\'In troth, and ye may say sae, madam,\' answered the laird; \'for poor\r\nHarry Redgauntlet, that suffered at Carlisle, was hand and glove with\r\nme; and yet we parted on short leave-taking.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, Summertrees,\' said the provost; \'that was when you played\r\nCheat-the-woodie, and gat the by-name of Pate-in-Peril. I wish you would\r\ntell the story to my young friend here. He likes weel to hear of a sharp\r\ntrick, as most lawyers do.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder at your want of circumspection, provost,\' said the\r\nlaird,--much after the manner of a singer when declining to sing the\r\nsong that is quivering upon his tongue\'s very end. \'Ye should mind there\r\nare some auld stories that cannot be ripped up again with entire safety\r\nto all concerned. TACE is Latin for a candle,\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope,\' said the lady, \'you are not afraid of anything being said out\r\nof this house to your prejudice, Summertrees? I have heard the story\r\nbefore; but the oftener I hear it, the more wonderful I think it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, madam; but it has been now a wonder of more than nine days, and it\r\nis time it should be ended,\' answered Maxwell.\r\n\r\nFairford now thought it civil to say, \'that he had often heard of Mr.\r\nMaxwell\'s wonderful escape, and that nothing could be more agreeable to\r\nhim than to hear the right version of it.\'\r\n\r\nBut Summertrees was obdurate, and refused to take up the time of the\r\ncompany with such \'auld-warld nonsense.\'\r\n\r\n\'Weel, weel,\' said the provost, \'a wilful man maun hae his way. What do\r\nyour folk in the country think about the disturbances that are beginning\r\nto spunk out in the colonies?\'\r\n\r\n\'Excellent, sir, excellent. When things come to the worst; they will\r\nmend; and to the worst they are coming. But as to that nonsense ploy\r\nof mine, if ye insist on hearing the particulars,\'--said the laird, who\r\nbegan to be sensible that the period of telling his story gracefully was\r\ngliding fast away.\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' said the provost, \'it was not for myself, but this young\r\ngentlemen.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aweel, what for should I not pleasure the young gentlemen? I\'ll\r\njust drink to honest folk at hame and abroad, and deil ane else. And\r\nthen--but you have heard it before, Mrs. Crosbie?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not so often as to think it tiresome, I assure ye,\' said the lady; and\r\nwithout further preliminaries, the laird addressed Alan Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Ye have heard of a year they call the FORTY-FIVE, young gentleman;\r\nwhen the Southrons\' heads made their last acquaintance with Scottish\r\nclaymores? There was a set of rampauging chields in the country then\r\nthat they called rebels--I never could find out what for--Some men\r\nshould have been wi\' them that never came, provost--Skye and the Bush\r\naboon Traquair for that, ye ken.--Weel, the job was settled at last.\r\nCloured crowns were plenty, and raxed necks came into fashion. I dinna\r\nmind very weel what I was doing, swaggering about the country with dirk\r\nand pistol at my belt for five or six months, or thereaway; but I had\r\na weary waking out of a wild dream. When did I find myself on foot in a\r\nmisty morning, with my hand, just for fear of going astray, linked into\r\na handcuff, as they call it, with poor Harry Redgauntlet\'s fastened into\r\nthe other; and there we were, trudging along, with about a score more\r\nthat had thrust their horns ower deep in the bog, just like ourselves,\r\nand a sergeant\'s guard of redcoats, with twa file of dragoons, to\r\nkeep all quiet, and give us heart to the road. Now, if this mode of\r\ntravelling was not very pleasant, the object did not particularly\r\nrecommend it; for, you understand, young man, that they did not trust\r\nthese poor rebel bodies to be tried by juries of their ain kindly\r\ncountrymen, though ane would have thought they would have found Whigs\r\nenough in Scotland to hang us all; but they behoved to trounce us away\r\nto be tried at Carlisle, where the folk had been so frightened, that\r\nhad you brought a whole Highland clan at once into the court, they would\r\nhave put their hands upon their een, and cried, "hang them a\'," just to\r\nbe quit of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye,\' said the provost, \'that was a snell law, I grant ye.\'\r\n\r\n\'Snell!\' said the wife, \'snell! I wish they that passed it had the jury\r\nI would recommend them to!\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose the young lawyer thinks it all very right,\' said Summertrees,\r\nlooking at Fairford--\'an OLD lawyer might have thought otherwise.\r\nHowever, the cudgel was to be found to beat the dog, and they chose\r\na heavy one. Well, I kept my spirits better than my companion, poor\r\nfellow; for I had the luck to have neither wife nor child to think\r\nabout, and Harry Redgauntlet had both one and t\'other.--You have seen\r\nHarry, Mrs. Crosbie?\'\r\n\r\n\'In troth have I,\' said she, with the sigh which we give to early\r\nrecollections, of which the object is no more. \'He was not so tall as\r\nhis brother, and a gentler lad every way. After he married the great\r\nEnglish fortune, folk called him less of a Scottishman than Edward.\'\r\n\r\n\'Folk lee\'d, then,\' said Summertrees; \'poor Harry was none of your\r\nbold-speaking, ranting reivers, that talk about what they did yesterday,\r\nor what they will do to-morrow; it was when something was to do at the\r\nmoment that you should have looked at Harry Redgauntlet. I saw him at\r\nCulloden, when all was lost, doing more than twenty of these bleezing\r\nbraggarts, till the very soldiers that took him cried not to hurt\r\nhim--for all somebody\'s orders, provost--for he was the bravest fellow\r\nof them all. Weel, as I went by the side of Harry, and felt him raise my\r\nhand up in the mist of the morning, as if he wished to wipe his eye--for\r\nhe had not that freedom without my leave--my very heart was like to\r\nbreak for him, poor fellow. In the meanwhile, I had been trying and\r\ntrying to make my hand as fine as a lady\'s, to see if I could slip it\r\nout of my iron wristband. You may think,\' he said, laying his broad bony\r\nhand on the table, \'I had work enough with such a shoulder-of-mutton\r\nfist; but if you observe, the shackle-bones are of the largest, and so\r\nthey were obliged to keep the handcuff wide; at length I got my hand\r\nslipped out, and slipped in again; and poor Harry was sae deep in his\r\nain thoughts, I could not make him sensible what I was doing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\' said Alan Fairford, for whom the tale began to have some\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\'Because there was an unchancy beast of a dragoon riding close beside\r\nus on the other side; and if I had let him into my confidence as well as\r\nHarry, it would not have been long before a pistol-ball slapped through\r\nmy bonnet.--Well, I had little for it but to do the best I could for\r\nmyself; and, by my conscience, it was time, when the gallows was staring\r\nme in the face. We were to halt for breakfast at Moffat. Well did I know\r\nthe moors we were marching over, having hunted and hawked on every acre\r\nof ground in very different times. So I waited, you see, till I was on\r\nthe edge of Errickstane-brae--Ye ken the place they call the Marquis\'s\r\nBeef-stand, because the Annandale loons used to put their stolen cattle\r\nin there?\'\r\n\r\nFairford intimated his ignorance,\r\n\r\n\'Ye must have seen it as ye came this way; it looks as if four hills\r\nwere laying their heads together, to shut out daylight from the dark\r\nhollow space between them. A d--d deep, black, blackguard-looking\r\nabyss of a hole it is, and goes straight down from the roadside, as\r\nperpendicular as it can do, to be a heathery brae. At the bottom, there\r\nis a small bit of a brook, that you would think could hardly find, its\r\nway out from the hills that are so closely jammed round it.\'\r\n\r\n\'A bad pass, indeed,\' said Alan.\r\n\r\n\'You may say that,\' continued the laird. \'Bad as it was, sir, it was\r\nmy only chance; and though my very flesh creeped when I thought what a\r\nrumble I was going to get, yet I kept my heart up all the same. And so,\r\njust when we came on the edge of this Beef-stand of the Johnstones, I\r\nslipped out my hand from the handcuff, cried to Harry Gauntlet, \'Follow\r\nme!\'--whisked under the belly of the dragoon horse--flung my plaid round\r\nme with the speed of lightning--threw myself on my side, for there was\r\nno keeping my feet, and down the brae hurled I, over heather and fern,\r\nand blackberries, like a barrel down Chalmer\'s Close, in Auld Reekie.\r\nG--, sir, I never could help laughing when I think how the scoundrel\r\nredcoats must have been bumbazed; for the mist being, as I said, thick,\r\nthey had little notion, I take it, that they were on the verge of such\r\na dilemma. I was half way down--for rowing is faster wark than\r\nrinning--ere they could get at their arms; and then it was flash, flash,\r\nflash--rap, rap, rap--from the edge of the road; but my head was too\r\njumbled to think anything either of that or the hard knocks I got among\r\nthe stones. I kept my senses thegither, whilk has been thought wonderful\r\nby all that ever saw the place; and I helped myself with my hands as\r\ngallantly as I could, and to the bottom I came. There I lay for half\r\na moment; but the thoughts of a gallows is worth all the salts and\r\nscent-bottles in the world for bringing a man to himself. Up I sprang,\r\nlike a four-year-auld colt. All the hills were spinning round with me,\r\nlike so many great big humming-tops. But there was nae time to think of\r\nthat neither; more especially as the mist had risen a little with the\r\nfiring. I could see the villains, like sae mony craws on the edge of\r\nthe brae; and I reckon that they saw me; for some of the loons were\r\nbeginning to crawl down the hill, but liker auld wives in their red\r\ncloaks, coming frae a field preaching, than such a souple lad as I was.\r\nAccordingly, they soon began to stop and load their pieces. Good-e\'en to\r\nyou, gentlemen, thought I, if that is to be the gate of it. If you have\r\nany further word with me, you maun come as far as Carriefraw-gauns. And\r\nso off I set, and never buck went faster ower the braes than I did; and\r\nI never stopped till I had put three waters, reasonably deep, as the\r\nseason was rainy, half a dozen mountains, and a few thousand acres\r\nof the worst moss and ling in Scotland, betwixt me and my friends the\r\nredcoats.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was that job which got you the name of Pate-in-Peril,\' said the\r\nprovost, filling the glasses, and exclaiming with great emphasis,\r\nwhile his guest, much animated with the recollections which the\r\nexploit excited, looked round with an air of triumph for sympathy and\r\napplause,--\'Here is to your good health; and may you never put your neck\r\nin such a venture again.\' [The escape of a Jacobite gentleman while on\r\nthe road to Carlisle to take his trial for his share in the affair of\r\n1745, took place at Errickstane-brae, in the singular manner ascribed to\r\nthe Laird of Summertrees in the text. The author has seen in his youth\r\nthe gentleman to whom the adventure actually happened. The distance of\r\ntime makes some indistinctness of recollection, but it is believed the\r\nreal name was MacEwen or MacMillan.]\r\n\r\n\'Humph!--I do not know,\' answered Summertrees. \'I am not like to be\r\ntempted with another opportunity--[An old gentleman of the author\'s name\r\nwas engaged in the affair of 1715, and with some difficulty was saved\r\nfrom the gallows by the intercession of the Duchess of Buccleugh and\r\nMonmouth. Her Grace, who maintained a good deal of authority over her\r\nclan, sent for the object of her intercession, and warning him of the\r\nrisk which he had run, and the trouble she had taken on his account,\r\nwound up her lecture by intimating that in case of such disloyalty\r\nagain, he was not to expect her interest in his favour. \'An it please\r\nyour Grace,\' said the stout old Tory, \'I fear I am too old to see\r\nanother opportunity.\'] Yet who knows?\' And then he made a deep pause.\r\n\r\n\'May I ask what became of your friend, sir?\' said Alan Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, poor Harry!\' said Summertrees. \'I\'ll tell you what, sir, it takes\r\ntime to make up one\'s mind to such a venture, as my friend the provost\r\ncalls it; and I was told by Neil Maclean,--who was next file to us,\r\nbut had the luck to escape the gallows by some sleight-of-hand trick\r\nor other,--that, upon my breaking off, poor Harry stood like one\r\nmotionless, although all our brethren in captivity made as much tumult\r\nas they could, to distract the attention of the soldiers. And run he did\r\nat last; but he did not know the ground, and either from confusion, or\r\nbecause he judged the descent altogether perpendicular, he fled up\r\nthe hill to the left, instead of going down at once, and so was easily\r\npursued and taken. If he had followed my example, he would have found\r\nenough among the shepherds to hide him, and feed him, as they did me,\r\non bearmeal scenes and braxy mutton, till better days came round again.\'\r\n[BRAXY MUTTON.--The flesh of sheep that has died of disease, not by\r\nthe hand of the butcher. In pastoral countries it is used as food with\r\nlittle scruple.]\r\n\r\n\'He suffered then for his share in the insurrection?\' said Alan.\r\n\r\n\'You may swear that,\' said Summertrees. \'His blood was too red to be\r\nspared when that sort of paint was in request. He suffered, sir, as\r\nyou call it--that is, he was murdered in cold blood, with many a pretty\r\nfellow besides. Well, we may have our day next--what is fristed is not\r\nforgiven--they think us all dead and buried--but\'--Here he filled his\r\nglass, and muttering some indistinct denunciations, drank it off, and\r\nassumed his usual manner, which had been a little disturbed towards the\r\nend of the narrative.\r\n\r\n\'What became of Mr. Redgauntlet\'s child?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\nMISTER Redgauntlet! He was Sir Henry Redgauntlet, as his son, if the\r\nchild now lives, will be Sir Arthur--I called him Harry from intimacy,\r\nand Redgauntlet, as the chief of his name--His proper style was Sir\r\nHenry Redgauntlet.\'\r\n\r\n\'His son, therefore, is dead?\' said Alan Fairford. \'It is a pity so\r\nbrave a line should draw to a close.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has left a brother,\' said Summertrees, \'Edward Hugh Redgauntlet, who\r\nhas now the representation of the family. And well it is; for though he\r\nbe unfortunate in many respects, he will keep up the honour of the house\r\nbetter than a boy bred up amongst these bitter Whigs, the relations of\r\nhis elder brother Sir Henry\'s lady. Then they are on no good terms with\r\nthe Redgauntlet line--bitter Whigs they are in every sense. It was a\r\nrunaway match betwixt Sir Henry and his lady. Poor thing, they would not\r\nallow her to see him when in confinement--they had even the meanness to\r\nleave him without pecuniary assistance; and as all his own property was\r\nseized upon and plundered, he would have wanted common necessaries, but\r\nfor the attachment of a fellow who was a famous fiddler--a blind man--I\r\nhave seen him with Sir Henry myself, both before the affair broke out\r\nand while it was going on. I have heard that he fiddled in the streets\r\nof Carlisle, and carried what money he got to his master, while he was\r\nconfined in the castle.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not believe a word of it,\' said Mrs. Crosbie, kindling with\r\nindignation. \'A Redgauntlet would have died twenty times before he had\r\ntouched a fiddler\'s wages.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hout fye--hout fye--all nonsense and pride,\' said the Laird of\r\nSummertrees. \'Scornful dogs will eat dirty puddings, cousin Crosbie--ye\r\nlittle ken what some of your friends were obliged to do yon time for a\r\nsowp of brose, or a bit of bannock. G--d, I carried a cutler\'s wheel for\r\nseveral weeks, partly for need, and partly for disguise--there I went\r\nbizz--bizz--whizz--zizz, at every auld wife\'s door; and if ever you want\r\nyour shears sharpened, Mrs. Crosbie, I am the lad to do it for you, if\r\nmy wheel was but in order.\'\r\n\r\n\'You, must ask my leave first,\' said the provost; \'for I have been told\r\nyou had some queer fashions of taking a kiss instead of a penny, if you\r\nliked your customer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, come, provost,\' said the lady; rising, \'if the maut gets abune\r\nthe meal with you, it is time for me to take myself away--And you will\r\ncome to my room, gentlemen, when you want a cup of tea.\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford was not sorry for the lady\'s departure. She seemed too\r\nmuch alive to the honour of the house of Redgauntlet, though only a\r\nfourth cousin, not to be alarmed by the inquiries which he proposed\r\nto make after the whereabout of its present head. Strange confused\r\nsuspicions arose in his mind, from his imperfect recollection of the\r\ntale of Wandering Willie, and the idea forced itself upon him that his\r\nfriend Darsie Latimer might be the son of the unfortunate Sir Henry. But\r\nbefore indulging in such speculations, the point was to discover what\r\nhad actually become of him. If he were in the hands of his uncle, might\r\nthere not exist some rivalry in fortune, or rank, which might induce so\r\nstern a man as Redgauntlet to use unfair measures towards a youth whom\r\nhe would find himself unable to mould to his purpose? He considered\r\nthese points in silence, during several revolutions of the glasses\r\nas they wheeled in galaxy round the bowl, waiting until the provost,\r\nagreeably to his own proposal, should mention the subject, for which he\r\nhad expressly introduced him to Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees.\r\n\r\nApparently the provost had forgot his promise, or at least was in no\r\ngreat haste to fulfil it. He debated with great earnestness upon the\r\nStamp Act, which was then impending over the American colonies, and upon\r\nother political subjects of the day, but said not a word of Redgauntlet.\r\nAlan soon saw that the investigation he meditated must advance, if at\r\nall, on his own special motion, and determined to proceed accordingly.\r\n\r\nActing upon this resolution, he took the first opportunity afforded by\r\na pause in the discussion of colonial politics, to say, \'I must remind\r\nyou, Provost Crosbie, of your kind promise to procure some intelligence\r\nupon the subject I am so anxious about.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gadso!\' said the provost, after a moment\'s hesitation, \'it is very\r\ntrue.--Mr. Maxwell, we wish to consult you on a piece of important\r\nbusiness. You must know indeed I think you must have heard, that the\r\nfishermen at Brokenburn, and higher up the Solway, have made a raid upon\r\nQuaker Geddes\'s stake-nets, and levelled all with the sands.\'\r\n\r\n\'In troth I heard it, provost, and I was glad to hear the scoundrels had\r\nso much pluck left as to right themselves against a fashion which would\r\nmake the upper heritors a sort of clocking-hens, to hatch the fish that\r\nfolk below them were to catch and eat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, sir,\' said Alan, \'that is not the present point. But a young\r\nfriend of mine was with Mr. Geddes at the time this violent procedure\r\ntook place, and he has not since been heard of. Now, our friend, the\r\nprovost, thinks that you may be able to advise\'--\r\n\r\nHere he was interrupted by the provost and Summertrees speaking out\r\nboth at once, the first endeavouring to disclaim all interest in the\r\nquestion, and the last to evade giving an answer.\r\n\r\n\'Me think!\' said the provost; \'I never thought twice about it, Mr.\r\nFairford; it was neither fish, nor flesh, nor salt herring of mine.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I "able to advise"!\' said Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees; \'what the\r\ndevil can I advise you to do, excepting to send the bellman through the\r\ntown to cry your lost sheep, as they do spaniel dogs or stray ponies?\'\r\n\r\n\'With your pardon,\' said Alan, calmly, but resolutely, \'I must ask a\r\nmore serious answer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, Mr. Advocate,\' answered Summertrees, \'I thought it was your\r\nbusiness to give advice to the lieges, and not to take it from poor\r\nstupid country gentlemen.\'\r\n\r\n\'If not exactly advice, it is sometimes our duty to ask questions, Mr.\r\nMaxwell.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, sir, when you have your bag-wig and your gown on, we must\r\nallow you the usual privilege of both gown and petticoat, to ask what\r\nquestions you please. But when you are out of your canonicals, the case\r\nis altered. How come you, sir, to suppose that I have any business with\r\nthis riotous proceeding, or should know more than you do what happened\r\nthere? the question proceeds on an uncivil supposition.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will explain,\' said Alan, determined to give Mr. Maxwell no\r\nopportunity of breaking off the conversation. \'You are an intimate of\r\nMr. Redgauntlet--he is accused of having been engaged in this affray,\r\nand of having placed under forcible restraint the person of my friend,\r\nDarsie Latimer, a young man of property and consequence, whose fate I am\r\nhere for the express purpose of investigating. This is the plain\r\nstate of the case; and all parties concerned,--your friend, in\r\nparticular,--will have reason to be thankful for the temperate manner\r\nin which it is my purpose to conduct the matter, if I am treated with\r\nproportionate frankness.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have misunderstood me,\' said Maxwell, with a tone changed to\r\nmore composure; \'I told you I was the friend of the late Sir Henry\r\nRedgauntlet, who was executed, in 1745, at Hairibie, near Carlisle, but\r\nI know no one who at present bears the name of Redgauntlet.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know Mr. Herries of Birrenswork,\' said Alan, smiling, \'to whom the\r\nname of Redgauntlet belongs?\'\r\n\r\nMaxwell darted a keen reproachful look towards the provost, but\r\ninstantly smoothed his brow, and changed his tone to that of confidence\r\nand candour.\r\n\r\n\'You must not be angry, Mr. Fairford, that the poor persecuted nonjurors\r\nare a little upon the QUI VIVE when such clever young men as you are\r\nmaking inquiries after us. I myself now, though I am quite out of the\r\nscrape, and may cock my hat at the Cross as I best like, sunshine or\r\nmoonshine, have been yet so much accustomed to walk with the lap of my\r\ncloak cast over my face, that, faith, if a redcoat walk suddenly up\r\nto me, I wish for my wheel and whetstone again for a moment. Now\r\nRedgauntlet, poor fellow, is far worse off--he is, you may have heard,\r\nstill under the lash of the law,--the mark of the beast is still on his\r\nforehead, poor gentleman,--and that makes us cautious--very cautious,\r\nwhich I am sure there is no occasion to be towards you, as no one of\r\nyour appearance and manners would wish to trepan a gentleman under\r\nmisfortune.\'\r\n\r\n\'On the contrary, sir,\' said Fairford, \'I wish to afford Mr.\r\nRedgauntlet\'s friends an opportunity to get him out of the scrape, by\r\nprocuring the instant liberation of my friend Darsie Latimer. I will\r\nengage that if he has sustained no greater bodily harm than a short\r\nconfinement, the matter may be passed over quietly, without inquiry; but\r\nto attain this end, so desirable for the man who has committed a great\r\nand recent infraction of the laws, which he had before grievously\r\noffended, very speedy reparation of the wrong must be rendered.\'\r\n\r\nMaxwell seemed lost in reflection, and exchanged a glance or two, not of\r\nthe most comfortable or congratulatory kind, with his host the provost.\r\nFairford rose and walked about the room, to allow them an opportunity\r\nof conversing together; for he was in hopes that the impression he\r\nhad visibly made upon Summertrees was likely to ripen into something\r\nfavourable to his purpose. They took the opportunity, and engaged in\r\nwhispers to each other, eagerly and reproachfully on the part of the\r\nlaird, while the provost answered in an embarrassed and apologetical\r\ntone. Some broken words of the conversation reached Fairford, whose\r\npresence they seemed to forget, as he stood at the bottom of the room,\r\napparently intent upon examining the figures upon a fine Indian screen,\r\na present to the provost from his brother, captain of a vessel in the\r\nCompany\'s service. What he overheard made it evident that his errand,\r\nand the obstinacy with which he pursued it, occasioned altercation\r\nbetween the whisperers.\r\n\r\nMaxwell at length let out the words, \'A good fright; and so send him\r\nhome with his tail scalded, like a dog that has come a-privateering on\r\nstrange premises.\'\r\n\r\nThe provost\'s negative was strongly interposed--\'Not to be thought\r\nof\'--\'making bad worse\'--\'my situation\'--\'my utility\'--\'you cannot\r\nconceive how obstinate--just like his father\'.\r\n\r\nThey then whispered more closely, and at length the provost raised his\r\ndrooping crest, and spoke in a cheerful tone. \'Come, sit down to your\r\nglass, Mr. Fairford; we have laid our heads thegither, and you shall see\r\nit will not be our fault if you are not quite pleased, and Mr.\r\nDarsie Latimer let loose to take his fiddle under his neck again. But\r\nSummertrees thinks it will require you to put yourself into some bodily\r\nrisk, which maybe you may not be so keen of.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gentlemen,\' said Fairford, \'I will not certainly shun any risk by which\r\nmy object may be accomplished; but I bind it on your consciences--on\r\nyours, Mr. Maxwell, as a man of honour and a gentleman; and on yours,\r\nprovost, as a magistrate and a loyal subject, that you do not mislead me\r\nin this matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, as for me,\' said Summertrees, \'I will tell you the truth at\r\nonce, and fairly own that I can certainly find you the means of seeing\r\nRedgauntlet, poor man; and that I will do, if you require it, and\r\nconjure him also to treat you as your errand requires; but poor\r\nRedgauntlet is much changed--indeed, to say truth, his temper never was\r\nthe best in the world; however, I will warrant you from any very great\r\ndanger.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will warrant myself from such,\' said Fairford, \'by carrying a proper\r\nforce with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed,\' said Summertrees, \'you will, do no such thing; for, in the\r\nfirst place, do you think that we will deliver up the poor fellow into\r\nthe hands of the Philistines, when, on the contrary, my only reason for\r\nfurnishing you with the clue I am to put into your hands, is to settle\r\nthe matter amicably on all sides? And secondly, his intelligence is so\r\ngood, that were you coming near him with soldiers, or constables, or the\r\nlike, I shall answer for it, you will never lay salt on his tail.\'\r\n\r\nFairford mused for a moment. He considered that to gain sight of this\r\nman, and knowledge of his friend\'s condition, were advantages to be\r\npurchased at every personal risk; and he saw plainly, that were he to\r\ntake the course most safe for himself, and call in the assistance of\r\nthe law, it was clear he would either be deprived of the intelligence\r\nnecessary to guide him, or that Redgauntlet would be apprised of his\r\ndanger, and might probably leave the country, carrying his captive\r\nalong with him. He therefore repeated, \'I put myself on your honour, Mr.\r\nMaxwell; and I will go alone to visit your friend. I have little; doubt\r\nI shall find him amenable to reason; and that I shall receive from him a\r\nsatisfactory account of Mr. Latimer.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have little doubt that you will,\' said Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees;\r\n\'but still I think it will be only in the long run, and after having\r\nsustained some delay and inconvenience. My warrandice goes no further.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will take it as it is given,\' said Alan Fairford. \'But let me ask,\r\nwould it not be better, since you value your friend\'s safety so highly\r\nand surely would not willingly compromise mine, that the provost or you\r\nshould go with me to this man, if he is within any reasonable distance,\r\nand try to make him hear reason?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me!--I will not go my foot\'s length,\' said the provost; and that, Mr.\r\nAlan, you may be well assured of. Mr. Redgauntlet is my wife\'s fourth\r\ncousin, that is undeniable; but were he the last of her kin and mine\r\nboth, it would ill befit my office to be communing with rebels.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, or drinking with nonjurors,\' said Maxwell, filling his glass. \'I\r\nwould as soon expect; to have met Claverhouse at a field-preaching. And\r\nas for myself, Mr. Fairford, I cannot go, for just the opposite reason.\r\nIt would be INFRA DIG. in the provost of this most flourishing and loyal\r\ntown to associate with Redgauntlet; and for me it would be NOSCITUR A\r\nSOCIO. There would be post to London, with the tidings that two such\r\nJacobites as Redgauntlet and I had met on a braeside--the Habeas Corpus\r\nwould be suspended--Fame would sound a charge from Carlisle to the\r\nLand\'s End--and who knows but the very wind of the rumour might blow my\r\nestate from between my fingers, and my body over Errickstane-brae again?\r\nNo, no; bide a gliff--I will go into the provost\'s closet, and write a\r\nletter to Redgauntlet, and direct you how to deliver it.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is pen and ink in the office,\' said the provost, pointing to the\r\ndoor of an inner apartment, in which he had his walnut-tree desk and\r\neast-country cabinet.\r\n\r\n\'A pen that can write, I hope?\' said the old laird.\r\n\r\n\'It can write and spell baith in right hands,\' answered the provost, as\r\nthe laird retired and shut the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED\r\n\r\nThe room was no sooner deprived of Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees\'s\r\npresence, than the provost looked very warily above, beneath, and around\r\nthe apartment, hitched his chair towards that of his remaining guest,\r\nand began to speak In a whisper which could not have startled \'the\r\nsmallest mouse that creeps on floor.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Fairford,\' said he, \'you are a good lad; and, what is more, you are\r\nmy auld friend your father\'s son. Your father has been agent for this\r\nburgh for years, and has a good deal to say with the council; so there\r\nhave been a sort of obligations between him and me; it may have been now\r\non this side and now on that; but obligations there have been. I am but\r\na plain man, Mr. Fairford; but I hope you understand me?\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe you mean me well, provost; and I am sure,\' replied Fairford,\r\n\'you can never better show your kindness than on this occasion.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s it--that\'s the very point I would be at, Mr. Alan,\' replied the\r\nprovost; \'besides, I am, as becomes well my situation, a stanch friend\r\nto kirk and king, meaning this present establishment in church and\r\nstate; and so, as I was saying, you may command my best--advice.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope for your assistance and co-operation also,\' said the youth.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly, certainly,\' said the wary magistrate. \'Well, now, you see\r\none may love the kirk, and yet not ride on the rigging of it; and one\r\nmay love the king, and yet not be cramming him eternally down the throat\r\nof the unhappy folk that may chance to like another king better. I have\r\nfriends and connexions among them, Mr. Fairford, as your father may have\r\nclients--they are flesh and blood like ourselves, these poor Jacobite\r\nbodies--sons of Adam and Eve, after all; and therefore--I hope you\r\nunderstand me?--I am a plain-spoken man.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid I do not quite understand you,\' said Fairford; \'and if you\r\nhave anything to say to me in private, my dear provost, you had better\r\ncome quickly out with it, for the Laird of Summertrees must finish his\r\nletter in a minute or two.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a bit, man--Pate is a lang-headed fellow, but his pen does not\r\nclear the paper as his greyhound does the Tinwald-furs. I gave him\r\na wipe about that, if you noticed; I can say anything to\r\nPate-in-Peril--Indeed, he is my wife\'s near kinsman.\'\r\n\r\n\'But your advice, provost,\' said Alan, who perceived that, like a shy\r\nhorse, the worthy magistrate always started off from his own purpose\r\njust when he seemed approaching to it.\r\n\r\n\'Weel, you shall have it in plain terms, for I am a plain man. Ye see,\r\nwe will suppose that any friend like yourself were in the deepest hole\r\nof the Nith, sand making a sprattle for your life. Now, you see, such\r\nbeing the case, I have little chance of helping you, being a fat,\r\nshort-armed man, and no swimmer, and what would be the use of my jumping\r\nin after you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I understand you, I think,\' said Alan Fairford. \'You think that Darsie\r\nLatimer is in danger of his life?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me!--I think nothing about it, Mr. Alan; but if he were, as I trust he\r\nis not, he is nae drap\'s blood akin to you, Mr. Alan.\'\r\n\r\n\'But here your friend, Summertrees,\' said the young lawyer, \'offers me a\r\nletter to this Redgauntlet of yours--What say you to that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me!\' ejaculated the provost, \'me, Mr. Alan? I say neither buff nor\r\nstye to it--But ye dinna ken what it is to look a Redgauntlet in the\r\nface;--better try my wife, who is but a fourth cousin, before ye venture\r\non the laird himself--just say something about the Revolution, and see\r\nwhat a look she can gie you.\'\r\n\r\nI shall leave you to stand all the shots from that battery, provost.\'\r\nreplied Fairford. \'But speak out like a man--Do you think Summertrees\r\nmeans fairly by me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Fairly--he is just coming--fairly? I am a plain man, Mr. Fairford--but\r\nye said FAIRLY?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do so,\' replied Alan, \'and it is of importance to me to know, and\r\nto you to tell me if such is the case; for if you do not, you may be an\r\naccomplice to murder before the fact, and that under circumstances which\r\nmay bring it near to murder under trust.\'\r\n\r\n\'Murder!--who spoke of murder?\' said the provost; no danger of that, Mr.\r\nAlan--only, if I were you--to speak my plain mind\'--Here he approached\r\nhis mouth to the ear of the young lawyer, and, after another acute pang\r\nof travail, was safely delivered of his advice in the following abrupt\r\nwords:--\'Take a keek into Pate\'s letter before ye deliver it.\'\r\n\r\nFairford started, looked the provost hard in the face, and was silent;\r\nwhile Mr. Crosbie, with the self-approbation of one who has at length\r\nbrought himself to the discharge of a great duty, at the expense of a\r\nconsiderable sacrifice, nodded and winked to Alan, as if enforcing his\r\nadvice; and then swallowing a large glass of punch, concluded, with\r\nthe sigh of a man released from a heavy burden, \'I am a plain man, Mr.\r\nFairford.\'\r\n\r\n\'A plain man?\' said Maxwell, who entered the room at that moment, with\r\nthe letter in his hand,--\'Provost, I never heard you make use of the\r\nword but when you had some sly turn of your own to work out.\'\r\n\r\nThe provost looked silly enough, and the Laird of Summertrees directed\r\na keen and suspicious glance upon Alan Fairford, who sustained it with\r\nprofessional intrepidity.--There was a moment\'s pause.\r\n\r\n\'I was trying,\' said the provost, \'to dissuade our young friend from his\r\nwildgoose expedition.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I,\' said Fairford, \'am determined to go through with it. Trusting\r\nmyself to you, Mr. Maxwell, I conceive that I rely, as I before said, on\r\nthe word of a gentleman.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will warrant you,\' said Maxwell, \'from all serious consequences--some\r\ninconveniences you must look to suffer.\'\r\n\r\n\'To these I shall be resigned,\' said Fairford, \'and stand prepared to\r\nrun my risk.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well then,\' said Summertrees, \'you must go\'--\r\n\r\n\'I will leave you to yourselves, gentlemen,\' said the provost, rising;\r\n\'when you have done with your crack, you will find me at my wife\'s\r\ntea-table.\'\r\n\r\n\'And a more accomplished old woman never drank catlap,\' said Maxwell,\r\nas he shut the door; \'the last word has him, speak it who will--and yet\r\nbecause he is a whillywhaw body, and has a plausible tongue of his own,\r\nand is well enough connected, and especially because nobody could ever\r\nfind out whether he is Whig or Tory, this is the third time they\r\nhave made him provost!--But to the matter in hand. This letter, Mr.\r\nFairford,\' putting a sealed one into his hand, \'is addressed, you\r\nobserve, to Mr. H--of B--, and contains your credentials for that\r\ngentlemen, who is also known by his family name of Redgauntlet, but\r\nless frequently addressed by it, because it is mentioned something\r\ninvidiously in a certain Act of Parliament. I have little doubt he will\r\nassure you of your friend\'s safety, and in a short time place him at\r\nfreedom--that is, supposing him under present restraint. But the point\r\nis, to discover where he is--and, before you are made acquainted with\r\nthis necessary part of the business, you must give me your assurance of\r\nhonour that you will acquaint no one, either by word or letter, with the\r\nexpedition which you now propose to yourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'How, sir?\' answered Alan; \'can you expect that I will not take the\r\nprecaution of informing some person of the route I am about to take,\r\nthat in case of accident it may be known where I am, and with what\r\npurpose I have gone thither?\'\r\n\r\n\'And can you expect,\' answered Maxwell, in the same tone, \'that I am to\r\nplace my friend\'s safety, not merely in your hands, but in those of any\r\nperson you may choose to confide in, and who may use the knowledge to\r\nhis destruction? Na--na--I have pledged my word for your safety, and you\r\nmust give me yours to be private in the matter--giff-gaff, you know.\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford could not help thinking that this obligation to secrecy\r\ngave a new and suspicious colouring to the whole transaction; but,\r\nconsidering that his friend\'s release might depend upon his accepting\r\nthe condition, he gave it in the terms proposed, and with the purpose of\r\nabiding by it.\r\n\r\n\'And now, sir,\' he said, \'whither am I to proceed with this letter? Is\r\nMr. Herries at Brokenburn?\'\r\n\r\n\'He is not; I do not think he will come thither again until the business\r\nof the stake-nets be hushed up, nor would I advise him to do so--the\r\nQuakers, with all their demureness, can bear malice as long as other\r\nfolk; and though I have not the prudence of Mr. Provost, who refuses to\r\nken where his friends are concealed during adversity, lest, perchance,\r\nhe should be asked to contribute to their relief, yet I do not think it\r\nnecessary or prudent to inquire into Redgauntlet\'s wanderings, poor man,\r\nbut wish to remain at perfect freedom to answer, if asked at, that I\r\nken nothing of the matter. You must, then, go to old Tom Trumbull\'s at\r\nAnnan,--Tam Turnpenny, as they call him,--and he is sure either to know\r\nwhere Redgauntlet is himself, or to find some one who can give a shrewd\r\nguess. But you must attend that old Turnpenny will answer no question on\r\nsuch a subject without you give him the passport, which at present you\r\nmust do, by asking him the age of the moon; if he answers, "Not light\r\nenough to land a cargo," you are to answer, "Then plague on Aberdeen\r\nAlmanacks," and upon that he will hold free intercourse with you.\r\nAnd now, I would advise you to lose no time, for the parole is often\r\nchanged--and take care of yourself among these moonlight lads, for laws\r\nand lawyers do not stand very high in their favour.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will set out this instant,\' said the young barrister; \'I will but bid\r\nthe provost and Mrs. Crosbie farewell, and then get on horseback so soon\r\nas the ostler of the George Inn can saddle him;--as for the smugglers,\r\nI am neither gauger nor supervisor, and, like the man who met the devil,\r\nif they have nothing to say to me, I have nothing to say to them.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are a mettled young man,\' said Summertrees, evidently with\r\nincreasing goodwill, on observing an alertness and contempt of\r\ndanger, which perhaps he did not expect from Alan\'s appearance and\r\nprofession,--\'a very mettled young fellow indeed! and it is almost a\r\npity\'--Here he stopped abort.\r\n\r\n\'What is a pity?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'It is almost a pity that I cannot go with you myself, or at least send\r\na trusty guide.\'\r\n\r\nThey walked together to the bedchamber of Mrs. Crosbie, for it was in\r\nthat asylum that the ladies of the period dispensed their tea, when the\r\nparlour was occupied by the punch-bowl.\r\n\r\n\'You have been good bairns to-night, gentlemen,\' said Mrs. Crosbie; \'I\r\nam afraid, Summertrees, that the provost has given you a bad browst; you\r\nare not used to quit the lee-side of the punch-bowl in such a hurry. I\r\nsay nothing to you, Mr. Fairford, for you are too young a man yet for\r\nstoup and bicker; but I hope you will not tell the Edinburgh fine folk\r\nthat the provost has scrimped you of your cogie, as the sang says?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am much obliged for the provost\'s kindness, and yours, madam,\'\r\nreplied Alan; \'but the truth is, I have still a long ride before me this\r\nevening and the sooner I am on horse-back the better.\'\r\n\r\n\'This evening?\' said the provost, anxiously; \'had you not better take\r\ndaylight with you to-morrow morning?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Fairford will ride as well in the cool of the evening,\' said\r\nSummertrees, taking the word out of Alan\'s mouth.\r\n\r\nThe provost said no more, nor did his wife ask any questions, nor\r\ntestify any surprise at the suddenness of their guest\'s departure.\r\n\r\nHaving drunk tea, Alan Fairford took leave with the usual ceremony.\r\nThe Laird of Summertrees seemed studious to prevent any further\r\ncommunication between him and the provost, and remained lounging on\r\nthe landing-place of the stair while they made their adieus--heard the\r\nprovost ask if Alan proposed a speedy return, and the latter reply that\r\nhis stay was uncertain, and witnessed the parting shake of the hand,\r\nwhich, with a pressure more warm than usual, and a tremulous, \'God bless\r\nand prosper you!\' Mr. Crosbie bestowed on his young friend. Maxwell even\r\nstrolled with Fairford as far as the George, although resisting all\r\nhis attempts at further inquiry into the affairs of Redgauntlet, and\r\nreferring him to Tom Trumbull, alias Turnpenny, for the particulars\r\nwhich he might find it necessary to inquire into.\r\n\r\nAt length Alan\'s hack was produced--an animal long in neck, and high\r\nin bone, accoutred with a pair of saddle-bags containing the rider\'s\r\ntravelling wardrobe. Proudly surmounting his small stock of necessaries,\r\nand no way ashamed of a mode of travelling which a modern Mr.\r\nSilvertongue would consider as the last of degradations, Alan Fairford\r\ntook leave of the old Jacobite, Pate-in-Peril, and set forward on the\r\nroad to the loyal burgh of Annan. His reflections during his ride were\r\nnone of the most pleasant. He could not disguise from himself that he\r\nwas venturing rather too rashly into the power of outlawed and desperate\r\npersons; for with such only, a man in the situation of Redgauntlet could\r\nbe supposed to associate. There were other grounds for apprehension,\r\nSeveral marks of intelligence betwixt Mrs. Crosbie and the Laird of\r\nSummertrees had not escaped Alan\'s acute observation; and it was plain\r\nthat the provost\'s inclinations towards him, which he believed to be\r\nsincere and good, were not firm enough to withstand the influence of\r\nthis league between his wife and friend. The provost\'s adieus, like\r\nMacbeth\'s amen, had stuck in his throat, and seemed to intimate that he\r\napprehended more than he dared give utterance to.\r\n\r\nLaying all these matters together, Alan thought, with no little anxiety\r\non the celebrated lines of Shakespeare,\r\n\r\n                                  -- A drop,\r\n  That in the ocean seeks another drop, &c.\r\n\r\nBut pertinacity was a strong feature in the young lawyer\'s character.\r\nHe was, and always had been, totally unlike the \'horse hot at hand,\' who\r\ntires before noon through his own over eager exertions in the beginning\r\nof the day. On the contrary, his first efforts seemed frequently\r\ninadequate to accomplishing his purpose, whatever that for the time\r\nmight be; and it was only as the difficulties of the task increased,\r\nthat his mind seemed to acquire the energy necessary to combat and\r\nsubdue them. If, therefore, he went anxiously forward upon his uncertain\r\nand perilous expedition, the reader must acquit him of all idea, even\r\nin a passing thought, of the possibility of abandoning his search, and\r\nresigning Darsie Latimer to his destiny.\r\n\r\nA couple of hours\' riding brought him to the little town of Annan,\r\nsituated on the shores of the Solway, between eight and nine o\'clock.\r\nThe sun had set, but the day was not yet ended; and when he had alighted\r\nand seen his horse properly cared for at the principal inn of the place,\r\nhe was readily directed to Mr. Maxwell\'s friend, old Tom Trumbull, with\r\nwhom everybody seemed well acquainted. He endeavoured to fish out from\r\nthe lad that acted as a guide, something of this man\'s situation and\r\nprofession; but the general expressions of \'a very decent man\'--\'a very\r\nhonest body\'--\'weel to pass in the world,\' and such like, were all that\r\ncould be extracted from him; and while Fairford was following up the\r\ninvestigation with closer interrogatories, the lad put an end to them by\r\nknocking at the door of Mr. Trumbull, whose decent dwelling was a little\r\ndistance from the town, and considerably nearer to the sea. It was one\r\nof a little row of houses running down to the waterside, and having\r\ngardens and other accommodations behind. There was heard within\r\nthe uplifting of a Scottish psalm; and the boy saying, \'They are at\r\nexercise, sir,\' gave intimation they might not be admitted till prayers\r\nwere over.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Fairford repeated the summons with the end of his whip,\r\nthe singing ceased, and Mr. Trumbull himself, with his psalm-book in his\r\nhand, kept open by the insertion of his forefinger between the leaves,\r\ncame to demand the meaning of this unseasonable interruption.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more different than his whole appearance seemed to be\r\nfrom the confidant of a desperate man, and the associate of outlaws in\r\ntheir unlawful enterprises. He was a tall, thin, bony figure, with white\r\nhair combed straight down on each side of his face, and an iron-grey hue\r\nof complexion; where the lines, or rather, as Quin said of Macklin, the\r\ncordage, of his countenance were so sternly adapted to a devotional and\r\neven ascetic expression, that they left no room for any indication of\r\nreckless daring or sly dissimulation. In short, Trumbull appeared a\r\nperfect specimen of the rigid old Covenanter, who said only what he\r\nthought right, acted on no other principle but that of duty, and, if he\r\ncommitted errors, did so under the full impression that he was serving\r\nGod rather than man.\r\n\r\n\'Do you want me, sir?\' he said to Fairford, whose guide had slunk to\r\nthe rear, as if to escape the rebuke of the severe old man,--\'We were\r\nengaged, and it is the Saturday night.\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford\'s preconceptions were so much deranged by this man\'s\r\nappearance and manner, that he stood for a moment bewildered, and would\r\nas soon have thought of giving a cant password to a clergyman descending\r\nfrom the pulpit, as to the respectable father of a family just\r\ninterrupted in his prayers for and with the objects of his care. Hastily\r\nconcluding Mr. Maxwell had passed some idle jest on him, or rather that\r\nhe had mistaken the person to whom he was directed, he asked if he spoke\r\nto Mr. Trumbull.\r\n\r\n\'To Thomas Trumbull,\' answered the old man--\'What may be your business,\r\nsir?\' And he glanced his eye to the book he held in his hand, with a\r\nsigh like that of a saint desirous of dissolution.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'I have heard of such a gentleman in the country-side, but have no\r\nacquaintance with him,\' answered Mr. Trumbull; \'he is, as I have heard,\r\na Papist; for the whore that sitteth on the seven hills ceaseth not yet\r\nto pour forth the cup of her abomination on these parts.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yet he directed me hither, my good friend,\' said Alan. \'Is there\r\nanother of your name in this town of Annan?\'\r\n\r\n\'None,\' replied Mr. Trumbull, \'since my worthy father was removed; he\r\nwas indeed a shining light.--I wish you good even, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stay one single instant,\' said Fairford; \'this is a matter of life and\r\ndeath.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not more than the casting the burden of our sins where they should be\r\nlaid,\' said Thomas Trumbull, about to shut the door in the inquirer\'s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know,\' said Alan Fairford, \'the Laird of Redgauntlet?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now Heaven defend me from treason and rebellion!\' exclaimed Trumbull.\r\n\'Young gentleman, you are importunate. I live here among my own people,\r\nand do not consort with Jacobites and mass-mongers.\'\r\n\r\nHe seemed about to shut the door, but did NOT shut it, a circumstance\r\nwhich did not escape Alan\'s notice.\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Redgauntlet is sometimes,\' he said, \'called Herries of Birrenswork;\r\nperhaps you may know him under that name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Friend, you are uncivil,\' answered Mr. Trumbull; \'honest men have\r\nenough to do to keep one name undefiled. I ken nothing about those who\r\nhave two. Good even to you, friend.\'\r\n\r\nHe was now about to slam the door in his visitor\'s face without\r\nfurther ceremony, when Alan, who had observed symptoms that the name\r\nof Redgauntlet did not seem altogether so indifferent to him as he\r\npretended, arrested his purpose by saying, in a low voice, \'At least you\r\ncan tell me what age the moon is?\'\r\n\r\nThe old man started, as if from a trance, and before answering, surveyed\r\nthe querist with a keen penetrating glance, which seemed to say, \'Are\r\nyou really in possession of this key to my confidence, or do you speak\r\nfrom mere accident?\'\r\n\r\nTo this keen look of scrutiny, Fairford replied by a smile of\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe iron muscles of the old man\'s face did not, however, relax, as he\r\ndropped, in a careless manner, the countersign, \'Not light enough to\r\nland a cargo.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then plague of all Aberdeen Almanacks!\'\r\n\r\n\'And plague of all fools that waste time,\' said Thomas Trumbull, \'Could\r\nyou not have said as much at first? And standing wasting time, and\r\nencouraging; lookers-on, in the open street too? Come in by--in by.\'\r\n\r\nHe drew his visitor into the dark entrance of the house, and shut\r\nthe door carefully; then putting his head into an apartment which the\r\nmurmurs within announced to be filled with the family, he said aloud, \'A\r\nwork of necessity and mercy--Malachi, take the book--You will sing six\r\ndouble verses of the hundred and nineteen-and you may lecture out of the\r\nLamentations. And, Malachi,\'--this he said in an undertone,--\'see you\r\ngive them a a creed of doctrine that will last them till I come back; or\r\nelse these inconsiderate lads will be out of the house, and away to the\r\npublics, wasting their precious time, and, it may be, putting themselves\r\nin the way of missing the morning tide.\'\r\n\r\nAn inarticulate answer from within intimated Malachi\'s acquiescence in\r\nthe commands imposed; and, Mr. Trumbull, shutting the door, muttered\r\nsomething about fast bind, fast find, turned the key, and put it into\r\nhis pocket; and then bidding his visitor have a care of his steps, and\r\nmake no noise, he led him through the house, and out at a back-door,\r\ninto a little garden. Here a plaited alley conducted them, without\r\nthe possibility of their being seen by any neighbour, to a door in the\r\ngarden-wall, which being opened, proved to be a private entrance into\r\na three-stalled stable; in one of which was a horse, that whinnied on\r\ntheir entrance. \'Hush, hush!\' cried the old man, and presently seconded\r\nhis exhortations to silence by throwing a handful of corn into the\r\nmanger, and the horse soon converted his acknowledgement of their\r\npresence into the usual sound of munching and grinding his provender.\r\n\r\nAs the light was now failing fast, the old man, with much more alertness\r\nthan might have been expected from the rigidity of his figure, closed\r\nthe window-shutters in an instant, produced phosphorus and matches,\r\nand lighted a stable-lantern, which he placed on the corn-bin, and then\r\naddressed Fairford. \'We are private here, young man; and as some time\r\nhas been wasted already, you will be so kind as to tell me what is your\r\nerrand. Is it about the way of business, or the other job?\'\r\n\r\n\'My business with you, Mr. Trumbull, is to request you will find me the\r\nmeans of delivering this letter, from Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees to the\r\nLaird of Redgauntlet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Humph--fashious job! Pate Maxwell will still be the auld man--always\r\nPate-in-Peril--Craig-in-Peril, for what I know. Let me see the letter\r\nfrom him.\'\r\n\r\nHe examined it with much care, turning it up and down, and looking at\r\nthe seal very attentively. \'All\'s right, I see; it has the private mark\r\nfor haste and speed. I bless my Maker that I am no great man, or great\r\nman\'s fellow; and so I think no more of these passages than just to help\r\nthem forward in the way of business. You are an utter stranger in these\r\nparts, I warrant?\'\r\n\r\nFairford answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\'Aye--I never saw them make a wiser choice--I must call some one to\r\ndirect you what to do--Stay, we must go to him, I believe. You are well\r\nrecommended to me, friend, and doubtless trusty; otherwise you may\r\nsee more than I would like to show, or am in the use of showing in the\r\ncommon line of business.\'\r\n\r\nSaying this, he placed his lantern on the ground, beside the post of one\r\nof the empty stalls, drew up a small spring bolt which secured it to\r\nthe floor, and then forcing the post to one side, discovered a small\r\ntrap-door. \'Follow me,\' he said, and dived into the subterranean descent\r\nto which this secret aperture gave access.\r\n\r\nFairford plunged after him, not without apprehensions of more kinds than\r\none, but still resolved to prosecute the adventure.\r\n\r\nThe descent, which was not above six feet, led to a very narrow passage,\r\nwhich seemed to have been constructed for the precise purpose of\r\nexcluding every one who chanced to be an inch more in girth than was his\r\nconductor. A small vaulted room, of about eight feet square, received\r\nthem at the end of this lane. Here Mr. Trumbull left Fairford alone, and\r\nreturned for an instant, as he said, to shut his concealed trap-door.\r\n\r\nFairford liked not his departure, as it left him in utter darkness;\r\nbesides that his breathing was much affected by a strong and stifling\r\nsmell of spirits, and other articles of a savour more powerful than\r\nagreeable to the lungs. He was very glad, therefore, when he heard the\r\nreturning steps of Mr. Trumbull, who, when once more by his side, opened\r\na strong though narrow door in the wall, and conveyed Fairford into\r\nan immense magazine of spirit-casks, and other articles of contraband\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThere was a small, light at the end of this range of well-stocked\r\nsubterranean vaults, which, upon a low whistle, began to flicker and\r\nmove towards them. An undefined figure, holding a dark lantern, with the\r\nlight averted, approached them, whom Mr. Trumbull thus addressed:--\'Why\r\nwere you not at worship, Job; and this Saturday at e\'en?\'\r\n\r\n\'Swanston was loading the JENNY, sir; and I stayed to serve out the\r\narticle.\'\r\n\r\n\'True--a work of necessity, and in the way of business. Does the JUMPING\r\nJENNY sail this tide?\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye, sir; she sails for\'--\r\n\r\n\'I did not ask you WHERE she sailed for, Job,\' said the old gentleman,\r\ninterrupting him. \'I thank my Maker, I know nothing of their incomings\r\nor outgoings. I sell my article fairly and in the ordinary way of\r\nbusiness; and I wash my hands of everything else. But what I wished to\r\nknow is, whether the gentleman called the Laird of the Solway Lakes is\r\non the other side of the Border even now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye,\' said Job, \'the laird is something in my own line, you\r\nknow--a little contraband or so, There is a statute for him--But no\r\nmatter; he took the sands after the splore at the Quaker\'s fish-traps\r\nyonder; for he has a leal heart, the laird, and is always true to the\r\ncountry-side. But avast--is all snug here?\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he suddenly turned on Alan Fairford the light side of the\r\nlantern he carried, who, by the transient gleam which it threw in\r\npassing on the man who bore it, saw a huge figure, upwards of six\r\nfeet high, with a rough hairy cap on his head, and a set of features\r\ncorresponding to his bulky frame. He thought also he observed pistols at\r\nhis belt.\r\n\r\n\'I will answer for this gentleman,\' said Mr. Trumbull; \'he must be\r\nbrought to speech of the laird.\'\r\n\r\n\'That will be kittle steering,\' said the subordinate personage; \'for I\r\nunderstood that the laird and his folk were no sooner on the other\r\nside than the land-sharks were on them, and some mounted lobsters from\r\nCarlisle; and so they were obliged to split and squander. There are new\r\nbrooms out to sweep the country of them, they say; for the brush was a\r\nhard one; and they say there was a lad drowned;--he was not one of the\r\nlaird\'s gang, so there was the less matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Peace! prithee, peace, Job Rutledge,\' said honest, pacific Mr.\r\nTrumbull. \'I wish thou couldst remember, man, that I desire to know\r\nnothing of your roars and splores, your brooms and brushes. I dwell here\r\namong my own people; and I sell my commodity to him who comes in the\r\nway of business; and so wash my hands of all consequences, as becomes\r\na quiet subject and an honest man. I never take payment, save in ready\r\nmoney.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye,\' muttered he with the lantern, \'your worship, Mr. Trumbull,\r\nunderstands that in the way of business.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I hope you will one day know, Job,\' answered Mr. Trumbull,--\'the\r\ncomfort of a conscience void of offence, and that fears neither gauger\r\nnor collector, neither excise nor customs. The business is to pass this\r\ngentleman to Cumberland upon earnest business, and to procure him speech\r\nwith the Laird of the Solway Lakes--I suppose that can be done? Now I\r\nthink Nanty Ewart, if he sails with the brig this morning tide, is the\r\nman to set him forward.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye, truly is he,\' said Job; \'never man knew the Border, dale and\r\nfell, pasture and ploughland, better than Nanty; and he can always bring\r\nhim to the laird, too, if you are sure the gentleman\'s right. But indeed\r\nthat\'s his own look-out; for were he the best man in Scotland, and the\r\nchairman of the d--d Board to boot, and had fifty men at his back, he\r\nwere as well not visit the laird for anything but good. As for Nanty, he\r\nis word and blow, a d--d deal fiercer than Cristie Nixon that they keep\r\nsuch a din about. I have seen them both tried, by\'--\r\n\r\nFairford now found himself called upon to say something; yet his\r\nfeelings, upon finding himself thus completely in the power of a canting\r\nhypocrite, and of his retainer, who had so much the air of a determined\r\nruffian, joined to the strong and abominable fume which they snuffed up\r\nwith indifference, while it almost deprived him of respiration, combined\r\nto render utterance difficult. He stated, however, that he had no evil\r\nintentions towards the laird, as they called him, but was only the\r\nbearer of a letter to him on particular business, from Mr. Maxwell of\r\nSummertrees.\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye,\' said Job, \'that may be well enough; and if Mr. Trumbull is\r\nsatisfied that the service is right, why, we will give you a cast in\r\nthe JUMPING JENNY this tide, and Nanty Ewart will put you on a way of\r\nfinding the laird, I warrant you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I may for the present return, I presume, to the inn where I left my\r\nhorse?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'With pardon,\' replied Mr. Trumbull, \'you have been ower far ben with\r\nus for that; but Job will take you to a place where you may sleep\r\nrough till he calls you. I will bring you what little baggage you can\r\nneed--for those who go on such errands must not be dainty. I will myself\r\nsee after your horse, for a merciful man is merciful to his beast--a\r\nmatter too often forgotten in our way of business.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, Master Trumbull,\' replied Job, \'you know that when we are chased,\r\nit\'s no time to shorten sail, and so the boys do ride whip and spur.\'\r\nHe stopped in his speech, observing the old man had vanished through\r\nthe door by which he had entered--\'That\'s always the way with old\r\nTurnpenny,\' he said to Fairford; \'he cares for nothing of the trade but\r\nthe profit--now, d--me, if I don\'t think the fun of it is better worth\r\nwhile. But come along, my fine chap; I must stow you away in safety\r\nuntil it is time to go aboard.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED\r\n\r\nFairford followed his gruff guide among a labyrinth of barrels and\r\npuncheons, on which he had more than once like to have broken his nose,\r\nand from thence into what, by the glimpse of the passing lantern upon a\r\ndesk and writing materials, seemed to be a small office for the\r\ndispatch of business. Here there appeared no exit; but the smuggler, or\r\nsmuggler\'s ally, availing himself of a ladder, removed an old picture,\r\nwhich showed a door about seven feet from the ground, and Fairford,\r\nstill following Job, was involved in another tortuous and dark passage,\r\nwhich involuntarily reminded him of Peter Peebles\'s lawsuit. At the end\r\nof this labyrinth, when he had little guess where he had been conducted,\r\nand was, according to the French phrase, totally DESORIENTE, Job\r\nsuddenly set down the lantern, and availing himself of the flame to\r\nlight two candles which stood on the table, asked if Alan would choose\r\nanything to eat, recommending, at all events, a slug of brandy to\r\nkeep out the night air. Fairford declined both, but inquired after his\r\nbaggage.\r\n\r\n\'The old master will take care of that himself,\' said Job Rutledge; and\r\ndrawing back in the direction in which he had entered, he vanished from\r\nthe farther end of the apartment, by a mode which the candles, still\r\nshedding an imperfect light, gave Alan no means of ascertaining. Thus\r\nthe adventurous young lawyer was left alone in the apartment to which he\r\nhad been conducted by so singular a passage.\r\n\r\nIn this condition, it was Alan\'s first employment to survey, with some\r\naccuracy, the place where he was; and accordingly, having trimmed the\r\nlights, he walked slowly round the apartment, examining its appearance\r\nand dimensions. It seemed to be such a small dining-parlour as is\r\nusually found in the house of the better class of artisans, shopkeepers,\r\nand such persons, having a recess at the upper end, and the usual\r\nfurniture of an ordinary description. He found a door, which he\r\nendeavoured to open, but it was locked on the outside. A corresponding\r\ndoor on the same side of the apartment admitted him into a closet, upon\r\nthe front shelves of which were punch-bowls, glasses, tea-cups, and the\r\nlike, while on one side was hung a horseman\'s greatcoat of the coarsest\r\nmaterials, with two great horse-pistols peeping out of the pocket,\r\nand on the floor stood a pair of well-spattered jack-boots, the usual\r\nequipment of the time, at least for long journeys.\r\n\r\nNot greatly liking the contents of the closet, Alan Fairford shut the\r\ndoor, and resumed his scrutiny round the walls of the apartment, in\r\norder to discover the mode of Job Rutledge\'s retreat. The secret passage\r\nwas, however, too artificially concealed, and the young lawyer had\r\nnothing better to do than to meditate on the singularity of his present\r\nsituation. He had long known that the excise laws had occasioned an\r\nactive contraband trade betwixt Scotland and England, which then, as\r\nnow, existed, and will continue to exist until the utter abolition of\r\nthe wretched system which establishes an inequality of duties betwixt\r\nthe different parts of the same kingdom; a system, be it said in\r\npassing, mightily resembling the conduct of a pugilist, who should tie\r\nup one arm that he might fight the better with the other. But Fairford\r\nwas unprepared for the expensive and regular establishments by which the\r\nillicit traffic was carried on, and could not have conceived that the\r\ncapital employed in it should have been adequate to the erection of\r\nthese extensive buildings, with all their contrivances for secrecy of\r\ncommunication. He was musing on these circumstances, not without some\r\nanxiety for the progress of his own journey, when suddenly, as he\r\nlifted his eyes, he discovered old Mr. Trumbull at the upper end of the\r\napartment, bearing in one hand a small bundle, in the other his dark\r\nlantern, the light of which, as he advanced, he directed full upon\r\nFairford\'s countenance.\r\n\r\nThough such an apparition was exactly what he expected, yet he did\r\nnot see the grim, stern old man present himself thus suddenly without\r\nemotion; especially when he recollected, what to a youth of his pious\r\neducation was peculiarly shocking, that the grizzled hypocrite was\r\nprobably that instant arisen from his knees to Heaven, for the purpose\r\nof engaging in the mysterious transactions of a desperate and illegal\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe old man, accustomed to judge with ready sharpness of the physiognomy\r\nof those with whom he had business, did not fail to remark something\r\nlike agitation in Fairford\'s demeanour. \'Have ye taken the rue?\' said\r\nhe. \'Will ye take the sheaf from the mare, and give up the venture?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never!\' said Fairford, firmly, stimulated at once by his natural\r\nspirit, and the recollection of his friend; \'never, while I have life\r\nand strength to follow it out!\'\r\n\r\n\'I have brought you,\' said Trumbull, \'a clean shirt, and some stockings,\r\nwhich is all the baggage you can conveniently carry, and I will cause\r\none of the lads lend you a horseman\'s coat, for it is ill sailing or\r\nriding without one; and, touching your valise, it will be as safe in\r\nmy poor house, were it full of the gold of Ophir, as if it were in the\r\ndepth of the mine.\' \'I have no doubt of it,\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'And now,\' said Trumbull, again, \'I pray you to tell me by what name I\r\nam to name you to Nanty (which is Antony) Ewart?\'\r\n\r\n\'By the name of Alan Fairford,\' answered the young lawyer.\r\n\r\n\'But that,\' said Mr. Trumbull, in reply, \'is your own proper name and\r\nsurname.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what other should I give?\' said the young man; \'do you think I\r\nhave any occasion for an alias? And, besides, Mr. Trumbull,\' added Alan,\r\nthinking a little raillery might intimate confidence of spirit, \'you\r\nblessed yourself, but a little while since, that you had no acquaintance\r\nwith those who defiled their names so far as to be obliged to change\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\n\'True, very true,\' said Mr. Trumbull; \'nevertheless, young man, my grey\r\nhairs stand unreproved in this matter; for, in my line of business, when\r\nI sit under my vine and my fig-tree, exchanging the strong waters of the\r\nnorth for the gold which is the price thereof, I have, I thank Heaven,\r\nno disguises to keep with any man, and wear my own name of Thomas\r\nTrumbull, without any chance that the same may be polluted. Whereas,\r\nthou, who art to journey in miry ways, and amongst a strange people,\r\nmayst do well to have two names, as thou hast two shirts, the one to\r\nkeep the other clean.\'\r\n\r\nHere he emitted a chuckling grunt, which lasted for two vibrations of\r\nthe pendulum exactly, and was the only approach towards laughter in\r\nwhich old Turnpenny, as he was nicknamed, was ever known to indulge.\r\n\r\n\'You are witty, Mr. Trumbull,\' said Fairford; \'but jests are no\r\narguments--I shall keep my own name.\'\r\n\r\n\'At your own pleasure,\' said the merchant; \'there is but one name\r\nwhich,\' &c. &c, &c.\r\n\r\nWe will not follow the hypocrite through the impious cant which he\r\nadded, in order to close the subject.\r\n\r\nAlan followed him, in silent abhorrence, to the recess in which the\r\nbeaufet was placed, and which was so artificially made as to conceal\r\nanother of those traps with which the whole building abounded. This\r\nconcealment admitted them to the same winding passage by which the young\r\nlawyer had been brought thither. The path which they now took amid\r\nthese mazes, differed from the direction in which he had been guided\r\nby Rutledge. It led upwards, and terminated beneath a garret window.\r\nTrumbull opened it, and with more agility than his age promised,\r\nclambered out upon the leads. If Fairford\'s journey had been hitherto in\r\na stifled and subterranean atmosphere, it was now open, lofty, and airy\r\nenough; for he had to follow his guide over leads and slates, which\r\nthe old smuggler traversed with the dexterity of a cat. It is true, his\r\ncourse was facilitated by knowing exactly where certain stepping-places\r\nand holdfasts were placed, of which Fairford could not so readily avail\r\nhimself; but, after a difficult and somewhat perilous progress along\r\nthe roofs of two or three houses, they at length descended by a skylight\r\ninto a garret room, and from thence by the stairs into a public-house;\r\nfor such it appeared, by the ringing of bells, whistling for waiters and\r\nattendance, bawling of \'House, house, here!\' chorus of sea songs, and\r\nthe like noises.\r\n\r\nHaving descended to the second story, and entered a room there in which\r\nthere was a light, old Mr. Trumbull rang the bell of the apartment\r\nthrice, with an interval betwixt each, during which he told deliberately\r\nthe number twenty. Immediately after the third ringing the landlord\r\nappeared, with stealthy step, and an appearance of mystery on his buxom\r\nvisage. He greeted Mr. Trumbull, who was his landlord as it proved, with\r\ngreat respect, and expressed some surprise at seeing him so late, as he\r\ntermed it, \'on Saturday e\'en.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I, Robin Hastie,\' said the landlord to the tenant, am more\r\nsurprised than pleased, to hear sae muckle din in your house, Robie, so\r\nnear the honourable Sabbath; and I must mind you that it is contravening\r\nthe terms of your tack, whilk stipulates that you should shut your\r\npublic on Saturday at nine o\'clock, at latest.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' said Robin Hastie, no way alarmed at the gravity of the\r\nrebuke, \'but you must take tent that I have admitted naebody but you,\r\nMr. Trumbull (who by the way admitted yoursell), since nine o\'clock for\r\nthe most of the folk have been here for several hours about the lading,\r\nand so on, of the brig. It is not full tide yet, and I cannot put the\r\nmen out into the street. If I did, they would go to some other public,\r\nand their souls would be nane the better, and my purse muckle the waur;\r\nfor how am I to pay the rent if I do not sell the liquor?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, then,\' said Thomas Trumbull, \'if it is a work of necessity, and\r\nin the honest independent way of business, no doubt there is balm in\r\nGilead. But prithee, Robin, wilt thou see if Nanty Ewart be, as is most\r\nlikely, amongst these unhappy topers; and if so, let him step this way\r\ncannily, and speak to me and this young gentleman. And it\'s dry talking,\r\nRobin--you must minister to us a bowl of punch--ye ken my gage.\'\r\n\r\n\'From a mutchkin to a gallon, I ken your honour\'s taste, Mr. Thomas\r\nTrumbull,\' said mine host; \'and ye shall hang me over the signpost if\r\nthere be a drap mair lemon or a curn less sugar than just suits you.\r\nThere are three of you--you will be for the auld Scots peremptory\r\npint-stoup for the success of the voyage?\' [The Scottish pint of liquid\r\nmeasure comprehends four English measures of the same denomination. The\r\njest is well known of my poor countryman, who, driven to extremity by\r\nthe raillery of the Southern, on the small denomination of the Scottish\r\ncoin, at length answered, \'Aye, aye! But the deil tak them that has the\r\nLEAST PINT-STOUP.\']\r\n\r\n\'Better pray for it than drink for it, Robin,\' said Mr. Trumbull. \'Yours\r\nis a dangerous trade, Robin; it hurts mony a ane--baith host and guest.\r\nBut ye will get the blue bowl, Robin--the blue bowl--that will sloken\r\nall their drouth, and prevent the sinful repetition of whipping for\r\nan eke of a Saturday at e\'en. Aye, Robin, it is a pity of Nanty\r\nEwart--Nanty likes the turning up of his little finger unco weel, and we\r\nmaunna stint him, Robin, so as we leave him sense to steer by.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nanty Ewart could steer through the Pentland Firth though he were as\r\ndrunk as the Baltic Ocean,\' said Robin Hastie; and instantly tripping\r\ndownstairs, he speedily returned with the materials for what he called\r\nhis BROWST, which consisted of two English quarts of spirits, in a huge\r\nblue bowl, with all the ingredients for punch in the same formidable\r\nproportion. At the same time he introduced Mr. Antony or Nanty Ewart,\r\nwhose person, although he was a good deal flustered with liquor,\r\nwas different from what Fairford expected. His dress was what is\r\nemphatically termed the shabby genteel--a frock with tarnished lace--a\r\nsmall cocked hat, ornamented in a similar way--a scarlet waistcoat, with\r\nfaded embroidery, breeches of the same, with silver knee-bands, and he\r\nwore a smart hanger and a pair of pistols in a sullied swordbelt.\r\n\r\n\'Here I come, patron,\' he said, shaking hands with Mr. Trumbull. \'Well,\r\nI see you have got some grog aboard.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not my custom, Mr. Ewart,\' said the old gentleman, \'as you well\r\nknow, to become a chamberer or carouser thus late on Saturday at e\'en;\r\nbut I wanted to recommend to your attention a young friend of ours,\r\nthat is going upon a something particular journey, with a letter to our\r\nfriend the Laird from Pate-in-Peril, as they call him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye--indeed?--he must be in high trust for so young a gentleman. I wish\r\nyou joy, sir,\' bowing to Fairford. \'By\'r lady, as Shakespeare says, you\r\nare bringing up a neck for a fair end. Come, patron, we will drink to\r\nMr. What-shall-call-um. What is his name? Did you tell me? And have I\r\nforgot it already.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Alan Fairford,\' said Trumbull.\r\n\r\n\'Aye, Mr. Alan Fairford--a good name for a fair trader--Mr. Alan\r\nFairford; and may he be long withheld from the topmost round of\r\nambition, which I take to be the highest round of a certain ladder.\'\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, he seized the punch-ladle, and began to fill the\r\nglasses. But Mr. Trumbull arrested his hand, until he had, as he\r\nexpressed himself, sanctified the liquor by a long grace; during the\r\npronunciation of which he shut indeed his eyes, but his nostrils became\r\ndilated, as if he were snuffing up the fragrant beverage with peculiar\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\nWhen the grace was at length over, the three friends sat down to their\r\nbeverage, and invited Alan Fairford to partake. Anxious about his\r\nsituation, and disgusted as he was with his company, he craved, and with\r\ndifficulty obtained permission, under the allegation of being fatigued,\r\nheated, and the like, to stretch himself on a couch which was in\r\nthe apartment, and attempted at least to procure some rest before\r\nhigh-water, when the vessel was to sail.\r\n\r\nHe was at length permitted to use his freedom, and stretched himself on\r\nthe couch, having his eyes for some time fixed on the jovial party he\r\nhad left, and straining his ears to catch if possible a little of their\r\nconversation. This he soon found was to no purpose for what did actually\r\nreach his ears was disguised so completely by the use of cant words and\r\nthe thieves-latin called slang, that even when he caught the words, he\r\nfound himself as far as ever from the sense of their conversation. At\r\nlength he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was after Alan had slumbered for three or four hours, that he was\r\nwakened by voices bidding him rise up and prepare to be jogging. He\r\nstarted up accordingly, and found himself in presence of the same party\r\nof boon companions; who had just dispatched their huge bowl of punch. To\r\nAlan\'s surprise, the liquor had made but little innovation on the\r\nbrains of men who were accustomed to drink at all hours, and in the most\r\ninordinate quantities. The landlord indeed spoke a little thick, and the\r\ntexts of Mr. Thomas Trumbull stumbled on his tongue; but Nanty was one\r\nof those topers, who, becoming early what bon vivants term flustered,\r\nremain whole nights and days at the same point of intoxication; and,\r\nin fact, as they are seldom entirely sober, can be as rarely seen\r\nabsolutely drunk. Indeed, Fairford, had he not known how Ewart had been\r\nengaged whilst he himself was asleep, would almost have sworn when he\r\nawoke, that the man was more sober than when he first entered the room.\r\n\r\nHe was confirmed in this opinion when they descended below, where two or\r\nthree sailors and ruffian-looking fellows awaited their commands. Ewart\r\ntook the whole direction upon himself, gave his orders with briefness\r\nand precision, and looked to their being executed with the silence and\r\ncelerity which that peculiar crisis required. All were now dismissed\r\nfor the brig, which lay, as Fairford was given to understand, a little\r\nfarther down the river, which is navigable for vessels of light burden\r\ntill almost within a mile of the town.\r\n\r\nWhen they issued from the inn, the landlord bid them goodbye. Old\r\nTrumbull walked a little way with them, but the air had probably\r\nconsiderable effect on the state of his brain; for after reminding\r\nAlan Fairford that the next day was the honourable Sabbath, he became\r\nextremely excursive in an attempt to exhort him to keep it holy. At\r\nlength, being perhaps sensible that he was becoming unintelligible, he\r\nthrust a volume into Fairford\'s hand--hiccuping at the same time--\'Good\r\nbook--good book--fine hymn-book--fit for the honourable Sabbath, whilk\r\nawaits us to-morrow morning.\' Here the iron tongue of time told\r\nfive from the town steeple of Annan, to the further confusion of Mr.\r\nTrumbull\'s already disordered ideas. \'Aye? Is Sunday come and gone\r\nalready? Heaven be praised! Only it is a marvel the afternoon is sae\r\ndark for the time of the year--Sabbath has slipped ower quietly, but we\r\nhave reason to bless oursells it has not been altogether misemployed.\r\nI heard little of the preaching--a cauld moralist, I doubt, served that\r\nout--but, eh--the prayer--I mind it as if I had said the words mysell.\'\r\nHere he repeated one or two petitions, which were probably a part of his\r\nfamily devotions, before he was summoned forth to what he called the\r\nway of business. \'I never remember a Sabbath pass so cannily off in my\r\nlife.\' Then he recollected himself a little, and said to Alan, \'You\r\nmay read that book, Mr. Fairford, to-morrow, all the same, though it be\r\nMonday; for, you see, it was Saturday when we were thegither, and now\r\nit\'s Sunday and it\'s dark night--so the Sabbath has slipped clean away\r\nthrough our fingers like water through a sieve, which abideth not; and\r\nwe have to begin again to-morrow morning, in the weariful, base, mean,\r\nearthly employments, whilk are unworthy of an immortal spirit--always\r\nexcepting the way of business.\'\r\n\r\nThree of the fellows were now returning to the town, and, at Ewart\'s\r\ncommand, they cut short the patriarch\'s exhortation, by leading him back\r\nto his own residence. The rest of the party then proceeded to the brig,\r\nwhich only waited their arrival to get under weigh and drop down the\r\nriver. Nanty Ewart betook himself to steering the brig, and the very\r\ntouch of the helm seemed to dispel the remaining influence of the liquor\r\nwhich he had drunk, since, through a troublesome and intricate channel,\r\nhe was able to direct the course of his little vessel with the most\r\nperfect accuracy and safety.\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford, for some time, availed himself of the clearness of the\r\nsummer morning to gaze on the dimly seen shores betwixt which they\r\nglided, becoming less and less distinct as they receded from each other,\r\nuntil at length, having adjusted his little bundle by way of pillow, and\r\nwrapped around him the greatcoat with which old Trumbull had equipped\r\nhim, he stretched himself on the deck, to try to recover the slumber out\r\nof which he had been awakened. Sleep had scarce begun to settle on\r\nhis eyes, ere he found something stirring about his person. With ready\r\npresence of mind he recollected his situation, and resolved to show no\r\nalarm until the purpose of this became obvious; but he was soon relieved\r\nfrom his anxiety, by finding it was only the result of Nanty\'s attention\r\nto his comfort, who was wrapping around him, as softly as he could, a\r\ngreat boatcloak, in order to defend him from the morning air.\r\n\r\n\'Thou art but a cockerel,\' he muttered, \'but \'twere pity thou wert\r\nknocked off the perch before seeing a little more of the sweet and sour\r\nof this world--though, faith, if thou hast the usual luck of it, the\r\nbest way were to leave thee to the chance of a seasoning fever.\'\r\n\r\nThese words, and the awkward courtesy with which the skipper of the\r\nlittle brig tucked the sea-coat round Fairford, gave him a confidence of\r\nsafety which he had not yet thoroughly possessed. He stretched himself\r\nin more security on the hard planks, and was speedily asleep, though his\r\nslumbers were feverish and unrefreshing.\r\n\r\nIt has been elsewhere intimated that Alan Fairford inherited from his\r\nmother a delicate constitution, with a tendency to consumption; and,\r\nbeing an only child, with such a cause for apprehension, care, to the\r\nverge of effeminacy, was taken to preserve him from damp beds, wet\r\nfeet, and those various emergencies to which the Caledonian boys of much\r\nhigher birth, but more active habits, are generally accustomed. In man,\r\nthe spirit sustains the constitutional weakness, as in the winged\r\ntribes the feathers bear aloft the body. But there is a bound to these\r\nsupporting qualities; and as the pinions of the bird must at length grow\r\nweary, so the VIS ANIMI of the human struggler becomes broken down by\r\ncontinued fatigue.\r\n\r\nWhen the voyager was awakened by the light of the sun now riding high\r\nin heaven, he found himself under the influence of an almost intolerable\r\nheadache, with heat, thirst, shooting across the back and loins, and\r\nother symptoms intimating violent cold, accompanied with fever. The\r\nmanner in which he had passed the preceding day and night, though\r\nperhaps it might have been of little consequence to most young men, was\r\nto him, delicate in constitution and nurture, attended with bad and even\r\nperilous consequences. He felt this was the case, yet would fain have\r\ncombated the symptoms of indisposition, which, indeed, he imputed\r\nchiefly to sea-sickness. He sat up on deck, and looked on the scene\r\naround, as the little vessel, having borne down the Solway Firth, was\r\nbeginning, with a favourable northerly breeze, to bear away to the\r\nsouthward, crossing the entrance of the Wampool river, and preparing to\r\ndouble the most northerly point of Cumberland.\r\n\r\nBut Fairford felt annoyed with deadly sickness, as well as by pain of\r\na distressing and oppressive character; and neither Criffel, rising in\r\nmajesty on the one hand, nor the distant yet more picturesque outline of\r\nSkiddaw and Glaramara upon the other, could attract his attention in\r\nthe manner in which it was usually fixed by beautiful scenery, and\r\nespecially that which had in it something new as well as striking. Yet\r\nit was not in Alan Fairford\'s nature to give way to despondence, even\r\nwhen seconded by pain. He had recourse, in the first place, to his\r\npocket; but instead of the little Sallust he had brought with him, that\r\nthe perusal of a classical author might help to pass away a heavy hour,\r\nhe pulled out the supposed hymn-book with which he had been presented\r\na few hours before, by that temperate and scrupulous person, Mr. Thomas\r\nTrumbull, ALIAS Turnpenny. The volume was bound in sable, and its\r\nexterior might have become a psalter. But what was Alan\'s astonishment\r\nto read on the title page the following words:--\'Merry Thoughts for\r\nMerry Men; or Mother Midnight\'s Miscellany for the Small Hours;\' and\r\nturning over the leaves, he was disgusted with profligate tales, and\r\nmore profligate songs, ornamented with figures corresponding in infamy\r\nwith the letterpress.\r\n\r\n\'Good God!\' he thought, \'and did this hoary reprobate summon his family\r\ntogether, and, with such a disgraceful pledge of infamy in his bosom,\r\nventure to approach the throne of his Creator? It must be so; the book\r\nis bound after the manner of those dedicated to devotional subjects,\r\nand doubtless the wretch, in his intoxication, confounded the books\r\nhe carried with him, as he did the days of the week.\' Seized with the\r\ndisgust with which the young and generous usually regard the vices of\r\nadvanced life, Alan, having turned the leaves of the book over in hasty\r\ndisdain, flung it from him, as far as he could, into the sea. He then\r\nhad recourse to the Sallust, which he had at first sought for in vain.\r\nAs he opened the book, Nanty Ewart, who had been looking over his\r\nshoulder, made his own opinion heard.\r\n\r\n\'I think now, brother, if you are so much scandalized at a little piece\r\nof sculduddery, which, after all, does nobody any harm, you had better\r\nhave given it to me than have flung it into the Solway.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope, sir,\' answered Fairford, civilly, \'you are in the habit of\r\nreading better books.\'\r\n\r\n\'Faith,\' answered Nanty, \'with help of a little Geneva text, I could\r\nread my Sallust as well as you can;\' and snatching the book from Alan\'s\r\nhand, he began to read, in the Scottish accent:--"\'IGITUR EX DIVITIIS\r\nJUVENTUTEM LUXURIA ATQUE AVARITIA CUM SUPERBILI INVASERE: RAPERE,\r\nCONSUMERE; SUA PARVI PENDERE, ALIENA CUPERE; PUDOREM, AMICITIAM,\r\nPUDICITIAM, DIVINA ATQUE HUMANA PROMISCUA, NIHIL PENSI NEQUE MODERATI\r\nHABERE." [The translation of the passage is thus given by Sir Henry\r\nSteuart of Allanton:--\'The youth, taught to look up to riches as the\r\nsovereign good, became apt pupils in the school of Luxury. Rapacity and\r\nprofusion went hand in hand. Careless of their own fortunes, and eager\r\nto possess those of others, shame and remorse, modesty and moderation,\r\nevery principle gave way.\'--WORKS OF SALLUST, WITH ORIGINAL ESSAYS, vol.\r\nii. p.17.]--There is a slap in the face now, for an honest fellow that\r\nhas been buccaneering! Never could keep a groat of what he got, or hold\r\nhis fingers from what belonged to another, said you? Fie, fie, friend\r\nCrispus, thy morals are as crabbed and austere as thy style--the one has\r\nas little mercy as the other has grace. By my soul, it is unhandsome\r\nto make personal reflections on an old acquaintance, who seeks a little\r\ncivil intercourse with you after nigh twenty years\' separation. On my\r\nsoul, Master Sallust deserves to float on the Solway better than Mother\r\nMidnight herself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps, in some respects, he may merit better usage at our hands,\'\r\nsaid Alan; \'for if he has described vice plainly, it seems to have been\r\nfor the purpose of rendering it generally abhorred.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said the seaman, \'I have heard of the Sortes Virgilianae, and\r\nI dare say the Sortes Sallustianae are as true every tittle. I have\r\nconsulted honest Crispus on my own account, and have had a cuff for\r\nmy pains. But now see, I open the book on your behalf, and behold\r\nwhat occurs first to my eye!--Lo you there--"CATILINA ... OMNIUM\r\nFLAGITIOSORUM ATQUE FACINOROSORUM CIRCUM SE HABEBAT." And then\r\nagain--"ETIAM SI QUIS A CULPA VACUUS IN AMICITIAM EJUS INCIDIDERAT\r\nQUOTIDIANO USU PAR SIMILISQUE CAETERIS EFFICIEBATUR." [After enumerating\r\nthe evil qualities of Catiline\'s associates, the author adds, \'If it\r\nhappened that any as yet uncontaminated by vice were fatally drawn into\r\nhis friendship, the effects of intercourse and snares artfully\r\nspread, subdued every scruple, and early assimilated them to their\r\nconductors.\'--Ibidem, p. 19.] That is what I call plain speaking on the\r\npart of the old Roman, Mr. Fairford. By the way, that is a capital name\r\nfor a lawyer.\r\n\r\n\'Lawyer as I am,\' said Fairford, \'I do not understand your innuendo.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, then,\' said Ewart, \'I can try it another way, as well as the\r\nhypocritical old rascal Turnpenny himself could do. I would have you to\r\nknow that I am well acquainted with my Bible-book, as well as with my\r\nfriend Sallust.\' He then, in a snuffling and canting tone, began to\r\nrepeat the Scriptural text--\'"DAVID THEREFORE DEPARTED THENCE, AND WENT\r\nTO THE CAVE OF ADULLAM. AND EVERY ONE THAT WAS IN DISTRESS, AND EVERY\r\nONE THAT WAS IN DEBT, AND EVERY ONE THAT WAS DISCONTENTED, GATHERED\r\nTHEMSELVES TOGETHER UNTO HIM, AND HE BECAME A CAPTAIN OVER THEM." What\r\nthink you of that?\' he said, suddenly changing his manner. \'Have I\r\ntouched you now, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'You are as far off as ever,\' replied Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'What the devil! and you a repeating frigate between Summertrees and the\r\nlaird! Tell that to the marines--the sailors won\'t believe it. But you\r\nare right to be cautious, since you can\'t say who are right, who not.\r\nBut you look ill; it\'s but the cold morning air. Will you have a can\r\nof flip, or a jorum of hot rumbo? or will you splice the mainbrace\'\r\n(showing a spirit-flask). \'Will you have a quid--or a pipe--or a\r\ncigar?--a pinch of snuff, at least, to clear your brains and sharpen\r\nyour apprehension?\'\r\n\r\nFairford rejected all these friendly propositions.\r\n\r\n\'Why, then,\' continued Ewart, \'if you will do nothing for the free\r\ntrade, I must patronize it myself.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took a large glass of brandy.\r\n\r\n\'A hair of the dog that bit me,\' he continued,--\'of the dog that will\r\nworry me one day soon; and yet, and be d--d to me for an idiot, I must\r\nalways have hint at my throat. But, says the old catch\'--Here he sang,\r\nand sang well--\r\n\r\n  \'Let\'s drink--let\'s drink--while life we have;\r\n   We\'ll find but cold drinking, cold drinking in the grave.\r\n\r\nAll this,\' he continued, \'is no charm against the headache. I wish I\r\nhad anything that could do you good. Faith, and we have tea and coffee\r\naboard! I\'ll open a chest or a bag, and let you have some in an instant.\r\nYou are at the age to like such catlap better than better stuff.\'\r\n\r\nFairford thanked him, and accepted his offer of tea.\r\n\r\nNanty Ewart was soon heard calling about, \'Break open yon chest--take\r\nout your capful, you bastard of a powder-monkey; we may want it again.\r\nNo sugar? all used up for grog, say you? knock another loaf to pieces,\r\ncan\'t ye? and get the kettle boiling, ye hell\'s baby, in no time at\r\nall!\'\r\n\r\nBy dint of these energetic proceedings he was in a short time able to\r\nreturn to the place where his passenger lay sick and exhausted, with a\r\ncup, or rather a canful, of tea; for everything was on a large scale\r\non board of the JUMPING JENNY. Alan drank it eagerly, and with so much\r\nappearance of being refreshed that Nanty Ewart swore he would have\r\nsome too, and only laced it, as his phrase went, with a single glass of\r\nbrandy. [See Note 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED\r\n\r\nWe left Alan Fairford on the deck of the little smuggling brig, in that\r\ndisconsolate situation, when sickness and nausea, attack a heated and\r\nfevered frame, and an anxious mind. His share of sea-sickness, however,\r\nwas not so great as to engross his sensations entirely, or altogether\r\nto divert his attention from what was passing around. If he could not\r\ndelight in the swiftness and agility with which the \'little frigate\'\r\nwalked the waves, or amuse himself by noticing the beauty of the\r\nsea-views around him, where the distant Skiddaw raised his brow, as if\r\nin defiance of the clouded eminence of Criffel, which lorded it over the\r\nScottish side of the estuary, he had spirits and composure enough to pay\r\nparticular attention to the master of the vessel, on whose character his\r\nown safety in all probability was dependent.\r\n\r\nNanty Ewart had now given the helm to one of his people, a bald-pated,\r\ngrizzled old fellow, whose whole life had been spent in evading\r\nthe revenue laws, with now and then the relaxation of a few months\'\r\nimprisonment, for deforcing officers, resisting seizures, and the like\r\noffences.\r\n\r\nNanty himself sat down by Fairford, helped him to his tea, with such\r\nother refreshments as he could think of, and seemed in his way sincerely\r\ndesirous to make his situation as comfortable as things admitted.\r\nFairford had thus an opportunity to study his countenance and manners\r\nmore closely.\r\n\r\nIt was plain, Ewart, though a good seaman, had not been bred upon that\r\nelement. He was a reasonably good scholar, and seemed fond of showing it\r\nby recurring to the subject of Sallust and Juvenal; while, on the other\r\nhand, sea-phrases seldom chequered his conversation. He had been in\r\nperson what is called a smart little man; but the tropical sun had burnt\r\nhis originally fair complexion to a dusty red; and the bile which was\r\ndiffused through his system, had stained it with a yellowish black--what\r\nought to have been the white part of his eyes, in particular, had a hue\r\nas deep as the topaz. He was very thin, or rather emaciated, and his\r\ncountenance, though still indicating alertness and activity, showed a\r\nconstitution exhausted with excessive use of his favourite stimulus.\r\n\r\n\'I see you look at me hard,\' said he to Fairford. \'Had you been an\r\nofficer of the d--d customs, my terriers\' backs would have been up. He\r\nopened his breast, and showed Alan a pair of pistols disposed between\r\nhis waistcoat and jacket, placing his finger at the same time upon the\r\ncock of one of them. \'But come, you are an honest fellow, though you\'re\r\na close one. I dare say you think me a queer customer; but I can tell\r\nyou, they that see the ship leave harbour know little of the seas she\r\nis to sail through. My father, honest old gentleman, never would have\r\nthought to see me master of the JUMPING JENNY.\'\r\n\r\nFairford said, it seemed very clear indeed that Mr. Ewart\'s education\r\nwas far superior to the line he at present occupied.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Criffel to Solway Moss!\' said the other. Why, man, I should have\r\nbeen an expounder of the word, with a wig like a snow-wreath, and a\r\nstipend like--like--like a hundred pounds a year, I suppose. I can spend\r\nthrice as much as that, though, being such as I am. Here he sang a scrap\r\nof an old Northumbrian ditty, mimicking the burr of the natives of that\r\ncounty:--\r\n\r\n  \'Willy Foster\'s gone to sea,\r\n   Siller buckles at his knee,\r\n   He\'ll come back and marry me--\r\n              Canny Willy Foster.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have no doubt,\' said Fairford, \'your present occupation is more\r\nlucrative; \'but I should have thought the Church might have been more\'--\r\n\r\nHe stopped, recollecting that it was not his business to say anything\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n\'More respectable, you mean, I suppose?\' said Ewart, with a sneer, and\r\nsquirting the tobacco-juice through his front teeth; then was silent for\r\na moment, and proceeded in a tone of candour which some internal touch\r\nof conscience dictated. \'And so it would, Mr. Fairford--and happier,\r\ntoo, by a thousand degrees--though I have had my pleasures too. But\r\nthere was my father (God bless the old man!) a true chip of the old\r\nPresbyterian block, walked his parish like a captain on the quarterdeck,\r\nand was always ready to do good to rich and poor--Off went the laird\'s\r\nhat to the minister, as fast as the poor man\'s bonnet. When the eye saw\r\nhim--Pshaw! what have I to do with that now?--Yes, he was, as Virgil\r\nhath it, "VIR SAPIENTIA ET PIETATE GRAVIS." But he might have been the\r\nwiser man, had he kept me at home, when he sent me at nineteen to study\r\nDivinity at the head of the highest stair in the Covenant Close. It\r\nwas a cursed mistake in the old gentleman. What though Mrs. Cantrips of\r\nKittlebasket (for she wrote herself no less) was our cousin five\r\ntimes removed, and took me on that account to board and lodging at six\r\nshillings instead of seven shillings a week? it was a d--d bad saving,\r\nas the case proved. Yet her very dignity might have kept me in order;\r\nfor she never read a chapter excepting out of a Cambridge Bible, printed\r\nby Daniel, and bound in embroidered velvet. I think I see it at this\r\nmoment! And on Sundays, when we had a quart of twopenny ale, instead\r\nof butter-milk, to our porridge, it was always served up in a silver\r\nposset-dish. Also she used silver-mounted spectacles, whereas even my\r\nfather\'s were cased in mere horn. These things had their impression at\r\nfirst, but we get used to grandeur by degrees. Well, sir!--Gad, I can\r\nscarce get on with my story--it sticks in my throat--must take a trifle\r\nto wash it down. Well, this dame had a daughter--Jess Cantrips, a\r\nblack-eyed, bouncing wench--and, as the devil would have it, there was\r\nthe d--d five-story stair--her foot was never from it, whether I went\r\nout or came home from the Divinity Hall. I would have eschewed her,\r\nsir--I would, on my soul; for I was as innocent a lad as ever came from\r\nLammermuir; but there was no possibility of escape, retreat, or flight,\r\nunless I could have got a pair of wings, or made use of a ladder seven\r\nstories high, to scale the window of my attic. It signifies little\r\ntalking--you may suppose how all this was to end--I would have married\r\nthe girl, and taken my chance--I would, by Heaven! for she was a pretty\r\ngirl, and a good girl, till she and I met; but you know the old song,\r\n"Kirk would not let us be." A gentleman, in my case, would have settled\r\nthe matter with the kirk-treasurer for a small sum of money; but the\r\npoor stibbler, the penniless dominie, having married his cousin of\r\nKittlebasket, must next have proclaimed her frailty to the whole parish,\r\nby mounting the throne of Presbyterian penance, and proving, as Othello\r\nsays, "his love a whore," in face of the whole congregation.\r\n\r\n\'In this extremity I dared not stay where I was, and so thought to go\r\nhome to my father. But first I got Jack Radaway, a lad from the same\r\nparish, and who lived in the same infernal stair, to make some inquiries\r\nhow the old gentleman had taken the matter. I soon, by way of answer,\r\nlearned, to the great increase of my comfortable reflections, that the\r\ngood old man made as much clamour as if such a thing as a man\'s eating\r\nhis wedding dinner without saying grace had never happened since Adam\'s\r\ntime. He did nothing for six days but cry out, "Ichabod, Ichabod, the\r\nglory is departed from my house!" and on the seventh he preached a\r\nsermon, in which he enlarged on this incident as illustrative of one of\r\nthe great occasions for humiliation, and causes of national defection. I\r\nhope the course he took comforted himself--I am sure it made me ashamed\r\nto show my nose at home. So I went down to Leith, and, exchanging my\r\nhoddin grey coat of my mother\'s spinning for such a jacket as this, I\r\nentered my name at the rendezvous as an able-bodied landsman, and\r\nsailed with the tender round to Plymouth, where they were fitting out\r\na squadron for the West Indies. There I was put aboard the FEARNOUGHT,\r\nCaptain Daredevil--among whose crew I soon learned to fear Satan (the\r\nterror of my early youth) as little as the toughest Jack on board. I had\r\nsome qualms at first, but I took the remedy\' (tapping the case-bottle)\r\n\'which I recommend to you, being as good for sickness of the soul as for\r\nsickness of the stomach--What, you won\'t?--very well, I must, then--here\r\nis to ye.\'\r\n\r\n\'You would, I am afraid, find your education of little use in your new\r\ncondition?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Pardon me, sir,\' resumed the captain of the JUMPING JENNY; \'my handful\r\nof Latin, and small pinch of Greek, were as useless as old junk, to be\r\nsure; but my reading, writing and accompting, stood me in good stead,\r\nand brought me forward; I might have been schoolmaster--aye, and master,\r\nin time; but that valiant liquor, rum, made a conquest of me rather too\r\noften, and so, make what sail I could, I always went to leeward. We were\r\nfour years broiling in that blasted climate, and I came back at last\r\nwith a little prize-money. I always had thoughts of putting things to\r\nrights in the Covenant Close, and reconciling myself to my father. I\r\nfound out Jack Hadaway, who was TUPTOWING away with a dozen of wretched\r\nboys, and a fine string of stories he had ready to regale my ears\r\nwithal. My father had lectured on what he called "my falling away," for\r\nseven Sabbaths, when, just as his parishioners began to hope that the\r\ncourse was at an end, he was found dead in his bed on the eighth Sunday\r\nmorning. Jack Hadaway assured me, that if I wished to atone for my\r\nerrors, by undergoing the fate of the first martyr, I had only to go\r\nto my native village, where the very stones of the street would rise\r\nup against me as my father\'s murderer. Here was a pretty item--well, my\r\ntongue clove to my mouth for an hour, and was only able at last to\r\nutter the name of Mrs. Cantrips. Oh, this was a new theme for my Job\'s\r\ncomforter. My sudden departure--my father\'s no less sudden death--had\r\nprevented the payment of the arrears of my board and lodging--the\r\nlandlord was a haberdasher, with a heart as rotten as the muslin\r\nwares he dealt in. Without respect to her age or gentle kin, my Lady\r\nKittlebasket was ejected from her airy habitation--her porridge-pot,\r\nsilver posset-dish, silver-mounted spectacles, and Daniel\'s Cambridge\r\nBible, sold, at the Cross of Edinburgh, to the caddie who would bid\r\nhighest for them, and she herself driven to the workhouse, where she got\r\nin with difficulty, but was easily enough lifted out, at the end of the\r\nmonth, as dead as her friends could desire. Merry tidings this to me,\r\nwho had been the d----d\' (he paused a moment) \'ORIGO MALI--Gad, I think\r\nmy confession would sound better in Latin than in English!\r\n\r\n\'But the best jest was behind--I had just power to stammer out something\r\nabout Jess--by my faith he HAD an answer! I had taught Jess one trade,\r\nand, like a prudent girl, she had found out another for herself;\r\nunluckily, they were both contraband, and Jess Cantrips, daughter of the\r\nLady Kittlebasket, had the honour to be transported to the plantations,\r\nfor street-walking and pocket-picking, about six months before I touched\r\nshore.\'\r\n\r\nHe changed the bitter tone of affected pleasantry into an attempt to\r\nlaugh, then drew his swarthy hand across his swarthy eyes, and said in a\r\nmore natural accent, \'Poor Jess!\'\r\n\r\nThere was a pause--until Fairford, pitying the poor man\'s state of mind,\r\nand believing he saw something in him that, but for early error and\r\nsubsequent profligacy, might have been excellent and noble, helped on\r\nthe conversation by asking, in a tone of commiseration, how he had been\r\nable to endure such a load of calamity.\r\n\r\n\'Why, very well,\' answered the seaman; \'exceedingly well--like a tight\r\nship in a brisk gale. Let me recollect. I remember thanking Jack, very\r\ncomposedly, for the interesting and agreeable communication; I then\r\npulled out my canvas pouch, with my hoard of moidores, and taking out\r\ntwo pieces, I bid Jack keep the rest till I came back, as I was for a\r\ncruise about Auld Reekie. The poor devil looked anxiously, but I shook\r\nhim by the hand, and ran downstairs, in such confusion of mind, that\r\nnotwithstanding what I had heard, I expected to meet Jess at every\r\nturning.\r\n\r\nIt was market-day, and the usual number of rogues and fools were\r\nassembled at the Cross. I observed everybody looked strange on me, and I\r\nthought some laughed. I fancy I had been making queer faces enough, and\r\nperhaps talking to myself, When I saw myself used in this manner, I held\r\nout my clenched fists straight before me, stooped my head, and, like a\r\nram when he makes his race, darted off right down the street, scattering\r\ngroups of weatherbeaten lairds and periwigged burgesses, and bearing\r\ndown all before me. I heard the cry of "Seize the madman!" echoed, in\r\nCeltic sounds, from the City Guard, with "Ceaze ta matman!"--but pursuit\r\nand opposition were in vain. I pursued my career; the smell of the sea,\r\nI suppose, led me to Leith, where, soon after, I found myself walking\r\nvery quietly on the shore, admiring the tough round and sound cordage\r\nof the vessels, and thinking how a loop, with a man at the end of one of\r\nthem, would look, by way of tassel.\r\n\r\n\'I was opposite to the rendezvous, formerly my place of refuge--in\r\nI bolted--found one or two old acquaintances, made half a dozen\r\nnew ones--drank for two days--was put aboard the tender--off to\r\nPortsmouth--then landed at the Haslar hospital in a fine hissing-hot\r\nfever. Never mind--I got better--nothing can kill me--the West Indies\r\nwere my lot again, for since I did not go where I deserved in the\r\nnext world, I had something as like such quarters as can be had in\r\nthis--black devils for inhabitants--flames and earthquakes, and so\r\nforth, for your element. Well, brother, something or other I did or\r\nsaid--I can\'t tell what--How the devil should I, when I was as drunk\r\nas David\'s sow, you know? But I was punished, my lad--made to kiss the\r\nwench that never speaks but when she scolds, and that\'s the gunner\'s\r\ndaughter, comrade. Yes, the minister\'s son of no matter where--has the\r\ncat\'s scratch on his back! This roused me, and when we were ashore with\r\nthe boat, I gave three inches of the dirk, after a stout tussle, to the\r\nfellow I blamed most, and took the bush for it. There were plenty of\r\nwild lads then along shore--and, I don\'t care who knows--I went on the\r\naccount, look you--sailed under the black flag and marrow-bones--was a\r\ngood friend to the sea, and an enemy to all that sailed on it.\'\r\n\r\nFairford, though uneasy in his mind at finding himself, a lawyer, so\r\nclose to a character so lawless, thought it best, nevertheless, to put a\r\ngood face on the matter, and asked Mr. Ewart, with as much unconcern as\r\nhe could assume, \'whether he was fortunate as a rover?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no--d--n it, no,\' replied Nanty; \'the devil a crumb of butter was\r\never churned that would stick upon my bread. There was no order among\r\nus--he that was captain to-day, was swabber to-morrow; and as for\r\nplunder--they say old Avery, and one or two close hunks, made money; but\r\nin my time, all went as it came; and reason good, for if a fellow had\r\nsaved five dollars, his throat would have been cut in his hammock. And\r\nthen it was a cruel, bloody work.--Pah,--we\'ll say no more about it.\r\nI broke with them at last, for what they did on board of a bit of a\r\nsnow--no matter what it was bad enough, since it frightened me--I took\r\nFrench leave, and came in upon the proclamation, so I am free of all\r\nthat business. And here I sit, the skipper of the JUMPING JENNY--a\r\nnutshell of a thing, but goes through the water like a dolphin. If it\r\nwere not for yon hypocritical scoundrel at Annan, who has the best end\r\nof the profit, and takes none of the risk, I should be well enough--as\r\nwell as I want to be. Here is no lack of my best friend,\'--touching his\r\ncase-bottle;--\'but, to tell you a secret, he and I have got so used to\r\neach other, I begin to think he is like a professed joker, that makes\r\nyour sides sore with laughing if you see him but now and then; but if\r\nyou take up house with him, he can only make your head stupid. But I\r\nwarrant the old fellow is doing the best he can for me, after all.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what may that be?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'He is KILLING me,\' replied Nanty Ewart; \'and I am only sorry he is so\r\nlong about it.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying he jumped on his feet, and, tripping up and down the deck,\r\ngave his orders with his usual clearness and decision, notwithstanding\r\nthe considerable quantity of spirits which he had contrived to swallow\r\nwhile recounting his history.\r\n\r\nAlthough far from feeling well, Fairford endeavoured to rouse himself\r\nand walk to the head of the brig, to enjoy the beautiful prospect, as\r\nwell as to take some note of the course which the vessel held. To his\r\ngreat surprise, instead of standing across to the opposite shore\r\nfrom which she had departed, the brig was going down the Firth, and\r\napparently steering into the Irish Sea. He called to Nanty Ewart, and\r\nexpressed his surprise at the course they were pursuing, and asked\r\nwhy they did not stand straight across the Firth for some port in\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\n\'Why, this is what I call a reasonable question, now,\' answered Nanty;\r\n\'as if a ship could go as straight to its port as a horse to the stable,\r\nor a free-trader could sail the Solway as securely as a King\'s cutter!\r\nWhy, I\'ll tell ye, brother--if I do not see a smoke on Bowness, that\r\nis the village upon the headland yonder, I must stand out to sea for\r\ntwenty-four hours at least, for we must keep the weather-gage if there\r\nare hawks abroad.\'\r\n\r\n\'And if you do see the signal of safety, Master Ewart, what is to be\r\ndone then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why then, and in that case, I must keep off till night, and then run\r\nyou, with the kegs and the rest of the lumber, ashore at Skinburness,\'\r\n\r\n\'And then I am to meet with this same laird whom I have the letter for?\'\r\ncontinued Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'That,\' said Ewart, \'is thereafter as it may be; the ship has its\r\ncourse--the fair trader has his port--but it is not easy to say where\r\nthe laird may be found. But he will be within twenty miles of us, off or\r\non--and it will be my business to guide you to him.\'\r\n\r\nFairford could not withstand the passing impulse of terror which crossed\r\nhim, when thus reminded that he was so absolutely in the power of a man,\r\nwho, by his own account, had been a pirate, and who was at present, in\r\nall probability, an outlaw as well as a contraband trader. Nanty Ewart\r\nguessed the cause of his involuntary shuddering.\r\n\r\n\'What the devil should I gain,\' he said, \'by passing so poor a card as\r\nyou are? Have I not had ace of trumps in my hand, and did I not play it\r\nfairly? Aye, I say the JUMPING JENNY can run in other ware as well as\r\nkegs. Put SIGMA and TAU to Ewart, and see how that will spell--D\'ye take\r\nme now?\'\r\n\r\n\'No indeed,\' said Fairford; \'I am utterly ignorant of what you allude\r\nto.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, by Jove!\' said Nanty Ewart, \'thou art either the deepest or the\r\nshallowest fellow I ever met with--or you are not right after all. I\r\nwonder where Summertrees could pick up such a tender along-shore. Will\r\nyou let me see his letter?\'\r\n\r\nFairford did not hesitate to gratify his wish, which, he was aware, he\r\ncould not easily resist. The master of the JUMPING JENNY looked at\r\nthe direction very attentively, then turned the letter to and fro, and\r\nexamined each flourish of the pen, as if he were judging of a piece\r\nof ornamented manuscript; then handled it back to Fairford, without a\r\nsingle word of remark.\r\n\r\n\'Am I right now?\' said the young lawyer.\r\n\r\n\'Why, for that matter,\' answered Nanty, \'the letter is right, sure\r\nenough; but whether you are right or not, is your own business rather\r\nthan mine.\' And, striking upon a flint with the back of a knife, he\r\nkindled a cigar as thick as his finger, and began to smoke away with\r\ngreat perseverance.\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford continued to regard him with a melancholy feeling, divided\r\nbetwixt the interest he took in the unhappy man, and a not unnatural\r\napprehension for the issue of his own adventure.\r\n\r\nEwart, notwithstanding the stupefying nature of his pastime, seemed\r\nto guess what was working in his passenger\'s mind; for, after they had\r\nremained some time engaged in silently observing each other, he suddenly\r\ndashed his cigar on the deck, and said to him, \'Well then, if you are\r\nsorry for me, I am sorry for you. D--n me, if I have cared a button for\r\nman or mother\'s son, since two years since when I had another peep of\r\nJack Hadaway. \'The fellow was got as fat as a Norway whale--married to a\r\ngreat Dutch-built quean that had brought him six children. I believe\r\nhe did not know me, and thought I was come to rob his house; however, I\r\nmade up a poor face, and told him who I was. Poor Jack would have given\r\nme shelter and clothes, and began to tell me of the moidores that were\r\nin bank, when I wanted them. Egad, he changed his note when I told him\r\nwhat my life had been, and only wanted to pay me my cash and get rid\r\nof me. I never saw so terrified a visage. I burst out a-laughing in his\r\nface, told him it was all a humbug, and that the moidores were all his\r\nown, henceforth and for ever, and so ran off. I caused one of our people\r\nsend him a bag of tea and a keg of brandy, before I left--poor Jack!\r\nI think you are the second person these ten years, that has cared a\r\ntobacco-stopper for Nanty Ewart.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps, Mr. Ewart,\' said Fairford, \'you live chiefly with men too\r\ndeeply interested for their own immediate safety, to think much upon the\r\ndistress of others?\'\r\n\r\n\'And with whom do you yourself consort, I pray?\' replied Nanty, smartly.\r\n\'Why, with plotters, that can make no plot to better purpose than their\r\nown hanging; and incendiaries, that are snapping the flint upon wet\r\ntinder. You\'ll as soon raise the dead as raise the Highlands--you\'ll as\r\nsoon get a grunt from a dead sow as any comfort from Wales or Cheshire.\r\nYou think because the pot is boiling, that no scum but yours can come\r\nuppermost--I know better, by--. All these rackets and riots that you\r\nthink are trending your way have no relation at all to your interest;\r\nand the best way to make the whole kingdom friends again at once, would\r\nbe the alarm of such an undertaking as these mad old fellows are trying\r\nto launch into.\r\n\r\n\'I really am not in such secrets as you seem to allude to,\' said\r\nFairford; and, determined at the same time to avail himself as far as\r\npossible of Nanty\'s communicative disposition, he added, with a smile,\'\r\nAnd if I were, I should not hold it prudent to make them much the\r\nsubject of conversation. But I am sure, so sensible a man as Summertrees\r\nand the laird may correspond together without offence to the state.\'\r\n\r\n\'I take you, friend--I take you,\' said Nanty Ewart, upon whom, at\r\nlength, the liquor and tobacco-smoke began to make considerable\r\ninnovation. \'As to what gentlemen may or may not correspond about, why\r\nwe may pretermit the question, as the old professor used to say at the\r\nHall; and as to Summertrees, I will say nothing, knowing him to be an\r\nold fox. But I say that this fellow the laird is a firebrand in the\r\ncountry; that he is stirring up all the honest fellows who should be\r\ndrinking their brandy quietly, by telling them stories about their\r\nancestors and the Forty-five; and that he is trying to turn all waters\r\ninto his own mill-dam, and to set his sails to all winds. And because\r\nthe London people are roaring about for some pinches of their own,\r\nhe thinks to win them to his turn with a wet finger. And he gets\r\nencouragement from some, because they want a spell of money from him;\r\nand from others, because they fought for the cause once and are ashamed\r\nto go back; and others, because they have nothing to lose; and others,\r\nbecause they are discontented fools. But if he has brought you, or any\r\none, I say not whom, into this scrape, with the hope of doing any good,\r\nhe\'s a d--d decoy-duck, and that\'s all I can say for him; and you are\r\ngeese, which is worse than being decoy-ducks, or lame-ducks either.\r\nAnd so here is to the prosperity of King George the Third, and the true\r\nPresbyterian religion, and confusion to the Pope, the Devil, and the\r\nPretender! I\'ll tell you what, Mr. Fairbairn, I am but tenth owner of\r\nthis bit of a craft, the JUMPING JENNY--but tenth owner and must sail\r\nher by my owners\' directions. But if I were whole owner, I would not\r\nhave the brig be made a ferry-boat for your Jacobitical, old-fashioned\r\nPopish riff-raff, Mr. Fairport--I would not, by my soul; they should\r\nwalk the plank, by the gods, as I have seen better men do when I sailed\r\nunder the What-d\'ye-callum colours. But being contraband goods, and on\r\nboard my vessel, and I with my sailing orders in my hand, why, I am to\r\nforward them as directed--I say, John Roberts, keep her up a bit with\r\nthe helm.--and so, Mr. Fairweather, what I do is--as the d--d villain\r\nTurnpenny says--all in the way of business.\'\r\n\r\nHe had been speaking with difficulty for the last five minutes, and\r\nnow at length dropped on the deck, fairly silenced by the quantity of\r\nspirits which he had swallowed, but without having showed any glimpse of\r\nthe gaiety, or even of the extravagance, of intoxication.\r\n\r\nThe old sailor stepped forward and flung a sea-cloak over the\r\nslumberer\'s shoulders, and added, looking at Fairford, \'Pity of him he\r\nshould have this fault; for without it, he would have been as clever a\r\nfellow as ever trod a plank with ox leather.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what are we to do now?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Stand off and on, to be sure, till we see the signal, and then obey\r\norders.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, the old man turned to his duty, and left the passenger to\r\namuse himself with his own meditations. Presently afterward a light\r\ncolumn of smoke was seen rising from the little headland.\r\n\r\n\'I can tell you what we are to do now, master,\' said the sailor. \'We\'ll\r\nstand out to sea, and then run in again with the evening tide, and\r\nmake Skinburness; or, if there\'s not light, we can run into the\r\nWampool river, and put you ashore about Kirkbride or Leaths, with the\r\nlong-boat.\'\r\n\r\nFairford, unwell before, felt this destination condemned him to an agony\r\nof many hours, which his disordered stomach and aching head were ill\r\nable to endure. There was no remedy, however, but patience, and the\r\nrecollection that he was suffering in the cause of friendship. As the\r\nsun rose high, he became worse; his sense of smell appeared to acquire\r\na morbid degree of acuteness, for the mere purpose of inhaling and\r\ndistinguishing all the various odours with which he was surrounded, from\r\nthat of pitch to all the complicated smells of the hold. His heart, too,\r\nthrobbed under the heat, and he felt as if in full progress towards a\r\nhigh fever.\r\n\r\nThe seamen, who were civil and attentive considering their calling,\r\nobserved his distress, and one contrived to make an awning out of an\r\nold sail, while another compounded some lemonade, the only liquor which\r\ntheir passenger could be prevailed upon to touch. After drinking it off,\r\nhe obtained, but could not be said to enjoy, a few hours of troubled\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford\'s spirit was more ready to encounter labour than his frame\r\nwas adequate to support it. In spite of his exertions, when he awoke,\r\nafter five or six hours\' slumber, he found that he was so much disabled\r\nby dizziness in his head and pains in his limbs, that he could not raise\r\nhimself without assistance. He heard with some pleasure that they were\r\nnow running right for the Wampool river, and that he would be put on\r\nshore in a very short time. The vessel accordingly lay to, and presently\r\nshowed a weft in her ensign, which was hastily answered by signals from\r\non shore. Men and horses were seen to come down the broken path which\r\nleads to the shore; the latter all properly tackled for carrying their\r\nloading. Twenty fishing barks were pushed afloat at once, and crowded\r\nround the brig with much clamour, laughter, cursing, and jesting. Amidst\r\nall this apparent confusion there was the essential regularity. Nanty\r\nEwart again walked his quarter-deck as if he had never tasted spirits\r\nin his life, issued the necessary orders with precision, and saw them\r\nexecuted with punctuality. In half an hour the loading of the brig was\r\nin a great measure disposed in the boats; in a quarter of an hour more,\r\nit was landed on the beach, and another interval of about the same\r\nduration was sufficient to distribute it on the various strings of\r\npackhorses which waited for that purpose, and which instantly dispersed,\r\neach on its own proper adventure. More mystery was observed in loading\r\nthe ship\'s boat with a quantity of small barrels, which seemed to\r\ncontain ammunition. This was not done until the commercial customers\r\nhad been dismissed; and it was not until this was performed that Ewart\r\nproposed to Alan, as he lay stunned with pain and noise, to accompany\r\nhim ashore.\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that Fairford could get over the side of the\r\nvessel, and he could not seat himself on the stern of the boat without\r\nassistance from the captain and his people. Nanty Ewart, who saw nothing\r\nin this worse than an ordinary fit of sea-sickness, applied the usual\r\ntopics of consolation. He assured his passenger that he would be quite\r\nwell by and by, when he had been half an hour on terra firma, and\r\nthat he hoped to drink a can and smoke a pipe with him at Father\r\nCrackenthorp\'s, for all that he felt a little out of the way for riding\r\nthe wooden horse.\r\n\r\n\'Who is Father Crackenthorp?\' said Fairford, though scarcely able to\r\narticulate the question.\r\n\r\n\'As honest a fellow as is of a thousand,\' answered Nanty.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, how much good brandy he and I have made little of in our day! By my\r\nsoul, Mr. Fairbird, he is the prince of skinkers, and the father of\r\nthe free trade--not a stingy hypocritical devil like old Turnpenny\r\nSkinflint, that drinks drunk on other folk\'s cost, and thinks it sin\r\nwhen he has to pay for it--but a real hearty old cock;--the sharks have\r\nbeen at and about him this many a day, but Father Crackenthorp knows how\r\nto trim his sails--never a warrant but he hears of it before the ink\'s\r\ndry. He is BONUS SOCIUS with headborough and constable. The king\'s\r\nexchequer could not bribe a man to inform against him. If any such\r\nrascal were to cast up, why, he would miss his ears next morning, or\r\nbe sent to seek them in the Solway. He is a statesman, [A small landed\r\nproprietor.] though he keeps a public; but, indeed, that is only for\r\nconvenience and to excuse his having cellarage and folk about him; his\r\nwife\'s a canny woman--and his daughter Doll too. Gad, you\'ll be in port\r\nthere till you get round again; and I\'ll keep my word with you, and\r\nbring you to speech of the laird.\r\n\r\nGad, the only trouble I shall have is to get you out of the house;\r\nfor Doll is a rare wench, and my dame a funny old one, and Father\r\nCrackenthorp the rarest companion! He\'ll drink you a bottle of rum or\r\nbrandy without starting, but never wet his lips with the nasty Scottish\r\nstuff that the canting old scoundrel Turnpenny has brought into fashion.\r\nHe is a gentleman, every inch of him, old Crackenthorp; in his own way,\r\nthat is; and besides, he has a share in the JUMPING JENNY, and many a\r\nmoonlight outfit besides. He can give Doll a pretty penny, if he likes\r\nthe tight fellow that would turn in with her for life.\'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this prolonged panegyric on Father Crackenthorp, the\r\nboat touched the beach, the rowers backed their oars to keep her afloat,\r\nwhilst the other fellows lumped into the surf, and, with the most rapid\r\ndexterity, began to hand the barrels ashore.\r\n\r\n\'Up with them higher on the beach, my hearties,\' exclaimed Nanty\r\nEwart--\'High and dry--high and dry--this gear will not stand wetting.\r\nNow, out with our spare hand here--high and dry with him too.\r\nWhat\'s that?--the galloping of horse! Oh, I hear the jingle of the\r\npacksaddles--they are our own folk.\'\r\n\r\nBy this time all the boat\'s load was ashore, consisting of the little\r\nbarrels; and the boat\'s crew, standing to their arms, ranged themselves\r\nin front, waiting the advance of the horses which came clattering along\r\nthe beach. A man, overgrown with corpulence, who might be distinguished\r\nin the moonlight panting with his own exertions, appeared at the head\r\nof the cavalcade, which consisted of horses linked together, and\r\naccommodated with packsaddles, and chains for securing the kegs which\r\nmade a dreadful clattering.\r\n\r\n\'How now, Father Crackenthorp?\' said Ewart--\'Why this hurry with your\r\nhorses? We mean to stay a night with you, and taste your old brandy, and\r\nmy dame\'s homebrewed. The signal is up, man, and all is right.\'\r\n\r\n\'All is wrong, Captain Nanty,\' cried the man to whom he spoke; \'and you\r\nare the lad that is like to find it so, unless you bundle off--there are\r\nnew brooms bought at Carlisle yesterday to sweep the country of you and\r\nthe like of you--so you were better be jogging inland.\r\n\r\n\'How many rogues are the officers? If not more than ten, I will make\r\nfight.\'\r\n\r\n\'The devil you will!\' answered Crackenthorp. \'You were better not, for\r\nthey have the bloody-backed dragoons from Carlisle with them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, then,\' said Nanty, \'we must make sail. Come, Master Fairlord,\r\nyou must mount and ride. He does not hear me--he has fainted, I\r\nbelieve--What the devil shall I do? Father Crackenthorp, I must leave\r\nthis young fellow with you till the gale blows out--hark ye--goes\r\nbetween the laird and the t\'other old one; he can neither ride nor\r\nwalk--I must send him up to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Send him up to the gallows!\' said Crackenthorp; \'there is Quartermaster\r\nThwacker, with twenty men, up yonder; an he had not some kindness for\r\nDoll, I had never got hither for a start--but you must get off, or they\r\nwill be here to seek us, for his orders are woundy particular; and these\r\nkegs contain worse than whisky--a hanging matter, I take it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish they were at the bottom of Wampool river, with them they belong\r\nto,\' said Nanty Ewart. \'But they are part of cargo; and what to do with\r\nthe poor young fellow--\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, many a better fellow has roughed it on the grass with a cloak o\'er\r\nhim,\' said Crackenthorp. \'If he hath a fever, nothing is so cooling as\r\nthe night air.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he would be cold enough in the morning, no doubt; but it\'s a kind\r\nheart and shall not cool so soon if I can help it,\' answered the captain\r\nof the JUMPING JENNY.\r\n\r\n\'Well, captain, an ye will risk your own neck for another man\'s, why not\r\ntake him to the old girls at Fairladies?\'\r\n\r\n\'What, the Miss Arthurets! The Papist jades! But never mind; it will\r\ndo--I have known them take in a whole sloop\'s crew that were stranded on\r\nthe sands.\'\r\n\r\n\'You may run some risk, though, by turning up to Fairladies; for I tell\r\nyou they are all up through the country.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind--I may chance to put some of them down again,\' said Nanty,\r\ncheerfully. \'Come, lads, bustle to your tackle. Are you all loaded?\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye, captain; we will be ready in a jiffy,\' answered the gang.\r\n\r\n\'D--n your captains! Have you a mind to have me hanged if I am taken?\r\nAll\'s hail-fellow, here.\'\r\n\r\n\'A sup at parting,\' said Father Crackenthorp, extending a flask to Nanty\r\nEwart.\r\n\r\n\'Not the twentieth part of a drop,\' said Nanty. \'No Dutch courage for\r\nme--my heart is always high enough when there\'s a chance of fighting;\r\nbesides, if I live drunk, I should like to die sober. Here, old\r\nJephson--you are the best-natured brute amongst them--get the lad\r\nbetween us on a quiet horse, and we will keep him upright, I warrant.\'\r\n\r\nAs they raised Fairford from the ground, he groaned heavily, and asked\r\nfaintly where they were taking him to.\r\n\r\n\'To a place where you will be as snug and quiet as a mouse in his hole,\'\r\nsaid Nanty, \'if so be that we can get you there safely. Good-bye, Father\r\nCrackenthorp--poison the quartermaster, if you can.\'\r\n\r\nThe loaded horses then sprang forward at a hard trot, following each\r\nother in a line, and every second horse being mounted by a stout fellow\r\nin a smock frock, which served to conceal the arms with which most of\r\nthese desperate men were provided. Ewart followed in the rear of the\r\nline, and, with the occasional assistance of old Jephson, kept his young\r\ncharge erect in the saddle. He groaned heavily from time to time; and\r\nEwart, more moved with compassion for his situation than might have been\r\nexpected from his own habits, endeavoured to amuse him and comfort him,\r\nby some account of the place to which they were conveying him--his words\r\nof consolation being, however, frequently interrupted by the necessity\r\nof calling to his people, and many of them being lost amongst the\r\nrattling of the barrels, and clinking of the tackle and small chains by\r\nwhich they are secured on such occasions.\r\n\r\n\'And you see, brother, you will be in safe quarters at Fairladies--good\r\nold scrambling house--good old maids enough, if they were not\r\nPapists,--Hollo, you Jack Lowther; keep the line, can\'t ye, and shut\r\nyour rattle-trap, you broth of a--? And so, being of a good family, and\r\nhaving enough, the old lasses have turned a kind of saints, and nuns,\r\nand so forth. The place they live in was some sort of nun-shop long ago,\r\nas they have them still in Flanders; so folk call them the Vestals of\r\nFairladies--that may be, or may not be; and I care not whether it be or\r\nno.--Blinkinsop, hold your tongue, and be d--d!--And so, betwixt great\r\nalms and good dinners, they are well thought of by rich and poor, and\r\ntheir trucking with Papists is looked over. There are plenty of priests,\r\nand stout young scholars, and such-like, about the house it\'s a hive of\r\nthem. More shame that government send dragoons out after-a few honest\r\nfellows that bring the old women of England a drop of brandy, and let\r\nthese ragamuffins smuggle in as much papistry and--Hark!--was that\r\na whistle? No, it\'s only a plover. You, Jem Collier, keep a look-out\r\nahead--we\'ll meet them at the High Whins, or Brotthole bottom, or\r\nnowhere. Go a furlong ahead, I say, and look sharp.--These Misses\r\nArthurets feed the hungry, and clothe the naked, and such-like\r\nacts--which my poor father used to say were filthy rags, but he dressed\r\nhimself out with as many of them as most folk.--D--n that stumbling\r\nhorse! Father Crackenthorp should be d--d himself for putting an honest\r\nfellow\'s neck in such jeopardy.\'\r\n\r\nThus, and with much more to the same purpose, Nanty ran on, increasing,\r\nby his well-intended annoyance, the agony of Alan Fairford, who,\r\ntormented by a racking pain along the back and loins, which made the\r\nrough trot of the horse torture to him, had his aching head still\r\nfurther rended and split by the hoarse voice of the sailor, close to\r\nhis ear. Perfectly passive, however, he did not even essay to give\r\nany answer; and indeed his own bodily distress was now so great and\r\nengrossing, that to think of his situation was impossible, even if he\r\ncould have mended it by doing so.\r\n\r\nTheir course was inland; but in what direction, Alan had no means of\r\nascertaining. They passed at first over heaths and sandy downs; they\r\ncrossed more than one brook, or beck, as they are called in that\r\ncountry--some of them of considerable depth--and at length reached\r\na cultivated country, divided, according to the English fashion of\r\nagriculture, into very small fields or closes, by high banks, overgrown\r\nwith underwood, and surmounted by hedge-row trees, amongst which winded\r\na number of impracticable and complicated lanes, where the boughs\r\nprojecting from the embankments on each side, intercepted the light of\r\nthe moon, and endangered the safety of the horsemen. But through this\r\nlabyrinth the experience of the guides conducted them without a blunder,\r\nand without even the slackening of their pace. In many places, however,\r\nit was impossible for three men to ride abreast; and therefore the\r\nburden of supporting Alan Fairford fell alternately to old Jephson\r\nand to Nanty; and it was with much difficulty that they could keep him\r\nupright in his saddle.\r\n\r\nAt length, when his powers of sufferance were quite worn out, and he was\r\nabout to implore them to leave him to his fate in the first cottage or\r\nshed--or under a haystack or a hedge--or anywhere, so he was left at\r\nease, Collier, who rode ahead, passed back the word that they were at\r\nthe avenue to Fairladies--\'Was he to turn up?\'\r\n\r\nCommitting the charge of Fairford to Jephson, Nanty dashed up to the\r\nhead of the troop, and gave his orders.--\'Who knows the house best?\'\r\n\r\n\'Sam Skelton\'s a Catholic,\' said Lowther.\r\n\r\n\'A d--d bad religion,\' said Nanty, of whose Presbyterian education a\r\nhatred of Popery seemed to be the only remnant. \'But I am glad there is\r\none amongst us, anyhow. You, Sam, being a Papist, know Fairladies and\r\nthe old maidens I dare say; so do you fall out of the line, and wait\r\nhere with me; and do you, Collier, carry on to Walinford bottom, then\r\nturn down the beck till you come to the old mill, and Goodman Grist the\r\nMiller, or old Peel-the-Causeway, will tell you where to stow; but I\r\nwill be up with you before that.\'\r\n\r\nThe string of loaded horses then struck forward at their former pace,\r\nwhile Nanty, with Sam Skelton, waited by the roadside till the rear came\r\nup, when Jephson and Fairford joined them, and, to the great relief\r\nof the latter, they began to proceed at an easier pace than formerly,\r\nsuffering the gang to precede them, till the clatter and clang attending\r\ntheir progress began to die away in the distance. They had not proceeded\r\na pistol-shot from the place where they parted, when a short turning\r\nbrought them in front of an old mouldering gateway, whose heavy\r\npinnacles were decorated in the style of the seventeenth century, with\r\nclumsy architectural ornaments; several of which had fallen down from\r\ndecay, and lay scattered about, no further care having been taken than\r\njust to remove them out of the direct approach to the avenue. The great\r\nstone pillars, glimmering white in the moonlight, had some fanciful\r\nresemblance to supernatural apparitions, and the air of neglect all\r\naround, gave an uncomfortable idea of the habitation to those who passed\r\nits avenue.\r\n\r\n\'There used to be no gate here,\' said Skelton, finding their way\r\nunexpectedly stopped.\r\n\r\n\'But there is a gate now, and a porter too,\' said a rough voice from\r\nwithin. \'Who be you, and what do you want at this time of night?\'\r\n\r\n\'We want to come to speech of the ladies--of the Misses Arthuret,\' said\r\nNanty; \'and to ask lodging for a sick man.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no speech to be had of the Miss Arthurets at this time of\r\nnight, and you may carry your sick man to the doctor,\' answered the\r\nfellow from within, gruffly; \'for as sure as there is savour in salt,\r\nand scent in rosemary, you will get no entrance--put your pipes up and\r\nbe jogging on.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, Dick Gardener,\' said Skelton, \'be thou then turned porter?\'\r\n\r\n\'What, do you know who I am?\' said the domestic sharply.\r\n\r\n\'I know you, by your by-word,\' answered the other; \'What, have you\r\nforgot little Sam Skelton, and the brock in the barrel?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I have not forgotten you,\' answered the acquaintance of Sam\r\nSkelton; \'but my orders are peremptory to let no one up the avenue this\r\nnight, and therefore\'--\r\n\r\n\'But we are armed, and will not be kept back,\' said Nanty. \'Hark ye,\r\nfellow, were it not better for you to take a guinea and let us in, than\r\nto have us break the door first, and thy pate afterwards? for I won\'t\r\nsee my comrade die at your door be assured of that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I dunna know,\' said the fellow; \'but what cattle were those that\r\nrode by in such hurry?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, some of our folk from Bowness, Stoniecultrum, and thereby,\'\r\nanswered Skelton; \'Jack Lowther, and old Jephson, and broad Will\r\nLamplugh, and such like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Dick Gardener, \'as sure as there is savour in salt, and\r\nscent in rosemary, I thought it had been the troopers from Carlisle and\r\nWigton, and the sound brought my heart to my mouth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Had thought thou wouldst have known the clatter of a cask from the\r\nclash of a broadsword, as well as e\'er a quaffer in Cumberland,\' said\r\nSkelton.\r\n\r\n\'Come, brother, less of your jaw and more of your legs, if you please,\'\r\nsaid Nanty; \'every moment we stay is a moment lost. Go to the ladies,\r\nand tell them that Nanty Ewart, of the JUMPING JENNY, has brought\r\na young gentleman, charged with letters from Scotland to a certain\r\ngentleman of consequence in Cumberland--that the soldiers are out, and\r\nthe gentleman is very ill and if he is not received at Fairladies he\r\nmust be left either to die at the gate, or to be taken, with all his\r\npapers about him, by the redcoats.\'\r\n\r\nAway ran Dick Gardener with this message; and, in a few minutes, lights\r\nwere seen to flit about, which convinced Fairford, who was now, in\r\nconsequence of the halt, a little restored to self-possession, that they\r\nwere traversing the front of a tolerably large mansion-house.\r\n\r\n\'What if thy friend, Dick Gardener, comes not back again?\' said Jephson\r\nto Skelton.\r\n\r\n\'Why, then,\' said the person addressed, \'I shall owe him just such a\r\nlicking as thou, old Jephson, had from Dan Cooke, and will pay as duly\r\nand truly as he did.\'\r\n\r\nThe old man was about to make an angry reply, when his doubts were\r\nsilenced by the return of Dick Gardener, who announced that Miss\r\nArthuret was coming herself as far as the gateway to speak with them.\r\n\r\nNanty Ewart cursed in a low tone the suspicions of old maids and the\r\nchurlish scruples of Catholics, that made so many obstacles to helping\r\na fellow creature, and wished Miss Arthuret a hearty rheumatism or\r\ntoothache as the reward of her excursion; but the lady presently\r\nappeared, to cut short further grumbling. She was attended by a\r\nwaiting-maid with a lantern, by means of which she examined the party\r\non the outside, as closely as the imperfect light, and the spars of the\r\nnewly-erected gate, would permit.\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry we have disturbed you so late, Madam Arthuret,\' said Nanty;\r\n\'but the case is this\'--\r\n\r\n\'Holy Virgin,\' said she, \'why do you speak so loud? Pray, are you not\r\nthe captain of the SAINTE GENEVIEVE?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, aye, ma\'am,\' answered Ewart, \'they call the brig so at Dunkirk,\r\nsure enough; but along shore here, they call her the JUMPING JENNY.\'\r\n\r\n\'You brought over the holy Father Buonaventure, did you not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, aye, madam, I have brought over enough of them black cattle,\'\r\nanswered Nanty. \'Fie! fie! friend,\' said Miss Arthuret; \'it is a pity\r\nthat the saints should commit these good men to a heretic\'s care.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, no more they would, ma\'am,\' answered Nanty, \'could they find a\r\nPapist lubber that knew the coast as I do; then I am trusty as steel\r\nto owners, and always look after cargo--live lumber, or dead flesh,\r\nor spirits, all is one to me; and your Catholics have such d--d large\r\nhoods, with pardon, ma\'am, that they can sometimes hide two faces under\r\nthem. But here is a gentleman dying, with letters about him from the\r\nLaird of Summertrees to the Laird of the Lochs, as they call him, along\r\nSolway, and every minute he lies here is a nail in his coffin.\'\r\n\r\n\'Saint Mary! what shall we do?\' said Miss Arthuret; \'we must admit him,\r\nI think, at all risks. You, Richard Gardener, help one of these men to\r\ncarry the gentleman up to the Place; and you, Selby, see him lodged at\r\nthe end of the long gallery. You are a heretic, captain, but I think you\r\nare trusty, and I know you have been trusted--but if you are imposing on\r\nme\'--\r\n\r\n\'Not I, madam--never attempt to impose on ladies of your experience--my\r\npractice that way has been all among the young ones. Come, cheerly, Mr.\r\nFairford--you will be taken good care of--try to walk.\'\r\n\r\nAlan did so; and, refreshed by his halt, declared himself able to walk\r\nto the house with the sole assistance of the gardener.\r\n\r\n\'Why, that\'s hearty. Thank thee, Dick, for lending him thine arm\'--and\r\nNanty slipped into his hand the guinea he had promised.--\'Farewell,\r\nthen, Mr. Fairford, and farewell, Madam Arthuret, for I have been too\r\nlong here.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he and his two companions threw themselves on horseback, and\r\nwent off at a gallop. Yet, even above the clatter of their hoofs did the\r\nincorrigible Nanty hollo out the old ballad--\r\n\r\n  A lovely lass to a friar came,\r\n  To confession a-morning early;--\r\n  \'In what, my dear, are you to blame?\r\n  Come tell me most sincerely?\'\r\n  \'Alas!  my fault I dare not name--\r\n  But my lad he loved me dearly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Holy Virgin!\' exclaimed Miss Seraphina, as the unhallowed sounds\r\nreached her ears; \'what profane heathens be these men, and what frights\r\nand pinches we be put to among them! The saints be good to us, what a\r\nnight has this been!--the like never seen at Fairladies. Help me to make\r\nfast the gate, Richard, and thou shalt come down again to wait on it,\r\nlest there come more unwelcome visitors--Not that you are unwelcome,\r\nyoung gentleman, for it is sufficient that you need such assistance as\r\nwe can give you, to make you welcome to Fairladies--only, another time\r\nwould have done as well--but, hem! I dare say it is all for the best.\r\nThe avenue is none of the smoothest, sir, look to your feet. Richard\r\nGardener should have had it mown and levelled, but he was obliged to go\r\non a pilgrimage to Saint Winifred\'s Well, in Wales.\' (Here Dick gave\r\na short dry cough, which, as if he had found it betrayed some internal\r\nfeeling a little at variance with what the lady said, he converted into\r\na muttered SANCTA WINIFREDA, ORA PRO NOBIS. Miss Arthuret, meantime,\r\nproceeded) \'We never interfere with our servants\' vows or penances,\r\nMaster Fairford--I know a very worthy father of your name, perhaps a\r\nrelation--I say, we never interfere with our servants vows. Our Lady\r\nforbid they should not know some difference between our service and a\r\nheretic\'s.--Take care, sir, you will fall if you have not a care. Alas!\r\nby night and day there are many stumbling-blocks in our paths!\'\r\n\r\nWith more talk to the same purpose, all of which tended to show a\r\ncharitable and somewhat silly woman with a strong inclination to her\r\nsuperstitious devotion, Miss Arthuret entertained her new guest, as,\r\nstumbling at every obstacle which the devotion of his guide, Richard,\r\nhad left in the path, he at last, by ascending some stone steps\r\ndecorated on the side with griffins, or some such heraldic anomalies,\r\nattained a terrace extending in front of the Place of Fairladies; an\r\nold-fashioned gentleman\'s house of some consequence, with its range of\r\nnotched gable-ends and narrow windows, relieved by here and there an old\r\nturret about the size of a pepper-box. The door was locked during the\r\nbrief absence of the mistress; a dim light glimmered through the sashed\r\ndoor of the hall, which opened beneath a huge stone porch, loaded with\r\njessamine and other creepers. All the windows were dark as pitch.\r\n\r\nMiss Arthuret tapped at the door. \'Sister, sister Angelica.\' \'Who is\r\nthere?\' was answered from within; \'is it you, sister Seraphina?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, undo the door; do you not know my voice?\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt, sister,\' said Angelica, undoing bolt and bar; \'but you know\r\nour charge, and the enemy is watchful to surprise us--INCEDIT SICUT LEO\r\nVORANS, saith the breviary. Whom have you brought here? Oh, sister, what\r\nhave you done?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a young man,\' said Seraphina, hastening to interrupt her sister\'s\r\nremonstrance, \'a relation, I believe, of our worthy Father Fairford;\r\nleft at the gate by the captain of that blessed vessel the SAINTE\r\nGENEVIEVE--almost dead--and charged with dispatches to \'--\r\n\r\nShe lowered her voice as she mumbled over the last words.\r\n\r\n\'Nay, then, there is no help,\' said Angelica; \'but it is unlucky.\'\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue between the vestals of Fairladies, Dick Gardener\r\ndeposited his burden in a chair, where the young lady, after a moment\r\nof hesitation, expressing a becoming reluctance to touch the hand of a\r\nstranger, put her finger and thumb upon Fairford\'s wrist, and counted\r\nhis pulse.\r\n\r\n\'There is fever here, sister,\' she said; \'Richard must call Ambrose, and\r\nwe must send some of the febrifuge.\'\r\n\r\nAmbrose arrived presently, a plausible and respectable-looking old\r\nservant, bred in the family, and who had risen from rank to rank in\r\nthe Arthuret service till he was become half-physician, half-almoner,\r\nhalf-butler, and entire governor; that is, when the Father Confessor,\r\nwho frequently eased him of the toils of government, chanced to be\r\nabroad. Under the direction, and with the assistance of this venerable\r\npersonage, the unlucky Alan Fairford was conveyed to a decent apartment\r\nat the end of a long gallery, and, to his inexpressible relief,\r\nconsigned to a comfortable bed. He did not attempt to resist the\r\nprescription of Mr. Ambrose, who not only presented him with the\r\nproposed draught, but proceeded so far as to take a considerable\r\nquantity of blood from him, by which last operation he probably did his\r\npatient much service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED\r\n\r\nOn the next morning, when Fairford awoke, after no very refreshing\r\nslumbers, in which were mingled many wild dreams of his father and of\r\nDarsie Latimer,--of the damsel in the green mantle and the vestals of\r\nFairladies,--of drinking small beer with Nanty Ewart and being immersed\r\nin the Solway with the JUMPING JENNY,--he found himself in no condition\r\nto dispute the order of Mr. Ambrose, that he should keep his bed, from\r\nwhich, indeed, he could not have raised himself without assistance. He\r\nbecame sensible that his anxiety, and his constant efforts for some days\r\npast, had been too much for his health, and that, whatever might be his\r\nimpatience, he could not proceed in his undertaking until his strength\r\nwas re-established.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, no better quarters could have been found for an\r\ninvalid. The attendants spoke under their breath, and moved only on\r\ntiptoe--nothing was done unless PAR ORDONNANCE DU MEDECIN. Aesculapius\r\nreigned paramount in the premises at Fairladies. Once a day, the ladies\r\ncame in great state to wait upon him and inquire after his health, and\r\nit was then that; Alan\'s natural civility, and the thankfulness which\r\nhe expressed for their timely and charitable assistance, raised him\r\nconsiderably in their esteem. He was on the third day removed to a\r\nbetter apartment than that in which he had been at first accommodated.\r\nWhen he was permitted to drink a glass of wine, it was of the first\r\nquality; one of those curious old-fashioned cobwebbed bottles being\r\nproduced on the occasion, which are only to be found in the crypts of\r\nold country-seats, where they may have lurked undisturbed for more than\r\nhalf a century.\r\n\r\nBut however delightful a residence for an invalid, Fairladies, as\r\nits present inmate became soon aware, was not so agreeable to a\r\nconvalescent. When he dragged himself to the window so soon as he could\r\ncrawl from bed, behold it was closely grated, and commanded no view\r\nexcept of a little paved court. This was nothing remarkable, most\r\nold Border houses having their windows so secured. But then Fairford\r\nobserved, that whosoever entered or left the room always locked the\r\ndoor with great care and circumspection; and some proposals which he\r\nmade to take a walk in the gallery, or even in the garden, were so\r\ncoldly received, both by the ladies and their prime minister, Mr.\r\nAmbrose, that he saw plainly such an extension of his privileges as a\r\nguest would not be permitted.\r\n\r\nAnxious to ascertain whether this excessive hospitality would permit\r\nhim his proper privilege of free agency, he announced to this important\r\nfunctionary, with grateful thanks for the care with which he had been\r\nattended, his purpose to leave Fairladies next morning, requesting only,\r\nas a continuance of the favours with which he had been loaded, the\r\nloan of a horse to the next town; and, assuring Mr. Ambrose that his\r\ngratitude would not be limited by such, a trifle, he slipped three\r\nguineas into his hand, by way of seconding his proposal. The fingers of\r\nthat worthy domestic closed as naturally upon the honorarium, as if a\r\ndegree in the learned faculty had given him a right to clutch it; but\r\nhis answer concerning Alan\'s proposed departure was at first evasive,\r\nand when he was pushed, it amounted to a peremptory assurance that he\r\ncould not be permitted to depart to-morrow; it was as much as his life\r\nwas worth, and his ladies would not authorize it.\r\n\r\n\'I know best what my own life is worth,\' said Alan; \'and I do not value\r\nit in comparison to the business which requires my instant attention.\'\r\n\r\nReceiving still no satisfactory answer from Mr. Ambrose, Fairford\r\nthought it best to state his resolution to the ladies themselves, in\r\nthe most measured, respectful, and grateful terms; but still such as\r\nexpressed a firm determination to depart on the morrow, or next day\r\nat farthest. After some attempts to induce him to stay, on the alleged\r\nscore of health, which were so expressed that he was convinced they were\r\nonly used to delay his departure, Fairford plainly told them that he was\r\nentrusted with dispatches of consequence to the gentleman known by the\r\nname of Herries, Redgauntlet, and the Laird of the Lochs; and that it\r\nwas matter of life and death to deliver them early.\r\n\r\n\'I dare say, Sister Angelica,\' said the elder Miss Arthuret, that the\r\ngentleman is honest; and if he is really a relation of Father Fairford,\r\nwe can run no risk.\'\r\n\r\n\'Jesu Maria!\' exclaimed the younger. \'Oh, fie, Sister Seraphina! Fie,\r\nfie!--\'VADE RETRO--get thee behind me!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, well; but, sister--Sister Angelica--let me speak with you in the\r\ngallery.\'\r\n\r\nSo out the ladies rustled in their silks and tissues, and it was a good\r\nhalf-hour ere they rustled in again, with importance and awe on their\r\ncountenances.\r\n\r\n\'To tell you the truth, Mr. Fairford, the cause of our desire to delay\r\nyou is--there is a religious gentleman in this house at present\'--\r\n\r\n\'A most excellent person indeed\'--said the sister Angelica.\r\n\r\n\'An anointed of his Master!\' echoed Seraphina,--\'and we should be glad\r\nthat, for conscience\' sake, you would hold some discourse with him\r\nbefore your departure.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oho!\' thought Fairford, \'the murder is out--here is a design of\r\nconversion! I must not affront the good ladies, but I shall soon send\r\noff the priest, I think.\' He then answered aloud, \'that he should be\r\nhappy to converse with any friend of theirs--that in religious matters\r\nhe had the greatest respect for every modification of Christianity,\r\nthough, he must say, his belief was made up to that in which he had\r\nbeen educated; nevertheless, if his seeing the religious person they\r\nrecommended could in the least show his respect\'--\r\n\r\n\'It is not quite that,\' said Sister Seraphina, \'although I am sure the\r\nday is too short to hear him--Father Buonaventure, I mean--speak upon\r\nthe concerns of our souls; but\'--\r\n\r\n\'Come, come, Sister Seraphina,\' said the younger, \'it is needless\r\nto talk so much about it. His--his Eminence--I mean Father\r\nBuonaventure--will himself explain what he wants this gentleman to\r\nknow.\'\r\n\r\n\'His Eminence!\' said Fairford, surprised--\'is this gentleman so high in\r\nthe Catholic Church? The title is given only to Cardinals, I think.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is not a Cardinal as yet,\' answered Seraphina; \'but I assure you,\r\nMr. Fairford, he is as high in rank as he is eminently endowed with good\r\ngifts, and\'--\r\n\r\n\'Come away,\' said Sister Angelica. \'Holy Virgin, how you do talk! What\r\nhas Mr. Fairford to do with Father Buonaventure\'s rank? Only, sir, you\r\nwill remember that the Father has been always accustomed to be treated\r\nwith the most profound deference; indeed\'--\r\n\r\n\'Come away, sister,\' said Sister Seraphina, in her turn; \'who talks now,\r\nI pray you? Mr. Fairford will know how to comport himself.\'\r\n\r\n\'And we had best both leave the room,\' said the younger lady, \'for here\r\nhis Eminence comes.\'\r\n\r\nShe lowered her voice to a whisper as she pronounced the last words; and\r\nas Fairford was about to reply, by assuring her that any friend of hers\r\nshould be treated by him with all the ceremony he could expect, she\r\nimposed silence on him, by holding up her finger.\r\n\r\nA solemn and stately step was now heard in the gallery; it might have\r\nproclaimed the approach not merely of a bishop or cardinal, but of\r\nthe Sovereign Pontiff himself. Nor could the sound have been more\r\nrespectfully listened to by the two ladies, had it announced that the\r\nHead of the Church was approaching in person. They drew themselves,\r\nlike sentinels on duty, one on each side of the door by which the\r\nlong gallery communicated with Fairford\'s apartment, and stood there\r\nimmovable, and with countenances expressive of the deepest reverence.\r\n\r\nThe approach of Father Buonaventure was so slow, that Fairford had time\r\nto notice all this, and to marvel in his mind what wily and ambitious\r\npriest could have contrived to subject his worthy but simple-minded\r\nhostesses to such superstitious trammels. Father Buonaventure\'s entrance\r\nand appearance in some degree accounted for the whole.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of middle life, about forty or upwards; but either care, or\r\nfatigue, or indulgence, had brought on the appearance of premature\r\nold age, and given to his fine features a cast of seriousness or even\r\nsadness. A noble countenance, however, still remained; and though his\r\ncomplexion was altered, and wrinkles stamped upon his brow in many a\r\nmelancholy fold, still the lofty forehead, the full and well-opened eye,\r\nand the well-formed nose, showed how handsome in better days he\r\nmust have been. He was tall, but lost the advantage of his height\r\nby stooping; and the cane which he wore always in his hand, and\r\noccasionally used, as well as his slow though majestic gait, seemed to\r\nintimate that his form and limbs felt already some touch of infirmity.\r\nThe colour of his hair could not be discovered, as, according to the\r\nfashion, he wore a periwig. He was handsomely, though gravely dressed in\r\na secular habit, and had a cockade in his hat; circumstances which did\r\nnot surprise Fairford, who knew that a military disguise was very often\r\nassumed by the seminary priests, whose visits to England, or residence\r\nthere, subjected them to legal penalties.\r\n\r\nAs this stately person entered the apartment, the two ladies facing\r\ninward, like soldiers on their post when about to salute a superior\r\nofficer, dropped on either hand of the father a curtsy so profound that\r\nthe hoop petticoats which performed the feat seemed to sink down to\r\nthe very floor, nay, through it, as if a trap-door had opened for the\r\ndescent of the dames who performed this act of reverence.\r\n\r\nThe father seemed accustomed to such homage, profound as it was; he\r\nturned his person a little way first towards one sister, and then\r\ntowards the other, while, with a gracious inclination of his person,\r\nwhich certainly did not amount to a bow, he acknowledged their curtsy.\r\nBut he passed forward without addressing them, and seemed by doing so to\r\nintimate that their presence in the apartment was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThey accordingly glided out of the room, retreating backwards, with\r\nhands clasped and eyes cast upwards, as if imploring blessings on the\r\nreligious man whom they venerated so highly. The door of the apartment\r\nwas shut after them, but not before Fairford had perceived that there\r\nwere one or two men in the gallery, and that, contrary to what he had\r\nbefore observed, the door, though shut, was not locked on the outside.\r\n\r\n\'Can the good souls apprehend danger from me to this god of their\r\nidolatry?\' thought Fairford. But he had no time to make further\r\nobservations, for the stranger had already reached the middle of his\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nFairford rose to receive him respectfully, but as he fixed his eyes on\r\nthe visitor, he thought that the father avoided his looks. His reasons\r\nfor remaining incognito were cogent enough to account for this, and\r\nFairford hastened to relieve him, by looking downwards in his turn;\r\nbut when again he raised his face, he found the broad light eye of the\r\nstranger so fixed on him that he was almost put out of countenance by\r\nthe steadiness of his gaze. During this time they remained standing.\r\n\r\n\'Take your seat, sir,\' said the father; \'you have been an invalid.\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke with the tone of one who desires an inferior to be seated in\r\nhis presence, and his voice was full and melodious.\r\n\r\nFairford, somewhat surprised to find himself overawed by the airs of\r\nsuperiority, which could be only properly exercised towards one over\r\nwhom religion gave the speaker influence, sat down at his bidding, as\r\nif moved by springs, and was at a loss how to assert the footing of\r\nequality on which he felt that they ought to stand. The stranger kept\r\nthe advantage which he had obtained.\r\n\r\n\'Your name, sir, I am informed, is Fairford?\' said the father.\r\n\r\nAlan answered by a bow.\r\n\r\n\'Called to the Scottish bar,\' continued his visitor, \'There is, I\r\nbelieve, in the West, a family of birth and rank called Fairford of\r\nFairford.\'\r\n\r\nAlan thought this a strange observation from a foreign ecclesiastic,\r\nas his name intimated Father Buonaventure to be; but only answered he\r\nbelieved there was such, a family.\r\n\r\n\'Do you count kindred with them, Mr. Fairford?\' continued the inquirer.\r\n\r\n\'I have not the honour to lay such a claim,\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'My father\'s industry has raised his family from a low and obscure\r\nsituation--I have no hereditary claim to distinction of any kind. May I\r\nask the cause of these inquiries?\'\r\n\r\n\'You will learn it presently,\' said Father Buonaventure, who had given\r\na dry and dissatisfied HEM at the young man\'s acknowledging a plebeian\r\ndescent. He then motioned to him to be silent, and proceeded with his\r\nqueries.\r\n\r\n\'Although not of condition, you are, doubtless, by sentiments and\r\neducation, a man of honour and a gentleman?\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope so, sir,\' said Alan, colouring with displeasure. \'I have not\r\nbeen accustomed to have it questioned.\'\r\n\r\n\'Patience, young man,\' said the unperturbed querist--\'we are on serious\r\nbusiness, and no idle etiquette must prevent its being discussed\r\nseriously. You are probably aware that you speak to a person proscribed\r\nby the severe and unjust laws of the present government?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am aware of the statute 1700, chapter 3,\' said Alan, \'banishing from\r\nthe realm priests and trafficking Papists, and punishing by death, on\r\nsummary conviction, any such person who being so banished may return.\r\nBut I have no means of knowing you, sir, to be one of those persons; and\r\nI think your prudence may recommend to you to keep your own counsel.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is sufficient, sir; and I have no apprehensions of disagreeable\r\nconsequences from your having seen me in this house,\' said the priest.\r\n\r\n\'Assuredly no,\' said Alan. \'I consider myself as indebted for my life to\r\nthe mistresses of Fairladies; and it would be a vile requital on my\r\npart to pry into or make known what I may have seen or heard under\r\nthis hospitable roof. If I were to meet the Pretender himself in such\r\na situation, he should, even at the risk of a little stretch to my\r\nloyalty, be free from any danger from my indiscretion.\'\r\n\r\n\'The Pretender!\' said the priest, with some angry emphasis; but\r\nimmediately softened his tone and added, \'No doubt, however, that\r\nperson is a pretender; and some people think his pretensions are not ill\r\nfounded. But, before running into politics, give me leave to say, that I\r\nam surprised to find a gentleman of your opinions in habits of intimacy\r\nwith Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees and Mr. Redgauntlet, and the medium of\r\nconducting the intercourse betwixt them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pardon me, sir,\' replied Alan Fairford; \'I do not aspire to the honour\r\nof being reputed their confidant or go-between. My concern with those\r\ngentlemen is limited to one matter of business, dearly interesting to\r\nme, because it concerns the safety--perhaps the life--of my dearest\r\nfriend.\'\r\n\r\n\'Would you have any objection to entrust me with the cause of your\r\njourney?\' said Father Buonaventure. \'My advice may be of service to you,\r\nand my influence with one or both these gentlemen is considerable.\'\r\n\r\nFairford hesitated a moment, and, hastily revolving all circumstances,\r\nconcluded that he might perhaps receive some advantage from propitiating\r\nthis personage; while, on the other hand, he endangered nothing by\r\ncommunicating to him the occasion of his journey. He, therefore, after\r\nstating shortly that he hoped Mr. Buonaventure would render him the same\r\nconfidence which he required on his part, gave a short account of Darsie\r\nLatimer--of the mystery which hung over his family--and of the disaster\r\nwhich had befallen him. Finally, of his own resolution to seek for his\r\nfriend, and to deliver him, at the peril of his own life.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic priest, whose manner it seemed to be to avoid all\r\nconversation which did not arise from his own express motion, made\r\nno remarks upon what he had heard, but only asked one or two abrupt\r\nquestions, where Alan\'s narrative appeared less clear to him; then\r\nrising from his seat, he took two turns through the apartment, muttering\r\nbetween his teeth, with emphasis, the word \'madman!\' But apparently he\r\nwas in the habit of keeping all violent emotions under restraint; for he\r\npresently addressed Fairford with the most perfect indifference.\r\n\r\n\'If,\' said he, \'you thought you could do so without breach of\r\nconfidence, I wish you would have the goodness to show me the letter\r\nof Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees. I desire to look particularly at the\r\naddress.\'\r\n\r\nSeeing no cause to decline this extension of his confidence, Alan,\r\nwithout hesitation, put the letter into his hand. Having turned it\r\nround as old Trumbull and Nanty Ewart had formerly done, and, like them,\r\nhaving examined the address with much minuteness, he asked whether he\r\nhad observed these words, pointing to a pencil-writing upon the under\r\nside of the letter. Fairford answered in the negative, and, looking\r\nat the letter, read with surprise, \'CAVE NE LITERAS BELLEROPHONTIS\r\nADFERRES\'; a caution which coincided so exactly with the provost\'s\r\nadmonition, that he would do well to inspect the letter of which he was\r\nbearer, that he was about to spring up and attempt an escape, he knew\r\nnot wherefore, or from whom.\r\n\r\n\'Sit still, young man,\' said the father, with the same tone of authority\r\nwhich reigned in his whole manner, although mingled with stately\r\ncourtesy. \'You are in no danger--my character shall be a pledge for your\r\nsafety. By whom do you suppose these words have been written?\'\r\n\r\nFairford could have answered, \'By Nanty Ewart,\' for he remembered seeing\r\nthat person scribble something with a pencil, although he was not well\r\nenough to observe with accuracy where or upon what. But not knowing\r\nwhat suspicions, or what worse consequences the seamen\'s interest in his\r\naffairs might draw upon him, he judged it best to answer that he knew\r\nnot the hand.\r\n\r\nFather Buonaventure was again silent for a moment or two, which he\r\nemployed in surveying the letter with the strictest attention; then\r\nstepped to the window, as if to examine the address and writing of the\r\nenvelope with the assistance of a stronger light, and Alan Fairford\r\nbeheld him, with no less amazement than high displeasure, coolly and\r\ndeliberately break the seal, open the letter, and peruse the contents.\r\n\r\n\'Stop, sir, hold!\' he exclaimed, so soon as his astonishment permitted\r\nhim to express his resentment in words; \'by what right do you dare\'--\r\n\r\n\'Peace, young gentleman,\' said the father, repelling him with a wave\r\nof his hand; \'be assured I do not act without warrant--nothing can pass\r\nbetwixt Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Redgauntlet that I am not fully entitled to\r\nknow.\'\r\n\r\n\'It may be so,\' said Alan, extremely angry; \'but though you may be these\r\ngentlemen\'s father confessor, you are not mine; and in breaking the seal\r\nof a letter entrusted to my care, you have done me\'--\r\n\r\n\'No injury, I assure you,\' answered the unperturbed priest; \'on the\r\ncontrary, it may be a service.\'\r\n\r\n\'I desire no advantage at such a rate, or to be obtained in such a\r\nmanner,\' answered Fairford; \'restore me the letter instantly, or\'--\r\n\r\n\'As you regard your own safety,\' said the priest, \'forbear all injurious\r\nexpressions, and all menacing gestures. I am not one who can be\r\nthreatened or insulted with impunity; and there are enough within\r\nhearing to chastise any injury or affront offered to me, in case I may\r\nthink it unbecoming to protect or avenge myself with my own hand.\'\r\n\r\nIn saying this, the father assumed an air of such fearlessness and calm\r\nauthority, that the young lawyer, surprised and overawed, forbore, as he\r\nhad intended, to snatch the letter from his hand, and confined himself\r\nto bitter complaints of the impropriety of his conduct, and of the light\r\nin which he himself must be placed to Redgauntlet should he present him\r\na letter with a broken seal.\r\n\r\n\'That,\' said Father Buonaventure, \'shall be fully cared for. I will\r\nmyself write to Redgauntlet, and enclose Maxwell\'s letter, provided\r\nalways you continue to desire to deliver it, after perusing the\r\ncontents.\'\r\n\r\nHe then restored the letter to Fairford, and, observing that he\r\nhesitated to peruse it, said emphatically, \'Read it, for it concerns\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\nThis recommendation, joined to what Provost Crosbie had formerly\r\nrecommended, and to the warning which he doubted not that Nanty intended\r\nto convey by his classical allusion, decided Fairford\'s resolution. \'If\r\nthese correspondents,\' he thought, \'are conspiring against my person,\r\nI have a right to counterplot them; self-preservation, as well as my\r\nfriend\'s safety, require that I should not be too scrupulous.\'\r\n\r\nSo thinking, he read the letter, which was in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\'DEAR RUGGED AND DANGEROUS, \'Will you never cease meriting your old\r\nnick-name? You have springed your dottrel, I find, and what is the\r\nconsequence?--why, that there will be hue and cry after you presently.\r\nThe bearer is a pert young lawyer, who has brought a formal complaint\r\nagainst you, which, luckily, he has preferred in a friendly court.\r\nYet, favourable as the judge was disposed to be, it was with the utmost\r\ndifficulty that cousin Jenny and I could keep him to his tackle. He\r\nbegins to be timid, suspicious, and untractable, and I fear Jenny will\r\nsoon bend her brows on him in vain. I know not what to advise--the\r\nlad who carries this is a good lad--active for his friend--and I have\r\npledged my honour he shall have no personal ill-usage. Pledged my\r\nhonour, remark these words, and remember I can be rugged and dangerous\r\nas well, as my neighbours. But I have not ensured him against a short\r\ncaptivity, and as he is a stirring active fellow, I see no remedy but\r\nkeeping him out of the way till this business of the good Father B----\r\nis safely blown over, which God send it were!--Always thine, even should\r\nI be once more CRAIG-IN-PERIL.\'\r\n\r\n\'What think you, young man, of the danger you have been about to\r\nencounter so willingly?\'\r\n\r\n\'As strangely,\' replied Alan Fairford, \'as of the extraordinary means\r\nwhich you have been at present pleased to use for the discovery of Mr.\r\nMaxwell\'s purpose.\r\n\r\n\'Trouble not yourself to account for my conduct,\' said the father; \'I\r\nhave a warrant for what I do, and fear no responsibility. But tell me\r\nwhat is your present purpose.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should not perhaps name it to you, whose own safety may be\r\nimplicated.\'\r\n\r\n\'I understand you,\' answered the father; \'you would appeal to the\r\nexisting government? That can at no rate be permitted--we will rather\r\ndetain you at Fairladies by compulsion.\'\r\n\r\n\'You will probably,\' said Fairford, \'first weigh the risk of such a\r\nproceeding in a free country.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have incurred more formidable hazard,\' said the priest, smiling; \'yet\r\nI am willing to find a milder expedient. Come; let us bring the matter\r\nto a compromise.\' And he assumed a conciliating graciousness of\r\nmanner, which struck Fairford as being rather too condescending for the\r\noccasion; \'I presume you will be satisfied to remain here in seclusion\r\nfor a day or two longer, provided I pass my solemn word to you that you\r\nshall meet with the person whom you seek after--meet with him in perfect\r\nsafety, and, I trust, in good health, and be afterwards both at liberty\r\nto return to Scotland, or dispose of yourselves as each of you may be\r\nminded?\'\r\n\r\n\'I respect the VERBUM SACERDOTIS as much as can reasonably be expected\r\nfrom a Protestant,\' answered Fairford; \'but methinks, you can scarce\r\nexpect me to repose so much confidence in the word of an unknown person\r\nas is implied in the guarantee which you offer me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not accustomed, sir,\' said the father, in a very haughty tone, \'to\r\nhave my word disputed. But,\' he added, while the angry hue passed from\r\nhis cheek, after a moment\'s reflection, \'you know me not, and ought to\r\nbe excused. I will repose more confidence in your honour than you seem\r\nwilling to rest upon mine; and, since we are so situated that one must\r\nrely upon the other\'s faith, I will cause you to be set presently at\r\nliberty, and furnished with the means of delivering your letter as\r\naddressed, provided that now, knowing the contents, you think it safe\r\nfor yourself to execute the commission.\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford paused. \'I cannot see,\' he at length replied, \'how I can\r\nproceed with respect to the accomplishment of my sole purpose, which is\r\nthe liberation of my friend, without appealing to the law and obtaining\r\nthe assistance of a magistrate. If I present this singular letter of\r\nMr. Maxwell, with the contents of which I have become so unexpectedly\r\nacquainted, I shall only share his captivity.\'\r\n\r\n\'And if you apply to a magistrate, young man, you will bring ruin on\r\nthese hospitable ladies, to whom, in all human probability, you owe your\r\nlife. You cannot obtain a warrant for your purpose, without giving a\r\nclear detail of all the late scenes through which you have passed. A\r\nmagistrate would oblige you to give a complete account of yourself,\r\nbefore arming you with his authority against a third party; and in\r\ngiving such an account, the safety of these ladies will necessarily be\r\ncompromised. A hundred spies have had, and still have, their eyes\r\nupon this mansion; but God will protect his own.\'--He crossed himself\r\ndevoutly, and then proceeded,--\'You can take an hour to think of your\r\nbest plan, and I will pledge myself to forward it thus far, provided\r\nit be not asking you to rely more on my word than your prudence can\r\nwarrant. You shall go to Redgauntlet,--I name him plainly, to show\r\nmy confidence in you,--and you shall deliver him this letter of Mr.\r\nMaxwell\'s, with one from me, in which I will enjoin him to set your\r\nfriend at liberty, or at least to make no attempts upon your own person,\r\neither by detention or otherwise. If you can trust me thus far,\' he\r\nsaid, with a proud emphasis on the words \'I will on my side see you\r\ndepart from this place with the most perfect confidence that you will\r\nnot return armed with powers to drag its inmates to destruction. You\r\nare young and inexperienced--bred to a profession also which sharpens\r\nsuspicion, and gives false views of human nature. I have seen much of\r\nthe world, and have known better than most men how far mutual confidence\r\nis requisite in managing affairs of consequence.\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke with an air of superiority, even of authority, by which\r\nFairford, notwithstanding his own internal struggles, was silenced and\r\noverawed so much, that it was not till the father had turned to leave\r\nthe apartment that he found words to ask him what the consequences would\r\nbe, should he decline to depart on the terms proposed.\r\n\r\n\'You must then, for the safety of all parties, remain for some days\r\nan inhabitant of Fairladies, where we have the means of detaining you,\r\nwhich self-preservation will in that case compel us to make use of. Your\r\ncaptivity will be short; for matters cannot long remain as they are. The\r\ncloud must soon rise, or it must sink upon us for ever. BENEDICITE!\'\r\n\r\nWith these words he left the apartment.\r\n\r\nFairford, upon his departure, felt himself much at a loss what course to\r\npursue. His line of education, as well as his father\'s tenets in matters\r\nof church and state, had taught him a holy horror for Papists, and a\r\ndevout belief in whatever had been said of the Punic faith of Jesuits,\r\nand of the expedients of mental reservation by which the Catholic\r\npriests in general were supposed to evade keeping faith with heretics.\r\nYet there was something of majesty, depressed indeed and overclouded,\r\nbut still grand and imposing, in the manner and words of Father\r\nBuonaventure, which it was difficult to reconcile with those\r\npreconceived opinions which imputed subtlety and fraud to his sect and\r\norder. Above all, Alan was aware that if he accepted not his freedom\r\nupon the terms offered him, he was likely to be detained by force; so\r\nthat, in every point of view, he was a gainer by accepting them.\r\n\r\nA qualm, indeed, came across him, when he considered, as a lawyer, that\r\nthis father was probably, in the eye of law, a traitor; and that there\r\nwas an ugly crime on the Statute Book, called misprision of treason. On\r\nthe other hand, whatever he might think or suspect, he could not take\r\nupon him to say that the man was a priest, whom he had never seen in the\r\ndress of his order, or in the act of celebrating mass; so that he felt\r\nhimself at liberty to doubt of that respecting which he possessed no\r\nlegal proof. He therefore arrived at the conclusion, that he would\r\ndo well to accept his liberty, and proceed to Redgauntlet under the\r\nguarantee of Father Buonaventure, which he scarce doubted would be\r\nsufficient to save him from personal inconvenience. Should he once\r\nobtain speech of that gentleman, he felt the same confidence as\r\nformerly, that he might be able to convince him of the rashness of\r\nhis conduct, should he not consent to liberate Darsie Latimer. At all\r\nevents, he should learn where his friend was, and how circumstanced.\r\n\r\nHaving thus made up his mind, Alan waited anxiously for the expiration\r\nof the hour which had been allowed him for deliberation. He was not kept\r\non the tenter-hooks of impatience an instant longer than the appointed\r\nmoment arrived, for, even as the clock struck, Ambrose appeared at the\r\ndoor of the gallery, and made a sign that Alan should follow him. He did\r\nso, and after passing through some of the intricate avenues common in\r\nold houses, was ushered into a small apartment, commodiously fitted\r\nup, in which he found Father Buonaventure reclining on a couch, in the\r\nattitude of a man exhausted by fatigue or indisposition. On a small\r\ntable beside him, a silver embossed salver sustained a Catholic book of\r\nprayer, a small flask of medicine, a cordial, and a little tea-cup of\r\nold china. Ambrose did not enter the room--he only bowed profoundly, and\r\nclosed the door with the least possible noise, so soon as Fairford had\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\'Sit down, young man,\' said the father, with the same air of\r\ncondescension which had before surprised, and rather offended\r\nFairford. \'You have been ill, and I know too well by my own case that\r\nindisposition requires indulgence. Have you,\' he continued, so soon as\r\nhe saw him seated, \'resolved to remain, or to depart?\'\r\n\r\n\'To depart,\' said Alan, \'under the agreement that you will guarantee my\r\nsafety with the extraordinary person who has conducted himself in such a\r\nlawless manner toward my friend, Darsie Latimer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do not judge hastily, young man,\' replied the father. \'Redgauntlet\r\nhas the claims of a guardian over his ward, in respect to the young\r\ngentleman, and a right to dictate his place of residence, although he\r\nmay have been injudicious in selecting the means by which he thinks to\r\nenforce his authority.\'\r\n\r\n\'His situation as an attainted person abrogates such rights,\' said\r\nFairford, hastily.\r\n\r\n\'Surely,\' replied the priest, smiling at the young lawyer\'s readiness;\r\n\'in the eye of those who acknowledge the justice of the attainder--but\r\nthat do not I. However, sir, here is the guarantee--look at its\r\ncontents, and do not again carry the letters of Uriah.\'\r\n\r\nFairford read these words:--\r\n\r\n\'GOOD FRIEND, \'We send you hither a young man desirous to know the\r\nsituation of your ward, since he came under your paternal authority, and\r\nhopeful of dealing with you for having your relative put at large. This\r\nwe recommend to your prudence, highly disapproving, at the same time, of\r\nany force or coercion when such can be avoided, and wishing, therefore,\r\nthat the bearer\'s negotiation may be successful. At all rates, however,\r\nthe bearer hath our pledged word for his safety and freedom, which,\r\ntherefore, you are to see strictly observed, as you value our honour and\r\nyour own. We further wish to converse with you, with as small loss of\r\ntime as may be, having matters of the utmost confidence to impart.\r\nFor this purpose we desire you to repair hither with all haste, and\r\nthereupon we bid you heartily farewell. P. B.\'\r\n\r\n\'You will understand, sir,\' said the father, when he saw that Alan had\r\nperused his letter, \'that, by accepting charge of this missive, you bind\r\nyourself to try the effect of it before having recourse to any legal\r\nmeans, as you term them, for your friend\'s release.\'\r\n\r\n\'There are a few ciphers added to this letter,\' said Fairford, when he\r\nhad perused the paper attentively,--\'may I inquire what their import\r\nis?\'\r\n\r\n\'They respect my own affairs,\' answered the father, briefly; \'and have\r\nno concern whatever with yours.\'\r\n\r\n\'It seems to me, however,\' replied Alan, \'natural to suppose\'--\r\n\r\n\'Nothing must be supposed incompatible with my honour,\' replied the\r\npriest, interrupting him; \'when such as I am confer favours, we expect\r\nthat they shall be accepted with gratitude, or declined with thankful\r\nrespect--not questioned or discussed.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will accept your letter, then,\' said Fairford, after a minute\'s\r\nconsideration, \'and the thanks you expect shall be most liberally paid,\r\nif the result answer what you teach me to expect.\'\r\n\r\n\'God only commands the issue,\' said Father Buonaventure. \'Man uses\r\nmeans. You understand that, by accepting this commission, you engage\r\nyourself in honour to try the effect of my letter upon Mr. Redgauntlet,\r\nbefore you have recourse to informations or legal warrants?\'\r\n\r\n\'I hold myself bound, as a man of good faith and honour, to do so,\' said\r\nFairford.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I trust you,\' said the father. \'I will now tell you that an\r\nexpress, dispatched by me last night, has, I hear, brought Redgauntlet\r\nto a spot many miles nearer this place, where he will not find it safe\r\nto attempt any violence on your friend, should he be rash enough to\r\nfollow the advice of Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees rather than my commands.\r\nWe now understand each other.\'\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand towards Alan, who was about to pledge his faith in\r\nthe usual form by grasping it with his own, when the father drew\r\nback hastily. Ere Alan had time to comment upon this repulse, a small\r\nside-door, covered with tapestry, was opened; the hangings were\r\ndrawn aside, and a lady, as if by sudden apparition, glided into the\r\napartment. It was neither of the Misses Arthuret, but a woman in the\r\nprime of life, and in the full-blown expansion of female beauty, tall,\r\nfair, and commanding in her aspect. Her locks, of paly gold, were taught\r\nto fall over a brow, which, with the stately glance of the large, open,\r\nblue eyes, might have become Juno herself; her neck and bosom were\r\nadmirably formed, and of a dazzling whiteness. She was rather inclined\r\nto EMBONPOINT, but not more than became her age, of apparently thirty\r\nyears. Her step was that of a queen, but it was of Queen Vashti, not\r\nQueen Esther--the bold and commanding, not the retiring beauty.\r\n\r\nFather Buonaventure raised himself on the couch, angrily, as if\r\ndispleased by this intrusion. \'How now, madam,\' he said, with some\r\nsternness; \'why have we the honour of your company?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because it is my pleasure,\' answered the lady, composedly.\r\n\r\n\'Your pleasure, madam!\' he repeated in the same angry tone.\r\n\r\n\'My pleasure, sir,\' she continued, \'which always keeps exact pace with\r\nmy duty. I had heard you were unwell--let me hope it is only business\r\nwhich produces this seclusion.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am well,\' he replied; \'perfectly well, and I thank you for your\r\ncare--but we are not alone, and this young man\'--\r\n\r\n\'That young man?\' she said, bending her large and serious eye on\r\nAlan Fairford, as if she had been for the first time aware of his\r\npresence,--\'may I ask who he is?\'\r\n\r\n\'Another time, madam; you shall learn his history after he is gone. His\r\npresence renders it impossible for me to explain further.\'\r\n\r\n\'After he is gone may be too late,\' said the lady; \'and what is his\r\npresence to me, when your safety is at stake? He is the heretic lawyer\r\nwhom those silly fools, the Arthurets, admitted into this house at a\r\ntime when they should have let their own father knock at the door in\r\nvain, though the night had been a wild one. You will not surely dismiss\r\nhim?\'\r\n\r\n\'Your own impatience can alone make that step perilous,\' said the\r\nfather; \'I have resolved to take it--do not let your indiscreet\r\nzeal, however excellent its motive, add any unnecessary risk to the\r\ntransaction.\'\r\n\r\n\'Even so?\' said the lady, in a tone of reproach, yet mingled with\r\nrespect and apprehension. \'And thus you will still go forward, like a\r\nstag upon the hunter\'s snares, with undoubting confidence, after all\r\nthat has happened?\'\r\n\r\n\'Peace, madam,\' said Father Buonaventure, rising up; \'be silent, or quit\r\nthe apartment; my designs do not admit of female criticism.\'\r\n\r\nTo this peremptory command the lady seemed about to make a sharp reply;\r\nbut she checked herself, and pressing her lips strongly together, as if\r\nto secure the words from bursting from them which were already formed\r\nupon her tongue, she made a deep reverence, partly as it seemed in\r\nreproach, partly in respect, and left the room as suddenly as she had\r\nentered it.\r\n\r\nThe father looked disturbed at this incident, which he seemed sensible\r\ncould not but fill Fairford\'s imagination with an additional throng of\r\nbewildering suspicions; he bit his lip and muttered something to himself\r\nas he walked through the apartment; then suddenly turned to his visitor\r\nwith a smile of much sweetness, and a countenance in which every rougher\r\nexpression was exchanged for those of courtesy and kindness.\r\n\r\n\'The visit we have been just honoured with, my young friend, has given\r\nyou,\' he said, \'more secrets to keep than I would have wished\r\nyou burdened with. The lady is a person of condition--of rank and\r\nfortune--but nevertheless is so circumstanced that the mere fact of her\r\nbeing known to be in this country would occasion many evils. I should\r\nwish you to observe secrecy on this subject, even to Redgauntlet or\r\nMaxwell, however much I trust them in all that concerns my own affairs.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can have no occasion,\' replied Fairford, \'for holding any discussion\r\nwith these gentlemen, or with any others, on the circumstance which\r\nI have just witnessed--it could only have become the subject of my\r\nconversation by mere accident, and I will now take care to avoid the\r\nsubject entirely.\'\r\n\r\n\'You will do well, sir, and I thank you,\' said the father, throwing much\r\ndignity into the expression of obligation which he meant to convey. \'The\r\ntime may perhaps come when you will learn what it is to have obliged one\r\nof my condition. As to the lady, she has the highest merit, and nothing\r\ncan be said of her justly which would not redound to her praise.\r\nNevertheless--in short, sir, we wander at present as in a morning\r\nmist--the sun will, I trust, soon rise and dispel it, when all that now\r\nseems mysterious will be fully revealed--or it will sink into rain,\'\r\nhe added, in a solemn tone, \'and then explanation will be of little\r\nconsequence.--Adieu, sir; I wish you well.\'\r\n\r\nHe made a graceful obeisance, and vanished through the same side-door by\r\nwhich the lady had entered; and Alan thought he heard their voices high\r\nin dispute in the adjoining apartment.\r\n\r\nPresently afterwards, Ambrose entered, and told him that a horse and\r\nguide waited him beneath the terrace.\r\n\r\n\'The good Father Buonaventure,\' added the butler, \'has been graciously\r\npleased to consider your situation, and desired me to inquire whether\r\nyou have any occasion for a supply of money?\'\r\n\r\n\'Make my respects to his reverence,\' answered Fairford, \'and assure\r\nhim I am provided in that particular. I beg you also to make my\r\nacknowledgements to the Misses Arthuret, and assure them that their kind\r\nhospitality, to which I probably owe my life, shall be remembered with\r\ngratitude as long as that life lasts. You yourself, Mr. Ambrose, must\r\naccept of my kindest thanks for your skill and attention.\'\r\n\r\nMid these acknowledgements they left the house, descended the terrace,\r\nand reached the spot where the gardener, Fairford\'s old acquaintance,\r\nwaited for him, mounted upon one horse and leading another.\r\n\r\nBidding adieu to Ambrose, our young lawyer mounted, and rode down the\r\navenue, often looking back to the melancholy and neglected dwelling\r\nin which he had witnessed such strange scenes, and musing upon the\r\ncharacter of its mysterious inmates, especially the noble and almost\r\nregal-seeming priest, and the beautiful but capricious dame, who, if\r\nshe was really Father Buonaventure\'s penitent, seemed less docile to the\r\nauthority of the church than, as Alan conceived, the Catholic discipline\r\npermitted. He could not indeed help being sensible that the whole\r\ndeportment of these persons differed much from his preconceived notions\r\nof a priest and devotee. Father Buonaventure, in particular, had\r\nmore natural dignify and less art and affectation in his manner, than\r\naccorded with the idea which Calvinists were taught to entertain of that\r\nwily and formidable person, a Jesuitical missionary.\r\n\r\nWhile reflecting on these things, he looked back so frequently at the\r\nhouse, that Dick Gardener, a forward, talkative fellow, who began\r\nto tire of silence, at length said to him, \'I think you will know\r\nFairladies when you see it again, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'I dare say I shall, Richard,\' answered Fairford good-humouredly.\r\n\'I wish I knew as well where I am to go next. But you can tell me,\r\nperhaps?\'\r\n\r\n\'Your worship should know better than I,\' said Dick Gardener;\r\n\'nevertheless, I have a notion you are going where all you Scotsmen\r\nshould be sent, whether you will or no.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not to the devil, I hope, good Dick?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'Why, no. That is a road which you may travel as heretics; but as\r\nScotsmen, I would only send you three-fourths of the way--and that is\r\nback to Scotland again--always craving your honour\'s pardon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Does our journey lie that way?\' said Fairford.\r\n\r\n\'As far as the waterside,\' said Richard. \'I am to carry you to old\r\nFather Crackenthorp\'s, and then you are within a spit and a stride of\r\nScotland, as the saying is. But mayhap you may think twice of going\r\nthither, for all that; for Old England is fat feeding-ground for\r\nnorth-country cattle.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF DARSIE LATIMER\r\n\r\nOur history must now, as the old romancers wont to say, \'leave to\r\ntell\' of the quest of Alan Fairford, and instruct our readers of the\r\nadventures which befell Darsie Latimer, left as he was in the precarious\r\ncustody of his self-named tutor, the Laird of the Lochs of Solway,\r\nto whose arbitrary pleasure he found it necessary for the present to\r\nconform himself.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this prudent resolution, and although he did not\r\nassume such a disguise without some sensations of shame and degradation,\r\nDarsie permitted Cristal Nixon to place over his face, and secure by a\r\nstring, one of those silk masks which ladies frequently wore to preserve\r\ntheir complexions, when exposed to the air during long journeys on\r\nhorseback. He remonstrated somewhat more vehemently against the long\r\nriding-skirt, which converted his person from the waist into the female\r\nguise, but was obliged to concede this point also.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphosis was then complete; for the fair reader must be\r\ninformed, that in those rude times, the ladies, when they honoured the\r\nmasculine dress by assuming any part of it, wore just such hats, coats,\r\nand waistcoats as the male animals themselves made use of, and had no\r\nnotion of the elegant compromise betwixt male and female attire, which\r\nhas now acquired, PAR EXCELLENCE, the name of a HABIT. Trolloping\r\nthings our mothers must have looked, with long square-cut coats, lacking\r\ncollars, and with waistcoats plentifully supplied with a length of\r\npocket, which hung far downwards from the middle. But then they had\r\nsome advantage from the splendid colours, lace, and gay embroidery\r\nwhich masculine attire then exhibited; and, as happens in many similar\r\ninstances, the finery of the materials made amends for the want of\r\nsymmetry and grace of form in the garments themselves. But this is a\r\ndigression.\r\n\r\nIn the court of the old mansion, half manor-place, half farm-house, or\r\nrather a decayed manor-house, converted into an abode for a Cumberland\r\ntenant, stood several saddled horses. Four or five of them were mounted\r\nby servants or inferior retainers, all of whom were well armed with\r\nsword, pistol, and carabine. But two had riding furniture for the use\r\nof females--the one being accoutred with a side-saddle, the other with a\r\npillion attached to the saddle.\r\n\r\nDarsie\'s heart beat quicker within him; he easily comprehended that one\r\nof these was intended for his own use; and his hopes suggested that the\r\nother was designed for that of the fair Green Mantle, whom, according\r\nto his established practice, he had adopted for the queen of his\r\naffections, although his opportunities of holding communication with her\r\nhad not exceeded the length of a silent supper on one occasion, and the\r\ngoing down a country-dance on another. This, however, was no unwonted\r\nmood of passion with Darsie Latimer, upon whom Cupid was used to triumph\r\nonly in the degree of a Mahratta conqueror, who overruns a province with\r\nthe rapidity of lightning, but finds it impossible to retain it beyond\r\na very brief space. Yet this new love was rather more serious than the\r\nscarce skinned-up wounds which his friend Fairford used to ridicule.\r\nThe damsel had shown a sincere interest in his behalf; and the air of\r\nmystery with which that interest was veiled, gave her, to his lively\r\nimagination, the character of a benevolent and protecting spirit, as\r\nmuch as that of a beautiful female.\r\n\r\nAt former times, the romance attending his short-lived attachments\r\nhad been of his own creating, and had disappeared as soon as ever he\r\napproached more closely to the object with which he had invested it.\r\nOn the present occasion, it really flowed from external circumstances,\r\nwhich might have interested less susceptible feelings, and an\r\nimagination less lively than that of Darsie Latimer, young,\r\ninexperienced, and enthusiastic as he was.\r\n\r\nHe watched, therefore, anxiously to whose service the palfrey bearing\r\nthe lady\'s saddle was destined. But ere any female appeared to occupy\r\nit, he was himself summoned to take his seat on the pillion behind\r\nCristal Nixon, amid the grins of his old acquaintance Jan who helped him\r\nto horse, and the unrestrained laughter of Cicely, who displayed on the\r\noccasion a case of teeth which might have rivalled ivory.\r\n\r\nLatimer was at an age when being an object of general ridicule even to\r\nclowns and milkmaids was not a matter of indifference, and he longed\r\nheartily to have laid his horse-whip across Jan\'s shoulders. That,\r\nhowever, was a solacement of his feelings which was not at the moment to\r\nbe thought of; and Cristal Nixon presently put an end to his unpleasant\r\nsituation, by ordering the riders to go on. He himself kept the centre\r\nof the troop, two men riding before and two behind him, always, as it\r\nseemed to Darsie, having their eye upon him, to prevent any attempt to\r\nescape. He could see from time to time, when the straight line of the\r\nroad, or the advantage of an ascent permitted him, that another troop\r\nof three or four riders followed them at about a quarter of a mile\'s\r\ndistance, amongst whom he could discover the tall form of Redgauntlet,\r\nand the powerful action of his gallant black horse. He had little\r\ndoubt that Green Mantle made one of the party, though he was unable to\r\ndistinguish her from the others.\r\n\r\nIn this manner they travelled from six in the morning until nearly ten\r\nof the clock, without Darsie exchanging a word with any one; for he\r\nloathed the very idea of entering into conversation with Cristal Nixon,\r\nagainst whom he seemed to feel an instinctive aversion; nor was that\r\ndomestic\'s saturnine and sullen disposition such as to have encouraged\r\nadvances, had he thought of making them.\r\n\r\nAt length the party halted for the purpose of refreshment; but as they\r\nhad hitherto avoided all villages and inhabited places upon their route,\r\nso they now stopped at one of those large ruinous Dutch barns, which\r\nare sometimes found in the fields, at a distance from the farm-houses to\r\nwhich they belong. Yet in this desolate place some preparations had been\r\nmade for their reception. There were in the end of the barn racks filled\r\nwith provender for the horses, and plenty of provisions for the party\r\nwere drawn from the trusses of straw, under which the baskets that\r\ncontained them had been deposited. The choicest of these were selected\r\nand arranged apart by Cristal Nixon, while the men of the party threw\r\nthemselves upon the rest, which he abandoned to their discretion. In a\r\nfew minutes afterwards the rearward party arrived and dismounted, and\r\nRedgauntlet himself entered the barn with the green-mantled maiden by\r\nhis side. He presented her to Darsie with these words:--\r\n\r\n\'It is time you two should know each other better. I promised you my\r\nconfidence, Darsie, and the time is come for reposing it. But first we\r\nwill have our breakfast; and then, when once more in the saddle, I will\r\ntell you that which it is necessary that you should know. Salute Lilias,\r\nDarsie.\'\r\n\r\nThe command was sudden, and surprised Latimer, whose confusion was\r\nincreased by the perfect ease and frankness with which Lilias offered at\r\nonce her cheek and her hand, and pressing his as she rather took it than\r\ngave her own, said very frankly, \'Dearest Darsie, how rejoiced I am that\r\nour uncle has at last permitted us to become acquainted!\'\r\n\r\nDarsie\'s head turned round; and it was perhaps well that Redgauntlet\r\ncalled on him to sit down, as even that movement served to hide his\r\nconfusion. There is an old song which says--\r\n\r\n  --when ladies are willing,\r\n  A man can but look like a fool;\r\n\r\nAnd on the same principle Darsie Latimer\'s looks at this unexpected\r\nfrankness of reception, would have formed an admirable vignette for\r\nillustrating the passage. \'Dearest Darsie,\' and such a ready, nay, eager\r\nsalute of lip and hand! It was all very gracious, no doubt--and ought to\r\nhave been received with much gratitude; but, constituted as our friend\'s\r\ntemper was, nothing could be more inconsistent with his tone of feeling.\r\nIf a hermit had proposed to him to club for a pot of beer, the illusion\r\nof his reverend sanctity could not have been dispelled more effectually\r\nthan the divine qualities of Green Mantle faded upon the ill-imagined\r\nfrank-heartedness of poor Lilias. Vexed with her forwardness, and\r\naffronted at having once more cheated himself, Darsie could hardly help\r\nmuttering two lines of the song we have already quoted:\r\n\r\n  The fruit that must fall without shaking\r\n  Is rather too mellow for me.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was pity for her too--she was a very pretty young woman--his\r\nfancy had scarcely overrated her in that respect--and the slight\r\nderangement of the beautiful brown locks which escaped in natural\r\nringlets from under her riding-hat, with the bloom which exercise had\r\nbrought into her cheek, made her even more than usually fascinating.\r\nRedgauntlet modified the sternness of his look when it was turned\r\ntowards her, and in addressing her, used a softer tone than his usual\r\ndeep bass. Even the grim features of Cristal Nixon relaxed when he\r\nattended on her, and it was then, if ever, that his misanthropical\r\nvisage expressed some sympathy with the rest of humanity.\r\n\r\n\'How can she,\' thought Latimer, \'look so like an angel, yet be so mere\r\na mortal after all? How could so much seeming modesty have so much\r\nforwardness of manner, when she ought to have been most reserved? How\r\ncan her conduct be reconciled to the grace and ease of her general\r\ndeportment?\'\r\n\r\nThe confusion of thoughts which occupied Darsie\'s imagination, gave to\r\nhis looks a disordered appearance, and his inattention to the food which\r\nwas placed before him, together with his silence and absence of mind,\r\ninduced Lilias solicitously to inquire, whether he did not feel some\r\nreturn of the disorder under which he had suffered so lately. This led\r\nMr. Redgauntlet, who seemed also lost in his own contemplations, to\r\nraise his eyes, and join in the same inquiry with some appearance of\r\ninterest. Latimer explained to both that he was perfectly well.\r\n\r\n\'It is well it is so,\' answered Redgauntlet; \'for we have that before\r\nus which will brook no delay from indisposition--we have not, as Hotspur\r\nsays, leisure to be sick.\'\r\n\r\nLilias, on her part, endeavoured to prevail upon Darsie to partake of\r\nthe food which she offered him, with a kindly and affectionate courtesy\r\ncorresponding to the warmth of the interest she had displayed at their\r\nmeeting; but so very natural, innocent, and pure in its character, that\r\nit would have been impossible for the vainest coxcomb to have mistaken\r\nit for coquetry, or a desire of captivating a prize so valuable as\r\nhis affection. Darsie, with no more than the reasonable share of\r\nself-opinion common to most youths when they approach twenty-one, knew\r\nnot how to explain her conduct.\r\n\r\nSometimes he was tempted to think that his own merits had, even during\r\nthe short intervals when they had seen each other, secured such a hold\r\nof the affections of a young person who had probably been bred up in\r\nignorance of the world and its forms that she was unable to conceal\r\nher partiality. Sometimes he suspected that she acted by her guardian\'s\r\norder, who, aware that he, Darsie, was entitled to a considerable\r\nfortune, might have taken this bold stroke to bring about a marriage\r\nbetwixt him and so near a relative.\r\n\r\nBut neither of these suppositions was applicable to the character of the\r\nparties. Miss Lilias\'s manners, however soft and natural, displayed in\r\ntheir ease and versatility considerable acquaintance with the habits\r\nof the world, and in the few words she said during the morning repast,\r\nthere were mingled a shrewdness and good sense, which could scarce\r\nbelong to a miss capable of playing the silly part of a love-smitten\r\nmaiden so broadly. As for Redgauntlet, with his stately bearing, his\r\nfatal frown, his eye of threat and of command, it was impossible, Darsie\r\nthought, to suspect him of a scheme having private advantage for its\r\nobject; he could as soon have imagined Cassius picking Caesar\'s pocket,\r\ninstead of drawing his poniard on the dictator.\r\n\r\nWhile he thus mused, unable either to eat, drink, or answer to the\r\ncourtesy of Lilias, she soon ceased to speak to him, and sat silent as\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThey had remained nearly an hour in their halting-place, when\r\nRedgauntlet said aloud, \'Look out, Cristal Nixon. If we hear nothing\r\nfrom Fairladies, we must continue our journey.\'\r\n\r\nCristal went to the door, and presently returned and said to his master,\r\nin a voice as harsh as his features, \'Gilbert Gregson is coming, his\r\nhorse as white with foam as if a fiend had ridden him.\'\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet threw from him the plate on which he had been eating, and\r\nhastened towards the door of the barn, which the courier at that moment\r\nentered; a smart jockey with a black velvet hunting-cap, and a broad\r\nbelt drawn tight round his waist, to which was secured his express-bag.\r\nThe variety of mud with which he was splashed from cap to spur showed\r\nhe had had a rough and rapid ride. He delivered a letter to Mr.\r\nRedgauntlet, with an obeisance, and then retired to the end of the barn,\r\nwhere the other attendants were sitting or lying upon the straw, in\r\norder to get some refreshment.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet broke the letter open with haste, and read it with anxious\r\nand discomposed looks. On a second perusal, his displeasure seemed to\r\nincrease, his brow darkened, and was distinctly marked with the fatal\r\nsign peculiar to his family and house. Darsie had never before observed\r\nhis frown bear such a close resemblance to the shape which tradition\r\nassigned it.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet held out the open letter with one hand, and struck it with\r\nthe forefinger of the other, as, in a suppressed and displeased tone,\r\nhe said to Cristal Nixon, \'Countermanded--ordered northward once\r\nmore! \'Northward, when all our hopes lie to the south--a second Derby\r\ndirection, when we turned our back on glory, and marched in quest of\r\nruin!\'\r\n\r\nCristal Nixon took the letter and ran it over, then returned it to his\r\nmaster with the cold observation, \'A female influence predominates.\'\r\n\r\n\'But it shall predominate no longer,\' said Redgauntlet; \'it shall wane\r\nas ours rises in the horizon. Meanwhile, I will on before--and you,\r\nCristal, will bring the party to the place assigned in the letter.\r\nYou may now permit the young persons to have unreserved communication\r\ntogether; only mark that you watch the young man closely enough to\r\nprevent his escape, if he should be idiot enough to attempt it, but not\r\napproaching so close as to watch their free conversation.\'\r\n\r\n\'I care naught about their conversation,\' said Nixon, surlily.\r\n\r\n\'You hear my commands, Lilias,\' said the laird, turning to the young\r\nlady. \'You may use my permission and authority to explain so much of our\r\nfamily matters as you yourself know. At our next meeting I will complete\r\nthe task of disclosure, and I trust I shall restore one Redgauntlet more\r\nto the bosom of our ancient family. Let Latimer, as he calls himself,\r\nhave a horse to himself; he must for some time retain his disguise.--My\r\nhorse--my horse!\'\r\n\r\nIn two minutes they heard him ride off from the door of the barn,\r\nfollowed at speed by two of the armed men of his party.\r\n\r\nThe commands of Cristal Nixon, in the meanwhile, put all the remainder\r\nof the party in motion, but the laird himself was long out of sight ere\r\nthey were in readiness to resume their journey. When at length they set\r\nout, Darsie was accommodated with a horse and side-saddle, instead of\r\nbeing obliged to resume his place on the pillion behind the detestable\r\nNixon. He was obliged, however, to retain his riding-skirt, and to\r\nreassume his mask. Yet, notwithstanding this disagreeable circumstance,\r\nand although he observed that they gave him the heaviest and slowest\r\nhorse of the party, and that, as a further precaution against escape, he\r\nwas closely watched on every side, yet riding in company with the pretty\r\nLilias was an advantage which overbalanced these inconveniences.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this society, to which that very morning he would\r\nhave looked forward as a glimpse of heaven, had, now that it was\r\nthus unexpectedly indulged, something much less rapturous than he had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that, in order to avail himself of a situation so\r\nfavourable for indulging his romantic disposition, he endeavoured to\r\ncoax back, if I may so express myself, that delightful dream of ardent\r\nand tender passion; he felt only such a confusion of ideas at the\r\ndifference between the being whom he had imagined, and her with whom he\r\nwas now in contact, that it seemed to him like the effect of witchcraft.\r\nWhat most surprised him was, that this sudden flame should have died\r\naway so rapidly, notwithstanding that the maiden\'s personal beauty was\r\neven greater than he had expected--her demeanour, unless it should be\r\ndeemed over kind towards himself, as graceful and becoming as he could\r\nhave fancied if, even in his gayest dreams. It were judging hardly\r\nof him to suppose that the mere belief of his having attracted\r\nher affections more easily than he expected was the cause of his\r\nungratefully undervaluing a prize too lightly won, or that his transient\r\npassion played around his heart with the hitting radiance of a wintry\r\nsunbeam flashing against an icicle, which may brighten it for a moment,\r\nbut cannot melt it. Neither of these was precisely the ease, though such\r\nfickleness of disposition might also have some influence in the change.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, perhaps, the lover\'s pleasure, like that of the hunter, is\r\nin the chase; and that the brightest beauty loses half its merit, as\r\nthe fairest flower its perfume, when the willing hand can reach it\r\ntoo easily. There must be doubt--there must be danger--there must be\r\ndifficulty; and if, as the poet says, the course of ardent affection\r\nnever does run smooth, it is perhaps because, without some intervening\r\nobstacle, that which is called the romantic passion of love, in its high\r\npoetical character and colouring can hardly have an existence--any more\r\nthan there can be a current in a river without the stream being narrowed\r\nby steep banks, or checked by opposing rocks.\r\n\r\nLet not those, however, who enter into a union for life without those\r\nembarrassments which delight a Darsie Latimer, or a Lydia Languish, and\r\nwhich are perhaps necessary to excite an enthusiastic passion in breasts\r\nmore firm than theirs, augur worse of their future happiness because\r\ntheir own alliance is formed under calmer auspices. Mutual esteem, an\r\nintimate knowledge of each other\'s character, seen, as in their case,\r\nundisguised by the mists of too partial passion--a suitable proportion\r\nof parties in rank and fortune, in taste and pursuits--are more\r\nfrequently found in a marriage of reason, than in a union of romantic\r\nattachment; where the imagination, which probably created the virtues\r\nand accomplishments with which it invested the beloved object, is\r\nfrequently afterwards employed in magnifying the mortifying consequences\r\nof its own delusion, and exasperating all the stings of disappointment.\r\nThose who follow the banners of Reason are like the well-disciplined\r\nbattalion, which, wearing a more sober uniform and making a less\r\ndazzling show than the light troops commanded by imagination, enjoy more\r\nsafety, and even more honour, in the conflicts of human life. All this,\r\nhowever, is foreign to our present purpose.\r\n\r\nUncertain in what manner to address her whom he had been lately so\r\nanxious to meet with, and embarrassed by a TETE-A-TETE to which his own\r\ntimid inexperience, gave some awkwardness, the party had proceeded more\r\nthan a hundred yards before Darsie assumed courage to accost, or even\r\nto look at, his companion. Sensible, however, of the impropriety of his\r\nsilence, he turned to speak to her; and observing that, although she\r\nwore her mask, there was something like disappointment and dejection\r\nin her manner, he was moved by self-reproach for his own coldness, and\r\nhastened to address her in the kindest tone he could assume.\r\n\r\n\'You must think me cruelly deficient in gratitude, Miss Lilias, that\r\nI have been thus long in your company, without thanking you for the\r\ninterest which you have deigned to take in my unfortunate affairs?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad you have at length spoken,\' she said, \'though I owe it is\r\nmore coldly than I expected. MISS Lilias! DEIGN to take interest! In\r\nwhom, dear Darsie, CAN I take interest but in you; and why do you put\r\nthis barrier of ceremony betwixt us, whom adverse circumstances have\r\nalready separated for such a length of time?\'\r\n\r\nDarsie was again confounded at the extra candour, if we may use the\r\nterm, of this frank avowal. \'One must love partridge very well,\' thought\r\nhe, \'to accept it when thrown in one\'s face--if this is not plain\r\nspeaking, there is no such place as downright Dunstable in being!\'\r\n\r\nEmbarrassed with these reflections, and himself of a nature fancifully,\r\nalmost fastidiously, delicate, he could only in reply stammer forth an\r\nacknowledgement of his companion\'s goodness, and his own gratitude. She\r\nanswered in a tone partly sorrowful and partly impatient, repeating,\r\nwith displeased emphasis, the only distinct words he had been able\r\nto bring forth--\'Goodness--gratitude!--O Darsie! should these be the\r\nphrases between you and me? Alas! I am too sure you are displeased with\r\nme, though I cannot even guess on what account. Perhaps you think I\r\nhave been too free in venturing upon my visit to your friend. But then\r\nremember, it was in your behalf, and that I knew no better way to put\r\nyou on your guard against the misfortunes and restraint which you have\r\nbeen subjected to, and are still enduring.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear Lady\'--said Darsie, rallying his recollection, and suspicious\r\nof some error in apprehension,--a suspicion which his mode of address\r\nseemed at once to communicate to Lilias, for she interrupted him,--\r\n\r\n\'LADY! dear LADY! For whom, or for what, in Heaven\'s name, do you take\r\nme, that you address me so formally?\'\r\n\r\nHad the question been asked in that enchanted hall in fairyland, where\r\nall interrogations must be answered with absolute sincerity, Darsie\r\nhad certainly replied, that he took her for the most frank-hearted and\r\nultra-liberal lass that had ever lived since Mother Eve eat the pippin\r\nwithout paring. But as he was still on middle-earth, and free to avail\r\nhimself of a little polite deceit, he barely answered that he believed\r\nhe had the honour of speaking to the niece of Mr. Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\n\'Surely,\' she replied; \'but were it not as easy for you to have said, to\r\nyour own only sister?\'\r\n\r\nDarsie started in his saddle, as if he had received a pistol-shot.\r\n\r\n\'My sister!\' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'And you did NOT know it, then?\' said she. \'I thought your reception of\r\nme was cold and indifferent!\'\r\n\r\nA kind and cordial embrace took place betwixt the relatives; and so\r\nlight was Darsie\'s spirit, that he really felt himself more relieved, by\r\ngetting quit of the embarrassments of the last half-hour, during which\r\nhe conceived himself in danger of being persecuted by the attachment of\r\na forward girl, than disappointed by the vanishing of so many day-dreams\r\nas he had been in the habit of encouraging during the time when the\r\ngreen-mantled maiden was goddess of his idolatry. He had been already\r\nflung from his romantic Pegasus, and was too happy at length to find\r\nhimself with bones unbroken, though with his back on the ground. He was,\r\nbesides, with all his whims and follies, a generous, kind-hearted youth,\r\nand was delighted to acknowledge so beautiful and amiable a relative,\r\nand to assure her in the warmest terms of his immediate affection and\r\nfuture protection, so soon as they should be extricated from their\r\npresent situation. Smiles and tears mingled on Lilias\'s cheeks, like\r\nshowers and sunshine in April weather.\r\n\r\n\'Out on me,\' she said, \'that I should be so childish as to cry at what\r\nmakes me so sincerely happy! since, God knows, family-love is what my\r\nheart has most longed after, and to which it has been most a stranger.\r\nMy uncle says that you and I, Darsie, are but half Redgauntlets, and\r\nthat the metal of which our father\'s family was made, has been softened\r\nto effeminacy in our mother\'s offspring.\'\r\n\r\n\'Alas!\' said Darsie, \'I know so little of our family story, that I\r\nalmost doubted that I belonged to the House of Redgauntlet, although the\r\nchief of the family himself intimated so much to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'The chief of the family!\' said Lilias. \'You must know little of\r\nyour own descent indeed, if you mean my uncle by that expression. You\r\nyourself, my dear Darsie, are the heir and representative of our ancient\r\nHouse, for our father was the elder brother--that brave and unhappy Sir\r\nHenry Darsie Redgauntlet, who suffered at Carlisle in the year 1746. He\r\ntook the name of Darsie, in conjunction with his own, from our mother,\r\nheiress to a Cumberland family of great wealth and antiquity, of whose\r\nlarge estates you are the undeniable heir, although those of your father\r\nhave been involved in the general doom of forfeiture. But all this must\r\nbe necessarily unknown to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed I hear it for the first time in my life,\' answered Darsie.\r\n\r\n\'And you knew not that I was your sister?\' said Lilias. \'No wonder you\r\nreceived me so coldly. What a strange, wild, forward young person you\r\nmust have thought me--mixing myself in the fortunes of a stranger whom\r\nI had only once spoken to--corresponding with him by signs--Good Heaven!\r\nwhat can you have supposed me?\'\r\n\r\n\'And how should I have come to the knowledge of our connexion?\' said\r\nDarsie. \'You are aware I was not acquainted with it when we danced\r\ntogether at Brokenburn.\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw that with concern, and fain I would have warned you,\' answered\r\nLilias; \'but I was closely watched, and before I could find or make an\r\nopportunity of coming to a full explanation with you on a subject so\r\nagitating, I was forced to leave the room. What I did say was, you may\r\nremember, a caution to leave the southern border, for I foresaw what\r\nhas since happened. But since my uncle has had you in his power, I never\r\ndoubted he had communicated to you our whole family history.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has left me to learn it from you, Lilias; and assure yourself that I\r\nwill hear it with more pleasure from your lips than from his. I have no\r\nreason to be pleased with his conduct towards me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of that,\' said Lilias, \'you will judge better when you have heard what\r\nI have to tell you;\' and she began her communication in the following\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF DARSIE LATIMER, CONTINUED\r\n\r\n\'The House of Redgauntlet,\' said the young lady, \'has for centuries been\r\nsupposed to lie under a doom, which has rendered vain their courage,\r\ntheir talents, their ambition, and their wisdom. Often making a figure\r\nin history, they have been ever in the situation of men striving against\r\nboth wind and tide, who distinguish themselves by their desperate\r\nexertions of strength, and their persevering endurance of toil, but\r\nwithout being able to advance themselves upon their course by either\r\nvigour or resolution. They pretend to trace this fatality to a legendary\r\nhistory, which I may tell you at a less busy moment.\'\r\n\r\nDarsie intimated that he had already heard the tragic story of Sir\r\nAlberick Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\n\'I need only say, then,\' proceeded Lilias, \'that our father and uncle\r\nfelt the family doom in its full extent. They were both possessed of\r\nconsiderable property, which was largely increased by our father\'s\r\nmarriage, and were both devoted to the service of the unhappy House\r\nof Stuart; but (as our mother at least supposed) family considerations\r\nmight have withheld her husband from joining openly in the affair of\r\n1745, had not the high influence which the younger brother possessed\r\nover the elder, from his more decided energy of character, hurried him\r\nalong with himself into that undertaking.\r\n\r\n\'When, therefore, the enterprise came to the fatal conclusion which\r\nbereaved our father of his life and consigned his brother to exile, Lady\r\nRedgauntlet fled from the north of England, determined to break off all\r\ncommunication with her late husband\'s family, particularly his brother,\r\nwhom she regarded as having, by their insane political enthusiasm, been\r\nthe means of his untimely death; and determined that you, my brother, an\r\ninfant, and that I, to whom she had just given birth, should be brought\r\nup as adherents of the present dynasty. Perhaps she was too hasty in\r\nthis determination--too timidly anxious to exclude, if possible, from\r\nthe knowledge of the very spot where we existed, a relation so nearly\r\nconnected with us as our father\'s only brother. But you must make\r\nallowance for what she had suffered. See, brother,\' she said, pulling\r\nher glove off, \'these five blood-specks on my arm are a mark by which\r\nmysterious Nature has impressed, on an unborn infant, a record of its\r\nfather\'s violent death and its mother\'s miseries.\' [Several persons\r\nhave brought down to these days the impressions which Nature had thus\r\nrecorded, when they were yet babes unborn. One lady of quality, whose\r\nfather was long under sentence of death previous to the Rebellion, was\r\nmarked on the back of the neck by the sign of a broad axe. Another whose\r\nkinsmen had been slain in battle and died on the scaffold to the number\r\nof seven, bore a child spattered on the right shoulder and down the\r\narm with scarlet drops, as if of blood. Many other instances might be\r\nquoted.]\r\n\r\n\'You were not, then, born when my father suffered?\' said Darsie.\r\n\r\n\'Alas, no!\' she replied; \'nor were you a twelvemonth old. It was no\r\nwonder that my mother, after going through such scenes of agony,\r\nbecame irresistibly anxious for the sake of her children--of her son in\r\nparticular; the more especially as the late Sir Henry, her husband, had,\r\nby a settlement of his affairs, confided the custody of the persons\r\nof her children, as well as the estates which descended to them,\r\nindependently of those which fell under his forfeiture, to his brother\r\nHugh, in whom he placed unlimited confidence.\'\r\n\r\n\'But my mother had no reason to fear the operation of such a deed,\r\nconceived in favour of an attainted man,\' said Darsie.\r\n\r\n\'True,\' replied Lilias; \'but our uncle\'s attainder might have been\r\nreversed, like that of so many other persons, and our mother, who both\r\nfeared and hated him, lived in continual terror that this would be the\r\ncase, and that she should see the author, as she thought him, of her\r\nhusband\'s death come armed with legal powers, and in a capacity to\r\nuse them for the purpose of tearing her children from her protection.\r\nBesides, she feared, even in his incapacitated condition, the\r\nadventurous and pertinacious spirit of her brother-in-law, Hugh\r\nRedgauntlet, and felt assured that he would make some attempt to possess\r\nhimself of the persons of the children. On the other hand, our uncle,\r\nwhose proud disposition might, perhaps, have been soothed by the offer\r\nof her confidence, revolted against the distrustful and suspicious\r\nmanner in which Lady Darsie Redgauntlet acted towards him. She basely\r\nabused, he said, the unhappy circumstances in which he was placed,\r\nin order to deprive him of his natural privilege of protecting and\r\neducating the infants, whom nature and law, and the will of their\r\nfather, had committed to his charge, and he swore solemnly he would\r\nnot submit to such an injury. Report of his threats was made to Lady\r\nRedgauntlet, and tended to increase those fears which proved but too\r\nwell founded. While you and I, children at that time of two or three\r\nyears old, were playing together in a walled orchard, adjacent to our\r\nmother\'s residence which she had fixed somewhere in Devonshire, my uncle\r\nsuddenly scaled the wall with several men, and I was snatched up; and\r\ncarried off to a boat which waited for them. My mother, however, flew to\r\nyour rescue, and as she seized on and held you fast, my uncle could not,\r\nas he has since told me, possess himself of your person, without using\r\nunmanly violence to his brother\'s widow. Of this he was incapable; and,\r\nas people began to assemble upon my mother\'s screaming, he withdrew,\r\nafter darting upon you and her one of those fearful looks, which, it is\r\nsaid, remain with our family, as a fatal bequest of Sir Alberick, our\r\nancestor.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have some recollection of the scuffle which you mention,\' said\r\nDarsie; \'and I think it was my uncle himself (since my uncle he is)\r\nwho recalled the circumstance to my mind on a late occasion. I can now\r\naccount for the guarded seclusion under which my poor mother lived--for\r\nher frequent tears, her starts of hysterical alarm, and her constant and\r\ndeep melancholy. Poor lady! what a lot was hers, and what must have been\r\nher feelings when it approached to a close!\'\r\n\r\n\'It was then that she adopted,\' said Lilias, \'every precaution her\r\ningenuity could suggest, to keep your very existence concealed from the\r\nperson whom she feared--nay, from yourself; for she dreaded, as she\r\nis said often to have expressed herself, that the wildfire blood of\r\nRedgauntlet would urge you to unite your fortunes to those of your\r\nuncle, who was well known still to carry on political intrigues, which\r\nmost other persons had considered as desperate. It was also possible\r\nthat he, as well as others, might get his pardon, as government showed\r\nevery year more lenity towards the remnant of the Jacobites, and then he\r\nmight claim the custody of your person, as your legal guardian. Either\r\nof these events she considered as the direct road to your destruction.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder she had not claimed the protection of Chancery for me,\' said\r\nDarsie; \'or confided me to the care of some powerful friend.\'\r\n\r\n\'She was on indifferent terms with her relations, on account of her\r\nmarriage with our father,\' said Lilias, \'and trusted more to secreting\r\nyou from your uncle\'s attempts, than to any protection which law\r\nmight afford against them. Perhaps she judged unwisely, but surely not\r\nunnaturally, for one rendered irritable by so many misfortunes and so\r\nmany alarms. Samuel Griffiths, an eminent banker, and a worthy clergyman\r\nnow dead were, I believe, the only persons whom she intrusted with the\r\nexecution of her last will; and my uncle believes that she made them\r\nboth swear to observe profound secrecy concerning your birth and\r\npretensions, until you should come to the age of majority, and, in the\r\nmeantime, to breed you up in the most private way possible, and that\r\nwhich was most likely to withdraw you from my uncle\'s observation.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I have no doubt,\' said Darsie, \'that betwixt change of name\r\nand habitation, they might have succeeded perfectly, but for the\r\naccident--lucky or unlucky, I know not which to term it--which brought\r\nme to Brokenburn, and into contact with Mr. Redgauntlet. I see also why\r\nI was warned against England, for in England\'--\r\n\r\n\'In England alone, if I understand rightly,\' said Miss Redgauntlet,\r\n\'the claims of your uncle to the custody of your person could have\r\nbeen enforced, in case of his being replaced in the ordinary rights of\r\ncitizenship, either by the lenity of the government or by some change\r\nin it. In Scotland, where you possess no property, I understand his\r\nauthority might; have been resisted, and measures taken to put you under\r\nthe protection of the law. But, pray, think it not unlucky that you\r\nhave taken the step of visiting Brokenburn--I feel confident that the\r\nconsequences must be ultimately fortunate, for have they not already\r\nbrought us into contact with each other?\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, she held out her hand to her brother, who grasped it with a\r\nfondness of pressure very different from the manner in which they first\r\nclasped hands that morning. There was a moment\'s pause, while the hearts\r\nof both were overflowing with a feeling of natural affection, to which\r\ncircumstances had hitherto rendered them strangers.\r\n\r\nAt length Darsie broke silence; \'I am ashamed,\' he said, \'my dearest\r\nLilias, that I have suffered you to talk so long about matters\r\nconcerning myself only, while I remain ignorant of your story, and your\r\npresent situation.\'\r\n\r\n\'The former is none of the most interesting, nor the latter the most\r\nsafe or agreeable,\' answered Lilias; \'but now, my dearest brother, I\r\nshall have the inestimable support of your countenance and affection;\r\nand were I but sure that we could weather the formidable crisis which\r\nI find so close at hand, I should have little apprehensions for the\r\nfuture.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me know,\' said Darsie, \'what our present situation is; and rely\r\nupon my utmost exertions both in your defence and my own. For what\r\nreason can my uncle desire to detain me a prisoner? If in mere\r\nopposition to the will of my mother, she has long been no more; and I\r\nsee not why he should wish, at so much trouble and risk, to interfere\r\nwith the free will of one, to whom a few months will give a privilege\r\nof acting for himself, with which he will have no longer any pretence to\r\ninterfere.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dearest Arthur,\' answered Lilias--\'for that name, as well as\r\nDarsie, properly belongs to you--it is the leading feature in my uncle\'s\r\ncharacter, that he has applied every energy of his powerful mind to the\r\nservice of the exiled family of Stuart. The death of his brother, the\r\ndilapidation of his own fortunes, have only added to his hereditary zeal\r\nfor the House of Stuart a deep and almost personal hatred against the\r\npresent reigning family. He is, in short, a political enthusiast of\r\nthe most dangerous character, and proceeds in his agency with as much\r\nconfidence, as if he felt himself the very Atlas who is alone capable of\r\nsupporting a sinking cause.\'\r\n\r\n\'And where or how did you, my Lilias, educated, doubtless, under his\r\nauspices, learn to have a different view of such subjects?\'\r\n\r\n\'By a singular chance,\' replied Lilias, \'in the nunnery where my uncle\r\nplaced me. Although the abbess was a person exactly after his own heart,\r\nmy education as a pensioner devolved much on an excellent old mother who\r\nhad adopted the tenets of the Jansenists, with perhaps a still further\r\ntendency towards the reformed doctrines, than those of Port Royal. The\r\nmysterious secrecy with which she inculcated these tenets, gave them\r\ncharms to my young mind, and I embraced them the rather that they were\r\nin direct opposition to the doctrines of the abbess, whom I hated so\r\nmuch for her severity, that I felt a childish delight in setting her\r\ncontrol at defiance, and contradicting in my secret soul all that I was\r\nopenly obliged to listen to with reverence. Freedom of religious opinion\r\nbrings on, I suppose, freedom of political creed; for I had no sooner\r\nrenounced the Pope\'s infallibility, than I began to question the\r\ndoctrine of hereditary and indefeasible right. In short, strange as it\r\nmay seem, I came out of a Parisian convent, not indeed an instructed\r\nWhig and Protestant, but with as much inclination to be so as if I had\r\nbeen bred up, like you, within the Presbyterian sound of Saint Giles\'s\r\nchimes.\'\r\n\r\n\'More so, perhaps,\' replied Darsie; \'for the nearer the church--the\r\nproverb is somewhat musty. But how did these liberal opinions of yours\r\nagree with the very opposite prejudices of my uncle?\'\r\n\r\n\'They would have agreed like fire and water,\' answered Lilias, \'had I\r\nsuffered mine to become visible; but as that would have subjected me to\r\nconstant reproach and upbraiding, or worse, I took great care to keep my\r\nown secret; so that occasional censures for coldness, and lack of zeal\r\nfor the good cause, were the worst I had to undergo; and these were bad\r\nenough.\'\r\n\r\n\'I applaud your caution,\' said Darsie.\r\n\r\n\'You have reason,\' replied his sister; \'but I got so terrible a specimen\r\nof my uncle\'s determination of character, before I had been acquainted\r\nwith him for much more than a week, that it taught me at what risk I\r\nshould contradict his humour. I will tell you the circumstances; for it\r\nwill better teach you to appreciate the romantic and resolved nature\r\nof his character, than anything which I could state of his rashness and\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\'After I had been many a long year at the convent, I was removed from\r\nthence, and placed with a meagre old Scottish lady of high rank, the\r\ndaughter of an unfortunate person whose head had in the year 1715 been\r\nplaced on Temple Bar. She subsisted on a small pension from the French\r\nCourt, aided by an occasional gratuity from the Stuarts; to which the\r\nannuity paid for my board formed a desirable addition. She was not\r\nill-tempered, nor very covetous--neither beat me nor starved me--but she\r\nwas so completely trammelled by rank and prejudices, so awfully profound\r\nin genealogy, and so bitterly keen, poor lady, in British, politics,\r\nthat I sometimes thought it pity that the Hanoverians, who murdered, as\r\nshe used to tell me, her poor dear father, had left his dear daughter in\r\nthe land of the living. Delighted, therefore, was I, when my uncle made\r\nhis appearance, and abruptly announced his purpose of conveying me\r\nto England. My extravagant joy at the idea of leaving Lady Rachel\r\nRougedragon was somewhat qualified by observing the melancholy look,\r\nlofty demeanour, and commanding tone of my near relative. He held more\r\ncommunication with me on the journey, however, than consisted with his\r\ntaciturn demeanour in general, and seemed anxious to ascertain my tone\r\nof character, and particularly in point of courage. Now, though I am\r\na tamed Redgauntlet, yet I have still so much of our family spirit as\r\nenables me to be as composed in danger as most of my sex; and upon two\r\noccasions in the course of our journey--a threatened attack by banditti,\r\nand the overturn of our carriage--I had the fortune so to conduct\r\nmyself, as to convey to my uncle a very favourable idea of my\r\nintrepidity. Probably this encouraged him to put in execution the\r\nsingular scheme which he had in agitation.\r\n\r\n\'Ere we reached London we changed our means of conveyance, and altered\r\nthe route by which we approached the city, more than once; then, like a\r\nhare which doubles repeatedly at some distance from the seat she means\r\nto occupy, and at last leaps into her form from a distance so great as\r\nshe can clear by a spring, we made a forced march, and landed in private\r\nand obscure lodgings in a little old street in Westminster, not far from\r\nthe Cloisters.\r\n\r\n\'On the morning of the day on which we arrived my uncle went abroad, and\r\ndid not return for some hours. Meantime I had no other amusement than to\r\nlisten to the tumult of noises which succeeded each other, or reigned\r\nin confusion together during the whole morning. Paris I had thought\r\nthe most noisy capital in the world, but Paris seemed midnight silence\r\ncompared to London. Cannon thundered near and at a distance--drums,\r\ntrumpets, and military music of every kind, rolled, flourished, and\r\npierced the clouds, almost without intermission. To fill up the concert,\r\nbells pealed incessantly from a hundred steeples. The acclamations of\r\nan immense multitude were heard from time to time, like the roaring of a\r\nmighty ocean, and all this without my being able to glean the least idea\r\nof what was going on, for the windows of our apartment looked upon\r\na waste backyard, which seemed totally deserted. My curiosity became\r\nextreme, for I was satisfied, at length, that it must be some festival\r\nof the highest order which called forth these incessant sounds.\r\n\r\n\'My uncle at length returned, and with him a man of an exterior\r\nsingularly unprepossessing. I need not describe him to you, for--do not\r\nlook round--he rides behind us at this moment.\'\r\n\r\n\'That respectable person, Mr. Cristal Nixon, I suppose?\' said Darsie.\r\n\r\n\'The same,\' answered Lilias; \'make no gesture, that may intimate we are\r\nspeaking of him.\'\r\n\r\nDarsie signified that he understood her, and she pursued her relation.\r\n\r\n\'They were both in full dress, and my uncle, taking a bundle from Nixon,\r\nsaid to me, "Lilias, I am come to carry you to see a grand ceremony--put\r\non as hastily as you can the dress you will find in that parcel, and\r\nprepare to attend me." I found a female dress, splendid and elegant,\r\nbut somewhat bordering upon the antique fashion. It might be that of\r\nEngland, I thought, and I went to my apartment full of curiosity, and\r\ndressed myself with all speed.\r\n\r\n\'My uncle surveyed me with attention--"She may pass for one of the\r\nflower-girls," he said to Nixon, who only answered with a nod.\r\n\r\n\'We left the house together, and such was their knowledge of the lanes,\r\ncourts, and bypaths, that though there was the roar of a multitude in\r\nthe broad streets, those which we traversed were silent and deserted;\r\nand the strollers whom we met, tired of gazing upon gayer figures,\r\nscarcely honoured us with a passing look, although, at any other time,\r\nwe should, among these vulgar suburbs, have attracted a troublesome\r\nshare of observation. We crossed at length a broad street, where many\r\nsoldiers were on guard, while others, exhausted with previous duty, were\r\neating, drinking, smoking, and sleeping beside their piled arms.\r\n\r\n\'"One day, Nixon," whispered my uncle, "we will make these redcoated\r\ngentry stand to their muskets more watchfully."\r\n\r\n\'"Or it will be the worse for them," answered his attendant, in a voice\r\nas unpleasant as his physiognomy.\r\n\r\n\'Unquestioned and unchallenged by any one, we crossed among the guards;\r\nand Nixon tapped thrice at a small postern door in a huge ancient\r\nbuilding, which was straight before us. It opened, and we entered\r\nwithout my perceiving by whom we were admitted. A few dark and narrow\r\npassages at length conveyed us into an immense Gothic hall, the\r\nmagnificence of which baffles my powers of description.\r\n\r\n\'It was illuminated by ten thousand wax lights, whose splendour at first\r\ndazzled my eyes, coming as we did from these dark and secret avenues.\r\nBut when my sight began to become steady, how shall I describe what\r\nI beheld? Beneath were huge ranges of tables, occupied by princes and\r\nnobles in their robes of state--high officers of the crown, wearing\r\ntheir dresses and badges of authority--reverend prelates and judges, the\r\nsages of the church and law, in their more sombre, yet not less awful\r\nrobes--with others whose antique and striking costume announced their\r\nimportance, though I could not even guess who they might be. But at\r\nlength the truth burst on me at once--it was, and the murmurs around\r\nconfirmed it, the Coronation Feast. At a table above the rest, and\r\nextending across the upper end of the hall, sat enthroned the youthful\r\nsovereign himself, surrounded by the princes of the blood, and other\r\ndignitaries, and receiving the suit and homage of his subjects. Heralds\r\nand pursuivants, blazing in their fantastic yet splendid armorial\r\nhabits, and pages of honour, gorgeously arrayed in the garb of other\r\ndays, waited upon the princely banqueters. In the galleries with which\r\nthis spacious hall was surrounded, shone all, and more than all, that\r\nmy poor imagination could conceive, of what was brilliant in riches, or\r\ncaptivating in beauty. Countless rows of ladies, whose diamonds, jewels,\r\nand splendid attire were their least powerful charms, looked down from\r\ntheir lofty seats on the rich scene beneath, themselves forming a show\r\nas dazzling and as beautiful as that of which they were spectators.\r\nUnder these galleries, and behind the banqueting tables, were a\r\nmultitude of gentlemen, dressed as if to attend a court, but whose garb,\r\nalthough rich enough to have adorned a royal drawing room, could not\r\ndistinguish them in such a high scene as this. Amongst these we wandered\r\nfor a few minutes, undistinguished and unregarded. I saw several\r\nyoung persons dressed as I was, so was under no embarrassment from the\r\nsingularity of my habit, and only rejoiced, as I hung on my uncle\'s\r\narm, at the magical splendour of such a scene, and at his goodness for\r\nprocuring me the pleasure of beholding it.\r\n\r\n\'By and by, I perceived that my uncle had acquaintances among those\r\nwho were under the galleries, and seemed, like ourselves, to be mere\r\nspectators of the solemnity. They recognized each other with a single\r\nword, sometimes only with a grip of the hand-exchanged some private\r\nsigns, doubtless--and gradually formed a little group, in the centre of\r\nwhich we were placed.\r\n\r\n\'"Is it not a grand sight, Lilias?" said my uncle. "All the noble, and\r\nall the wise, and all the wealthy of Britain, are there assembled."\r\n\r\n\'"It is indeed," said I, "all that my mind could have fancied of regal\r\npower and splendour."\r\n\r\n\'"Girl," he whispered,--and my uncle can make his whispers as terribly\r\nemphatic as his thundering voice or his blighting look--"all that is\r\nnoble and worthy in this fair land are there assembled--but it is to\r\nbend like slaves and sycophants before the throne of a new usurper."\r\n\r\n\'I looked at him, and the dark hereditary frown of our unhappy ancestor\r\nwas black upon his brow.\r\n\r\n\'"For God\'s sake," I whispered, "consider where we are."\r\n\r\n\'"Fear nothing," he said; "we are surrounded by friends." As he\r\nproceeded, his strong and muscular frame shook with suppressed\r\nagitation. "See," he said, "yonder bends Norfolk, renegade to his\r\nCatholic.faith; there stoops the Bishop of ----, traitor to the Church\r\nof England; and,--shame of shames! yonder the gigantic form of Errol\r\nbows his head before the grandson of his father\'s murderer! But a sign\r\nshall be seen this night amongst them--MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN,\r\nshall be read on these walls, as distinctly as the spectral handwriting\r\nmade them visible on those of Belshazzar!"\r\n\r\n\'"For God\'s sake," said I, dreadfully alarmed, "it is impossible you can\r\nmeditate violence in such a presence!"\r\n\r\n\'"None is intended, fool," he answered, "nor can the slightest mischance\r\nhappen, provided you will rally your boasted courage, and obey my\r\ndirections. But do it coolly and quickly, for there are a hundred lives\r\nat stake."\r\n\r\n\'"Alas! what--can I do?" I asked in the utmost terror.\r\n\r\n\'"Only be prompt to execute my bidding," said he; "it is but to lift a\r\nglove--Here, hold this in your hand--throw the train of your dress over\r\nit, be firm, composed, and ready--or, at all events, I step forward\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n\'"If there is no violence designed," I said, taking, mechanically, the\r\niron glove he put into my hand.\r\n\r\n\'"I could not conceive his meaning; but, in the excited state of mind in\r\nwhich I beheld him, I was convinced that disobedience on my part would\r\nlead to some wild explosion. I felt, from the emergency of the occasion,\r\na sudden presence of mind, and resolved to do anything that might avert\r\nviolence and bloodshed. I was not long held in suspense. A loud flourish\r\nof trumpets and the voice of heralds were mixed with the clatter of\r\nhorses\' hoofs, while a champion, armed at all points like those I had\r\nread of in romances, attended by squires, pages, and the whole\r\nretinue of chivalry, pranced forward, mounted upon a barbed steed. His\r\nchallenge, in defiance of all who dared impeach the title of the new\r\nsovereign, was recited aloud--once, and again."\r\n\r\n\'"Rush in at the third sounding," said my uncle to me; "bring me the\r\nparader\'s gage, and leave mine in lieu of it."\r\n\r\n\'I could not see how this was to be done, as we were surrounded by\r\npeople on all sides. But, at the third sounding of the trumpets, a lane\r\nopened as if by word of command, betwixt me and the champion, and my\r\nuncle\'s voice said, "Now, Lilias, NOW!"\r\n\r\n\'With a swift and yet steady step, and with a presence of mind for\r\nwhich I have never since been able to account, I discharged the perilous\r\ncommission. I was hardly seen, I believe, as I exchanged the pledges of\r\nbattle, and in an instant retired. "Nobly done, my girl!" said my\r\nuncle, at whose side I found myself, shrouded as I was before, by the\r\ninterposition of the bystanders. "Cover our retreat, gentlemen," he\r\nwhispered to those around him.\r\n\r\n\'Room was made for us to approach the wall, which seemed to open, and we\r\nwere again involved in the dark passages through which we had formerly\r\npassed. In a small anteroom, my uncle stopped, and hastily muffling me\r\nin a mantle which was lying there, we passed the guards--threaded the\r\nlabyrinth of empty streets and courts, and reached our retired lodgings\r\nwithout attracting the least attention.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have often heard,\' said Darsie, \'that a female, supposed to be a\r\nman in disguise,--and yet, Lilias, you do not look very masculine,--had\r\ntaken up the champion\'s gauntlet at the present king\'s coronation, and\r\nleft in its place a gage of battle, with a paper, offering to accept the\r\ncombat, provided a fair field should be allowed for it. I have hitherto\r\nconsidered it as an idle tale. I little thought how nearly I was\r\ninterested in the actors of a scene so daring. How could you have\r\ncourage to go through with it?\' [See Note 9.]\r\n\r\n\'Had I had leisure for reflection,\' answered his sister, \'I should have\r\nrefused, from a mixture of principle and of fear. But, like many people\r\nwho do daring actions, I went on because I had not time to think of\r\nretreating. The matter was little known, and it is said the king had\r\ncommanded that it should not be further inquired into;--from prudence,\r\nas I suppose, and lenity, though my uncle chooses to ascribe the\r\nforbearance of the Elector of Hanover, as he calls him, sometimes to\r\npusillanimity, and sometimes to a presumptuous scorn of the faction who\r\nopposes his title.\'\r\n\r\n\'And have your subsequent agencies under this frantic enthusiast,\' said\r\nDarsie, \'equalled this in danger?\'\r\n\r\n\'No--nor in importance,\' replied Lilias; \'though I have witnessed much\r\nof the strange and desperate machinations, by which, in spite of every\r\nobstacle, and in contempt of every danger, he endeavours to awaken the\r\ncourage of a broken party. I have traversed, in his company, all England\r\nand Scotland, and have visited the most extraordinary and contrasted\r\nscenes; now lodging at the castles of the proud gentry of Cheshire and\r\nWales, where the retired aristocrats, with opinions as antiquated as\r\ntheir dwellings and their manners, still continue to nourish Jacobitical\r\nprinciples; and the next week, perhaps, spent among outlawed smugglers,\r\nor Highland banditti. I have known my uncle often act the part of a\r\nhero, and sometimes that of a mere vulgar conspirator, and turn himself,\r\nwith the most surprising flexibility, into all sorts of shapes to\r\nattract proselytes to his cause.\'\r\n\r\n\'Which, in the present day,\' said Darsie, \'he finds, I presume, no easy\r\ntask.\'\r\n\r\n\'So difficult,\' said Lilias, \'that, I believe, he has, at different\r\ntimes, disgusted with the total falling away of some friends, and\r\nthe coldness of others, been almost on the point of resigning his\r\nundertaking. How often I have I known him affect an open brow and a\r\njovial manner, joining in the games of the gentry, and even in the\r\nsports of the common people, in order to invest himself with a temporary\r\ndegree of popularity; while, in fact, his heart was bursting to witness\r\nwhat he called the degeneracy of the times, the decay of activity among\r\nthe aged, and the want of zeal in the rising generation. After the day\r\nhas been spent in the hardest exercise, he has spent the night in pacing\r\nhis solitary chamber, bewailing the downfall of the cause, and wishing\r\nfor the bullet of Dundee or the axe of Balmerino.\'\r\n\r\n\'A strange delusion,\' said Darsie; \'and it is wonderful that it does not\r\nyield to the force of reality.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, but,\' replied Lilias, \'realities of late have seemed to flatter his\r\nhopes. The general dissatisfaction with the peace--the unpopularity\r\nof the minister, which has extended itself even to the person of his\r\nmaster--the various uproars which have disturbed the peace of the\r\nmetropolis, and a general state of disgust and disaffection, which seems\r\nto affect the body of the nation, have given unwonted encouragement to\r\nthe expiring hopes of the Jacobites, and induced many, both at the Court\r\nof Rome, and, if it can be called so, of the Pretender, to lend a more\r\nfavourable ear than they had hitherto done to the insinuations of those\r\nwho, like my uncle, hope, when hope is lost to all but themselves.\r\nNay, I really believe that at this moment they meditate some desperate\r\neffort. My uncle has been doing all in his power, of late, to conciliate\r\nthe affections of those wild communities that dwell on the Solway, over\r\nwhom our family possessed a seignorial interest before the forfeiture,\r\nand amongst whom, on the occasion of 1745, our unhappy father\'s\r\ninterest, with his own, raised a considerable body of men. But they are\r\nno longer willing to obey his summons; and, as one apology among others,\r\nthey allege your absence as their natural head and leader. This has\r\nincreased his desire to obtain possession of your person, and, if he\r\npossibly can, to influence your mind, so as to obtain your authority to\r\nhis proceedings.\'\r\n\r\n\'That he shall never obtain,\' answered Darsie; \'my principles and\r\nmy prudence alike forbid such a step. Besides, it would be totally\r\nunavailing to his purpose. Whatever these people may pretend, to evade\r\nyour uncle\'s importunities, they cannot, at this time of day, think of\r\nsubjecting their necks again to the feudal yoke, which was effectually\r\nbroken by the act of 1748, abolishing vassalage and hereditary\r\njurisdictions.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, but that my uncle considers as the act of a usurping government,\'\r\nsaid Lilias.\r\n\r\n\'Like enough he may think so,\' answered her brother, \'for he is a\r\nsuperior, and loses his authority by, the enactment. But the question\r\nis, what the vassals will think of it who have gained their freedom\r\nfrom feudal slavery, and have now enjoyed that freedom for many years?\r\nHowever, to cut the matter short, if five hundred men would rise at the\r\nwagging of my finger, that finger shall not be raised in a cause which I\r\ndisapprove of, and upon that my uncle may reckon.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you may temporize,\' said Lilias, upon whom the idea of her uncle\'s\r\ndispleasure made evidently a strong impression,--\'you may temporize,\r\nas most of the gentry in this country do, and let the bubble burst of\r\nitself; for it is singular how few of them venture to oppose my uncle\r\ndirectly. I entreat you to avoid direct collision with him. To hear\r\nyou, the head of the House of Redgauntlet, declare against the family\r\nof Stuart, would either break his heart, or drive him to some act of\r\ndesperation.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but, Lilias, you forget that the consequences of such an act of\r\ncomplaisance might be, that the House of Redgauntlet and I might lose\r\nboth our heads at one blow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Alas!\' said she, \'I had forgotten that danger. I have grown familiar\r\nwith perilous intrigues, as the nurses in a pest-house are said to\r\nbecome accustomed to the air around them, till they forget even that it\r\nis noisome.\'\r\n\r\n\'And yet,\' said Darsie, \'if I could free myself from him without coming\r\nto an open rupture. Tell me, Lilias, do you think it possible that he\r\ncan have any immediate attempt in view?\'\r\n\r\n\'To confess the truth,\' answered Lilias, \'I cannot doubt that he has.\r\nThere has been an unusual bustle among the Jacobites of late. They have\r\nhopes, as I told you, from circumstances unconnected with their own\r\nstrength. Just before you came to the country, my uncle\'s desire to find\r\nyou out became, if possible, more eager than ever--he talked of men\r\nto be presently brought together, and of your name and influence for\r\nraising them. At this very time your first visit to Brokenburn took\r\nplace. A suspicion arose in my uncle\'s mind, that you might be the\r\nyouth he sought, and it was strengthened by papers and letters which the\r\nrascal Nixon did not hesitate to take from your pocket. Yet a mistake\r\nmight have occasioned a fatal explosion; and my uncle therefore posted\r\nto Edinburgh to follow out the clue he had obtained, and fished enough\r\nof information from old Mr. Fairford to make him certain that you were\r\nthe person he sought. Meanwhile, and at the expense of some personal\r\nand perhaps too bold exertion, I endeavoured, through your friend young\r\nFairford, to put you on your guard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Without success,\' said Darsie, blushing under his mask when he\r\nrecollected how he had mistaken his sister\'s meaning.\r\n\r\n\'I do not wonder that my warning was fruitless,\' said she; \'the thing\r\nwas doomed to be. Besides, your escape would have been difficult. You\r\nwere dogged the whole time you were at the Shepherd\'s Bush and at Mount\r\nSharon, by a spy who scarcely ever left you.\'\r\n\r\n\'The wretch, little Benjie!\' exclaimed Darsie. \'I will wring the\r\nmonkey\'s neck round, the first time we meet.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was he indeed who gave constant information of your motions to\r\nCristal Nixon,\' said Lilias.\r\n\r\n\'And Cristal Nixon--I owe him, too, a day\'s work in harvest,\' said\r\nDarsie; \'for I am mistaken if he was not the person that struck me down\r\nwhen I was made prisoner among the rioters.\'\r\n\r\n\'Like enough; for he has a head and hand for any villany. My uncle was\r\nvery angry about it; for though the riot was made to have an opportunity\r\nof carrying you off in the confusion, as well as to put the fishermen\r\nat variance with the public law, it would have been his last thought to\r\nhave injured a hair of your head. But Nixon has insinuated himself into\r\nall my uncle\'s secrets, and some of these are so dark and dangerous,\r\nthat though there are few things he would not dare, I doubt if he dare\r\nquarrel with him. And yet I know that of Cristal would move my uncle to\r\npass his sword through his body.\'\r\n\r\n\'What is it, for Heaven\'s sake?\', said Darsie. \'I have a particular\r\ndesire for wishing to know.\'\r\n\r\n\'The old, brutal desperado, whose face and mind are a libel upon human\r\nnature, has had the insolence to speak to his master\'s niece as one whom\r\nhe was at liberty to admire; and when I turned on him with the anger and\r\ncontempt he merited, the wretch grumbled out something, as if he held\r\nthe destiny of our family in his hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thank you, Lilias,\' said Darsie, eagerly,--\'I thank you with all my\r\nheart for this communication. I have blamed myself as a Christian man\r\nfor the indescribable longing I felt from the first moment I saw that\r\nrascal, to send a bullet through his head; and now you have perfectly\r\naccounted for and justified this very laudable wish. I wonder my uncle,\r\nwith the powerful sense you describe him to be possessed of, does not\r\nsee through such a villain.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe he knows him to be capable of much evil,\' answered\r\nLilias--\'selfish, obdurate, brutal, and a man-hater. But then\r\nhe conceives him to possess the qualities most requisite for a\r\nconspirator--undaunted courage, imperturbable coolness and address, and\r\ninviolable fidelity. In the last particular he may be mistaken. I have\r\nheard Nixon blamed for the manner in which our poor father was taken\r\nafter Culloden.\'\r\n\r\n\'Another reason for my innate aversion,\' said Darsie, but I will be on\r\nmy guard with him.\'\r\n\r\n\'See, he observes us closely,\' said Lilias. \'What a thing is conscience!\r\nHe knows we are now speaking of him, though he cannot have heard a word\r\nthat we have said.\'\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if she had guessed truly; for Cristal Nixon at that moment\r\nrode up to them, and said, with an affectation of jocularity, which sat\r\nvery ill on his sullen features, \'Come, young ladies, you have had time\r\nenough for your chat this morning, and your tongues, I think, must\r\nbe tired. We are going to pass a village, and I must beg you to\r\nseparate--you, Miss Lilias, to ride a little behind--and you, Mrs.,\r\nor Miss, or Master, whichever you choose to be called, to be jogging a\r\nlittle before.\'\r\n\r\nLilias checked her horse without speaking, but not until she had given\r\nher brother an expressive look, recommending caution; to which he\r\nreplied by a signal indicating that he understood and would comply with\r\nher request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nNARRATTVE OF DARSIE LATIMER, CONTINUED\r\n\r\nLeft to his solitary meditations, Darsie (for we will still term Sir\r\nArthur Darsie Redgauntlet of that Ilk by the name to which the reader\r\nis habituated) was surprised not only at the alteration of his own state\r\nand condition, but at the equanimity with which he felt himself disposed\r\nto view all these vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nHis fever--fit of love had departed like a morning\'s dream, and left\r\nnothing behind but a painful sense of shame, and a resolution to be more\r\ncautious ere he again indulged in such romantic visions. His station\r\nin society was changed from that of a wandering, unowned youth, in whom\r\nnone appeared to take an interest excepting the strangers by whom he had\r\nbeen educated, to the heir of a noble house, possessed of such influence\r\nand such property, that it seemed as if the progress or arrest of\r\nimportant political events were likely to depend upon his resolution.\r\nEven this sudden elevation, the more than fulfilment of those wishes\r\nwhich had haunted him ever since he was able to form a wish on the\r\nsubject, was contemplated by Darsie, volatile as his disposition was,\r\nwithout more than a few thrills of gratified vanity.\r\n\r\nIt is true, there were circumstances in his present situation to\r\ncounterbalance such high advantages. To be a prisoner in the hands of a\r\nman so determined as his uncle, was no agreeable consideration, when\r\nhe was calculating how he might best dispute his pleasure and refuse\r\nto join him in the perilous enterprise which he seemed to meditate.\r\nOutlawed and desperate himself, Darsie could not doubt that his uncle\r\nwas surrounded by men capable of anything--that he was restrained by\r\nno personal considerations--and therefore what degree of compulsion he\r\nmight apply to his brother\'s son, or in what manner he might feel at\r\nliberty to punish his contumacy, should he disavow the Jacobite cause,\r\nmust depend entirely upon the limits of his own conscience; and who\r\nwas to answer for the conscience of a heated enthusiast who considers\r\nopposition to the party he has espoused, as treason to the welfare of\r\nhis country? After a short interval, Cristal Nixon was pleased to throw\r\nsome light upon the subject which agitated him.\r\n\r\nWhen that grim satellite rode up without ceremony close to Darsie\'s\r\nside, the latter felt his very flesh creep with abhorrence, so little\r\nwas he able to endure his presence, since the story of Lilias had added\r\nto his instinctive hatred of the man.\r\n\r\nHis voice, too, sounded like that of a screech-owl, as he said, \'So, my\r\nyoung cock of the north, you now know it all, and no doubt are blessing\r\nyour uncle for stirring you up to such an honourable action.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will acquaint my uncle with my sentiments on the subject, before I\r\nmake them known to any one else,\' said Darsie, scarcely prevailing on\r\nhis tongue to utter even these few words in a civil manner.\r\n\r\n\'Umph,\' murmured Cristal betwixt his teeth. \'Close as wax, I see; and\r\nperhaps not quite so pliable. But take care, my pretty youth,\' he added,\r\nscornfully; \'Hugh Redgauntlet will prove a rough colt-breaker--he will\r\nneither spare whipcord nor spur-rowel, I promise you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have already said, Mr. Nixon, answered Darsie, \'that I will canvass\r\nthose matters of which my sister has informed me, with my uncle himself,\r\nand with no other person.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, but a word of friendly advice would do you no harm, young master,\'\r\nreplied Nixon. \'Old Redgauntlet is apter at a blow than a word--likely\r\nto bite before he barks--the true man for giving Scarborough warning,\r\nfirst knock you down, then bid you stand. So, methinks, a little kind\r\nwarning as to consequences were not amiss, lest they come upon you\r\nunawares.\'\r\n\r\n\'If the warning is really kind, Mr. Nixon,\' said the young man, \'I\r\nwill hear it thankfully; and indeed, if otherwise, I must listen to it\r\nwhether I will or no, since I have at present no choice of company or of\r\nconversation.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, I have but little to say,\' said Nixon, affecting to give to his\r\nsullen and dogged manner the appearance of an honest bluntness; \'I am\r\nas little apt to throw away words as any one. But here is the\r\nquestion--Will you join heart and hand with your uncle, or no?\'\r\n\r\n\'What if I should say Aye?\' said Darsie, determined, if possible, to\r\nconceal his resolution from this man.\r\n\r\n\'Why, then,\' said Nixon, somewhat surprised at the readiness of his\r\nanswer, \'all will go smooth, of course--you will take share in this\r\nnoble undertaking, and, when it succeeds, you will exchange your open\r\nhelmet for an earl\'s coronet perhaps.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how if it fails?\' said Darsie.\r\n\r\n\'Thereafter as it may be,\' said Nixon; \'they who play at bowls must meet\r\nwith rubbers.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, but suppose, then, I have some foolish tenderness for my\r\nwindpipe, and that when my uncle proposes the adventure to me I should\r\nsay No--how then, Mr. Nixon?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, then, I would have you look to yourself, young master. There are\r\nsharp laws in France against refractory pupils--LETTRES DE CACHET\r\nare easily come by when such men as we are concerned with interest\r\nthemselves in the matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'But we are not in France,\' said poor Darsie, through whose blood ran a\r\ncold shivering at the idea of a French prison.\r\n\r\n\'A fast-sailing lugger will soon bring you there though, snug stowed\r\nunder hatches, like a cask of moonlight.\'\r\n\r\n\'But the French are at peace with us,\' said Darsie, \'and would not\r\ndare\'--\r\n\r\n\'Why, who would ever hear of you?\' interrupted Nixon; \'do you imagine\r\nthat a foreign court would call you up for judgement, and put the\r\nsentence of imprisonment in the COURRIER DE L\'EUROPE, as they do at the\r\nOld Bailey? No, no, young gentleman--the gates of the Bastille, and of\r\nMont Saint Michel, and the Castle of Vincennes, move on d--d easy hinges\r\nwhen they let folk in--not the least jar is heard. There are cool cells\r\nthere for hot heads--as calm, and quiet, and dark, as you could wish in\r\nBedlam--and the dismissal comes when the carpenter brings the prisoner\'s\r\ncoffin, and not sooner.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mr. Nixon,\' said Darsie, affecting a cheerfulness which he was\r\nfar from feeling, \'mine is a hard case--a sort of hanging choice, you\r\nwill allow--since I must either offend our own government here and\r\nrun the risk of my life for doing so, or be doomed to the dungeons of\r\nanother country, whose laws I have never offended since I have never\r\ntrod its soil--Tell me what you would do if you were in my place.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you that when I am there,\' said Nixon, and, checking his\r\nhorse, fell back to the rear of the little party.\r\n\r\n\'It is evident,\' thought the young man, \'that the villain believes me\r\ncompletely noosed, and perhaps has the ineffable impudence to suppose\r\nthat my sister must eventually succeed to the possessions which have\r\noccasioned my loss of freedom, and that his own influence over the\r\ndestinies of our unhappy family may secure him possession of the\r\nheiress; but he shall perish by my hand first!--I must now be on the\r\nalert to make my escape, if possible, before I am forced on shipboard.\r\nBlind Willie will not, I think, desert me without an effort on my\r\nbehalf, especially if he has learned that I am the son of his late\r\nunhappy patron. What a change is mine! Whilst I possessed neither rank\r\nnor fortune, I lived safely and unknown, under the protection of the\r\nkind and respectable friends whose hearts Heaven had moved towards me.\r\nNow that I am the head of an honourable house, and that enterprises of\r\nthe most daring character await my decision, and retainers and vassals\r\nseem ready to rise at my beck, my safety consists chiefly in the\r\nattachment of a blind stroller!\'\r\n\r\nWhile he was revolving these things in his mind, and preparing himself\r\nfor the interview with his uncle which could not but be a stormy one,\r\nhe saw Hugh Redgauntlet come riding slowly back to meet them without any\r\nattendants. Cristal Nixon rode up as he approached, and, as they met,\r\nfixed on him a look of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\'The fool, Crackenthorp,\' said Redgauntlet, has let strangers into his\r\nhouse. Some of his smuggling comrades, I believe; we must ride slowly to\r\ngive him time to send them packing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you see any of your friends?\' said Cristal.\r\n\r\n\'Three, and have letters from many more. They are unanimous on the\r\nsubject you wot of--and the point must be conceded to them, or, far as\r\nthe matter has gone, it will go no further.\'\r\n\r\n\'You will hardly bring the father to stoop to his flock,\' said Cristal,\r\nwith a sneer.\r\n\r\n\'He must and shall!\' answered Redgauntlet, briefly. \'Go to the front,\r\nCristal--I would speak with my nephew. I trust, Sir Arthur Redgauntlet,\r\nyou are satisfied with the manner in which I have discharged my duty to\r\nyour sister?\'\r\n\r\n\'There can be no fault found to her manners or sentiments,\' answered\r\nDarsie; \'I am happy in knowing a relative so amiable.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad of it,\' answered Mr. Redgauntlet. \'I am no nice judge of\r\nwomen\'s qualifications, and my life has been dedicated to one great\r\nobject; so that since she left France she has had but little opportunity\r\nof improvement. I have subjected her, however, as little as possible to\r\nthe inconveniences and privations of my wandering and dangerous life.\r\nFrom time to time she has resided for weeks and months with families of\r\nhonour and respectability, and I am glad that she has, in, your opinion,\r\nthe manners and behaviour which become her birth.\'\r\n\r\nDarsie expressed himself perfectly satisfied, and there was a little\r\npause, which Redgauntlet broke by solemnly addressing his nephew.\r\n\r\n\'For you, my nephew, I also hoped to have done much. The weakness and\r\ntimidity of your mother sequestered you from my care, or it would have\r\nbeen my pride and happiness to have trained up the son of my unhappy\r\nbrother in those paths of honour in which our ancestors have always\r\ntrod.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now comes the storm,\' thought Darsie to himself, and began to collect\r\nhis thoughts, as the cautious master of a vessel furls his sails and\r\nmakes his ship snug when he discerns the approaching squall.\r\n\r\n\'My mother\'s conduct in respect to me might be misjudged,\' he said, \'but\r\nit was founded on the most anxious affection.\'\r\n\r\n\'Assuredly,\' said his uncle, \'and I have no wish to reflect on her\r\nmemory, though her mistrust has done so much injury, I will not say to\r\nme, but to the cause of my unhappy country. Her scheme was, I think,\r\nto have made you that wretched pettifogging being, which they still\r\ncontinue to call in derision by the once respectable name of a Scottish\r\nAdvocate; one of those mongrel things that must creep to learn the\r\nultimate decision of his causes to the bar of a foreign court, instead\r\nof pleading before the independent and august Parliament of his own\r\nnative kingdom.\'\r\n\r\n\'I did prosecute the study of law for a year or two, said Darsie, \'but I\r\nfound I had neither taste nor talents for the science.\'\r\n\r\n\'And left it with scorn, doubtless,\' said Mr. Redgauntlet. \'Well, I now\r\nhold up to you, my dearest nephew, a more worthy object of ambition.\r\nLook eastward--do you see a monument standing on yonder plain, near a\r\nhamlet?\'\r\n\r\nDarsie replied that he did,\r\n\r\n\'The hamlet is called Burgh-upon-Sands, and yonder monument is erected\r\nto the memory of the tyrant Edward I. The just hand of Providence\r\novertook him on that spot, as he was leading his bands to complete the\r\nsubjugation of Scotland whose civil dissensions began under his accursed\r\npolicy. The glorious career of Bruce might have been stopped in its\r\noutset; the field of Bannockburn might have remained a bloodless turf,\r\nif God had not removed, in the very crisis, the crafty and bold tyrant\r\nwho had so long been Scotland\'s scourge. Edward\'s grave is the cradle of\r\nour national freedom. It is within sight of that great landmark of our\r\nliberty that I have to propose to you an undertaking, second in honour\r\nand importance to none since the immortal Bruce stabbed the Red Comyn,\r\nand grasped with his yet bloody hand the independent crown of Scotland.\'\r\n\r\nHe paused for an answer; but Darsie, overawed by the energy of his\r\nmanner, and unwilling to commit himself by a hasty explanation, remained\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\'I will not suppose,\' said Hugh Redgauntlet, after a pause, that you\r\nare either so dull as not to comprehend the import of my words--or so\r\ndastardly as to be dismayed by my proposal--or so utterly degenerate\r\nfrom the blood and sentiments of your ancestors, as not to feel my\r\nsummons as the horse hears the war-trumpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will not pretend to misunderstand you, sir,\' said Darsie; \'but an\r\nenterprise directed against a dynasty now established for three reigns\r\nrequires strong arguments, both in point of justice and of expediency,\r\nto recommend it to men of conscience and prudence.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will not,\' said Redgauntlet, while his eyes sparkled with anger,--\'I\r\nwill not hear you speak a word against the justice of that enterprise,\r\nfor which your oppressed country calls with the voice of a parent,\r\nentreating her children for aid--or against that noble revenge which\r\nyour father\'s blood demands from his dishonoured grave. His skull is\r\nyet standing over the Rikargate, [The northern gate of Carlisle was long\r\ngarnished with the heads of the Scottish rebels executed in 1746.] and\r\neven its bleak and mouldered jaws command you to be a man. I ask you,\r\nin the name of God and of your country, will you draw your sword and\r\ngo with me to Carlisle, were it but to lay your father\'s head, now the\r\nperch of the obscene owl and carrion crow and the scoff of every ribald\r\nclown, in consecrated earth as befits his long ancestry?\'\r\n\r\nDarsie, unprepared to answer an appeal urged with so much passion, and\r\nnot doubting a direct refusal would cost him his liberty or life, was\r\nagain silent.\r\n\r\n\'I see,\' said his uncle, in a more composed tone, \'that it is not\r\ndeficiency of spirit, but the grovelling habits of a confined education,\r\namong the poor-spirited class you were condemned to herd with, that\r\nkeeps you silent. You scarce yet believe yourself a Redgauntlet; your\r\npulse has not yet learned the genuine throb that answers to the summons\r\nof honour and of patriotism.\'\r\n\r\n\'I trust,\' replied Darsie, at last, \'that I shall never be found\r\nindifferent to the call of either; but to answer them with effect--even\r\nwere I convinced that they now sounded in my ear--I must see some\r\nreasonable hope of success in the desperate enterprise in which you\r\nwould involve me. I look around me, and I see a settled government--an\r\nestablished authority--a born Briton on the throne--the very Highland\r\nmountaineers, upon whom alone the trust of the exiled family reposed,\r\nassembled into regiments which act under the orders of the existing\r\ndynasty. [The Highland regiments were first employed by the celebrated\r\nEarl of Chatham, who assumed to himself no small degree of praise for\r\nhaving called forth to the support of the country and the government,\r\nthe valour which had been too often directed against both.] France has\r\nbeen utterly dismayed by the tremendous lessons of the last war, and\r\nwill hardly provoke another. All without and within the kingdom is\r\nadverse to encountering a hopeless struggle, and you alone, sir, seem\r\nwilling to undertake a desperate enterprise.\'\r\n\r\n\'And would undertake it were it ten times more desperate; and have\r\nagitated it when ten times the obstacles were interposed. Have I forgot\r\nmy brother\'s blood? Can I--dare I even now repeat the Pater Noster,\r\nsince my enemies and the murderers remain unforgiven? Is there an art I\r\nhave not practised--a privation to which I have not submitted, to bring\r\non the crisis, which I now behold arrived? Have I not been a vowed and a\r\ndevoted man, forgoing every comfort of social life, renouncing even the\r\nexercise of devotion unless when I might name in prayer my prince and\r\ncountry, submitting to everything to make converts to this noble cause?\r\nHave I done all this, and shall I now stop short?\' Darsie was about to\r\ninterrupt him, but he pressed his hand affectionately upon his shoulder,\r\nand enjoining, or rather imploring, silence, \'Peace,\' he said, \'heir of\r\nmy ancestors\' fame--heir of all my hopes and wishes. Peace, son of my\r\nslaughtered brother! I have sought for thee, and mourned for thee, as\r\na mother for an only child. Do not let me again lose you in the moment\r\nwhen you are restored to my hopes. Believe me, I distrust so much my own\r\nimpatient temper, that I entreat you, as the dearest boon, do naught to\r\nawaken it at this crisis.\'\r\n\r\nDarsie was not sorry to reply that his respect for the person of his\r\nrelation would induce him to listen to all which he had to apprise him\r\nof, before he formed any definite resolution upon the weighty subjects\r\nof deliberation which he proposed to him.\r\n\r\n\'Deliberation!\' repeated Redgauntlet, impatiently; \'and yet it is not\r\nill said. I wish there had been more warmth in thy reply, Arthur; but I\r\nmust recollect, were an eagle bred in a falcon\'s mew and hooded like a\r\nreclaimed hawk, he could not at first gaze steadily on the sun. Listen\r\nto me, my dearest Arthur. The state of this nation no more implies\r\nprosperity, than the florid colour of a feverish patient is a symptom\r\nof health. All is false and hollow. The apparent success of Chatham\'s\r\nadministration has plunged the country deeper in debt than all the\r\nbarren acres of Canada are worth, were they as fertile as Yorkshire--the\r\ndazzling lustre of the victories of Minden and Quebec have been dimmed\r\nby the disgrace of the hasty peace--by the war, England, at immense\r\nexpense, gained nothing but honour, and that she has gratuitously\r\nresigned. Many eyes, formerly cold and indifferent, are now looking\r\ntowards the line of our ancient and rightful monarchs, as the only\r\nrefuge in the approaching storm--the rich are alarmed--the nobles are\r\ndisgusted--the populace are inflamed--and a band of patriots, whose\r\nmeasures are more safe than their numbers are few, have resolved to set\r\nup King Charles\'s standard.\'\r\n\r\n\'But the military,\' said Darsie--\'how can you, with a body of unarmed\r\nand disorderly insurgents, propose to encounter a regular army. The\r\nHighlanders are now totally disarmed.\'\r\n\r\n\'In a great measure, perhaps,\' answered Redgauntlet; \'but the policy\r\nwhich raised the Highland regiments has provided for that. We have\r\nalready friends in these corps; nor can we doubt for a moment what their\r\nconduct will be when the white cockade is once more mounted. The rest\r\nof the standing army has been greatly reduced since the peace; and we\r\nreckon confidently on our standard being joined by thousands of the\r\ndisbanded troops.\'\r\n\r\n\'Alas!\' said Darsie, \'and is it upon such vague hopes as these, the\r\ninconstant humour of a crowd or of a disbanded soldiery, that men of\r\nhonour are invited to risk their families, their property, their life?\'\r\n\r\n\'Men of honour, boy,\' said Redgauntlet, his eyes glancing with\r\nimpatience, \'set life, property, family, and all at stake, when that\r\nhonour commands it! We are not now weaker than when seven men, landing\r\nin the wilds of Moidart, shook the throne of the usurper till it\r\ntottered--won two pitched fields, besides overrunning one kingdom and\r\nthe half of another, and, but for treachery, would have achieved what\r\ntheir venturous successors are now to attempt in their turn.\'\r\n\r\n\'And will such an attempt be made in serious earnest?\' said Darsie.\r\n\'Excuse me, my uncle, if I can scarce believe a fact so extraordinary.\r\nWill there really be found men of rank and consequence sufficient to\r\nrenew the adventure of 1745?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will not give you my confidence by halves, Sir Arthur,\' replied his\r\nuncle--\'Look at that scroll--what say you to these names?--Are they not\r\nthe flower of the western shires--of Wales of Scotland?\'\r\n\r\n\'The paper contains indeed the names of many that are great and noble,\'\r\nreplied Darsie, after perusing it; \'but\'--\r\n\r\n\'But what?\' asked his uncle, impatiently; \'do you doubt the ability of\r\nthose nobles and gentlemen to furnish the aid in men and money at which\r\nthey are rated?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not their ability certainly,\' said Darsie, \'for of that I am no\r\ncompetent judge; but I see in this scroll the name of Sir Arthur Darsie\r\nRedgauntlet of that Ilk, rated at a hundred men and upwards--I certainly\r\nam ignorant how he is to redeem that pledge.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will be responsible for the men,\' replied Hugh Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\n\'But, my dear uncle,\' added Darsie, \'I hope for your sake that the other\r\nindividuals whose names are here written, have had more acquaintance\r\nwith your plan than I have been indulged with.\'\r\n\r\n\'For thee and thine I can be myself responsible,\' said Redgauntlet; \'for\r\nif thou hast not the courage to head the force of thy house, the leading\r\nshall pass to other hands, and thy inheritance shall depart from thee\r\nlike vigour and verdure from a rotten branch. For these honourable\r\npersons, a slight condition there is which they annex to their\r\nfriendship--something so trifling that it is scarce worthy of mention.\r\nThis boon granted to them by him who is most interested, there is no\r\nquestion they will take the field in the manner there stated.\'\r\n\r\nAgain Darsie perused the paper, and felt himself still less inclined to\r\nbelieve that so many men of family and fortune were likely to embark in\r\nan enterprise so fatal. It seemed as if some rash plotter had put\r\ndown at a venture the names of all whom common report tainted with\r\nJacobitism; or if it was really the act of the individuals named, he\r\nsuspected that they must be aware of some mode of excusing themselves\r\nfrom compliance with its purport. It was impossible, he thought, that\r\nEnglishmen, of large fortune, who had failed to join Charles when he\r\nbroke into England at the head of a victorious army, should have the\r\nleast thoughts of encouraging a descent when circumstances were so much\r\nless propitious. He therefore concluded the enterprise would fall to\r\npieces of itself, and that his best way was, in the meantime, to remain\r\nsilent, unless the actual approach of a crisis (which might, however,\r\nnever arrive) should compel him to give a downright refusal to his\r\nuncle\'s proposition; and if, in the interim, some door for escape should\r\nbe opened, he resolved within himself not to omit availing himself of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHugh Redgauntlet watched his nephew\'s looks for some time, and then, as\r\nif arriving from some other process of reasoning at the same conclusion,\r\nhe said, \'I have told you, Sir Arthur, that I do not urge your immediate\r\naccession to my proposal; indeed the consequences of a refusal would be\r\nso dreadful to yourself, so destructive to all the hopes which I have\r\nnursed, that I would not risk, by a moment\'s impatience, the object of\r\nmy whole life. Yes, Arthur, I have been a self-denying hermit at one\r\ntime--at another, the apparent associate of outlaws and desperadoes--at\r\nanother, the subordinate agent of men whom I felt in every way my\r\ninferiors--not for any selfish purpose of my own, no, not even to win\r\nfor myself the renown of being the principal instrument in restoring\r\nmy king and freeing my country. My first wish on earth is for\r\nthat restoration and that freedom--my next, that my nephew, the\r\nrepresentative of my house and of the brother of my love, may have the\r\nadvantage and the credit of all my efforts in the good cause. But,\' he\r\nadded, darting on Darsie one of his withering frowns, \'if Scotland and\r\nmy father\'s house cannot stand and flourish together, then perish the\r\nvery name of Redgauntlet! perish the son of my brother, with every\r\nrecollection of the glories of my family, of the affections of my youth,\r\nrather than my country\'s cause should be injured in the tithing of\r\na barley-corn! The spirit of Sir Alberick is alive within me at this\r\nmoment,\' he continued, drawing up his stately form and sitting erect in\r\nhis saddle, while he pressed his finger against his forehead; \'and if\r\nyou yourself crossed my path in opposition, I swear, by the mark that\r\ndarkens my brow, that a new deed should be done--a new doom should be\r\ndeserved!\'\r\n\r\nHe was silent, and his threats were uttered in a tone of voice so deeply\r\nresolute, that Darsie\'s heart sank within him, when he reflected on the\r\nstorm of passion which he must encounter, if he declined to join his\r\nuncle in a project to which prudence and principle made him equally\r\nadverse. He had scarce any hope left but in temporizing until he could\r\nmake his escape, and resolved to avail himself for that purpose of the\r\ndelay which his uncle seemed not unwilling to grant. The stern,\r\ngloomy look of his companion became relaxed by degrees, and presently\r\nafterwards he made a sign to Miss Redgauntlet to join the party, and\r\nbegan a forced conversation on ordinary topics; in the course of which\r\nDarsie observed that his sister seemed to speak under the most cautious\r\nrestraint, weighing every word before she uttered it, and always\r\npermitting her uncle to give the tone to the conversation, though of the\r\nmost trifling kind. This seemed to him (such an opinion had he already\r\nentertained of his sister\'s good sense and firmness) the strongest proof\r\nhe had yet received of his uncle\'s peremptory character, since he saw it\r\nobserved with so much deference by a young person whose sex might have\r\ngiven her privileges, and who seemed by no means deficient either in\r\nspirit or firmness.\r\n\r\nThe little cavalcade was now approaching the house of Father\r\nCrackenthorp, situated, as the reader knows, by the side of the\r\nSolway, and not far distant front a rude pier, near which lay several\r\nfishing-boats, which frequently acted in a different capacity. The house\r\nof the worthy publican was also adapted to the various occupations which\r\nhe carried on, being a large scrambling assemblage of cottages attached\r\nto a house of two stories, roofed with flags of sandstone--the original\r\nmansion, to which the extensions of Mr. Crackenthorp\'s trade had\r\noccasioned his making many additions. Instead of the single long\r\nwatering-trough which usually distinguishes the front of the English\r\npublic-house of the second class, there were three conveniences of that\r\nkind, for the use, as the landlord used to say, of the troop-horses when\r\nthe soldiers came to search his house; while a knowing leer and a nod\r\nlet you understand what species of troops he was thinking of. A huge\r\nash-tree before the door, which had reared itself to a great size\r\nand height, in spite of the blasts from the neighbouring Solway,\r\novershadowed, as usual, the ale-bench, as our ancestors called it,\r\nwhere, though it was still early in the day, several fellows, who seemed\r\nto be gentlemen\'s servants, were drinking beer and smoking. One or two\r\nof them wore liveries which seemed known to Mr. Redgauntlet, for he\r\nmuttered between his teeth, \'Fools, fools! were they on a march to hell,\r\nthey must have their rascals in livery with them, that the whole world\r\nmight know who were going to be damned.\'\r\n\r\nAs he thus muttered, he drew bridle before the door of the place,\r\nfrom which several other lounging guests began to issue, to look with\r\nindolent curiosity as usual, upon an ARRIVAL.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet sprang from his horse, and assisted his niece to dismount;\r\nbut, forgetting, perhaps, his nephew\'s disguise, he did not pay him the\r\nattention which his female dress demanded.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Darsie was indeed something awkward; for Cristal Nixon,\r\nout of caution perhaps to prevent escape, had muffled the extreme folds\r\nof the riding-skirt with which he was accoutred, around his ankles and\r\nunder his feet, and there secured it with large corking-pins. We presume\r\nthat gentlemen-cavaliers may sometimes cast their eyes to that part\r\nof the person of the fair equestrians whom they chance occasionally to\r\nescort; and if they will conceive their own feet, like Darsie\'s, muffled\r\nin such a labyrinth of folds and amplitude of robe, as modesty doubtless\r\ninduces the fair creatures to assume upon such occasions, they will\r\nallow that, on a first attempt, they might find some awkwardness in\r\ndismounting. Darsie, at least, was in such a predicament, for, not\r\nreceiving adroit assistance from the attendant of Mr. Redgauntlet, he\r\nstumbled as he dismounted from the horse, and might have had a bad fall,\r\nhad it not been broken by the gallant interposition of a gentleman, who\r\nprobably was, on his part, a little surprised at the solid weight of the\r\ndistressed fair one whom he had the honour to receive in his embrace.\r\nBut what was his surprise to that of Darsie, when the hurry of the\r\nmoment and of the accident, permitted him to see that it was his friend\r\nAlan Fairford in whose arms he found himself! A thousand apprehensions\r\nrushed on him, mingled with the full career of hope and joy, inspired by\r\nthe unexpected appearance of his beloved friend at the very crisis, it\r\nseemed, of his fate.\r\n\r\nHe was about to whisper in his ear, cautioning him at the same time to\r\nbe silent; yet he hesitated for a second or two to effect his purpose,\r\nsince, should Redgauntlet take the alarm from any sudden exclamation on\r\nthe part of Alan, there was no saying what consequences might ensue.\r\n\r\nEre he could decide what was to be done, Redgauntlet, who had entered\r\nthe house, returned hastily, followed by Cristal Nixon. \'I\'ll release\r\nyou of the charge of this young lady, sir;\' he said, haughtily, to Alan\r\nFairford, whom he probably did not recognize.\r\n\r\n\'I had no desire to intrude, sir,\' replied Alan; \'the lady\'s situation\r\nseemed to require assistance--and--but have I not the honour to speak to\r\nMr. Herries of Birrenswork?\'\r\n\r\n\'You are mistaken, sir,\' said Redgauntlet, turning short off, and\r\nmaking a sign with his hand to Cristal, who hurried Darsie, however\r\nunwillingly, into the house, whispering in his ear, \'Come, miss, let us\r\nhave no making of acquaintance from the windows. Ladies of fashion must\r\nbe private. Show us a room, Father Crackenthorp.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he conducted Darsie into the house, interposing at the same\r\ntime his person betwixt the supposed young lady and the stranger of whom\r\nhe was suspicious, so as to make communication by signs impossible. As\r\nthey entered, they heard the sound of a fiddle in the stone-floored\r\nand well-sanded kitchen, through which they were about to follow their\r\ncorpulent host, and where several people seemed engaged in dancing to\r\nits strains.\r\n\r\n\'D--n thee,\' said Nixon to Crackenthorp, \'would you have the lady go\r\nthrough all the mob of the parish? Hast thou no more private way to our\r\nsitting-room?\'\r\n\r\n\'None that is fit for my travelling,\' answered the landlord, laying his\r\nhand on his portly stomach. \'I am not Tom Turnpenny, to creep like a\r\nlizard through keyholes.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he kept moving on through the revellers in the kitchen; and\r\nNixon, holding Darsie by his arm, as if to offer the lady support but\r\nin all probability to frustrate any effort at escape, moved through the\r\ncrowd, which presented a very motley appearance, consisting of domestic\r\nservants, country fellows, seamen, and other idlers, whom Wandering\r\nWillie was regaling with his music.\r\n\r\nTo pass another friend without intimation of his presence would have\r\nbeen actual pusillanimity; and just when they were passing the blind\r\nman\'s elevated seat, Darsie asked him with some emphasis, whether he\r\ncould not play a Scottish air? The man\'s face had been the instant\r\nbefore devoid of all sort of expression, going through his performance\r\nlike a clown through a beautiful country, too much accustomed to\r\nconsider it as a task, to take any interest in the performance, and, in\r\nfact, scarce seeming to hear the noise that he was creating. In a\r\nword, he might at the time have made a companion to my friend Wilkie\'s\r\ninimitable blind crowder. But with Wandering Willie this was only an\r\noccasional and a rare fit of dullness, such as will at times creep over\r\nall the professors of the fine arts, arising either from fatigue, or\r\ncontempt of the present audience, or that caprice which so often tempts\r\npainters and musicians and great actors, in the phrase of the latter, to\r\nwalk through their part, instead of exerting themselves with the energy\r\nwhich acquired their fame. But when the performer heard the voice of\r\nDarsie, his countenance became at once illuminated, and showed the\r\ncomplete mistake of those who suppose that the principal point of\r\nexpression depends upon the eyes. With his face turned to the point from\r\nwhich the sound came, his upper lip a little curved, and quivering with\r\nagitation, and with a colour which surprise and pleasure had brought at\r\nonce into his faded cheek, he exchanged the humdrum hornpipe which he\r\nhad been sawing out with reluctant and lazy bow, for the fine Scottish\r\nair,\r\n\r\n  You\'re welcome, Charlie Stuart,\r\n\r\nwhich flew from his strings as if by inspiration and after a breathless\r\npause of admiration among the audience, was received with a clamour of\r\napplause, which seemed to show that the name and tendency, as well as\r\nthe execution of the tune, was in the highest degree acceptable to all\r\nthe party assembled.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Cristal Nixon, still keeping hold of Darsie, and\r\nfollowing the landlord, forced his way with some difficulty through the\r\ncrowded kitchen, and entered a small apartment on the other side of it,\r\nwhere they found Lilias Redgauntlet already seated. Here Nixon gave\r\nway to his suppressed resentment, and turning sternly on Crackenthorp,\r\nthreatened him with his master\'s severest displeasure, because things\r\nwere in such bad order to receive his family, when he had given such\r\nspecial advice that he desired to be private. But Father Crackenthorp\r\nwas not a man to be brow-beaten.\r\n\r\n\'Why, brother Nixon, thou art angry this morning,\' he replied; \'hast\r\nrisen from thy wrong side, I think. You know, as well as I, that most of\r\nthis mob is of the squire\'s own making--gentlemen that come with their\r\nservants, and so forth, to meet him in the way of business, as old Tom\r\nTurnpenny says--the very last that came was sent down with Dick Gardener\r\nfrom Fairladies.\'\r\n\r\n\'But the blind scraping scoundrel yonder,\' said Nixon, \'how dared you\r\ntake such a rascal as that across your threshold at such a time as this?\r\nIf the squire should dream you have a thought of peaching--I am only\r\nspeaking for your good, Father Crackenthorp.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, look ye, brother Nixon,\' said Crackenthorp, turning his quid with\r\ngreat composure, \'the squire is a very worthy gentleman, and I\'ll never\r\ndeny it; but I am neither his servant nor his tenant, and so he need\r\nsend me none of his orders till he hears I have put on his livery. As\r\nfor turning away folk from my door, I might as well plug up the ale-tap,\r\nand pull down the sign--and as for peaching, and such like, the squire\r\nwill find the folk here are as honest to the full as those he brings\r\nwith him.\'\r\n\r\n\'How, you impudent lump of tallow,\' said Nixon, \'what do you mean by\r\nthat?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' said Crackenthorp, \'but that I can tour out as well as\r\nanother--you understand me--keep good lights in my upper story--know a\r\nthing or two more than most folk in this country. If folk will come to\r\nmy house on dangerous errands, egad they shall not find Joe Crackenthorp\r\na cat\'s-paw. I\'ll keep myself clear, you may depend on it, and let every\r\nman answer for his own actions--that\'s my way. Anything wanted, Master\r\nNixon?\'\r\n\r\n\'No--yes--begone!\' said Nixon, who seemed embarrassed with the\r\nlandlord\'s contumacy, yet desirous to conceal the effect it produced on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe door was no sooner closed on Crackenthorp, than Miss Redgauntlet,\r\naddressing Nixon, commanded him to leave the room and go to his proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\'How, madam?\' said the fellow sullenly, yet with an air of respect,\r\n\'Would you have your uncle pistol me for disobeying his orders?\'\r\n\r\n\'He may perhaps pistol you for some other reason, if you do not obey\r\nmine,\' said Lilias, composedly.\r\n\r\n\'You abuse your advantage over me, madam--I really dare not go--I am on\r\nguard over this other miss here; and if I should desert my post, my life\r\nwere not worth five minutes\' purchase.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then know your post, sir,\' said Lilias, \'and watch on the outside of\r\nthe door. You have no commission to listen to our private conversation,\r\nI suppose? Begone, sir, without further speech or remonstrance, or I\r\nwill tell my uncle that which you would have reason to repent be should\r\nknow.\'\r\n\r\nThe fellow looked at her with a singular expression of spite, mixed\r\nwith deference. \'You abuse your advantages, madam,\' he said, \'and act as\r\nfoolishly in doing so as I did in affording you such a hank over me. But\r\nyou are a tyrant; and tyrants have commonly short reigns.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he left the apartment.\r\n\r\n\'The wretch\'s unparalleled insolence,\' said Lilias to her brother, \'has\r\ngiven me one great advantage over him. For knowing that my uncle would\r\nshoot him with as little remorse as a woodcock, if he but guessed at his\r\nbrazen-faced assurance towards me, he dares not since that time assume,\r\nso far as I am concerned, the air of insolent domination which the\r\npossession of my uncle\'s secrets, and the knowledge of his most secret\r\nplans, have led him to exert over others of his family.\'\r\n\r\n\'In the meantime,\' said Darsie, \'I am happy to see that the landlord\r\nof the house does not seem so devoted to him as I apprehended; and this\r\naids the hope of escape which I am nourishing for you and for myself. O\r\nLilias! the truest of friends, Alan Fairford, is in pursuit of me, and\r\nis here at this moment. Another humble, but, I think, faithful friend,\r\nis also within these dangerous walls.\'\r\n\r\nLilias laid her finger on her lips, and pointed to the door. Darsie took\r\nthe hint, lowered his voice, and informed her in whispers of the arrival\r\nof Fairford, and that he believed he had opened a communication with\r\nWandering Willie. She listened with the utmost interest, and had just\r\nbegun to reply, when a loud noise was heard in the kitchen, caused\r\nby several contending voices, amongst which Darsie thought he could\r\ndistinguish that of Alan Fairford.\r\n\r\nForgetting how little his own condition permitted him to become the\r\nassistant of another, Darsie flew to the door of the room, and finding\r\nit locked and bolted on the outside, rushed against it with all\r\nhis force, and made the most desperate efforts to burst it open,\r\nnotwithstanding the entreaties of his sister that he would compose\r\nhimself and recollect the condition in which he was placed. But the\r\ndoor, framed to withstand attacks from excisemen, constables, and other\r\npersonages, considered as worthy to use what are called the king\'s keys,\r\n[In common parlance, a crowbar and hatchet.] \'and therewith to make\r\nlockfast places open and patent,\' set his efforts at defiance. Meantime\r\nthe noise continued without, and we are to give an account of its origin\r\nin our next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF DARSIE LATIMER, CONTINUED\r\n\r\nJoe Crackenthorp\'s public-house had never, since it first reared\r\nits chimneys on the banks of the Solway, been frequented by such a\r\nmiscellaneous group of visitors as had that morning become its guests.\r\nSeveral of them were persons whose quality seemed much superior to\r\ntheir dresses and modes of travelling. The servants who attended them\r\ncontradicted the inferences to be drawn from the garb of their masters,\r\nand, according to the custom of the knights of the rainbow, gave many\r\nhints that they were not people to serve any but men of first-rate\r\nconsequence. These gentlemen, who had come thither chiefly for the\r\npurpose of meeting with Mr. Redgauntlet, seemed moody and anxious,\r\nconversed and walked together apparently in deep conversation, and\r\navoided any communication with the chance travellers whom accident\r\nbrought that morning to the same place of resort.\r\n\r\nAs if Fate had set herself to confound the plans of the Jacobite\r\nconspirators, the number of travellers was unusually great, their\r\nappearance respectable, and they filled the public tap-room of the inn,\r\nwhere the political guests had already occupied most of the private\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nAmongst others, honest Joshua Geddes had arrived, travelling, as he\r\nsaid, in the sorrow of the soul, and mourning for the fate of Darsie\r\nLatimer as he would for his first-born child. He had skirted the whole\r\ncoast of the Solway, besides making various trips into the interior,\r\nnot shunning, on such occasions, to expose himself to the laugh of the\r\nscorner, nay, even to serious personal risk, by frequenting the haunts\r\nof smugglers, horse-jockeys, and other irregular persons, who looked\r\non his intrusion with jealous eyes, and were apt to consider him as\r\nan exciseman in the disguise of a Quaker. All this labour and peril,\r\nhowever, had been undergone in vain. No search he could make obtained\r\nthe least intelligence of Latimer, so that he began to fear the poor lad\r\nhad been spirited abroad--for the practice of kidnapping was then not\r\ninfrequent, especially on the western coasts of Britain--if indeed he\r\nhad escaped a briefer and more bloody fate.\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart, he delivered his horse, even Solomon, into the hands\r\nof the ostler, and walking into the inn, demanded from the landlord\r\nbreakfast and a private room. Quakers, and such hosts as old Father\r\nCrackenthorp, are no congenial spirits; the latter looked askew over his\r\nshoulder, and replied, \'If you would have breakfast here, friend, you\r\nare like to eat it where other folk eat theirs.\'\r\n\r\n\'And wherefore can I not,\' said the Quaker, \'have an apartment to\r\nmyself, for my money?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because, Master Jonathan, you must wait till your betters be served, or\r\nelse eat with your equals.\'\r\n\r\nJoshua Geddes argued the point no further, but sitting quietly down on\r\nthe seat which Crackenthorp indicated to him, and calling for a pint\r\nof ale, with some bread, butter, and Dutch cheese, began to satisfy the\r\nappetite which the morning air had rendered unusually alert.\r\n\r\nWhile the honest Quaker was thus employed, another stranger entered the\r\napartment, and sat down near to the table on which his victuals were\r\nplaced. He looked repeatedly at Joshua, licked his parched and chopped\r\nlips as he saw the good Quaker masticate his bread and cheese, and\r\nsucked up his thin chops when Mr. Geddes applied the tankard to his\r\nmouth, as if the discharge of these bodily functions by another had\r\nawakened his sympathies in an uncontrollable degree. At last, being\r\napparently unable to withstand his longings, he asked, in a faltering\r\ntone, the huge landlord, who was tramping through the room in all\r\ncorpulent impatience, whether he could have a plack-pie?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never heard of such a thing, master,\' said the landlord, and was about\r\nto trudge onward; when the guest, detaining him, said, in a strong\r\nScottish tone, \'Ya will maybe have nae whey then, nor buttermilk, nor ye\r\ncouldna exhibit a souter\'s clod?\'\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t tell what ye are talking about, master,\' said Crackenthorp.\r\n\r\n\'Then ye will have nae breakfast that will come within \'the compass of a\r\nshilling Scots?\'\r\n\r\n\'Which is a penny sterling,\' answered Crackenthorp, with a sneer. \'Why,\r\nno, Sawney, I can\'t say as we have--we can\'t afford it; But you shall\r\nhave a bellyful for love, as we say in the bull-ring.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall never refuse a fair offer,\' said the poverty-stricken guest;\r\n\'and I will say that for the English, if they were deils, that they are\r\na ceeveleesed people to gentlemen that are under a cloud.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gentlemen!--humph!\' said Crackenthorp--\'not a blue-cap among them but\r\nhalts upon that foot.\' Then seizing on a dish which still contained a\r\nhuge cantle of what had been once a princely mutton pasty, he placed\r\nit on the table before the stranger, saying, \'There, master gentleman;\r\nthere is what is worth all the black pies, as you call them, that were\r\never made of sheep\'s head.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sheep\'s head is a gude thing, for a\' that,\' replied the guest; but\r\nnot being spoken so loud as to offend his hospitable entertainer, the\r\ninterjection might pass for a private protest against the scandal thrown\r\nout against the standing dish of Caledonia.\r\n\r\nThis premised, he immediately began to transfer the mutton and\r\npie-crust from his plate to his lips, in such huge gobbets, as if he was\r\nrefreshing after a three days\' fast, and laying in provisions against a\r\nwhole Lent to come.\r\n\r\nJoshua Geddes in his turn gazed on him with surprise, having never, he\r\nthought, beheld such a gaunt expression of hunger in the act of eating.\r\n\'Friend,\' he said, after watching him for some minutes, \'if thou gorgest\r\nthyself in this fashion, thou wilt assuredly choke. Wilt thou not take a\r\ndraught out of my cup to help down all that dry meat?\'\r\n\r\n\'Troth,\' said the stranger, stopping and looking at the friendly\r\npropounder, \'that\'s nae bad overture, as they say in the General\r\nAssembly. I have heard waur motions than that frae wiser counsel.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Geddes ordered a quart of home-brewed to be placed before our friend\r\nPeter Peebles; for the reader must have already conceived that this\r\nunfortunate litigant was the wanderer in question.\r\n\r\nThe victim of Themis had no sooner seen the flagon, than he seized\r\nit with the same energy which he had displayed in operating upon the\r\npie--puffed off the froth with such emphasis, that some of it lighted on\r\nMr. Geddes\'s head--and then said, as if with it sudden recollection of\r\nwhat was due to civility, \'Here\'s to ye, friend. What! are ye ower grand\r\nto give me an answer, or are ye dull o\' hearing?\'\r\n\r\n\'I prithee drink thy liquor, friend,\' said the good Quaker; \'thou\r\nmeanest it in civility, but we care not for these idle fashions.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! ye are a Quaker, are ye?\' said Peter; and without further\r\nceremony reared the flagon to his head, from which he withdrew it not\r\nwhile a single drop of \'barley-broo\' remained. \'That\'s done you and\r\nme muckle gude,\' he said, sighing as he set down his pot; \'but twa\r\nmutchkins o\' yill between twa folk is a drappie ower little measure.\r\nWhat say ye to anither pot? or shall we cry in a blithe Scots pint at\r\nance? The yill is no amiss.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thou mayst call for what thou wilt on thine own charges, friend,\' said\r\nGeddes; \'for myself, I willingly contribute to the quenching of thy\r\nnatural thirst; but I fear it were no such easy matter to relieve thy\r\nacquired and artificial drought.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is to say, in plain terms, ye are for withdrawing your caution\r\nwith the folk of the house? You Quaker folk are but fause comforters;\r\nbut since ye have garred me drink sae muckle cauld yill--me that am no\r\nused to the like of it in the forenoon--I think ye might as weel have\r\noffered me a glass of brandy or usquabae--I\'m nae nice body--I can drink\r\nonything that\'s wet and toothsome.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a drop at my cost, friend,\' quoth Geddes. \'Thou art an old man, and\r\nhast perchance a heavy and long journey before thee. Thou art, moreover,\r\nmy countryman, as I judge from thy tongue; and I will not give thee the\r\nmeans of dishonouring thy grey hairs in a strange land.\'\r\n\r\n\'Grey hairs, neighbour!\' said Peter, with a wink to the bystanders, whom\r\nthis dialogue began to interest, and who were in hopes of seeing the\r\nQuaker played off by the crazed beggar, for such Peter Peebles appeared\r\nto be. \'Grey hairs! The Lord mend your eyesight, neighbour, that disna\r\nken grey hairs frae a tow wig!\'\r\n\r\nThis jest procured a shout of laughter, and, what was still more\r\nacceptable than dry applause, a man who stood beside called out, \'Father\r\nCrackenthorp, bring a nipperkin of brandy. I\'ll bestow a dram on this\r\nfellow, were it but for that very word.\'\r\n\r\nThe brandy was immediately brought by a wench who acted as barmaid; and\r\nPeter, with a grin of delight, filled a glass, quaffed it off, and then\r\nsaying, \'God bless me! I was so unmannerly as not to drink to ye--I\r\nthink the Quaker has smitten me wi\' his ill-bred havings,\'--he was about\r\nto fill another, when his hand was arrested by his new friend; who said\r\nat the same time, \'No, no, friend--fair play\'s a jewel--time about, if\r\nyou please.\' And filling a glass for himself, emptied it as gallantly\r\nas Peter could have done. \'What say you to that, friend?\' he continued,\r\naddressing the Quaker.\r\n\r\n\'Nay, friend,\' answered Joshua, \'it went down thy throat, not mine; and\r\nI have nothing to say about what concerns me not; but if thou art a\r\nman of humanity, thou wilt not give this poor creature the means of\r\ndebauchery. Bethink thee that they will spurn him from the door, as\r\nthey would do a houseless and masterless dog, and that he may die on the\r\nsands or on the common. And if he has through thy means been rendered\r\nincapable of helping himself, thou shalt not be innocent of his blood.\'\r\n\r\n\'Faith, Broadbrim, I believe thou art right, and the old gentleman in\r\nthe flaxen jazy shall have no more of the comforter. Besides, we have\r\nbusiness in hand to-day, and this fellow, for as mad as he looks, may\r\nhave a nose on his face after all. Hark ye, father,--what is your name,\r\nand what brings you into such an out-of-the-way corner?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not just free to condescend on my name,\' said Peter; \'and as for\r\nmy business--there is a wee dribble of brandy in the stoup--it would be\r\nwrang to leave it to the lass--it is learning her bad usages.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, thou shalt have the brandy, and be d--d to thee, if thou wilt\r\ntell me what you are making here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Seeking a young advocate chap that they ca\' Alan Fairford, that has\r\nplayed me a slippery trick, and ye maun ken a\' about the cause,\' said\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n\'An advocate, man!\' answered the captain of the JUMPING JENNY--for it\r\nwas he, and no other, who had taken compassion on Peter\'s drought;\r\n\'why, Lord help thee, thou art on the wrong side of the Firth to seek\r\nadvocates, whom I take to be Scottish lawyers, not English.\'\r\n\r\n\'English lawyers, man!\' exclaimed Peter, \'the deil a lawyer\'s in a\'\r\nEngland.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish from my soul it were true,\' said Ewart; \'but what the devil put\r\nthat in your head?\'\r\n\r\n\'Lord, man, I got a grip of ane of their attorneys in Carlisle, and he\r\ntauld me that there wasna a lawyer in England ony mair than himsell that\r\nkend the nature of a multiple-poinding! And when I told him how this\r\nloopy lad, Alan Fairford, had served me, he said I might bring an action\r\non the case--just as if the case hadna as mony actions already as one\r\ncase can weel carry. By my word, it is a gude case, and muckle has it\r\nborne, in its day, of various procedure--but it\'s the barley-pickle\r\nbreaks the naig\'s back, and wi\' my consent it shall not hae ony mair\r\nburden laid upon it.\'\r\n\r\n\'But this Alan Fairford?\' said Nanty--\'come--sip up the drop of brandy,\r\nman, and tell me some more about him, and whether you are seeking him\r\nfor good or for harm.\'\r\n\r\n\'For my ain gude, and for his harm, to be sure,\' said Peter. \'Think of\r\nhis having left my cause in the dead-thraw between the tyneing and\r\nthe winning, and capering off into Cumberland here, after a wild\r\nloup-the-tether lad they ca\' Darsie Latimer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Darsie Latimer!\' said Mr. Geddes, hastily; \'do you know anything of\r\nDarsie Latimer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Maybe I do, and maybe I do not,\' answered Peter; \'I am no free to\r\nanswer every body\'s interrogatory, unless it is put judicially, and by\r\nform of law--specially where folk think so much of a caup of sour yill,\r\nor a thimblefu\' of brandy. But as for this gentleman, that has shown\r\nhimself a gentleman at breakfast, and will show himself a gentleman at\r\nthe meridian, I am free to condescend upon any points in the cause that\r\nmay appear to bear upon the question at issue.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, all I want to know from you, my friend, is, whether you are\r\nseeking to do this Mr. Alan Fairford good or harm; because if you come\r\nto do him good, I think you could maybe get speech of him--and if to do\r\nhim harm, I will take the liberty to give you a cast across the Firth,\r\nwith fair warning not to come back on such an errand, lest worse come of\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\nThe manner and language of Ewart were such that Joshua Geddes resolved\r\nto keep cautious silence, till he could more plainly discover whether he\r\nwas likely to aid or impede him in his researches after Darsie Latimer.\r\nHe therefore determined to listen attentively to what should pass\r\nbetween Peter and the seaman, and to watch for an opportunity of\r\nquestioning the former, so soon as he should be separated from his new\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n\'I wad by no means,\' said Peter Peebles, \'do any substantial harm to the\r\npoor lad Fairford, who has had mony a gowd guinea of mine, as weel as\r\nhis father before him; but I wad hae him brought back to the minding of\r\nmy business and his ain; and maybe I wadna insist further in my action\r\nof damages against him, than for refunding the fees, and for some annual\r\nrent on the principal sum due frae the day on which he should have\r\nrecovered it for me, plack and bawbee, at the great advising; for ye\r\nare aware, that is the least that I can ask NOMINE DAMNI; and I have nae\r\nthought to break down the lad bodily a\'thegither--we maun live and let\r\nlive--forgie and forget.\'\r\n\r\n\'The deuce take me, friend Broadbrim,\' said Nanty Ewart, looking to the\r\nQuaker, \'if I can make out what this old scarecrow means. If I thought\r\nit was fitting that Master Fairford should see him, why perhaps it is\r\na matter that could be managed. Do you know anything about the old\r\nfellow?--you seemed to take some charge of him just now.\'\r\n\r\n\'No more than I should have done by any one in distress,\' said Geddes,\r\nnot sorry to be appealed to; \'but I will try what I can do to find out\r\nwho he is, and what he is about in this country. But are we not a little\r\ntoo public in this open room?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s well thought of,\' said Nanty; and at his command the barmaid\r\nushered the party into a side-booth, Peter attending them in the\r\ninstinctive hope that there would be more liquor drunk among them before\r\nparting. They had scarce sat down in their new apartment, when the sound\r\nof a violin was heard in the room which they had just left.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll awa back yonder,\' said Peter, rising up again; \'yon\'s the sound of\r\na fiddle, and when there is music, there\'s ay something ganging to eat\r\nor drink.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am just going to order something here,\' said the Quaker; \'but in the\r\nmeantime, have you any objection, my good friend, to tell us your name?\'\r\n\r\n\'None in the world, if you are wanting to drink to me by name and\r\nsurname,\' answered Peebles; \'but, otherwise, I would rather evite your\r\ninterrogatories.\'\r\n\r\n\'Friend,\' said the Quaker, \'it is not for thine own health, seeing thou\r\nhast drunk enough already--however--here, handmaiden--bring me a gill of\r\nsherry.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sherry\'s but shilpit drink, and a gill\'s a sma\' measure for twa\r\ngentlemen to crack ower at their first acquaintance. But let us see your\r\nsneaking gill of sherry,\' said Poor Peter, thrusting forth his huge\r\nhand to seize on the diminutive pewter measure, which, according to the\r\nfashion of the time, contained the generous liquor freshly drawn from\r\nthe butt.\r\n\r\n\'Nay, hold, friend,\' said Joshua, \'thou hast not yet told me what name\r\nand surname I am to call thee by.\'\r\n\r\n\'D--d sly in the Quaker,\' said Nanty, apart, \'to make him pay for his\r\nliquor before he gives it him. Now, I am such a fool, that I should have\r\nlet him get too drunk to open his mouth, before I thought of asking him\r\na question.\'\r\n\r\n\'My name is Peter Peebles, then,\' said the litigant, rather sulkily,\r\nas one who thought his liquor too sparingly meted out to him; \'and what\r\nhave you to say to that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Peter Peebles?\' repeated Nanty Ewart and seemed to muse upon something\r\nwhich the words brought to his remembrance, while the Quaker pursued his\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\'But I prithee, Peter Peebles, what is thy further designation? Thou\r\nknowest, in our country, that some men are distinguished by their craft\r\nand calling, as cordwainers, fishers, weavers, or the like, and some by\r\ntheir titles as proprietors of land (which savours of vanity)--now, how\r\nmay you be distinguished from others of the same name?\'\r\n\r\n\'As Peter Peebles of the great plea of Poor Peter Peebles against\r\nPlainstanes, ET PER CONTRA--if I am laird of naething else, I am ay a\r\nDOMINUS LITIS.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s but a poor lairdship, I doubt,\' said Joshua.\r\n\r\n\'Pray, Mr. Peebles,\' said Nanty, interrupting the conversation abruptly,\r\n\'were not you once a burgess of Edinburgh?\'\r\n\r\n\'WAS I a burgess!\' said Peter indignantly, \'and AM I not a burgess even\r\nnow? I have done nothing to forfeit my right, I trow--once provost and\r\nay my lord.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mr. Burgess, tell me further, have you not some property in the\r\nGude Town?\' continued Ewart.\r\n\r\n\'Troth have I--that is, before my misfortunes, I had twa or three bonny\r\nbits of mailings amang the closes and wynds, forby the shop and the\r\nstory abune it. But Plainstanes has put me to the causeway now. Never\r\nmind though, I will be upsides with him yet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Had not you once a tenement in the Covenant Close?\' again demanded\r\nNanty.\r\n\r\n\'You have hit it, lad, though ye look not like a Covenanter,\' said\r\nPeter; \'we\'ll drink to its memory--(Hout! the heart\'s at the mouth o\'\r\nthat ill-faur\'d bit stoup already!)--it brought a rent, reckoning from\r\nthe crawstep to the groundsill, that ye might ca\' fourteen punds a year,\r\nforby the laigh cellar that was let to Lucky Littleworth.\'\r\n\r\n\'And do you not remember that you had a poor old lady for your tenant,\r\nMrs. Cantrips of Kittlebasket?\' said Nanty, suppressing his emotion with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\'Remember! G--d, I have gude cause to remember her,\' said Peter, \'for\r\nshe turned a dyvour on my hands, the auld besom! and after a\' that the\r\nlaw could do to make me satisfied and paid, in the way of poinding and\r\ndistrenzieing and sae forth, as the law will, she ran awa to the charity\r\nworkhouse, a matter of twenty punds Scots in my debt--it\'s a great shame\r\nand oppression that charity workhouse, taking in bankrupt dyvours that\r\ncanna, pay their honest creditors.\'\r\n\r\n\'Methinks, friend,\' said the Quaker, \'thine own rags might teach thee\r\ncompassion for other people\'s nakedness.\'\r\n\r\n\'Rags!\' said Peter, taking Joshua\'s words literally; \'does ony wise body\r\nput on their best coat when they are travelling, and keeping company\r\nwith Quakers, and such other cattle as the road affords?\'\r\n\r\n\'The old lady DIED, I have heard,\' said Nanty, affecting a moderation\r\nwhich was belied by accents that faltered with passion.\r\n\r\n\'She might live or die, for what I care,\' answered Peter the Cruel;\r\n\'what business have folk to do to live that canna live as law will, and\r\nsatisfy their just and lawful creditors?\'\r\n\r\n\'And you--you that are now yourself trodden down in the very kennel,\r\nare you not sorry for what you have done? Do you not repent having\r\noccasioned the poor widow woman\'s death?\'\r\n\r\n\'What for should I repent?\' said Peter; \'the law was on my side--a\r\ndecreet of the bailies, followed by poinding, and an act of warding--a\r\nsuspension intented, and the letters found orderly proceeded. I followed\r\nthe auld rudas through twa courts--she cost me mair money than her lugs\r\nwere worth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, by Heaven!\' said Nanty, \'I would give a thousand guineas, if I had\r\nthem, to have you worth my beating! Had you said you repented, it had\r\nbeen between God and your conscience; but to hear you boast of your\r\nvillany--Do you think it little to have reduced the aged to famine, and\r\nthe young to infamy--to have caused the death of one woman, the ruin of\r\nanother, and to have driven a man to exile and despair? By Him that made\r\nme, I can scarce keep hands off you!\r\n\r\n\'Off me? I defy ye!\' said Peter. \'I take this honest man to witness that\r\nif ye stir the neck of my collar, I will have my action for stouthreif,\r\nspulzie, oppression, assault and battery. Here\'s a bra\' din, indeed,\r\nabout an auld wife gaun to the grave, a young limmer to the close-heads\r\nand causeway, and a sticket stibbler [A student of divinity who has not\r\nbeen able to complete his studies on theology.] to the sea instead of\r\nthe gallows!\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, by my soul,\' said Nanty, \'this is too much! and since you can feel\r\nno otherwise, I will try if I cannot beat some humanity into your head\r\nand shoulders.\'\r\n\r\nHe drew his hanger as he spoke, and although Joshua, who had in vain\r\nendeavoured to interrupt the dialogue to which he foresaw a violent\r\ntermination, now threw himself between Nanty and the old litigant, he\r\ncould not prevent the latter from receiving two or three sound slaps\r\nover the shoulder with the flat side of the weapon.\r\n\r\nPoor Peter Peebles, as inglorious in his extremity as he had been\r\npresumptuous in bringing it on, now ran and roared, and bolted out of\r\nthe apartment and house itself, pursued by Nanty, whose passion became\r\nhigh in proportion to his giving way to its dictates, and by Joshua, who\r\nstill interfered at every risk, calling upon Nanty to reflect on the\r\nage and miserable circumstances of the offender, and upon Poor Peter\r\nto stand and place himself under his protection. In front of the house,\r\nhowever, Peter Peebles found a more efficient protector than the worthy\r\nQuaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD\r\n\r\nOur readers may recollect that Fairford had been conducted by Dick\r\nGardener from the house of Fairladies to the inn of old Father\r\nCrackenthorp, in order, as he had been informed by the mysterious Father\r\nBuonaventure, that he might have the meeting which he desired with Mr.\r\nRedgauntlet, to treat with him for the liberty of his friend Darsie. His\r\nguide, by the special direction of Mr. Ambrose, had introduced him into\r\nthe public-house by a back-door, and recommended to the landlord to\r\naccommodate him with a private apartment, and to treat him with all\r\ncivility; but in other respects to keep his eye on him, and even to\r\nsecure his person, if he saw any reason to suspect him to be a spy. He\r\nwas not, however, subjected to any direct restraint, but was ushered\r\ninto an apartment where he was requested to await the arrival of\r\nthe gentleman with whom he wished to have an interview, and who, as\r\nCrackenthorp assured, him with a significant nod, would be certainly\r\nthere in the course of an hour. In the meanwhile, he recommended to him,\r\nwith another significant sign, to keep his apartment, \'as there were\r\npeople in the house who were apt to busy themselves about other folk\'s\r\nmatters.\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford complied with the recommendation, so long as he thought\r\nit reasonable; but when, among a large party riding up to the house, he\r\ndiscerned Redgauntlet, whom he had seen under the name of Mr. Herries\r\nof Birrenswork, and whom, by his height and strength, he easily\r\ndistinguished from the rest, he thought it proper to go down to the\r\nfront of the house, in hopes that, by more closely reconnoitring the\r\nparty, he might discover if his friend Darsie was among them.\r\n\r\nThe reader is aware that, by doing so, he had an opportunity of breaking\r\nDarsie\'s fall from his side-saddle, although his disguise and mask\r\nprevented his recognizing his friend. It may be also recollected that\r\nwhile Nixon hurried Miss Redgauntlet and her brother into the house,\r\ntheir uncle, somewhat chafed at an unexpected and inconvenient\r\ninterruption, remained himself in parley with Fairford, who had already\r\nsuccessively addressed him by the names of Herries and Redgauntlet;\r\nneither of which, any more than the acquaintance of the young lawyer,\r\nhe seemed at the moment willing to acknowledge, though an air of haughty\r\nindifference, which he assumed, could not conceal his vexation and\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n\'If we must needs be acquainted, sir,\' he said at last--\'for which I\r\nam unable to see any necessity, especially as I am now particularly\r\ndisposed to be private--I must entreat you will tell me at once what you\r\nhave to say, and permit me to attend to matters of more importance.\'\r\n\r\n\'My introduction,\' said Fairford, \'is contained in this\r\nletter.--(Delivering that of Maxwell.)--I am convinced that, under\r\nwhatever name it may be your pleasure for the present to be known, it is\r\ninto your hands, and yours only, that it should be delivered.\'\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet turned the letter in his hand--then read the contents then\r\nagain looked upon the letter, and sternly observed, \'The seal of the\r\nletter has been broken. Was this the case, sir, when it was delivered\r\ninto your hand?\'\r\n\r\nFairford despised a falsehood as much as any man,--unless, perhaps, as\r\nTom Turnpenny might have said, \'in the way of business.\' He answered\r\nreadily and firmly, \'The seal was whole when the letter was delivered to\r\nme by Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees.\'\r\n\r\n\'And did you dare, sir, to break the seal of a letter addressed to me?\'\r\nsaid Redgauntlet, not sorry, perhaps, to pick a quarrel upon a point\r\nforeign to the tenor of the epistle.\r\n\r\n\'I have never broken the seal of any letter committed to my charge,\'\r\nsaid Alan; \'not from fear of those to whom such letter might be\r\naddressed, but from respect to myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is well worded,\' said Redgauntlet; \'and yet, young Mr. Counsellor,\r\nI doubt whether your delicacy prevented your reading my letter, or\r\nlistening to the contents as read by some other person after it was\r\nopened.\'\r\n\r\n\'I certainly did hear the contents read over,\' said Fairford; \'and they\r\nwere such as to surprise me a good deal.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now that,\' said Redgauntlet, \'I hold to be pretty much the same, IN\r\nFORO CONSCIENTIAE, as if you had broken the seal yourself. I shall hold\r\nmyself excused from entering upon further discourse with a messenger\r\nso faithless; and you may thank yourself if your journey has been\r\nfruitless.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stay, sir,\' said Fairford; \'and know that I became acquainted with the\r\ncontents of the paper without my consent--I may even say, against my\r\nwill; for Mr. Buonaventure\'--\r\n\r\n\'Who?\' demanded Redgauntlet, in a wild and alarmed manner--\'WHOM was it\r\nyou named?\'\r\n\r\n\'Father Buonaventure,\' said Alan,--\'a Catholic priest, as I apprehend,\r\nwhom I saw at the Misses Arthuret\'s house, called Fairladies.\'\r\n\r\n\'Misses Arthuret!--Fairladies!--A Catholic priest!--Father\r\nBuonaventure!\' said Redgauntlet, repeating the words of Alan with\r\nastonishment.--\'Is it possible that human rashness can reach such a\r\npoint of infatuation? Tell me the truth, I conjure you, sir. I have\r\nthe deepest interest to know whether this is more than an idle legend,\r\npicked up from hearsay about the country. You are a lawyer, and know the\r\nrisk incurred by the Catholic clergy, whom the discharge of their duty\r\nsends to these bloody shores.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am a lawyer, certainly,\' said Fairford; \'but my holding such a\r\nrespectable condition in life warrants that I am neither an informer\r\nnor a spy. Here is sufficient evidence that I have seen Father\r\nBuonaventure.\'\r\n\r\nHe put Buonaventure\'s letter into Redgauntlet\'s hand, and watched his\r\nlooks closely while he read it. \'Double-dyed infatuation!\' he muttered,\r\nwith looks in which sorrow, displeasure, and anxiety were mingled.\r\n\'"Save me from the indiscretion of my friends," says the Spaniard; "I\r\ncan save myself from the hostility of my enemies."\'\r\n\r\nHe then read the letter attentively, and for two or three minutes\r\nwas lost in thought, while some purpose of importance seemed to have\r\ngathered and sit brooding upon his countenance. He held up his finger\r\ntowards his satellite, Cristal Nixon, who replied to his signal with a\r\nprompt nod; and with one or two of the attendants approached Fairford in\r\nsuch a manner as to make him apprehensive they were about to lay hold of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a noise was heard from withinside of the house, and\r\npresently rushed forth Peter Peebles, pursued by Nanty Ewart with his\r\ndrawn hanger, and the worthy Quaker, who was endeavouring to prevent\r\nmischief to others, at some risk of bringing it on himself.\r\n\r\nA wilder and yet a more absurd figure can hardly be imagined, than that\r\nof Poor Peter clattering along as fast as his huge boots would permit\r\nhim, and resembling nothing so much as a flying scarecrow; while the\r\nthin emaciated form of Nanty Ewart, with the hue of death on his cheek,\r\nand the fire of vengeance glancing from his eye, formed a ghastly\r\ncontrast with the ridiculous object of his pursuit.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet threw himself between them. \'What extravagant folly is\r\nthis?\' he said. \'Put up your weapon, captain. Is this a time to indulge\r\nin drunken brawls, or is such a miserable object as that a fitting\r\nantagonist for a man of courage?\'\r\n\r\n\'I beg pardon,\' said the captain, sheathing his weapon--\'I was a little\r\nbit out of the way, to be sure; but to know the provocation, a man must\r\nread my heart, and that I hardly dare to do myself. But the wretch is\r\nsafe from me. Heaven has done its own vengeance on us both.\'\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke in this manner, Peter Peebles, who had at first crept\r\nbehind Redgauntlet in bodily fear, began now to reassume his spirits.\r\nPulling his protector by the sleeve, \'Mr. Herries--Mr. Herries,\' he\r\nwhispered, eagerly, \'ye have done me mair than ae gude turn, and if ye\r\nwill but do me anither at this dead pinch, I\'ll forgie the girded keg of\r\nbrandy that you and Captain Sir Harry Redgimlet drank out yon time. Ye\r\nsall hae an ample discharge and renunciation, and, though I should see\r\nyou walking at the Cross of Edinburgh, or standing at the bar of the\r\nCourt of Justiciary, no the very thumbikins themselves should bring to\r\nmy memory that ever I saw you in arms yon day.\'\r\n\r\nHe accompanied this promise by pulling so hard at Redgauntlet\'s cloak,\r\nthat he at last turned round. \'Idiot! speak in a word what you want.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aweel, aweel. In a word, then,\' said Peter Peebles, \'I have a warrant\r\non me to apprehend that man that stands there, Alan Fairford by name,\r\nand advocate by calling. I bought it from Maister Justice Foxley\'s\r\nclerk, Maister Nicholas Faggot, wi\' the guinea that you gied me.\r\n\r\n\'Ha!\' said Redgauntlet, \'hast thou really such a warrant? let me see it.\r\nLook sharp that no one escape, Cristal Nixon.\'\r\n\r\nPeter produced a huge, greasy, leathern pocketbook, too dirty to\r\npermit its original colour to be visible, filled with scrolls of notes,\r\nmemorials to counsel, and Heaven knows what besides. From amongst this\r\nprecious mass he culled forth a paper, and placed it in the hands of\r\nRedgauntlet, or Herries, as he continued to call him, saying, at the\r\nsame time, \'It\'s a formal and binding warrant, proceeding on my affidavy\r\nmade, that the said Alan Fairford, being lawfully engaged in my service,\r\nhad slipped the tether and fled over the Border, and was now lurking\r\nthere and thereabouts, to elude and evite the discharge of his bounden\r\nduty to me; and therefore granting warrant to constables and others,\r\nto seek for, take, and apprehend him, that he may be brought before\r\nthe Honourable Justice Foxley for examination, and, if necessary, for\r\ncommitment. Now, though a\' this be fairly set down, as I tell ye, yet\r\nwhere am I to get an officer to execute this warrant in sic a country as\r\nthis, where swords and pistols flee out at a word\'s speaking, and folk\r\ncare as little for the peace of King George as the peace of Auld King\r\nCoul? There\'s that drunken skipper, and that wet Quaker, enticed me into\r\nthe public this morning, and because I wadna gie them\' as much brandy as\r\nwad have made them blind-drunk, they baith fell on me, and were in the\r\nway of guiding me very ill.\'\r\n\r\nWhile Peter went on in this manner, Redgauntlet glanced his eye over the\r\nwarrant, and immediately saw that it must be a trick passed by Nicholas\r\nFaggot, to cheat the poor insane wretch out of his solitary guinea. But\r\nthe Justice had actually subscribed it, as he did whatever his clerk\r\npresented to him, and Redgauntlet resolved to use it for his own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nWithout making any direct answer, therefore, to Peter Peebles, he walked\r\nup gravely to Fairford, who had waited quietly for the termination of\r\na scene in which he was not a little surprised to find his client, Mr.\r\nPeebles, a conspicuous actor.\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Fairford,\' said Redgauntlet, \'there are many reasons which might\r\ninduce me to comply with the request, or rather the injunctions, of the\r\nexcellent Father Buonaventure, that I should communicate with you upon\r\nthe present condition of my ward, whom you know under the name of\r\nDarsie Latimer; but no man is better aware than you that the law must be\r\nobeyed, even in contradiction to our own feelings; now this poor man\r\nhas obtained a warrant for carrying you before a magistrate, and, I am\r\nafraid, there is a necessity of your yielding to it, although to the\r\npostponement of the business which you may have with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'A warrant against me!\' said Alan, indignantly; \'and at that poor\r\nmiserable wretch\'s instance?--why, this is a trick, a mere and most\r\npalpable trick.\'\r\n\r\n\'It may be so,\' replied Redgauntlet, with great equanimity; \'doubtless\r\nyou know best; only the writ appears regular, and with that respect\r\nfor the law which has been,\' he said, with hypocritical formality, \'a\r\nleading feature of my character through life, I cannot dispense with\r\ngiving my poor aid to the support of a legal warrant. Look at it\r\nyourself, and be satisfied it is no trick of mine.\'\r\n\r\nFairford ran over the affidavit and the warrant, and then exclaimed once\r\nmore, that it was an impudent imposition, and that he would hold those\r\nwho acted upon such a warrant liable in the highest damages. \'I guess\r\nat your motive, Mr. Redgauntlet,\' he said, \'for acquiescing in so\r\nridiculous a proceeding. But be assured you will find that, in this\r\ncountry, one act of illegal violence will not be covered or atoned for\r\nby practising another. You cannot, as a man of sense and honour, pretend\r\nto say you regard this as a legal warrant.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am no lawyer, sir,\' said Redgauntlet; \'and pretend not to know what\r\nis or is not law--the warrant is quite formal, and that is enough for\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did ever any one hear,\' said Fairford, \'of an advocate being compelled\r\nto return to his task, like a collier or a salter [See Note 10.] who has\r\ndeserted his master?\'\r\n\r\n\'I see no reason why he should not,\' said Redgauntlet, dryly, \'unless\r\non the ground that the services of the lawyer are the most expensive and\r\nleast useful of the two.\'\r\n\r\n\'You cannot mean this in earnest,\' said Fairford; \'you cannot really\r\nmean to avail yourself of so poor a contrivance, to evade the word\r\npledged by your friend, your ghostly father, in my behalf. I may have\r\nbeen a fool for trusting it too easily, but think what you must be if\r\nyou can abuse my confidence in this manner. I entreat you to reflect\r\nthat this usage releases me from all promises of secrecy or connivance\r\nat what I am apt to think are very dangerous practices, and that\'--\r\n\r\n\'Hark ye, Mr. Fairford,\' said Redgauntlet; \'I must here interrupt you\r\nfor your own sake. One word of betraying what you may have seen, or what\r\nyou may have suspected, and your seclusion is like to have either a very\r\ndistant or a very brief termination; in either case a most undesirable\r\none. At present, you are sure of being at liberty in a very few\r\ndays--perhaps much sooner.\'\r\n\r\n\'And my friend,\' said Alan Fairford, \'for whose sake I have run myself\r\ninto this danger, what is to become of him? Dark and dangerous man!\' he\r\nexclaimed, raising his voice, I will not be again cajoled by deceitful\r\npromises\'--\r\n\r\n\'I give you my honour that your friend is well,\' interrupted\r\nRedgauntlet; \'perhaps I may permit you to see him, if you will but\r\nsubmit with patience to a fate which is inevitable.\'\r\n\r\nBut Alan Fairford, considering his confidence as having been abused,\r\nfirst by Maxwell, and next by the priest, raised his voice, and appealed\r\nto all the king\'s lieges within hearing, against the violence with\r\nwhich he was threatened. He was instantly seized on by Nixon and two\r\nassistants, who, holding down his arms, and endeavouring to stop his\r\nmouth, were about to hurry him away.\r\n\r\nThe honest Quaker, who had kept out of Redgauntlet\'s presence, now came\r\nboldly forward.\r\n\r\n\'Friend,\' said he, \'thou dost more than thou canst answer. Thou knowest\r\nme well, and thou art aware that in me thou hast a deeply injured\r\nneighbour, who was dwelling beside thee in the honesty and simplicity of\r\nhis heart.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tush, Jonathan,\' said Redgauntlet; \'talk not to me, man; it is neither\r\nthe craft of a young lawyer, nor the SIMPLICITY of an old hypocrite, can\r\ndrive me from my purpose.\r\n\r\n\'By my faith,\' said the captain, coming forward in his turn, \'this is\r\nhardly fair, general; and I doubt,\' he added, \'whether the will of my\r\nowners can make me a party to such proceedings. Nay, never fumble with\r\nyour sword-hilt, but out with it like a man, if you are for a tilting.\'\r\nHe unsheathed his hanger, and continued--\'I will neither see my comrade\r\nFairford, nor the old Quaker, abused. D----n all warrants, false or\r\ntrue--curse the justice--confound the constable!--and here stands little\r\nNanty Ewart to make good what he says against gentle and simple, in\r\nspite of horse-shoe or horse-radish either.\'\r\n\r\nThe cry of \'Down with all warrants!\' was popular in the ears of the\r\nmilitia of the inn, and Nanty Ewart was no less so. Fishers, ostlers,\r\nseamen, smugglers, began to crowd to the spot. Crackenthorp endeavoured\r\nin vain to mediate. The attendants of Redgauntlet began to handle their\r\nfirearms; but their master shouted to them to forbear, and, unsheathing\r\nhis sword as quick as lightning, he rushed on Ewart in the midst of\r\nhis bravado, and struck his weapon from his hand with such address and\r\nforce, that it flew three yards from him. Closing with him at the same\r\nmoment, he gave him a severe fall, and waved his sword over his head, to\r\nshow he was absolutely at his mercy.\r\n\r\n\'There, you drunken vagabond,\' he said, \'I give you your life--you are\r\nno bad fellow if you could keep from brawling among your friends. But\r\nwe all know Nanty Ewart,\' he said to the crowd around, with a forgiving\r\nlaugh, which, joined to the awe his prowess had inspired, entirely\r\nconfirmed their wavering allegiance.\r\n\r\nThey shouted, \'The laird for ever!\' while poor Nanty, rising from the\r\nearth, on whose lap he had been stretched so rudely, went in quest of\r\nhis hanger, lifted it, wiped it, and, as he returned the weapon to the\r\nscabbard, muttered between his teeth, \'It is true they say of him, and\r\nthe devil will stand his friend till his hour come; I will cross him no\r\nmore.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he slunk from the crowd, cowed and disheartened by his\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n\'For you, Joshua Geddes,\' said Redgauntlet, approaching the Quaker, who,\r\nwith lifted hands and eyes, had beheld the scene of violence, \'l shall\r\ntake the liberty to arrest thee for a breach of the peace, altogether\r\nunbecoming thy pretended principles; and I believe it will go hard with\r\nthee both in a court of justice and among thine own Society of Friends,\r\nas they call themselves, who will be but indifferently pleased to\r\nsee the quiet tenor of their hypocrisy insulted by such violent\r\nproceedings.\'\r\n\r\n\'I violent!\' said Joshua; \'I do aught unbecoming the principles of the\r\nFriends! I defy thee, man, and I charge thee, as a Christian, to forbear\r\nvexing my soul with such charges: it is grievous enough to me to have\r\nseen violences which I was unable to prevent.\'\r\n\r\n\'O Joshua, Joshua!\' said Redgauntlet, with a sardonic smile; \'thou light\r\nof the faithful in the town of Dumfries and the places adjacent, wilt\r\nthou thus fall away from the truth? Hast thou not, before us all,\r\nattempted to rescue a man from the warrant of law? Didst thou not\r\nencourage that drunken fellow to draw his weapon--and didst thou not\r\nthyself flourish thy cudgel in the cause? Think\'st thou that the oaths\r\nof the injured Peter Peebles, and the conscientious Cristal Nixon,\r\nbesides those of such gentlemen as look on this strange scene, who not\r\nonly put on swearing as a garment, but to whom, in Custom House matters,\r\noaths are literally meat and drink,--dost thou not think, I say, that\r\nthese men\'s oaths will go further than thy Yea and Nay in this matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will swear to anything,\' said Peter. \'All is fair when it comes to an\r\noath AD LITEM.\'\r\n\r\n\'You do me foul wrong,\' said the Quaker, undismayed by the general\r\nlaugh. \'I encouraged no drawing of weapons, though I attempted to move\r\nan unjust man by some use of argument--I brandished no cudgel, although\r\nit may be that the ancient Adam struggled within me, and caused my hand\r\nto grasp mine oaken staff firmer than usual, when I saw innocence borne\r\ndown with violence. But why talk I what is true and just to thee, who\r\nhast been a man of violence from thy youth upwards? Let me rather speak\r\nto thee such language as thou canst comprehend. Deliver these young men\r\nup to me,\' he said, when he had led Redgauntlet a little apart from the\r\ncrowd, \'and I will not only free thee from the heavy charge of damages\r\nwhich thou hast incurred by thine outrage upon my property, but I will\r\nadd ransom for them and for myself. What would it profit thee to do the\r\nyouths wrong, by detaining them in captivity?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Geddes,\' said Redgauntlet, in a tone more respectful than he had\r\nhitherto used to the Quaker, \'your language is disinterested, and I\r\nrespect the fidelity of your friendship. Perhaps we have mistaken each\r\nother\'s principles and motives; but if so, we have not at present time\r\nfor explanation. Make yourself easy. I hope to raise your friend\r\nDarsie Latimer to a pitch of eminence which you will witness with\r\npleasure;--nay, do not attempt to answer me. The other young man shall\r\nsuffer restraint a few days, probably only a few hours,--it is not more\r\nthan due for his pragmatical interference in what concerned him not.\r\nDo you, Mr. Geddes, be so prudent as to take your horse and leave this\r\nplace, which is growing every moment more unfit for the abode of a man\r\nof peace. You may wait the event in safety at Mount Sharon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Friend,\' replied Joshua, \'I cannot comply with thy advice; I will\r\nremain here, even as thy prisoner, as thou didst but now threaten,\r\nrather than leave the youth who hath suffered by and through me and my\r\nmisfortunes, in his present state of doubtful safety. Wherefore I will\r\nnot mount my steed Solomon; neither will I turn his head towards Mount\r\nSharon, until I see an end of this matter.\'\r\n\r\n\'A prisoner, then, you must be,\' said Redgauntlet. \'I have no time to\r\ndispute the matter further with you. But tell me for what you fix your\r\neyes so attentively on yonder people of mine.\'\r\n\r\n\'To speak the truth,\' said the Quaker, \'I admire to behold among them\r\na little wretch of a boy called Benjie, to whom I think Satan has given\r\nthe power of transporting himself wheresoever mischief is going forward;\r\nso that it may be truly said, there is no evil in this land wherein he\r\nhath not a finger, if not a whole hand.\'\r\n\r\nThe boy, who saw their eyes fixed on him as they spoke, seemed\r\nembarrassed, slid rather desirous of making his escape; but at a signal\r\nfrom Redgauntlet he advanced, assuming the sheepish look and rustic\r\nmanner with which the jackanapes covered much acuteness and roguery.\r\n\r\n\'How long have you been with the party, sirrah?\' said Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\n\'Since the raid on the stake-nets,\' said Benjie, with his finger in his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\'And what made you follow us?\'\r\n\r\n\'I dauredna stay at hame for the constables,\' replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\'And what have you been doing all this time?\'\r\n\r\n\'Doing, sir? I dinna ken what ye ca\' doing--I have been doing naething,\'\r\nsaid Benjie; then seeing something in Redgauntlet\'s eye which was not\r\nto be trifled with, he added, \'Naething but waiting on Maister Cristal\r\nNixon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hum!--aye--indeed?\' muttered Redgauntlet. \'Must Master Nixon bring his\r\nown retinue into the field? This must be seen to.\'\r\n\r\nHe was about to pursue his inquiry, when Nixon himself came to him with\r\nlooks of anxious haste, \'The Father is come,\' he whispered, \'and the\r\ngentlemen are getting together in the largest room of the house, and\r\nthey desire to see you. Yonder is your nephew, too, making a noise like\r\na man in Bedlam.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will look to it all instantly,\' said Redgauntlet. \'Is the Father\r\nlodged as I directed?\'\r\n\r\nCristal nodded.\r\n\r\n\'Now, then, for the final trial,\' said Redgauntlet. He folded his\r\nhands--looked upwards--crossed himself--and after this act of devotion\r\n(almost the first which any one had observed him make use of) he\r\ncommanded Nixon to keep good watch--have his horses and men ready for\r\nevery emergence--look after the safe custody of the prisoners--but treat\r\nthem at the same time well and civilly. And, these orders given, he\r\ndarted hastily into the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE CONTINUED\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet\'s first course was to the chamber of his nephew. He unlocked\r\nthe door, entered the apartment, and asked what he wanted, that he made\r\nso much noise.\r\n\r\n\'I want my liberty,\' said Darsie, who had wrought himself up to a pitch\r\nof passion in which his uncle\'s wrath had lost its terrors. \'I desire\r\nmy liberty, and to be assured of the safety of my beloved friend, Alan\r\nFairford, whose voice I heard but now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your liberty shall be your own within half an hour from this\r\nperiod--your friend shall be also set at freedom in due time--and you\r\nyourself be permitted to have access to his place of confinement.\'\r\n\r\n\'This does not satisfy me,\' said Darsie; \'I must see my friend\r\ninstantly; he is here, and he is here endangered on my account only--I\r\nhave heard violent exclamations--the clash of swords. You will gain no\r\npoint with me unless I have ocular demonstration of his safety.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arthur--dearest nephew,\' answered Redgauntlet, \'drive me not mad! Thine\r\nown fate--that of thy house--that of thousands--that of Britain herself,\r\nare at this moment in the scales; and you are only occupied about the\r\nsafety of a poor insignificant pettifogger!\'\r\n\r\n\'He has sustained injury at your hands, then?\' said Darsie, fiercely. \'I\r\nknow he has; but if so, not even our relationship shall protect you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Peace, ungrateful and obstinate fool!\' said Redgauntlet. Yet\r\nstay--will you be satisfied if you see this Alan Fairford, the bundle\r\nof bombazine--this precious friend of yours--well and sound? Will you,\r\nI say, be satisfied with seeing him in perfect safety without attempting\r\nto speak to or converse with him?\' Darsie signified his assent. \'Take\r\nhold of my arm, then,\' said Redgauntlet; \'and do you, niece Lilias, take\r\nthe other; and beware; Sir Arthur, how you bear yourself.\'\r\n\r\nDarsie was compelled to acquiesce, sufficiently aware that his uncle\r\nwould permit him no interview with a friend whose influence would\r\ncertainly be used against his present earnest wishes, and in some\r\nmeasure contented with the assurance of Fairford\'s personal safety.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet led them through one or two passages (for the house, as\r\nwe have before said, was very irregular, and built at different times)\r\nuntil they entered an apartment, where a man with shouldered carabine\r\nkept watch at the door, but readily turned the key for their reception.\r\nIn this room they found Alan Fairford and the Quaker, apparently in\r\ndeep conversation with each other. They looked up as Redgauntlet and\r\nhis party entered; and Alan pulled off his hat and made a profound\r\nreverence, which the young lady, who recognized him,--though, masked\r\nas she was, he could not know her,--returned with some embarrassment,\r\narising probably from the recollection of the bold step she had taken in\r\nvisiting him.\r\n\r\nDarsie longed to speak, but dared not. His uncle only said, \'Gentlemen,\r\nI know you are as anxious on Mr. Darsie Latimer\'s account as he is upon\r\nyours. I am commissioned by him to inform you, that he is as well as you\r\nare--I trust you will all meet soon. Meantime, although I cannot suffer\r\nyou to be at large, you shall be as well treated as is possible under\r\nyour temporary confinement.\'\r\n\r\nHe passed on, without pausing to hear the answers which the lawyer and\r\nthe Quaker were hastening to prefer; and only waving his hand by way\r\nof adieu, made his exit, with the real and the seeming lady whom he\r\nhad under his charge, through a door at the upper end of the apartment,\r\nwhich was fastened and guarded like that by which they entered.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet next led the way into a very small room; adjoining which,\r\nbut divided by a partition, was one of apparently larger dimensions; for\r\nthey heard the trampling of the heavy boots of the period, as if several\r\npersons were walking to and fro and conversing in low and anxious\r\nwhispers.\r\n\r\n\'Here,\' said Redgauntlet to his nephew, as he disencumbered him from\r\nthe riding-skirt and the mask, \'I restore you to yourself, and trust you\r\nwill lay aside all effeminate thoughts with this feminine dress. Do\r\nnot blush at having worn a disguise to which kings and heroes have been\r\nreduced. It is when female craft or female cowardice find their way\r\ninto a manly bosom, that he who entertains these sentiments should take\r\neternal shame to himself for thus having resembled womankind. Follow me,\r\nwhile Lilias remains here. I will introduce you to those whom I hope to\r\nsee associated with you in the most glorious cause that hand ever drew\r\nsword in.\'\r\n\r\nDarsie paused. \'Uncle,\' he said, \'my person is in your hands; but\r\nremember, my will is my own. I will not be hurried into any resolution\r\nof importance. Remember what I have already said--what I now\r\nrepeat--that I will take no step of importance but upon conviction.\'\r\n\r\n\'But canst thou be convinced, thou foolish boy, without hearing and\r\nunderstanding the grounds on which we act?\'\r\n\r\nSo saying he took Darsie by the arm, and walked with him to the next\r\nroom--a large apartment, partly filled with miscellaneous articles of\r\ncommerce, chiefly connected with contraband trade; where, among bales\r\nand barrels, sat, or walked to and fro, several gentlemen, whose manners\r\nand looks seemed superior to the plain riding dresses which they wore.\r\n\r\nThere was a grave and stern anxiety upon their countenances, when, on\r\nRedgauntlet\'s entrance, they drew from their separate coteries into one\r\ngroup around him, and saluted him with a formality which had something\r\nin it of ominous melancholy. As Darsie looked around the circle, he\r\nthought he could discern in it few traces of that adventurous hope which\r\nurges men upon desperate enterprises; and began to believe that the\r\nconspiracy would dissolve of itself, without the necessity of his\r\nplacing himself in direct opposition to so violent a character as his\r\nuncle, and incurring the hazard with which such opposition must be\r\nattended.\r\n\r\nMr. Redgauntlet, however, did not, or would not, see any such marks of\r\ndepression of spirit amongst his coadjutors, but met them with cheerful\r\ncountenance, and a warm greeting of welcome. \'Happy to meet you here,\r\nmy lord,\' he said, bowing low to a slender young man. \'I trust you\r\ncome with the pledges of your noble father, of B--, and all that loyal\r\nhouse.--Sir Richard, what news in the west? I am told you had two\r\nhundred men on foot to have joined when the fatal retreat from Derby was\r\ncommenced. When the White Standard is again displayed, it shall not\r\nbe turned back so easily, either by the force of its enemies, or the\r\nfalsehood of its friends.--Doctor Grumball, I bow to the representative\r\nof Oxford, the mother of learning and loyalty.--Pengwinion, you\r\nCornish chough, has this good wind blown you north?--Ah, my brave\r\nCambro-Britons, when was Wales last in the race of honour?\'\r\n\r\nSuch and such-like compliments he dealt around, which were in general\r\nanswered by silent bows; but when he saluted one of his own countrymen\r\nby the name of MacKellar, and greeted Maxwell of Summertrees by that\r\nof Pate-in-Peril, the latter replied, \'that if Pate were not a fool,\r\nhe would be Pate-in-Safety;\' and the former, a thin old gentle-man, in\r\ntarnished embroidery, said bluntly, \'Aye, troth, Redgauntlet, I am here\r\njust like yourself; I have little to lose--they that took my land the\r\nlast time, may take my life this; and that is all I care about it.\'\r\n\r\nThe English gentlemen, who were still in possession of their paternal\r\nestates, looked doubtfully on each other, and there was something\r\nwhispered among them of the fox which had lost his tail.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet hastened to address them. \'I think, my lords and gentlemen,\'\r\nhe said, \'that I can account for something like sadness which has crept\r\nupon an assembly gathered together for so noble a purpose. Our numbers\r\nseem, when thus assembled, too small and inconsiderable to shake the\r\nfirm-seated usurpation of a half-century. But do not count us by what\r\nwe are in thew and muscle, but by what our summons can do among our\r\ncountrymen. In this small party are those who have power to raise\r\nbattalions, and those who have wealth to pay them. And do not believe\r\nour friends who are absent are cold or indifferent to the cause. Let us\r\nonce light the signal, and it will be hailed by all who retain love for\r\nthe Stuart, and by all--a more numerous body--who hate the Elector. Here\r\nI have letters from\'--\r\n\r\nSir Richard Glendale interrupted the speaker. \'We all confide,\r\nRedgauntlet, in your valour and skill--we admire your perseverance; and\r\nprobably nothing short of your strenuous exertions, and the emulation\r\nawakened by your noble and disinterested conduct, could have brought\r\nso many of us, the scattered remnant of a disheartened party, to meet\r\ntogether once again in solemn consultation; for I take it, gentlemen,\'\r\nhe said, looking round, \'this is only a consultation.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing more,\' said the young lord.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing more,\' said Doctor Grumball, shaking his large academical\r\nperuke.\r\n\r\nAnd, \'Only a consultation,\' was echoed by the others.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet bit his lip. \'I had hopes,\' he said, \'that the discourses\r\nI have held with most of you, from time to time, had ripened into more\r\nmaturity than your words imply, and that we were here to execute as\r\nwell as to deliberate; and for this we stand prepared. I can raise five\r\nhundred men with my whistle.\'\r\n\r\n\'Five hundred men!\' said one of the Welsh squires; \'Cot bless us! and\r\npray you, what cood could five hundred men do?\'\r\n\r\n\'All that the priming does for the cannon, Mr. Meredith,\' answered\r\nRedgauntlet; \'it will enable us to seize Carlisle, and you know what our\r\nfriends have engaged for in that case.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes--but,\' said the young nobleman, \'you must not hurry us on too fast,\r\nMr. Redgauntlet; we are all, I believe, as sincere and truehearted in\r\nthis business as you are, but we will not be driven forward blindfold.\r\nWe owe caution to ourselves and our families, as well as to those whom\r\nwe are empowered to represent on this occasion.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who hurries you, my lord? Who is it that would drive this meeting\r\nforward blindfold? I do not understand your lordship,\' said Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' said Sir Richard Glendale, \'at least do not let us fall under\r\nour old reproach of disagreeing among ourselves. What my lord means,\r\nRedgauntlet, is, that we have this morning heard it is uncertain\r\nwhether you could even bring that body of men whom you count upon; your\r\ncountryman, Mr. MacKellar, seemed, just before you came in, to doubt\r\nwhether your people would rise in any force, unless you could produce\r\nthe authority of your nephew.\'\r\n\r\n\'I might ask,\' said Redgauntlet,\' what right MacKellar, or any one, has\r\nto doubt my being able to accomplish what I stand pledged for? But our\r\nhopes consist in our unity. Here stands my nephew. Gentlemen, I present\r\nto you my kinsman, Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet of that Ilk.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gentlemen,\' said Darsie, with a throbbing bosom, for he felt the crisis\r\na very painful one, \'Allow me to say, that I suspend expressing my\r\nsentiments on the important subject under discussion until I have heard\r\nthose of the present meeting.\'\r\n\r\n\'Proceed in your deliberations, gentlemen,\' said Redgauntlet; \'I will\r\nshow my nephew such reasons for acquiescing in the result, as will\r\nentirely remove any scruples which may hang around his mind.\'\r\n\r\nDr. Grumball now coughed, \'shook his ambrosial curls,\' and addressed the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\n\'The principles of Oxford,\' he said,\' are well understood, since she\r\nwas the last to resign herself to the Arch-Usurper,--since she has\r\ncondemned, by her sovereign authority, the blasphemous, atheistical,\r\nand anarchical tenets of Locke, and other deluders of the public\r\nmind. Oxford will give men, money and countenance, to the cause of the\r\nrightful monarch. But we have, been often deluded by foreign powers,\r\nwho have availed themselves of our zeal to stir up civil dissensions, in\r\nBritain, not for the advantage of our blessed though banished monarch,\r\nbut to stir up disturbances by which they might profit, while we, their\r\ntools, are sure to be ruined. Oxford, therefore, will not rise, unless\r\nour sovereign comes in person to claim our allegiance, in which case,\r\nGod forbid we should refuse him our best obedience.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a very cood advice,\' said Mr. Meredith.\r\n\r\n\'In troth,\' said Sir Richard Glendale, \'it is the very keystone of our\r\nenterprise, and the only condition upon which I myself and others\r\ncould ever have dreamt of taking up arms. No insurrection which has not\r\nCharles Edward himself at its head, will, ever last longer than till a\r\nsingle foot company of redcoats march to disperse it.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is my own opinion, and that of all my family,\' said the young\r\nnobleman already mentioned; \'and I own I am somewhat surprised at being\r\nsummoned to attend a dangerous rendezvous such as this, before something\r\ncertain could have been stated to us on this most important preliminary\r\npoint.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pardon me, my lord,\' said Redgauntlet; \'I have not been so unjust\r\neither to myself or my friends--I had no means of communicating to our\r\ndistant confederates (without the greatest risk of discovery) what is\r\nknown to some of my honourable friends. As courageous, and as resolved,\r\nas when, twenty years since, he threw himself into the wilds of Moidart,\r\nCharles Edward has instantly complied with the wishes of his faithful\r\nsubjects. Charles Edward is in this country--Charles Edward is in this\r\nhouse!--Charles Edward waits but your present decision, to receive the\r\nhomage of those who have ever called themselves his loyal liegemen. He\r\nthat would now turn his coat, and change his note, must do so under the\r\neye of his sovereign.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a deep pause. Those among the conspirators whom mere habit, or\r\na desire of preserving consistency, had engaged in the affair, now saw\r\nwith terror their retreat cut off; and others, who at a distance had\r\nregarded the proposed enterprise as hopeful, trembled when the moment\r\nof actually embarking in it was thus unexpectedly and almost inevitably\r\nprecipitated.\r\n\r\n\'How now, my lords and gentlemen!\' said Redgauntlet; is it delight and\r\nrapture that keep you thus silent? where are the eager welcomes that\r\nshould be paid to your rightful king, who a second time confides his\r\nperson to the care of his subjects, undeterred by the hairbreadth\r\nescapes and severe privations of his former expedition? I hope there is\r\nno gentleman here that is not ready to redeem, in his prince\'s presence,\r\nthe pledge of fidelity which he offered in his absence.\'\r\n\r\n\'I, at least,\' said the young nobleman resolutely, and laying his hand\r\non his sword, \'will not be that coward. If Charles is come to these\r\nshores, I will be the first to give him welcome, and to devote my life\r\nand fortune to his service.\'\r\n\r\n\'Before Cot,\' said Mr. Meredith, \'I do not see that Mr. Redgauntlet has\r\nleft us anything else to do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stay,\' said Summertrees, \'there is yet one other question. Has he\r\nbrought any of those Irish rapparees with him, who broke the neck of our\r\nlast glorious affair?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a man of them,\' said Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\n\'I trust,\' said Dr. Grumball, \'that there are no Catholic priests in his\r\ncompany. I would not intrude on the private conscience of my sovereign,\r\nbut, as an unworthy son of the Church of England, it is my duty to\r\nconsider her security.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a Popish dog or cat is there, to bark or mew about his Majesty,\'\r\nsaid Redgauntlet. \'Old Shaftesbury himself could not wish a prince\'s\r\nperson more secure from Popery--which may not be the worst religion\r\nin the world, notwithstanding. Any more doubts, gentlemen? can no more\r\nplausible reasons be discovered for postponing the payment of our duty,\r\nand discharge of our oaths and engagements? Meantime your king waits\r\nyour declaration--by my faith he hath but a frozen reception!\'\r\n\r\n\'Redgauntlet,\' said Sir Richard Glendale, calmly, \'your reproaches shall\r\nnot goad me into anything of which my reason disapproves. That I respect\r\nmy engagement as much as you do, is evident, since I am here, ready to\r\nsupport it with the best blood in my veins. But has the king really come\r\nhither entirely unattended?\'\r\n\r\n\'He has no man with him but young ------, as aide de camp, and a single\r\nvalet de chambre.\'\r\n\r\n\'No MAN--but, Redgauntlet, as you are a gentleman, has he no woman with\r\nhim?\'\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet cast his eyes on the ground and replied, \'I am sorry to\r\nsay--he has.\'\r\n\r\nThe company looked at each other, and remained silent for a moment.\r\nAt length Sir Richard proceeded. \'I need not repeat to you, Mr.\r\nRedgauntlet, what is the well-grounded opinion of his Majesty\'s friends\r\nconcerning that most unhappy connexion there is but one sense and\r\nfeeling amongst us upon the subject. I must conclude that our humble\r\nremonstrances were communicated by you, sir, to the king?\'\r\n\r\n\'In the same strong terms in which they were couched,\' replied\r\nRedgauntlet. \'I love his Majesty\'s cause more than I fear his\r\ndispleasure.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, apparently, our humble expostulation has produced no effect.\r\nThis lady, who has crept into his bosom, has a sister in the Elector\r\nof Hanover\'s court, and yet we are well assured that our most private\r\ncommunication is placed in her keeping.\'\r\n\r\n\'VARIUM ET MUTABILE SEMPER FEMINA,\' said Dr. Grumball.\r\n\r\n\'She puts his secrets into her work-bag,\' said Maxwell; \'and out they\r\nfly whenever she opens it. If I must hang, I would wish it to be in\r\nsomewhat a better rope than the string of a lady\'s hussey.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you, too, turning dastard, Maxwell?\' said Redgauntlet, in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\'Not I,\' said Maxwell; \'let us fight for it, and let them win and wear\r\nus; but to be betrayed by a brimstone like that\'--\r\n\r\n\'Be temperate, gentlemen,\' said Redgauntlet; \'the foible of which you\r\ncomplain so heavily has always been that of kings and heroes; which I\r\nfeel strongly confident the king will surmount, upon the humble entreaty\r\nof his best servants, and when he sees them ready to peril their all in\r\nhis cause, upon the slight condition of his resigning the society of\r\na female favourite, of whom I have seen reason to think he hath been\r\nhimself for some time wearied. But let us not press upon him rashly\r\nwith our well-meant zeal. He has a princely will as becomes his princely\r\nbirth, and we, gentlemen, who are royalists, should be the last to take\r\nadvantage of circumstances to limit its exercise. I am as much surprised\r\nand hurt as you can be, to find that he has made her the companion of\r\nthis journey, increasing every chance of treachery and detection. But do\r\nnot let us insist upon a sacrifice so humiliating, while he has scarce\r\nplaced a foot upon the beach of his kingdom. Let us act generously by\r\nour sovereign; and when we have shown what we will do for him, we\r\nshall be able, with better face, to state what it is we expect him to\r\nconcede.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, I think it is but a pity,\' said MacKellar, \'when so many pretty\r\ngentlemen are got together, that they should part without the flash of a\r\nsword among them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should be of that gentleman\'s opinion,\' said Lord ------, \'had I\r\nnothing to lose but my life; but I frankly own, that the conditions\r\non which our family agreed to join having been, in this instance, left\r\nunfulfilled, I will not peril the whole fortunes of our house on the\r\ndoubtful fidelity of an artful woman.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry to see your lordship,\' said Redgauntlet, \'take a course\r\nwhich is more likely to secure your house\'s wealth than to augment its\r\nhonours.\'\r\n\r\n\'How am I to understand your language, sir?\' said the young nobleman,\r\nhaughtily.\r\n\r\n\'Nay, gentlemen,\' said Dr Grumball, interposing, \'do not let friends\r\nquarrel; we are all zealous for the cause--but truly, although I know\r\nthe license claimed by the great in such matters, and can, I hope, make\r\ndue allowance, there is, I may say, an indecorum in a prince who comes\r\nto claim the allegiance of the Church of England, arriving on such an\r\nerrand with such a companion--SI NON CASTE, CAUTE TAMEN.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder how the Church of England came to be so heartily attached to\r\nhis merry old namesake,\' said Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Glendale then took up the question, as one whose authority\r\nand experience gave him right to speak with much weight.\r\n\r\n\'We have no leisure for hesitation,\' he said; \'it is full time that\r\nwe decide what course we are to hold. I feel as much as you, Mr.\r\nRedgauntlet, the delicacy of capitulating with our sovereign in his\r\npresent condition. But I must also think of the total ruin of the\r\ncause, the confiscation and bloodshed which will take place among his\r\nadherents, and all through the infatuation with which he adheres to\r\na woman who is the pensionary of the present minister, as she was\r\nfor years Sir Robert Walpole\'s. Let his Majesty send her back to the\r\ncontinent, and the sword on which I now lay my hand shall instantly be\r\nunsheathed, and, I trust, many hundred others at the same moment.\'\r\n\r\nThe other persons present testified their unanimous acquiescence in what\r\nSir Richard Glendale had said.\r\n\r\n\'I see you have taken your resolutions, gentlemen,\' said Redgauntlet;\r\n\'unwisely I think, because I believe that, by softer and more generous\r\nproceedings, you would have been more likely to carry a point which I\r\nthink as desirable as you do. But what is to be done if Charles should\r\nrefuse, with the inflexibility of his grandfather, to comply with this\r\nrequest of yours? Do you mean to abandon him to his fate?\'\r\n\r\n\'God forbid!\' said Sir Richard, hastily; \'and God forgive you, Mr.\r\nRedgauntlet, for breathing such a thought. No! I for one will, with all\r\nduty and humility, see him safe back to his vessel, and defend him with\r\nmy life against whosoever shall assail him. But when I have seen his\r\nsails spread, my next act will be to secure, if I can, my own safety, by\r\nretiring to my house; or, if I find our engagement, as is too probable,\r\nhas taken wind, by surrendering myself to the next Justice of Peace,\r\nand giving security that hereafter I shall live quiet, and submit to the\r\nruling powers.\'\r\n\r\nAgain the rest of the persons present intimated their agreement in\r\nopinion with the speaker.\r\n\r\n\'Well, gentlemen,\' said Redgauntlet, \'it is not for me to oppose the\r\nopinion of every one; and I must do you the justice to say, that\r\nthe king has, in the present instance, neglected a condition of your\r\nagreement which was laid before him in very distinct terms. The question\r\nnow is, who is to acquaint him with the result of this conference; for I\r\npresume you would not wait on him in a body to make the proposal that\r\nhe should dismiss a person from his family as the price of your\r\nallegiance.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think Mr. Redgauntlet should make the explanation, said Lord--. \'As\r\nhe has, doubtless, done justice to our remonstrances by communicating\r\nthem to the king, no one can, with such propriety and force, state the\r\nnatural and inevitable consequence of their being neglected.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, I think,\' said Redgauntlet, \'that those who make the objection\r\nshould state it, for I am confident the king will hardly believe, on\r\nless authority than that of the heir of the loyal House of B--, that he\r\nis the first to seek an evasion of his pledge to join him.\'\r\n\r\n\'An evasion, sir!\' repeated Lord ------, fiercely, \'I have borne too\r\nmuch from you already, and this I will not endure. Favour me with your\r\ncompany to the downs.\'\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet laughed scornfully, and was about to follow the fiery young\r\nman, when Sir Richard again interposed. \'Are we to exhibit,\' he said,\r\n\'the last symptoms of the dissolution of our party, by turning our\r\nswords against each other? Be patient, Lord ------; in such conferences\r\nas this, much must pass unquestioned which might brook challenge\r\nelsewhere. There is a privilege of party as of parliament--men cannot,\r\nin emergency, stand upon picking phrases. Gentlemen, if you will extend\r\nyour confidence in me so far, I will wait upon his Majesty, and I\r\nhope my Lord ------ and Mr. Redgauntlet will accompany me. I trust the\r\nexplanation of this unpleasant matter will prove entirely satisfactory,\r\nand that we shall find ourselves at liberty to render our homage to our\r\nsovereign without reserve, when I for one will be the first to peril all\r\nin his just quarrel.\'\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet at once stepped forward. \'My lord,\' he said, \'if my zeal\r\nmade me say anything in the slightest degree offensive, I wish it\r\nunsaid, and ask your pardon. A gentleman can do no more.\'\r\n\r\n\'I could not have asked Mr. Redgauntlet to do so much,\' said the young\r\nnobleman, willingly accepting the hand which Redgauntlet offered. \'I\r\nknow no man living from whom I could take so much reproof without a\r\nsense of degradation as from himself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me then hope, my lord, that you will go with Sir Richard and me to\r\nthe presence. Your warm blood will heat our zeal--our colder resolves\r\nwill temper yours.\r\n\r\nThe young lord smiled, and shook his head. \'Alas! Mr. Redgauntlet,\' he\r\nsaid, \'I am ashamed to say, that in zeal you surpass us all. But I\r\nwill not refuse this mission, provided you will permit Sir Arthur, your\r\nnephew, also to accompany us.\'\r\n\r\n\'My nephew?\' said Redgauntlet, and seemed to hesitate, then added, \'Most\r\ncertainly. I trust,\' he said, looking at Darsie, \'he will bring to his\r\nprince\'s presence such sentiments as fit the occasion.\'\r\n\r\nIt seemed however to Darsie, that his uncle would rather have left\r\nhim behind, had he not feared that he might in that case have been\r\ninfluenced by, or might perhaps himself influence, the unresolved\r\nconfederates with whom he must have associated during his absence.\r\n\r\n\'I will go,\' said Redgauntlet, \'and request admission.\'\r\n\r\nIn a moment after he returned, and without speaking, motioned for the\r\nyoung nobleman to advance. He did so, followed by Sir Richard Glendale\r\nand Darsie, Redgauntlet himself bringing up the rear. A short\r\npassage, and a few steps, brought them to the door of the temporary\r\npresence-chamber, in which the Royal Wanderer was to receive their\r\nhomage. It was the upper loft of one of those cottages which made\r\nadditions to the old inn, poorly furnished, dusty, and in disorder; for,\r\nrash as the enterprise might be considered, they had been still careful\r\nnot to draw the attention of strangers by any particular attentions\r\nto the personal accommodation of the prince. He was seated, when the\r\ndeputies, as they might be termed, of his remaining adherents entered;\r\nand as he rose, and came forward and bowed, in acceptance of their\r\nsalutation, it was with a dignified courtesy which at once supplied\r\nwhatever was deficient in external pomp, and converted the wretched\r\ngarret into a saloon worthy of the occasion.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that he was the same personage already introduced\r\nin the character of Father Buonaventure, by which name he was\r\ndistinguished at Fairladies. His dress was not different from what he\r\nthen wore, excepting that he had a loose riding-coat of camlet, under\r\nwhich he carried an efficient cut-and-thrust sword, instead of his\r\nwalking rapier, and also a pair of pistols.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet presented to him successively the young Lord ------, and\r\nhis kinsman, Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet, who trembled as, bowing\r\nand kissing his hand, he found himself surprised into what might be\r\nconstrued an act of high treason, which yet he saw no safe means to\r\navoid.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Glendale seemed personally known to Charles Edward, who\r\nreceived him with a mixture of dignity and affection, and seemed to\r\nsympathize with the tears which rushed into that gentleman\'s eyes as he\r\nbade his Majesty welcome to his native kingdom.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, my good Sir Richard,\' said the unfortunate prince in a tone\r\nmelancholy, yet resolved, \'Charles Edward is with his faithful friends\r\nonce more--not, perhaps, with his former gay hopes which undervalued\r\ndanger, but with the same determined contempt of the worst which can\r\nbefall him, in claiming his own rights and those of his country.\'\r\n\r\n\'I rejoice, sire--and yet, alas! I must also grieve, to see you once\r\nmore on the British shores,\' said Sir Richard Glendale, and stopped\r\nshort--a tumult of contradictory feelings preventing his further\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\n\'It is the call of my faithful and suffering people which alone could\r\nhave induced me to take once more the sword in my hand. For my own part,\r\nSir Richard, when I have reflected how many of my loyal and devoted\r\nfriends perished by the sword and by proscription, or died indigent\r\nand neglected in a foreign land, I have often, sworn that no view to my\r\npersonal aggrandizement should again induce me to agitate a title which\r\nhas cost my followers so dear. But since so many men of worth and honour\r\nconceive the cause of England and Scotland to be linked with that of\r\nCharles Stuart, I must follow their brave example, and, laying aside all\r\nother considerations, once more stand forward as their deliverer. I am,\r\nhowever, come hither upon your invitation; and as you are so completely\r\nacquainted with circumstances to which my absence must necessarily\r\nhave rendered me a stranger, I must be a mere tool in the hands of my\r\nfriends. I know well I never can refer myself implicitly to more\r\nloyal hearts or wiser heads, than Herries Redgauntlet, and Sir Richard\r\nGlendale. Give me your advice, then, how we are to proceed, and decide\r\nupon the fate of Charles Edward.\'\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet looked at Sir Richard, as if to say, \'Can you press any\r\nadditional or unpleasant condition at a moment like this?\' And the other\r\nshook his head and looked down, as if his resolution was unaltered, and\r\nyet as feeling all the delicacy of the situation.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, which was broken by the unfortunate representative\r\nof an unhappy dynasty, with some appearance of irritation. \'This is\r\nstrange, gentlemen,\' he said; \'you have sent for me from the bosom of my\r\nfamily, to head an adventure of doubt and danger; and when I come, your\r\nown minds seem to be still irresolute. I had not expected this on the\r\npart of two such men.\'\r\n\r\n\'For me, sire,\' said Redgauntlet, \'the steel of my sword is not truer\r\nthan the temper of my mind.\'\r\n\r\n\'My Lord ------\'s and mine are equally so,\' said Sir Richard; \'but you\r\nhad in charge, Mr. Redgauntlet, to convey our request to his Majesty,\r\ncoupled with certain conditions.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I discharged my duty to his Majesty and to you,\' said Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\n\'I looked at no condition, gentlemen,\' said their king, with dignity,\'\r\nsave that which called me here to assert my rights in person. That I\r\nhave fulfilled at no common risk. Here I stand to keep my word, and I\r\nexpect of you to be true to yours.\'\r\n\r\n\'There was, or should have been, something more than that in our\r\nproposal, please your Majesty,\' said Sir Richard. \'There was a condition\r\nannexed to it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw it not,\' said Charles, interrupting him. \'Out of tenderness\r\ntowards the noble hearts of whom I think so highly, I would neither\r\nsee nor read anything which could lessen them in my love and my esteem.\r\nConditions can have no part betwixt prince and subject.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sire,\' said Redgauntlet, kneeling on one knee, \'I see from Sir\r\nRichard\'s countenance he deems it my fault that your Majesty seems\r\nignorant of what your subjects desired that I should communicate to your\r\nMajesty. For Heaven\'s sake! for the sake of all my past services and\r\nsufferings, leave not such a stain upon my honour! The note, Number D,\r\nof which this is a copy, referred to the painful subject to which Sir\r\nRichard again directs your attention.\'\r\n\r\n\'You press upon me, gentlemen,\' said the prince, colouring highly,\'\r\nrecollections, which, as I hold them most alien to your character, I\r\nwould willingly have banished from my memory. I did not suppose that\r\nmy loyal subjects would think so poorly of me, as to use my depressed\r\ncircumstances as a reason for forcing themselves into my domestic\r\nprivacies, and stipulating arrangements with their king regarding\r\nmatters in which the meanest minds claim the privilege of thinking for\r\nthemselves. In affairs of state and public policy, I will ever be guided\r\nas becomes a prince, by the advice of my wisest counsellors; in those\r\nwhich regard my private affections and my domestic arrangements, I claim\r\nthe same freedom of will which I allow to all my subjects, and without\r\nwhich a crown were less worth wearing than a beggar\'s bonnet.\'\r\n\r\n\'May it please your Majesty,\' said Sir Richard Glendale, \'I see it must\r\nbe my lot to speak unwilling truths; but believe me, I do so with as\r\nmuch profound respect as deep regret. It is true, we have called you to\r\nhead a mighty undertaking, and that your Majesty, preferring honour to\r\nsafety, and the love of your country to your own ease, has condescended\r\nto become our leader. But we also pointed out as a necessary and\r\nindispensable preparatory step to the achievement of our purpose--and,\r\nI must say, as a positive condition of our engaging in it--that an\r\nindividual, supposed,--I presume not to guess how truly,--to have your\r\nMajesty\'s more intimate confidence, and believed, I will not say on\r\nabsolute proof but upon the most pregnant suspicion, to be capable of\r\nbetraying that confidence to the Elector of Hanover, should be removed\r\nfrom your royal household and society.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is too insolent, Sir Richard!\' said Charles Edward. \'Have you\r\ninveigled me into your power to bait me in this unseemly manner? And\r\nyou, Redgauntlet, why did you suffer matters to come to such a point as\r\nthis, without making me more distinctly aware what insults were to be\r\npractised on me?\'\r\n\r\n\'My gracious prince,\' said Redgauntlet, \'I am so far to blame in this,\r\nthat I did not think so slight an impediment as that of a woman\'s\r\nsociety could have really interrupted an undertaking of this magnitude.\r\nI am a plain man, sire, and speak but bluntly; I could not have dreamt\r\nbut what, within the first five minutes of this interview, either Sir\r\nRichard and his friends would have ceased to insist upon a condition so\r\nungrateful to your Majesty, or that your Majesty would have sacrificed\r\nthis unhappy attachment to the sound advice, or even to the over-anxious\r\nsuspicions, of so many faithful subjects. I saw no entanglement in such\r\na difficulty which on either side might not have been broken through\r\nlike a cobweb.\'\r\n\r\n\'You were mistaken, sir,\' said Charles Edward, \'entirely mistaken--as\r\nmuch so as you are at this moment, when you think in your heart my\r\nrefusal to comply with this insolent proposition is dictated by a\r\nchildish and romantic passion for an individual, I tell you, sir, I\r\ncould part with that person to-morrow, without an instant\'s regret--that\r\nI have had thoughts of dismissing her from my court, for reasons known\r\nto myself; but that I will never betray my rights as a sovereign and a\r\nman, by taking this step to secure the favour of any one, or to purchase\r\nthat allegiance which, if you owe it to me at all, is due to me as my\r\nbirthright.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry for this,\' said Redgauntlet; \'I hope both your Majesty\r\nand Sir Richard will reconsider your resolutions, or forbear this\r\ndiscussion, in a conjuncture so pressing. I trust your Majesty will\r\nrecollect that you are on hostile ground; that our preparations cannot\r\nhave so far escaped notice as to permit us now with safety to retreat\r\nfrom our purpose; insomuch, that it is with the deepest anxiety of\r\nheart I foresee even danger to your own royal person, unless you can\r\ngenerously give your subjects the satisfaction, which Sir Richard seems\r\nto think they are obstinate in demanding.\'\r\n\r\n\'And deep indeed your anxiety ought to be,\' said the prince. \'Is it in\r\nthese circumstances of personal danger in which you expect to overcome a\r\nresolution, which is founded on a sense of what is due to me as a man\r\nor a prince? If the axe and scaffold were ready before the windows of\r\nWhitehall, I would rather tread the same path with my great-grandfather,\r\nthan concede the slightest point in which my honour is concerned.\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke these words with a determined accent, and looked around him on\r\nthe company, all of whom (excepting Darsie, who saw, he thought, a\r\nfair period to a most perilous enterprise) seemed in deep anxiety and\r\nconfusion. At length, Sir Richard spoke in a solemn and melancholy tone.\r\n\'If the safety,\' he said, \'of poor Richard Glendale were alone concerned\r\nin this matter, I have never valued my life enough to weigh it\r\nagainst the slightest point of your Majesty\'s service. But I am only a\r\nmessenger--a commissioner, who must execute my trust, and upon whom a\r\nthousand voices will cry, Curse and woe, if I do it not with fidelity.\r\nAll of your adherents, even Redgauntlet himself, see certain ruin to\r\nthis enterprise--the greatest danger to your Majesty\'s person--the utter\r\ndestruction of all your party and friends, if they insist not on the\r\npoint, which, unfortunately, your Majesty is so unwilling to concede. I\r\nspeak it with a heart full of anguish--with a tongue unable to utter\r\nmy emotions--but it must be spoken--the fatal truth--that if your\r\nroyal goodness cannot yield to us a boon which we hold necessary to our\r\nsecurity and your own, your Majesty with one word disarms ten thousand\r\nmen, ready to draw their swords in your behalf; or, to speak yet more\r\nplainly, you annihilate even the semblance of a royal party in Great\r\nBritain.\'\r\n\r\n\'And why do you not add,\' said the prince, scornfully, \'that the men\r\nwho have been ready to assume arms in my behalf, will atone for their\r\ntreason to the Elector, by delivering me up to the fate for which so\r\nmany proclamations have destined me? Carry my head to St. James\'s,\r\ngentlemen; you will do a more acceptable and a more honourable action,\r\nthan, having inveigled me into a situation which places me so completely\r\nin your power, to dishonour yourselves by propositions which dishonour\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\'My God, sire!\' exclaimed Sir Richard, clasping his hands together,\r\nin impatience, \'of what great and inexpiable crime can your Majesty\'s\r\nancestors have \'been guilty, that they have been punished by the\r\ninfliction of judicial blindness on their whole generation!--Come, my\r\nLord ------, we must to our friends.\'\r\n\r\n\'By your leave, Sir Richard,\' said the young nobleman, \'not till we,\r\nhave learned what measures can be taken for his Majesty\'s personal\r\nsafety.\'\r\n\r\n\'Care not for me, young man,\' said Charles Edward; \'when I was in the\r\nsociety of Highland robbers and cattle-drovers, I was safer than I now\r\nhold myself among the representatives of the best blood in England.\r\nFarewell, gentlemen--I will shift for myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'This must never be,\' said Redgauntlet. \'Let me that brought you to the\r\npoint of danger, at least provide for your safe retreat.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he hastily left the apartment, followed by his nephew. The\r\nWanderer, averting his eyes from Lord ------ and Sir Richard Glendale,\r\nthrew himself into a seat at the upper end of the apartment, while they,\r\nin much anxiety, stood together, at a distance from him, and conversed\r\nin whispers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE CONTINUED\r\n\r\nWhen Redgauntlet left the room, in haste and discomposure, the first\r\nperson he met on the stair, and indeed so close by the door of the\r\napartment that Darsie thought he must have been listening there, was his\r\nattendant Nixon.\r\n\r\n\'What the devil do you here?\' he said, abruptly and sternly.\r\n\r\n\'I wait your orders,\' said Nixon. \'I hope all\'s right!--excuse my zeal.\'\r\n\r\n\'All is wrong, sir. Where is the seafaring fellow--Ewart--what do you\r\ncall him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nanty Ewart, sir. I will carry your commands,\' said Nixon.\r\n\r\n\'I will deliver them myself to him,\' said Redgauntlet; call him hither.\'\r\n\r\n\'But should your honour leave the presence?\' said Nixon, still\r\nlingering.\r\n\r\n\'\'Sdeath, sir, do you prate to me?\' said Redgauntlet, bending his brows.\r\n\'I, sir, transact my own business; you, I am told, act by a ragged\r\ndeputy.\'\r\n\r\nWithout further answer, Nixon departed, rather disconcerted, as it\r\nseemed to Darsie.\r\n\r\n\'That dog turns insolent and lazy,\' said Redgauntlet; but I must bear\r\nwith him for a while.\'\r\n\r\nA moment after, Nixon returned with Ewart.\r\n\r\n\'Is this the smuggling fellow?\' demanded Redgauntlet. Nixon nodded.\r\n\r\n\'Is he sober now? he was brawling anon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sober enough for business,\' said Nixon.\r\n\r\n\'Well then, hark ye, Ewart;--man your boat with your best hands, and\r\nhave her by the pier--get your other fellows on board the brig--if you\r\nhave any cargo left, throw it overboard; it shall be all paid, five\r\ntimes over--and be ready for a start to Wales or the Hebrides, or\r\nperhaps for Sweden or Norway.\'\r\n\r\nEwart answered sullenly enough, \'Aye, aye, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go with him, Nixon,\' said Redgauntlet, forcing himself to speak with\r\nsome appearance of cordiality to the servant with whom he was offended;\r\n\'see he does his duty.\'\r\n\r\nEwart left the house sullenly, followed by Nixon. The sailor was just in\r\nthat species of drunken humour which made him jealous, passionate,\r\nand troublesome, without showing any other disorder than that of\r\nirritability. As he walked towards the beach he kept muttering to\r\nhimself, but in such a tone that his companion lost not a word,\r\n\'Smuggling fellow--Aye, smuggler--and, start your cargo into the\r\nsea--and be ready to start for the Hebrides, or Sweden--or the devil,\r\nI suppose. Well, and what if I said in answer--Rebel, Jacobite--traitor;\r\nI\'ll make you and your d----d confederates walk the plank--I have seen\r\nbetter men do it--half a score of a morning--when I was across the\r\nLine.\'\r\n\r\n\'D--d unhandsome terms those Redgauntlet used to you, brother.\' said\r\nNixon.\r\n\r\n\'Which do you mean?\' said Ewart, starting, and recollecting himself. \'I\r\nhave been at my old trade of thinking aloud, have I?\'\r\n\r\n\'No matter,\' answered Nixon, \'none but a friend heard you. You cannot\r\nhave forgotten how Redgauntlet disarmed you this morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I would bear no malice about that--only he is so cursedly high and\r\nsaucy,\' said Ewart.\r\n\r\n\'And then,\' said Nixon,\'I know you for a true-hearted Protestant.\'\r\n\r\n\'That I am, by G--,\' said Ewart. \'No, the Spaniards could never get my\r\nreligion from me.\'\r\n\r\n\'And a friend to King George, and the Hanover line of succession,\' said\r\nNixon, still walking and speaking very slow.\r\n\r\n\'You may swear I am, excepting in the way of business, as Turnpenny\r\nsays. I like King George, but I can\'t afford to pay duties.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are outlawed, I believe,\' said Nixon.\r\n\r\n\'Am I?--faith, I believe I am,\' said Ewart. \'I wish I were INLAWED\r\nagain with all my heart. But come along, we must get all ready for our\r\nperemptory gentleman, I suppose.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will teach you a better trick,\' said Nixon. \'There is a bloody pack\r\nof rebels yonder.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aye, we all know that,\' said the smuggler; \'but the snowball\'s melting,\r\nI think.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is some one yonder, whose head is worth--thirty\r\nthousand--pounds--of sterling money,\' said Nixon, pausing between each\r\nword, as if to enforce the magnificence of the sum.\r\n\r\n\'And what of that?\' said Ewart, quickly.\r\n\r\n\'Only that, instead of lying by the pier with your men on their oars, if\r\nyou will just carry your boat on board just now, and take no notice of\r\nany signal from the shore, by G--d, Nanty Ewart. I will make a man of\r\nyou for life!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh ho! then the Jacobite gentry are not so safe as they think\r\nthemselves?\' said Nanty.\r\n\r\n\'In an hour or two,\' replied Nixon, \'they will be made safer in Carlisle\r\nCastle.\'\r\n\r\n\'The devil they will!\' said Ewart; \'and you have been the informer, I\r\nsuppose?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; I have been ill paid for my service among the Redgauntlets--have\r\nscarce got dog\'s wages--and been treated worse than ever dog was used. I\r\nhave the old fox and his cubs in the same trap now, Nanty; and we\'ll see\r\nhow a certain young lady will look then. You see I am frank with you,\r\nNanty.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I will be as frank with you,\' said the smuggler. \'You are a d--d\r\nold scoundrel--traitor to the man whose bread you eat! Me help to betray\r\npoor devils, that have been so often betrayed myself! Not if they were\r\na hundred Popes, Devils, and Pretenders. I will back and tell them their\r\ndanger--they are part of cargo--regularly invoiced--put under my charge\r\nby the owners--I\'ll back\'--\r\n\r\n\'You are not stark mad?\' said Nixon, who now saw he had miscalculated in\r\nsupposing Nanty\'s wild ideas of honour and fidelity could be shaken\r\neven by resentment, or by his Protestant partialities. \'You shall not go\r\nback--it is all a joke.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll back to Redgauntlet, and see whether it is a joke he will laugh\r\nat.\'\r\n\r\n\'My life is lost if you do,\' said Nixon--\'hear reason.\'\r\n\r\nThey were in a clump or cluster of tall furze at the moment they were\r\nspeaking, about half-way between the pier and the house, but not in a\r\ndirect line, from which Nixon, whose object it was to gain time, had\r\ninduced Ewart to diverge insensibly.\r\n\r\nHe now saw the necessity of taking a desperate resolution. \'Hear\r\nreason,\' he said; and added, as Nanty still endeavoured to pass him, \'Or\r\nelse hear this!\' discharging a pocket-pistol into the unfortunate man\'s\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nNanty staggered, but kept his feet. \'It has cut my back-bone asunder,\'\r\nhe said; \'you have done me the last good office, and I will not die\r\nungrateful.\'\r\n\r\nAs he uttered the last words, he collected his remaining strength, stood\r\nfirm for an instant, drew his hanger, and, fetching a stroke with both\r\nhands, cut Cristal Nixon down. The blow, struck with all the energy of\r\na desperate and dying man, exhibited a force to which Ewart\'s exhausted\r\nframe might have seemed inadequate;--it cleft the hat which the wretch\r\nwore, though secured by a plate of iron within the lining, bit deep into\r\nhis skull, and there left a fragment of the weapon, which was broke by\r\nthe fury of the blow.\r\n\r\nOne of the seamen of the lugger, who strolled up attracted by the firing\r\nof the pistol, though being a small one the report was very trifling,\r\nfound both the unfortunate men stark dead. Alarmed at what he saw,\r\nwhich he conceived to have been the consequence of some unsuccessful\r\nengagement betwixt his late commander and a revenue officer (for Nixon\r\nchanced not to be personally known to him) the sailor hastened back\r\nto the boat, in order to apprise his comrades of Nanty\'s fate, and to\r\nadvise them to take off themselves and the vessel.\r\n\r\nMeantime Redgauntlet, having, as we have seen, dispatched Nixon for the\r\npurpose of securing a retreat for the unfortunate Charles, in case of\r\nextremity, returned to the apartment where he had left the Wanderer. He\r\nnow found him alone.\r\n\r\n\'Sir Richard Glendale,\' said the unfortunate prince, \'with his\r\nyoung friend, has gone to consult their adherents now in the house.\r\nRedgauntlet, my friend, I will not blame you for the circumstances in\r\nwhich I find myself, though I am at once placed in danger, and rendered\r\ncontemptible. But you ought to have stated to me more strongly the\r\nweight which these gentlemen attached to their insolent proposition. You\r\nshould have told me that no compromise would have any effect--that they\r\ndesire not a prince to govern them, but one, on the contrary, over\r\nwhom they were to exercise restraint on all occasions, from the highest\r\naffairs of the state, down to the most intimate and private concerns of\r\nhis own privacy, which the most ordinary men desire to keep secret and\r\nsacred from interference.\'\r\n\r\n\'God knows,\' said Redgauntlet, in much agitation, \'I acted for the best\r\nwhen I pressed your Majesty to come hither--I never thought that your\r\nMajesty, at such a crisis, would have scrupled, when a kingdom was in\r\nview, to sacrifice an attachment, which\'--\r\n\r\n\'Peace, sir!\' said Charles; \'it is not for you to estimate my feelings\r\nupon such a subject.\'\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet coloured high, and bowed profoundly. \'At least,\' he\r\nresumed, \'I hoped that some middle way might be found, and it shall--and\r\nmust.--Come with me, nephew. We will to these gentlemen, and I am\r\nconfident I will bring back heart-stirring tidings.\'\r\n\r\n\'I will do much to comply with them, Redgauntlet. I am loath, having\r\nagain set my foot on British land, to quit it without a blow for my\r\nright. But this which they demand of me is a degradation, and compliance\r\nis impossible.\'\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet, followed by his nephew, the unwilling spectator of this\r\nextraordinary scene, left once more the apartment of the adventurous\r\nWanderer, and was met on the top of the stairs by Joe Crackenthorp.\r\n\'Where are the other gentlemen?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Yonder, in the west barrack,\' answered Joe; \'but Master\r\nIngoldsby,\'--that was the name by which Redgauntlet was most generally\r\nknown in Cumberland,--\'I wish to say to you that I must put yonder folk\r\ntogether in one room.\'\r\n\r\n\'What folk?\' said Redgauntlet, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\'Why, them prisoner stranger folk, as you bid Cristal Nixon look after.\r\nLord love you! this is a large house enow, but we cannot have separate\r\nlock-ups for folk, as they have in Newgate or in Bedlam. Yonder\'s a\r\nmad beggar, that is to be a great man when he wins a lawsuit, Lord help\r\nhim!--Yonder\'s a Quaker and a lawyer charged with a riot; and, ecod, I\r\nmust make one key and one lock keep them, for we are chokeful, and you\r\nhave sent off old Nixon that could have given one some help in this\r\nconfusion. Besides, they take up every one a room, and call for naughts\r\non earth,--excepting the old man, who calls lustily enough,--but he has\r\nnot a penny to pay shot.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do as thou wilt with them,\' said Redgauntlet, who had listened\r\nimpatiently to his statement; \'so thou dost but keep them from getting\r\nout and making some alarm in the country, I care not.\'\r\n\r\n\'A Quaker and a lawyer!\' said Darsie. \'This must be Fairford and\r\nGeddes.--Uncle, I must request of you\'--\r\n\r\n\'Nay, nephew,\' interrupted Redgauntlet, \'this is no time for asking\r\nquestions. You shall yourself decide upon their fate in the course of an\r\nhour--no harm whatever is designed them.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he hurried towards the place where the Jacobite gentlemen\r\nwere holding their council, and Darsie followed him, in the hope that\r\nthe obstacle which had arisen to the prosecution of their desperate\r\nadventure would prove insurmountable and spare him the necessity of a\r\ndangerous and violent rupture with his uncle. The discussions among\r\nthem were very eager; the more daring part of the conspirators, who had\r\nlittle but life to lose, being desirous to proceed at all hazards;\r\nwhile the others, whom a sense of honour and a hesitation to disavow\r\nlong-cherished principles had brought forward, were perhaps not ill\r\nsatisfied to have a fair apology for declining an adventure, into which\r\nthey had entered with more of reluctance than zeal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Joe Crackenthorp, availing himself of the hasty permission\r\nattained from Redgauntlet, proceeded to assemble in one apartment\r\nthose whose safe custody had been thought necessary; and, without much\r\nconsidering the propriety of the matter, he selected for the common\r\nplace of confinement, the room which Lilias had, since her brother\'s\r\ndeparture, occupied alone. It had a strong lock, and was double-hinged,\r\nwhich probably led to the preference assigned to it, as a place of\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nInto this, Joe, with little ceremony, and a good deal of noise,\r\nintroduced the Quaker and Fairford; the first descanting on the\r\nimmorality, the other on the illegality, of his proceedings; and he\r\nturned a deaf ear both to the one and the other. Next he pushed in,\r\nalmost in headlong fashion, the unfortunate litigant, who, having made\r\nsome resistance at the threshold, had received a violent thrust\r\nin consequence, and came rushing forward, like a ram in the act of\r\ncharging, with such impetus as must have carried him to the top of the\r\nroom, and struck the cocked hat which sat perched on the top of his\r\ntow wig against Miss Redgauntlet\'s person, had not the honest Quaker\r\ninterrupted his career by seizing him by the collar, and bringing him to\r\na stand. \'Friend,\' said he, with the real good-breeding which so often\r\nsubsists independently of ceremony, \'thou art no company for that young\r\nperson; she is, thou seest, frightened at our being so suddenly thrust\r\nin hither; and although that be no fault of ours, yet it will become\r\nus to behave civilly towards her. Wherefore come thou with me to this\r\nwindow, and I will tell thee what it concerns thee to know.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what for should I no speak to the Leddy, friend?\' said Peter, who\r\nwas now about half seas over. \'I have spoke to leddies before now, man.\r\nWhat for should she be frightened at me? I am nae bogle, I ween. What\r\nare ye pooin\' me that gate for? Ye will rive my coat, and I will have\r\na good action for having myself made SARTUM ATQUE TECTUM at your\r\nexpenses.\'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this threat, Mr. Geddes, whose muscles were as strong as\r\nhis judgement was sound and his temper sedate, led Poor Peter under the\r\nsense of a control against which he could not struggle, to the farther\r\ncorner of the apartment, where, placing him, whether he would or no, in\r\na chair, he sat down beside him, and effectually prevented his annoying\r\nthe young lady, upon whom he had seemed bent upon conferring the\r\ndelights of his society.\r\n\r\nIf Peter had immediately recognized his counsel learned in the law, it\r\nis probable that not even the benevolent efforts of the Quaker could\r\nhave kept him in a state of restraint; but Fairford\'s back was turned\r\ntowards his client, whose optics, besides being somewhat dazzled with\r\nale and brandy, were speedily engaged in contemplating a half-crown\r\nwhich Joshua held between his finger and his thumb, saying, at the\r\nsame time, \'Friend, thou art indigent and improvident. This will, well\r\nemployed, procure thee sustentation of nature for more than a single\r\nday; and I will bestow it on thee if thou wilt sit here and keep me\r\ncompany; for neither thou nor I, friend, are fit company for ladies.\'\r\n\r\n\'Speak for yourself, friend,\' said Peter, scornfully; \'I was ay kend to\r\nbe agreeable to the fair sex; and when I was in business I served the\r\nladies wi\' anither sort of decorum than Plainstanes, the d--d awkward\r\nscoundrel! It was one of the articles of dittay between us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, but, friend,\' said the Quaker, who observed that the young lady\r\nstill seemed to fear Peter\'s intrusion, \'I wish to hear thee speak about\r\nthis great lawsuit of thine, which has been matter of such celebrity.\'\r\n\r\n\'Celebrity! Ye may swear that,\' said Peter, for the string was touched\r\nto which his crazy imagination always vibrated. \'And I dinna wonder\r\nthat folk that judge things by their outward grandeur, should think me\r\nsomething worth their envying. It\'s very true that it is grandeur upon\r\nearth to hear ane\'s name thunnered out along the long-arched roof of the\r\nOuter House,--"Poor Peter Peebles against Plainstanes ET PER CONTRA;"\r\na\' the best lawyers in the house fleeing like eagles to the prey; some\r\nbecause they are in the cause, and some because they want to be thought\r\nengaged (for there are tricks in other trades by selling muslins)--to\r\nsee the reporters mending their pens to take down the debate--the Lords\r\nthemselves pooin\' in their chairs, like folk sitting down to a gude\r\ndinner, and crying on the clerks for parts and pendicles of the process,\r\nwho, puir bodies, can do little mair than cry on their closet-keepers\r\nto help them. To see a\' this,\' continued Peter, in a tone of sustained\r\nrapture, \'and to ken that naething will be said or dune amang a\' thae\r\ngrand folk, for maybe the feck of three hours, saving what concerns you\r\nand your business--Oh, man, nae wonder that ye judge this to be earthly\r\nglory! And yet, neighbour, as I was saying, there be unco drawbacks--I\r\nwhiles think of my bit house, where dinner, and supper, and breakfast,\r\nused to come without the crying for, just as if fairies had brought\r\nit--and the gude bed at e\'en--and the needfu\' penny in the pouch. And\r\nthen to see a\' ane\'s warldly substance capering in the air in a pair of\r\nweighbauks, now up, now down, as the breath of judge or counsel inclines\r\nit for pursuer or defender,--troth, man, there are times I rue having\r\never begun the plea wark, though, maybe, when ye consider the renown and\r\ncredit I have by it, ye will hardly believe what I am saying.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, friend,\' said Joshua, with a sigh, \'I am glad thou hast found\r\nanything in the legal contention which compensates thee for poverty and\r\nhunger; but I believe, were other human objects of ambition looked\r\nupon as closely, their advantages would be found as chimerical as those\r\nattending thy protracted litigation.\'\r\n\r\n\'But never mind, friend,\' said Peter, \'I\'ll tell you the exact state of\r\nthe conjunct processes, and make you sensible that I can bring mysell\r\nround with a wet finger, now I have my finger and my thumb on this\r\nloup-the-dike loon, the lad Fairford.\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford was in the act of speaking to the masked lady (for Miss\r\nRedgauntlet had retained her riding vizard) endeavouring to assure her,\r\nas he perceived her anxiety, of such protection as he could afford, when\r\nhis own name, pronounced in a loud tone, attracted his attention. He\r\nlooked round, and seeing Peter Peebles, as hastily turned to avoid his\r\nnotice, in which he succeeded, so earnest was Peter upon his colloquy\r\nwith one of the most respectable auditors whose attention he had ever\r\nbeen able to engage. And by this little motion, momentary as it was,\r\nAlan gained an unexpected advantage; for while he looked round, Miss\r\nLilias, I could never ascertain why, took the moment to adjust her mask,\r\nand did it so awkwardly, that when her companion again turned his head,\r\nhe recognized as much of her features as authorized him to address her\r\nas his fair client, and to press his offers of protection and assistance\r\nwith the boldness of a former acquaintance.\r\n\r\nLilias Redgauntlet withdrew the mask from her crimsoned cheek. \'Mr.\r\nFairford,\' she said, in a voice almost inaudible, \'you have the\r\ncharacter of a young gentleman of sense and generosity; but we have\r\nalready met in one situation which you must think singular; and I must\r\nbe exposed to misconstruction, at least, for my forwardness, were it not\r\nin a cause in which my dearest affections were concerned.\'\r\n\r\n\'Any interest in my beloved friend Darsie Latimer,\' said Fairford,\r\nstepping a little back, and putting a marked restraint upon his former\r\nadvances, \'gives me a double right to be useful to\'--He stopped short.\r\n\r\n\'To his sister, your goodness would say,\' answered Lilias.\r\n\r\n\'His sister, madam!\' replied Alan, in the extremity of\r\nastonishment--\'Sister, I presume, in affection only?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, sir; my dear brother Darsie and I are connected by the bonds of\r\nactual relationship; and I am not sorry to be the first to tell this to\r\nthe friend he most values.\'\r\n\r\nFairford\'s first thought was on the violent passion which Darsie had\r\nexpressed towards the fair unknown. \'Good God!\' he exclaimed, \'how did\r\nhe bear the discovery?\'\r\n\r\n\'With resignation, I hope,\' said Lilias, smiling. \'A more accomplished\r\nsister he might easily have come by, but scarcely could have found one\r\nwho could love him more than I do.\'\r\n\r\n\'I meant--I only meant to say,\' said the young counsellor, his presence\r\nof mind failing him for an instant--\'that is, I meant to ask where\r\nDarsie Latimer is at this moment.\'\r\n\r\n\'In this very house, and under the guardianship of his uncle, whom I\r\nbelieve you knew as a visitor of your father, under the name of Mr.\r\nHerries of Birrenswork.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me hasten to him,\' said Fairford; \'I have sought him through\r\ndifficulties and dangers--I must see him instantly.\'\r\n\r\n\'You forget you are a prisoner,\' said the young lady.\r\n\r\n\'True--true; but I cannot be long detained--the cause alleged is too\r\nridiculous.\'\r\n\r\n\'Alas!\' said Lilias, \'our fate--my brother\'s and mine, at least--must\r\nturn on the deliberations perhaps of less than an hour. For you, sir, I\r\nbelieve and apprehend nothing; but some restraint; my uncle is neither\r\ncruel nor unjust, though few will go further in the cause which he has\r\nadopted.\'\r\n\r\n\'Which is that of the Pretend\'--\r\n\r\n\'For God\'s sake speak lower!\' said Lilias, approaching her hand, as if\r\nto stop him. \'The word may cost you your life. You do not know--indeed\r\nyou do not--the terrors of the situation in which we at present stand,\r\nand in which I fear you also are involved by your friendship for my\r\nbrother.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not indeed know the particulars of our situation,\' said Fairford;\r\n\'but, be the danger what it may, I shall not grudge my share of it\r\nfor the sake of my friend; or,\' he added, with more timidity, \'of my\r\nfriend\'s sister. Let me hope,\' he said, \'my dear Miss Latimer, that\r\nmy presence may be of some use to you; and that it may be so, let\r\nme entreat a share of your confidence, which I am conscious I have\r\notherwise no right to ask.\'\r\n\r\nHe led her, as he spoke, towards the recess of the farther window of the\r\nroom, and observing to her that, unhappily, he was particularly exposed\r\nto interruption from the mad old man whose entrance had alarmed her, he\r\ndisposed of Darsie Latimer\'s riding-skirt, which had been left in the\r\napartment, over the back of two chairs, forming thus a sort of screen,\r\nbehind which he ensconced himself with the maiden of the green mantle;\r\nfeeling at the moment, that the danger in which he was placed was almost\r\ncompensated by the intelligence which permitted those feelings towards\r\nher to revive, which justice to his friend had induced him to stifle in\r\nthe birth.\r\n\r\nThe relative situation of adviser and advised, of protector and\r\nprotected, is so peculiarly suited to the respective condition of man\r\nand woman, that great progress towards intimacy is often made in very\r\nshort space; for the circumstances call for confidence on the part of\r\nthe gentleman, and forbid coyness on that of the lady, so that the usual\r\nbarriers against easy intercourse are at once thrown down.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, securing themselves as far as possible from\r\nobservation, conversing in whispers, and seated in a corner, where they\r\nwere brought into so close contact that their faces nearly touched each\r\nother, Fairford heard from Lilias Redgauntlet the history of her family,\r\nparticularly of her uncle; his views upon her brother, and the agony\r\nwhich she felt, lest at that very moment he might succeed in engaging\r\nDarsie in some desperate scheme, fatal to his fortune and perhaps to his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford\'s acute understanding instantly connected what he had\r\nheard with the circumstances he had witnessed at Fairladies. His first\r\nthought was, to attempt, at all risks, his instant escape, and procure\r\nassistance powerful enough to crush, in the very cradle, a conspiracy of\r\nsuch a determined character. This he did not consider as difficult; for,\r\nthough the door was guarded on the outside, the window, which was not\r\nabove ten feet from the ground, was open for escape, the common on which\r\nit looked was unenclosed, and profusely covered with furze. There\r\nwould, he thought, be little difficulty in effecting his liberty, and in\r\nconcealing his course after he had gained it.\r\n\r\nBut Lilias exclaimed against this scheme. Her uncle, she said, was a man\r\nwho, in his moments of enthusiasm, knew neither remorse nor fear. He\r\nwas capable of visiting upon Darsie any injury which he might conceive\r\nFairford had rendered him--he was her near kinsman also, and not an\r\nunkind one, and she deprecated any effort, even in her brother\'s favour,\r\nby which his life must be exposed to danger. Fairford himself remembered\r\nFather Buonaventure, and made little question but that he was one of\r\nthe sons of the old Chevalier de Saint George; and with feelings which,\r\nalthough contradictory of his public duty, can hardly be much censured,\r\nhis heart recoiled from being the agent by whom the last scion of such\r\na long line of Scottish princes should be rooted up. He then thought\r\nof obtaining an audience, if possible, of this devoted person, and\r\nexplaining to him the utter hopelessness of his undertaking, which he\r\njudged it likely that the ardour of his partisans might have concealed\r\nfrom him. But he relinquished this design as soon as formed. He had no\r\ndoubt, that any light which he could throw on the state of the country,\r\nwould come too late to be serviceable to one who was always reported to\r\nhave his own full share of the hereditary obstinacy which had cost his\r\nancestors so dear, and who, in drawing the sword, must have thrown from\r\nhim the scabbard.\r\n\r\nLilias suggested the advice which, of all others, seemed most suited\r\nto the occasion, that, yielding, namely, to the circumstances of their\r\nsituation, they should watch carefully when Darsie should obtain any\r\ndegree of freedom, and endeavour to open a communication with him, in\r\nwhich case their joint flight might be effected, and without endangering\r\nthe safety of any one.\r\n\r\nTheir youthful deliberation had nearly fixed in this point, when\r\nFairford, who was listening to the low sweet whispering tones of Lilias\r\nRedgauntlet, rendered yet more interesting by some slight touch of\r\nforeign accent, was startled by a heavy hand which descended with full\r\nweight on his shoulder, while the discordant voice of Peter Peebles, who\r\nhad at length broke loose from the well-meaning Quaker, exclaimed in the\r\near of his truant counsel--\'Aha, lad! I think ye are catched--An\' so ye\r\nare turned chamber-counsel, are ye? And ye have drawn up wi\' clients\r\nin scarfs and hoods? But bide a wee, billie, and see if I dinna sort ye\r\nwhen my petition and complaint comes to be discussed, with or without\r\nanswers, under certification.\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford had never more difficulty in his life to subdue a first\r\nemotion, than he had to refrain from knocking down the crazy blockhead\r\nwho had broken in upon him at such a moment. But the length of Peter\'s\r\naddress gave him time, fortunately perhaps for both parties, to reflect\r\non the extreme irregularity of such a proceeding. He stood silent,\r\nhowever, with vexation, while Peter went on.\r\n\r\n\'Weel, my bonnie man, I see ye are thinking shame o\' yoursell, and nae\r\ngreat wonder. Ye maun leave this quean--the like of her is ower light\r\ncompany for you. I have heard honest Mr. Pest say, that the gown grees\r\nill wi\' the petticoat. But come awa hame to your puir father, and I\'ll\r\ntake care of you the haill gate, and keep you company, and deil a word\r\nwe will speak about, but just the state of the conjoined processes of\r\nthe great cause of Poor Peter Peebles against Plainstanes.\'\r\n\r\n\'If thou canst; endure to hear as much of that suit, friend,\' said\r\nthe Quaker, \'as I have heard out of mere compassion for thee, I think\r\nverily thou wilt soon be at the bottom of the matter, unless it be\r\naltogether bottomless.\'\r\n\r\nFairford shook off, rather indignantly, the large bony hand which Peter\r\nhad imposed upon his shoulder, and was about to say something peevish,\r\nupon so unpleasant and insolent a mode of interruption, when the door\r\nopened, a treble voice saying to the sentinel, \'I tell you I maun be in,\r\nto see if Mr. Nixon\'s here;\' and little Benjie thrust in his mop-head\r\nand keen black eyes. Ere he could withdraw it, Peter Peebles sprang to\r\nthe door, seized on the boy by the collar, and dragged him forward into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\'Let me see it,\' he said, \'ye ne\'er-do-weel limb of Satan--I\'ll gar\r\nyou satisfy the production, I trow--I\'ll hae first and second diligence\r\nagainst you, ye deevil\'s buckie!\'\r\n\r\n\'What dost thou want?\' said the Quaker, interfering; \'why dost thou\r\nfrighten the boy, friend Peebles?\'\r\n\r\n\'I gave the bastard a penny to buy me snuff,\' said the pauper, \'and he\r\nhas rendered no account of his intromissions; but I\'ll gar him as gude.\'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he proceeded forcibly to rifle the pockets of Benjie\'s ragged\r\njacket of one or two snares for game, marbles, a half-bitten apple, two\r\nstolen eggs (one of which Peter broke in the eagerness of his research),\r\nand various other unconsidered trifles, which had not the air of being\r\nvery honestly come by. The little rascal, under this discipline, bit and\r\nstruggled like a fox-cub, but, like that vermin, uttered neither cry nor\r\ncomplaint, till a note, which Peter tore from his bosom, flew as far as\r\nLilias Redgauntlet, and fell at her feet. It was addressed to C. N.\r\n\r\n\'It is for the villain Nixon.\' she said to Alan Fairford; \'open it\r\nwithout scruple; that boy is his emissary; we shall now see what the\r\nmiscreant is driving at.\'\r\n\r\nLittle Benjie now gave up all further struggle, and suffered Peebles\r\nto take from him, without resistance, a shilling, out of which Peter\r\ndeclared he would pay himself principal and interest, and account for\r\nthe balance. The boy, whose attention seemed fixed on something very\r\ndifferent, only said, \'Maister Nixon will murder me!\'\r\n\r\nAlan Fairford did not hesitate to read the little scrap of paper, on\r\nwhich was written, \'All is prepared--keep them in play until I come up.\r\nYou may depend on your reward.--C. C.\'\r\n\r\n\'Alas, my uncle--my poor uncle!\' said Lilias; \'this is the result of\r\nhis confidence. Methinks, to give him instant notice of his confidant\'s\r\ntreachery, is now the best service we can render all concerned--if\r\nthey break up their undertaking, as they must now do, Darsie will be at\r\nliberty.\'\r\n\r\nIn the same breath, they were both at the half-opened door of the room,\r\nFairford entreating to speak with the Father Buonaventure, and Lilias,\r\nequally vehemently, requesting a moment\'s interview with her uncle.\r\nWhile the sentinel hesitated what to do, his attention was called to a\r\nloud noise at the door, where a crowd had been assembled in consequence\r\nof the appalling cry, that the enemy were upon them, occasioned, as it\r\nafterwards proved, by some stragglers having at length discovered the\r\ndead bodies of Nanty Ewart and of Nixon.\r\n\r\nAmid the confusion occasioned by this alarming incident, the sentinel\r\nceased to attend, to his duty; and accepting Alan Fairford\'s arm, Lilias\r\nfound no opposition in penetrating even to the inner apartment, where\r\nthe principal persons in the enterprise, whose conclave had been\r\ndisturbed by this alarming incident, were now assembled in great\r\nconfusion, and had been joined by the Chevalier himself.\r\n\r\n\'Only a mutiny among these smuggling scoundrels,\' said Redgauntlet.\r\n\r\nONLY a mutiny, do you say?\' said Sir Richard Glendale; \'and the lugger,\r\nthe last hope of escape for,\'--he looked towards Charles,--\'stands out\r\nto sea under a press of sail!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do not concern yourself about me,\' said the unfortunate prince; \'this\r\nis not the worst emergency in which it has been my lot to stand; and if\r\nit were, I fear it not. Shift for yourselves, my lords and gentlemen.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, never!\' said the young Lord ------. \'Our only hope now is in an\r\nhonourable resistance.\'\r\n\r\n\'Most true,\' said Redgauntlet; \'let despair renew the union amongst\r\nus which accident disturbed. I give my voice for displaying the royal\r\nbanner instantly, and--How now!\' he concluded, sternly, as Lilias, first\r\nsoliciting his attention by pulling his cloak, put into his hand the\r\nscroll, and added, it was designed for that of Nixon.\r\n\r\nRedgauntlet read--and, dropping it on the ground, continued to stare\r\nupon the spot where it fell, with raised hands and fixed eyes. Sir\r\nRichard Glendale lifted the fatal paper, read it, and saying, \'Now all\r\nis indeed over,\' handed it to Maxwell, who said aloud, \'Black Colin\r\nCampbell, by G--d! I heard he had come post from London last night.\'\r\n\r\nAs if in echo to his thoughts, the violin of the blind man was heard,\r\nplaying with spirit, The Campbells are coming,\' a celebrated clan-march.\r\n\r\n\'The Campbells are coming in earnest,\' said MacKellar; they are upon us\r\nwith the whole battalion from Carlisle.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a silence of dismay, and two or three of the company began to\r\ndrop out of the room.\r\n\r\nLord ------ spoke with the generous spirit of a young English nobleman.\r\n\'If we have been fools, do not let us be cowards. We have one here more\r\nprecious than us all, and come hither on our warranty--let us save him\r\nat least.\'\r\n\r\n\'True, most true,\' answered Sir Richard Glendale. \'Let the king be first\r\ncared for.\'\r\n\r\n\'That shall be my business,\' said Redgauntlet \'if we have but time to\r\nbring back the brig, all will be well--I will instantly dispatch a party\r\nin a fishing skiff to bring her to.\' He gave his commands to two or\r\nthree of the most active among his followers. \'Let him be once on\r\nboard,\' he said, \'and there are enough of us to stand to arms and cover\r\nhis retreat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right, right,\' said Sir Richard, \'and I will look to points which can\r\nbe made defensible; and the old powder-plot boys could not have made a\r\nmore desperate resistance than we shall. Redgauntlet,\' continued he, \'I\r\nsee some of our friends are looking pale; but methinks your nephew has\r\nmore mettle in his eye now than when we were in cold deliberation, with\r\ndanger at a distance.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is the way of our house,\' said Redgauntlet; \'our courage ever\r\nkindles highest on the losing side. I, too, feel that the catastrophe\r\nI have brought on must not be survived by its author. Let me first,\'\r\nhe said, addressing Charles, \'see your Majesty\'s sacred person in such\r\nsafety as can now be provided for it, and then\'--\r\n\r\n\'You may spare all considerations concerning me, gentlemen,\' again\r\nrepeated Charles; \'yon mountain of Criffel shall fly as soon as I will.\'\r\n\r\nMost threw themselves at his feet with weeping and entreaty; some one\r\nor two slunk in confusion from the apartment, and were heard riding\r\noff. Unnoticed in such a scene, Darsie, his sister, and Fairford, drew\r\ntogether, and held each other by the hands, as those who, when a vessel\r\nis about to founder in the storm, determine to take their chance of life\r\nand death together.\r\n\r\nAmid this scene of confusion, a gentleman, plainly dressed in a\r\nriding-habit, with a black cockade in his hat, but without any arms\r\nexcept a COUTEAU-DE-CHASSE, walked into the apartment without ceremony.\r\nHe was a tall, thin, gentlemanly man, with a look and bearing decidedly\r\nmilitary. He had passed through their guards, if in the confusion they\r\nnow maintained any, without stop or question, and now stood, almost\r\nunarmed, among armed men, who nevertheless, gazed on him as on the angel\r\nof destruction.\r\n\r\n\'You look coldly on me, gentlemen,\' he said. \'Sir Richard Glendale--my\r\nLord ------, we were not always such strangers. Ha, Pate-in-Peril, how\r\nis it with you? and you, too, Ingoldsby--I must not call you by any\r\nother name--why do you receive an old friend so coldly? But you guess my\r\nerrand.\'\r\n\r\n\'And are prepared for it, general,\' said Redgauntlet; \'we are not men to\r\nbe penned up like sheep for the slaughter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pshaw! you take it too seriously--let me speak but one word with you.\'\r\n\r\n\'No words can shake our purpose,\' said Redgauntlet, were your whole\r\ncommand, as I suppose is the case, drawn round the house.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am certainly not unsupported,\' said the general; \'but if you would\r\nhear me\'--\r\n\r\n\'Hear ME, sir,\' said the Wanderer, stepping forward; \'I suppose I am the\r\nmark you aim at--I surrender myself willingly, to save these gentlemen\'s\r\ndanger--let this at least avail in their favour.\'\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of \'Never, never!\' broke from the little body of\r\npartisans, who threw themselves round the unfortunate prince, and would\r\nhave seized or struck down Campbell, had it not been that he remained\r\nwith his arms folded, and a look, rather indicating impatience because\r\nthey would not hear him, than the least apprehension of violence at\r\ntheir hand.\r\n\r\nAt length he obtained a moment\'s silence. \'I do not,\' he said, \'know\r\nthis gentleman\'--(making a profound bow to the unfortunate prince)--\'I\r\ndo not wish to know him; it is a knowledge which would suit neither of\r\nus.\'\r\n\r\n\'Our ancestors, nevertheless, have been well acquainted,\' said Charles,\r\nunable to suppress, even at that hour of dread and danger, the painful\r\nrecollections of fallen royalty.\r\n\r\n\'In one word, General Campbell,\' said Redgauntlet, \'is it to be peace or\r\nwar? You are a man of honour, and we can trust you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thank you, sir,\' said the general; \'and I reply, that the answer to\r\nyour question rests with yourself. Come, do not be fools, gentlemen;\r\nthere was perhaps no great harm meant or intended by your gathering\r\ntogether in this obscure corner, for a bear-bait or a cock-fight, or\r\nwhatever other amusement you may have intended, but it was a little\r\nimprudent, considering how you stand with government, and it has\r\noccasioned some anxiety. Exaggerated accounts of your purpose have\r\nbeen laid before government by the information of a traitor in your own\r\ncounsels; and I was sent down post to take the command of a sufficient\r\nnumber of troops, in case these calumnies should be found to have any\r\nreal foundation. I have come here, of course, sufficiently supported\r\nboth with cavalry and infantry, to do whatever might be necessary; but\r\nmy commands are--and I am sure they agree with my inclination--to make\r\nno arrests, nay, to make no further inquiries of any kind, if this good\r\nassembly will consider their own interest so far as to give up their\r\nimmediate purpose, and return quietly home to their own houses.\'\r\n\r\n\'What!--all?\' exclaimed Sir Richard Glendale--\'all, without exception?\'\r\n\r\n\'ALL, without one single exception\' said the general; \'such are my\r\norders. If you accept my terms, say so, and make haste; for things may\r\nhappen to interfere with his Majesty\'s kind purposes towards you all.\'\r\n\r\n\'Majesty\'s kind purposes!\' said the Wanderer. \'Do I hear you aright,\r\nsir?\'\r\n\r\n\'I speak the king\'s very words, from his very lips,\' replied the\r\ngeneral. \'"I will," said his Majesty, "deserve the confidence of my\r\nsubjects by reposing my security in the fidelity of the millions who\r\nacknowledge my title--in the good sense and prudence of the few who\r\ncontinue, from the errors of education, to disown it." His Majesty will\r\nnot even believe that the most zealous Jacobites who yet remain can\r\nnourish a thought of exciting a civil war, which must be fatal to their\r\nfamilies and themselves, besides spreading bloodshed and ruin through\r\na peaceful land. He cannot even believe of his kinsman, that he would\r\nengage brave and generous though mistaken men, in an attempt which must\r\nruin all who have escaped former calamities; and he is convinced,\r\nthat, did curiosity or any other motive lead that person to visit this\r\ncountry, he would soon see it was his wisest course to return to the\r\ncontinent; and his Majesty compassionates his situation too much to\r\noffer any obstacle to his doing so.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is this real?\' said Redgauntlet. \'Can you mean this? Am I--are all, are\r\nany of these gentlemen at liberty, without interruption, to embark in\r\nyonder brig, which, I see, is now again approaching the shore?\'\r\n\r\n\'You, sir--all--any of the gentlemen present,\' said the general,--\'all\r\nwhom the vessel can contain, are at liberty to embark uninterrupted\r\nby me; but I advise none to go off who have not powerful reasons\r\nunconnected with the present meeting, for this will be remembered\r\nagainst no one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then, gentlemen,\' said Redgauntlet, clasping his hands together as the\r\nwords burst from him, \'the cause is lost for ever!\'\r\n\r\nGeneral Campbell turned away to the window, as if to avoid hearing what\r\nthey said. Their consultation was but momentary; for the door of escape\r\nwhich thus opened was as unexpected as the exigence was threatening.\r\n\r\n\'We have your word of honour for our protection,\' said Sir Richard\r\nGlendale, \'if we dissolve our meeting in obedience to your summons?\'\r\n\r\n\'You have, Sir Richard,\' answered the general.\r\n\r\n\'And I also have your promise,\' said Redgauntlet, \'that I may go on\r\nboard yonder vessel, with any friend whom I may choose to accompany me?\'\r\n\r\nNot only that, Mr. Ingoldsby--or I WILL call you Mr. Redgauntlet once\r\nmore--you may stay in the offing for a tide, until you are joined by any\r\nperson who may remain at Fairladies. After that, there will be a sloop\r\nof war on the station, and I need not say your condition will then\r\nbecome perilous.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perilous it should not be, General Campbell,\' said Redgauntlet, \'or\r\nmore perilous to others than to us, if others thought as I do even in\r\nthis extremity.\'\r\n\r\n\'You forget yourself, my friend,\' said the unhappy Adventurer; you\r\nforget that the arrival of this gentleman only puts the cope-stone on\r\nour already adopted resolution to abandon our bull-fight or by whatever\r\nother wild name this headlong enterprise may be termed. I bid you\r\nfarewell, unfriendly friends--I bid you farewell,\' (bowing to the\r\ngeneral) \'my friendly foe--I leave this strand as I landed upon it,\r\nalone and to return no more!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not alone,\' said Redgauntlet, \'while there is blood in the veins of my\r\nfather\'s son.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not alone,\' said the other gentlemen present, stung with feelings which\r\nalmost overpowered the better reasons under which they had acted. \'We\r\nwill not disown our principles, or see your person endangered.\'\r\n\r\n\'If it be only your purpose to see the gentleman to the beach,\' said\r\nGeneral Campbell, \'I will myself go with you. My presence among you,\r\nunarmed, and in your power, will be a pledge of my friendly intentions,\r\nand will overawe, should such be offered, any interruption on the part\r\nof officious persons.\'\r\n\r\n\'Be it so,\' said the Adventurer, with the air of a prince to a subject,\r\nnot of one who complied with the request of an enemy too powerful to be\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\nThey left the apartment--they left the house--an unauthenticated and\r\ndubious, but appalling, sensation of terror had already spread itself\r\namong the inferior retainers, who had so short time before strutted, and\r\nbustled, and thronged the doorway and the passages. A report had arisen,\r\nof which the origin could not be traced, of troops advancing towards the\r\nspot in considerable numbers; and men who, for one reason or other,\r\nwere most of them amenable to the arm of power, had either shrunk into\r\nstables or corners, or fled the place entirely. There was solitude on\r\nthe landscape excepting the small party which now moved towards the\r\nrude pier, where a boat lay manned, agreeably to Redgauntlet\'s orders\r\npreviously given.\r\n\r\nThe last heir of the Stuarts leant on Redgauntlet\'s arm as they walked\r\ntowards the beach; for the ground was rough, and he no longer possessed\r\nthe elasticity of limb and of spirit which had, twenty years before,\r\ncarried him over many a Highland hill as light as one of their native\r\ndeer. His adherents followed, looking on the ground, their feelings\r\nstruggling against the dictates of their reason.\r\n\r\nGeneral Campbell accompanied them with an air of apparent ease and\r\nindifference, but watching, at the same time, and no doubt with some\r\nanxiety, the changing features of those who acted in this extraordinary\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nDarsie and his sister naturally followed their uncle, whose violence\r\nthey no longer feared, while his character attracted their respect, and\r\nAlan Fairford attended them from interest in their fate, unnoticed in\r\na party where all were too much occupied with their own thoughts\r\nand feelings, as well as with the impending crisis, to attend to his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nHalf-way betwixt the house and the beach, they saw the bodies of Nanty\r\nEwart and Cristal Nixon blackening in the sun.\r\n\r\n\'That was your informer?\' said Redgauntlet, looking back to General\r\nCampbell, who only nodded his assent.\r\n\r\n\'Caitiff wretch!\' exclaimed Redgauntlet;--\'and yet the name were better\r\nbestowed on the fool who could be misled by thee.\'\r\n\r\n\'That sound broadsword cut,\' said the general, \'has saved us the shame\r\nof rewarding a traitor.\'\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the place of embarkation. The prince stood a moment with\r\nfolded arms, and looked around him in deep silence. A paper was then\r\nslipped into his hands--he looked at it, and said, \'I find the two\r\nfriends I have left at Fairladies are apprised of my destination,\r\nand propose to embark from Bowness. I presume this will not be an\r\ninfringement of the conditions under which you have acted?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not,\' answered General Campbell; \'they shall have all\r\nfacility to join you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish, then,\' said Charles, \'only another companion. Redgauntlet, the\r\nair of this country is as hostile to you as it is to me. These gentlemen\r\nhave made their peace, or rather they have done nothing to break it.\r\nBut you--come you and share my home where chance shall cast it. We\r\nshall never see these shores again; but we will talk of them, and of our\r\ndisconcerted bull-fight.\'\r\n\r\n\'I follow you, sire, through life,\' said Redgauntlet, \'as I would have\r\nfollowed you to death. Permit me one moment.\'\r\n\r\nThe prince then looked round, and seeing the abashed countenances of his\r\nother adherents bent upon the ground, he hastened to say, \'Do not think\r\nthat you, gentlemen, have obliged me less because your zeal was mingled\r\nwith prudence, entertained, I am sure, more on my own account and on\r\nthat of your country, than from selfish apprehensions.\'\r\n\r\nHe stepped from one to another, and, amid sobs and bursting tears,\r\nreceived the adieus of the last remnant which had hitherto supported\r\nhis lofty pretensions, and addressed them individually with accents of\r\ntenderness and affection.\r\n\r\nThe general drew a little aloof, and signed to Redgauntlet to speak\r\nwith him while this scene proceeded. \'It is now all over,\' he said, \'and\r\nJacobite will be henceforward no longer a party name. When you tire of\r\nforeign parts, and wish to make your peace, let me know. Your restless\r\nzeal alone has impeded your pardon hitherto.\'\r\n\r\n\'And now I shall not need it,\' said Redgauntlet. \'I leave England\r\nfor ever; but I am not displeased that you should hear my family\r\nadieus.--Nephew, come hither. In presence of General Campbell, I tell\r\nyou, that though to breed you up in my own political opinions has been\r\nfor many years my anxious wish, I am now glad that it could not be\r\naccomplished. You pass under the service of the reigning monarch without\r\nthe necessity of changing your allegiance--a change, however,\' he added,\r\nlooking around him, which sits more easy on honourable men than I could\r\nhave anticipated; but some wear the badge of their loyalty on their\r\nsleeve, and others in the heart. You will, from henceforth, be\r\nuncontrolled master of all the property of which forfeiture could not\r\ndeprive your father--of all that belonged to him--excepting this, his\r\ngood sword\' (laying his hand on the weapon he wore), \'which shall never\r\nfight for the House of Hanover; and as my hand will never draw weapon\r\nmore, I shall sink it forty fathoms deep in the wide ocean. Bless you,\r\nyoung man! If I have dealt harshly with you, forgive me. I had set my\r\nwhole desires on one point,--God knows, with no selfish purpose; and\r\nI am justly punished by this final termination of my views, for having\r\nbeen too little scrupulous in the means by which I pursued them.--Niece,\r\nfarewell, and may God bless you also!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, sir,\' said Lilias, seizing his hand eagerly. \'You have been\r\nhitherto my protector,--you are now in sorrow, let me be your attendant\r\nand your comforter in exile.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thank you, my girl, for your unmerited affection; but it cannot and\r\nmust not be. The curtain here falls between us. I go to the house of\r\nanother. If I leave it before I quit the earth, it shall be only for the\r\nHouse of God. Once more, farewell both! The fatal doom,\' he said, with\r\na melancholy smile, \'will, I trust, now depart from the House of\r\nRedgauntlet, since its present representative has adhered to the winning\r\nside. I am convinced he will not change it, should it in turn become the\r\nlosing one.\'\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Charles Edward had now given his last adieus to his\r\ndowncast adherents. He made a sign with his hand to Redgauntlet, who\r\ncame to assist him into the skiff. General Campbell also offered his\r\nassistance, the rest appearing too much affected by the scene which had\r\ntaken place to prevent him.\r\n\r\n\'You are not sorry, general, to do me this last act of courtesy,\' said\r\nthe Chevalier; \'and, on my part, I thank you for it. You have taught me\r\nthe principle on which men on the scaffold feel forgiveness and kindness\r\neven for their executioner. Farewell!\'\r\n\r\nThey were seated in the boat, which presently pulled off from the land.\r\nThe Oxford divine broke out into a loud benediction, in terms which\r\nGeneral Campbell was too generous to criticize at the time, or to\r\nremember afterwards;--nay, it is said, that, Whig and Campbell as he\r\nwas, he could not help joining in the universal Amen! which resounded\r\nfrom the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION, BY DR. DRYASDUST\r\n\r\nIN A LETTER TO THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY\r\n\r\nI am truly sorry, my worthy and much-respected sir, that my anxious\r\nresearches have neither, in the form of letters, nor of diaries or other\r\nmemoranda, been able to discover more than I have hitherto transmitted,\r\nof the history of the Redgauntlet family. But I observe in an old\r\nnewspaper called the WHITEHALL GAZETTE, of which I fortunately possess a\r\nfile for several years, that Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet was\r\npresented to his late Majesty at the drawing-room, by Lieut.-General\r\nCampbell--upon which the editor observes, in the way of comment, that\r\nwe were going, REMIS ATQUE VELIS, into the interests of the Pretender,\r\nsince a Scot had presented a Jacobite at Court. I am sorry I have not\r\nroom (the frank being only uncial) for his further observations, tending\r\nto show the apprehensions entertained by many well-instructed persons of\r\nthe period, that the young king might himself be induced to become one\r\nof the Stuarts\' faction,--a catastrophe from which it has pleased Heaven\r\nto preserve these kingdoms.\r\n\r\nI perceive also, by a marriage-contract in the family repositories, that\r\nMiss Lilias Redgauntlet of Redgauntlet, about eighteen months after the\r\ntransactions you have commemorated, intermarried with Alan Fairford,\r\nEsq., Advocate, of Clinkdollar, who, I think, we may not unreasonably\r\nconclude to be the same person whose name occurs so frequently in\r\nthe pages of your narration. In my last excursion to Edinburgh, I was\r\nfortunate enough to discover an old caddie, from whom, at the expense\r\nof a bottle of whisky and half a pound of tobacco, I extracted the\r\nimportant information, that he knew Peter Peebles very well, and had\r\ndrunk many a mutchkin with him in Caddie Fraser\'s time. He said \'that\r\nhe lived ten years after King George\'s accession, in the momentary\r\nexpectation of winning his cause every day in the session time, and\r\nevery hour in the day, and at last fell down dead, in what my informer\r\ncalled a \'perplexity fit,\' upon a proposal for a composition being made\r\nto him in the Outer House. I have chosen to retain my informer\'s phrase,\r\nnot being able justly to determine whether it is a corruption of the\r\nword apoplexy, as my friend Mr. Oldbuck supposes, or the name of some\r\npeculiar disorder incidental to those who have concern in the courts of\r\nlaw, as many callings and conditions of men have diseases appropriate to\r\nthemselves. The same caddie also remembered Blind Willie Stevenson, who\r\nwas called Wandering Willie, and who ended his days \'unco beinly, in Sir\r\nArthur Redgauntlet\'s ha\' neuk.\' \'He had done the family some good turn,\'\r\nhe said, \'specially when ane of the Argyle gentlemen was coming down on\r\na wheen of them that had the "auld leaven" about them, and wad hae taen\r\nevery man of them, and nae less nor headed and hanged them. But Willie,\r\nand a friend they had, called Robin the Rambler, gae them warning, by\r\nplaying tunes such as "The Campbells are coming" and the like, whereby\r\nthey got timeous warning to take the wing.\' I need not point out to your\r\nacuteness, my worthy sir, that this seems to refer to some inaccurate\r\naccount of the transactions in which you seem so much interested.\r\n\r\nRespecting Redgauntlet, about whose subsequent history you are more\r\nparticularly inquisitive, I have learned from an excellent person\r\nwho was a priest in the Scottish Monastery of Ratisbon, before its\r\nsuppression, that he remained for two or three years in the family of\r\nthe Chevalier, and only left it at last in consequence of some discords\r\nin that melancholy household. As he had hinted to General Campbell, he\r\nexchanged his residence for the cloister, and displayed in the latter\r\npart of his life, a strong sense of the duties of religion, which in\r\nhis earlier days he had too much neglected, being altogether engaged in\r\npolitical speculations and intrigues. He rose to the situation of prior,\r\nin the house which he belonged to, and which was of a very strict order\r\nof religion. He sometimes received his countrymen, whom accident brought\r\nto Ratisbon, and curiosity induced to visit the Monastery of ------. But\r\nit was remarked, that though he listened with interest and attention,\r\nwhen Britain, or particularly Scotland, became the subject of\r\nconversation, yet he never either introduced or prolonged the subject,\r\nnever used the English language, never inquired about English affairs,\r\nand, above all, never mentioned his own family. His strict observation\r\nof the rules of his order gave him, at the time of his death, some\r\npretensions to be chosen a saint, and the brethren of the Monastery\r\nof ------ made great efforts for that effect, and brought forward some\r\nplausible proofs of miracles. But there was a circumstance which threw\r\na doubt over the subject, and prevented the consistory from acceding\r\nto the wishes of the worthy brethren. Under his habit, and secured in\r\na small silver box, he had worn perpetually around his neck a lock\r\nof-hair, which the fathers avouched to be a relic. But the Avvocato del\r\nDiabolo, in combating (as was his official duty) the pretensions of\r\nthe candidate for sanctity, made it at least equally probable that the\r\nsupposed relic was taken from the head of a brother of the deceased\r\nprior, who had been executed for adherence to the Stuart family in\r\n1745-6; and the motto, HAUD OBLIVISCENDUM, seemed to intimate a tone\r\nof mundane feeling and recollection of injuries, which made it at least\r\ndoubtful whether, even in the quiet and gloom of the cloister,\r\nFather Hugo had forgotten the sufferings and injuries of the House of\r\nRedgauntlet.\r\n\r\nJune 10, 1824,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nNOTE 1.--THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS\r\n\r\nIn explanation of this circumstance, I cannot help adding a note not\r\nvery necessary for the reader, which yet I record with pleasure, from\r\nrecollection of the kindness which it evinces. In early youth I resided\r\nfor a considerable time in the vicinity of the beautiful village\r\nof Kelso, where my life passed in a very solitary manner. I had few\r\nacquaintances, scarce any companions, and books, which were at the time\r\nalmost essential to my happiness, were difficult to come by. It was then\r\nthat I was particularly indebted to the liberality and friendship of\r\nan old lady of the Society of Friends, eminent for her benevolence and\r\ncharity. Her deceased husband had been a medical man of eminence,\r\nand left her, with other valuable property, a small and well-selected\r\nlibrary. This the kind old lady permitted me to rummage at pleasure, and\r\ncarry home what volumes I chose, on condition that I should take, at the\r\nsame time, some of the tracts printed for encouraging and extending the\r\ndoctrines of her own sect. She did not even exact any promise that I\r\nwould read these performances, being too justly afraid of involving me\r\nin a breach of promise, but was merely desirous that I should have\r\nthe chance of instruction within my reach, in case whim, curiosity, or\r\naccident, might induce me to have recourse to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 2.--THE PERSECUTORS\r\n\r\nThe personages here mentioned are most of them characters of historical\r\nfame; but those less known and remembered may be found in the tract\r\nentitled, \'The Judgment and Justice of God Exemplified, or, a Brief\r\nHistorical Account of some of the Wicked Lives and Miserable Deaths of\r\nsome of the most remarkable Apostates and Bloody Persecutors, from\r\nthe Reformation till after the Revolution.\' This constitutes a sort of\r\npostscript or appendix to John Howie of Lochgoin\'s \'Account of the Lives\r\nof the most eminent Scots Worthies.\' The author has, with considerable\r\ningenuity, reversed his reasoning upon the inference to be drawn from\r\nthe prosperity or misfortunes which befall individuals in this world,\r\neither in the course of their lives or in the hour of death. In the\r\naccount of the martyrs\' sufferings, such inflictions are mentioned only\r\nas trials permitted by providence, for the better and brighter display\r\nof their faith, and constancy of principle. But when similar afflictions\r\nbefell the opposite party, they are imputed to the direct vengeance of\r\nHeaven upon their impiety. If, indeed, the life of any person obnoxious\r\nto the historian\'s censures happened to have passed in unusual\r\nprosperity, the mere fact of its being finally concluded by death,\r\nis assumed as an undeniable token of the judgement of Heaven, and, to\r\nrender the conclusion inevitable, his last scene is generally garnished\r\nwith some singular circumstances. Thus the Duke of Lauderdale is said,\r\nthrough old age but immense corpulence, to have become so sunk in\r\nspirits, \'that his heart was not the bigness of a walnut.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 3.--LAMENTATION FOR THE DEAD\r\n\r\nI have heard in my youth some such wild tale as that placed in the\r\nmouth of the blind fiddler, of which, I think, the hero was Sir Robert\r\nGrierson of Lagg, the famous persecutor. But the belief was general\r\nthroughout Scotland that the excessive lamentation over the loss of\r\nfriends disturbed the repose of the dead, and broke even the rest of the\r\ngrave. There are several instances of this in tradition, but one struck\r\nme particularly, as I heard it from the lips of one who professed\r\nreceiving it from those of a ghost-seer. This was a Highland lady, named\r\nMrs. C---- of B------, who probably believed firmly in the truth of an\r\napparition which seems to have originated in the weakness of her nerves\r\nand strength of her imagination. She had been lately left a widow by her\r\nhusband, with the office of guardian to their only child. The young man\r\nadded to the difficulties of his charge by an extreme propensity for a\r\nmilitary life, which his mother was unwilling to give way to, while\r\nshe found it impossible to repress it. About this time the Independent\r\nCompanies, formed for the preservation of the peace of the Highlands,\r\nwere in the course of being levied; and as a gentleman named Cameron,\r\nnearly connected with Mrs. C--, commanded one of those companies,\r\nshe was at length persuaded to compromise the matter with her son, by\r\npermitting him to enter this company in the capacity of a cadet, thus\r\ngratifying his love of a military life without the dangers of foreign\r\nservice, to which no one then thought these troops were at all liable to\r\nbe exposed, while even their active service at home was not likely to\r\nbe attended with much danger. She readily obtained a promise from her\r\nrelative that he would be particular in his attention to her son and\r\ntherefore concluded she had accommodated matters between her son\'s\r\nwishes and his safety in a way sufficiently attentive to both. She set\r\noff to Edinburgh to get what was awanting for his outfit, and shortly\r\nafterwards received melancholy news from the Highlands. The Independent\r\nCompany into which her son was to enter had a skirmish with a party of\r\ncaterans engaged in some act of spoil, and her friend the captain\r\nbeing wounded, and out of the reach of medical assistance, died in\r\nconsequence. This news was a thunderbolt to the poor mother, who was at\r\nonce deprived of her kinsman\'s advice and assistance, and instructed by\r\nhis fate of the unexpected danger to which her son\'s new calling exposed\r\nhim. She remained also in great sorrow for her relative, whom she loved\r\nwith sisterly affection. These conflicting causes of anxiety,\r\ntogether with her uncertainty, whether to continue or change her son\'s\r\ndestination, were terminated in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nThe house in which Mrs. C---- resided in the old town of Edinburgh, was\r\na flat or story of a land accessible, as was then universal, by a common\r\nstair. The family who occupied the story beneath were her acquaintances,\r\nand she was in the habit of drinking tea with them every evening. It was\r\naccordingly about six o\'clock, when, recovering herself from a deep fit\r\nof anxious reflection, she was about to leave the parlour in which she\r\nsat in order to attend this engagement. The door through which she was\r\nto pass opened, as was very common in Edinburgh, into a dark passage. In\r\nthis passage, and within a yard of her when she opened the door,\r\nstood the apparition of her kinsman, the deceased officer, in his full\r\ntartans, and wearing his bonnet. Terrified at what she saw, or thought\r\nshe saw, she closed the door hastily, and, sinking on her knees by\r\na chair, prayed to be delivered from the horrors of the vision. She\r\nremained in that posture till her friends below tapped on the door,\r\nto intimate that tea was ready. Recalled to herself by the signal, she\r\narose, and, on opening the apartment door, again was confronted by\r\nthe visionary Highlander, whose bloody brow bore token, on this second\r\nappearance, to the death he had died. Unable to endure this repetition\r\nof her terrors, Mrs. C---- sank on the door in a swoon. Her friends\r\nbelow, startled with the noise, came upstairs, and, alarmed at the\r\nsituation in which they found her, insisted on her going to bed and\r\ntaking some medicine, in order to compose what they took for a nervous\r\nattack. They had no sooner left her in quiet, than the apparition of\r\nthe soldier was once more visible in the apartment. This time she took\r\ncourage and said, \'In the name of God, Donald, why do you haunt one who\r\nrespected and loved you when living?\' To which he answered readily, in\r\nGaelic, \'Cousin, why did you not speak sooner? My rest is disturbed by\r\nyour unnecessary lamentation--your tears scald me in my shroud. I come\r\nto tell you that my untimely death ought to make no difference in your\r\nviews for your son; God will raise patrons to supply my place and he\r\nwill live to the fullness of years, and die honoured and at peace.\' The\r\nlady of course followed her kinsman\'s advice and as she was accounted\r\na person of strict veracity, we may conclude the first apparition an\r\nillusion of the fancy, the final one a lively dream suggested by the\r\nother two.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 4.--PETER PEEBLES\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate litigant (for a person named Peter Peebles actually\r\nflourished) frequented the courts of justice in Scotland about the year\r\n1792, and the sketch of his appearance is given from recollection. The\r\nauthor is of opinion that he himself had at one time the honour to be\r\ncounsel for Peter Peebles, whose voluminous course of litigation served\r\nas a sort of assay-pieces to most young men who were called to the bar.\r\nThe scene of the consultation is entirely imaginary.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 5.--JOHN\'S COFFEE-HOUSE\r\n\r\nThis small dark coffee-house, now burnt down, was the resort of such\r\nwriters and clerks belonging to the Parliament House above thirty years\r\nago as retained the ancient Scottish custom of a meridian, as it was\r\ncalled, or noontide dram of spirits. If their proceedings were watched,\r\nthey might be seen to turn fidgety about the hour of noon, and exchange\r\nlooks with each other from their separate desks, till at length some one\r\nof formal and dignified presence assumed the honour of leading the band,\r\nwhen away they went, threading the crowd like a string of wild\r\nfowl, crossed the square or close, and following each other into\r\nthe coffee-house, received in turn from the hand of the waiter, the\r\nmeridian, which was placed ready at the bar. This they did, day by day:\r\nand though they did not speak to each other, they seemed to attach a\r\ncertain degree of sociability to performing the ceremony in company.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 6.--FISHING RIGHTS\r\n\r\nIt may be here mentioned, that a violent and popular attack upon what\r\nthe country people of this district considered as an invasion of their\r\nfishing right is by no means an improbable fiction. Shortly after the\r\nclose of the American war, Sir James Graham of Netherby constructed a\r\ndam-dyke, or cauld, across the Esk, at a place where it flowed through\r\nhis estate, though it has its origin, and the principal part of its\r\ncourse, in Scotland. The new barrier at Netherby was considered as\r\nan encroachment calculated to prevent the salmon from ascending into\r\nScotland, and the right of erecting it being an international question\r\nof law betwixt the sister kingdoms, there was no court in either\r\ncompetent to its decision. In this dilemma, the Scots people assembled\r\nin numbers by signal of rocket lights, and, rudely armed with\r\nfowling-pieces, fish-spears, and such rustic weapons, marched to the\r\nbanks of the river for the purpose of pulling down the dam-dyke objected\r\nto. Sir James Graham armed many of his own people to protect his\r\nproperty, and had some military from Carlisle for the same purpose.\r\nA renewal of the Border wars had nearly taken place in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when prudence and moderation on both sides saved much tumult,\r\nand perhaps some bloodshed. The English proprietor consented that a\r\nbreach should be made in his dam-dyke sufficient for the passage of the\r\nfish, and thus removed the Scottish grievance. I believe the river has\r\nsince that time taken the matter into its own disposal, and entirely\r\nswept away the dam-dyke in question.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 7.--STATE OF SCOTLAND\r\n\r\nScotland, in its half-civilized state, exhibited too many examples\r\nof the exertion of arbitrary force and violence, rendered easy by the\r\ndominion which lairds exerted over their tenants and chiefs over their\r\nclans. The captivity of Lady Grange, in the desolate cliffs of Saint\r\nKilda, is in the recollection of every one. At the supposed date of the\r\nnovel also a man of the name of Merrilees, a tanner in Leith, absconded\r\nfrom his country to escape his creditors; and after having slain his own\r\nmastiff dog, and put a bit of red cloth in its mouth, as if it had died\r\nin a contest with soldiers, and involved his own existence in as\r\nmuch mystery as possible, made his escape into Yorkshire. Here he was\r\ndetected by persons sent in search of him, to whom he gave a portentous\r\naccount of his having been carried off and concealed in various places.\r\nMr. Merrilees was, in short, a kind of male Elizabeth Canning, but did\r\nnot trespass on the public credulity quite so long.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 8.--CONCEALMENTS FOR THEFT AND SMUGGLING\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that the modes of concealment described in the\r\nimaginary premises of Mr. Trumbull, are of a kind which have been common\r\non the frontiers of late years. The neighbourhood of two nations having\r\ndifferent laws, though united in government, still leads to a multitude\r\nof transgressions on the Border, and extreme difficulty in apprehending\r\ndelinquents. About twenty years since, as far as my recollection serves,\r\nthere was along the frontier an organized gang of coiners, forgers,\r\nsmugglers, and other malefactors, whose operations were conducted on a\r\nscale not inferior to what is here described. The chief of the party was\r\none Richard Mendham a carpenter, who rose to opulence, although ignorant\r\neven of the arts of reading and writing. But he had found a short\r\nroad to wealth, and had taken singular measures for conducting his\r\noperations. Amongst these, he found means to build, in a suburb\r\nof Berwick called Spittal, a street of small houses, as if for the\r\ninvestment of property. He himself inhabited one of these; another, a\r\nspecies of public-house, was open to his confederates, who held secret\r\nand unsuspected communication with him by crossing the roofs of the\r\nintervening houses, and descending by a trap-stair, which admitted them\r\ninto the alcove of the dining-room of Dick Mendham\'s private mansion.\r\nA vault, too, beneath Mendham\'s stable, was accessible in the manner\r\nmentioned in the novel. The post of one of the stalls turned round on\r\na bolt being withdrawn, and gave admittance to a subterranean place of\r\nconcealment for contraband and stolen goods, to a great extent. Richard\r\nMendham, the head of this very formidable conspiracy, which involved\r\nmalefactors of every kind, was tried and executed at Jedburgh, where the\r\nauthor was present as Sheriff of Selkirkshire. Mendham had previously\r\nbeen tried, but escaped by want of proof and the ingenuity of his\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 9--CORONATION OF GEORGE III\r\n\r\nIn excuse of what may be considered as a violent infraction of\r\nprobability in this chapter, the author is under the necessity of\r\nquoting a tradition which many persons may recollect having heard. It\r\nwas always said, though with very little appearance of truth, that upon\r\nthe Coronation of the late George III, when the champion of England,\r\nDymock, or his representative, appeared in Westminster Hall, and in\r\nthe language of chivalry solemnly wagered his body to defend in single\r\ncombat the right of the young King to the crown of these realms, at the\r\nmoment when he flung down his gauntlet as the gage of battle, an unknown\r\nfemale stepped from the crowd and lifted the pledge, leaving another\r\ngage in room of it, with a paper expressing, that if a fair field of\r\ncombat should be allowed, a champion of rank and birth would appear with\r\nequal arms to dispute the claim of King George to the British kingdoms.\r\nThe story is probably one of the numerous fictions which were circulated\r\nto keep up the spirits of a sinking faction, The incident was, however,\r\npossible, if it could be supposed to be attended by any motive adequate\r\nto the risk, and might be imagined to occur to a person of Redgauntlet\'s\r\nenthusiastic character. George III, it is said, had a police of his own,\r\nwhose agency was so efficient, that the sovereign was able to tell\r\nhis prime minister upon one occasion, to his great surprise, that the\r\nPretender was in London. The prime minister began immediately to talk of\r\nmeasures to be taken, warrants to be procured, messengers and guards\r\nto be got in readiness. \'Pooh, pooh,\' said the good-natured sovereign,\r\nsince I have found him out, leave me alone to deal with him.\'--\'And\r\nwhat,\' said the minister, \'is your Majesty\'s purpose, in so important a\r\ncase?\'--\'To leave the young man to himself,\' said George III; \'and when\r\nhe tires he will go back again.\' The truth of this story does not depend\r\non that of the lifting of the gauntlet; and while the latter could be\r\nbut an idle bravado, the former expresses George Ill\'s goodness of heart\r\nand soundness of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 10.--COLLIER AND SALTER\r\n\r\nThe persons engaged in these occupations were at this time bondsmen; and\r\nin case they left the ground of the farm to which they belonged, and as\r\npertaining to which their services were bought or sold, they were liable\r\nto be brought back by a summary process. The existence of this species\r\nof slavery being thought irreconcilable with the spirit of liberty,\r\ncolliers and salters were declared free, and put upon the same footing\r\nwith other servants, by the Act 15 Geo.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
