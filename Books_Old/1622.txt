I have only\r\nto request that you will bear in mind certain established truths, which\r\noccasionally escape your memory when you are reading a work of fiction.\r\nBe pleased, then, to remember (First): That the actions of human beings\r\nare not invariably governed by the laws of pure reason. (Secondly):\r\nThat we are by no means always in the habit of bestowing our love on\r\nthe objects which are the most deserving of it, in the opinions of\r\nour friends. (Thirdly and Lastly): That Characters which may not have\r\nappeared, and Events which may not have taken place, within the limits\r\nof our own individual experience, may nevertheless be perfectly natural\r\nCharacters and perfectly probable Events, for all that. Having said\r\nthese few words, I have said all that seems to be necessary at the\r\npresent time, in presenting my new Story to your notice.\r\n\r\nW. C.\r\n\r\nLONDON, February 1, 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW AND THE LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I. PARADISE LOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE BRIDE\'S MISTAKE.\r\n\r\n"FOR after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted\r\nin God adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands;\r\neven as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose daughters ye are\r\nas long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement."\r\n\r\nConcluding the Marriage Service of the Church of England in those\r\nwell-known words, my uncle Starkweather shut up his book, and looked at\r\nme across the altar rails with a hearty expression of interest on his\r\nbroad, red face. At the same time my aunt, Mrs. Starkweather, standing\r\nby my side, tapped me smartly on the shoulder, and said,\r\n\r\n"Valeria, you are married!"\r\n\r\nWhere were my thoughts? What had become of my attention? I was too\r\nbewildered to know. I started and looked at my new husband. He seemed\r\nto be almost as much bewildered as I was. The same thought had, as\r\nI believe, occurred to us both at the same moment. Was it really\r\npossible--in spite of his mother\'s opposition to our marriage--that we\r\nwere Man and Wife? My aunt Starkweather settled the question by a second\r\ntap on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Take his arm!" she whispered, in the tone of a woman who had lost all\r\npatience with me.\r\n\r\nI took his arm.\r\n\r\n"Follow your uncle."\r\n\r\nHolding fast by my husband\'s arm, I followed my uncle and the curate who\r\nhad assisted him at the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe two clergymen led us into the vestry. The church was in one of the\r\ndreary quarters of London, situated between the City and the West\r\nEnd; the day was dull; the atmosphere was heavy and damp. We were a\r\nmelancholy little wedding party, worthy of the dreary neighborhood and\r\nthe dull day. No relatives or friends of my husband\'s were present; his\r\nfamily, as I have already hinted, disapproved of his marriage. Except\r\nmy uncle and my aunt, no other relations appeared on my side. I had lost\r\nboth my parents, and I had but few friends. My dear father\'s faithful\r\nold clerk, Benjamin, attended the wedding to "give me away," as the\r\nphrase is. He had known me from a child, and, in my forlorn position, he\r\nwas as good as a father to me.\r\n\r\nThe last ceremony left to be performed was, as usual, the signing of the\r\nmarriage register. In the confusion of the moment (and in the absence of\r\nany information to guide me) I committed a mistake--ominous, in my aunt\r\nStarkweather\'s opinion, of evil to come. I signed my married instead of\r\nmy maiden name.\r\n\r\n"What!" cried my uncle, in his loudest and cheeriest tones, "you have\r\nforgotten your own name already? Well, well! let us hope you will never\r\nrepent parting with it so readily. Try again, Valeria--try again."\r\n\r\nWith trembling fingers I struck the pen through my first effort, and\r\nwrote my maiden name, very badly indeed, as follows:\r\n\r\nValeria Brinton\r\n\r\nWhen it came to my husband\'s turn I noticed, with surprise, that his\r\nhand trembled too, and that he produced a very poor specimen of his\r\ncustomary signature:\r\n\r\nEustace Woodville\r\n\r\nMy aunt, on being requested to sign, complied under protest. "A bad\r\nbeginning!" she said, pointing to my first unfortunate signature with\r\nthe feather end of her pen. "I hope, my dear, you may not live to regret\r\nit."\r\n\r\nEven then, in the days of my ignorance and my innocence, that curious\r\noutbreak of my aunt\'s superstition produced a certain uneasy sensation\r\nin my mind. It was a consolation to me to feel the reassuring pressure\r\nof my husband\'s hand. It was an indescribable relief to hear my uncle\'s\r\nhearty voice wishing me a happy life at parting. The good man had left\r\nhis north-country Vicarage (my home since the death of my parents)\r\nexpressly to read the service at my marriage; and he and my aunt had\r\narranged to return by the mid-day train. He folded me in his great\r\nstrong arms, and he gave me a kiss which must certainly have been heard\r\nby the idlers waiting for the bride and bridegroom outside the church\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"I wish you health and happiness, my love, with all my heart. You are\r\nold enough to choose for yourself, and--no offense, Mr. Woodville, you\r\nand I are new friends--and I pray God, Valeria, it may turn out that\r\nyou have chosen well. Our house will be dreary enough without you; but\r\nI don\'t complain, my dear. On the contrary, if this change in your life\r\nmakes you happier, I rejoice. Come, come! don\'t cry, or you will set\r\nyour aunt off--and it\'s no joke at her time of life. Besides, crying\r\nwill spoil your beauty. Dry your eyes and look in the glass there, and\r\nyou will see that I am right. Good-by, child--and God bless you!"\r\n\r\nHe tucked my aunt under his arm, and hurried out. My heart sank a\r\nlittle, dearly as I loved my husband, when I had seen the last of the\r\ntrue friend and protector of my maiden days.\r\n\r\nThe parting with old Benjamin came next. "I wish you well, my dear;\r\ndon\'t forget me," was all he said. But the old days at home came back\r\non me at those few words. Benjamin always dined with us on Sundays in my\r\nfather\'s time, and always brought some little present with him for his\r\nmaster\'s child. I was very near to "spoiling my beauty" (as my uncle had\r\nput it) when I offered the old man my cheek to kiss, and heard him sigh\r\nto himself, as if he too were not quite hopeful about my future life.\r\n\r\nMy husband\'s voice roused me, and turned my mind to happier thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go, Valeria?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI stopped him on our way out to take advantage of my uncle\'s advice; in\r\nother words, to see how I looked in the glass over the vestry fireplace.\r\n\r\nWhat does the glass show me?\r\n\r\nThe glass shows a tall and slender young woman of three-and-twenty years\r\nof age. She is not at all the sort of person who attracts attention in\r\nthe street, seeing that she fails to exhibit the popular yellow hair and\r\nthe popular painted cheeks. Her hair is black; dressed, in these later\r\ndays (as it was dressed years since to please her father), in broad\r\nripples drawn back from the forehead, and gathered into a simple knot\r\nbehind (like the hair of the Venus de Medicis), so as to show the neck\r\nbeneath. Her complexion is pale: except in moments of violent agitation\r\nthere is no color to be seen in her face. Her eyes are of so dark a blue\r\nthat they are generally mistaken for black. Her eyebrows are well enough\r\nin form, but they are too dark and too strongly marked. Her nose just\r\ninclines toward the aquiline bend, and is considered a little too large\r\nby persons difficult to please in the matter of noses. The mouth, her\r\nbest feature, is very delicately shaped, and is capable of presenting\r\ngreat varieties of expression. As to the face in general, it is too\r\nnarrow and too long at the lower part, too broad and too low in the\r\nhigher regions of the eyes and the head. The whole picture, as reflected\r\nin the glass, represents a woman of some elegance, rather too pale, and\r\nrather too sedate and serious in her moments of silence and repose--in\r\nshort, a person who fails to strike the ordinary observer at first\r\nsight, but who gains in general estimation on a second, and sometimes\r\non a third view. As for her dress, it studiously conceals, instead of\r\nproclaiming, that she has been married that morning. She wears a gray\r\ncashmere tunic trimmed with gray silk, and having a skirt of the\r\nsame material and color beneath it. On her head is a bonnet to match,\r\nrelieved by a quilling of white muslin with one deep red rose, as a\r\nmorsel of positive color, to complete the effect of the whole dress.\r\n\r\nHave I succeeded or failed in describing the picture of myself which I\r\nsee in the glass? It is not for me to say. I have done my best to keep\r\nclear of the two vanities--the vanity of depreciating and the vanity of\r\npraising my own personal appearance. For the rest, well written or badly\r\nwritten, thank Heaven it is done!\r\n\r\nAnd whom do I see in the glass standing by my side?\r\n\r\nI see a man who is not quite so tall as I am, and who has the misfortune\r\nof looking older than his years. His forehead is prematurely bald.\r\nHis big chestnut-colored beard and his long overhanging mustache are\r\nprematurely streaked with gray. He has the color in the face which my\r\nface wants, and the firmness in his figure which my figure wants. He\r\nlooks at me with the tenderest and gentlest eyes (of a light brown) that\r\nI ever saw in the countenance of a man. His smile is rare and sweet; his\r\nmanner, perfectly quiet and retiring, has yet a latent persuasiveness in\r\nit which is (to women) irresistibly winning. He just halts a little in\r\nhis walk, from the effect of an injury received in past years, when he\r\nwas a soldier serving in India, and he carries a thick bamboo cane,\r\nwith a curious crutch handle (an old favorite), to help himself along\r\nwhenever he gets on his feet, in doors or out. With this one little\r\ndrawback (if it is a drawback), there is nothing infirm or old or\r\nawkward about him; his slight limp when he walks has (perhaps to my\r\npartial eyes) a certain quaint grace of its own, which is pleasanter to\r\nsee than the unrestrained activity of other men. And last and best\r\nof all, I love him! I love him! I love him! And there is an end of my\r\nportrait of my husband on our wedding-day.\r\n\r\nThe glass has told me all I want to know. We leave the vestry at last.\r\n\r\nThe sky, cloudy since the morning, has darkened while we have been\r\nin the church, and the rain is beginning to fall heavily. The idlers\r\noutside stare at us grimly under their umbrellas as we pass through\r\ntheir ranks and hasten into our carriage. No cheering; no sunshine; no\r\nflowers strewn in our path; no grand breakfast; no genial speeches; no\r\nbridesmaids; no fathers or mother\'s blessing. A dreary wedding--there\r\nis no denying it--and (if Aunt Starkweather is right) a bad beginning as\r\nwell!\r\n\r\nA _coup_ has been reserved for us at the railway station. The attentive\r\nporter, on the look-out for his fee pulls down the blinds over the side\r\nwindows of the carriage, and shuts out all prying eyes in that way.\r\nAfter what seems to be an interminable delay the train starts. My\r\nhusband winds his arm round me. "At last!" he whispers, with love in\r\nhis eyes that no words can utter, and presses me to him gently. My arm\r\nsteals round his neck; my eyes answer his eyes. Our lips meet in the\r\nfirst long, lingering kiss of our married life.\r\n\r\nOh, what recollections of that journey rise in me as I write! Let me dry\r\nmy eyes, and shut up my paper for the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE BRIDE\'S THOUGHTS.\r\n\r\nWE had been traveling for a little more than an hour when a change\r\npassed insensibly over us both.\r\n\r\nStill sitting close together, with my hand in his, with my head on\r\nhis shoulder, little by little we fell insensibly into silence. Had we\r\nalready exhausted the narrow yet eloquent vocabulary of love? Or had we\r\ndetermined by unexpressed consent, after enjoying the luxury of passion\r\nthat speaks, to try the deeper and finer rapture of passion that thinks?\r\nI can hardly determine; I only know that a time came when, under some\r\nstrange influence, our lips were closed toward each other. We traveled\r\nalong, each of us absorbed in our own reverie. Was he thinking\r\nexclusively of me--as I was thinking exclusively of him? Before the\r\njourney\'s end I had my doubts; at a little later time I knew for certain\r\nthat his thoughts, wandering far away from his young wife, were all\r\nturned inward on his own unhappy self.\r\n\r\nFor me the secret pleasure of filling my mind with him, while I felt him\r\nby my side, was a luxury in itself.\r\n\r\nI pictured in my thoughts our first meeting in the neighborhood of my\r\nuncle\'s house.\r\n\r\nOur famous north-country trout stream wound its flashing and foaming way\r\nthrough a ravine in the rocky moorland. It was a windy, shadowy evening.\r\nA heavily clouded sunset lay low and red in the west. A solitary angler\r\nstood casting his fly at a turn in the stream where the backwater lay\r\nstill and deep under an overhanging bank. A girl (myself) standing on\r\nthe bank, invisible to the fisherman beneath, waited eagerly to see the\r\ntrout rise.\r\n\r\nThe moment came; the fish took the fly.\r\n\r\nSometimes on the little level strip of sand at the foot of the bank,\r\nsometimes (when the stream turned again) in the shallower water rushing\r\nover its rocky bed, the angler followed the captured trout, now letting\r\nthe line run out and now winding it in again, in the difficult and\r\ndelicate process of "playing" the fish. Along the bank I followed to\r\nwatch the contest of skill and cunning between the man and the trout.\r\nI had lived long enough with my uncle Starkweather to catch some of his\r\nenthusiasm for field sports, and to learn something, especially, of the\r\nangler\'s art. Still following the stranger, with my eyes intently fixed\r\non every movement of his rod and line, and with not so much as a chance\r\nfragment of my attention to spare for the rough path along which I was\r\nwalking, I stepped by chance on the loose overhanging earth at the edge\r\nof the bank, and fell into the stream in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe distance was trifling, the water was shallow, the bed of the river\r\nwas (fortunately for me) of sand. Beyond the fright and the wetting I\r\nhad nothing to complain of. In a few moments I was out of the water and\r\nup again, very much ashamed of myself, on the firm ground. Short as the\r\ninterval was, it proved long enough to favor the escape of the fish. The\r\nangler had heard my first instinctive cry of alarm, had turned, and had\r\nthrown aside his rod to help me. We confronted each other for the\r\nfirst time, I on the bank and he in the shallow water below. Our eyes\r\nencountered, and I verily believe our hearts encountered at the same\r\nmoment. This I know for certain, we forgot our breeding as lady and\r\ngentleman: we looked at each other in barbarous silence.\r\n\r\nI was the first to recover myself. What did I say to him?\r\n\r\nI said something about my not being hurt, and then something more,\r\nurging him to run back and try if he might not yet recover the fish.\r\n\r\nHe went back unwillingly. He returned to me--of course without the fish.\r\nKnowing how bitterly disappointed my uncle would have been in his place,\r\nI apologized very earnestly. In my eagerness to make atonement, I even\r\noffered to show him a spot where he might try again, lower down the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nHe would not hear of it; he entreated me to go home and change my wet\r\ndress. I cared nothing for the wetting, but I obeyed him without knowing\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nHe walked with me. My way back to the Vicarage was his way back to the\r\ninn. He had come to our parts, he told me, for the quiet and retirement\r\nas much as for the fishing. He had noticed me once or twice from the\r\nwindow of his room at the inn. He asked if I were not the vicar\'s\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nI set him right. I told him that the vicar had married my mother\'s\r\nsister, and that the two had been father and mother to me since the\r\ndeath of my parents. He asked if he might venture to call on Doctor\r\nStarkweather the next day, mentioning the name of a friend of his, with\r\nwhom he believed the vicar to be acquainted. I invited him to visit us,\r\nas if it had been my house; I was spell-bound under his eyes and under\r\nhis voice. I had fancied, honestly fancied, myself to have been in love\r\noften and often before this time. Never in any other man\'s company had\r\nI felt as I now felt in the presence of _this_ man. Night seemed to fall\r\nsuddenly over the evening landscape when he left me. I leaned against\r\nthe Vicarage gate. I could not breathe, I could not think; my heart\r\nfluttered as if it would fly out of my bosom--and all this for a\r\nstranger! I burned with shame; but oh, in spite of it all, I was so\r\nhappy!\r\n\r\nAnd now, when little more than a few weeks had passed since that first\r\nmeeting, I had him by my side; he was mine for life! I lifted my head\r\nfrom his bosom to look at him. I was like a child with a new toy--I\r\nwanted to make sure that he was really my own.\r\n\r\nHe never noticed the action; he never moved in his corner of the\r\ncarriage. Was he deep in his own thoughts? and were they thoughts of Me?\r\n\r\nI laid down my head again softly, so as not to disturb him. My thoughts\r\nwandered backward once more, and showed me another picture in the golden\r\ngallery of the past.\r\n\r\nThe garden at the Vicarage formed the new scene. The time was night. We\r\nhad met together in secret. We were walking slowly to and fro, out of\r\nsight of the house, now in the shadowy paths of the shrubbery, now in\r\nthe lovely moonlight on the open lawn.\r\n\r\nWe had long since owned our love and devoted our lives to each other.\r\nAlready our interests were one; already we shared the pleasures and the\r\npains of life. I had gone out to meet him that night with a heavy heart,\r\nto seek comfort in his presence and to find encouragement in his voice.\r\nHe noticed that I sighed when he first took me in his arms, and he\r\ngently turned my head toward the moonlight to read my trouble in my\r\nface. How often he had read my happiness there in the earlier days of\r\nour love!\r\n\r\n"You bring bad news, my angel," he said, lifting my hair tenderly from\r\nmy forehead as he spoke. "I see the lines here which tell me of anxiety\r\nand distress. I almost wish I loved you less dearly, Valeria."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I might give you back your freedom. I have only to leave this place,\r\nand your uncle would be satisfied, and you would be relieved from all\r\nthe cares that are pressing on you now."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of it, Eustace! If you want me to forget my cares, say you\r\nlove me more dearly than ever."\r\n\r\nHe said it in a kiss. We had a moment of exquisite forgetfulness of the\r\nhard ways of life--a moment of delicious absorption in each other. I\r\ncame back to realities fortified and composed, rewarded for all that\r\nI had gone through, ready to go through it all over again for another\r\nkiss. Only give a woman love, and there is nothing she will not venture,\r\nsuffer, and do.\r\n\r\n"No, they have done with objecting. They have remembered at last that\r\nI am of age, and that I can choose for myself. They have been pleading\r\nwith me, Eustace, to give you up. My aunt, whom I thought rather a hard\r\nwoman, has been crying--for the first time in my experience of her. My\r\nuncle, always kind and good to me, has been kinder and better than ever.\r\nHe has told me that if I persist in becoming your wife, I shall not be\r\ndeserted on my wedding-day. Wherever we may marry, he will be there\r\nto read the service, and my aunt will go to the church with me. But\r\nhe entreats me to consider seriously what I am doing--to consent to a\r\nseparation from you for a time--to consult other people on my position\r\ntoward you, if I am not satisfied with his opinion. Oh, my darling, they\r\nare as anxious to part us as if you were the worst instead of the best\r\nof men!"\r\n\r\n"Has anything happened since yesterday to increase their distrust of\r\nme?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"You remember referring my uncle to a friend of yours and of his?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. To Major Fitz-David."\r\n\r\n"My uncle has written to Major Fitz-David."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\nHe pronounced that one word in a tone so utterly unlike his natural tone\r\nthat his voice sounded quite strange to me.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t be angry, Eustace, if I tell you?" I said. "My uncle, as I\r\nunderstood him, had several motives for writing to the major. One of\r\nthem was to inquire if he knew your mother\'s address."\r\n\r\nEustace suddenly stood still.\r\n\r\nI paused at the same moment, feeling that I could venture no further\r\nwithout the risk of offending him.\r\n\r\nTo speak the truth, his conduct, when he first mentioned our engagement\r\nto my uncle, had been (so far as appearances went) a little flighty and\r\nstrange. The vicar had naturally questioned him about his family. He had\r\nanswered that his father was dead; and he had consented, though not very\r\nreadily, to announce his contemplated marriage to his mother. Informing\r\nus that she too lived in the country, he had gone to see her, without\r\nmore particularly mentioning her address. In two days he had returned\r\nto the Vicarage with a very startling message. His mother intended no\r\ndisrespect to me or my relatives, but she disapproved so absolutely\r\nof her son\'s marriage that she (and the members of her family, who all\r\nagreed with her) would refuse to be present at the ceremony, if Mr.\r\nWoodville persisted in keeping his engagement with Dr. Starkweather\'s\r\nniece. Being asked to explain this extraordinary communication, Eustace\r\nhad told us that his mother and his sisters were bent on his marrying\r\nanother lady, and that they were bitterly mortified and disappointed by\r\nhis choosing a stranger to the family. This explanation was enough for\r\nme; it implied, so far as I was concerned, a compliment to my superior\r\ninfluence over Eustace, which a woman always receives with pleasure. But\r\nit failed to satisfy my uncle and my aunt. The vicar expressed to Mr.\r\nWoodville a wish to write to his mother, or to see her, on the subject\r\nof her strange message. Eustace obstinately declined to mention his\r\nmother\'s address, on the ground that the vicar\'s interference would be\r\nutterly useless. My uncle at once drew the conclusion that the mystery\r\nabout the address indicated something wrong. He refused to favor Mr.\r\nWoodville\'s renewed proposal for my hand, and he wrote the same day to\r\nmake inquiries of Mr. Woodville\'s reference and of his own friend Major\r\nFitz-David.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances as these, to speak of my uncle\'s motives was\r\nto venture on very delicate ground. Eustace relieved me from further\r\nembarrassment by asking a question to which I could easily reply.\r\n\r\n"Has your uncle received any answer from Major Fitz-David?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes.\r\n\r\n"Were you allowed to read it?" His voice sank as he said those words;\r\nhis face betrayed a sudden anxiety which it pained me to see.\r\n\r\n"I have got the answer with me to show you," I said.\r\n\r\nHe almost snatched the letter out of my hand; he turned his back on me\r\nto read it by the light of the moon. The letter was short enough to be\r\nsoon read. I could have repeated it at the time. I can repeat it now.\r\n\r\n"DEAR VICAR--Mr. Eustace Woodville is quite correct in stating to you\r\nthat he is a gentleman by birth and position, and that he inherits\r\n(under his deceased father\'s will) an independent fortune of two\r\nthousand a year.\r\n\r\n                               "Always yours,\r\n\r\n                               "LAWRENCE FITZ-DAVID."\r\n\r\n"Can anybody wish for a plainer answer than that?" Eustace asked,\r\nhanding the letter back to me.\r\n\r\n"If _I_ had written for information about you," I answered, "it would\r\nhave been plain enough for me."\r\n\r\n"Is it not plain enough for your uncle?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"What does he say?"\r\n\r\n"Why need you care to know, my darling?"\r\n\r\n"I want to know, Valeria. There must be no secret between us in this\r\nmatter. Did your uncle say anything when he showed you the major\'s\r\nletter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What was it?"\r\n\r\n"My uncle told me that his letter of inquiry filled three pages, and he\r\nbade me observe that the major\'s answer contained one sentence only. He\r\nsaid, \'I volunteered to go to Major Fitz-David and talk the matter over.\r\nYou see he takes no notice of my proposal. I asked him for the address\r\nof Mr. Woodville\'s mother. He passes over my request, as he has passed\r\nover my proposal--he studiously confines himself to the shortest\r\npossible statement of bare facts. Use your common-sense, Valeria. Isn\'t\r\nthis rudeness rather remarkable on the part of a man who is a gentleman\r\nby birth and breeding, and who is also a friend of mine?\'"\r\n\r\nEustace stopped me there.\r\n\r\n"Did you answer your uncle\'s question?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No," I replied. "I only said that I did not understand the major\'s\r\nconduct."\r\n\r\n"And what did your uncle say next? If you love me, Valeria, tell me the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"He used very strong language, Eustace. He is an old man; you must not\r\nbe offended with him."\r\n\r\n"I am not offended. What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He said, \'Mark my words! There is something under the surface in\r\nconnection with Mr. Woodville, or with his family, to which Major\r\nFitz-David is not at liberty to allude. Properly interpreted, Valeria,\r\nthat letter is a warning. Show it to Mr. Woodville, and tell him (if you\r\nlike) what I have just told you--\'"\r\n\r\nEustace stopped me again.\r\n\r\n"You are sure your uncle said those words?" he asked, scanning my face\r\nattentively in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n"Quite sure. But I don\'t say what my uncle says. Pray don\'t think that!"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly pressed me to his bosom, and fixed his eyes on mine. His\r\nlook frightened me.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Valeria!" he said. "Try and think kindly of me, my darling,\r\nwhen you are married to some happier man."\r\n\r\nHe attempted to leave me. I clung to him in an agony of terror that\r\nshook me from head to foot.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" I asked, as soon as I could speak. "I am yours\r\nand yours only. What have I said, what have I done, to deserve those\r\ndreadful words?"\r\n\r\n"We must part, my angel," he answered, sadly. "The fault is none of\r\nyours; the misfortune is all mine. My Valeria! how can you marry a man\r\nwho is an object of suspicion to your nearest and dearest friends?\r\nI have led a dreary life. I have never found in any other woman the\r\nsympathy with me, the sweet comfort and companionship, that I find\r\nin you. Oh, it is hard to lose you! it is hard to go back again to my\r\nunfriended life! I must make the sacrifice, love, for your sake. I\r\nknow no more why that letter is what it is than you do. Will your\r\nuncle believe me? will your friends believe me? One last kiss, Valeria!\r\nForgive me for having loved you--passionately, devotedly loved you.\r\nForgive me--and let me go!"\r\n\r\nI held him desperately, recklessly. His eyes, put me beside myself; his\r\nwords filled me with a frenzy of despair.\r\n\r\n"Go where you may," I said, "I go with you! Friends--reputation--I\r\ncare nothing who I lose, or what I lose! Oh, Eustace, I am only a\r\nwoman--don\'t madden me! I can\'t live without you. I must and will be\r\nyour wife!"\r\n\r\nThose wild words were all I could say before the misery and madness in\r\nme forced their way outward in a burst of sobs and tears.\r\n\r\nHe yielded. He soothed me with his charming voice; he brought me back to\r\nmyself with his tender caresses. He called the bright heaven above us\r\nto witness that he devoted his whole life to me. He vowed--oh, in such\r\nsolemn, such eloquent words!--that his one thought, night and day,\r\nshould be to prove himself worthy of such love as mine. And had he not\r\nnobly redeemed the pledge? Had not the betrothal of that memorable night\r\nbeen followed by the betrothal at the altar, by the vows before God! Ah,\r\nwhat a life was before me! What more than mortal happiness was mine!\r\n\r\nAgain I lifted my head from his bosom to taste the dear delight of\r\nseeing him by my side--my life, my love, my husband, my own!\r\n\r\nHardly awakened yet from the absorbing memories of the past to the sweet\r\nrealities of the present, I let my cheek touch his cheek, I whispered to\r\nhim softly, "Oh, how I love you! how I love you!"\r\n\r\nThe next instant I started back from him. My heart stood still. I put\r\nmy hand up to my face. What did I feel on my cheek? (_I_ had not been\r\nweeping--I was too happy.) What did I feel on my cheek? A tear!\r\n\r\nHis face was still averted from me. I turned it toward me, with my own\r\nhands, by main force.\r\n\r\nI looked at him--and saw my husband, on our wedding-day, with his eyes\r\nfull of tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. RAMSGATE SANDS.\r\n\r\nEUSTACE succeeded in quieting my alarm. But I can hardly say that he\r\nsucceeded in satisfying my mind as well.\r\n\r\nHe had been thinking, he told me, of the contrast between his past and\r\nhis present life. Bitter remembrance of the years that had gone had\r\nrisen in his memory, and had filled him with melancholy misgivings of\r\nhis capacity to make my life with him a happy one. He had asked himself\r\nif he had not met me too late--if he were not already a man soured and\r\nbroken by the disappointments and disenchantments of the past? Doubts\r\nsuch as these, weighing more and more heavily on his mind, had filled\r\nhis eyes with the tears which I had discovered--tears which he now\r\nentreated me, by my love for him, to dismiss from my memory forever.\r\n\r\nI forgave him, comforted him, revived him; but there were moments when\r\nthe remembrance of what I had seen troubled me in secret, and when I\r\nasked myself if I really possessed my husband\'s full confidence as he\r\npossessed mine.\r\n\r\nWe left the train at Ramsgate.\r\n\r\nThe favorite watering-place was empty; the season was just over. Our\r\narrangements for the wedding tour included a cruise to the Mediterranean\r\nin a yacht lent to Eustace by a friend. We were both fond of the sea,\r\nand we were equally desirous, considering the circumstances under which\r\nwe had married, of escaping the notice of friends and acquaintances.\r\nWith this object in view, having celebrated our marriage privately in\r\nLondon, we had decided on instructing the sailing-master of the yacht to\r\njoin us at Ramsgate. At this port (when the season for visitors was at\r\nan end) we could embark far more privately than at the popular yachting\r\nstations situated in the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nThree days passed--days of delicious solitude, of exquisite happiness,\r\nnever to be forgotten, never to be lived over again, to the end of our\r\nlives!\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the fourth day, just before sunrise, a trifling\r\nincident happened, which was noticeable, nevertheless, as being strange\r\nto me in my experience of myself.\r\n\r\nI awoke, suddenly and unaccountably, from a deep and dreamless sleep\r\nwith an all-pervading sensation of nervous uneasiness which I had never\r\nfelt before. In the old days at the Vicarage my capacity as a sound\r\nsleeper had been the subject of many a little harmless joke. From the\r\nmoment when my head was on the pillow I had never known what it was to\r\nawake until the maid knocked at my door. At all seasons and times the\r\nlong and uninterrupted repose of a child was the repose that I enjoyed.\r\n\r\nAnd now I had awakened, without any assignable cause, hours before my\r\nusual time. I tried to compose myself to sleep again. The effort was\r\nuseless. Such a restlessness possessed me that I was not even able to\r\nlie still in the bed. My husband was sleeping soundly by my side. In the\r\nfear of disturbing him I rose, and put on my dressing-gown and slippers.\r\n\r\nI went to the window. The sun was just rising over the calm gray sea.\r\nFor a while the majestic spectacle before me exercised a tranquilizing\r\ninfluence on the irritable condition of my nerves. But ere long the old\r\nrestlessness returned upon me. I walked slowly to and fro in the room,\r\nuntil I was weary of the monotony of the exercise. I took up a book, and\r\nlaid it aside again. My attention wandered; the author was powerless\r\nto recall it. I got on my feet once more, and looked at Eustace, and\r\nadmired him and loved him in his tranquil sleep. I went back to the\r\nwindow, and wearied of the beautiful morning. I sat down before the\r\nglass and looked at myself. How haggard and worn I was already, through\r\nawaking before my usual time! I rose again, not knowing what to do next.\r\nThe confinement to the four walls of the room began to be intolerable\r\nto me. I opened the door that led into my husband\'s dressing-room, and\r\nentered it, to try if the change would relieve me.\r\n\r\nThe first object that I noticed was his dressing-case, open on the\r\ntoilet-table.\r\n\r\nI took out the bottles and pots and brushes and combs, the knives and\r\nscissors in one compartment, the writing materials in another. I smelled\r\nthe perfumes and pomatums; I busily cleaned and dusted the bottles\r\nwith my handkerchief as I took them out. Little by little I completely\r\nemptied the dressing-case. It was lined with blue velvet. In one corner\r\nI noticed a tiny slip of loose blue silk. Taking it between my finger\r\nand thumb, and drawing it upward, I discovered that there was a false\r\nbottom to the case, forming a secret compartment for letters and papers.\r\nIn my strange condition--capricious, idle, inquisitive--it was an\r\namusement to me to take out the papers, just as I had taken out\r\neverything else.\r\n\r\nI found some receipted bills, which failed to interest me; some letters,\r\nwhich it is needless to say I laid aside after only looking at the\r\naddresses; and, under all, a photograph, face downward, with writing on\r\nthe back of it. I looked at the writing, and saw these words:\r\n\r\n"To my dear son, Eustace."\r\n\r\nHis mother! the woman who had so obstinately and mercilessly opposed\r\nherself to our marriage!\r\n\r\nI eagerly turned the photograph, expecting to see a woman with a stern,\r\nill-tempered, forbidding countenance. To my surprise, the face showed\r\nthe remains of great beauty; the expression, though remarkably firm,\r\nwas yet winning, tender, and kind. The gray hair was arranged in rows\r\nof little quaint old-fashioned curls on either side of the head, under a\r\nplain lace cap. At one corner of the mouth there was a mark, apparently\r\na mole, which added to the characteristic peculiarity of the face.\r\nI looked and looked, fixing the portrait thoroughly in my mind. This\r\nwoman, who had almost insulted me and my relatives, was, beyond all\r\ndoubt or dispute, so far as appearances went, a person possessing\r\nunusual attractions--a person whom it would be a pleasure and a\r\nprivilege to know.\r\n\r\nI fell into deep thought. The discovery of the photograph quieted me as\r\nnothing had quieted me yet.\r\n\r\nThe striking of a clock downstairs in the hall warned me of the flight\r\nof time. I carefully put back all the objects in the dressing-case\r\n(beginning with the photograph) exactly as I had found them, and\r\nreturned to the bedroom. As I looked at my husband, still sleeping\r\npeacefully, the question forced itself into my mind, What had made that\r\ngenial, gentle mother of his so sternly bent on parting us? so harshly\r\nand pitilessly resolute in asserting her disapproval of our marriage?\r\n\r\nCould I put my question openly to Eustace when he awoke? No; I was\r\nafraid to venture that length. It had been tacitly understood between us\r\nthat we were not to speak of his mother--and, besides, he might be\r\nangry if he knew that I had opened the private compartment of his\r\ndressing-case.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast that morning we had news at last of the yacht. The\r\nvessel was safely moored in the inner harbor, and the sailing-master was\r\nwaiting to receive my husband\'s orders on board.\r\n\r\nEustace hesitated at asking me to accompany him to the yacht. It would\r\nbe necessary for him to examine the inventory of the vessel, and to\r\ndecide questions, not very interesting to a woman, relating to charts\r\nand barometers, provisions and water. He asked me if I would wait for\r\nhis return. The day was enticingly beautiful, and the tide was on\r\nthe ebb. I pleaded for a walk on the sands; and the landlady at our\r\nlodgings, who happened to be in the room at the time, volunteered to\r\naccompany me and take care of me. It was agreed that we should walk\r\nas far as we felt inclined in the direction of Broadstairs, and that\r\nEustace should follow and meet us on the sands, after having completed\r\nhis arrangements on board the yacht.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour more the landlady and I were out on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe scene on that fine autumn morning was nothing less than enchanting.\r\nThe brisk breeze, the brilliant sky, the flashing blue sea, the\r\nsun-bright cliffs and the tawny sands at their feet, the gliding\r\nprocession of ships on the great marine highway of the English\r\nChannel--it was all so exhilarating, it was all so delightful, that I\r\nreally believe if I had been by myself I could have danced for joy like\r\na child. The one drawback to my happiness was the landlady\'s untiring\r\ntongue. She was a forward, good-natured, empty-headed woman, who\r\npersisted in talking, whether I listened or not, and who had a habit of\r\nperpetually addressing me as "Mrs. Woodville," which I thought a little\r\noverfamiliar as an assertion of equality from a person in her position\r\nto a person in mine.\r\n\r\nWe had been out, I should think, more than half an hour, when we\r\novertook a lady walking before us on the beach.\r\n\r\nJust as we were about to pass the stranger she took her handkerchief\r\nfrom her pocket, and accidentally drew out with it a letter, which fell\r\nunnoticed by her, on the sand. I was nearest to the letter, and I picked\r\nit up and offered it to the lady.\r\n\r\nThe instant she turned to thank me, I stood rooted to the spot. There\r\nwas the original of the photographic portrait in the dressing-case!\r\nthere was my husband\'s mother, standing face to face with me! I\r\nrecognized the quaint little gray curls, the gentle, genial expression,\r\nthe mole at the corner of the mouth. No mistake was possible. His mother\r\nherself!\r\n\r\nThe old lady, naturally enough, mistook my confusion for shyness. With\r\nperfect tact and kindness she entered into conversation with me. In\r\nanother minute I was walking side by side with the woman who had sternly\r\nrepudiated me as a member of her family; feeling, I own, terribly\r\ndiscomposed, and not knowing in the least whether I ought or ought not\r\nto assume the responsibility, in my husband\'s absence, of telling her\r\nwho I was.\r\n\r\nIn another minute my familiar landlady, walking on the other side of\r\nmy mother-in-law, decided the question for me. I happened to say that\r\nI supposed we must by that time be near the end of our walk--the little\r\nwatering-place called Broadstairs. "Oh no, Mrs. Woodville!" cried the\r\nirrepressible woman, calling me by my name, as usual; "nothing like so\r\nnear as you think!"\r\n\r\nI looked with a beating heart at the old lady.\r\n\r\nTo my unutterable amazement, not the faintest gleam of recognition\r\nappeared in her face. Old Mrs. Woodville went on talking to young Mrs.\r\nWoodville just as composedly as if she had never heard her own name\r\nbefore in her life!\r\n\r\nMy face and manner must have betrayed something of the agitation that I\r\nwas suffering. Happening to look at me at the end of her next sentence,\r\nthe old lady started, and said, in her kindly way,\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you have overexerted yourself. You are very pale--you are\r\nlooking quite exhausted. Come and sit down here; let me lend you my\r\nsmelling-bottle."\r\n\r\nI followed her, quite helplessly, to the base of the cliff. Some fallen\r\nfragments of chalk offered us a seat. I vaguely heard the voluble\r\nlandlady\'s expressions of sympathy and regret; I mechanically took the\r\nsmelling-bottle which my husband\'s mother offered to me, after hearing\r\nmy name, as an act of kindness to a stranger.\r\n\r\nIf I had only had myself to think of, I believe I should have provoked\r\nan explanation on the spot. But I had Eustace to think of. I was\r\nentirely ignorant of the relations, hostile or friendly, which existed\r\nbetween his mother and himself. What could I do?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the old lady was still speaking to me with the most\r\nconsiderate sympathy. She too was fatigued, she said. She had passed a\r\nweary night at the bedside of a near relative staying at Ramsgate. Only\r\nthe day before she had received a telegram announcing that one of her\r\nsisters was seriously ill. She was herself thank God, still active and\r\nstrong, and she had thought it her duty to start at once for Ramsgate.\r\nToward the morning the state of the patient had improved. "The doctor\r\nassures me ma\'am, that there is no immediate danger; and I thought it\r\nmight revive me, after my long night at the bedside, if I took a little\r\nwalk on the beach."\r\n\r\nI heard the words--I understood what they meant--but I was still too\r\nbewildered and too intimidated by my extraordinary position to be able\r\nto continue the conversation. The landlady had a sensible suggestion to\r\nmake--the landlady was the next person who spoke.\r\n\r\n"Here is a gentleman coming," she said to me, pointing in the direction\r\nof Ramsgate. "You can never walk back. Shall we ask him to send a chaise\r\nfrom Broadstairs to the gap in the cliff?"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman advanced a little nearer.\r\n\r\nThe landlady and I recognized him at the same moment. It was Eustace\r\ncoming to meet us, as we had arranged. The irrepressible landlady gave\r\nthe freest expression to her feelings. "Oh, Mrs. Woodville, ain\'t it\r\nlucky? here is Mr. Woodville himself."\r\n\r\nOnce more I looked at my mother-in-law. Once more the name failed to\r\nproduce the slightest effect on her. Her sight was not so keen as ours;\r\nshe had not recognized her son yet. He had young eyes like us, and\r\nhe recognized his mother. For a moment he stopped like a man\r\nthunderstruck. Then he came on--his ruddy face white with suppressed\r\nemotion, his eyes fixed on his mother.\r\n\r\n"You here!" he said to her.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Eustace?" she quietly rejoined. "Have _you_ heard of\r\nyour aunt\'s illness too? Did you know she was staying at Ramsgate?"\r\n\r\nHe made no answer. The landlady, drawing the inevitable inference from\r\nthe words that she had just heard, looked from me to my mother-in-law in\r\na state of amazement, which paralyzed even her tongue. I waited with\r\nmy eyes on my husband, to see what he would do. If he had delayed\r\nacknowledging me another moment, the whole future course of my life\r\nmight have been altered--I should have despised him.\r\n\r\nHe did _not_ delay. He came to my side and took my hand.\r\n\r\n"Do you know who this is?" he said to his mother.\r\n\r\nShe answered, looking at me with a courteous bend of her head:\r\n\r\n"A lady I met on the beach, Eustace, who kindly restored to me a letter\r\nthat I dropped. I think I heard the name" (she turned to the landlady):\r\n"Mrs. Woodville, was it not?"\r\n\r\nMy husband\'s fingers unconsciously closed on my hand with a grasp that\r\nhurt me. He set his mother right, it is only just to say, without one\r\ncowardly moment of hesitation.\r\n\r\n"Mother," he said to her, very quietly, "this lady is my wife."\r\n\r\nShe had hitherto kept her seat. She now rose slowly and faced her son in\r\nsilence. The first expression of surprise passed from her face. It was\r\nsucceeded by the most terrible look of mingled indignation and contempt\r\nthat I ever saw in a woman\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"I pity your wife," she said.\r\n\r\nWith those words and no more, lifting her hand she waved him back from\r\nher, and went on her way again, as we had first found her, alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. ON THE WAY HOME.\r\n\r\nLEFT by ourselves, there was a moment of silence among us. Eustace spoke\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n"Are you able to walk back?" he said to me. "Or shall we go on to\r\nBroadstairs, and return to Ramsgate by the railway?"\r\n\r\nHe put those questions as composedly, so far as his manner was\r\nconcerned, as if nothing remarkable had happened. But his eyes and his\r\nlips betrayed him. They told me that he was suffering keenly in secret.\r\nThe extraordinary scene that had just passed, far from depriving me of\r\nthe last remains of my courage, had strung up my nerves and restored\r\nmy self-possession. I must have been more or less than woman if my\r\nself-respect had not been wounded, if my curiosity had not been wrought\r\nto the highest pitch, by the extraordinary conduct of my husband\'s\r\nmother when Eustace presented me to her. What was the secret of\r\nher despising him, and pitying me? Where was the explanation of her\r\nincomprehensible apathy when my name was twice pronounced in her\r\nhearing? Why had she left us, as if the bare idea of remaining in our\r\ncompany was abhorrent to her? The foremost interest of my life was now\r\nthe interest of penetrating these mysteries. Walk? I was in such a fever\r\nof expectation that I felt as if I could have walked to the world\'s end,\r\nif I could only keep my husband by my side, and question him on the way.\r\n\r\n"I am quite recovered," I said. "Let us go back, as we came, on foot."\r\n\r\nEustace glanced at the landlady. The landlady understood him.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t intrude my company on you, sir," she said, sharply. "I have\r\nsome business to do at Broadstairs, and, now I am so near, I may as well\r\ngo on. Good-morning, Mrs. Woodville."\r\n\r\nShe laid a marked emphasis on my name, and she added one significant\r\nlook at parting, which (in the preoccupied state of my mind at that\r\nmoment) I entirely failed to comprehend. There was neither time\r\nnor opportunity to ask her what she meant. With a stiff little bow,\r\naddressed to Eustace, she left us as his mother had left us taking the\r\nway to Broadstairs, and walking rapidly.\r\n\r\nAt last we were alone.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in beginning my inquiries; I wasted no words in prefatory\r\nphrases. In the plainest terms I put the question to him:\r\n\r\n"What does your mother\'s conduct mean?"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, he burst into a fit of laughter--loud, coarse,\r\nhard laughter, so utterly unlike any sound I had ever yet heard issue\r\nfrom his lips, so strangely and shockingly foreign to his character\r\nas _I_ understood it, that I stood still on the sands and openly\r\nremonstrated with him.\r\n\r\n"Eustace! you are not like yourself," I said. "You almost frighten me."\r\n\r\nHe took no notice. He seemed to be pursuing some pleasant train of\r\nthought just started in his mind.\r\n\r\n"So like my mother!" he exclaimed, with the air of a man who felt\r\nirresistibly diverted by some humorous idea of his own. "Tell me all\r\nabout it, Valeria!"\r\n\r\n"Tell _you_!" I repeated. "After what has happened, surely it is your\r\nduty to enlighten _me_."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t see the joke," he said.\r\n\r\n"I not only fail to see the joke," I rejoined, "I see something in\r\nyour mother\'s language and your mother\'s behavior which justifies me in\r\nasking you for a serious explanation."\r\n\r\n"My dear Valeria, if you understood my mother as well as I do, a serious\r\nexplanation of her conduct would be the last thing in the world that you\r\nwould expect from me. The idea of taking my mother seriously!" He burst\r\nout laughing again. "My darling, you don\'t know how you amuse me."\r\n\r\nIt was all forced: it was all unnatural. He, the most delicate, the most\r\nrefined of men--a gentleman in the highest sense of the word--was coarse\r\nand loud and vulgar! My heart sank under a sudden sense of misgiving\r\nwhich, with all my love for him, it was impossible to resist. In\r\nunutterable distress and alarm I asked myself, "Is my husband beginning\r\nto deceive me? is he acting a part, and acting it badly, before we have\r\nbeen married a week?" I set myself to win his confidence in a new way.\r\nHe was evidently determined to force his own point of view on me. I\r\ndetermined, on my side, to accept his point of view.\r\n\r\n"You tell me I don\'t understand your mother," I said, gently. "Will you\r\nhelp me to understand her?"\r\n\r\n"It is not easy to help you to understand a woman who doesn\'t understand\r\nherself," he answered. "But I will try. The key to my poor dear mother\'s\r\ncharacter is, in one word--Eccentricity."\r\n\r\nIf he had picked out the most inappropriate word in the whole dictionary\r\nto describe the lady whom I had met on the beach, "Eccentricity" would\r\nhave been that word. A child who had seen what I saw, who had heard what\r\nI heard would have discovered that he was trifling--grossly, recklessly\r\ntrifling--with the truth.\r\n\r\n"Bear in mind what I have said," he proceeded; "and if you want to\r\nunderstand my mother, do what I asked you to do a minute since--tell me\r\nall about it. How came you to speak to her, to begin with?"\r\n\r\n"Your mother told you, Eustace. I was walking just behind her, when she\r\ndropped a letter by accident--"\r\n\r\n"No accident," he interposed. "The letter was dropped on purpose."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" I exclaimed. "Why should your mother drop the letter on\r\npurpose?"\r\n\r\n"Use the key to her character, my dear. Eccentricity! My mother\'s odd\r\nway of making acquaintance with you."\r\n\r\n"Making acquaintance with me? I have just told you that I was walking\r\nbehind her. She could not have known of the existence of such a person\r\nas myself until I spoke to her first."\r\n\r\n"So you suppose, Valeria."\r\n\r\n"I am certain of it."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me--you don\'t know my mother as I do."\r\n\r\nI began to lose all patience with him.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me," I said, "that your mother was out on the sands\r\nto-day for the express purpose of making acquaintance with Me?"\r\n\r\n"I have not the slightest doubt of it," he answered, coolly.\r\n\r\n"Why, she didn\'t even recognize my name!" I burst out. "Twice over the\r\nlandlady called me Mrs. Woodville in your mother\'s hearing, and twice\r\nover, I declare to you on my word of honor, it failed to produce the\r\nslightest impression on her. She looked and acted as if she had never\r\nheard her own name before in her life."\r\n\r\n"\'Acted\' is the right word," he said, just as composedly as before.\r\n"The women on the stage are not the only women who can act. My mother\'s\r\nobject was to make herself thoroughly acquainted with you, and to throw\r\nyou off your guard by speaking in the character of a stranger. It is\r\nexactly like her to take that roundabout way of satisfying her curiosity\r\nabout a daughter-in-law she disapproves of. If I had not joined you when\r\nI did, you would have been examined and cross-examined about yourself\r\nand about me, and you would innocently have answered under the\r\nimpression that you were speaking to a chance acquaintance. There is my\r\nmother all over! She is your enemy, remember--not your friend. She is\r\nnot in search of your merits, but of your faults. And you wonder why\r\nno impression was produced on her when she heard you addressed by your\r\nname! Poor innocent! I can tell you this--you only discovered my\r\nmother in her own character when I put an end to the mystification by\r\npresenting you to each other. You saw how angry she was, and now you\r\nknow why."\r\n\r\nI let him go on without saying a word. I listened--oh! with such a heavy\r\nheart, with such a crushing sense of disenchantment and despair! The\r\nidol of my worship, the companion, guide, protector of my life--had he\r\nfallen so low? could he stoop to such shameless prevarication as this?\r\n\r\nWas there one word of truth in all that he had said to me? Yes! If I\r\nhad not discovered his mother\'s portrait, it was certainly true that I\r\nshould not have known, not even have vaguely suspected, who she really\r\nwas. Apart from this, the rest was lying, clumsy lying, which said one\r\nthing at least for him, that he was not accustomed to falsehood and\r\ndeceit. Good Heavens! if my husband was to be believed, his mother must\r\nhave tracked us to London, tracked us to the church, tracked us to the\r\nrailway station, tracked us to Ramsgate! To assert that she knew me by\r\nsight as the wife of Eustace, and that she had waited on the sands and\r\ndropped her letter for the express purpose of making acquaintance with\r\nme, was also to assert every one of these monstrous probabilities to be\r\nfacts that had actually happened!\r\n\r\nI could say no more. I walked by his side in silence, feeling the\r\nmiserable conviction that there was an abyss in the shape of a family\r\nsecret between my husband and me. In the spirit, if not in the body, we\r\nwere separated, after a married life of barely four days.\r\n\r\n"Valeria," he asked, "have you nothing to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Are you not satisfied with my explanation?"\r\n\r\nI detected a slight tremor in his voice as he put that question. The\r\ntone was, for the first time since we had spoken together, a tone that\r\nmy experience associated with him in certain moods of his which I had\r\nalready learned to know well. Among the hundred thousand mysterious\r\ninfluences which a man exercises over a woman who loves him, I doubt if\r\nthere is any more irresistible to her than the influence of his voice. I\r\nam not one of those women who shed tears on the smallest provocation:\r\nit is not in my temperament, I suppose. But when I heard that little\r\nnatural change in his tone my mind went back (I can\'t say why) to the\r\nhappy day when I first owned that I loved him. I burst out crying.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly stood still, and took me by the hand. He tried to look at\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI kept my head down and my eyes on the ground. I was ashamed of my\r\nweakness and my want of spirit. I was determined not to look at him.\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed he suddenly dropped on his knees at my\r\nfeet, with a cry of despair that cut through me like a knife.\r\n\r\n"Valeria! I am vile--I am false--I am unworthy of you. Don\'t believe\r\na word of what I have been saying--lies, lies, cowardly, contemptible\r\nlies! You don\'t know what I have gone through; you don\'t know how I have\r\nbeen tortured. Oh, my darling, try not to despise me! I must have been\r\nbeside myself when I spoke to you as I did. You looked hurt; you\r\nlooked offended; I didn\'t know what to do. I wanted to spare you even a\r\nmoment\'s pain--I wanted to hush it up, and have done with it. For\r\nGod\'s sake don\'t ask me to tell you any more! My love! my angel! it\'s\r\nsomething between my mother and me; it\'s nothing that need disturb you;\r\nit\'s nothing to anybody now. I love you, I adore you; my whole heart and\r\nsoul are yours. Be satisfied with that. Forget what has happened. You\r\nshall never see my mother again. We will leave this place to-morrow. We\r\nwill go away in the yacht. Does it matter where we live, so long as we\r\nlive for each other? Forgive and forget! Oh, Valeria, Valeria, forgive\r\nand forget!"\r\n\r\nUnutterable misery was in his face; unutterable misery was in his voice.\r\nRemember this. And remember that I loved him.\r\n\r\n"It is easy to forgive," I said, sadly. "For your sake, Eustace, I will\r\ntry to forget."\r\n\r\nI raised him gently as I spoke. He kissed my hands with the air of a\r\nman who was too humble to venture on any more familiar expression of his\r\ngratitude than that. The sense of embarrassment between us as we slowly\r\nwalked on again was so unendurable that I actually cast about in my\r\nmind for a subject of conversation, as if I had been in the company of a\r\nstranger! In mercy to _him_, I asked him to tell me about the yacht.\r\n\r\nHe seized on the subject as a drowning man seizes on the hand that\r\nrescues him.\r\n\r\nOn that one poor little topic of the yacht he talked, talked, talked,\r\nas if his life depended upon his not being silent for an instant on\r\nthe rest of the way back. To me it was dreadful to hear him. I could\r\nestimate what he was suffering by the violence which he--ordinarily a\r\nsilent and thoughtful man--was now doing to his true nature, and to\r\nthe prejudices and habits of his life. With the greatest difficulty I\r\npreserved my self-control until we reached the door of our lodgings.\r\nThere I was obliged to plead fatigue, and ask him to let me rest for a\r\nlittle while in the solitude of my own room.\r\n\r\n"Shall we sail to-morrow?" he called after me suddenly, as I ascended\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\nSail with him to the Mediterranean the next day? Pass weeks and weeks\r\nabsolutely alone with him, in the narrow limits of a vessel, with his\r\nhorrible secret parting us in sympathy further and further from each\r\nother day by day? I shuddered at the thought of it.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow is rather a short notice," I said. "Will you give me a little\r\nlonger time to prepare for the voyage?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes--take any time you like," he answered, not (as I thought) very\r\nwillingly. "While you are resting--there are still one or two little\r\nthings to be settled--I think I will go back to the yacht. Is there\r\nanything I can do for you, Valeria, before I go?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing--thank you, Eustace."\r\n\r\nHe hastened away to the harbor. Was he afraid of his own thoughts, if he\r\nwere left by himself in the house. Was the company of the sailing-master\r\nand the steward better than no company at all?\r\n\r\nIt was useless to ask. What did I know about him or his thoughts? I\r\nlocked myself into my room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE LANDLADY\'S DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nI SAT down, and tried to compose my spirits. Now or never was the time\r\nto decide what it was my duty to my husband and my duty to myself to do\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThe effort was beyond me. Worn out in mind and body alike, I was\r\nperfectly incapable of pursuing any regular train of thought. I vaguely\r\nfelt--if I left things as they were--that I could never hope to remove\r\nthe shadow which now rested on the married life that had begun so\r\nbrightly. We might live together, so as to save appearances. But to\r\nforget what had happened, or to feel satisfied with my position, was\r\nbeyond the power of my will. My tranquillity as a woman--perhaps my\r\ndearest interests as a wife--depended absolutely on penetrating the\r\nmystery of my mother-in-law\'s conduct, and on discovering the true\r\nmeaning of the wild words of penitence and self-reproach which my\r\nhusband had addressed to me on our way home.\r\n\r\nSo far I could advance toward realizing my position--and no further.\r\nWhen I asked myself what was to be done next, hopeless confusion,\r\nmaddening doubt, filled my mind, and transformed me into the most\r\nlistless and helpless of living women.\r\n\r\nI gave up the struggle. In dull, stupid, obstinate despair, I threw\r\nmyself on my bed, and fell from sheer fatigue into a broken, uneasy\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nI was awakened by a knock at the door of my room.\r\n\r\nWas it my husband? I started to my feet as the idea occurred to me. Was\r\nsome new trial of my patience and my fortitude at hand? Half nervously,\r\nhalf irritably, I asked who was there.\r\n\r\nThe landlady\'s voice answered me.\r\n\r\n"Can I speak to you for a moment, if you please?"\r\n\r\nI opened the door. There is no disguising it--though I loved him so\r\ndearly, though I had left home and friends for his sake--it was a relief\r\nto me, at that miserable time, to know that Eustace had not returned to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe landlady came in, and took a seat, without waiting to be invited,\r\nclose by my side. She was no longer satisfied with merely asserting\r\nherself as my equal. Ascending another step on the social ladder, she\r\ntook her stand on the platform of patronage, and charitably looked down\r\non me as an object of pity.\r\n\r\n"I have just returned from Broadstairs," she began. "I hope you will do\r\nme the justice to believe that I sincerely regret what has happened."\r\n\r\nI bowed, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n"As a gentlewoman myself," proceeded the landlady--"reduced by family\r\nmisfortunes to let lodgings, but still a gentlewoman--I feel sincere\r\nsympathy with you. I will even go further than that. I will take it on\r\nmyself to say that I don\'t blame _you_. No, no. I noticed that you were\r\nas much shocked and surprised at your mother-in-law\'s conduct as I was;\r\nand that is saying a great deal--a great deal indeed. However, I have\r\na duty to perform. It is disagreeable, but it is not the less a duty\r\non that account. I am a single woman; not from want of opportunities of\r\nchanging my condition--I beg you will understand that--but from choice.\r\nSituated as I am, I receive only the most respectable persons into my\r\nhouse. There must be no mystery about the positions of _my_ lodgers.\r\nMystery in the position of a lodger carries with it--what shall I say? I\r\ndon\'t wish to offend you--I will say, a certain Taint. Very well. Now I\r\nput it to your own common-sense. Can a person in my position be expected\r\nto expose herself to--Taint? I make these remarks in a sisterly and\r\nChristian spirit. As a lady yourself--I will even go the length of\r\nsaying a cruelly used lady--you will, I am sure, understand--"\r\n\r\nI could endure it no longer. I stopped her there.\r\n\r\n"I understand," I said, "that you wish to give us notice to quit your\r\nlodgings. When do you want us to go?"\r\n\r\nThe landlady held up a long, lean, red hand, in a sorrowful and sisterly\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\n"No," she said. "Not that tone; not those looks. It\'s natural you should\r\nbe annoyed; it\'s natural you should be angry. But do--now do please try\r\nand control yourself. I put it to your own common-sense (we will say a\r\nweek for the notice to quit)--why not treat me like a friend? You don\'t\r\nknow what a sacrifice, what a cruel sacrifice, I have made--entirely for\r\nyour sake.\r\n\r\n"You?" I exclaimed. "What sacrifice?"\r\n\r\n"What sacrifice?" repeated the landlady. "I have degraded myself as a\r\ngentlewoman. I have forfeited my own self-respect." She paused for a\r\nmoment, and suddenly seized my hand in a perfect frenzy of friendship.\r\n"Oh, my poor dear!" cried this intolerable person. "I have discovered\r\neverything. A villain has deceived you. You are no more married than I\r\nam!"\r\n\r\nI snatched my hand out of hers, and rose angrily from my chair.\r\n\r\n"Are you mad?" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe landlady raised her eyes to the ceiling with the air of a person who\r\nhad deserved martyrdom, and who submitted to it cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said. "I begin to think I _am_ mad--mad to have devoted\r\nmyself to an ungrateful woman, to a person who doesn\'t appreciate a\r\nsisterly and Christian sacrifice of self. Well, I won\'t do it again.\r\nHeaven forgive me--I won\'t do it again!"\r\n\r\n"Do what again?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Follow your mother-in-law," cried the landlady, suddenly dropping the\r\ncharacter of a martyr, and assuming the character of a vixen in its\r\nplace. "I blush when I think of it. I followed that most respectable\r\nperson every step of the way to her own door."\r\n\r\nThus far my pride had held me up. It sustained me no longer. I dropped\r\nback again into my chair, in undisguised dread of what was coming next.\r\n\r\n"I gave you a look when I left you on the beach," pursued the landlady,\r\ngrowing louder and louder and redder and redder as she went on. "A\r\ngrateful woman would have understood that look. Never mind! I won\'t\r\ndo it again I overtook your mother-in-law at the gap in the cliff. I\r\nfollowed her--oh, how I feel the disgrace of it _now!_--I followed her\r\nto the station at Broadstairs. She went back by train to Ramsgate. _I_\r\nwent back by train to Ramsgate. She walked to her lodgings. _I_ walked\r\nto her lodgings. Behind her. Like a dog. Oh, the disgrace of it!\r\nProvidentially, as I then thought--I don\'t know what to think of it\r\nnow--the landlord of the house happened to be a friend of mine, and\r\nhappened to be at home. We have no secrets from each other where\r\nlodgers are concerned. I am in a position to tell you, madam, what your\r\nmother-in-law\'s name really is. She knows nothing about any such person\r\nas Mrs. Woodville, for an excellent reason. Her name is _not_ Woodville.\r\nHer name (and consequently her son\'s name) is Macallan--Mrs. Macallan,\r\nwidow of the late General Macallan. Yes! your husband is _not_ your\r\nhusband. You are neither maid, wife, nor widow. You are worse than\r\nnothing, madam, and you leave my house!"\r\n\r\nI stopped her as she opened the door to go out. She had roused _my_\r\ntemper by this time. The doubt that she had cast on my marriage was more\r\nthan mortal resignation could endure.\r\n\r\n"Give me Mrs. Macallan\'s address," I said.\r\n\r\nThe landlady\'s anger receded into the background, and the landlady\'s\r\nastonishment appeared in its place.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to tell me you are going to the old lady herself?" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Nobody but the old lady can tell me what I want to know," I answered.\r\n"Your discovery (as you call it) may be enough for _you_; it is not\r\nenough for _me_. How do we know that Mrs. Macallan may not have been\r\ntwice married? and that her first husband\'s name may not have been\r\nWoodville?"\r\n\r\nThe landlady\'s astonishment subsided in its turn, and the landlady\'s\r\ncuriosity succeeded as the ruling influence of the moment.\r\nSubstantially, as I have already said of her, she was a good-natured\r\nwoman. Her fits of temper (as is usual with good-natured people) were of\r\nthe hot and the short-lived sort, easily roused and easily appeased.\r\n\r\n"I never thought of that," she said. "Look here! if I give you the\r\naddress, will you promise to tell me all about it when you come back?"\r\n\r\nI gave the required promise, and received the address in return.\r\n\r\n"No malice," said the landlady, suddenly resuming all her old\r\nfamiliarity with me.\r\n\r\n"No malice," I answered, with all possible cordiality on my side.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes more I was at my mother-in-law\'s lodgings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. MY OWN DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nFORTUNATELY for me, the landlord did not open the door when I rang. A\r\nstupid maid-of-all-work, who never thought of asking me for my name, let\r\nme in. Mrs. Macallan was at home, and had no visitors with her. Giving\r\nme this information, the maid led the way upstairs, and showed me into\r\nthe drawing-room without a word of announcement.\r\n\r\nMy mother-in-law was sitting alone, near a work-table, knitting. The\r\nmoment I appeared in the doorway she laid aside her work, and, rising,\r\nsigned to me with a commanding gesture of her hand to let her speak\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n"I know what you have come here for," she said. "You have come here to\r\nask questions. Spare yourself, and spare me. I warn you beforehand that\r\nI will not answer any questions relating to my son."\r\n\r\nIt was firmly, but not harshly said. I spoke firmly in my turn.\r\n\r\n"I have not come here, madam, to ask questions about your son," I\r\nanswered. "I have come, if you will excuse me, to ask you a question\r\nabout yourself."\r\n\r\nShe started, and looked at me keenly over her spectacles. I had\r\nevidently taken her by surprise.\r\n\r\n"What is the question?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"I now know for the first time, madam, that your name is Macallan," I\r\nsaid. "Your son has married me under the name of Woodville. The only\r\nhonorable explanation of this circumstance, so far as I know, is that my\r\nhusband is your son by a first marriage. The happiness of my life is at\r\nstake. Will you kindly consider my position? Will you let me ask you if\r\nyou have been twice married, and if the name of your first husband was\r\nWoodville?"\r\n\r\nShe considered a little before she replied.\r\n\r\n"The question is a perfectly natural one in your position," she said.\r\n"But I think I had better not answer it."\r\n\r\n"May I as k why?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. If I answered you, I should only lead to other questions,\r\nand I should be obliged to decline replying to them. I am sorry to\r\ndisappoint you. I repeat what I said on the beach--I have no other\r\nfeeling than a feeling of sympathy toward _you._ If you had consulted me\r\nbefore your marriage, I should willingly have admitted you to my fullest\r\nconfidence. It is now too late. You are married. I recommend you to make\r\nthe best of your position, and to rest satisfied with things as they\r\nare."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, madam," I remonstrated. "As things are, I don\'t know that I\r\n_am_ married. All I know, unless you enlighten me, is that your son has\r\nmarried me under a name that is not his own. How can I be sure whether I\r\nam or am not his lawful wife?"\r\n\r\n"I believe there can be no doubt that you are lawfully my son\'s wife,"\r\nMrs. Macallan answered. "At any rate it is easy to take a legal opinion\r\non the subject. If the opinion is that you are _not_ lawfully married,\r\nmy son (whatever his faults and failings may be) is a gentleman. He is\r\nincapable of willfully deceiving a woman who loves and trusts him. He\r\nwill do you justice. On my side, I will do you justice, too. If the\r\nlegal opinion is adverse to your rightful claims, I will promise to\r\nanswer any questions which you may choose to put to me. As it is, I\r\nbelieve you to be lawfully my son\'s wife; and I say again, make the best\r\nof your position. Be satisfied with your husband\'s affectionate devotion\r\nto you. If you value your peace of mind and the happiness of your life\r\nto come, abstain from attempting to know more than you know now."\r\n\r\nShe sat down again with the air of a woman who had said her last word.\r\n\r\nFurther remonstrance would be useless; I could see it in her face; I\r\ncould hear it in her voice. I turned round to open the drawing-room\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"You are hard on me, madam," I said at parting. "I am at your mercy, and\r\nI must submit."\r\n\r\nShe suddenly looked up, and answered me with a flush on her kind and\r\nhandsome old face.\r\n\r\n"As God is my witness, child, I pity you from the bottom of my heart!"\r\n\r\nAfter that extraordinary outburst of feeling, she took up her work with\r\none hand, and signed to me with the other to leave her.\r\n\r\nI bowed to her in silence, and went out.\r\n\r\nI had entered the house far from feeling sure of the course I ought\r\nto take in the future. I left the house positively resolved, come what\r\nmight of it, to discover the secret which the mother and son were hiding\r\nfrom me. As to the question of the name, I saw it now in the light in\r\nwhich I ought to have seen it from the first. If Mrs. Macallan _had_\r\nbeen twice married (as I had rashly chosen to suppose), she would\r\ncertainly have shown some signs of recognition when she heard me\r\naddressed by her first husband\'s name. Where all else was mystery,\r\nthere was no mystery here. Whatever his reasons might be, Eustace had\r\nassuredly married me under an assumed name.\r\n\r\nApproaching the door of our lodgings, I saw my husband walking backward\r\nand forward before it, evidently waiting for my return. If he asked me\r\nthe question, I decided to tell him frankly where I had been, and what\r\nhad passed between his mother and myself.\r\n\r\nHe hurried to meet me with signs of disturbance in his face and manner.\r\n\r\n"I have a favor to ask of you, Valeria," he said. "Do you mind returning\r\nwith me to London by the next train?"\r\n\r\nI looked at him. In the popular phrase, I could hardly believe my own\r\nears.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a matter of business," he went on, "of no interest to any one but\r\nmyself, and it requires my presence in London. You don\'t wish to sail\r\njust yet, as I understand? I can\'t leave you here by yourself. Have you\r\nany objection to going to London for a day or two?"\r\n\r\nI made no objection. I too was eager to go back.\r\n\r\nIn London I could obtain the legal opinion which would tell me whether\r\nI were lawfully married to Eustace or not. In London I should be within\r\nreach of the help and advice of my father\'s faithful old clerk. I could\r\nconfide in Benjamin as I could confide in no one else. Dearly as I\r\nloved my uncle Starkweather, I shrank from communicating with him in my\r\npresent need. His wife had told me that I made a bad beginning when I\r\nsigned the wrong name in the marriage register. Shall I own it? My pride\r\nshrank from acknowledging, before the honeymoon was over, that his wife\r\nwas right.\r\n\r\nIn two hours more we were on the railway again. Ah, what a contrast that\r\nsecond journey presented to the first! On our way to Ramsgate everybody\r\ncould see that we were a newly wedded couple. On our way to London\r\nnobody noticed us; nobody would have doubted that we had been married\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nWe went to a private hotel in the neighborhood of Portland Place.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the next morning Eustace announced that he must leave me\r\nto attend to his business. I had previously mentioned to him that I had\r\nsome purchases to make in London. He was quite willing to let me go out\r\nalone, on the condition that I should take a carriage provided by the\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\nMy heart was heavy that morning: I felt the unacknowledged estrangement\r\nthat had grown up between us very keenly. My husband opened the door\r\nto go out, and came back to kiss me before he left me by myself. That\r\nlittle after-thought of tenderness touched me. Acting on the impulse of\r\nthe moment, I put my arm round his neck, and held him to me gently.\r\n\r\n"My darling," I said, "give me all your confidence. I know that you love\r\nme. Show that you can trust me too."\r\n\r\nHe sighed bitterly, and drew back from me--in sorrow, not in anger.\r\n\r\n"I thought we had agreed, Valeria, not to return to that subject again,"\r\nhe said. "You only distress yourself and distress me."\r\n\r\nHe left the room abruptly, as if he dare not trust himself to say more.\r\nIt is better not to dwell on what I felt after this last repulse. I\r\nordered the carriage at once. I was eager to find a refuge from my own\r\nthoughts in movement and change.\r\n\r\nI drove to the shops first, and made the purchases which I had mentioned\r\nto Eustace by way of giving a reason for going out. Then I devoted\r\nmyself to the object which I really had at heart. I went to old\r\nBenjamin\'s little villa, in the by-ways of St. John\'s Wood.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had got over the first surprise of seeing me, he noticed\r\nthat I looked pale and care-worn. I confessed at once that I was in\r\ntrouble. We sat down together by the bright fireside in his little\r\nlibrary (Benjamin, as far as his means would allow, was a great\r\ncollector of books), and there I told my old friend, frankly and truly,\r\nall that I have told here.\r\n\r\nHe was too distressed to say much. He fervently pressed my hand; he\r\nfervently thanked God that my father had not lived to hear what he\r\nhad heard. Then, after a pause, he repeated my mother-in-law\'s name to\r\nhimself in a doubting, questioning tone. "Macallan?" he said. "Macallan?\r\nWhere have I heard that name? Why does it sound as if it wasn\'t strange\r\nto me?"\r\n\r\nHe gave up pursuing the lost recollection, and asked, very earnestly,\r\nwhat he could do for me. I answered that he could help me, in the first\r\nplace, to put an end to the doubt--an unendurable doubt to _me_--whether\r\nI were lawfully married or not. His energy of the old days when he had\r\nconducted my father\'s business showed itself again the moment I said\r\nthose words.\r\n\r\n"Your carriage is at the door, my dear," he answered. "Come with me to\r\nmy own lawyer, without wasting another moment."\r\n\r\nWe drove to Lincoln\'s Inn Fields.\r\n\r\nAt my request Benjamin put my case to the lawyer as the case of a friend\r\nin whom I was interested. The answer was given without hesitation. I had\r\nmarried, honestly believing my husband\'s name to be the name under which\r\nI had known him. The witnesses to my marriage--my uncle, my aunt, and\r\nBenjamin--had acted, as I had acted, in perfect good faith. Under those\r\ncircumstances, there was no doubt about the law. I was legally married.\r\nMacallan or Woodville, I was his wife.\r\n\r\nThis decisive answer relieved me of a heavy anxiety. I accepted my old\r\nfriend\'s invitation to return with him to St. John\'s Wood, and to make\r\nmy luncheon at his early dinner.\r\n\r\nOn our way back I reverted to the one other subject which was now\r\nuppermost in my mind. I reiterated my resolution to discover why Eustace\r\nhad not married me under the name that was really his own.\r\n\r\nMy companion shook his head, and entreated me to consider well\r\nbeforehand what I proposed doing. His advice to me--so strangely do\r\nextremes meet!--was my mother-in-law\'s advice, repeated almost word for\r\nword. "Leave things as they are, my dear. In the interest of your own\r\npeace of mind be satisfied with your husband\'s affection. You know\r\nthat you are his wife, and you know that he loves you. Surely that is\r\nenough?"\r\n\r\nI had but one answer to this. Life, on such conditions as my good friend\r\nhad just stated, would be simply unendurable to me. Nothing could alter\r\nmy resolution--for this plain reason, that nothing could reconcile me to\r\nliving with my husband on the terms on which we were living now. It only\r\nrested with Benjamin to say whether he would give a helping hand to his\r\nmaster\'s daughter or not.\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s answer was thoroughly characteristic of him.\r\n\r\n"Mention what you want of me, my dear," was all he said.\r\n\r\nWe were then passing a street in the neighborhood of Portman Square. I\r\nwas on the point of speaking again, when the words were suspended on my\r\nlips. I saw my husband.\r\n\r\nHe was just descending the steps of a house--as if leaving it after a\r\nvisit. His eyes were on the ground: he did not look up when the-carriage\r\npassed. As the servant closed the door behind him, I noticed that the\r\nnumber of the house was Sixteen. At the next corner I saw the name of\r\nthe street. It was Vivian Place.\r\n\r\n"Do you happen to know who lives at Number Sixteen Vivian Place?" I\r\ninquired of my companion.\r\n\r\nBenjamin started. My question was certainly a strange one, after what he\r\nhad just said to me.\r\n\r\n"No," he replied. "Why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"I have just seen Eustace leaving that house."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, and what of that?"\r\n\r\n"My mind is in a bad way, Benjamin. Everything my husband does that I\r\ndon\'t understand rouses my suspicion now."\r\n\r\nBenjamin lifted his withered old hands, and let them drop on his knees\r\nagain in mute lamentation over me.\r\n\r\n"I tell you again," I went on, "my life is unendurable to me. I won\'t\r\nanswer for what I may do if I am left much longer to live in doubt of\r\nthe one man on earth whom I love. You have had experience of the world.\r\nSuppose you were shut out from Eustace\'s confidence, as I am? Suppose\r\nyou were as fond of him as I am, and felt your position as bitterly as I\r\nfeel it--what would you do?"\r\n\r\nThe question was plain. Benjamin met it with a plain answer.\r\n\r\n"I think I should find my way, my dear, to some intimate friend of your\r\nhusband\'s," he said, "and make a few discreet inquiries in that quarter\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\nSome intimate friend of my husband\'s? I considered with myself. There\r\nwas but one friend of his whom I knew of--my uncle\'s correspondent,\r\nMajor Fitz-David. My heart beat fast as the name recurred to my memory.\r\nSuppose I followed Benjamin\'s advice? Suppose I applied to Major\r\nFitz-David? Even if he, too, refused to answer my questions, my position\r\nwould not be more helpless than it was now. I determined to make the\r\nattempt. The only difficulty in the way, so far, was to discover the\r\nMajor\'s address. I had given back his letter to Doctor Starkweather,\r\nat my uncle\'s own request. I remembered that the address from which the\r\nMajor wrote was somewhere in London--and I remembered no more.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, old friend; you have given me an idea already," I said to\r\nBenjamin. "Have you got a Directory in your house?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear," he rejoined, looking very much puzzled. "But I can easily\r\nsend out and borrow one."\r\n\r\nWe returned to the villa. The servant was sent at once to the nearest\r\nstationer\'s to borrow a Directory. She returned with the book just as we\r\nsat down to dinner. Searching for the Major\'s name under the letter F, I\r\nwas startled by a new discovery.\r\n\r\n"Benjamin!" I said. "This is a strange coincidence. Look here!"\r\n\r\nHe looked where I pointed. Major Fitz-David\'s address was Number Sixteen\r\nVivian Place--the very house which I had seen my husband leaving as we\r\npassed in the carriage!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. ON THE WAY TO THE MAJOR.\r\n\r\n"YES," said Benjamin. "It _is_ a coincidence certainly. Still--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked at me. He seemed a little doubtful how I might\r\nreceive what he had it in his mind to say to me next.\r\n\r\n"Go on," I said.\r\n\r\n"Still, my dear, I see nothing suspicious in what has happened," he\r\nresumed. "To my mind it is quite natural that your husband, being in\r\nLondon, should pay a visit to one of his friends. And it\'s equally\r\nnatural that we should pass through Vivian Place on our way back here.\r\nThis seems to be the reasonable view. What do _you_ say?"\r\n\r\n"I have told you already that my mind is in a bad way about Eustace,"\r\nI answered. "_I_ say there is some motive at the bottom of his visit to\r\nMajor Fitz-David. It is not an ordinary call. I am firmly convinced it\r\nis not an ordinary call!"\r\n\r\n"Suppose we get on with our dinner?" said Benjamin, resignedly. "Here is\r\na loin of mutton, my dear--an ordinary loin of mutton. Is there anything\r\nsuspicious in _that?_ Very well, then. Show me you have confidence in\r\nthe mutton; please eat. There\'s the wine, again. No mystery, Valeria,\r\nin that claret--I\'ll take my oath it\'s nothing but innocent juice of the\r\ngrape. If we can\'t believe in anything else, let\'s believe in juice of\r\nthe grape. Your good health, my dear."\r\n\r\nI adapted myself to the old man\'s genial humor as readily as I could.\r\nWe ate and we drank, and we talked of by-gone days. For a little while I\r\nwas almost happy in the company of my fatherly old friend. Why was I not\r\nold too? Why had I not done with love, with its certain miseries, its\r\ntransient delights, its cruel losses, its bitterly doubtful gains? The\r\nlast autumn flowers in the window basked brightly in the last of the\r\nautumn sunlight. Benjamin\'s little dog digested his dinner in perfect\r\ncomfort on the hearth. The parrot in the next house screeched his vocal\r\naccomplishments cheerfully. I don\'t doubt that it is a great privilege\r\nto be a human being. But may it not be the happier destiny to be an\r\nanimal or a plant?\r\n\r\nThe brief respite was soon over; all my anxieties came back. I was once\r\nmore a doubting, discontented, depressed creature when I rose to say\r\ngood-by.\r\n\r\n"Promise, my dear, you will do nothing rash," said Benjamin, as he\r\nopened the door for me.\r\n\r\n"Is it rash to go to Major Fitz-David?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes--if you go by yourself. You don\'t know what sort of man he is; you\r\ndon\'t know how he may receive you. Let me try first, and pave the way,\r\nas the saying is. Trust my experience, my dear. In matters of this sort\r\nthere is nothing like paving the way."\r\n\r\nI considered a moment. It was due to my good friend to consider before I\r\nsaid No.\r\n\r\nReflection decided me on taking the responsibility, whatever it might\r\nbe, upon my own shoulders. Good or bad, compassionate or cruel, the\r\nMajor was a man. A woman\'s influence was the safest influence to trust\r\nwith him, where the end to be gained was such an end as I had in view.\r\nIt was not easy to say this to Benjamin without the danger of mortifying\r\nhim. I made an appointment with the old man to call on me the next\r\nmorning at the hotel, and talk the matter over again. Is it very\r\ndisgraceful to me to add that I privately determined (if the thing could\r\nbe accomplished) to see Major Fitz-David in the interval?\r\n\r\n"Do nothing rash, my dear. In your own interests, do nothing rash!"\r\n\r\nThose were Benjamin\'s last words when we parted for the day.\r\n\r\nI found Eustace waiting for me in our sitting-room at the hotel. His\r\nspirits seemed to have revived since I had seen him last. He advanced to\r\nmeet me cheerfully, with an open sheet of paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n"My business is settled, Valeria, sooner than I had expected," he began,\r\ngayly. "Are your purchases all completed, fair lady? Are _you_ free\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\nI had learned already (God help me!) to distrust his fits of gayety. I\r\nasked, cautiously,\r\n\r\n"Do you mean free for to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Free for to-day, and to-morrow, and next week, and next month--and next\r\nyear too, for all I know to the contrary," he answered, putting his arm\r\nboisterously round my waist. "Look here!"\r\n\r\nHe lifted the open sheet of paper which I had noticed in his hand, and\r\nheld it for me to read. It was a telegram to the sailing-master of the\r\nyacht, informing him that we had arranged to return to Ramsgate that\r\nevening, and that we should be ready to sail for the Mediterranean with\r\nthe next tide.\r\n\r\n"I only waited for your return," said Eustace, "to send the telegram to\r\nthe office."\r\n\r\nHe crossed the room as he spoke to ring the bell. I stopped him.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I can\'t go to Ramsgate to-day," I said.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" he asked, suddenly changing his tone, and speaking sharply.\r\n\r\nI dare say it will seem ridiculous to some people, but it is really true\r\nthat he shook my resolution to go to Major Fitz-David when he put his\r\narm round me. Even a mere passing caress from _him_ stole away my heart,\r\nand softly tempted me to yield. But the ominous alteration in his tone\r\nmade another woman of me. I felt once more, and felt more strongly than\r\never, that in my critical position it was useless to stand still, and\r\nworse than useless to draw back.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to disappoint you," I answered. "It is impossible for me (as\r\nI told you at Ramsgate) to be ready to sail at a moment\'s notice. I want\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\nNot only his tone, but his look, when he put that second question,\r\njarred on every nerve in me. He roused in my mind--I can\'t tell how or\r\nwhy--an angry sense of the indignity that he had put upon his wife in\r\nmarrying her under a false name. Fearing that I should answer rashly,\r\nthat I should say something which my better sense might regret, if I\r\nspoke at that moment, I said nothing. Women alone can estimate what it\r\ncost me to be silent. And men alone can understand how irritating my\r\nsilence must have been to my husband.\r\n\r\n"You want time?" he repeated. "I ask you again--what for?"\r\n\r\nMy self-control, pushed to its extremest limits, failed me. The rash\r\nreply flew out of my lips, like a bird set free from a cage.\r\n\r\n"I want time," I said, "to accustom myself to my right name."\r\n\r\nHe suddenly stepped up to me with a dark look.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by your \'right name?\'"\r\n\r\n"Surely you know," I answered. "I once thought I was Mrs. Woodville. I\r\nhave now discovered that I am Mrs. Macallan."\r\n\r\nHe started back at the sound of his own name as if I had struck him--he\r\nstarted back, and turned so deadly pale that I feared he was going to\r\ndrop at my feet in a swoon. Oh, my tongue! my tongue! Why had I not\r\ncontrolled my miserable, mischievous woman\'s tongue!\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to alarm you, Eustace," I said. "I spoke at random. Pray\r\nforgive me."\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand impatiently, as if my penitent words were tangible\r\nthings--ruffling, worrying things, like flies in summer--which he was\r\nputting away from him.\r\n\r\n"What else have you discovered?" he asked, in low, stern tones.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Eustace."\r\n\r\n"Nothing?" He paused as he repeated the word, and passed his hand over\r\nhis forehead in a weary way. "Nothing, of course," he resumed, speaking\r\nto himself, "or she would not be here." He paused once more, and looked\r\nat me searchingly. "Don\'t say again what you said just now," he went on.\r\n"For your own sake, Valeria, as well as for mine." He dropped into the\r\nnearest chair, and said no more.\r\n\r\nI certainly heard the warning; but the only words which really produced\r\nan impression on my mind were the words preceding it, which he had\r\nspoken to himself. He had said: "Nothing, of course, _or she could not\r\nbe here."_ If I had found out some other truth besides the truth about\r\nthe name, would it have prevented me from ever returning to my husband?\r\nWas that what he meant? Did the sort of discovery that he contemplated\r\nmean something so dreadful that it would have parted us at once and\r\nforever? I stood by his chair in silence, and tried to find the answer\r\nto those terrible questions in his face. It used to speak to me so\r\neloquently when it spoke of his love. It told me nothing now.\r\n\r\nHe sat for some time without looking at me, lost in his own thoughts.\r\nThen he rose on a sudden and took his hat.\r\n\r\n"The friend who lent me the yacht is in town," he said. "I suppose I had\r\nbetter see him, and say our plans are changed." He tore up the telegram\r\nwith an air of sullen resignation as he spoke. "You are evidently\r\ndetermined not to go to sea with me," he resumed. "We had better give it\r\nup. I don\'t see what else is to be done. Do you?"\r\n\r\nHis tone was almost a tone of contempt. I was too depressed about\r\nmyself, too alarmed about _him,_ to resent it.\r\n\r\n"Decide as you think best, Eustace," I said, sadly. "Every way, the\r\nprospect seems a hopeless one. As long as I am shut out from your\r\nconfidence, it matters little whether we live on land or at sea--we\r\ncannot live happily."\r\n\r\n"If you could control your curiosity." he answered, sternly, "we might\r\nlive happily enough. I thought I had married a woman who was superior to\r\nthe vulgar failings of her sex. A good wife should know better than to\r\npry into affairs of her husband\'s with which she had no concern."\r\n\r\nSurely it was hard to bear this? However, I bore it.\r\n\r\n"Is it no concern of mine?" I asked, gently, "when I find that my\r\nhusband has not married me under his family name? Is it no concern of\r\nmine when I hear your mother say, in so many words, that she pities your\r\nwife? It is hard, Eustace, to accuse me of curiosity because I cannot\r\naccept the unendurable position in which you have placed me. Your cruel\r\nsilence is a blight on my happiness and a threat to my future. Your\r\ncruel silence is estranging us from each other at the beginning of our\r\nmarried life. And you blame me for feeling this? You tell me I am prying\r\ninto affairs which are yours only? They are _not_ yours only: I have my\r\ninterest in them too. Oh, my darling, why do you trifle with our love\r\nand our confidence in each other? Why do you keep me in the dark?"\r\n\r\nHe answered with a stern and pitiless brevity,\r\n\r\n"For your own good."\r\n\r\nI turned away from him in silence. He was treating me like a child.\r\n\r\nHe followed me. Putting one hand heavily on my shoulder, he forced me to\r\nface him once more.\r\n\r\n"Listen to this," he said. "What I am now going to say to you I say for\r\nthe first and last time. Valeria! if you ever discover what I am\r\nnow keeping from your knowledge--from that moment you live a life of\r\ntorture; your tranquillity is gone. Your days will be days of terror;\r\nyour nights will be full of horrid dreams--through no fault of mine,\r\nmind! through no fault of mine! Every day of your life you will feel\r\nsome new distrust, some growing fear of me, and you will be doing me the\r\nvilest injustice all the time. On my faith as a Christian, on my honor\r\nas a man, if you stir a step further in this matter, there is an end to\r\nyour happiness for the rest of your life! Think seriously of what I have\r\nsaid to you; you will have time to reflect. I am going to tell my friend\r\nthat our plans for the Mediterranean are given up. I shall not be\r\nback before the evening." He sighed, and looked at me with unutterable\r\nsadness. "I love you, Valeria," he said. "In spite of all that has\r\npassed, as God is my witness, I love you more dearly than ever."\r\n\r\nSo he spoke. So he left me.\r\n\r\nI must write the truth about myself, however strange it may appear. I\r\ndon\'t pretend to be able to analyze my own motives; I don\'t pretend even\r\nto guess how other women might have acted in my place. It is true of me,\r\nthat my husband\'s terrible warning--all the more terrible in its mystery\r\nand its vagueness--produced no deterrent effect on my mind: it only\r\nstimulated my resolution to discover what he was hiding from me. He\r\nhad not been gone two minutes before I rang the bell and ordered the\r\ncarriage, to take me to Major Fitz-David\'s house in Vivian Place.\r\n\r\nWalking to and fro while I was waiting--I was in such a fever of\r\nexcitement that it was impossible for me to sit still--I accidentally\r\ncaught sight of myself in the glass.\r\n\r\nMy own face startled me, it looked so haggard and so wild. Could I\r\npresent myself to a stranger, could I hope to produce the necessary\r\nimpression in my favor, looking as I looked at that moment? For all I\r\nknew to the contrary, my whole future might depend upon the effect which\r\nI produced on Major Fitz-David at first sight. I rang the bell again,\r\nand sent a message to one of the chambermaids to follow me to my room.\r\n\r\nI had no maid of my own with me: the stewardess of the yacht would\r\nhave acted as my attendant if we had held to our first arrangement. It\r\nmattered little, so long as I had a woman to help me. The chambermaid\r\nappeared. I can give no better idea of the disordered and desperate\r\ncondition of my mind at that time than by owning that I actually\r\nconsulted this perfect stranger on the question of my personal\r\nappearance. She was a middle-aged woman, with a large experience of the\r\nworld and its wickedness written legibly on her manner and on her face.\r\nI put money into the woman\'s hand, enough of it to surprise her.\r\nShe thanked me with a cynical smile, evidently placing her own evil\r\ninterpretation on my motive for bribing her.\r\n\r\n"What can I do for you, ma\'am?" she asked, in a confidential whisper.\r\n"Don\'t speak loud! there is somebody in the next room."\r\n\r\n"I want to look my best," I said, "and I have sent for you to help me."\r\n\r\n"I understand, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"What do you understand?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head significantly, and whispered to me again. "Lord\r\nbless you, I\'m used to this!" she said. "There is a gentleman in the\r\ncase. Don\'t mind me, ma\'am. It\'s a way I have. I mean no harm." She\r\nstopped, and looked at me critically. "I wouldn\'t change my dress if I\r\nwere you," she went on. "The color becomes you."\r\n\r\nIt was too late to resent the woman\'s impertinence. There was no help\r\nfor it but to make use of her. Besides, she was right about the dress.\r\nIt was of a delicate maize-color, prettily trimmed with lace. I could\r\nwear nothing which suited me better. My hair, however, stood in need of\r\nsome skilled attention. The chambermaid rearranged it with a ready hand\r\nwhich showed that she was no beginner in the art of dressing hair. She\r\nlaid down the combs and brushes, and looked at me; then looked at the\r\ntoilet-table, searching for something which she apparently failed to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\n"Where do you keep it?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Look at your complexion, ma\'am. You will frighten him if he sees you\r\nlike that. A touch of color you _must_ have. Where do you keep it? What!\r\nyou haven\'t got it? you never use it? Dear, dear, dear me!"\r\n\r\nFor a moment surprise fairly deprived her of her self-possession.\r\nRecovering herself, she begged permission to leave me for a minute. I\r\nlet her go, knowing what her errand was. She came back with a box of\r\npaint and powders; and I said nothing to check her. I saw, in the glass,\r\nmy skin take a false fairness, my cheeks a false color, my eyes a false\r\nbrightness--and I never shrank from it. No! I let the odious conceit go\r\non; I even admired the extraordinary delicacy and dexterity with which\r\nit was all done. "Anything" (I thought to myself, in the madness of that\r\nmiserable time) "so long as it helps me to win the Major\'s confidence!\r\nAnything, so long as I discover what those last words of my husband\'s\r\nreally mean!"\r\n\r\nThe transformation of my face was accomplished. The chambermaid pointed\r\nwith her wicked forefinger in the direction of the glass.\r\n\r\n"Bear in mind, ma\'am, what you looked like when you sent for me," she\r\nsaid. "And just see for yourself how you look now. You\'re the prettiest\r\nwoman (of your style) in London. Ah what a thing pearl-powder is, when\r\none knows how to use it!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE FRIEND OF THE WOMEN.\r\n\r\nI FIND it impossible to describe my sensations while the carriage was\r\ntaking me to Major Fitz-David\'s house. I doubt, indeed, if I really felt\r\nor thought at all, in the true sense of those words.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when I had resigned myself into the hands of the\r\nchambermaid I seemed in some strange way to have lost my ordinary\r\nidentity--to have stepped out of my own character. At other times my\r\ntemperament was of the nervous and anxious sort, and my tendency was to\r\nexaggerate any difficulties that might place themselves in my way. At\r\nother times, having before me the prospect of a critical interview with\r\na stranger, I should have considered with myself what it might be wise\r\nto pass over, and what it might be wise to say. Now I never gave\r\nmy coming interview with the Major a thought; I felt an unreasoning\r\nconfidence in myself, and a blind faith in _him_. Now neither the past\r\nnor the future troubled me; I lived unreflectingly in the present. I\r\nlooked at the shops as we drove by them, and at the other carriages as\r\nthey passed mine. I noticed--yes, and enjoyed--the glances of admiration\r\nwhich chance foot-passengers on the pavement cast on me. I said to\r\nmyself, "This looks well for my prospect of making a friend of\r\nthe Major!" When we drew up at the door in Vivian Place, it is no\r\nexaggeration to say that I had but one anxiety--anxiety to find the\r\nMajor at home.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by a servant out of livery, an old man who looked as\r\nif he might have been a soldier in his earlier days. He eyed me with\r\na grave attention, which relaxed little by little into sly approval. I\r\nasked for Major Fitz-David. The answer was not altogether encouraging:\r\nthe man was not sure whether his master were at home or not.\r\n\r\nI gave him my card. My cards, being part of my wedding outfit,\r\nnecessarily had the false name printed on them--_Mrs. Eustace\r\nWoodville_. The servant showed me into a front room on the ground-floor,\r\nand disappeared with my card in his hand.\r\n\r\nLooking about me, I noticed a door in the wall opposite the window,\r\ncommunicating with some inner room. The door was not of the ordinary\r\nkind. It fitted into the thickness of the partition wall, and worked in\r\ngrooves. Looking a little nearer, I saw that it had not been pulled out\r\nso as completely to close the doorway. Only the merest chink was left;\r\nbut it was enough to convey to my ears all that passed in the next room.\r\n\r\n"What did you say, Oliver, when she asked for me?" inquired a man\'s\r\nvoice, pitched cautiously in a low key.\r\n\r\n"I said I was not sure you were at home, sir," answered the voice of the\r\nservant who had let me in.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The first speaker was evidently Major Fitz-David\r\nhimself. I waited to hear more.\r\n\r\n"I think I had better not see her, Oliver," the Major\'s voice resumed.\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir."\r\n\r\n"Say I have gone out, and you don\'t know when I shall be back again. Beg\r\nthe lady to write, if she has any business with me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Stop, Oliver!"\r\n\r\nOliver stopped. There was another and longer pause. Then the master\r\nresumed the examination of the man.\r\n\r\n"Is she young, Oliver?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And--pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Better than pretty, sir, to my thinking."\r\n\r\n"Aye? aye? What you call a fine woman--eh, Oliver?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir."\r\n\r\n"Tall?"\r\n\r\n"Nearly as tall as I am, Major."\r\n\r\n"Aye? aye? aye? A good figure?"\r\n\r\n"As slim as a sapling, sir, and as upright as a dart."\r\n\r\n"On second thoughts, I am at home, Oliver. Show her in! show her in!"\r\n\r\nSo far, one thing at least seemed to be clear. I had done well in\r\nsending for the chambermaid. What would Oliver\'s report of me have\r\nbeen if I had presented myself to him with my colorless cheeks and my\r\nill-dressed hair?\r\n\r\nThe servant reappeared, and conducted me to the inner room. Major\r\nFitz-David advanced to welcome me. What was the Major like?\r\n\r\nWell, he was like a well-preserved old gentleman of, say, sixty years\r\nold, little and lean, and chiefly remarkable by the extraordinary length\r\nof his nose. After this feature, I noticed next his beautiful brown wig;\r\nhis sparkling little gray eyes; his rosy complexion; his short military\r\nwhisker, dyed to match his wig; his white teeth and his winning smile;\r\nhis smart blue frock-coat, with a camellia in the button-hole; and his\r\nsplendid ring, a ruby, flashing on his little finger as he courteously\r\nsigned to me to take a chair.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs. Woodville, how very kind of you this is! I have been longing\r\nto have the happiness of knowing you. Eustace is an old friend of\r\nmine. I congratulated him when I heard of his marriage. May I make a\r\nconfession?--I envy him now I have seen his wife."\r\n\r\nThe future of my life was perhaps in this man\'s hands. I studied him\r\nattentively: I tried to read his character in his face.\r\n\r\nThe Major\'s sparkling little gray eyes softened as they looked at me;\r\nthe Major\'s strong and sturdy voice dropped to its lowest and tenderest\r\ntones when he spoke to me; the Major\'s manner expressed, from the moment\r\nwhen I entered the room, a happy mixture of admiration and respect. He\r\ndrew his chair close to mine, as if it were a privilege to be near me.\r\nHe took my hand and lifted my glove to his lips, as if that glove\r\nwere the most delicious luxury the world could produce. "Dear Mrs.\r\nWoodville," he said, as he softly laid my hand back on my lap, "bear\r\nwith an old fellow who worships your enchanting sex. You really brighten\r\nthis dull house. It is _such_ a pleasure to see you!"\r\n\r\nThere was no need for the old gentleman to make his little confession.\r\nWomen, children, and dogs proverbially know by instinct who the people\r\nare who really like them. The women had a warm friend--perhaps at one\r\ntime a dangerously warm friend--in Major Fitz-David. I knew as much of\r\nhim as that before I had settled myself in my chair and opened my lips\r\nto answer him.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Major, for your kind reception and your pretty compliment,"\r\nI said, matching my host\'s easy tone as closely as the necessary\r\nrestraints on my side would permit. "You have made your confession. May\r\nI make mine?"\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David lifted my hand again from my lap and drew his chair as\r\nclose as possible to mine. I looked at him gravely and tried to release\r\nmy hand. Major Fitz-David declined to let go of it, and proceeded to\r\ntell me why.\r\n\r\n"I have just heard you speak for the first time," he said. "I am under\r\nthe charm of your voice. Dear Mrs. Woodville, bear with an old fellow\r\nwho is under the charm! Don\'t grudge me my innocent little pleasures.\r\nLend me--I wish I could say _give_ me--this pretty hand. I am such an\r\nadmirer of pretty hands! I can listen so much better with a pretty hand\r\nin mine. The ladies indulge my weakness. Please indulge me too. Yes? And\r\nwhat were you going to say?"\r\n\r\n"I was going to say, Major, that I felt particularly sensible of your\r\nkind welcome because, as it happens, I have a favor to ask of you."\r\n\r\nI was conscious, while I spoke, that I was approaching the object of my\r\nvisit a little too abruptly. But Major Fitz-David\'s admiration rose\r\nfrom one climax to another with such alarming rapidity that I felt the\r\nimportance of administering a practical check to it. I trusted to those\r\nominous words, "a favor to ask of you," to administer the check, and I\r\ndid not trust in vain. My aged admirer gently dropped my hand, and, with\r\nall possible politeness, changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"The favor is granted, of course!" he said. "And now, tell me, how is\r\nour dear Eustace?"\r\n\r\n"Anxious and out of spirits." I answered.\r\n\r\n"Anxious and out of spirits!" repeated the Major. "The enviable man who\r\nis married to You anxious and out of spirits? Monstrous! Eustace fairly\r\ndisgusts me. I shall take him off the list of my friends."\r\n\r\n"In that case, take me off the list with him, Major. I am in wretched\r\nspirits too. You are my husband\'s old friend. I may acknowledge to _you_\r\nthat our married life is just now not quite a happy one."\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David lifted his eyebrows (dyed to match his whiskers) in\r\npolite surprise.\r\n\r\n"Already!" he exclaimed. "What can Eustace be made of? Has he no\r\nappreciation of beauty and grace? Is he the most insensible of living\r\nbeings?"\r\n\r\n"He is the best and dearest of men," I answered. "But there is some\r\ndreadful mystery in his past life--"\r\n\r\nI could get no further; Major Fitz-David deliberately stopped me. He did\r\nit with the smoothest politeness, on the surface. But I saw a look in\r\nhis bright little eyes which said, plainly, "If you _will_ venture on\r\ndelicate ground, madam, don\'t ask me to accompany you."\r\n\r\n"My charming friend!" he exclaimed. "May I call you my charming friend?\r\nYou have--among a thousand other delightful qualities which I can see\r\nalready--a vivid imagination. Don\'t let it get the upper hand. Take an\r\nold fellow\'s advice; don\'t let it get the upper hand! What can I offer\r\nyou, dear Mrs. Woodville? A cup of tea?"\r\n\r\n"Call me by my right name, sir," I answered, boldly. "I have made a\r\ndiscovery. I know as well as you do that my name is Macallan."\r\n\r\nThe Major started, and looked at me very attentively. His manner became\r\ngrave, his tone changed completely, when he spoke next.\r\n\r\n"May I ask," he said, "if you have communicated to your husband the\r\ndiscovery which you have just mentioned to me?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly!" I answered. "I consider that my husband owes me an\r\nexplanation. I have asked him to tell me what his extraordinary conduct\r\nmeans--and he has refused, in language that frightens me. I have\r\nappealed to his mother--and _she_ has refused to explain, in language\r\nthat humiliates me. Dear Major Fitz-David, I have no friends to take\r\nmy part: I have nobody to come to but you! Do me the greatest of all\r\nfavors--tell me why your friend Eustace has married me under a false\r\nname!"\r\n\r\n"Do _me_ the greatest of all favors;" answered the Major. "Don\'t ask me\r\nto say a word about it."\r\n\r\nHe looked, in spite of his unsatisfactory reply, as if he really felt\r\nfor me. I determined to try my utmost powers of persuasion; I resolved\r\nnot to be beaten at the first repulse.\r\n\r\n"I _must_ ask you," I said. "Think of my position. How can I live,\r\nknowing what I know--and knowing no more? I would rather hear the\r\nmost horrible thing you can tell me than be condemned (as I am now) to\r\nperpetual misgiving and perpetual suspense. I love my husband with all\r\nmy heart; but I cannot live with him on these terms: the misery of it\r\nwould drive me mad. I am only a woman, Major. I can only throw myself on\r\nyour kindness. Don\'t--pray, pray don\'t keep me in the dark!"\r\n\r\nI could say no more. In the reckless impulse of the moment I snatched up\r\nhis hand and raised it to my lips. The gallant old gentleman started as\r\nif I had given him an electric shock.\r\n\r\n"My dear, dear lady!" he exclaimed, "I can\'t tell you how I feel for\r\nyou! You charm me, you overwhelm me, you touch me to the heart. What can\r\nI say? What can I do? I can only imitate your admirable frankness, your\r\nfearless candor. You have told me what your position is. Let me tell\r\nyou, in my turn, how I am placed. Compose yourself--pray compose\r\nyourself! I have a smelling-bottle here at the service of the ladies.\r\nPermit me to offer it."\r\n\r\nHe brought me the smelling-bottle; he put a little stool under my feet;\r\nhe entreated me to take time enough to compose myself. "Infernal fool!"\r\nI heard him say to himself, as he considerately turned away from me for\r\na few moments. "If _I_ had been her husband, come what might of it, I\r\nwould have told her the truth!"\r\n\r\nWas he referring to Eustace? And was he going to do what he would have\r\ndone in my husband\'s place?--was he really going to tell me the truth?\r\n\r\nThe idea had barely crossed my mind when I was startled by a loud and\r\nperemptory knocking at the street door. The Major stopped and listened\r\nattentively. In a few moments the door was opened, and the rustling of a\r\nwoman\'s dress was plainly audible in the hall. The Major hurried to the\r\ndoor of the room with the activity of a young man. He was too late. The\r\ndoor was violently opened from the outer side, just as he got to it. The\r\nlady of the rustling dress burst into the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE DEFEAT OF THE MAJOR.\r\n\r\nMAJOR FITZ-DAVID\'S visitor proved to be a plump, round-eyed overdressed\r\ngirl, with a florid complexion and straw colored hair. After first\r\nfixing on me a broad stare of astonishment, she pointedly addressed her\r\napologies for intruding on us to the Major alone. The creature evidently\r\nbelieved me to be the last new object of the old gentleman\'s idolatry;\r\nand she took no pains to disguise her jealous resentment on discovering\r\nus together. Major Fitz-David set matters right in his own irresistible\r\nway. He kissed the hand of the overdressed girl as devotedly as he had\r\nkissed mine; he told her she was looking charmingly. Then he led her,\r\nwith his happy mixture of admiration and respect, back to the door by\r\nwhich she had entered--a second door communicating directly with the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n"No apology is necessary, my dear," he said. "This lady is with me on\r\na matter of business. You will find your singing-master waiting for you\r\nupstairs. Begin your lesson; and I will join you in a few minutes. _Au\r\nrevoir_, my charming pupil--_au revoir._"\r\n\r\nThe young lady answered this polite little speech in a whisper--with her\r\nround eyes fixed distrustfully on me while she spoke. The door closed on\r\nher. Major Fitz-David was a t liberty to set matters right with me, in\r\nmy turn.\r\n\r\n"I call that young person one of my happy discoveries;" said the old\r\ngentleman, complacently. "She possesses, I don\'t hesitate to say, the\r\nfinest soprano voice in Europe. Would you believe it, I met with her at\r\nthe railway station. She was behind the counter in a refreshment-room,\r\npoor innocent, rinsing wine-glasses, and singing over her work. Good\r\nHeavens, such singing! Her upper notes electrified me. I said to myself;\r\n\'Here is a born prima donna--I will bring her out!\' She is the third\r\nI have brought out in my time. I shall take her to Italy when her\r\neducation is sufficiently advanced, and perfect her at Milan. In that\r\nunsophisticated girl, my dear lady, you see one of the future Queens of\r\nSong. Listen! She is beginning her scales. What a voice! Brava! Brava!\r\nBravissima!"\r\n\r\nThe high soprano notes of the future Queen of Song rang through the\r\nhouse as he spoke. Of the loudness of the young lady\'s voice there could\r\nbe no sort of doubt. The sweetness and the purity of it admitted, in my\r\nopinion, of considerable dispute.\r\n\r\nHaving said the polite words which the occasion rendered necessary, I\r\nventured to recall Major Fitz-David to the subject in discussion between\r\nus when his visitor had entered the room. The Major was very unwilling\r\nto return to the perilous topic on which we had just touched when the\r\ninterruption occurred. He beat time with his forefinger to the singing\r\nupstairs; he asked me about _my_ voice, and whether I sang; he remarked\r\nthat life would be intolerable to him without Love and Art. A man in my\r\nplace would have lost all patience, and would have given up the struggle\r\nin disgust. Being a woman, and having my end in view, my resolution was\r\ninvincible. I fairly wore out the Major\'s resistance, and compelled him\r\nto surrender at discretion. It is only justice to add that, when he did\r\nmake up his mind to speak to me again of Eustace, he spoke frankly, and\r\nspoke to the point.\r\n\r\n"I have known your husband," he began, "since the time when he was a\r\nboy. At a certain period of his past life a terrible misfortune fell\r\nupon him. The secret of that misfortune is known to his friends, and\r\nis religiously kept by his friends. It is the secret that he is keeping\r\nfrom You. He will never tell it to you as long as he lives. And he has\r\nbound _me_ not to tell it, under a promise given on my word of honor.\r\nYou wished, dear Mrs. Woodville, to be made acquainted with my position\r\ntoward Eustace. There it is!"\r\n\r\n"You persist in calling me Mrs. Woodville," I said.\r\n\r\n"Your husband wishes me to persist," the Major answered. "He assumed the\r\nname of Woodville, fearing to give his own name, when he first called\r\nat your uncle\'s house. He will now acknowledge no other. Remonstrance\r\nis useless. You must do what we do--you must give way to an unreasonable\r\nman. The best fellow in the world in other respects: in this one matter\r\nas obstinate and self-willed as he can be. If you ask me my opinion, I\r\ntell you honestly that I think he was wrong in courting and marrying\r\nyou under his false name. He trusted his honor and his happiness to your\r\nkeeping in making you his--wife. Why should he not trust the story of\r\nhis troubles to you as well? His mother quite shares my opinion in\r\nthis matter. You must not blame her for refusing to admit you into\r\nher confidence after your marriage: it was then too late. Before your\r\nmarriage she did all she could do--without betraying secrets which, as\r\na good mother, she was bound to respect--to induce her son to act justly\r\ntoward you. I commit no indiscretion when I tell you that she refused\r\nto sanction your marriage mainly for the reason that Eustace refused to\r\nfollow her advice, and to tell you what his position really was. On my\r\npart I did all I could to support Mrs. Macallan in the course that she\r\ntook. When Eustace wrote to tell me that he had engaged himself to marry\r\na niece of my good friend Doctor Starkweather, and that he had mentioned\r\nme as his reference, I wrote back to warn him that I would have nothing\r\nto do with the affair unless he revealed the whole truth about himself\r\nto his future wife. He refused to listen to me, as he had refused to\r\nlisten to his mother; and he held me at the same time to my promise to\r\nkeep his secret. When Starkweather wrote to me, I had no choice but to\r\ninvolve myself in a deception of which I thoroughly disapproved, or to\r\nanswer in a tone so guarded and so brief as to stop the correspondence\r\nat the outset. I chose the last alternative; and I fear I have offended\r\nmy good old friend. You now see the painful position in which I am\r\nplaced. To add to the difficulties of that situation, Eustace came here\r\nthis very day to warn me to be on my guard, in case of your addressing\r\nto me the very request which you have just made! He told me that you had\r\nmet with his mother, by an unlucky accident, and that you had discovered\r\nthe family name. He declared that he had traveled to London for the\r\nexpress purpose of speaking to me personally on this serious subject.\r\n\'I know your weakness,\' he said, \'where women are concerned. Valeria is\r\naware that you are my old friend. She will certainly write to you; she\r\nmay even be bold enough to make her way into your house. Renew your\r\npromise to keep the great calamity of my life a secret, on your honor\r\nand on your oath. \'Those were his words, as nearly as I can remember\r\nthem. I tried to treat the thing lightly; I ridiculed the absurdly\r\ntheatrical notion of \'renewing my promise,\' and all the rest of it.\r\nQuite useless! He refused to leave me; he reminded me of his unmerited\r\nsufferings, poor fellow, in the past time. It ended in his bursting into\r\ntears. You love him, and so do I. Can you wonder that I let him have his\r\nway? The result is that I am doubly bound to tell you nothing, by the\r\nmost sacred promise that a man can give. My dear lady, I cordially side\r\nwith you in this matter; I long to relieve your anxieties. But what can\r\nI do?"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and waited--gravely waited--to hear my reply.\r\n\r\nI had listened from beginning to end without interrupting him. The\r\nextraordinary change in his manner, and in his way of expressing\r\nhimself, while he was speaking of Eustace, alarmed me as nothing had\r\nalarmed me yet. How terrible (I thought to myself) must this untold\r\nstory be, if the mere act of referring to it makes light-hearted Major\r\nFitz-David speak seriously and sadly, never smiling, never paying me a\r\ncompliment, never even noticing the singing upstairs! My heart sank in\r\nme as I drew that startling conclusion. For the first time since I had\r\nentered the house I was at the end of my resources; I knew neither what\r\nto say nor what to do next.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I kept my seat. Never had the resolution to discover what my\r\nhusband was hiding from me been more firmly rooted in my mind than it\r\nwas at that moment! I cannot account for the extraordinary inconsistency\r\nin my character which this confession implies. I can only describe the\r\nfacts as they really were.\r\n\r\nThe singing went on upstairs. Major Fitz-David still waited impenetrably\r\nto hear what I had to say--to know what I resolved on doing next.\r\n\r\nBefore I had decided what to say or what to do, another domestic\r\nincident happened. In plain words, another knocking announced a new\r\nvisitor at the house door. On this occasion there was no rustling of a\r\nwoman\'s dress in the hall. On this occasion only the old servant\r\nentered the room, carrying a magnificent nosegay in his hand. "With Lady\r\nClarinda\'s kind regards. To remind Major Fitz-David of his appointment."\r\nAnother lady! This time a lady with a title. A great lady who sent\r\nher flowers and her messages without condescending to concealment. The\r\nMajor--first apologizing to me--wrote a few lines of acknowledgment,\r\nand sent them out to the messenger. When the door was closed again he\r\ncarefully selected one of the choicest flowers in the nosegay. "May I\r\nask," he said, presenting the flower to me with his best grace, "whether\r\nyou now understand the delicate position in which I am placed between\r\nyour husband and yourself?"\r\n\r\nThe little interruption caused by the appearance of the nosegay had\r\ngiven a new impulse to my thoughts, and had thus helped, in some degree,\r\nto restore me to myself. I was able at last to satisfy Major Fitz-David\r\nthat his considerate and courteous explanation had not been thrown away\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\n"I thank you, most sincerely, Major," I said "You have convinced me that\r\nI must not ask you to forget, on my account, the promise which you have\r\ngiven to my husband. It is a sacred promise, which I too am bound to\r\nrespect--I quite understand that."\r\n\r\nThe Major drew a long breath of relief, and patted me on the shoulder in\r\nhigh approval of what I had said to him.\r\n\r\n"Admirably expressed!" he rejoined, recovering his light-hearted looks\r\nand his lover-like ways all in a moment. "My dear lady, you have the\r\ngift of sympathy; you see exactly how I am situated. Do you know, you\r\nremind me of my charming Lady Clarinda. _She_ has the gift of sympathy,\r\nand sees exactly how I am situated. I should so enjoy introducing you\r\nto each other," said the Major, plunging his long nose ecstatically into\r\nLady Clarinda\'s flowers.\r\n\r\nI had my end still to gain; and, being (as you will have discovered by\r\nthis time) the most obstinate of living women, I still kept that end in\r\nview.\r\n\r\n"I shall be delighted to meet Lady Clarinda," I replied. "In the\r\nmeantime--"\r\n\r\n"I will get up a little dinner," proceeded the Major, with a burst of\r\nenthusiasm. "You and I and Lady Clarinda. Our young prima donna shall\r\ncome in the evening, and sing to us. Suppose we draw out the _menu?_ My\r\nsweet friend, what is your favorite autumn soup?"\r\n\r\n"In the meantime," I persisted, "to return to what we were speaking of\r\njust now--"\r\n\r\nThe Major\'s smile vanished; the Major\'s hand dropped the pen destined to\r\nimmortalize the name of my favorite autumn soup.\r\n\r\n"_Must_ we return to that?" he asked, piteously.\r\n\r\n"Only for a moment," I said.\r\n\r\n"You remind me," pursued Major Fitz-David, shaking his head sadly, "of\r\nanother charming friend of mine--a French friend--Madame Mirliflore. You\r\nare a person of prodigious tenacity of purpose. Madame Mirliflore is a\r\nperson of prodigious tenacity of purpose. She happens to be in London.\r\nShall we have her at our little dinner?" The Major brightened at the\r\nidea, and took up the pen again. "Do tell me," he said, "what _is_ your\r\nfavorite autumn soup?"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," I began, "we were speaking just now--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear me!" cried Major Fitz-David. "Is this the other subject?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--this is the other subject."\r\n\r\nThe Major put down his pen for the second time, and regretfully\r\ndismissed from his mind Madame Mirliflore and the autumn soup.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" he said, with a patient bow and a submissive smile. "You were\r\ngoing to say--"\r\n\r\n"I was going to say," I rejoined, "that your promise only pledges you\r\nnot to tell the secret which my husband is keeping from me. You have\r\ngiven no promise not to answer me if I venture to ask you one or two\r\nquestions."\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David held up his hand warningly, and cast a sly look at me\r\nout of his bright little gray eyes.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" he said. "My sweet friend, stop there! I know where your\r\nquestions will lead me, and what the result will be if I once begin\r\nto answer them. When your husband was here to-day he took occasion to\r\nremind me that I was as weak as water in the hands of a pretty woman.\r\nHe is quite right. I _am_ as weak as water; I can refuse nothing to a\r\npretty woman. Dear and admirable lady, don\'t abuse your influence! don\'t\r\nmake an old soldier false to his word of honor!"\r\n\r\nI tried to say something here in defense of my motives. The Major\r\nclasped his hands entreatingly, and looked at me with a pleading\r\nsimplicity wonderful to see.\r\n\r\n"Why press it?" he asked. "I offer no resistance. I am a lamb--why\r\nsacrifice me? I acknowledge your power; I throw myself on your mercy.\r\nAll the misfortunes of my youth and my manhood have come to me through\r\nwomen. I am not a bit better in my age--I am just as fond of the women\r\nand just as ready to be misled by them as ever, with one foot in the\r\ngrave. Shocking, isn\'t it? But how true! Look at this mark!" He lifted\r\na curl of his beautiful brown wig, and showed me a terrible scar at the\r\nside of his head. "That wound (supposed to be mortal at the time) was\r\nmade by a pistol bullet," he proceeded. "Not received in the service of\r\nmy country--oh dear, no! Received in the service of a much-injured lady,\r\nat the hands of her scoundrel of a husband, in a duel abroad. Well, she\r\nwas worth it." He kissed his hand affectionately to the memory of the\r\ndead or absent lady, and pointed to a water-color drawing of a pretty\r\ncountry-house hanging on the opposite wall. "That fine estate," he\r\nproceeded, "once belonged to me. It was sold years and years since. And\r\nwho had the money? The women--God bless them all!--the women. I don\'t\r\nregret it. If I had another estate, I have no doubt it would go the same\r\nway. Your adorable sex has made its pretty playthings of my life, my\r\ntime, and my money--and welcome! The one thing I have kept to myself\r\nis my honor. And now _that_ is in danger. Yes, if you put your clever\r\nlittle questions, with those lovely eyes and with that gentle voice, I\r\nknow what will happen. You will deprive me of the last and best of all\r\nmy possessions. Have I deserved to be treated in that way, and by you,\r\nmy charming friend?--by you, of all people in the world? Oh, fie! fie!"\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked at me as before--the picture of artless entreaty,\r\nwith his head a little on one side. I made another attempt to speak\r\nof the matter in dispute between us, from my own point of view. Major\r\nFitz-David instantly threw himself prostrate on my mercy more innocently\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n"Ask of me anything else in the wide world," he said; "but don\'t ask me\r\nto be false to my friend. Spare me _that_--and there is nothing I will\r\nnot do to satisfy you. I mean what I say, mind!" he went on, bending\r\ncloser to me, and speaking more seriously than he had spoken yet "I\r\nthink you are very hardly used. It is monstrous to expect that a woman,\r\nplaced in your situation, will consent to be left for the rest of her\r\nlife in the dark. No! no! if I saw you, at this moment, on the point\r\nof finding out for yourself what Eustace persists in hiding from you, I\r\nshould remember that my promise, like all other promises, has its\r\nlimits and reserves. I should consider myself bound in honor not to help\r\nyou--but I would not lift a finger to prevent you from discovering the\r\ntruth for yourself."\r\n\r\nAt last he was speaking in good earnest: he laid a strong emphasis on\r\nhis closing words. I laid a stronger emphasis on them still by suddenly\r\nleaving my chair. The impulse to spring to my feet was irresistible.\r\nMajor Fitz-David had started a new idea in my mind.\r\n\r\n"Now we understand each other!" I said. "I will accept your own terms,\r\nMajor. I will ask nothing of you but what you have just offered to me of\r\nyour own accord."\r\n\r\n"What have I offered?" he inquired, looking a little alarmed.\r\n\r\n"Nothing that you need repent of," I answered; "nothing which is not\r\neasy for you to grant. May I ask a bold question? Suppose this house was\r\nmine instead of yours?"\r\n\r\n"Consider it yours," cried the gallant old gentleman. "From the garret\r\nto the kitchen, consider it yours!"\r\n\r\n"A thousand thanks, Major; I will consider it mine for the moment.\r\nYou know--everybody knows--that one of a woman\'s many weaknesses is\r\ncuriosity. Suppose my curiosity led me to examine everything in my new\r\nhouse?"\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose I went from room to room, and searched everything, and peeped\r\nin everywhere? Do you think there would be any chance--"\r\n\r\nThe quick-witted Major anticipated the nature of my question. He\r\nfollowed my example; he too started to his feet, with a new idea in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"Would there be any chance," I went on, "of my finding my own way to\r\nmy husband\'s secret in this house? One word of reply, Major Fitz-David!\r\nOnly one word--Yes or No?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t excite yourself!" cried the Major.\r\n\r\n"Yes or No?" I repeated, more vehemently than ever.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Major, after a moment\'s consideration.\r\n\r\nIt was the reply I had asked for; but it was not explicit enough, now\r\nI had got it, to satisfy me. I felt the necessity of leading him (if\r\npossible) into details.\r\n\r\n"Does \'Yes\' mean that there is some sort of clew to the mystery?" I\r\nasked. "Something, for instance, which my eyes might see and my hands\r\nmight touch if I could only find it?"\r\n\r\nHe considered again. I saw that I had succeeded in interesting him in\r\nsome way unknown to myself; and I waited patiently until he was prepared\r\nto answer me.\r\n\r\n"The thing you mention," he said, "the clew (as you call it), might be\r\nseen and might be touched--supposing you could find it."\r\n\r\n"In this house?" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe Major advanced a step nearer to me, and answered--\r\n\r\n"In this room."\r\n\r\nMy head began to swim; my heart throbbed violently. I tried to speak;\r\nit was in vain; the effort almost choked me. In the silence I could\r\nhear the music-lesson still going on in the room above. The future prima\r\ndonna had done practicing her scales, and was trying her voice now in\r\nselections from Italian operas. At the moment when I first heard her\r\nshe was singing the beautiful air from the _Somnambula,_ "Come per me\r\nsereno." I never hear that delicious melody, to this day, without being\r\ninstantly transported in imagination to the fatal back-room in Vivian\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\nThe Major--strongly affected himself by this time--was the first to\r\nbreak the silence.\r\n\r\n"Sit down again," he said; "and pray take the easy-chair. You are very\r\nmuch agitated; you want rest."\r\n\r\nHe was right. I could stand no longer; I dropped into the chair. Major\r\nFitz-David rang the bell, and spoke a few words to the servant at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"I have been here a long time," I said, faintly. "Tell me if I am in the\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"In the way?" he repeated, with his irresistible smile. "You forget that\r\nyou are in your own house!"\r\n\r\nThe servant returned to us, bringing with him a tiny bottle of champagne\r\nand a plateful of delicate little sugared biscuits.\r\n\r\n"I have had this wine bottled expressly for the ladies," said the Major.\r\n"The biscuits came to me direct from Paris. As a favor to _me,_ you\r\nmust take some refreshment. And then--" He stopped and looked at me very\r\nattentively. "And then," he resumed, "shall I go to my young prima donna\r\nupstairs and leave you here alone?"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to hint more delicately at the one request which I\r\nnow had it in my mind to make to him. I took his hand and pressed it\r\ngratefully.\r\n\r\n"The tranquillity of my whole life to come is at stake," I said. "When I\r\nam left here by myself, does your generous sympathy permit me to examine\r\neverything in the room?"\r\n\r\nHe signed to me to drink the champagne and eat a biscuit before he gave\r\nhis answer.\r\n\r\n"This is serious," he said. "I wish you to be in perfect possession of\r\nyourself. Restore your strength--and then I will speak to you."\r\n\r\nI did as he bade me. In a minute from the time when I drank it the\r\ndelicious sparkling wine had begun to revive me.\r\n\r\n"Is it your express wish," he resumed, "that I should leave you here by\r\nyourself to search the room?"\r\n\r\n"It is my express wish," I answered.\r\n\r\n"I take a heavy responsibility on myself in granting your request. But I\r\ngrant it for all that, because I sincerely believe--as you believe--that\r\nthe tranquillity of your life to come depends on your discovering the\r\ntruth." Saying those words, he took two keys from his pocket. "You will\r\nnaturally feel a suspicion," he went on, "of any locked doors that you\r\nmay find here. The only locked places in the room are the doors of the\r\ncupboards under the long book-case, and the door of the Italian cabinet\r\nin that corner. The small key opens the book-case cupboards; the long\r\nkey opens the cabinet door."\r\n\r\nWith that explanation, he laid the keys before me on the table.\r\n\r\n"Thus far," he said, "I have rigidly respected the promise which I made\r\nto your husband. I shall continue to be faithful to my promise, whatever\r\nmay be the result of your examination of the room. I am bound in honor\r\nnot to assist you by word or deed. I am not even at liberty to offer you\r\nthe slightest hint. Is that understood?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly!"\r\n\r\n"Very good. I have now a last word of warning to give you--and then I\r\nhave done. If you do by any chance succeed in laying your hand on the\r\nclew, remember this--_the discovery which follows will be a terrible\r\none._ If you have any doubt about your capacity to sustain a shock which\r\nwill strike you to the soul, for God\'s sake give up the idea of finding\r\nout your husband\'s secret at once and forever!"\r\n\r\n"I thank you for your warning, Major. I must face the consequences of\r\nmaking the discovery, whatever they may be."\r\n\r\n"You are positively resolved?"\r\n\r\n"Positively."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Take any time you please. The house, and every person in it,\r\nare at your disposal. Ring the bell once if you want the man-servant.\r\nRing twice if you wish the housemaid to wait on you. From time to time I\r\nshall just look in myself to see how you are going on. I am responsible\r\nfor your comfort and security, you know, while you honor me by remaining\r\nunder my roof."\r\n\r\nHe lifted my hand to his lips, and fixed a last attentive look on me.\r\n\r\n"I hope I am not running too great a risk," he said--more to himself\r\nthan to me. "The women have led me into many a rash action in my time.\r\nHave _you_ led me, I wonder, into the rashest action of all?"\r\n\r\nWith those ominous last words he bowed gravely and left me alone in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE SEARCH.\r\n\r\nTHE fire burning in the grate was not a very large one; and the outer\r\nair (as I had noticed on my way to the house) had something of a wintry\r\nsharpness in it that day.\r\n\r\nStill, my first feeling, when Major Fitz-David left me, was a feeling of\r\nheat and oppression, with its natural result, a difficulty in breathing\r\nfreely. The nervous agitation of the time was, I suppose, answerable for\r\nthese sensations. I took off my bonnet and mantle and gloves, and opened\r\nthe window for a little while. Nothing was to be seen outside but a\r\npaved courtyard, with a skylight in the middle, closed at the further\r\nend by the wall of the Major\'s stables. A few minutes at the window\r\ncooled and refreshed me. I shut it down again, and took my first step\r\non the way of discovery. In other words, I began my first examination of\r\nthe four walls around me, and of all that they inclosed.\r\n\r\nI was amazed at my own calmness. My interview with Major Fitz-David had,\r\nperhaps, exhausted my capacity for feeling any strong emotion, for the\r\ntime at least. It was a relief to me to be alone; it was a relief to me\r\nto begin the search. Those were my only sensations so far.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the room was oblong. Of the two shorter walls, one\r\ncontained the door in grooves which I have already mentioned as\r\ncommunicating with the front room; the other was almost entirely\r\noccupied by the broad window which looked out on the courtyard.\r\n\r\nTaking the doorway wall first, what was there, in the shape of\r\nfurniture, on either side of it? There was a card-table on either side.\r\nAbove each card-table stood a magnificent china bowl placed on a gilt\r\nand carved bracket fixed to the wall.\r\n\r\nI opened the card-tables. The drawers beneath contained nothing but\r\ncards, and the usual counters and markers. With the exception of one\r\npack, the cards in both tables were still wrapped in their paper covers\r\nexactly as they had come from the shop. I examined the loose pack, card\r\nby card. No writing, no mark of any kind, was visible on any one of\r\nthem. Assisted by a library ladder which stood against the book-case,\r\nI looked next into the two china bowls. Both were perfectly empty. Was\r\nthere anything more to examine on that side of the room? In the two\r\ncorners there were two little chairs of inlaid wood, with red silk\r\ncushions. I turned them up and looked under the cushions, and still I\r\nmade no discoveries. When I had put the chairs back in their places my\r\nsearch on one side of the room was complete. So far I had found nothing.\r\n\r\nI crossed to the opposite wall, the wall which contained the window.\r\n\r\nThe window (occupying, as I have said, almost the entire length and\r\nheight of the wall) was divided into three compartments, and was adorned\r\nat their extremity by handsome curtains of dark red velvet. The ample\r\nheavy folds of the velvet left just room at the two corners of the wall\r\nfor two little upright cabinets in buhl, containing rows of drawers, and\r\nsupporting two fine bronze productions (reduced in size) of the Venus\r\nMilo and the Venus Callipyge. I had Major Fitz-David\'s permission to\r\ndo just what I pleased. I opened the si x drawers in each cabinet, and\r\nexamined their contents without hesitation.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the cabinet in the right-hand corner, my investigations\r\nwere soon completed. All the six drawers were alike occupied by a\r\ncollection of fossils, which (judging by the curious paper inscriptions\r\nfixed on some of them) were associated with a past period of the Major\'s\r\nlife when he had speculated, not very successfully in mines. After\r\nsatisfying myself that the drawers contained nothing but the fossils\r\nand their inscriptions, I turned to the cabinet in the left-hand corner\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nHere a variety of objects was revealed to view, and the examination\r\naccordingly occupied a much longer time.\r\n\r\nThe top drawer contained a complete collection of carpenter\'s tools in\r\nminiature, relics probably of the far-distant time when the Major was a\r\nboy, and when parents or friends had made him a present of a set of toy\r\ntools. The second drawer was filled with toys of another sort--presents\r\nmade to Major Fitz-David by his fair friends. Embroidered braces, smart\r\nsmoking-caps, quaint pincushions, gorgeous slippers, glittering purses,\r\nall bore witness to the popularity of the friend of the women. The\r\ncontents of the third drawer were of a less interesting sort: the entire\r\nspace was filled with old account-books, ranging over a period of\r\nmany years. After looking into each book, and opening and shaking it\r\nuselessly, in search of any loose papers which might be hidden between\r\nthe leaves, I came to the fourth drawer, and found more relics of past\r\npecuniary transactions in the shape of receipted bills, neatly tied\r\ntogether, and each inscribed at the back. Among the bills I found nearly\r\na dozen loose papers, all equally unimportant. The fifth drawer was in\r\nsad confusion. I took out first a loose bundle of ornamental cards, each\r\ncontaining the list of dishes at past banquets given or attended by the\r\nMajor in London or Paris; next, a box full of delicately tinted quill\r\npens (evidently a lady\'s gift); next, a quantity of old invitation\r\ncards; next, some dog\'s-eared French plays and books of the opera; next,\r\na pocket-corkscrew, a bundle of cigarettes, and a bunch of rusty keys;\r\nlastly, a passport, a set of luggage labels, a broken silver snuff-box,\r\ntwo cigar-cases, and a torn map of Rome. "Nothing anywhere to interest\r\nme," I thought, as I closed the fifth, and opened the sixth and last\r\ndrawer.\r\n\r\nThe sixth drawer was at once a surprise and a disappointment. It\r\nliterally contained nothing but the fragments of a broken vase.\r\n\r\nI was sitting, at the time, opposite to the cabinet, in a low chair. In\r\nthe momentary irritation caused by my discovery of the emptiness of the\r\nlast drawer, I had just lifted my foot to push it back into its place,\r\nwhen the door communicating with the hall opened, and Major Fitz-David\r\nstood before me.\r\n\r\nHis eyes, after first meeting mine, traveled downward to my foot. The\r\ninstant he noticed the open drawer I saw a change in his face. It was\r\nonly for a moment; but in that moment he looked at me with a sudden\r\nsuspicion and surprise--looked as if he had caught me with my hand on\r\nthe clew.\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t let me disturb you," said Major Fitz-David. "I have only\r\ncome here to ask you a question."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Major?"\r\n\r\n"Have you met with any letters of mine in the course of your\r\ninvestigations?"\r\n\r\n"I have found none yet," I answered. "If I do discover any letters, I\r\nshall, of course, not take the liberty of examining them."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to speak to you about that," he rejoined. "It only struck me\r\na moment since, upstairs, that my letters might embarrass you. In your\r\nplace I should feel some distrust of anything which I was not at liberty\r\nto examine. I think I can set this matter right, however, with very\r\nlittle trouble to either of us. It is no violation of any promises or\r\npledges on my part if I simply tell you that my letters will not assist\r\nthe discovery which you are trying to make. You can safely pass them\r\nover as objects that are not worth examining from your point of view.\r\nYou understand me, I am sure?"\r\n\r\n"I am much obliged to you, Major--I quite understand."\r\n\r\n"Are you feeling any fatigue?"\r\n\r\n"None whatever, thank you."\r\n\r\n"And you still hope to succeed? You are not beginning to be discouraged\r\nalready?"\r\n\r\n"I am not in the least discouraged. With your kind leave, I mean to\r\npersevere for some time yet."\r\n\r\nI had not closed the drawer of the cabinet while we were talking, and\r\nI glanced carelessly, as I answered him, at the fragments of the broken\r\nvase. By this time he had got his feelings under perfect command. He,\r\ntoo, glanced at the fragments of the vase with an appearance of perfect\r\nindifference. I remembered the look of suspicion and surprise that\r\nhad escaped him on entering the room, and I thought his indifference a\r\nlittle overacted.\r\n\r\n"_That_ doesn\'t look very encouraging," he said, with a smile, pointing\r\nto the shattered pieces of china in the drawer.\r\n\r\n"Appearances are not always to be trusted," I replied. "The wisest thing\r\nI can do in my present situation is to suspect everything, even down to\r\na broken vase."\r\n\r\nI looked hard at him as I spoke. He changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"Does the music upstairs annoy you?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Not in the least, Major."\r\n\r\n"It will soon be over now. The singing-master is going, and the Italian\r\nmaster has just arrived. I am sparing no pains to make my young prima\r\ndonna a most accomplished person. In learning to sing she must also\r\nlearn the language which is especially the language of music. I shall\r\nperfect her in the accent when I take her to Italy. It is the height\r\nof my ambition to have her mistaken for an Italian when she sings in\r\npublic. Is there anything I can do before I leave you again? May I send\r\nyou some more champagne? Please say yes!"\r\n\r\n"A thousand thanks, Major. No more champagne for the present."\r\n\r\nHe turned at the door to kiss his hand to me at parting. At the same\r\nmoment I saw his eyes wander slyly toward the book-case. It was only for\r\nan instant. I had barely detected him before he was out of the room.\r\n\r\nLeft by myself again, I looked at the book-case--looked at it\r\nattentively for the first time.\r\n\r\nIt was a handsome piece of furniture in ancient carved oak, and it\r\nstood against the wall which ran parallel with the hall of the house.\r\nExcepting the space occupied in the upper corner of the room by the\r\nsecond door, which opened into the hall, the book-case filled the whole\r\nlength of the wall down to the window. The top was ornamented by vases,\r\ncandelabra, and statuettes, in pairs, placed in a row. Looking along\r\nthe row, I noticed a vacant space on the top of the bookcase at the\r\nextremity of it which was nearest to the window. The opposite extremity,\r\nnearest to the door, was occupied by a handsome painted vase of a very\r\npeculiar pattern. Where was the corresponding vase, which ought to have\r\nbeen placed at the corresponding extremity of the book-case? I returned\r\nto the open sixth drawer of the cabinet, and looked in again. There was\r\nno mistaking the pattern on the fragments when I examined them now. The\r\nvase which had been broken was the vase which had stood in the place now\r\nvacant on the top of the book-case at the end nearest to the window.\r\n\r\nMaking this discovery, I took out the fragments, down to the smallest\r\nmorsel of the shattered china, and examined them carefully one after\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nI was too ignorant of the subject to be able to estimate the value of\r\nthe vase or the antiquity of the vase, or even to know whether it were\r\nof British or of foreign manufacture. The ground was of a delicate\r\ncream-color. The ornaments traced on this were wreaths of flowers and\r\nCupids surrounding a medallion on either side of the vase. Upon the\r\nspace within one of the medallions was painted with exquisite delicacy\r\na woman\'s head, representing a nymph or a goddess, or perhaps a portrait\r\nof some celebrated person--I was not learned enough to say which.\r\nThe other medallion inclosed the head of a man, also treated in the\r\nclassical style. Reclining shepherds and shepherdesses in Watteau\r\ncostume, with their dogs and their sheep, formed the adornments of the\r\npedestal. Such had the vase been in the days of its prosperity, when\r\nit stood on the top of the book-case. By what accident had it become\r\nbroken? And why had Major Fitz-David\'s face changed when he found that\r\nI had discovered the remains of his shattered work of art in the cabinet\r\ndrawer?\r\n\r\nThe remains left those serious questions unanswered--the remains told me\r\nabsolutely nothing. And yet, if my own observation of the Major were to\r\nbe trusted, the way to the clew of which I was in search lay, directly\r\nor indirectly, through the broken vase.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to pursue the question, knowing no more than I knew now.\r\nI returned to the book-case.\r\n\r\nThus far I had assumed (without any sufficient reason) that the clew of\r\nwhich I was in search must necessarily reveal itself through a written\r\npaper of some sort. It now occurred to me--after the movement which\r\nI had detected on the part of the Major--that the clew might quite as\r\nprobably present itself in the form of a book.\r\n\r\nI looked along the lower rows of shelves, standing just near enough to\r\nthem to read the titles on the backs of the volumes. I saw Voltaire in\r\nred morocco, Shakespeare in blue, Walter Scott in green, the "History of\r\nEngland" in brown, the "Annual Register" in yellow calf. There I paused,\r\nwearied and discouraged already by the long rows of volumes. How (I\r\nthought to myself) am I to examine all these books? And what am I to\r\nlook for, even if I do examine them all?\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David had spoken of a terrible misfortune which had darkened\r\nmy husband\'s past life. In what possible way could any trace of that\r\nmisfortune, or any suggestive hint of something resembling it, exist in\r\nthe archives of the "Annual Register" or in the pages of Voltaire?\r\nThe bare idea of such a thing seemed absurd The mere attempt to make a\r\nserious examination in this direction was surely a wanton waste of time.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Major had certainly stolen a look at the book-case. And\r\nagain, the broken vase had once stood on the book-case. Did these\r\ncircumstances justify me in connecting the vase and the book-case as\r\ntwin landmarks on the way that led to discovery? The question was not an\r\neasy one to decide on the spur of the moment.\r\n\r\nI looked up at the higher shelves.\r\n\r\nHere the collection of books exhibited a greater variety. The volumes\r\nwere smaller, and were not so carefully arranged as on the lower\r\nshelves. Some were bound in cloth, some were only protected by paper\r\ncovers; one or two had fallen, and lay flat on the shelves. Here and\r\nthere I saw empty spaces from which books had been removed and not\r\nreplaced. In short, there was no discouraging uniformity in these higher\r\nregions of the book-case. The untidy top shelves looked suggestive of\r\nsome lucky accident which might unexpectedly lead the way to success. I\r\ndecided, if I did examine the book-case at all, to begin at the top.\r\n\r\nWhere was the library ladder?\r\n\r\nI had left it against the partition wall which divided the back room\r\nfrom the room in front. Looking that way, I necessarily looked also\r\ntoward the door that ran in grooves--the imperfectly closed door through\r\nwhich I heard Major Fitz-David question his servant on the subject of\r\nmy personal appearance when I first entered the house. No one had moved\r\nthis door during the time of my visit. Everybody entering or leaving the\r\nroom had used the other door, which led into the hall.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when I looked round something stirred in the front room.\r\nThe movement let the light in suddenly through the small open space left\r\nby the partially closed door. Had somebody been watching me through the\r\nchink? I stepped softly to the door, and pushed it back until it was\r\nwide open. There was the Major, discovered in the front room! I saw it\r\nin his face--he had been watching me at the book-case!\r\n\r\nHis hat was in his hand. He was evidently going out; and he dexterously\r\ntook advantage of that circumstance to give a plausible reason for being\r\nso near the door.\r\n\r\n"I hope I didn\'t frighten you," he said.\r\n\r\n"You startled me a little, Major."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry, and so ashamed! I was just going to open the door, and\r\ntell you that I am obliged to go out. I have received a pressing message\r\nfrom a lady. A charming person--I should so like you to know her. She\r\nis in sad trouble, poor thing. Little bills, you know, and nasty\r\ntradespeople who want their money, and a husband--oh, dear me, a husband\r\nwho is quite unworthy of her! A most interesting creature. You remind\r\nme of her a little; you both have the same carriage of the head. I shall\r\nnot be more than half an hour gone. Can I do anything for you? You are\r\nlooking fatigued. Pray let me send for some more champagne. No? Promise\r\nto ring when you want it. That\'s right! _Au revoir_, my charming\r\nfriend--_au revoir!_"\r\n\r\nI pulled the door to again the moment his back was turned, and sat down\r\nfor a while to compose myself.\r\n\r\nHe had been watching me at the book-case! The man who was in my\r\nhusband\'s confidence, the man who knew where the clew was to be found,\r\nhad been watching me at the book-case! There was no doubt of it now.\r\nMajor Fitz-David had shown me the hiding-place of the secret in spite of\r\nhimself!\r\n\r\nI looked with indifference at the other pieces of furniture, ranged\r\nagainst the fourth wall, which I had not examined yet. I surveyed,\r\nwithout the slightest feeling of curiosity, all the little elegant\r\ntrifles scattered on the tables and on the chimney-piece, each one\r\nof which might have been an object of suspicion to me under other\r\ncircumstances. Even the water-color drawings failed to interest me in my\r\npresent frame of mind. I observed languidly that they were most of\r\nthem portraits of ladies--fair idols, no doubt, of the Major\'s facile\r\nadoration--and I cared to notice no more. _My_ business in that room (I\r\nwas certain of it now!) began and ended with the book-case. I left\r\nmy seat to fetch the library ladder, determining to begin the work of\r\ninvestigation on the top shelves.\r\n\r\nOn my way to the ladder I passed one of the tables, and saw the keys\r\nlying on it which Major Fitz-David had left at my disposal.\r\n\r\nThe smaller of the two keys instantly reminded me of the cupboards under\r\nthe bookcase. I had strangely overlooked these. A vague distrust of the\r\nlocked doors a vague doubt of what they might be hiding from me, stole\r\ninto my mind. I left the ladder in its place against the wall, and set\r\nmyself to examine the contents of the cupboards first.\r\n\r\nThe cupboards were three in number. As I opened the first of them\r\nthe singing upstairs ceased. For a moment there was something almost\r\noppressive in the sudden change from noise to silence. I suppose my\r\nnerves must have been overwrought. The next sound in the house--nothing\r\nmore remarkable than the creaking of a man\'s boots descending\r\nthe stairs--made me shudder all over. The man was no doubt the\r\nsinging-master, going away after giving his lesson. I heard the house\r\ndoor close on him, and started at the familiar sound as if it were\r\nsomething terrible which I had never heard before. Then there was\r\nsilence again. I roused myself as well as I could, and began my\r\nexamination of the first cupboard.\r\n\r\nIt was divided into two compartments.\r\n\r\nThe top compartment contained nothing but boxes of cigars, ranged in\r\nrows, one on another. The under compartment was devoted to a collection\r\nof shells. They were all huddled together anyhow, the Major evidently\r\nsetting a far higher value on his cigars than on his shells. I searched\r\nthis lower compartment carefully for any object interesting to me which\r\nmight be hidden in it. Nothing was to be found in any part of it besides\r\nthe shells.\r\n\r\nAs I opened the second cupboard it struck me that the light was\r\nbeginning to fail.\r\n\r\nI looked at the window: it was hardly evening yet. The darkening of the\r\nlight was produced by gathering clouds. Rain-drops pattered against\r\nthe glass; the autumn wind whistled mournfully in the corners of the\r\ncourtyard. I mended the fire before I renewed my search. My nerves were\r\nin fault again, I suppose. I shivered when I went back to the book-case.\r\nMy hands trembled: I wondered what was the matter with me.\r\n\r\nThe second cupboard revealed (in the upper division of it) some really\r\nbeautiful cameos--not mounted, but laid on cotton-wool in neat cardboard\r\ntrays. In one corner, half hidden under one of the trays, there peeped\r\nout the white leaves of a little manuscript. I pounced on it eagerly,\r\nonly to meet with a new disappointment: the manuscript proved to be a\r\ndescriptive catalogue of the cameos--nothing more!\r\n\r\nTurning to the lower division of the cupboard, I found more costly\r\ncuriosities in the shape of ivory carvings from Japan and specimens of\r\nrare silk from China. I began to feel weary of disinterring the Major\'s\r\ntreasures. The longer I searched, the farther I seemed to remove myself\r\nfrom the one object that I had it at heart to attain. After closing the\r\ndoor of the second cupboard, I almost doubted whether it would be worth\r\nmy while to proceed farther and open the third and last door.\r\n\r\nA little reflection convinced me that it would be as well, now that I\r\nhad begun my examination of the lower regions of the book-case, to go on\r\nwith it to the end. I opened the last cupboard.\r\n\r\nOn the upper shelf there appeared, in solitary grandeur, one object\r\nonly--a gorgeously bound book.\r\n\r\nIt was of a larger size than usual, judging of it by comparison with\r\nthe dimensions of modern volumes. The binding was of blue velvet, with\r\nclasps of silver worked in beautiful arabesque patterns, and with a lock\r\nof the same precious metal to protect the book from prying eyes. When I\r\ntook it up, I found that the lock was not closed.\r\n\r\nHad I any right to take advantage of this accident, and open the book?\r\nI have put the question since to some of my friends of both sexes. The\r\nwomen all agree that I was perfectly justified, considering the serious\r\ninterests that I had at stake, in taking any advantage of any book in\r\nthe Major\'s house. The men differ from this view, and declare that I\r\nought to have put back the volume in blue velvet unopened, carefully\r\nguarding myself from any after-temptation to look at it again by locking\r\nthe cupboard door. I dare say the men are right.\r\n\r\nBeing a woman, however, I opened the book without a moment\'s hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe leaves were of the finest vellum, with tastefully designed\r\nilluminations all round them. And what did these highly ornamental pages\r\ncontain? To my unutterable amazement and disgust, they contained locks\r\nof hair, let neatly into the center of each page, with inscriptions\r\nbeneath, which proved them to be love-tokens from various ladies who had\r\ntouched the Major\'s susceptible heart at different periods of his life.\r\nThe inscriptions were written in other languages besides English, but\r\nthey appeared to be all equally devoted to the same curious purpose,\r\nnamely, to reminding the Major of the dates at which his various\r\nattachments had come to an untimely end. Thus the first page exhibited\r\na lock of the lightest flaxen hair, with these lines beneath: "My adored\r\nMadeline. Eternal constancy. Alas, July 22, 1839!" The next page was\r\nadorned by a darker shade of hair, with a French inscription under it:\r\n"Clemence. Idole de mon \xe2me. Toujours fidele. Helas, 2me Avril, 1840." A\r\nlock of red hair followed, with a lamentation in Latin under it, a note\r\nbeing attached to the date of dissolution of partnership in this case,\r\nstating that the lady was descended from the ancient Romans, and was\r\ntherefore mourned appropriately in Latin by her devoted Fitz-David.\r\nMore shades of hair and more inscriptions followed, until I was weary of\r\nlooking at them. I put down the book, disgusted with the creatures\r\nwho had assisted in filling it, and then took it up again, by an\r\nafterthought. Thus far I had thoroughly searched everything that had\r\npresented itself to my notice. Agreeable or not agreeable, it was\r\nplainly of serious importance to my own interests to go on as I had\r\nbegun, and thoroughly to search the book.\r\n\r\nI turned over the pages until I came to the first blank leaf. Seeing\r\nthat they were all blank leaves from this place to the end, I lifted the\r\nvolume by the back, and, as a last measure of precaution, shook it so as\r\nto dislodge any loose papers or cards which might have escaped my notice\r\nbetween the leaves.\r\n\r\nThis time my patience was rewarded by a discovery which indescribably\r\nirritated and distressed me.\r\n\r\nA small photograph, mounted on a card, fell out of the book. A first\r\nglance showed me that it represented the portraits of two persons.\r\n\r\nOne of the persons I recognized as my husband.\r\n\r\nThe other person was a woman.\r\n\r\nHer face was entirely unknown to me. She was not young. The picture\r\nrepresented her seated on a chair, with my husband standing behind, and\r\nbending over her, holding one of her hands in his. The woman\'s face was\r\nhard-featured and ugly, with the marking lines of strong passions and\r\nresolute self-will plainly written on it. Still, ugly as she was, I felt\r\na pang of jealousy as I noticed the familiarly affectionate action by\r\nwhich the artist (with the permission of his sitters, of course) had\r\nconnected the two figures in a group. Eustace had briefly told me, in\r\nthe days of our courtship, that he had more than once fancied himself\r\nto be in love before he met with me. Could this very unattractive woman\r\nhave been one of the early objects of his admiration? Had she been near\r\nenough and dear enough to him to be photographed with her hand in his? I\r\nlooked and looked at the portraits until I could endure them no longer.\r\nWomen are strange creatures--mysteries even to themselves. I threw the\r\nphotograph from me into a corner of the cupboard. I was savagely angry\r\nwith my husband; I hated--yes, hated with all my heart and soul!--the\r\nwoman who had got his hand in hers--the unknown woman with the\r\nself-willed, hard-featured face.\r\n\r\nAll this time the lower shelf of the cupboard was still waiting to be\r\nlooked over.\r\n\r\nI knelt down to examine it, eager to clear my mind, if I could, of the\r\ndegrading jealousy that had got possession of me.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the lower shelf contained nothing but relics of the\r\nMajor\'s military life, comprising his sword and pistols, his epaulets,\r\nhis sash, and other minor accouterments. None of these objects excited\r\nthe slightest interest in me. My eyes wandered back to the upper\r\nshelf; and, like the fool I was (there is no milder word that can\r\nfitly describe me at that moment), I took the photograph out again, and\r\nenraged myself uselessly by another look at it. This time I observed,\r\nwhat I had not noticed before, that there were some lines of writing (in\r\na woman\'s hand) at the back of the portraits. The lines ran thus:\r\n\r\n"To Major Fitz-David, with two vases. From his friends, S. and E. M."\r\n\r\nWas one of those two vases the vase that had been broken? And was the\r\nchange that I had noticed in Major Fitz-David\'s face produced by some\r\npast association in connection with it, which in some way affected\r\nme? It might or might not be so. I was little disposed to indulge in\r\nspeculation on this topic while the far more serious question of the\r\ninitials confronted me on the back of the photograph.\r\n\r\n"S. and E. M.?" Those last two letters might stand for the initials of\r\nmy husband\'s name--his true name--Eustace Macallan. In this case the\r\nfirst letter ("S.") in all probability indicated _her_ name. What right\r\nhad she to associate herself with him in that manner? I considered a\r\nlittle--my memory exerted itself--I suddenly called to mind that Eustace\r\nhad sisters. He had spoken of them more than once in the time before our\r\nmarriage. Had I been mad enough to torture myself with jealousy of my\r\nhusband\'s sister? It might well be so; "S." might stand for his sister\'s\r\nChristian name. I felt heartily ashamed of myself as this new view of\r\nthe matter dawned on me. What a wrong I had done to them both in my\r\nthoughts! I turned the photograph, sadly and penitently, to examine the\r\nportraits again with a kinder and truer appreciation of them.\r\n\r\nI naturally looked now for a family likeness between the two faces.\r\nThere was no family likeness; on the contrary, they were as unlike each\r\nother in form and expression as faces could be. _Was_ she his sister,\r\nafter all? I looked at her hands, as represented in the portrait. Her\r\nright hand was clasped by Eustace; her left hand lay on her lap. On the\r\nthird finger, distinctly visible, there was a wedding-ring. Were any of\r\nmy husband\'s sisters married? I had myself asked him the question when\r\nhe mentioned them to me, and I perfectly remembered that he had replied\r\nin the negative.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that my first jealous instinct had led me to the right\r\nconclusion after all? If it had, what did the association of the three\r\ninitial letters mean? What did the wedding-ring mean? Good Heavens! was\r\nI looking at the portrait of a rival in my husband\'s affections--and was\r\nthat rival his Wife?\r\n\r\nI threw the photograph from me with a cry of horror. For one terrible\r\nmoment I felt as if my reason was giving way. I don\'t know what would\r\nhave happened, or what I should have done next, if my love for Eustace\r\nhad not taken the uppermost place among the contending emotions that\r\ntortured me. That faithful love steadied my brain. That faithful love\r\nroused the reviving influences of my better and nobler sense. Was the\r\nman whom I had enshrined in my heart of hearts capable of such base\r\nwickedness as the bare idea of his marriage to another woman implied?\r\nNo! Mine was the baseness, mine the wickedness, in having even for a\r\nmoment thought it of him!\r\n\r\nI picked up the detestable photograph from the floor, and put it back\r\nin the book. I hastily closed the cupboard door, fetched the library\r\nladder, and set it against the book-case. My one idea now was the idea\r\nof taking refuge in employment of any sort from my own thoughts. I felt\r\nthe hateful suspicion that had degraded me coming back again in spite of\r\nmy efforts to repel it. The books! the books! my only hope was to absorb\r\nmyself, body and soul, in the books.\r\n\r\nI had one foot on the ladder, when I heard the door of the room\r\nopen--the door which communicated with the hall.\r\n\r\nI looked around, expecting to see the Major. I saw instead the Major\'s\r\nfuture prima donna standing just inside the door, with her round eyes\r\nsteadily fixed on me.\r\n\r\n"I can stand a good deal," the girl began, coolly, "but I can\'t stand\r\n_this_ any longer?"\r\n\r\n"What is it that you can\'t stand any longer?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"If you have been here a minute, you have been here two good hours,"\r\nshe went on. "All by yourself in the Major\'s study. I am of a jealous\r\ndisposition--I am. And I want to know what it means." She advanced a few\r\nsteps nearer to me, with a heightening color and a threatening look. "Is\r\nhe going to bring _you_ out on the stage?" she asked, sharply.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"He ain\'t in love with you, is he?"\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances I might have told her to leave the room. In my\r\nposition at that critical moment the mere presence of a human creature\r\nwas a positive relief to me. Even this girl, with her coarse questions\r\nand her uncultivated manners, was a welcome intruder on my solitude: she\r\noffered me a refuge from myself.\r\n\r\n"Your question is not very civilly put," I said. "However, I excuse you.\r\nYou are probably not aware that I am a married woman."\r\n\r\n"What has that got to do with it?" she retorted. "Married or single,\r\nit\'s all one to the Major. That brazen-faced hussy who calls herself\r\nLady Clarinda is married, and she sends him nosegays three times a\r\nweek! Not that I care, mind you, about the old fool. But I\'ve lost my\r\nsituation at the railway, and I\'ve got my own interests to look after,\r\nand I don\'t know what may happen if I let other women come between him\r\nand me. That\'s where the shoe pinches, don\'t you see? I\'m not easy in my\r\nmind when I see him leaving you mistress here to do just what you like.\r\nNo offense! I speak out--I do. I want to know what you are about all by\r\nyourself in this room? How did you pick up with the Major? I never heard\r\nhim speak of you before to-day."\r\n\r\nUnder all the surface selfishness and coarseness of this strange girl\r\nthere was a certain frankness and freedom which pleaded in her favor--to\r\nmy mind, at any rate. I answered frankly and freely on my side.\r\n\r\n"Major Fitz-David is an old friend of my husband\'s," I said, "and he is\r\nkind to me for my husband\'s sake. He has given me permission to look in\r\nthis room--"\r\n\r\nI stopped, at a loss how to describe my employment in terms which should\r\ntell her nothing, and which should at the same time successfully set her\r\ndistrust of me at rest.\r\n\r\n"To look about in this room--for what?" she asked. Her eye fell on the\r\nlibrary ladder, beside which I was still standing. "For a book?" she\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, taking the hint. "For a book."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you found it yet?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nShe looked hard at me, undisguisedly considering with herself whether I\r\nwere or were not speaking the truth.\r\n\r\n"You seem to be a good sort," she said, making up her mind at last.\r\n"There\'s nothing stuck-up about you. I\'ll help you if I can. I have\r\nrummaged among the books here over and over again, and I know more about\r\nthem than you do. What book do you want?"\r\n\r\nAs she put that awkward question she noticed for the first time Lady\r\nClarinda\'s nosegay lying on the side-table where the Major had left it.\r\nInstantly forgetting me and my book, this curious girl pounced like a\r\nfury on the flowers, and actually trampled them under her feet!\r\n\r\n"There!" she cried. "If I had Lady Clarinda here I\'d serve her in the\r\nsame way."\r\n\r\n"What will the Major say?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"What do I care? Do you suppose I\'m afraid of _him?_ Only last week I\r\nbroke one of his fine gimcracks up there, and all through Lady Clarinda\r\nand her flowers!"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the top of the book-case--to the empty space on it\r\nclose by the window. My heart gave a sudden bound as my eyes took the\r\ndirection indicated by her finger. _She_ had broken the vase! Was the\r\nway to discovery about to reveal itself to me through this girl? Not a\r\nword would pass my lips; I could only look at her.\r\n\r\n"Yes!" she said. "The thing stood there. He knows how I hate her\r\nflowers, and he put her nosegay in the vase out of my way. There was\r\na woman\'s face painted on the china, and he told me it was the living\r\nimage of _her_ face. It was no more like her than I am. I was in such a\r\nrage that I up with the book I was reading at the time and shied it at\r\nthe painted face. Over the vase went, bless your heart, crash to the\r\nfloor. Stop a bit! I wonder whether _that\'s_ the book you have been\r\nlooking after? Are you like me? Do you like reading Trials?"\r\n\r\nTrials? Had I heard her aright? Yes: she had said Trials.\r\n\r\nI answered by an affirmative motion of my head. I was still speechless.\r\nThe girl sauntered in her cool way to the fire-place, and, taking up the\r\ntongs, returned with them to the book-case.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s where the book fell," she said--"in the space between the\r\nbook-case and the wall. I\'ll have it out in no time."\r\n\r\nI waited without moving a muscle, without uttering a word.\r\n\r\nShe approached me with the tongs in one hand and with a plainly bound\r\nvolume in the other.\r\n\r\n"Is that the book?" she said. "Open it, and see."\r\n\r\nI took the book from her.\r\n\r\n"It is tremendously interesting," she went on. "I\'ve read it twice\r\nover--I have. Mind you, _I_ believe he did it, after all."\r\n\r\nDid it? Did what? What was she talking about? I tried to put the\r\nquestion to her. I struggled--quite vainly--to say only these words:\r\n"What are you talking about?"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to lose all patience with me. She snatched the book out of\r\nmy hand, and opened it before me on the table by which we were standing\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\n"I declare, you\'re as helpless as a baby!" she said, contemptuously.\r\n"There! _Is_ that the book?"\r\n\r\nI read the first lines on the title-page--\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE REPORT OF THE TRIAL OF EUSTACE MACALLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI stopped and looked up at her. She started back from me with a scream\r\nof terror. I looked down again at the title-page, and read the next\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE ALLEGED POISONING OF HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\nThere, God\'s mercy remembered me. There the black blank of a swoon\r\nswallowed me up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE RETURN TO LIFE.\r\n\r\nMy first remembrance when I began to recover my senses was the\r\nremembrance of Pain--agonizing pain, as if every nerve in my body were\r\nbeing twisted and torn out of me. My whole being writhed and quivered\r\nunder the dumb and dreadful protest of Nature against the effort to\r\nrecall me to life. I would have given worlds to be able to cry out--to\r\nentreat the unseen creatures about me to give me back to death. How long\r\nthat speechless agony held me I never knew. In a longer or shorter time\r\nthere stole over me slowly a sleepy sense of relief. I heard my own\r\nlabored breathing. I felt my hands moving feebly and mechanically, like\r\nthe hands of a baby. I faintly opened my eyes and looked round me--as if\r\nI had passed through the ordeal of death, and had awakened to new senses\r\nin a new world.\r\n\r\nThe first person I saw was a man--a stranger. He moved quietly out of my\r\nsight; beckoning, as he disappeared, to some other person in the room.\r\n\r\nSlowly and unwillingly the other person advanced to the sofa on which I\r\nlay. A faint cry of joy escaped me; I tried to hold out my feeble hands.\r\nThe other person who was approaching me was my husband!\r\n\r\nI looked at him eagerly. He never looked at me in return. With his eyes\r\non the ground, with a strange appearance of confusion and distress in\r\nhis face, he too moved away out of my sight. The unknown man whom I had\r\nfirst noticed followed him out of the room. I called after him faintly,\r\n"Eustace!" He never answered; he never returned. With an effort I moved\r\nmy head on the pillow, so as to look round on the other side of the\r\nsofa. Another familiar face appeared before me as if in a dream. My good\r\nold Benjamin was sitting watching me, with the tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe rose and took my hand silently, in his simple, kindly way.\r\n\r\n"Where is Eustace?" I asked. "Why has he gone away and left me?"\r\n\r\nI was still miserably weak. My eyes wandered mechanically round the room\r\nas I put the question. I saw Major Fitz-David, I saw the table on which\r\nthe singing girl had opened the book to show it to me. I saw the girl\r\nherself, sitting alone in a corner, with her handkerchief to her eyes\r\nas if she were crying. In one mysterious moment my memory recovered its\r\npowers. The recollection of that fatal title-page came back to me in all\r\nits horror. The one feeling that it roused in me now was a longing to\r\nsee my husband--to throw myself into his arms, and tell him how firmly I\r\nbelieved in his innocence, how truly and dearly I loved him. I seized on\r\nBenjamin with feeble, trembling hands. "Bring him back to me!" I cried,\r\nwildly. "Where is he? Help me to get up!"\r\n\r\nA strange voice answered, firmly and kindly: "Compose yourself, madam.\r\nMr. Woodville is waiting until you have recovered, in a room close by."\r\n\r\nI looked at him, and recognized the stranger who had followed my husband\r\nout of the room. Why had he returned alone? Why was Eustace not with me,\r\nlike the rest of them? I tried to raise myself, and get on my feet.\r\nThe stranger gently pressed me back again on the pillow. I attempted to\r\nresist him--quite uselessly, of course. His firm hand held me as gently\r\nas ever in my place.\r\n\r\n"You must rest a little," he said. "You must take some wine. If you\r\nexert yourself now you will faint again."\r\n\r\nOld Benjamin stooped over me, and whispered a word of explanation.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the doctor, my dear. You must do as he tells you."\r\n\r\nThe doctor! They had called the doctor in to help them! I began dimly\r\nto understand that my fainting fit must have presented symptoms far more\r\nserious than the fainting fits of women in general. I appealed to the\r\ndoctor, in a helpless, querulous way, to account to me for my husband\'s\r\nextraordinary absence.\r\n\r\n"Why did you let him leave the room?" I asked. "If I can\'t go to him,\r\nwhy don\'t you bring him here to me?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor appeared to be at a loss how to reply to me. He looked at\r\nBenjamin, and said, "Will you speak to Mrs. Woodville?"\r\n\r\nBenjamin, in his turn, looked at Major Fitz-David, and said, "Will\r\n_you?_" The Major signed to them both to leave us. They rose together,\r\nand went into the front room, pulling the door to after them in its\r\ngrooves. As they left us, the girl who had so strangely revealed my\r\nhusband\'s secret to me rose in her corner and approached the sofa.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I had better go too?" she said, addressing Major Fitz-David.\r\n\r\n"If you please," the Major answered.\r\n\r\nHe spoke (as I thought) rather coldly. She tossed her head, and turned\r\nher back on him in high indignation. "I must say a word for myself!"\r\ncried this strange creature, with a hysterical outbreak of energy. "I\r\nmust say a word, or I shall burst!"\r\n\r\nWith that extraordinary preface, she suddenly turned my way and poured\r\nout a perfect torrent of words on me.\r\n\r\n"You hear how the Major speaks to me?" she began. "He blames me--poor\r\nMe--for everything that has happened. I am as innocent as the new-born\r\nbabe. I acted for the best. I thought you wanted the book. I don\'t know\r\nnow what made you faint dead away when I opened it. And the Major blames\r\nMe! As if it was my fault! I am not one of the fainting sort myself; but\r\nI feel it, I can tell you. Yes! I feel it, though I don\'t faint about\r\nit. I come of respectable parents--I do. My name is Hoighty--Miss\r\nHoighty. I have my own self-respect; and it\'s wounded. I say my\r\nself-respect is wounded, when I find myself blamed without deserving it.\r\nYou deserve it, if anybody does. Didn\'t you tell me you were looking\r\nfor a book? And didn\'t I present it to you promiscuously, with the\r\nbest intentions? I think you might say so yourself, now the doctor has\r\nbrought you to again. I think you might speak up for a poor girl who is\r\nworked to death with singing and languages and what not--a poor girl who\r\nhas nobody else to speak for her. I am as respectable as you are, if\r\nyou come to that. My name is Hoighty. My parents are in business, and my\r\nmamma has seen better days, and mixed in the best of company."\r\n\r\nThere Miss Hoighty lifted her handkerchief again to her face, and burst\r\nmodestly into tears behind it.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly hard to hold her responsible for what had happened.\r\nI answered as kindly as I could, and I attempted to speak to Major\r\nFitz-David in her defense. He knew what terrible anxieties were\r\noppressing me at that moment; and, considerately refusing to hear a\r\nword, he took the task of consoling his young prima donna entirely on\r\nhimself. What he said to her I neither heard nor cared to hear: he spoke\r\nin a whisper. It ended in his pacifying Miss Hoighty, by kissing her\r\nhand, and leading her (as he might have led a duchess) out of the room.\r\n\r\n"I hope that foolish girl has not annoyed you--at such a time as this,"\r\nhe said, very earnestly, when he returned to the sofa. "I can\'t tell you\r\nhow grieved I am at what has happened. I was careful to warn you, as you\r\nmay remember. Still, if I could only have foreseen--"\r\n\r\nI let him proceed no further. No human forethought could have provided\r\nagainst what had happened. Besides, dreadful as the discovery had been,\r\nI would rather have made it, and suffered under it, as I was suffering\r\nnow, than have been kept in the dark. I told him this. And then I turned\r\nto the one subject that was now of any interest to me--the subject of my\r\nunhappy husband.\r\n\r\n"How did he come to this house?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"He came here with Mr. Benjamin shortly after I returned," the Major\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"Long after I was taken ill?"\r\n\r\n"No. I had just sent for the doctor--feeling seriously alarmed about\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"What brought him here? Did he return to the hotel and miss me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He returned earlier than he had anticipated, and he felt uneasy at\r\nnot finding you at the hotel."\r\n\r\n"Did he suspect me of being with you? Did he come here from the hotel?"\r\n\r\n"No. He appears to have gone first to Mr. Benjamin to inquire about you.\r\nWhat he heard from your old friend I cannot say. I only know that Mr.\r\nBenjamin accompanied him when he came here."\r\n\r\nThis brief explanation was quite enough for me--I understood what had\r\nhappened. Eustace would easily frighten simple old Benjamin about my\r\nabsence from the hotel; and, once alarmed, Benjamin would be persuaded\r\nwithout difficulty to repeat the few words which had passed between us\r\non the subject of Major Fitz-David. My husband\'s presence in the Major\'s\r\nhouse was perfectly explained. But his extraordinary conduct in leaving\r\nthe room at the very time when I was just recovering my senses still\r\nremained to be accounted for. Major Fitz-David looked seriously\r\nembarrassed when I put the question to him.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know how to explain it to you," he said. "Eustace has\r\nsurprised and disappointed me."\r\n\r\nHe spoke very gravely. His looks told me more than his words: his looks\r\nalarmed me.\r\n\r\n"Eustace has not quarreled with you?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Oh no!"\r\n\r\n"He understands that you have not broken your promise to him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. My young vocalist (Miss Hoighty) told the doctor exactly\r\nwhat had happened; and the doctor in her presence repeated the statement\r\nto your husband."\r\n\r\n"Did the doctor see the Trial?"\r\n\r\n"Neither the doctor nor Mr. Benjamin has seen the Trial. I have locked\r\nit up; and I have carefully kept the terrible story of your connection\r\nwith the prisoner a secret from all of them. Mr. Benjamin evidently\r\nhas his suspicions. But the doctor has no idea, and Miss Hoighty has no\r\nidea, of the true cause of your fainting fit. They both believe that you\r\nare subject to serious nervous attacks, and that your husband\'s name is\r\nreally Woodville. All that the truest friend could do to spare Eustace\r\nI have done. He persists, nevertheless, in blaming me for letting you\r\nenter my house. And worse, far worse than this, he persists in declaring\r\nthe event of to-day has fatally estranged you from him. \'There is an end\r\nof our married life,\' he said to me, \'now she knows that I am the man\r\nwho was tried at Edinburgh for poisoning my wife!"\'\r\n\r\nI rose from the sofa in horror.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" I cried, "does Eustace suppose that I doubt his innocence?"\r\n\r\n"He denies that it is possible for you or for anybody to believe in his\r\ninnocence," the Major replied.\r\n\r\n"Help me to the door," I said. "Where is he? I must and will see him!"\r\n\r\nI dropped back exhausted on the sofa as I said the words. Major\r\nFitz-David poured out a glass of wine from the bottle on the table, and\r\ninsisted on my drinking it.\r\n\r\n"You shall see him," said the Major. "I promise you that. The doctor has\r\nforbidden him to leave the house until you have seen him. Only wait a\r\nlittle! My poor, dear lady, wait, if it is only for a few minutes, until\r\nyou are stronger."\r\n\r\nI had no choice but to obey him. Oh, those miserable, helpless\r\nminutes on the sofa! I cannot write of them without shuddering at the\r\nrecollection--even at this distance of time.\r\n\r\n"Bring him here!" I said. "Pray, pray bring him here!"\r\n\r\n"Who is to persuade him to come back?" asked the Major, sadly. "How can\r\nI, how can anybody, prevail with a man--a madman I had almost said!--who\r\ncould leave you at the moment when you first opened your eyes on him? I\r\nsaw Eustace alone in the next room while the doctor was in attendance\r\non you. I tried to shake his obstinate distrust of your belief in his\r\ninnocence and of my belief in his innocence by every argument and every\r\nappeal that an old friend could address to him. He had but one answer to\r\ngive me. Reason as I might, and plead as I might, he still persisted in\r\nreferring me to the Scotch Verdict."\r\n\r\n"The Scotch Verdict?" I repeated. "What is that?"\r\n\r\nThe Major looked surprised at the question.\r\n\r\n"Have you really never heard of the Trial?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"I thought it strange," he went on, "when you told me you had found out\r\nyour husband\'s true name, that the discovery appeared to have suggested\r\nno painful association to your mind. It is not more than three years\r\nsince all England was talking of your husband. One can hardly wonder at\r\nhis taking refuge, poor fellow, in an assumed name. Where could you have\r\nbeen at the time?"\r\n\r\n"Did you say it was three years ago?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I think I can explain my strange ignorance of what was so well known to\r\nevery one else. Three years since my father was alive. I was living with\r\nhim in a country-house in Italy--up in the mountains, near Sienna. We\r\nnever saw an English newspaper or met with an English traveler for weeks\r\nand weeks together. It is just possible that there might have been some\r\nreference made to the Trial in my father\'s letters from England. If\r\nthere were, he never told me of it. Or, if he did mention the case, I\r\nfelt no interest in it, and forgot it again directly. Tell me--what has\r\nthe Verdict to do with my husband\'s horrible doubt of us? Eustace is a\r\nfree man. The Verdict was Not Guilty, of course?"\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n"Eustace was tried in Scotland," he said. "There is a verdict allowed by\r\nthe Scotch law, which (so far as I know) is not permitted by the laws of\r\nany other civilized country on the face of the earth. When the jury are\r\nin doubt whether to condemn or acquit the prisoner brought before them,\r\nthey are permitted, in Scotland, to express that doubt by a form of\r\ncompromise. If there is not evidence enough, on the one hand, to justify\r\nthem in finding a prisoner guilty, and not evidence enough, on the other\r\nhand, to thoroughly convince them that a prisoner is innocent, they\r\nextricate themselves from the difficulty by finding a verdict of Not\r\nProven."\r\n\r\n"Was that the Verdict when Eustace was tried?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"The jury were not quite satisfied that my husband was guilty? and not\r\nquite satisfied that my husband was innocent? Is that what the Scotch\r\nVerdict means?"\r\n\r\n"That is what the Scotch Verdict means. For three years that doubt about\r\nhim in the minds of the jury who tried him has stood on public record."\r\n\r\nOh, my poor darling! my innocent martyr! I understood it at last. The\r\nfalse name in which he had married me; the terrible words he had spoken\r\nwhen he had warned me to respect his secret; the still more terrible\r\ndoubt that he felt of me at that moment--it was all intelligible to my\r\nsympathies, it was all clear to my understanding, now. I got up again\r\nfrom the sofa, strong in a daring resolution which the Scotch Verdict\r\nhad suddenly kindled in me--a resolution at once too sacred and too\r\ndesperate to be confided, in the first instance, to any other than my\r\nhusband\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"Take me to Eustace!" I cried. "I am strong enough to bear anything\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nAfter one searching look at me, the Major silently offered me his arm,\r\nand led me out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. THE SCOTCH VERDICT.\r\n\r\nWe walked to the far end of the hall. Major Fitz-David opened the\r\ndoor of a long, narrow room built out at the back of the house as a\r\nsmoking-room, and extending along one side of the courtyard as far as\r\nthe stable wall.\r\n\r\nMy husband was alone in the room, seated at the further end of it, near\r\nthe fire-place. He started to his feet and faced me in silence as I\r\nentered. The Major softly closed the door on us and retired. Eustace\r\nnever stirred a step to meet me. I ran to him, and threw my arms round\r\nhis neck and kissed him. The embrace was not returned; the kiss was not\r\nreturned. He passively submitted--nothing more.\r\n\r\n"Eustace!" I said, "I never loved you more dearly than I love you at\r\nthis moment! I never felt for you as I feel for you now!"\r\n\r\nHe released himself deliberately from my arms. He signed to me with the\r\nmechanical courtesy of a stranger to take a chair.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Valeria," he answered, in cold, measured tones. "You could\r\nsay no less to me, after what has happened; and you could say no more.\r\nThank you."\r\n\r\nWe were standing before the fire-place. He left me, and walked away\r\nslowly with his head down, apparently intending to leave the room.\r\n\r\nI followed him--I got before him--I placed myself between him and the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Why do you leave me?" I said. "Why do you speak to me in this cruel\r\nway? Are you angry, Eustace? My darling, if you _are_ angry, I ask you\r\nto forgive me."\r\n\r\n"It is I who ought to ask _your_ pardon," he replied. "I beg you to\r\nforgive me, Valeria, for having made you my wife."\r\n\r\nHe pronounced those words with a hopeless, heart-broken humility\r\ndreadful to see. I laid my hand on his bosom. I said, "Eustace, look at\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHe slowly lifted his eyes to my face--eyes cold and clear and\r\ntearless--looking at me in steady resignation, in immovable despair. In\r\nthe utter wretchedness of that moment, I was like him; I was as quiet\r\nand as cold as my husband. He chilled, he froze me.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible," I said, "that you doubt my belief in your innocence?"\r\n\r\nHe left the question unanswered. He sighed bitterly to himself. "Poor\r\nwoman!" he said, as a stranger might have said, pitying me. "Poor\r\nwoman!"\r\n\r\nMy heart swelled in me as if it would burst. I lifted my hand from his\r\nbosom, and laid it on his shoulder to support myself.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask you to pity me, Eustace; I ask you to do me justice. You\r\nare not doing me justice. If you had trusted me with the truth in the\r\ndays when we first knew that we loved each other--if you had told me\r\nall, and more than all that I know now--as God is my witness I would\r\nstill have married you! _Now_ do you doubt that I believe you are an\r\ninnocent man!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt it," he said. "All your impulses are generous, Valeria.\r\nYou are speaking generously and feeling generously. Don\'t blame me,\r\nmy poor child, if I look on further than you do: if I see what is to\r\ncome--too surely to come--in the cruel future."\r\n\r\n"The cruel future!" I repeated. "What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"You believe in my innocence, Valeria. The jury who tried me doubted\r\nit--and have left that doubt on record. What reason have _you_ for\r\nbelieving, in the face of the Verdict, that I am an innocent man?"\r\n\r\n"I want no reason! I believe in spite of the jury--in spite of the\r\nVerdict."\r\n\r\n"Will your friends agree with you? When your uncle and aunt know what\r\nhas happened--and sooner or later they must know it--what will they say?\r\nThey will say, \'He began badly; he concealed from our niece that he had\r\nbeen wedded to a first wife; he married our niece under a false name.\r\nHe may say he is innocent; but we have only his word for it. When he was\r\nput on his Trial, the Verdict was Not Proven. Not Proven won\'t do for\r\nus. If the jury have done him an injustice--if he _is_ innocent--let him\r\nprove it.\' That is what the world thinks and says of me. That is what\r\nyour friends will think and say of me. The time is coming, Valeria, when\r\nyou--even You--will feel that your friends have reason to appeal to on\r\ntheir side, and that you have no reason on yours."\r\n\r\n"That time will never come!" I answered, warmly. "You wrong me, you\r\ninsult me, in thinking it possible!"\r\n\r\nHe put down my hand from him, and drew back a step, with a bitter smile.\r\n\r\n"We have only been married a few days, Valeria. Your love for me is new\r\nand young. Time, which wears away all things, will wear away the first\r\nfervor of that love."\r\n\r\n"Never! never!"\r\n\r\nHe drew back from me a little further still.\r\n\r\n"Look at the world around you," he said. "The happiest husbands and\r\nwives have their occasional misunderstandings and disagreements; the\r\nbrightest married life has its passing clouds. When those days come for\r\n_us,_ the doubts and fears that you don\'t feel now will find their way\r\nto you then. When the clouds rise in _our_ married life--when I say my\r\nfirst harsh word, when you make your first hasty reply--then, in the\r\nsolitude of your own room, in the stillness of the wakeful night, you\r\nwill think of my first wife\'s miserable death. You will remember that I\r\nwas held responsible for it, and that my innocence was never proved. You\r\nwill say to yourself, \'Did it begin, in _her_ time, with a harsh word\r\nfrom him and with a hasty reply from her? Will it one day end with me\r\nas the jury half feared that it ended with her?\' Hideous questions for\r\na wife to ask herself! You will stifle them; you will recoil from them,\r\nlike a good woman, with horror. But when we meet the next morning you\r\nwill be on your guard, and I shall see it, and know in my heart of\r\nhearts what it means. Imbittered by that knowledge, my next harsh word\r\nmay be harsher still. Your next thoughts of me may remind you more\r\nvividly and more boldly that your husband was once tried as a poisoner,\r\nand that the question of his first wife\'s death was never properly\r\ncleared up. Do you see what materials for a domestic hell are mingling\r\nfor us here? Was it for nothing that I warned you, solemnly warned you,\r\nto draw back, when I found you bent on discovering the truth? Can I ever\r\nbe at your bedside now, when you are ill, and not remind you, in the\r\nmost innocent things I do, of what happened at that other bedside, in\r\nthe time of that other woman whom I married first? If I pour out your\r\nmedicine, I commit a suspicious action--they say I poisoned _her_ in\r\nher medicine. If I bring you a cup of tea, I revive the remembrance of a\r\nhorrid doubt--they said I put the arsenic in _her_ cup of tea. If I kiss\r\nyou when I leave the room, I remind you that the prosecution accused\r\nme of kissing _her,_ to save appearances and produce an effect on the\r\nnurse. Can we live together on such terms as these? No mortal creatures\r\ncould support the misery of it. This very day I said to you, \'If you\r\nstir a step further in this matter, there is an end of your happiness\r\nfor the rest of your life.\' You have taken that step and the end has\r\ncome to your happiness and to mine. The blight that cankers and kills is\r\non you and on me for the rest of our lives!"\r\n\r\nSo far I had forced myself to listen to him. At those last words the\r\npicture of the future that he was placing before me became too hideous\r\nto be endured. I refused to hear more.\r\n\r\n"You are talking horribly," I said. "At your age and at mine, have we\r\ndone with love and done with hope? It is blasphemy to Love and Hope to\r\nsay it!"\r\n\r\n"Wait till you have read the Trial," he answered. "You mean to read it,\r\nI suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Every word of it! With a motive, Eustace, which you have yet to know."\r\n\r\n"No motive of yours, Valeria, no love and hope of yours, can alter the\r\ninexorable facts. My first wife died poisoned; and the verdict of the\r\njury has not absolutely acquitted me of the guilt of causing her death.\r\nAs long as you were ignorant of that the possibilities of happiness were\r\nalways within our reach. Now you know it, I say again--our married life\r\nis at an end."\r\n\r\n"No," I said. "Now I know it, our married life has begun--begun with a\r\nnew object for your wife\'s devotion, with a new reason for your wife\'s\r\nlove!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\nI went near to him again, and took his hand.\r\n\r\n"What did you tell me the world has said of you?" I asked. "What did you\r\ntell me my friends would say of you? \'Not Proven won\'t do for us. If the\r\njury have done him an injustice--if he _is_ innocent--let him prove it.\'\r\nThose were the words you put into the mouths of my friends. I adopt them\r\nfor mine! I say Not Proven won\'t do for _me._ Prove your right, Eustace,\r\nto a verdict of Not Guilty. Why have you let three years pass without\r\ndoing it? Shall I guess why? You have waited for your wife to help you.\r\nHere she is, my darling, ready to help you with all her heart and soul.\r\nHere she is, with one object in life--to show the world and to show the\r\nScotch Jury that her husband is an innocent man!"\r\n\r\nI had roused myself; my pulses were throbbing, my voice rang through the\r\nroom. Had I roused _him_? What was his answer?\r\n\r\n"Read the Trial." That was his answer.\r\n\r\nI seized him by the arm. In my indignation and my despair I shook him\r\nwith all my strength. God forgive me, I could almost have struck him for\r\nthe tone in which he had spoken and the look that he had cast on me!\r\n\r\n"I have told you that I mean to read the Trial," I said. "I mean to\r\nread it, line by line, with you. Some inexcusable mistake has been made.\r\nEvidence in your favor that might have been found has not been found.\r\nSuspicious circumstances have not been investigated. Crafty people have\r\nnot been watched. Eustace! the conviction of some dreadful oversight,\r\ncommitted by you or by the persons who helped you, is firmly settled\r\nin my mind. The resolution to set that vile Verdict right was the first\r\nresolution that came to me when I first heard of it in the next room. We\r\n_will_ set it right! We _must_ set it right--for your sake, for my sake,\r\nfor the sake of our children if we are blessed with children. Oh, my own\r\nlove, don\'t look at me with those cold eyes! Don\'t answer me in those\r\nhard tones! Don\'t treat me as if I were talking ignorantly and madly of\r\nsomething that can never be!"\r\n\r\nStill I never roused him. His next words were spoken compassionately\r\nrather than coldly--that was all.\r\n\r\n"My defense was undertaken by the greatest lawyers in the land," he\r\nsaid. "After such men have done their utmost, and have failed--my poor\r\nValeria, what can you, what can I, do? We can only submit."\r\n\r\n"Never!" I cried. "The greatest lawyers are mortal men; the greatest\r\nlawyers have made mistakes before now. You can\'t deny that."\r\n\r\n"Read the Trial." For the third time he said those cruel words, and said\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nIn utter despair of moving him---feeling keenly, bitterly (if I must\r\nown it), his merciless superiority to all that I had said to him in the\r\nhonest fervor of my devotion and my love--I thought of Major Fitz-David\r\nas a last resort. In the dis ordered state of my mind at that moment, it\r\nmade no difference to me that the Major had already tried to reason with\r\nhim, and had failed. In the face of the facts I had a blind belief\r\nin the influence of his old friend, if his old friend could only be\r\nprevailed upon to support my view.\r\n\r\n"Wait for me one moment," I said. "I want you to hear another opinion\r\nbesides mine."\r\n\r\nI left him, and returned to the study. Major Fitz-David was not there. I\r\nknocked at the door of communication with the front room. It was opened\r\ninstantly by the Major himself. The doctor had gone away. Benjamin still\r\nremained in the room.\r\n\r\n"Will you come and speak to Eustace?" I began. "If you will only say\r\nwhat I want you to say--"\r\n\r\nBefore I could add a word more I heard the house door opened and closed.\r\nMajor Fitz-David and Benjamin heard it too. They looked at each other in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nI ran back, before the Major could stop me, to the room in which I had\r\nseen Eustace. It was empty. My husband had left the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE MAN\'S DECISION.\r\n\r\nMY first impulse was the reckless impulse to follow Eustace--openly\r\nthrough the streets.\r\n\r\nThe Major and Benjamin both opposed this hasty resolution on my part.\r\nThey appealed to my own sense of self-respect, without (so far as I\r\nremember it) producing the slightest effect on my mind. They were more\r\nsuccessful when they entreated me next to be patient for my husband\'s\r\nsake. In mercy to Eustace, they begged me to wait half an hour. If he\r\nfailed to return in that time, they pledged themselves to accompany me\r\nin search of him to the hotel.\r\n\r\nIn mercy to Eustace I consented to wait. What I suffered under the\r\nforced necessity for remaining passive at that crisis in my life no\r\nwords of mine can tell. It will be better if I go on with my narrative.\r\n\r\nBenjamin was the first to ask me what had passed between my husband and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n"You may speak freely, my dear," he said. "I know what has happened\r\nsince you have been in Major Fitz-David\'s house. No one has told me\r\nabout it; I found it out for myself. If you remember, I was struck by\r\nthe name of \'Macallan,\' when you first mentioned it to me at my cottage.\r\nI couldn\'t guess why at the time. I know why now."\r\n\r\nHearing this, I told them both unreservedly what I had said to Eustace,\r\nand how he had received it. To my unspeakable disappointment, they both\r\nsided with my husband, treating my view of his position as a mere dream.\r\nThey said it, as he had said it, "You have not read the Trial."\r\n\r\nI was really enraged with them. "The facts are enough for _me,_" I said.\r\n"We know he is innocent. Why is his innocence not proved? It ought to\r\nbe, it must be, it shall be! If the Trial tell me it can\'t be done, I\r\nrefuse to believe the Trial. Where is the book, Major? Let me see for\r\nmyself if his lawyers have left nothing for his wife to do. Did they\r\nlove him as I love him? Give me the book!"\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David looked at Benjamin.\r\n\r\n"It will only additionally shock and distress her if I give her the\r\nbook," he said. "Don\'t you agree with me?"\r\n\r\nI interposed before Benjamin could answer.\r\n\r\n"If you refuse my request," I said, "you will oblige me, Major, to go\r\nto the nearest bookseller and tell him to buy the Trial for me. I am\r\ndetermined to read it."\r\n\r\nThis time Benjamin sided with me.\r\n\r\n"Nothing can make matters worse than they are, sir," he said. "If I may\r\nbe permitted to advise, let her have her own way."\r\n\r\nThe Major rose and took the book out of the Italian cabinet, to which he\r\nhad consigned it for safe-keeping.\r\n\r\n"My young friend tells me that she informed you of her regrettable\r\noutbreak of temper a few days since," he said as he handed me the\r\nvolume. "I was not aware at the time what book she had in her hand when\r\nshe so far forgot herself as to destroy the vase. When I left you in the\r\nstudy, I supposed the Report of the Trial to be in its customary place\r\non the top shelf of the book-case, and I own I felt some curiosity\r\nto know whether you would think of examining that shelf. The broken\r\nvase--it is needless to conceal it from you now--was one of a pair\r\npresented to me by your husband and his first wife only a week before\r\nthe poor woman\'s terrible death. I felt my first presentiment that\r\nyou were on the brink of discovery when I found you looking at the\r\nfragments, and I fancy I betrayed to you that something of the sort was\r\ndisturbing me. You looked as if you noticed it."\r\n\r\n"I did notice it, Major. And I too had a vague idea that I was on the\r\nway to discovery. Will you look at your watch? Have we waited half an\r\nhour yet?"\r\n\r\nMy impatience had misled me. The ordeal of the half-hour was not yet at\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nSlowly and more slowly the heavy minutes followed each other, and still\r\nthere were no signs of my husband\'s return. We tried to continue\r\nour conversation, and failed. Nothing was audible; no sounds but the\r\nordinary sounds of the street disturbed the dreadful silence. Try as I\r\nmight to repel it, there was one foreboding thought that pressed closer\r\nand closer on my mind as the interval of waiting wore its weary way on.\r\nI shuddered as I asked myself if our married life had come to an end--if\r\nEustace had really left me.\r\n\r\nThe Major saw what Benjamin\'s slower perception had not yet\r\ndiscovered--that my fortitude was beginning to sink under the unrelieved\r\noppression of suspense.\r\n\r\n"Come!" he said. "Let us go to the hotel."\r\n\r\nIt then wanted nearly five minutes to the half-hour. I _looked_ my\r\ngratitude to Major Fitz-David for sparing me those last minutes: I could\r\nnot speak to him or to Benjamin. In silence we three got into a cab and\r\ndrove to the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe landlady met us in the hall. Nothing had been seen or heard of\r\nEustace. There was a letter waiting for me upstairs on the table in our\r\nsitting-room. It had been left at the hotel by a messenger only a few\r\nminutes since.\r\n\r\nTrembling and breathless, I ran up the stairs, the two gentlemen\r\nfollowing me. The address of the letter was in my husband\'s handwriting.\r\nMy heart sank in me as I looked at the lines; there could be but one\r\nreason for his writing to me. That closed envelope held his farewell\r\nwords. I sat with the letter on my lap, stupefied, incapable of opening\r\nit.\r\n\r\nKind-hearted Benjamin attempted to comfort and encourage me. The Major,\r\nwith his larger experience of women, warned the old man to be silent.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" I heard him whisper. "Speaking to her will do no good now. Give\r\nher time."\r\n\r\nActing on a sudden impulse, I held out the letter to him as he spoke.\r\nEven moments might be of importance, if Eustace had indeed left me. To\r\ngive me time might be to lose the opportunity of recalling him.\r\n\r\n"You are his old friend," I said. "Open his letter, Major, and read it\r\nfor me."\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David opened the letter and read it through to himself. When\r\nhe had done he threw it on the table with a gesture which was almost a\r\ngesture of contempt.\r\n\r\n"There is but one excuse for him," he said. "The man is mad."\r\n\r\nThose words told me all. I knew the worst; and, knowing it, I could read\r\nthe letter. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n"MY BELOVED VALERIA--When you read these lines you read my farewell\r\nwords. I return to my solitary unfriended life--my life before I knew\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n"My darling, you have been cruelly treated. You have been entrapped\r\ninto marrying a man who has been publicly accused of poisoning his first\r\nwife--and who has not been honorably and completely acquitted of the\r\ncharge. And you know it!\r\n\r\n"Can you live on terms of mutual confidence and mutual esteem with me\r\nwhen I have committed this fraud, and when I stand toward you in this\r\nposition? It was possible for you to live with me happily while you were\r\nin ignorance of the truth. It is _not_ possible, now you know all.\r\n\r\n"No! the one atonement I can make is--to leave you. Your one chance of\r\nfuture happiness is to be disassociated, at once and forever, from my\r\ndishonored life. I love you, Valeria--truly, devotedly, passionately.\r\nBut the specter of the poisoned woman rises between us. It makes no\r\ndifference that I am innocent even of the thought of harming my first\r\nwife. My innocence has not been proved. In this world my innocence can\r\nnever be proved. You are young and loving, and generous and hopeful.\r\nBless others, Valeria, with your rare attractions and your delightful\r\ngifts. They are of no avail with _me._ The poisoned woman stands between\r\nus. If you live with me now, you will see her as I see her. _That_\r\ntorture shall never be yours. I love you. I leave you.\r\n\r\n"Do you think me hard and cruel? Wait a little, and time will change\r\nthat way of thinking. As the years go on you will say to yourself,\r\n\'Basely as he deceived me, there was some generosity in him. He was man\r\nenough to release me of his own free will.\'\r\n\r\n"Yes, Valeria, I fully, freely release you. If it be possible to annul\r\nour marriage, let it be done. Recover your liberty by any means that\r\nyou may be advised to employ; and be assured beforehand of my entire and\r\nimplicit submission. My lawyers have the necessary instructions on this\r\nsubject. Your uncle has only to communicate with them, and I think he\r\nwill be satisfied of my resolution to do you justice. The one interest\r\nthat I have now left in life is my interest in your welfare and your\r\nhappiness in the time to come. Your welfare and your happiness are no\r\nlonger to be found in your union with Me.\r\n\r\n"I can write no more. This letter will wait for you at the hotel. It\r\nwill be useless to attempt to trace me. I know my own weakness. My heart\r\nis all yours: I might yield to you if I let you see me again.\r\n\r\n"Show these lines to your uncle, and to any friends whose opinions you\r\nmay value. I have only to sign my dishonored name, and every one\r\nwill understand and applaud my motive for writing as I do. The name\r\njustifies--amply justifies--the letter. Forgive and forget me. Farewell.\r\n\r\n                              "EUSTACE MACALLAN."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those words he took his leave of me. We had then been married--six\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. THE WOMAN\'S ANSWER.\r\n\r\nTHUS far I have written of myself with perfect frankness, and, I think I\r\nmay fairly add, with some courage as well. My frankness fails me and my\r\ncourage fails me when I look back to my husband\'s farewell letter, and\r\ntry to recall the storm of contending passions that it roused in my\r\nmind. No! I cannot tell the truth about myself--I dare not tell the\r\ntruth about myself--at that terrible time. Men! consult your observation\r\nof women, and imagine what I felt; women! look into your own hearts, and\r\nsee what I felt, for yourselves.\r\n\r\nWhat I _did,_ when my mind was quiet again, is an easier matter to deal\r\nwith. I answered my husband\'s letter. My reply to him shall appear in\r\nthese pages. It will show, in some degree, what effect (of the lasting\r\nsort) his desertion of me produced on my mind. It will also reveal the\r\nmotives that sustained me, the hopes that animated me, in the new and\r\nstrange life which my next chapters must describe.\r\n\r\nI was removed from the hotel in the care of my fatherly old friend,\r\nBenjamin. A bedroom was prepared for me in his little villa. There I\r\npassed the first night of my separation from my husband. Toward the\r\nmorning my weary brain got some rest--I slept.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast-time Major Fitz-David called to inquire about me. He had\r\nkindly volunteered to go and speak for me to my husband\'s lawyers on the\r\npreceding day. They had admitted that they knew where Eustace had gone,\r\nbut they declared at the same time that they were positively forbidden\r\nto communicate his address to any one. In other respects their\r\n"instructions" in relation to the wife of their client were (as they\r\nwere pleased to express it) "generous to a fault." I had only to write\r\nto them, and they would furnish me with a copy by return of post.\r\n\r\nThis was the Major\'s news. He refrained, with the tact that\r\ndistinguished him, from putting any questions to me beyond questions\r\nrelating to the state of my health. These answered, he took his leave of\r\nme for that day. He and Benjamin had a long talk together afterward in\r\nthe garden of the villa.\r\n\r\nI retired to my room and wrote to my uncle Starkweather, telling him\r\nexactly what had happened, and inclosing him a copy of my husband\'s\r\nletter. This done, I went out for a little while to breathe the fresh\r\nair and to think. I was soon weary, and went back again to my room to\r\nrest. My kind old Benjamin left me at perfect liberty to be alone as\r\nlong as I pleased. Toward the afternoon I began to feel a little more\r\nlike my old self again. I mean by this that I could think of Eustace\r\nwithout bursting out crying, and could speak to Benjamin without\r\ndistressing and frightening the dear old man.\r\n\r\nThat night I had a little more sleep. The next morning I was strong\r\nenough to confront the first and foremost duty that I now owed to\r\nmyself--the duty of answering my husband\'s letter.\r\n\r\nI wrote to him in these words:\r\n\r\n"I am still too weak and weary, Eustace, to write to you at any length.\r\nBut my mind is clear. I have formed my own opinion of you and your\r\nletter; and I know what I mean to do now you have left me. Some women,\r\nin my situation, might think that you had forfeited all right to their\r\nconfidence. I don\'t think that. So I write and tell you what is in my\r\nmind in the plainest and fewest words that I can use.\r\n\r\n"You say you love me--and you leave me. I don\'t understand loving a\r\nwoman and leaving her. For my part, in spite of the hard things you have\r\nsaid and written to me, and in spite of the cruel manner in which you\r\nhave left me, I love you--and I won\'t give you up. No! As long as I live\r\nI mean to live your wife.\r\n\r\n"Does this surprise you? It surprises _me._ If another woman wrote\r\nin this manner to a man who had behaved to her as you have behaved, I\r\nshould be quite at a loss to account for her conduct. I am quite at a\r\nloss to account for my own conduct. I ought to hate you, and yet I can\'t\r\nhelp loving you. I am ashamed of myself; but so it is.\r\n\r\n"You need feel no fear of my attempting to find out where you are, and\r\nof my trying to persuade you to return to me. I am not quite foolish\r\nenough to do that. You are not in a fit state of mind to return to\r\nme. You are all wrong, all over, from head to foot. When you get right\r\nagain, I am vain enough to think that you will return to me of your\r\nown accord. And shall I be weak enough to forgive you? Yes! I shall\r\ncertainly be weak enough to forgive you.\r\n\r\n"But how are you to get right again?\r\n\r\n"I have puzzled my brains over this question by night and by day, and my\r\nopinion is that you will never get right again unless I help you.\r\n\r\n"How am I to help you?\r\n\r\n"That question is easily answered. What the Law has failed to do for\r\nyou, your Wife must do for you. Do you remember what I said when we were\r\ntogether in the back room at Major Fitz-David\'s house? I told you that\r\nthe first thought that came to me, when I heard what the Scotch jury had\r\ndone, was the thought of setting their vile Verdict right. Well! Your\r\nletter has fixed this idea more firmly in my mind than ever. The only\r\nchance that I can see of winning you back to me, in the character of a\r\npenitent and loving husband, is to change that underhand Scotch Verdict\r\nof Not Proven into an honest English Verdict of Not Guilty.\r\n\r\n"Are you surprised at the knowledge of the law which this way of writing\r\nbetrays in an ignorant woman? I have been learning, my dear: the Law and\r\nthe Lady have begun by understanding one another. In plain English, I\r\nhave looked into Ogilvie\'s \'Imperial Dictionary,\' and Ogilvie tells\r\nme, \'A verdict of Not Proven only indicates that, in the opinion of the\r\njury, there is a deficiency in the evidence to convict the prisoner. A\r\nverdict of Not Guilty imports the jury\'s opinion that the prisoner is\r\ninnocent.\' Eustace, that shall be the opinion of the world in general,\r\nand of the Scotch jury in particular, in your case. To that one object I\r\ndedicate my life to come, if God spare me!\r\n\r\n"Who will help me, when I need help, is more than I yet know. There was\r\na time when I had hoped that we should go hand in hand together in doing\r\nthis good work. That hope is at an end. I no longer expect you, or\r\nask you, to help me. A man who thinks as you think can give no help to\r\nanybody--it is his miserable condition to have no hope. So be it! I will\r\nhope for two, and will work for two; and I shall find some one to help\r\nme--never fear--if I deserve it.\r\n\r\n"I will say nothing about my plans--I have not read the Trial yet. It\r\nis quite enough for me that I know you are innocent. When a man is\r\ninnocent, there _must_ be a way of proving it: the one thing needful is\r\nto find the way. Sooner or later, with or without assistance, I shall\r\nfind it. Yes! before I know any single particular of the Case, I tell\r\nyou positively--I shall find it!\r\n\r\n"You may laugh over this blind confidence on my part, or you may cry\r\nover it. I don\'t pretend to know whether I am an object for ridicule or\r\nan object for pity. Of one thing only I am certain: I mean to win\r\nyou back, a man vindicated before the world, without a stain on his\r\ncharacter or his name--thanks to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Write to me, sometimes, Eustace; and believe me, through all the\r\nbitterness of this bitter business, your faithful and loving\r\n\r\n"VALERIA."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was my reply! Poor enough as a composition (I could write a much\r\nbetter letter now), it had, if I may presume to say so, one merit. It\r\nwas the honest expression of what I really meant and felt.\r\n\r\nI read it to Benjamin. He held up his hands with his customary gesture\r\nwhen he was thoroughly bewildered and dismayed. "It seems the rashest\r\nletter that ever was written," said the dear old man. "I never heard,\r\nValeria, of a woman doing what you propose to do. Lord help us! the new\r\ngeneration is beyond my fathoming. I wish your uncle Starkweather was\r\nhere: I wonder what he would say? Oh, dear me, what a letter from a wife\r\nto a husband! Do you really mean to send it to him?"\r\n\r\nI added immeasurably to my old friend\'s surprise by not even employing\r\nthe post-office. I wished to see the "instructions" which my husband had\r\nleft behind him. So I took the letter to his lawyers myself.\r\n\r\nThe firm consisted of two partners. They both received me together. One\r\nwas a soft, lean man, with a sour smile. The other was a hard, fat man,\r\nwith ill-tempered eyebrows. I took a great dislike to both of them. On\r\ntheir side, they appeared to feel a strong distrust of me. We began\r\nby disagreeing. They showed me my husband\'s "instructions," providing,\r\namong other things, for the payment of one clear half of his income as\r\nlong as he lived to his wife. I positively refused to touch a farthing\r\nof his money.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers were unaffectedly shocked and astonished at this decision.\r\nNothing of the sort had ever happened before in the whole course of\r\ntheir experience. They argued and remonstrated with me. The partner\r\nwith the ill-tempered eyebrows wanted to know what my reasons were. The\r\npartner with the sour smile reminded his colleague satirically that I\r\nwas a lady, and had therefore no reasons to give. I only answered, "Be\r\nso good as to forward my letter, gentlemen," and left them.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to claim any credit to myself in these pages which I do\r\nnot honestly deserve. The truth is that my pride forbade me to accept\r\nhelp from Eustace, now that he had left me. My own little fortune (eight\r\nhundred a year) had been settled on myself when I married. It had been\r\nmore than I wanted as a single woman, and I was resolved that it should\r\nbe enough for me now. Benjamin had insisted on my considering his\r\ncottage as my home. Under these circumstances, the expenses in which my\r\ndetermination to clear my husband\'s character might involve me were\r\nthe only expenses for which I had to provide. I could afford to be\r\nindependent, and independent I resolved that I would be.\r\n\r\nWhile I am occupied in confessing my weakness and my errors, it is\r\nonly right to add that, dearly as I still loved my unhappy, misguided\r\nhusband, there was one little fault of his which I found it not easy to\r\nforgive.\r\n\r\nPardoning other things, I could not quite pardon his concealing from me\r\nthat he had been married to a first wife. Why I should have felt this\r\nso bitterly as I did, at certain times and seasons, I am not able to\r\nexplain. Jealousy was at the bottom of it, I suppose. And yet I was\r\nnot conscious of being jealous--especially when I thought of the poor\r\ncreature\'s miserable death. Still, Eustace ought not to have kept _that_\r\nsecret from me, I used to think to myself, at odd times when I was\r\ndiscouraged and out of temper. What would _he_ have said if I had been a\r\nwidow, and had never told him of it?\r\n\r\nIt was getting on toward evening when I returned to the cottage.\r\nBenjamin appeared to have been on the lookout for me. Before I could\r\nring at the bell he opened the garden gate.\r\n\r\n"Prepare yourself for a surprise, my dear," he said. "Your uncle, the\r\nReverend Doctor Starkweather, has arrived from the North, and is waiting\r\nto see you. He received your letter this morning, and he took the first\r\ntrain to London as soon as he had read it."\r\n\r\nIn another minute my uncle\'s strong arms were round me. In my forlorn\r\nposition, I felt the good vicar\'s kindness, in traveling all the way\r\nto London to see me, very gratefully. It brought the tears into my\r\neyes--tears, without bitterness, that did me good.\r\n\r\n"I have come, my dear child, to take you back to your old home," he\r\nsaid. "No words can tell how fervently I wish you had never left your\r\naunt and me. Well! well! we won\'t talk about it. The mischief is done,\r\nand the next thing is to mend it as well as we can. If I could only get\r\nwithin arm\'s-length of that husband of yours, Valeria--There! there! God\r\nforgive me, I am forgetting that I am a clergyman. What shall I forget\r\nnext, I wonder? By-the-by, your aunt sends you her dearest love. She is\r\nmore superstitious than ever. This miserable business doesn\'t surprise\r\nher a bit. She says it all began with your making that mistake about\r\nyour name in signing the church register. You remember? Was there ever\r\nsuch stuff? Ah, she\'s a foolish woman, that wife of mine! But she means\r\nwell--a good soul at bottom. She would have traveled all the way here\r\nalong with me if I would have let her. I said, \'No; you stop at home,\r\nand look after the house and the parish, and I\'ll bring the child back.\'\r\nYou shall have your old bedroom, Valeria, with the white curtains, you\r\nknow, looped up with blue! We will return to the Vicarage (if you can\r\nget up in time) by the nine-forty train to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nReturn to the Vicarage! How could I do that? How could I hope to gain\r\nwhat was now the one object of my existence if I buried myself in\r\na remote north-country village? It was simply impossible for me to\r\naccompany Doctor Starkweather on his return to his own house.\r\n\r\n"I thank you, uncle, with all my heart," I said. "But I am afraid I\r\ncan\'t leave London for the present."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t leave London for the present?" he repeated. "What does the\r\ngirl mean, Mr. Benjamin?" Benjamin evaded a direct reply.\r\n\r\n"She is kindly welcome here, Doctor Starkweather," he said, "as long as\r\nshe chooses to stay with me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s no answer," retorted my uncle, in his rough-and-ready way. He\r\nturned to me. "What is there to keep you in London?" he asked. "You used\r\nto hate London. I suppose there is some reason?"\r\n\r\nIt was only due to my good guardian and friend that I should take him\r\ninto my confidence sooner or later. There was no help for it but to\r\nrouse my courage, and tell him frankly what I had it in my mind to do.\r\nThe vicar listened in breathless dismay. He turned to Benjamin, with\r\ndistress as well as surprise in his face, when I had done.\r\n\r\n"God help her!" cried the worthy man. "The poor thing\'s troubles have\r\nturned her brain!"\r\n\r\n"I thought you would disapprove of it, sir," said Benjamin, in his mild\r\nand moderate way. "I confess I disapprove of it myself."\r\n\r\n"\'Disapprove of it\' isn\'t the word," retorted the vicar. "Don\'t put it\r\nin that feeble way, if you please. An act of madness--that\'s what it is,\r\nif she really mean what she says." He turned my way, and looked as\r\nhe used to look at the afternoon service when he was catechising an\r\nobstinate child. "You don\'t mean it," he said, "do you?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to forfeit your good opinion, uncle," I replied. "But I must\r\nown that I do certainly mean it."\r\n\r\n"In plain English," retorted the vicar, "you are conceited enough to\r\nthink that you can succeed where the greatest lawyers in Scotland\r\nhave failed. _They_ couldn\'t prove this man\'s innocence, all working\r\ntogether. And _you_ are going to prove it single-handed? Upon my word,\r\nyou are a wonderful woman," cried my uncle, suddenly descending from\r\nindignation to irony. "May a plain country parson, who isn\'t used to\r\nlawyers in petticoats, be permitted to ask how you mean to do it?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to begin by reading the Trial, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Nice reading for a young woman! You will be wanting a batch of nasty\r\nFrench novels next. Well, and when you have read the Trial--what then?\r\nHave you thought of that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, uncle; I have thought of that. I shall first try to form some\r\nconclusion (after reading the Trial) as to the guilty person who really\r\ncommitted the crime. Then I shall make out a list of the witnesses who\r\nspoke in my husband\'s defense. I shall go to those witnesses, and tell\r\nthem who I am and what I want. I shall ask all sorts of questions which\r\ngrave lawyers might think it beneath their dignity to put. I shall be\r\nguided, in what I do next, by the answers I receive. And I shall not be\r\ndiscouraged, no matter what difficulties are thrown in my way. Those are\r\nmy plans, uncle, so far as I know them now."\r\n\r\nThe vicar and Benjamin looked at each other as if they doubted the\r\nevidence of their own senses. The vicar spoke.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me," he said, "that you are going roaming about\r\nthe country to throw yourself on the mercy of strangers, and to risk\r\nwhatever rough reception you may get in the course of your travels? You!\r\nA young woman! Deserted by your husband! With nobody to protect you! Mr.\r\nBenjamin, do you hear her? And can you believe your ears? I declare to\r\nHeaven _I_ don\'t know whether I am awake or dreaming. Look at her--just\r\nlook at her! There she sits as cool and easy as if she had said nothing\r\nat all extraordinary, and was going to do nothing out of the common way!\r\nWhat am I to do with her?--that\'s the serious question--what on earth am\r\nI to do with her?"\r\n\r\n"Let me try my experiment, uncle, rash as it may look to you," I said.\r\n"Nothing else will comfort and support me; and God knows I want comfort\r\nand support. Don\'t think me obstinate. I am ready to admit that there\r\nare serious difficulties in my way."\r\n\r\nThe vicar resumed his ironical tone.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he said. "You admit that, do you? Well, there is something gained,\r\nat any rate."\r\n\r\n"Many another woman before me," I went on, "has faced serious\r\ndifficulties, and has conquered them--for the sake of the man she\r\nloved."\r\n\r\nDoctor Starkweather rose slowly to his feet, with the air of a person\r\nwhose capacity of toleration had reached its last limits.\r\n\r\n"Am I to understand that you are still in love with Mr. Eustace\r\nMacallan?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I answered.\r\n\r\n"The hero of the great Poison Trial?" pursued my uncle. "The man who has\r\ndeceived and deserted you? You love him?"\r\n\r\n"I love him more dearly than ever."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Benjamin," said the vicar, "if she recover her senses between\r\nthis and nine o\'clock to-morrow morning, send her with her luggage to\r\nLoxley\'s Hotel, where I am now staying. Good-night, Valeria. I shall\r\nconsult with your aunt as to what is to be done next. I have no more to\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Give me a kiss, uncle, at parting."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I\'ll give you a kiss. Anything you like, Valeria. I shall be\r\nsixty-five next birthday; and I thought I knew something of women, at\r\nmy time of life. It seems I know nothing. Loxley\'s Hotel is the address,\r\nMr. Benjamin. Good-night."\r\n\r\nBenjamin looked very grave when he returned to me after accompanying\r\nDoctor Starkweather to the garden gate.\r\n\r\n"Pray be advised, my dear," he said. "I don\'t ask you to consider _my_\r\nview of this matter, as good for much. But your uncle\'s opinion is\r\nsurely worth considering?"\r\n\r\nI did not reply. It was useless to say any more. I made up my mind to be\r\nmisunderstood and discouraged, and to bear it. "Good-night, my dear old\r\nfriend," was all I said to Benjamin. Then I turned away--I confess with\r\nthe tears in my eyes--and took refuge in my bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe window-blind was up, and the autumn moonlight shone brilliantly into\r\nthe little room.\r\n\r\nAs I stood by the window, looking out, the memory came to me of another\r\nmoonlight night, when Eustace and I were walking together in the\r\nVicarage garden before our marriage. It was the night of which I have\r\nwritten, many pages back, when there were obstacles to our union, and\r\nwhen Eustace had offered to release me from my engagement to him. I saw\r\nthe dear face again looking at me in the moonlight; I heard once\r\nmore his words and mine. "Forgive me," he had said, "for having loved\r\nyou--passionately, devotedly loved you. Forgive me, and let me go."\r\n\r\nAnd I had answered, "Oh, Eustace, I am only a woman--don\'t madden me!\r\nI can\'t live without you. I must and will be your wife!" And now, after\r\nmarriage had united us, we were parted! Parted, still loving each as\r\npassionately as ever. And why? Because he had been accused of a crime\r\nthat he had never committed, and because a Scotch jury had failed to see\r\nthat he was an innocent man.\r\n\r\nI looked at the lovely moonlight, pursuing these remembrances and these\r\nthoughts. A new ardor burned in me. "No!" I said to myself. "Neither\r\nrelations nor friends shall prevail on me to falter and fail in my\r\nhusband\'s cause. The assertion of his innocence is the work of my life;\r\nI will begin it to-night."\r\n\r\nI drew down the blind and lighted the candles. In the quiet night, alone\r\nand unaided, I took my first step on the toilsome and terrible journey\r\nthat lay before me. From the title-page to the end, without stopping to\r\nrest and without missing a word, I read the Trial of my husband for the\r\nmurder of his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. PARADISE REGAINED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. THE STORY OF THE TRIAL. THE PRELIMINARIES.\r\n\r\nLET me confess another weakness, on my part, before I begin the Story\r\nof the Trial. I cannot prevail upon myself to copy, for the second time,\r\nthe horrible title-page which holds up to public ignominy my husband\'s\r\nname. I have copied it once in my tenth chapter. Let once be enough.\r\n\r\nTurning to the second page of the Trial, I found a Note, assuring the\r\nreader of the absolute correctness of the Report of the Proceedings. The\r\ncompiler described himself as having enjoyed certain special privileges.\r\nThus, the presiding Judge had himself revised his charge to the jury.\r\nAnd, again, the chief lawyers for the prosecution and the defense,\r\nfollowing the Judge\'s example, had revised their speeches for and\r\nagainst the prisoner. Lastly, particular care had been taken to secure a\r\nliterally correct report of the evidence given by the various witnesses.\r\nIt was some relief to me to discover this Note, and to be satisfied at\r\nthe outset that the Story of the Trial was, in every particular, fully\r\nand truly given.\r\n\r\nThe next page interested me more nearly still. It enumerated the actors\r\nin the Judicial Drama--the men who held in their hands my husband\'s\r\nhonor and my husband\'s life. Here is the List:\r\n\r\n     THE LORD JUSTICE CLERK,}\r\n         LORD DRUMFENNICK, }Judges on the Bench.\r\n           LORD NOBLEKIRK, }\r\n\r\n              THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mintlaw), } DONALD DREW, Esquire\r\n     (Advocate-Depute).} Counsel for the Crown.\r\n\r\n     MR. JAMES ARLISS, W. S., Agent for the Crown.\r\n\r\n        THE DEAN OF FACULTY (Farmichael), } Counsel for the Panel\r\n     ALEXANDER CROCKET, Esquire (Advocate),} (otherwise the Prisoner)\r\n\r\n     MR. THORNIEBANK, W. S.,}\r\n      MR. PLAYMORE, W. S., } Agents for the Panel.\r\n\r\nThe Indictment against the prisoner then followed. I shall not copy the\r\nuncouth language, full of needless repetitions (and, if I know anything\r\nof the subject, not guiltless of bad grammar as well), in which my\r\ninnocent husband was solemnly and falsely accused of poisoning his first\r\nwife. The less there is of that false and hateful Indictment on this\r\npage, the better and truer the page will look, to _my_ eyes.\r\n\r\nTo be brief, then, Eustace Macallan was "indicted and accused, at the\r\ninstance of David Mintlaw, Esquire, Her Majesty\'s Advocate, for Her\r\nMajesty\'s interest," of the Murder of his Wife by poison, at his\r\nresidence called Gleninch, in the county of Mid-Lothian. The poison was\r\nalleged to have been wickedly and feloniously given by the prisoner to\r\nhis wife Sara, on two occasions, in the form of arsenic, administered\r\nin tea, medicine, "or other article or articles of food or drink, to the\r\nprosecutor unknown." It was further declared that the prisoner\'s wife\r\nhad died of the poison thus administered b y her husband, on one or\r\nother, or both, of the stated occasions; and that she was thus murdered\r\nby her husband. The next paragraph asserted that the said\r\nEustace Macallan, taken before John Daviot, Esquire, advocate,\r\nSheriff-Substitute of Mid-Lothian, did in his presence at Edinburgh\r\n(on a given date, viz., the 29th of October), subscribe a Declaration\r\nstating his innocence of the alleged crime: this Declaration being\r\nreserved in the Indictment--together with certain documents, papers and\r\narticles, enumerated in an Inventory--to be used in evidence against the\r\nprisoner. The Indictment concluded by declaring that, in the event\r\nof the offense charged against the prisoner being found proven by the\r\nVerdict, he, the said Eustace Macallan, "ought to be punished with the\r\npains of the law, to deter others from committing like crimes in all\r\ntime coming."\r\n\r\nSo much for the Indictment! I have done with it--and I am rejoiced to be\r\ndone with it.\r\n\r\nAn Inventory of papers, documents, and articles followed at great length\r\non the next three pages. This, in its turn, was succeeded by the list\r\nof the witnesses, and by the names of the jurors (fifteen in number)\r\nballoted for to try the case. And then, at last, the Report of the Trial\r\nbegan. It resolved itself, to my mind, into three great Questions. As it\r\nappeared to me at the time, so let me present it here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. FIRST QUESTION--DID THE WOMAN DIE POISONED?\r\n\r\nTHE proceedings began at ten o\'clock. The prisoner was placed at\r\nthe Bar, before the High Court of Justiciary, at Edinburgh. He bowed\r\nrespectfully to the Bench, and pleaded Not Guilty, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nIt was observed by every one present that the prisoner\'s face betrayed\r\ntraces of acute mental suffering. He was deadly pale. His eyes never\r\nonce wandered to the crowd in the Court. When certain witnesses appeared\r\nagainst him, he looked at them with a momentary attention. At other\r\ntimes he kept his eyes on the ground. When the evidence touched on his\r\nwife\'s illness and death, he was deeply affected, and covered his face\r\nwith his hands. It was a subject of general remark and general surprise\r\nthat the prisoner, in this case (although a man), showed far less\r\nself-possession than the last prisoner tried in that Court for murder--a\r\nwoman, who had been convicted on overwhelming evidence. There were\r\npersons present (a small minority only) who considered this want\r\nof composure on the part of the prisoner to be a sign in his favor.\r\nSelf-possession, in his dreadful position, signified, to their minds,\r\nthe stark insensibility of a heartless and shameless criminal, and\r\nafforded in itself a presumption, not of innocence, but of guilt.\r\n\r\nThe first witness called was John Daviot, Esquire, Sheriff-Substitute\r\nof Mid-Lothian. He was examined by the Lord Advocate (as counsel for the\r\nprosecution); and said:\r\n\r\n"The prisoner was brought before me on the present charge. He made\r\nand subscribed a Declaration on the 29th of October. It was freely\r\nand voluntarily made, the prisoner having been first duly warned and\r\nadmonished."\r\n\r\nHaving identified the Declaration, the Sheriff-Substitute--being\r\ncross-examined by the Dean of Faculty (as counsel for the\r\ndefense)--continued his evidence in these words:\r\n\r\n"The charge against the prisoner was Murder. This was communicated\r\nto him before he made the Declaration. The questions addressed to\r\nthe prisoner were put partly by me, partly by another officer, the\r\nprocurator-fiscal. The answers were given distinctly, and, so far as\r\nI could judge, without reserve. The statements put forward in\r\nthe Declaration were all made in answer to questions asked by the\r\nprocurator-fiscal or by myself."\r\n\r\nA clerk in the Sheriff-Clerk\'s office then officially produced the\r\nDeclaration, and corroborated the evidence of the witness who had\r\npreceded him.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the next witness created a marked sensation in the\r\nCourt. This was no less a person than the nurse who had attended Mrs.\r\nMacallan in her last illness--by name Christina Ormsay.\r\n\r\nAfter the first formal answers, the nurse (examined by the Lord\r\nAdvocate) proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n"I was first sent for to attend the deceased lady on the 7th of October.\r\nShe was then suffering from a severe cold, accompanied by a rheumatic\r\naffection of the left knee-joint. Previous to this I understood that\r\nher health had been fairly good. She was not a very difficult person to\r\nnurse when you got used to her, and understood how to manage her. The\r\nmain difficulty was caused by her temper. She was not a sullen person;\r\nshe was headstrong and violent--easily excited to fly into a passion,\r\nand quite reckless in her fits of anger as to what she said or did. At\r\nsuch times I really hardly think she knew what she was about. My own\r\nidea is that her temper was made still more irritable by unhappiness in\r\nher married life. She was far from being a reserved person. Indeed,\r\nshe was disposed (as I thought) to be a little too communicative about\r\nherself and her troubles with persons like me who were beneath her in\r\nstation. She did not scruple, for instance, to tell me (when we had\r\nbeen long enough together to get used to each other) that she was very\r\nunhappy, and fretted a good deal about her husband. One night, when she\r\nwas wakeful and restless, she said to me--"\r\n\r\nThe Dean of Faculty here interposed, speaking on the prisoner\'s behalf.\r\nHe appealed to the Judges to say whether such loose and unreliable\r\nevidence as this was evidence which could be received by the Court.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Advocate (speaking on behalf of the Crown) claimed it as his\r\nright to produce the evidence. It was of the utmost importance in this\r\ncase to show (on the testimony of an unprejudiced witness) on what terms\r\nthe husband and wife were living. The witness was a most respectable\r\nwoman. She had won, and deserved, the confidence of the unhappy lady\r\nwhom she attended on her death-bed.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly consulting together, the Judges unanimously decided that\r\nthe evidence could not be admitted. What the witness had herself seen\r\nand observed of the relations between the husband and wife was the only\r\nevidence that they could receive.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Advocate thereupon continued his examination of the witness.\r\nChristina Ormsay resumed her evidence as follows:\r\n\r\n"My position as nurse led necessarily to my seeing more of Mrs. Macallan\r\nthan any other person in the house. I am able to speak from experience\r\nof many things not known to others who were only in her room at\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n"For instance, I had more than one opportunity of personally observing\r\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Macallan did not live together very happily. I can\r\ngive you an example of this, not drawn from what others told me, but\r\nfrom what I noticed for myself.\r\n\r\n"Toward the latter part of my attendance on Mrs. Macallan, a young widow\r\nlady named Mrs. Beauly--a cousin of Mr. Macallan\'s--came to stay at\r\nGleninch. Mrs. Macallan was jealous of this lady; and she showed it in\r\nmy presence only the day before her death, when Mr. Macallan came into\r\nher room to inquire how she had passed the night. \'Oh,\' she said, \'never\r\nmind how _I_ have slept! What do you care whether I sleep well or ill?\r\nHow has Mrs. Beauly passed the night? Is she more beautiful than ever\r\nthis morning? Go back to her--pray go back to her! Don\'t waste your time\r\nwith me!\' Beginning in that manner, she worked herself into one of her\r\nfurious rages. I was brushing her hair at the time; and feeling that\r\nmy presence was an impropriety under the circumstances, I attempted to\r\nleave the room. She forbade me to go. Mr. Macallan felt, as I did, that\r\nmy duty was to withdraw, and he said so in plain words. Mrs. Macallan\r\ninsisted on my staying in language so insolent to her husband that he\r\nsaid, \'If you cannot control yourself, either the nurse leaves the room\r\nor I do.\' She refused to yield even then. \'A good excuse,\' she said,\r\n\'for getting back to Mrs. Beauly. Go!\' He took her at her word, and\r\nwalked out of the room. He had barely closed the door before she began\r\nreviling him to me in the most shocking manner. She declared, among\r\nother things she said of him, that the news of all others which he would\r\nbe most glad to hear would be the news of her death. I ventured, quite\r\nrespectfully, on remonstrating with her. She took up the hair-brush and\r\nthrew it at me, and then and there dismissed me from my attendance on\r\nher. I left her, and waited below until her fit of passion had worn\r\nitself out. Then I returned to my place at the bedside, and for a while\r\nthings went on again as usual.\r\n\r\n"It may not be amiss to add a word which may help to explain Mrs.\r\nMacallan\'s jealousy of her husband\'s cousin. Mrs. Macallan was a very\r\nplain woman. She had a cast in one of her eyes, and (if I may use the\r\nexpression) one of the most muddy, blotchy complexions it was ever my\r\nmisfortune to see in a person\'s face. Mrs. Beauly, on the other hand,\r\nwas a most attractive lady. Her eyes were universally admired, and she\r\nhad a most beautifully clear and delicate color. Poor Mrs. Macallan said\r\nof her, most untruly, that she painted.\r\n\r\n"No; the defects in the complexion of the deceased lady were not in\r\nany way attributable to her illness. I should call them born and bred\r\ndefects in herself.\r\n\r\n"Her illness, if I am asked to describe it, I should say was\r\ntroublesome--nothing more. Until the last day there were no symptoms\r\nin the least degree serious about the malady that had taken her.\r\nHer rheumatic knee was painful, of course--acutely painful, if you\r\nlike--when she moved it; and the confinement to bed was irksome enough,\r\nno doubt. But otherwise there was nothing in the lady\'s condition,\r\nbefore the fatal attack came, to alarm her or anybody about her. She had\r\nher books and her writing materials on an invalid table, which worked on\r\na pivot, and could be arranged in any position most agreeable to her.\r\nAt times she read and wrote a good deal. At other times she lay quiet,\r\nthinking her own thoughts, or talking with me, and with one or two lady\r\nfriends in the neighborhood who came regularly to see her.\r\n\r\n"Her writing, so far as I knew, was almost entirely of the poetical\r\nsort. She was a great hand at composing poetry. On one occasion only she\r\nshowed me some of her poems. I am no judge of such things. Her poetry\r\nwas of the dismal kind, despairing about herself, and wondering why she\r\nhad ever been born, and nonsense like that. Her husband came in more\r\nthan once for some hard hits at his cruel heart and his ignorance of his\r\nwife\'s merits. In short, she vented her discontent with her pen as well\r\nas with her tongue. There were times--and pretty often too--when an\r\nangel from heaven would have failed to have satisfied Mrs. Macallan.\r\n\r\n"Throughout the period of her illness the deceased lady occupied the\r\nsame room--a large bedroom situated (like all the best bedrooms) on the\r\nfirst floor of the house.\r\n\r\n"Yes: the plan of the room now shown to me is quite accurately taken,\r\naccording to my remembrance of it. One door led into the great passage,\r\nor corridor, on which all the doors opened. A second door, at one side\r\n(marked B on the plan), led to Mr. Macallan\'s sleeping-room. A third\r\ndoor, on the opposite side (marked C on the plan), communicated with\r\na little study, or book-room, used, as I was told, by Mr. Macallan\'s\r\nmother when she was staying at Gleninch, but seldom or never entered\r\nby any one else. Mr. Macallan\'s mother was not at Gleninch while I was\r\nthere. The door between the bedroom and this study was locked, and the\r\nkey was taken out. I don\'t know who had the key, or whether there\r\nwere more keys than one in existence. The door was never opened to\r\nmy knowledge. I only got into the study, to look at it along with the\r\nhousekeeper, by entering through a second door that opened on to the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n"I beg to say that I can speak from my own knowledge positively about\r\nMrs. Macallan\'s illness, and about the sudden change which ended in\r\nher death. By the doctor\'s advice I made notes at the time of dates and\r\nhours, and such like. I looked at my notes before coming here.\r\n\r\n"From the 7th of October, when I was first called in to nurse her, to\r\nthe 20th of the same month, she slowly but steadily improved in health.\r\nHer knee was still painful, no doubt; but the inflammatory look of it\r\nwas disappearing. As to the other symptoms, except weakness from lying\r\nin bed, and irritability of temper, there was really nothing the matter\r\nwith her. She slept badly, I ought perhaps to add. But we remedied\r\nthis by means of composing draughts prescribed for that purpose by the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"On the morning of the 21st, at a few minutes past six, I got my first\r\nalarm that something was going wrong with Mrs. Macallan.\r\n\r\n"I was awoke at the time I have mentioned by the ringing of the\r\nhand-bell which she kept on her bed-table. Let me say for myself that\r\nI had only fallen asleep on the sofa in the bedroom at past two in the\r\nmorning from sheer fatigue. Mrs. Macallan was then awake. She was in\r\none of her bad humors with me. I had tried to prevail on her to let me\r\nremove her dressing-case from her bed-table, after she had used it in\r\nmaking her toilet for the night. It took up a great deal of room; and\r\nshe could not possibly want it again before the morning. But no; she\r\ninsisted on my letting it be. There was a glass inside the case; and,\r\nplain as she was, she never wearied of looking at herself in that glass.\r\nI saw that she was in a bad state of temper, so I gave her her way, and\r\nlet the dressing-case be. Finding that she was too sullen to speak to me\r\nafter that, and too obstinate to take her composing draught from me\r\nwhen I offered it, I laid me down on the sofa at her bed foot, and fell\r\nasleep, as I have said.\r\n\r\n"The moment her bell rang I was up and at the bedside, ready to make\r\nmyself useful.\r\n\r\n"I asked what was the matter with her. She complained of faintness and\r\ndepression, and said she felt sick. I inquired if she had taken anything\r\nin the way of physic or food while I had been asleep. She answered that\r\nher husband had come in about an hour since, and, finding her still\r\nsleepless, had himself administered the composing draught. Mr. Macallan\r\n(sleeping in the next room) joined us while she was speaking. He too had\r\nbeen aroused by the bell. He heard what Mrs. Macallan said to me about\r\nthe composing draught, and made no remark upon it. It seemed to me that\r\nhe was alarmed at his wife\'s faintness. I suggested that she should take\r\na little wine, or brandy and water. She answered that she could swallow\r\nnothing so strong as wine or brandy, having a burning pain in her\r\nstomach already. I put my hand on her stomach--quite lightly. She\r\nscreamed when I touched her.\r\n\r\n"This symptom alarmed us. We went to the village for the medical man who\r\nhad attended Mrs. Macallan during her illness: one Mr. Gale.\r\n\r\n"The doctor seemed no better able to account for the change for the\r\nworse in his patient than we were. Hearing her complain of thirst, he\r\ngave her some milk. Not long after taking it she was sick. The sickness\r\nappeared to relieve her. She soon grew drowsy and slumbered. Mr. Gale\r\nleft us, with strict injunctions to send for him instantly if she was\r\ntaken ill again.\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort happened; no change took place for the next three\r\nhours or more. She roused up toward half-past nine and inquired about\r\nher husband. I informed her that he had returned to his own room, and\r\nasked if I should send for him. She said \'No.\' I asked next if she would\r\nlike anything to eat or drink. She said \'No\' again, in rather a vacant,\r\nstupefied way, and then told me to go downstairs and get my breakfast.\r\nOn my way down I met the housekeeper. She invited me to breakfast with\r\nher in her room, instead of in the servants\' hall as usual. I remained\r\nwith the housekeeper but a short time--certainly not more than half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n"Coming upstairs again, I met the under-housemaid sweeping on one of the\r\nlandings.\r\n\r\n"The girl informed me that Mrs. Macallan had taken a cup of tea during\r\nmy absence in the housekeeper\'s room. Mr. Macallan\'s valet had ordered\r\nthe tea for his mistress by his master\'s directions. The under-housemaid\r\nmade it, and took it upstairs herself to Mrs. Macallan\'s room. Her\r\nmaster, she said, opened the door when she knocked, and took the tea-cup\r\nfrom her with his own hand. He opened the door widely enough for her to\r\nsee into the bedroom, and to notice that nobody was with Mrs. Macallan\r\nbut himself.\r\n\r\n"After a little talk with the under-housemaid, I returned to the\r\nbedroom. No one was there. Mrs. Macallan was lying perfectly quiet, with\r\nher face turned away from me on the pillow. Approaching the bedside, I\r\nkicked against something on the floor. It was a broken tea-cup. I said\r\nto Mrs. Macallan, \'How comes the tea-cup to be broken, ma\'am?\' She\r\nanswered, without turning toward me, in an odd, muffled kind of voice,\r\n\'I dropped it.\' \'Before you drank your tea, ma\'am?\' I asked. \'No,\' she\r\nsaid; \'in handing the cup back to Mr. Macallan, after I had done.\' I had\r\nput my question, wishing to know, in case she had spilled the tea when\r\nshe dropped the cup, whether it would be necessary to get her any more.\r\nI am quite sure I remember correctly my question and her answer. I\r\ninquired next if she had been long alone. She said, shortly, \'Yes; I\r\nhave been trying to sleep.\' I said, \'Do you feel pretty comfortable?\'\r\nShe answered, \'Yes,\' again. All this time she still kept her face\r\nsulkily turned from me toward the wall. Stooping over her to arrange the\r\nbedclothes, I looked toward her table. The writing materials which were\r\nalways kept on it were disturbed, and there was wet ink on one of the\r\npens. I said, \'Surely you haven\'t been writing, ma\'am?\' \'Why not?\'\r\nshe said; \'I couldn\'t sleep.\' \'Another poem?\' I asked. She laughed to\r\nherself--a bitter, short laugh. \'Yes,\' she said, \'another poem.\' \'That\'s\r\ngood,\' I said; \'it looks as if you were getting quite like yourself\r\nagain. We shan\'t want the doctor any more to-day.\' She made no answer\r\nto this, except an impatient sign with her hand. I didn\'t understand the\r\nsign. Upon that she spoke again, and crossly enough, too--\'I want to be\r\nalone; leave me.\'\r\n\r\n"I had no choice but to do as I was told. To the best of my observation,\r\nthere was nothing the matter with her, and nothing for the nurse to\r\ndo. I put the bell-rope within reach of her hand, and I went downstairs\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Half an hour more, as well as I can guess it, passed. I kept\r\nwithin hearing of the bell; but it never rang. I was not quite at my\r\nease--without exactly knowing why. That odd, muffled voice in which she\r\nhad spoken to me hung on my mind, as it were. I was not quite satisfied\r\nabout leaving her alone for too long a time together--and then, again,\r\nI was unwilling to risk throwing her into one of her fits of passion\r\nby going back before she rang for me. It ended in my venturing into\r\nthe room on the ground-floor called the Morning-Room, to consult Mr.\r\nMacallan. He was usually to be found there in the forenoon of the day.\r\n\r\n"On this occasion, however, when I looked into the Morning-Room it was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n"At the same moment I heard the master\'s voice on the terrace outside.\r\nI went out, and found him speaking to one Mr. Dexter, an old friend of\r\nhis, and (like Mrs. Beauly) a guest staying in the house. Mr. Dexter was\r\nsitting at the window of his room upstairs (he was a cripple, and could\r\nonly move himself about in a chair on wheels), and Mr. Macallan was\r\nspeaking to him from the terrace below.\r\n\r\n"\'Dexter!\' I heard Mr. Macallan say. \'Where is Mrs. Beauly? Have you\r\nseen anything of her?\'\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dexter answered, in his quick, off-hand way of speaking, \'Not I. I\r\nknow nothing about her.\'\r\n\r\n"Then I advanced, and, begging pardon for intruding, I mentioned to Mr.\r\nMacallan the difficulty I was in about going back or not to his wife\'s\r\nroom without waiting until she rang for me. Before he could advise me\r\nin the matter, the footman made his appearance and informed me that Mrs.\r\nMacallan\'s bell was then ringing--and ringing violently.\r\n\r\n"It was then close on eleven o\'clock. As fast as I could mount the\r\nstairs I hastened back to the bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Before I opened the door I heard Mrs. Macallan groaning. She was in\r\ndreadful pain; feeling a burning heat in the stomach and in the throat,\r\ntogether with the same sickness which had troubled her in the early\r\nmorning. Though no doctor, I could see in her face that this second\r\nattack was of a far more serious nature than the first. After ringing\r\nthe bell for a messenger to send to Mr. Macallan, I ran to the door to\r\nsee if any of the servants happened to be within call.\r\n\r\n"The only person I saw in the corridor was Mrs. Beauly. She was on\r\nher way from her own room, she said, to inquire after Mrs. Macallan\'s\r\nhealth. I said to her, \'Mrs. Macallan is seriously ill again, ma\'am.\r\nWould you please tell Mr. Macallan, and send for the doctor?\' She ran\r\ndownstairs at once to do as I told her.\r\n\r\n"I had not been long back at the bedside when Mr. Macallan and Mrs.\r\nBeauly both came in together. Mrs. Macallan cast a strange look on them\r\n(a look I cannot at all describe), and bade them leave her. Mrs.\r\nBeauly, looking very much frightened, withdrew immediately. Mr. Macallan\r\nadvanced a step or two nearer to the bed. His wife looked at him again\r\nin the same strange way, and cried out--half as if she was threatening\r\nhim, half as if she was entreating him--\'Leave me with the nurse. Go!\'\r\nHe only waited to say to me in a whisper, \'The doctor is sent for,\' and\r\nthen he left the room.\r\n\r\n"Before Mr. Gale arrived Mrs. Macallan was violently sick. What came\r\nfrom her was muddy and frothy, and faintly streaked with blood. When Mr.\r\nGale saw it he looked very serious. I heard him say to himself, \'What\r\ndoes this mean?\' He did his best to relieve Mrs. Macallan, but with no\r\ngood result that I could see. After a time she seemed to suffer less.\r\nThen more sickness came on. Then there was another intermission. Whether\r\nshe was suffering or not, I observed that her hands and feet (whenever\r\nI touched them) remained equally cold. Also, the doctor\'s report of her\r\npulse was always the same--\'very small and feeble.\' I said to Mr. Gale,\r\n\'What is to be done, sir?\' And Mr. Gale said to me, \'I won\'t take\r\nthe responsibility on myself any longer; I must have a physician from\r\nEdinburgh.\'\r\n\r\n"The fastest horse in the stables at Gleninch was put into a dog-cart,\r\nand the coachman drove away full speed to Edinburgh to fetch the famous\r\nDoctor Jerome.\r\n\r\n"While we were waiting for the physician, Mr. Macallan came into his\r\nwife\'s room with Mr. Gale. Exhausted as she was, she instantly lifted\r\nher hand and signed to him to leave her. He tried by soothing words to\r\npersuade her to let him stay. No! She still insisted on sending him out\r\nof her room. He seemed to feel it--at such a time, and in the presence\r\nof the doctor. Before she was aware of him, he suddenly stepped up to\r\nthe bedside and kissed her on the forehead. She shrank from him with a\r\nscream. Mr. Gale interfered, and led him out of the room.\r\n\r\n"In the afternoon Doctor Jerome arrived.\r\n\r\n"The great physician came just in time to see her seized with another\r\nattack of sickness. He watched her attentively, without speaking a word.\r\nIn the interval when the sickness stopped, he still studied her, as it\r\nwere, in perfect silence. I thought he would never have done examining\r\nher. When he was at last satisfied, he told me to leave him alone with\r\nMr. Gale. \'We will ring,\' he said, \'when we want you here again.\'\r\n\r\n"It was a long time before they rang for me. The coachman was sent\r\nfor before I was summoned back to the bedroom. He was dispatched to\r\nEdinburgh for the second time, with a written message from Dr. Jerome\r\nto his head servant, saying that there was no chance of his returning to\r\nthe city and to his patients for some hours to come. Some of us thought\r\nthis looked badly for Mrs. Macallan. Others said it might mean that the\r\ndoctor had hopes of saving her, but expected to be a long time in doing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"At last I was sent for. On my presenting myself in the bedroom, Doctor\r\nJerome went out to speak to Mr. Macallan, leaving Mr. Gale along with\r\nme. From that time as long as the poor lady lived I was never left alone\r\nwith her. One of the two doctors was always in her room. Refreshments\r\nwere prepared for them; but still they took it in turns to eat their\r\nmeal, one relieving the other at the bedside. If they had administered\r\nremedies to their patient, I should not have been surprised by this\r\nproceeding. But they were at the end of their remedies; their only\r\nbusiness the seemed to be to keep watch. I was puzzled to account for\r\nthis. Keeping watch was the nurse\'s business. I thought the conduct of\r\nthe doctors very strange.\r\n\r\n"By the time that the lamp was lighted in the sick-room I could see\r\nthat the end was near. Excepting an occasional feeling of cramp in her\r\nlegs, she seemed to suffer less. But her eyes looked sunk in her head;\r\nher skin was cold and clammy; her lips had turned to a bluish paleness.\r\nNothing roused her now--excepting the last attempt made by her\r\nhusband to see her. He came in with Doctor Jerome, looking like a man\r\nterror-struck. She was past speaking; but the moment she saw him she\r\nfeebly made signs and sounds which showed that she was just as resolved\r\nas ever not to let him come near her. He was so overwhelmed that Mr.\r\nGale was obliged to help him out of the room. No other person was\r\nallowed to see the patient. Mr. Dexter and Mrs. Beauly made their\r\ninquiries outside the door, and were not invited in. As the evening drew\r\non the doctors sat on either side of the bed, silently watching her,\r\nsilently waiting for her death.\r\n\r\n"Toward eight o\'clock she seemed to have lost the use of her hands and\r\narms: they lay helpless outside the bed-clothes. A little later she\r\nsank into a sort of dull sleep. Little by little the sound of her heavy\r\nbreathing grew fainter. At twenty minutes past nine Doctor Jerome told\r\nme to bring the lamp to the bedside. He looked at her, and put his hand\r\non her heart. Then he said to me, \'You can go downstairs, nurse: it is\r\nall over.\' He turned to Mr. Gale. \'Will you inquire if Mr. Macallan can\r\nsee us?\' he said. I opened the door for Mr. Gale, and followed him out.\r\nDoctor Jerome called me back for a moment, and told me to give him\r\nthe key of the door. I did so, of course; but I thought this also very\r\nstrange. When I got down to the servants\' hall I found there was a\r\ngeneral feeling that something was wrong. We were all uneasy--without\r\nknowing why.\r\n\r\n"A little later the two doctors left the house. Mr. Macallan had been\r\nquite incapable of receiving them and hearing what they had to say.\r\nIn this difficulty they had spoken privately with Mr. Dexter, as Mr.\r\nMacallan\'s old friend, and the only gentleman then staying at Gleninch.\r\n\r\n"Before bed-time I went upstairs to prepare the remains of the deceased\r\nlady for the coffin. The room in which she lay was locked, the door\r\nleading into Mr. Macallan\'s room being secured, as well as the door\r\nleading into the corridor. The keys had been taken away by Mr. Gale. Two\r\nof the men-servants were posted outside the bedroom to keep watch. They\r\nwere to be relieved at four in the morning--that was all they could tell\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"In the absence of any explanations or directions, I took the liberty of\r\nknocking at the door of Mr. Dexter\'s room. From his lips I first heard\r\nthe startling news. Both the doctors had refused to give the usual\r\ncertificate of death! There was to be a medical examination of the body\r\nthe next morning."\r\n\r\nThere the examination of the nurse, Christina Ormsay, came to an end.\r\n\r\nIgnorant as I was of the law, I could see what impression the evidence\r\n(so far) was intended to produce on the minds of the jury. After first\r\nshowing that my husband had had two opportunities of administering the\r\npoison--once in the medicine and once in the tea--the counsel for\r\nthe Crown led the jury to infer that the prisoner had taken those\r\nopportunities to rid himself of an ugly and jealous wife, whose\r\ndetestable temper he could no longer endure.\r\n\r\nHaving directed his examination to the attainment of this object, the\r\nLord Advocate had done with the witness. The Dean of Faculty--acting in\r\nthe prisoner\'s interests--then rose to bring out the favorable side of\r\nthe wife\'s character by cross-examining the nurse. If he succeeded in\r\nthis attempt, the jury might reconsider their conclusion that the wife\r\nwas a person who had exasperated her husband beyond endurance. In that\r\ncase, where (so far) was the husband\'s motive for poisoning her? and\r\nwhere was the presumption of the prisoner\'s guilt?\r\n\r\nPressed by this skillful lawyer, the nurse was obliged to exhibit my\r\nhusband\'s first wife under an entirely new aspect. Here is the substance\r\nof what the Dean of Faculty extracted from Christina Ormsay:\r\n\r\n"I persist in declaring that Mrs. Macallan had a most violent temper.\r\nBut she was certainly in the habit of making amends for the offense that\r\nshe gave by her violence. When she was quiet again she always made her\r\nexcuses to me, and she made them with a good grace. Her manners were\r\nengaging at such times as these. She spoke and acted like a well-bred\r\nlady. Then, again, as to her personal appearance. Plain as she was in\r\nface, she had a good figure; her hands and feet, I was told, had been\r\nmodeled by a sculptor. She had a very pleasant voice, and she was\r\nreported when in health to sing beautifully. She was also (if her maid\'s\r\naccount was to be trusted) a pattern in the matter of dressing for the\r\nother ladies in the neighborhood. Then, as to Mrs. Beauly, though she\r\nwas certainly jealous of the beautiful young widow, she had shown at\r\nthe same time that she was capable of controlling that feeling. It was\r\nthrough Mrs. Macallan that Mrs. Beauly was in the house. Mrs. Beauly had\r\nwished to postpone her visit on account of the state of Mrs. Macallan\'s\r\nhealth. It was Mrs. Macallan herself--not her husband--who decided that\r\nMrs. Beauly should not be disappointed, and should pay her visit to\r\nGleninch then and there. Further, Mrs. Macallan (in spite of her temper)\r\nwas popular with her friends and popular with her servants. There was\r\nhardly a dry eye in the house when it was known she was dying. And,\r\nfurther still, in those little domestic disagreements at which the nurse\r\nhad been present, Mr. Macallan had never lost his temper, and had never\r\nused harsh language: he seemed to be more sorry than angry when the\r\nquarrels took place."--Moral for the jury: Was this the sort of woman\r\nwho would exasperate a man into poisoning her? And was this the sort of\r\nman who would be capable of poisoning his wife?\r\n\r\nHaving produced this salutary counter-impression, the Dean of Faculty\r\nsat down; and the medical witnesses were called next.\r\n\r\nHere the evidence was simply irresistible.\r\n\r\nDr. Jerome and Mr. Gale positively swore that the symptoms of the\r\nillness were the symptoms of poisoning by arsenic. The surgeon who had\r\nperformed the post-mortem examination followed. He positively swore that\r\nthe appearance of the internal organs proved Doctor Jerome and Mr. Gale\r\nto be right in declaring that their patient had died poisoned. Lastly,\r\nto complete this overwhelming testimony, two analytical chemists\r\nactually produced in Court the arsenic which they had found in the body,\r\nin a quantity admittedly sufficient to have killed two persons instead\r\nof one. In the face of such evidence as this, cross-examination was a\r\nmere form. The first Question raised by the Trial--Did the Woman Die\r\nPoisoned?--was answered in the affirmative, and answered beyond the\r\npossibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nThe next witnesses called were witnesses concerned with the question\r\nthat now followed--the obscure and terrible question, Who Poisoned Her?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. SECOND QUESTION--WHO POISONED HER?\r\n\r\nTHE evidence of the doctors and the chemists closed the proceedings on\r\nthe first day of the Trial.\r\n\r\nOn the second day the evidence to be produced by the prosecution was\r\nanticipated with a general feeling of curiosity and interest. The Court\r\nwas now to hear what had been seen and done by the persons officially\r\nappointed to verify such cases of suspected crime as the case which had\r\noccurred at Gleninch. The Procurator-Fiscal--being the person officially\r\nappointed to direct the preliminary investigations of the law--was the\r\nfirst witness called on the second day of the Trial.\r\n\r\nExamined by the Lord Advocate, the Fiscal gave his evidence, as follows:\r\n\r\n"On the twenty-sixth of October I received a communication from Doctor\r\nJerome, of Edinburgh, and from Mr. Alexander Gale, medical practitioner,\r\nresiding in the village or hamlet of Dingdovie, near Edinburgh. The\r\ncommunication related to the death, under circumstances of suspicion, of\r\nMrs. Eustace Macallan, at her husband\'s house, hard by Dingdovie, called\r\nGleninch. There were also forwarded to me, inclosed in the document\r\njust mentioned, two reports. One described the results of a postmortem\r\nexamination of the deceased lady, and the other stated the discoveries\r\nmade after a chemical analysis of certain of the interior organs of her\r\nbody. The result in both instances proved to demonstration that Mrs.\r\nEustace Macallan had died of poisoning by arsenic.\r\n\r\n"Under these circumstances, I set in motion a search and inquiry in\r\nthe house at Gleninch and elsewhere, simply for the purpose of throwing\r\nlight on the circumstances which had attended the lady\'s death.\r\n\r\n"No criminal charge in connection with the death was made at my office\r\nagainst any person, either in the communication which I received from\r\nthe medical men or in any other form. The investigations at Gleninch and\r\nelsewhere, beginning on the twenty-sixth of October, were not completed\r\nuntil the twenty-eighth. Upon this latter date--acting on certain\r\ndiscoveries which were reported to me, and on my own examination of\r\nletters and other documents brought to my office--I made a criminal\r\ncharge against the prisoner, and obtained a warrant for his\r\napprehension. He was examined before the Sheriff on the twenty-ninth of\r\nOctober, and was committed for trial before this Court."\r\n\r\nThe Fiscal having made his statement, and having been cross-examined (on\r\ntechnical matters only), the persons employed in his office were called\r\nnext. These men had a story of startling interest to tell. Theirs were\r\nthe fatal discoveries which had justified the Fiscal in charging my\r\nhusband with the murder of his wife. The first of the witnesses was a\r\nsheriff\'s officer. He gave his name as Isaiah Schoolcraft.\r\n\r\nExamined by Mr. Drew--Advocate-Depute, and counsel for the Crown, with\r\nthe Lord Advocate--Isaiah Schoolcraft said:\r\n\r\n"I got a warrant on the twenty-sixth of October to go to the\r\ncountry-house near Edinburgh called Gleninch. I took with me Robert\r\nLorrie, assistant to the Fiscal. We first examined the room in which\r\nMrs. Eustace Macallan had died. On the bed, and on a movable table which\r\nwas attached to it, we found books and writing materials, and a paper\r\ncontaining some unfinished verses in manuscript, afterward identified as\r\nbeing in the handwriting of the deceased. We inclosed these articles in\r\npaper, and sealed them up.\r\n\r\n"We next opened an Indian cabinet in the bedroom. Here we found many\r\nmore verses on many more sheets of paper in the same hand-writing. We\r\nalso discovered, first some letters, and next a crumpled piece of paper\r\nthrown aside in a corner of one of the shelves. On closer examination, a\r\nchemist\'s printed label was discovered on this morsel of paper. We also\r\nfound in the folds of it a few scattered grains of some white powder.\r\nThe paper and the letters were carefully inclosed, and sealed up as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Further investigation of the room revealed nothing which could throw\r\nany light on the purpose of our inquiry. We examined the clothes,\r\njewelry, and books of the deceased. These we left under lock and key. We\r\nalso found her dressing-case, which we protected by seals, and took away\r\nwith us to the Fiscal\'s office, along with all the other articles that\r\nwe had discovered in the room.\r\n\r\n"The next day we continued our examination in the house, having received\r\nin the interval fresh instructions from the Fiscal. We began our work in\r\nthe bedroom communicating with the room in which Mrs. Macallan had\r\ndied. It had been kept locked since the death. Finding nothing of any\r\nimportance here, we went next to another room on the same floor, in\r\nwhich we were informed the prisoner was then lying ill in bed.\r\n\r\n"His illness was described to us as a nervous complaint, caused by the\r\ndeath of his wife, and by the proceedings which had followed it. He was\r\nreported to be quite incapable of exerting himself, and quite unfit\r\nto see strangers. We insisted nevertheless (in deference to our\r\ninstructions) on obtaining admission to his room. He made no reply\r\nwhen we inquired whether he had or had not removed anything from the\r\nsleeping-room next to his late wife\'s, which he usually occupied, to the\r\nsleeping-room in which he now lay. All he did was to close his eyes, as\r\nif he were too feeble to speak to us or to notice us. Without further\r\ndisturbing him, we began to examine the room and the different objects\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n"While we were so employed, we were interrupted by a strange sound. We\r\nlikened it to the rumbling of wheels in the corridor outside.\r\n\r\n"The door opened, and there came swiftly in a gentleman--a\r\ncripple--wheeling himself along in a chair. He wheeled his chair\r\nstraight up to a little table which stood by the prisoner\'s bedside, and\r\nsaid something to him in a whisper too low to be overheard. The prisoner\r\nopened his eyes, and quickly answered by a sign. We informed the\r\ncrippled gentleman, quite respectfully, that we could not allow him to\r\nbe in the room at this time. He appeared to think nothing of what we\r\nsaid. He only answered, \'My name is Dexter. I am one of Mr. Macallan\'s\r\nold friends. It is you who are intruding here--not I.\' We again notified\r\nto him that he must leave the room; and we pointed out particularly that\r\nhe had got his chair in such a position against the bedside table as\r\nto prevent us from examining it. He only laughed. \'Can\'t you see for\r\nyourselves,\' he said, \'that it is a table, and nothing more?\' In reply\r\nto this we warned him that we were acting under a legal warrant, and\r\nthat he might get into trouble if he obstructed us in the execution\r\nof our duty. Finding there was no moving him by fair means, I took his\r\nchair and pulled it away, while Robert Lorrie laid hold of the table\r\nand carried it to the other end of the room. The crippled gentleman flew\r\ninto a furious rage with me for presuming to touch his chair. \'My chair\r\nis Me,\' he said: \'how dare you lay hands on Me?\' I first opened the\r\ndoor, and then, by way of accommodating him, gave the chair a good push\r\nbehind with my stick instead of my hand, and so sent it and him safely\r\nand swiftly out of the room.\r\n\r\n"Having locked the door, so as to prevent any further intrusion, I\r\njoined Robert Lorrie in examining the bedside table. It had one drawer\r\nin it, and that drawer we found secured.\r\n\r\n"We asked the prisoner for the key.\r\n\r\n"He flatly refused to give it to us, and said we had no right to unlock\r\nhis drawers. He was so angry that he even declared it was lucky for us\r\nhe was too weak to rise from his bed. I answered civilly that our duty\r\nobliged us to examine the drawer, and that if he still declined to\r\nproduce the key, he would only oblige us to take the table away and have\r\nthe lock opened by a smith.\r\n\r\n"While we were still disputing there was a knock at the door of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"I opened the door cautiously. Instead of the crippled gentleman, whom I\r\nhad expected to see again, there was another stranger standing outside.\r\nThe prisoner hailed him as a friend and neighbor, and eagerly called\r\nupon him for protection from us. We found this second gentleman pleasant\r\nenough to deal with. He informed us readily that he had been sent for\r\nby Mr. Dexter, and that he was himself a lawyer, and he asked to see\r\nour warrant. Having looked at it, he at once informed the prisoner\r\n(evidently very much to the prisoner\'s surprise) that he must submit to\r\nhave the drawer examined, under protest. And then, without more ado, he\r\ngot the key, and opened the table drawer for us himself.\r\n\r\n"We found inside several letters, and a large book with a lock to it,\r\nhaving the words \'My Diary\' inscribed on it in gilt letters. As a matter\r\nof course, we took possession of the letters and the Diary, and sealed\r\nthem up, to be given to the Fiscal. At the same time the gentleman wrote\r\nout a protest on the prisoner\'s behalf, and handed us his card. The\r\ncard informed us that he was Mr. Playmore, now one of the Agents for\r\nthe prisoner. The card and the protest were deposited, with the other\r\ndocuments, in the care of the Fiscal. No other discoveries of any\r\nimportance were made at Gleninch.\r\n\r\n"Our next inquiries took us to Edinburgh--to the druggist whose label\r\nwe had found on the crumpled morsel of paper, and to other druggists\r\nlikewise whom we were instructed to question. On the twenty-eighth of\r\nOctober the Fiscal was in possession of all the information that we\r\ncould collect, and our duties for the time being came to an end."\r\n\r\nThis concluded the evidence of Schoolcraft and Lorrie. It was not shaken\r\non cross-examination, and it was plainly unfavorable to the prisoner.\r\n\r\nMatters grew worse still when the next witnesses were called. The\r\ndruggist whose label had been found on the crumpled bit of paper now\r\nappeared on the stand, to make the position of my unhappy husband more\r\ncritical than ever.\r\n\r\nAndrew Kinlay, druggist, of Edinburgh, deposed as follows:\r\n\r\n"I keep a special registry book of the poisons sold by me. I produce the\r\nbook. On the date therein mentioned the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Eustace\r\nMacallan, came into my shop, and said that he wished to purchase some\r\narsenic. I asked him what it was wanted for. He told me it was wanted by\r\nhis gardener, to be used, in solution, for the killing of insects in\r\nthe greenhouse. At the same time he mentioned his name--Mr. Macallan,\r\nof Gleninch. I at once directed my assistant to put up the arsenic (two\r\nounces of it), and I made the necessary entry in my book. Mr. Macallan\r\nsigned the entry, and I signed it afterward as witness. He paid for the\r\narsenic, and took it away with him wrapped up in two papers, the outer\r\nwrapper being labeled with my name and address, and with the word\r\n\'Poison\' in large letters--exactly like the label now produced on the\r\npiece of paper found at Gleninch."\r\n\r\nThe next witness, Peter Stockdale (also a druggist of Edinburgh),\r\nfollowed, and said:\r\n\r\n"The prisoner at the bar called at my shop on the date indicated on my\r\nregister, some days later than the date indicated in the register of Mr.\r\nKinlay. He wished to purchase sixpenny-worth of arsenic. My assistant,\r\nto whom he had addressed himself, called me. It is a rule in my shop\r\nthat no one sells poisons but myself. I asked the prisoner what he\r\nwanted the arsenic for. He answered that he wanted it for killing rats\r\nat his house, called Gleninch. I said, \'Have I the honor of speaking to\r\nMr. Macallan, of Gleninch?\' He said that was his name. I sold him the\r\narsenic--about an ounce and a half--and labeled the bottle in which\r\nI put it with the word \'Poison\' in my own handwriting. He signed the\r\nregister, and took the arsenic away with him, after paying for it."\r\n\r\nThe cross-examination of the two men succeeded in asserting certain\r\ntechnical objections to their evidence. But the terrible fact that\r\nmy husband himself had actually purchased the arsenic in both cases\r\nremained unshaken.\r\n\r\nThe next witnesses--the gardener and the cook at Gleninch--wound the\r\nchain of hostile evidence around the prisoner more mercilessly still.\r\n\r\nOn examination the gardener said, on his oath:\r\n\r\n"I never received any arsenic from the prisoner, or from any one else,\r\nat the date to which you refer, of at any other date. I never used any\r\nsuch thing as a solution of arsenic, or ever allowed the men working\r\nunder me to use it, in the conservatories or in the garden at Gleninch.\r\nI disapprove of arsenic as a means of destroying noxious insects\r\ninfesting flowers and plants."\r\n\r\nThe cook, being called next, spoke as positively as the gardener:\r\n\r\n"Neither my master nor any other person gave me any arsenic to destroy\r\nrats at any time. No such thing was wanted. I declare, on my oath, that\r\nI never saw any rats in or about the house, or ever heard of any rats\r\ninfesting it."\r\n\r\nOther household servants at Gleninch gave similar evidence. Nothing\r\ncould be extracted from them on cross-examination except that there\r\nmight have been rats in the house, though they were not aware of it. The\r\npossession of the poison was traced directly to my husband, and to no\r\none else. That he had bought it was actually proved, and that he had\r\nkept it was the one conclusion that the evidence justified.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses who came next did their best to press the charge against\r\nthe prisoner home to him. Having the arsenic in his possession, what\r\nhad he done with it? The evidence led the jury to infer what he had done\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner\'s valet deposed that his master had rung for him at twenty\r\nminutes to ten on the morning of the day on which his mistress died, and\r\nhad ordered a cup of tea for her. The man had received the order at the\r\nopen door of Mrs. Macallan\'s room, and could positively swear that no\r\nother person but his master was there at the time.\r\n\r\nThe under-housemaid, appearing next, said that she had made the tea,\r\nand had herself taken it upstairs before ten o\'clock to Mrs. Macallan\'s\r\nroom. Her master had received it from her at the open door. She could\r\nlook in, and could see that he was alone in her mistress\'s room.\r\n\r\nThe nurse, Christina Ormsay, being recalled, repeated what Mrs. Macallan\r\nhad said to her on the day when that lady was first taken ill. She\r\nhad said (speaking to the nurse at six o\'clock in the morning), "Mr.\r\nMacallan came in about an hour since; he found me still sleepless, and\r\ngave me my composing draught." This was at five o\'clock in the morning,\r\nwhile Christina Ormsay was asleep on the sofa. The nurse further swore\r\nthat she had looked at the bottle containing the composing mixture,\r\nand had seen by the measuring marks on the bottle that a dose had been\r\npoured out since the dose previously given, administered by herself.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion special interest was excited by the cross-examination.\r\nThe closing questions put to the under-housemaid and the nurse revealed\r\nfor the first time what the nature of the defense was to be.\r\n\r\nCross-examining the under-housemaid, the Dean of Faculty said:\r\n\r\n"Did you ever notice when you were setting Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s\r\nroom to rights whether the water left in the basin was of a blackish or\r\nbluish color?" The witness answered, "I never noticed anything of the\r\nsort."\r\n\r\nThe Dean of Faculty went on:\r\n\r\n"Did you ever find under the pillow of the bed, or in any other hiding\r\nplace in Mrs. Macallan\'s room, any books or pamphlets telling of\r\nremedies used for improving a bad complexion?" The witness answered,\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThe Dean of Faculty persisted:\r\n\r\n"Did you ever hear Mrs. Macallan speak of arsenic, taken as a wash or\r\ntaken as a medicine, as a good thing to improve the complexion?" The\r\nwitness answered, "Never."\r\n\r\nSimilar questions were next put to the nurse, and were all answered by\r\nthis witness also in the negative.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in spite of the negative answers, was the plan of the\r\ndefense made dimly visible for the first time to the jury and to the\r\naudience. By way of preventing the possibility of a mistake in so\r\nserious a matter, the Chief Judge (the Lord Justice Clerk) put this\r\nplain question, when the witnesses had retired, to the Counsel for the\r\ndefense:\r\n\r\n"The Court and the jury," said his lordship, "wish distinctly to\r\nunderstand the object of your cross-examination of the housemaid and the\r\nnurse. Is it the theory of the defense that Mrs. Eustace Macallan used\r\nthe arsenic which--her husband purchased for the purpose of improving\r\nthe defects of her complexion?"\r\n\r\nThe Dean of Faculty answered:\r\n\r\n"That is what we say, my lord, and what we propose to prove as the\r\nfoundation of the defense. We cannot dispute the medical evidence which\r\ndeclares that Mrs. Macallan died poisoned. But we assert that she died\r\nof an overdose of arsenic, ignorantly taken, in the privacy of her own\r\nroom, as a remedy for the defects--the proved and admitted defects--of\r\nher complexion. The prisoner\'s Declaration before the Sheriff expressly\r\nsets forth that he purchased the arsenic at the request of his wife."\r\n\r\nThe Lord Justice Clerk inquired upon this if there were any objection on\r\nthe part of either of the learned counsel to have the Declaration read\r\nin Court before the Trial proceeded further.\r\n\r\nTo this the Dean of Faculty replied that he would be glad to have the\r\nDeclaration read. If he might use the expression, it would usefully pave\r\nthe way in the minds of the jury for the defense which he had to submit\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Advocate (speaking on the other side) was happy to be able\r\nto accommodate his learned brother in this matter. So long as the mere\r\nassertions which the Declaration contained were not supported by proof,\r\nhe looked upon that document as evidence for the prosecution, and he too\r\nwas quite willing to have it read.\r\n\r\nThereupon the prisoner\'s Declaration of his innocence--on being char\r\nged before the Sheriff with the murder of his wife--was read, in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n"I bought the two packets of arsenic, on each occasion at my wife\'s own\r\nrequest. On the first occasion she told me the poison was wanted by the\r\ngardener for use in the conservatories. On the second occasion she said\r\nit was required by the cook for ridding the lower part of the house of\r\nrats.\r\n\r\n"I handed both packets of arsenic to my wife immediately on my return\r\nhome. I had nothing to do with the poison after buying it. My wife was\r\nthe person who gave orders to the gardener and cook--not I. I never held\r\nany communication with either of them.\r\n\r\n"I asked my wife no questions about the use of the arsenic, feeling no\r\ninterest in the subject. I never entered the conservatories for months\r\ntogether; I care little about flowers. As for the rats, I left the\r\nkilling of them to the cook and the other servants, just as I should\r\nhave left any other part of the domestic business to the cook and the\r\nother servants.\r\n\r\n"My wife never told me she wanted the arsenic to improve her complexion.\r\nSurely I should be the last person admitted to the knowledge of such a\r\nsecret of her toilet as that? I implicitly believed what she told me;\r\nviz., that the poison was wanted for the purposes specified by the\r\ngardener and the cook.\r\n\r\n"I assert positively that I lived on friendly terms with my wife,\r\nallowing, of course, for the little occasional disagreements and\r\nmisunderstandings of married life. Any sense of disappointment in\r\nconnection with my marriage which I might have felt privately I\r\nconceived it to be my duty as a husband and a gentleman to conceal from\r\nmy wife. I was not only shocked and grieved by her untimely death--I\r\nwas filled with fear that I had not, with all my care, behaved\r\naffectionately enough to her in her lifetime.\r\n\r\n"Furthermore, I solemnly declare that I know no more of how she took the\r\narsenic found in her body than the babe unborn. I am innocent even of\r\nthe thought of harming that unhappy woman. I administered the composing\r\ndraught exactly as I found it in the bottle. I afterward gave her the\r\ncup of tea exactly as I received it from the under-housemaid\'s hand. I\r\nnever had access to the arsenic after I placed the two packages in my\r\nwife\'s possession. I am entirely ignorant of what she did with them\r\nor of where she kept them. I declare before God I am innocent of the\r\nhorrible crime with which I am charged."\r\n\r\nWith the reading of those true and touching words the proceedings on the\r\nsecond day of the Trial came to an end.\r\n\r\nSo far, I must own, the effect on me of reading the Report was to\r\ndepress my spirits and to lower my hopes. The whole weight of the\r\nevidence at the close of the second day was against my unhappy husband.\r\nWoman as I was, and partisan as I was, I could plainly see that.\r\n\r\nThe merciless Lord Advocate (I confess I hated him!) had proved (1) that\r\nEustace had bought the poison; (2) that the reason which he had given to\r\nthe druggists for buying the poison was not the true reason; (3) that\r\nhe had had two opportunities of secretly administering the poison to\r\nhis wife. On the other side, what had the Dean of Faculty proved?\r\nAs yet--nothing. The assertions in the prisoner\'s Declaration of his\r\ninnocence were still, as the Lord Advocate had remarked, assertions not\r\nsupported by proof. Not one atom of evidence had been produced to show\r\nthat it was the wife who had secretly used the arsenic, and used it for\r\nher complexion.\r\n\r\nMy one consolation was that the reading of the Trial had already\r\nrevealed to me the helpful figures of two friends on whose sympathy I\r\nmight surely rely. The crippled Mr. Dexter had especially shown himself\r\nto be a thorough good ally of my husband\'s. My heart warmed to the\r\nman who had moved his chair against the bedside table--the man who had\r\nstruggled to the last to defend Eustace\'s papers from the wretches who\r\nhad seized them. I decided then and there that the first person to whom\r\nI would confide my aspirations and my hopes should be Mr. Dexter. If he\r\nfelt any difficulty about advising me, I would then apply next to the\r\nagent, Mr. Playmore--the second good friend, who had formally protested\r\nagainst the seizure of my husband\'s papers.\r\n\r\nFortified by this resolution, I turned the page, and read the history of\r\nthe third day of the Trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. THIRD QUESTION--WHAT WAS HIS MOTIVE?\r\n\r\nTHE first question (Did the Woman Die Poisoned?) had been answered,\r\npositively. The second question (Who Poisoned Her?) had been answered,\r\napparently. There now remained the third and final question--What was\r\nHis Motive? The first evidence called in answer to that inquiry was the\r\nevidence of relatives and friends of the dead wife.\r\n\r\nLady Brydehaven, widow of Rear-Admiral Sir George Brydehaven, examined\r\nby Mr. Drew (counsel for the Crown with the Lord Advocate), gave\r\nevidence as follows:\r\n\r\n"The deceased lady (Mrs. Eustace Macallan) was my niece. She was the\r\nonly child of my sister, and she lived under my roof after the time of\r\nher mother\'s death. I objected to her marriage, on grounds which were\r\nconsidered purely fanciful and sentimental by her other friends. It is\r\nextremely painful to me to state the circumstances in public, but I am\r\nready to make the sacrifice if the ends of justice require it.\r\n\r\n"The prisoner at the bar, at the time of which I am now speaking, was\r\nstaying as a guest in my house. He met with an accident while he was\r\nout riding which caused a serious injury to one of his legs. The leg had\r\nbeen previously hurt while he was serving with the army in India. This\r\ncircumstance tended greatly to aggravate the injury received in the\r\naccident. He was confined to a recumbent position on a sofa for many\r\nweeks together; and the ladies in the house took it in turns to sit with\r\nhim, and while away the weary time by reading to him and talking to him.\r\nMy niece was foremost among these volunteer nurses. She played admirably\r\non the piano; and the sick man happened--most unfortunately, as the\r\nevent proved--to be fond of music.\r\n\r\n"The consequences of the perfectly innocent intercourse thus begun were\r\ndeplorable consequences for my niece. She became passionately attached\r\nto Mr. Eustace Macallan, without awakening any corresponding affection\r\non his side.\r\n\r\n"I did my best to interfere, delicately and usefully, while it was still\r\npossible to interfere with advantage. Unhappily, my niece refused\r\nto place any confidence in me. She persistently denied that she was\r\nactuated by any warmer feeling toward Mr. Macallan than a feeling of\r\nfriendly interest. This made it impossible for me to separate them\r\nwithout openly acknowledging my reason for doing so, and thus producing\r\na scandal which might have affected my niece\'s reputation. My husband\r\nwas alive at that time; and the one thing I could do under the\r\ncircumstances was the thing I did. I requested him to speak privately\r\nto Mr. Macallan, and to appeal to his honor to help us out of the\r\ndifficulty without prejudice to my niece.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Macallan behaved admirably. He was still helpless. But he made an\r\nexcuse for leaving us which it was impossible to dispute. In two days\r\nafter my husband had spoken to him he was removed from the house.\r\n\r\n"The remedy was well intended; but it came too late, and it utterly\r\nfailed. The mischief was done. My niece pined away visibly; neither\r\nmedical help nor change of air and scene did anything for her. In\r\ncourse of time--after Mr. Macallan had recovered from the effects of his\r\naccident--I found that she was carrying on a clandestine correspondence\r\nwith him by means of her maid. His letters, I am bound to say, were most\r\nconsiderately and carefully written. Nevertheless, I felt it my duty to\r\nstop the correspondence.\r\n\r\n"My interference--what else could I do but interfere?--brought matters\r\nto a crisis. One day my niece was missing at breakfast-time. The next\r\nday we discovered that the poor infatuated creature had gone to Mr.\r\nMacallan\'s chambers in London, and had been found hidden in his bedroom\r\nby some bachelor friends who came to visit him.\r\n\r\n"For this disaster Mr. Macallan was in no respect to blame. Hearing\r\nfootsteps outside, he had only time to take measures for saving her\r\ncharacter by concealing her in the nearest room--and the nearest room\r\nhappened to be his bedchamber. The matter was talked about, of course,\r\nand motives were misinterpreted in the vilest manner. My husband\r\nhad another private conversation with Mr. Macallan. He again behaved\r\nadmirably. He publicly declared that my niece had visited him as his\r\nbetrothed wife. In a fortnight from that time he silenced scandal in the\r\none way that was possible--he married her.\r\n\r\n"I was alone in opposing the marriage. I thought it at the time what it\r\nhas proved to be since--a fatal mistake.\r\n\r\n"It would have been sad enough if Mr. Macallan had only married her\r\nwithout a particle of love on his side. But to make the prospect more\r\nhopeless still, he was at that very time the victim of a misplaced\r\nattachment to a lady who was engaged to another man. I am well aware\r\nthat he compassionately denied this, just as he compassionately affected\r\nto be in love with my niece when he married her. But his hopeless\r\nadmiration of the lady whom I have mentioned was a matter of fact\r\nnotorious among his friends. It may not be amiss to add that _her_\r\nmarriage preceded _his_ marriage. He had irretrievably lost the woman\r\nhe really loved--he was without a hope or an aspiration in life--when he\r\ntook pity on my niece.\r\n\r\n"In conclusion, I can only repeat that no evil which could have happened\r\n(if she had remained a single woman) would have been comparable, in\r\nmy opinion, to the evil of such a marriage as this. Never, I sincerely\r\nbelieve, were two more ill-assorted persons united in the bonds of\r\nmatrimony than the prisoner at the bar and his deceased wife."\r\n\r\nThe evidence of this witness produced a strong sensation among\r\nthe audience, and had a marked effect on the minds of the jury.\r\nCross-examination forced Lady Brydehaven to modify some of her opinions,\r\nand to acknowledge that the hopeless attachment of the prisoner to\r\nanother woman was a matter of rumor only. But the facts in her narrative\r\nremained unshaken, and, for that one reason, they invested the crime\r\ncharged against the prisoner with an appearance of possibility, which it\r\nhad entirely failed to assume during the earlier part of the Trial.\r\n\r\nTwo other ladies (intimate friends of Mrs. Eustace Macallan) were\r\ncalled next. They differed from Lady Brydehaven in their opinions on the\r\npropriety of the marriage but on all the material points they supported\r\nher testimony, and confirmed the serious impression which the first\r\nwitness had produced on every person in Court.\r\n\r\nThe next evidence which the prosecution proposed to put in was the\r\nsilent evidence of the letters and the Diary found at Gleninch.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question from the Bench, the Lord Advocate stated that\r\nthe letters were written by friends of the prisoner and his deceased\r\nwife, and that passages in them bore directly on the terms on which the\r\ntwo associated in their married life. The Diary was still more valuable\r\nas evidence. It contained the prisoner\'s daily record of domestic\r\nevents, and of the thoughts and feelings which they aroused in him at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nA most painful scene followed this explanation.\r\n\r\nWriting, as I do, long after the events took place, I still cannot\r\nprevail upon myself to describe in detail what my unhappy husband said\r\nand did at this distressing period of the Trial. Deeply affected\r\nwhile Lady Brydehaven was giving her evidence, he had with difficulty\r\nrestrained himself from interrupting her. He now lost all control\r\nover his feelings. In piercing tones, which rang through the Court,\r\nhe protested against the contemplated violation of his own most sacred\r\nsecrets and his wife\'s most sacred secrets. "Hang me, innocent as I am!"\r\nhe cried, "but spare me _that!_" The effect of this terrible outbreak on\r\nthe audience is reported to have been indescribable. Some of the women\r\npresent were in hysterics. The Judges interfered from the Bench,\r\nbut with no good result. Quiet was at length restored by the Dean of\r\nFaculty, who succeeded in soothing the prisoner, and who then addressed\r\nthe Judges, pleading for indulgence to his unhappy client in most\r\ntouching and eloquent language. The speech, a masterpiece of impromptu\r\noratory, concluded with a temperate yet strongly urged protest against\r\nthe reading of the papers discovered at Gleninch.\r\n\r\nThe three Judges retired to consider the legal question submitted to\r\nthem. The sitting was suspended for more than half an hour.\r\n\r\nAs usual in such cases, the excitement in the Court communicated itself\r\nto the crowd outside in the street. The general opinion here--led, as it\r\nwas supposed, by one of the clerks or other inferior persons connected\r\nwith the legal proceedings--was decidedly adverse to the prisoner\'s\r\nchance of escaping a sentence of death. "If the letters and the Diary\r\nare read," said the brutal spokesman of the mob, "the letters and the\r\nDiary will hang him."\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Judges into Court, it was announced that they had\r\ndecided, by a majority of two to one, on permitting the documents in\r\ndispute to be produced in evidence. Each of the Judges, in turn, gave\r\nhis reasons for the decision at which he had arrived. This done, the\r\nTrial proceeded. The reading of the extracts from the letters and the\r\nextracts from the Diary began.\r\n\r\nThe first letters produced were the letters found in the Indian cabinet\r\nin Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s room. They were addressed to the deceased\r\nlady by intimate (female) friends of hers, with whom she was accustomed\r\nto correspond. Three separate extracts from letters written by three\r\ndifferent correspondents were selected to be read in Court.\r\n\r\nFIRST CORRESPONDENT: "I despair, my dearest Sara, of being able to tell\r\nyou how your last letter has distressed me. Pray forgive me if I own to\r\nthinking that your very sensitive nature exaggerates or misinterprets,\r\nquite unconsciously, of course, the neglect that you experience at the\r\nhands of your husband. I cannot say anything about _his_ peculiarities\r\nof character, because I am not well enough acquainted with him to know\r\nwhat they are. But, my dear, I am much older than you, and I have had a\r\nmuch longer experience than yours of what somebody calls \'the lights and\r\nshadows of married life.\' Speaking from that experience, I must tell you\r\nwhat I have observed. Young married women, like you, who are devotedly\r\nattached to their husbands, are apt to make one very serious mistake. As\r\na rule, they all expect too much from their husbands. Men, my poor Sara,\r\nare not like _us._ Their love, even when it is quite sincere, is not\r\nlike our love. It does not last as it does with us. It is not the\r\none hope and one thought of their lives, as it is with us. We have no\r\nalternative, even when we most truly respect and love them, but to make\r\nallowance for this difference between the man\'s nature and the woman\'s.\r\nI do not for one moment excuse your husband\'s coldness. He is wrong,\r\nfor example, in never looking at you when he speaks to you, and in\r\nnever noticing the efforts that you make to please him. He is worse than\r\nwrong--he is really cruel, if you like--in never returning your kiss\r\nwhen you kiss him. But, my dear, are you quite sure that he is always\r\n_designedly_ cold and cruel? May not his conduct be sometimes the\r\nresult of troubles and anxieties which weigh on his mind, and which are\r\ntroubles and anxieties that you cannot share? If you try to look at his\r\nbehavior in this light, you will understand many things which puzzle\r\nand pain you now. Be patient with him, my child. Make no complaints,\r\nand never approach him with your caresses at times when his mind is\r\npreoccupied or his temper ruffled. This may be hard advice to follow,\r\nloving him as ardently as you do. But, rely on it, the secret of\r\nhappiness for us women is to be found (alas! only too often) in such\r\nexercise of restraint and resignation as your old friend now recommends.\r\nThink, my dear, over what I have written, and let me hear from you\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nSECOND CORRESPONDENT: "How can you be so foolish, Sara, as to waste your\r\nlove on such a cold-blooded brute as your husband seems to be? To be\r\nsure, I am not married yet, or perhaps I should not be so surprised at\r\nyou. But I shall be married one of these days, and if my husband ever\r\ntreat me as Mr. Macallan treats you, I shall insist on a separation. I\r\ndeclare, I think I would rather be actually beaten, like the women among\r\nthe lower orders, than be treated with the polite neglect and contempt\r\nwhich you describe. I burn with indignation when I think of it. It must\r\nbe quite insufferable. Don\'t bear it any longer, my poor dear. Leave\r\nhim, and come and stay with me. My brother is a lawyer, as you know. I\r\nread to him portions of your letter, and he is of opinion that you might\r\nget what he calls a judicial separation. Come and consult him."\r\n\r\nTHIRD CORRESPONDENT: "YOU know, my dear Mrs. Macallan, what _my_\r\nexperience of men has been. Your letter does not surprise me in the\r\nleast. Your husband\'s conduct to you points to one conclusion. He is in\r\nlove with some other woman. There is Somebody in the dark, who gets from\r\nhim everything that he denies to you. I have been through it all--and I\r\nknow! Don\'t give way. Make it the business of your life to find out who\r\nthe creature is. Perhaps there may be more than one of them. It doesn\'t\r\nmatter. One or many, if you can only discover them, you may make his\r\nexistence as miserable to him as he makes your existence to you. If you\r\nwant my experience to help you, say the word, and it is freely at your\r\nservice. I can come and stay with you at Gleninch any time after the\r\nfourth of next month."\r\n\r\nWith those abominable lines the readings from the letters of the women\r\ncame to an end. The first and longest of the Extracts produced the\r\nmost vivid impression in Court. Evidently the writer was in this case\r\na worthy and sensible person. It was generally felt, however, that all\r\nthree of the letters, no matter how widely they might differ in tone,\r\njustified the same conclusion. The wife\'s position at Gleninch (if the\r\nwife\'s account of it were to be trusted) was the position of a neglected\r\nand an unhappy woman.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of the prisoner, which had been found, with his\r\nDiary, in the locked bed-table drawer, was produced next. The letters in\r\nthis case were with one exception all written by men. Though the tone of\r\nthem was moderation itself as compared with the second and third of the\r\nwomen\'s letters, the conclusion still pointed the same way. The life of\r\nthe husband at Gleninch appeared to be just as intolerable as the life\r\nof the wife.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the prisoner\'s male friends wrote inviting him to\r\nmake a yacht voyage around the world. Another suggested an absence\r\nof six months on the Continent. A third recommended field-sports and\r\nfishing. The one object aimed at by all the writers was plainly to\r\ncounsel a separation, more or less plausible and more or less complete,\r\nbetween the married pair.\r\n\r\nThe last letter read was addressed to the prisoner in a woman\'s\r\nhandwriting, and was signed by a woman\'s Christian name only.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my poor Eustace, what a cruel destiny is ours!" the letter began.\r\n"When I think of your life, sacrificed to that wretched woman, my heart\r\nbleeds for you. If _we_ had been man and wife--if it had been _my_\r\nunutterable happiness to love and cherish the best, the dearest of\r\nmen--what a paradise of our own we might have lived in! what delicious\r\nhours we might have known! But regret is vain; we are separated in this\r\nlife--separated by ties which we both mourn, and yet which we must both\r\nrespect. My Eustace, there is a world beyond this. There our souls will\r\nfly to meet each other, and mingle in one long heavenly embrace--in\r\na rapture forbidden to us on earth. The misery described in your\r\nletter--oh, why, why did you marry her?--has wrung this confession of\r\nfeeling from me. Let it comfort you, but let no other eyes see it. Burn\r\nmy rashly written lines, and look (as I look) to the better life which\r\nyou may yet share with your own\r\n\r\n"HELENA."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reading of this outrageous letter provoked a question from the\r\nBench. One of the Judges asked if the writer had attached any date or\r\naddress to her letter.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this the Lord Advocate stated that neither the one nor the\r\nother appeared. The envelope showed that the letter had been posted in\r\nLondon. "We propose," the learned counsel continued, "to read certain\r\npassages from the prisoner\'s Diary, in which the name signed at the\r\nend of the letter occurs more than once; and we may possibly find other\r\nmeans of identifying the writer, to the satisfaction of your lordships,\r\nbefore the Trial is over."\r\n\r\nThe promised passages from my husband\'s private Diary were now read. The\r\nfirst extract related to a period of nearly a year before the date of\r\nMrs. Eustace Macallan\'s death. It was expressed in these terms:\r\n\r\n"News, by this morning\'s post, which has quite overwhelmed me. Helena\'s\r\nhusband died suddenly two days since of heart-disease. She is free--my\r\nbeloved Helena is free! And I?\r\n\r\n"I am fettered to a woman with whom I have not a single feeling in\r\ncommon. Helena is lost to me, by my own act. Ah! I can understand now,\r\nas I never understood before, how irresistible temptation can be, and\r\nhow easily sometimes crime may follow it. I had better shut up these\r\nleaves for the night. It maddens me to no purpose to think of my\r\nposition or to write of it."\r\n\r\nThe next passage, dated a few days later, dwelt on the same subject.\r\n\r\n"Of all the follies that a man can commit, the greatest is acting on\r\nimpulse. I acted on impulse when I married the unfortunate creature who\r\nis now my wife.\r\n\r\n"Helena was then lost to me, as I too hastily supposed. She had married\r\nthe man to whom she rashly engaged herself before she met with me. He\r\nwas younger than I, and, to all appearance, heartier and stronger\r\nthan I. So far as I could see, my fate was sealed for life. Helena had\r\nwritten her farewell letter, taking leave of me in this world for good.\r\nMy prospects were closed; my hopes had ended. I had not an aspiration\r\nleft; I had no necessity to stimulate me to take refuge in work. A\r\nchivalrous action, an exertion of noble self-denial, seemed to be all\r\nthat was left to me, all that I was fit for.\r\n\r\n"The circumstances of the moment adapted themselves, with a fatal\r\nfacility, to this idea. The ill-fated woman who had become attached to\r\nme (Heaven knows--without so much as the shadow of encouragement on my\r\npart!) had, just at that time, rashly placed her reputation at the mercy\r\nof the world. It rested with me to silence the scandalous tongues that\r\nreviled her. With Helena lost to me, happiness was not to be expected.\r\nAll women were equally indifferent to me. A generous action would be\r\nthe salvation of this woman. Why not perform it? I married her on that\r\nimpulse--married her just as I might have jumped into the water and\r\nsaved her if she had been drowning; just as I might have knocked a man\r\ndown if I had seen him ill-treating her in the street!\r\n\r\n"And now the woman for whom I have made this sacrifice stands between me\r\nand my Helena--my Helena, free to pour out all the treasures of her love\r\non the man who adores the earth that she touches with her foot!\r\n\r\n"Fool! madman! Why don\'t I dash out my brains against the wall that I\r\nsee opposite to me while I write these lines?\r\n\r\n"My gun is there in the corner. I have only to tie a string to the\r\ntrigger and to put the muzzle to my mouth--No! My mother is alive; my\r\nmother\'s love is sacred. I have no right to take the life which she gave\r\nme. I must suffer and submit. Oh, Helena! Helena!"\r\n\r\nThe third extract--one among many similar passages--had been written\r\nabout two months before the death of the prisoner\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"More reproaches addressed to me! There never was such a woman for\r\ncomplaining; she lives in a perfect atmosphere of ill-temper and\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\n"My new offenses are two in number: I never ask her to play to me now;\r\nand when she puts on a new dress expressly to please me, I never notice\r\nit. Notice it! Good Heavens! The effort of my life is _not_ to notice\r\nher in anything she does or says. How could I keep my temper, unless I\r\nkept as much as possible out of the way of private interviews with\r\nher? And I do keep my temper. I am never hard on her; I never use harsh\r\nlanguage to her. She has a double claim on my forbearance---she is\r\na woman, and the law has made her my wife. I remember this; but I am\r\nhuman. The less I see of her--except when visitors are present--the\r\nmore certain I can feel of preserving my self-control.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what it is that makes her so utterly distasteful to me? She\r\nis a plain woman; but I have seen uglier women than she whose caresses\r\nI could have endured without the sense of shrinking that comes over me\r\nwhen I am obliged to submit to _her_ caresses. I keep the feeling hidden\r\nfrom her. She loves me, poor thing--and I pity her. I wish I could do\r\nmore; I wish I could return in the smallest degree the feeling with\r\nwhich she regards me. But no--I can only pity her. If she would\r\nbe content to live on friendly terms with me, and never to exact\r\ndemonstrations of tenderness, we might get on pretty well. But she wants\r\nlove. Unfortunate creature, she wants love!\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Helena! I have no love to give her. My heart is yours.\r\n\r\n"I dreamed last night that this unhappy wife of mine was dead. The dream\r\nwas so vivid that I actually got out of my bed and opened the door of\r\nher room and listened.\r\n\r\n"Her calm, regular breathing was distinctly audible in the stillness of\r\nthe night. She was in a deep sleep: I closed the door again and lighted\r\nmy candle and read. Helena was in all my thoughts; it was hard work to\r\nfix my attention on the book. But anything was better than going to bed\r\nagain, and dreaming perhaps for the second time that I too was free.\r\n\r\n"What a life mine is! what a life my wife\'s is! If the house were to\r\ntake fire, I wonder whether I should make an effort to save myself or to\r\nsave her?"\r\n\r\nThe last two passages read referred to later dates still.\r\n\r\n"A gleam of brightness has shone over this dismal existence of mine at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"Helena is no longer condemned to the seclusion of widowhood. Time\r\nenough has passed to permit of her mixing again in society. She is\r\npaying visits to friends in our part of Scotland; and, as she and I are\r\ncousins, it is universally understood that she cannot leave the North\r\nwithout also spending a few days at my house. She writes me word\r\nthat the visit, however embarrassing it may be to us privately, is\r\nnevertheless a visit that must be made for the sake of appearances.\r\nBlessings on appearances! I shall see this angel in my purgatory--and\r\nall because Society in Mid-Lothian would think it strange that my cousin\r\nshould be visiting in my part of Scotland and not visit Me!\r\n\r\n"But we are to be very careful. Helena says, in so many words, \'I come\r\nto see you, Eustace, as a sister. You must receive me as a brother, or\r\nnot receive me at all. I shall write to your wife to propose the day\r\nfor my visit. I shall not forget--do you not forget--that it is by your\r\nwife\'s permission that I enter your house.\'\r\n\r\n"Only let me see her! I will submit to anything to obtain the\r\nunutterable happiness of seeing her!"\r\n\r\nThe last extract followed, and consisted of these lines only:\r\n\r\n"A new misfortune! My wife has fallen ill. She has taken to her bed with\r\na bad rheumatic cold, just at the time appointed for Helena\'s visit\r\nto Gleninch. But on this occasion (I gladly own it!) she has behaved\r\ncharmingly. She has written to Helena to say that her illness is not\r\nserious enough to render a change necessary in the arrangements, and to\r\nmake it her particular request that my cousin\'s visit shall take place\r\nupon the day originally decided on.\r\n\r\n"This is a great sacrifice made to me on my wife\'s part. Jealous of\r\nevery woman under forty who comes near me, she is, of course, jealous of\r\nHelena--and she controls herself, and trusts me!\r\n\r\n"I am bound to show my gratitude for this and I will show it. From this\r\nday forth I vow to live more affectionately with my wife. I tenderly\r\nembraced her this very morning, and I hope, poor soul, she did not\r\ndiscover the effort that it cost me."\r\n\r\nThere the readings from the Diary came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe most unpleasant pages in the whole Report of the Trial were--to\r\nme--the pages which contained the extracts from my husband\'s Diary.\r\nThere were expressions here and there which not only pained me, but\r\nwhich almost shook Eustace\'s position in my estimation. I think I would\r\nhave given everything I possessed to have had the power of annihilating\r\ncertain lines in the Diary. As for his passionate expressions of love\r\nfor Mrs. Beauly, every one of them went through me like a sting. He had\r\nwhispered words quite as warm into my ears in the days of his courtship.\r\nI had no reason to doubt that he truly and dearly loved me. But the\r\nquestion was, Had he just as truly and dearly loved Mrs. Beauly before\r\nme? Had she or I--won the first love of his heart? He had declared to\r\nme over and over again that he had only fancied himself to be in love\r\nbefore the day when we met. I had believed him then. I determined to\r\nbelieve him still. I did believe him. But I hated Mrs. Beauly!\r\n\r\nAs for the painful impression produced in Court by the readings from\r\nthe letters and the Diary, it seemed to be impossible to increase it.\r\nNevertheless it _was_ perceptibly increased. In other words, it was\r\nrendered more unfavorable still toward the prisoner by the evidence of\r\nthe next and last witness called on the part of the prosecution.\r\n\r\nWilliam Enzie, under-gardener at Gleninch, was sworn, and deposed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of October, at eleven o\'clock in the forenoon, I was\r\nsent to work in the shrubbery, on the side next to the garden called the\r\nDutch Garden. There was a summer-house in the Dutch Garden, having its\r\nback set toward the shrubbery. The day was wonderfully fine and--warm\r\nfor the time of year.\r\n\r\n"Passing to my work, I passed the back of the summer-house. I heard\r\nvoices inside--a man\'s voice and a lady\'s voice. The lady\'s voice was\r\nstrange to me. The man\'s voice I recognized as the voice of my master.\r\nThe ground in the shrubbery was soft, and my curiosity was excited. I\r\nstepped up to the back of the summer-house without being heard, and I\r\nlistened to what was going on inside.\r\n\r\n"The first words I could distinguish were spoken in my master\'s voice.\r\nHe said, \'If I could only have foreseen that you might one day be free,\r\nwhat a happy man I might have been!\' The lady\'s voice answered, \'Hush!\r\nyou must not talk so.\' My master said upon that, \'I must talk of what is\r\nin my mind; it is always in my mind that I have lost you.\' He stopped\r\na bit there, and then he said on a sudden, \'Do me one favor, my angel!\r\nPromise me not to marry again.\' The lady\'s voice spoke out thereupon\r\nsharply enough, \'What do you mean?\' My master said, \'I wish no harm to\r\nthe unhappy creature who is a burden on my life; but suppose--\' \'Suppose\r\nnothing,\' the lady said; \'come back to the house.\'\r\n\r\n"She led the way into the garden, and turned round, beckoning my master\r\nto join her. In that position I saw her face plainly, and I knew it for\r\nthe face of the young widow lady who was visiting at the house. She was\r\npointed out to me by the head-gardener when she first arrived, for the\r\npurpose of warning me that I was not to interfere if I found her picking\r\nthe flowers. The gardens at Gleninch were shown to tourists on certain\r\ndays, and we made a difference, of course, in the matter of the flowers\r\nbetween strangers and guests staying in the house. I am quite certain of\r\nthe identity of the lady who was talking with my master. Mrs. Beauly\r\nwas a comely person--and there was no mistaking her for any other than\r\nherself. She and my master withdrew together on the way to the house. I\r\nheard nothing more of what passed between them."\r\n\r\nThis witness was severely cross-examined as to the correctness of his\r\nrecollection of the talk in the summer-house, and as to his capacity for\r\nidentifying both the speakers. On certain minor points he was shaken.\r\nBut he firmly asserted his accurate remembrance of the last words\r\nexchanged between his master and Mrs. Beauly; and he personally\r\ndescribed the lady in terms which proved that he had corruptly\r\nidentified her.\r\n\r\nWith this the answer to the third question raised by the Trial--the\r\nquestion of the prisoner\'s motive for poisoning his wife--came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThe story for the prosecution was now a story told. The staunchest\r\nfriends of the prisoner in Court were compelled to acknowledge that\r\nthe evidence thus far pointed clearly and conclusively against him. He\r\nseemed to feel this himself. When he withdrew at the close of the third\r\nday of the Trial he was so depressed and exhausted that he was obliged\r\nto lean on the arm of the governor of the jail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE.\r\n\r\nTHE feeling of interest excited by the Trial was prodigiously increased\r\non the fourth day. The witnesses for the defense were now to be heard,\r\nand first and foremost among them appeared the prisoner\'s mother. She\r\nlooked at her son as she lifted her veil to take the oath. He burst into\r\ntears. At that moment the sympathy felt for the mother was generally\r\nextended to the unhappy son.\r\n\r\nExamined by the Dean of Faculty, Mrs. Macallan the elder gave her\r\nanswers with remarkable dignity and self-control.\r\n\r\nQuestioned as to certain private conversations which had passed between\r\nher late daughter-in-law and herself, she declared that Mrs. Eustace\r\nMacallan was morbidly sensitive on the subject of her personal\r\nappearance. She was devotedly attached to her husband; the great anxiety\r\nof her life was to make herself as attractive to him as possible.\r\nThe imperfections in her personal appearance--and especially in her\r\ncomplexion--were subjects to her of the bitterest regret. The witness\r\nhad heard her say, over and over again (referring to her complexion),\r\nthat there was no risk she would not run, and no pain she would not\r\nsuffer, to improve it. "Men" (she had said) "are all caught by outward\r\nappearances: my husband might love me better if I had a better color."\r\n\r\nBeing asked next if the passages from her son\'s Diary were to be\r\ndepended on as evidence--that is to say, if they fairly represented\r\nthe peculiarities in his character, and his true sentiments toward his\r\nwife--Mrs. Macallan denied it in the plainest and strongest terms.\r\n\r\n"The extracts from my son\'s Diary are a libel on his character," she\r\nsaid. "And not the less a libel because they happen to be written by\r\nhimself. Speaking from a mother\'s experience of him, I know that he\r\nmust have written the passages produced in moments of uncontrollable\r\ndepression and despair. No just person judges hastily of a man by the\r\nrash words which may escape him in his moody and miserable moments. Is\r\nmy son to be so judged because he happens to have written _his_ rash\r\nwords, instead of speaking them? His pen has been his most deadly enemy,\r\nin this case--it has presented him at his very worst. He was not happy\r\nin his marriage--I admit that. But I say at the same time that he was\r\ninvariably considerate toward his wife. I was implicitly trusted by both\r\nof them; I saw them in their most private moments. I declare--in\r\nthe face of what she appears to have written to her friends and\r\ncorrespondents--that my son never gave his wife any just cause to assert\r\nthat he treated her with cruelty or neglect."\r\n\r\nThe words, firmly and clearly spoken, produced a strong impression.\r\nThe Lord Advocate--evidently perceiving that any attempt to weaken\r\nthat impression would not be likely to succeed--confined himself, in\r\ncross-examination, to two significant questions.\r\n\r\n"In speaking to you of the defects in her complexion," he said, "did\r\nyour daughter-in-law refer in any way to the use of arsenic as a\r\nremedy?"\r\n\r\nThe answer to this was, "No."\r\n\r\nThe Lord Advocate proceeded:\r\n\r\n"Did you yourself ever recommend arsenic, or mention it casually, in the\r\ncourse of the private conversations which you have described?"\r\n\r\nThe answer to this was, "Never."\r\n\r\nThe Lord Advocate resumed his seat. Mrs. Macallan the elder withdrew.\r\n\r\nAn interest of a new kind was excited by the appearance of the next\r\nwitness. This was no less a person than Mrs. Beauly herself. The Report\r\ndescribes her as a remarkably attractive person; modest and lady-like\r\nin her manner, and, to all appearance, feeling sensitively the public\r\nposition in which she was placed.\r\n\r\nThe first portion of her evidence was almost a recapitulation of the\r\nevidence given by the prisoner\'s mother--with this difference, that Mrs.\r\nBeauly had been actually questioned by the deceased lady on the subject\r\nof cosmetic applications to the complexion. Mrs. Eustace Macallan had\r\ncomplimented her on the beauty of her complexion, and had asked what\r\nartificial means she used to keep it in such good order. Using no\r\nartificial means, and knowing nothing whatever of cosmetics, Mrs. Beauly\r\nhad resented the question, and a temporary coolness between the two\r\nladies had been the result.\r\n\r\nInterrogated as to her relations with the prisoner, Mrs. Beauly\r\nindignantly denied that she or Mr. Macallan had ever given the deceased\r\nlady the slightest cause for jealousy. It was impossible for Mrs.\r\nBeauly to leave Scotland, after visiting at the houses of her cousin\'s\r\nneighbors, without also visiting at her cousin\'s house. To take any\r\nother course would have been an act of downright rudeness, and would\r\nhave excited remark. She did not deny that Mr. Macallan had admired her\r\nin the days when they were both single people. But there was no further\r\nexpression of that feeling when she had married another man, and when\r\nhe had married another woman. From that time their intercourse was\r\nthe innocent intercourse of a brother and sister. Mr. Macallan was a\r\ngentleman: he knew what was due to his wife and to Mrs. Beauly--she\r\nwould not have entered the house if experience had not satisfied her of\r\nthat. As for the evidence of the under-gardener, it was little better\r\nthan pure invention. The greater part of the conversation which he had\r\ndescribed himself as overhearing had never taken place. The little that\r\nwas really said (as the man reported it) was said jestingly; and she had\r\nchecked it immediately--as the witness had himself confessed. For the\r\nrest, Mr. Macallan\'s behavior toward his wife was invariably kind\r\nand considerate. He was constantly devising means to alleviate her\r\nsufferings from the rheumatic affection which confined her to her bed;\r\nhe had spoken of her, not once but many times, in terms of the sincerest\r\nsympathy. When she ordered her husband and witness to leave the room, on\r\nthe day of her death, Mr. Macallan said to witness afterward, "We must\r\nbear with her jealousy, poor soul: we know that we don\'t deserve it." In\r\nthat patient manner he submitted to her infirmities of temper from first\r\nto last.\r\n\r\nThe main interest in the cross-examination of Mrs. Beauly centered in\r\na question which was put at the end. After reminding her that she had\r\ngiven her name, on being sworn, as "Helena Beauly," the Lord Advocate\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"A letter addressed to the prisoner, and signed \'Helena,\' has been read\r\nin Court. Look at it, if you please. Are you the writer of that letter?"\r\n\r\nBefore the witness could reply the Dean of Faculty protested against\r\nthe question. The Judges allowed the protest, and refused to permit the\r\nquestion to be put. Mrs. Beauly thereupon withdrew. She had betrayed\r\na very perceptible agitation on hearing the letter referred to, and on\r\nhaving it placed in her hands. This exhibition of feeling was variously\r\ninterpreted among the audience. Upon the whole, however, Mrs. Beauly\'s\r\nevidence was considered to have aided the impression which the mother\'s\r\nevidence had produced in the prisoner\'s favor.\r\n\r\nThe next witnesses--both ladies, and both school friends of Mrs. Eustace\r\nMacallan--created a new feeling of interest in Court. They supplied the\r\nmissing link in the evidence for the defense.\r\n\r\nThe first of the ladies declared that she had mentioned arsenic as a\r\nmeans of improving the complexion in conversation with Mrs. Eustace\r\nMacallan. She had never used it herself, but she had read of the\r\npractice of eating arsenic among the Styrian peasantry for the purpose\r\nof clearing the color, and of producing a general appearance of\r\nplumpness and good health. She positively swore that she had related\r\nthis result of her reading to the deceased lady exactly as she now\r\nrelated it in Court.\r\n\r\nThe second witness, present at the conversation already mentioned,\r\ncorroborated the first witness in every particular; and added that she\r\nhad procured the book relating to the arsenic-eating practices of the\r\nStyrian peasantry, and their results, at Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s own\r\nrequest. This book she had herself dispatched by post to Mrs. Eustace\r\nMacallan at Gleninch.\r\n\r\nThere was but one assailable point in this otherwise conclusive\r\nevidence. The cross-examination discovered it.\r\n\r\nBoth the ladies were asked, in turn, if Mrs. Eustace Macallan had\r\nexpressed to them, directly or indirectly, any intention of obtaining\r\narsenic, with a view to the improvement of her complexion. In each case\r\nthe answer to that all-important question was, No. Mrs. Eustace Macallan\r\nhad heard of the remedy, and had received the book. But of her own\r\nintentions in the future she had not said one word. She had begged both\r\nthe ladies to consider the conversation as strictly private--and there\r\nit had ended.\r\n\r\nIt required no lawyer\'s eye to discern the fatal defect which was now\r\nrevealed in the evidence for the defense. Every intelligent person\r\npresent could see that the prisoner\'s chance of an honorable acquittal\r\ndepended on tracing the poison to the possession of his wife--or at\r\nleast on proving her expressed intention to obtain it. In either of\r\nthese cases the prisoner\'s Declaration of his innocence would claim the\r\nsupport of testimony, which, however indirect it might be, no honest\r\nand intelligent men would be likely to resist. Was that testimony\r\nforthcoming? Was the counsel for the defense not at the end of his\r\nresources yet?\r\n\r\nThe crowded audience waited in breathless expectation for the appearance\r\nof the next witness. A whisper went round among certain well-instructed\r\npersons that the Court was now to see and hear the prisoner\'s old\r\nfriend--already often referred to in the course of the Trial as "Mr.\r\nDexter."\r\n\r\nAfter a brief interval of delay there was a sudden commotion among\r\nthe audience, accompanied by suppressed exclamations of curiosity and\r\nsurprise. At the same moment the crier summoned the new witness by the\r\nextraordinary name of\r\n\r\n"MISERRIMUS DEXTER"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. THE END OF THE TRIAL.\r\n\r\nTHE calling of the new witness provoked a burst of laughter among the\r\naudience due partly, no doubt, to the strange name by which he had\r\nbeen summoned; partly, also, to the instinctive desire of all crowded\r\nassemblies, when their interest is painfully excited, to seize on any\r\nrelief in the shape of the first subject of merriment which may\r\npresent itself. A severe rebuke from the Bench restored order among\r\nthe audience. The Lord Justice Clerk declared that he would "clear the\r\nCourt" if the interruption to the proceedings were renewed.\r\n\r\nDuring the silence which followed this announcement the new witness\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nGliding, self-propelled in his chair on wheels, through the opening made\r\nfor him among the crowd, a strange and startling creature--literally the\r\nhalf of a man--revealed himself to the general view. A coverlet which\r\nhad been thrown over his chair had fallen off during his progress\r\nthrough the throng. The loss of it exposed to the public curiosity\r\nthe head, the arms, and the trunk of a living human being: absolutely\r\ndeprived of the lower limbs. To make this deformity all the more\r\nstriking and all the more terrible, the victim of it was--as to his face\r\nand his body--an unusually handsome and an unusually well-made man. His\r\nlong silky hair, of a bright and beautiful chestnut color, fell over\r\nshoulders that were the perfection of strength and grace. His face was\r\nbright with vivacity and intelligence. His large clear blue eyes and his\r\nlong delicate white hands were like the eyes and hands of a beautiful\r\nwoman. He would have looked effeminate but for the manly proportions\r\nof his throat and chest, aided in their effect by his flowing beard and\r\nlong mustache, of a lighter chestnut shade than the color of his hair.\r\nNever had a magnificent head and body been more hopelessly ill-bestowed\r\nthan in this instance! Never had Nature committed a more careless or a\r\nmore cruel mistake than in the making of this man!\r\n\r\nHe was sworn, seated, of course, in his chair. Having given his name,\r\nhe bowed to the Judges and requested their permission to preface his\r\nevidence with a word of explanation.\r\n\r\n"People generally laugh when they first hear my strange Christian\r\nname," he said, in a low, clear, resonant voice which penetrated to the\r\nremotest corners of the Court. "I may inform the good people here that\r\nmany names, still common among us, have their significations, and that\r\nmine is one of them. \'Alexander,\' for instance, means, in the Greek,\r\n\'a helper of men.\' \'David\' means, in Hebrew, \'well-beloved.\' \'Francis\'\r\nmeans, in German, \'free.\' My name, \'Miserrimus,\' means, in Latin, \'most\r\nunhappy.\' It was given to me by my father, in allusion to the deformity\r\nwhich you all see--the deformity with which it was my misfortune to be\r\nborn. You won\'t laugh at \'Miserrimus\' again, will you?" He turned to the\r\nDean of Faculty, waiting to examine him for the defense. "Mr. Dean. I\r\nam at your service. I apologize for delaying, even for a moment, the\r\nproceedings of the Court."\r\n\r\nHe delivered his little address with perfect grace and good-humor.\r\nExamined by the Dean, he gave his evidence clearly, without the\r\nslightest appearance of hesitation or reserve.\r\n\r\n"I was staying at Gleninch as a guest in the house at the time of Mrs.\r\nEustace Macallan\'s death," he began. "Doctor Jerome and Mr. Gale desired\r\nto see me at a private interview--the prisoner being then in a state of\r\nprostration which made it impossible for him to attend to his duties as\r\nmaster of the house. At this interview the two doctors astonished and\r\nhorrified me by declaring that Mrs. Eustace Macallan had died poisoned.\r\nThey left it to me to communicate the dreadful news to her husband, and\r\nthey warned me that a post-mortem examination must be held on the body.\r\n\r\n"If the Fiscal had seen my old friend when I communicated the doctors\'\r\nmessage, I doubt if he would have ventured to charge the prisoner with\r\nthe murder of his wife. To my mind the charge was nothing less than an\r\noutrage. I resisted the seizure of the prisoner\'s Diary and letters,\r\nanimated by that feeling. Now that the Diary has been produced, I agree\r\nwith the prisoner\'s mother in denying that it is fair evidence to bring\r\nagainst him. A Diary (when it extends beyond a bare record of facts and\r\ndates) is nothing but an expression of the poorest and weakest side in\r\nthe character of the person who keeps it. It is, in nine cases out of\r\nten, the more or less contemptible outpouring of vanity and conceit\r\nwhich the writer dare not exhibit to any mortal but himself. I am the\r\nprisoner\'s oldest friend. I solemnly declare that I never knew he could\r\nwrite downright nonsense until I heard his Diary read in this Court!\r\n\r\n"_He_ kill his wife! _He_ treat his wife with neglect and cruelty! I\r\nventure to say, from twenty years\' experience of him, that there is no\r\nman in this assembly who is constitutionally more incapable of crime and\r\nmore incapable of cruelty than the man who stands at the Bar. While I\r\nam about it, I go further still. I even doubt whether a man capable of\r\ncrime and capable of cruelty could have found it in his heart to do evil\r\nto the woman whose untimely death is the subject of this inquiry.\r\n\r\n"I have heard what the ignorant and prejudiced nurse, Christina Ormsay,\r\nhas said of the deceased lady. From my own personal observation,\r\nI contradict every word of it. Mrs. Eustace Macallan--granting her\r\npersonal defects--was nevertheless one of the most charming women I ever\r\nmet with. She was highly bred, in the best sense of the word. I never\r\nsaw in any other person so sweet a smile as hers, or such grace and\r\nbeauty of movement as hers. If you liked music, she sang beautifully;\r\nand few professed musicians had such a touch on the piano as hers. If\r\nyou preferred talking, I never yet met with the man (or even the woman,\r\nwhich is saying a great deal more) whom her conversation could not\r\ncharm. To say that such a wife as this could be first cruelly neglected,\r\nand then barbarously murdered, by the man--no! by the martyr--who stands\r\nthere, is to tell me that the sun never shines at noonday, or that the\r\nheaven is not above the earth.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! I know that the letters of her friends show that she wrote to\r\nthem in bitter complaint of her husband\'s conduct to her. But remember\r\nwhat one of those friends (the wisest and the best of them) says in\r\nreply. \'I own to thinking,\' she writes, \'that your sensitive nature\r\nexaggerates or misinterprets the neglect that you experience at the\r\nhands of your husband.\' There, in that one sentence, is the whole truth!\r\nMrs. Eustace Macallan\'s nature was the imaginative, self-tormenting\r\nnature of a poet. No mortal love could ever have been refined enough for\r\n_her._ Trifles which women of a coarser moral fiber would have passed\r\nover without notice, were causes of downright agony to that exquisitely\r\nsensitive temperament. There are persons born to be unhappy. That poor\r\nlady was one of them. When I have said this, I have said all.\r\n\r\n"No! There is one word more still to be added.\r\n\r\n"It may be as well to remind the prosecution that Mrs. Eustace\r\nMacallan\'s death was in the pecuniary sense a serious loss to her\r\nhusband. He had insisted on having the whole of her fortune settled on\r\nherself, and on her relatives after her, when he married. Her income\r\nfrom that fortune helped to keep in splendor the house and grounds\r\nat Gleninch. The prisoner\'s own resources (aided even by his mother\'s\r\njointure) were quite inadequate fitly to defray the expenses of living\r\nat his splendid country-seat. Knowing all the circumstances, I can\r\npositively assert that the wife\'s death has deprived the husband of\r\ntwo-thirds of his income. And the prosecution, viewing him as the basest\r\nand cruelest of men, declares that he deliberately killed her--with all\r\nhis pecuniary interests pointing to the preservation of her life!\r\n\r\n"It is useless to ask me whether I noticed anything in the conduct of\r\nthe prisoner and Mrs. Beauly which might justify a wife\'s jealousy. I\r\nnever observed Mrs. Beauly with any attention, and I never encouraged\r\nthe prisoner in talking to me about her. He was a general admirer of\r\npretty women--so far as I know, in a perfectly innocent way. That he\r\ncould prefer Mrs. Beauly to his wife is inconceivable to me, unless he\r\nwere out of his senses. I never had any reason to believe that he was\r\nout of his senses.\r\n\r\n"As to the question of the arsenic--I mean the question of tracing that\r\npoison to the possession of Mrs. Eustace Macallan--I am able to give\r\nevidence which may, perhaps, be worthy of the attention of the Court.\r\n\r\n"I was present in the Fiscal\'s office during the examination of\r\nthe papers, and of the other objects discovered at Gleninch. The\r\ndressing-case belonging to the deceased lady was shown to me after\r\nits contents had been officially investigated by the Fiscal himself. I\r\nhappen to have a very sensitive sense of touch. In handling the lid of\r\nthe dressing-case, on the inner side I felt something at a certain\r\nplace which induced me to examine the whole structure of the lid\r\nvery carefully. The result was the discovery of a private repository\r\nconcealed in the space between the outer wood and the lining. In that\r\nrepository I found the bottle which I now produce."\r\n\r\nThe further examination of the witness was suspended while the\r\nhidden bottle was compared with the bottles properly belonging to the\r\ndressing-case.\r\n\r\nThese last were of the finest cut glass, and of a very elegant\r\nform--entirely unlike the bottle found in the private repository, which\r\nwas of the commonest manufacture, and of the shape ordinarily in use\r\namong chemists. Not a drop of liquid, not the smallest atom of any\r\nsolid substance, remained in it. No smell exhaled from it--and, more\r\nunfortunately still for the interests of the defense, no label was found\r\nattached to the bottle when it had been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe chemist who had sold the second supply of arsenic to the prisoner\r\nwas recalled and examined. He declared that the bottle was exactly like\r\nthe bottle in which he had placed the arsenic. It was, however, equally\r\nlike hundreds of other bottles in his shop. In the absence of the label\r\n(on which he had himself written the word "Poison"), it was impossible\r\nfor him to identify the bottle. The dressing-case and the deceased\r\nlady\'s bedroom had been vainly searched for the chemist\'s missing\r\nlabel--on the chance that it might have become accidentally detached\r\nfrom the mysterious empty bottle. In both instances the search had been\r\nwithout result. Morally, it was a fair conclusion that this might be\r\nreally the bottle which had contained the poison. Legally, there was not\r\nthe slightest proof of it.\r\n\r\nThus ended the last effort of the defense to trace the arsenic purchased\r\nby the prisoner to the possession of his wife. The book relating the\r\npractices of the Styrian peasantry (found in the deceased lady\'s room)\r\nhad been produced. But could the book prove that she had asked her\r\nhusband to buy arsenic for her? The crumpled paper, with the grains\r\nof powder left in it, had been identified by the chemist, and had been\r\ndeclared to contain grains of arsenic. But where was the proof that Mrs.\r\nEustace Macallan\'s hand had placed the packet in the cabinet, and had\r\nemptied it of its contents? No direct evidence anywhere! Nothing but\r\nconjecture!\r\n\r\nThe renewed examination of Miserrimus Dexter touched on matters of no\r\ngeneral interest. The cross-examination resolved itself, in substance,\r\ninto a mental trial of strength between the witness and the Lord\r\nAdvocate; the struggle terminating (according to the general opinion)\r\nin favor of the witness. One question and one answer only I will repeat\r\nhere. They appeared to me to be of serious importance to the object that\r\nI had in view in reading the Trial.\r\n\r\n"I believe, Mr. Dexter," the Lord Advocate remarked, in his most\r\nironical manner, "that you have a theory of your own, which makes the\r\ndeath of Mrs. Eustace Macallan no mystery to _you?_"\r\n\r\n"I may have my own ideas on that subject, as on other subjects," the\r\nwitness replied. "But let me ask their lordships, the Judges: Am I here\r\nto declare theories or to state facts?"\r\n\r\nI made a note of that answer. Mr. Dexter\'s "ideas" were the ideas of\r\na true friend to my husband, and of a man of far more than average\r\nability. They might be of inestimable value to me in the coming time--if\r\nI could prevail on him to communicate them.\r\n\r\nI may mention, while I am writing on the subject, that I added to this\r\nfirst note a second, containing an observation of my own. In alluding to\r\nMrs. Beauly, while he was giving his evidence, Mr. Dexter had spoken of\r\nher so slightingly--so rudely, I might almost say--as to suggest he had\r\nsome strong private reasons for disliking (perhaps for distrusting)\r\nthis lady. Here, again, it might be of vital importance to me to see Mr.\r\nDexter, and to clear up, if I could, what the dignity of the Court had\r\npassed over without notice.\r\n\r\nThe last witness had been now examined. The chair on wheels glided away\r\nwith the half-man in it, and was lost in a distant corner of the Court.\r\nThe Lord Advocate rose to address the Jury for the prosecution.\r\n\r\nI do not scruple to say that I never read anything so infamous as this\r\ngreat lawyer\'s speech. He was not ashamed to declare, at starting, that\r\nhe firmly believed the prisoner to be guilty. What right had he to say\r\nanything of the sort? Was it for _him_ to decide? Was he the Judge\r\nand Jury both, I should like to know? Having begun by condemning the\r\nprisoner on his own authority, the Lord Advocate proceeded to pervert\r\nthe most innocent actions of that unhappy man so as to give them as\r\nvile an aspect as possible. Thus: When Eustace kissed his poor wife\'s\r\nforehead on her death-bed, he did it to create a favorable impression in\r\nthe minds of the doctor and the nurse! Again, when his grief under his\r\nbereavement completely overwhelmed him, he was triumphing in secret,\r\nand acting a part! If you looked into his heart, you would see there\r\na diabolical hatred for his wife and an infatuated passion for Mrs.\r\nBeauly! In everything he had said he had lied; in everything he had done\r\nhe had acted like a crafty and heartless wretch! So the chief counsel\r\nfor the prosecution spoke of the prisoner, standing helpless before him\r\nat the Bar. In my husband\'s place, if I could have done nothing more,\r\nI would have thrown something at his head. As it was, I tore the pages\r\nwhich contained the speech for the prosecution out of the Report and\r\ntrampled them under my feet--and felt all the better too for having done\r\nit. At the same time I feel a little ashamed of having revenged myself\r\non the harmless printed leaves now.\r\n\r\nThe fifth day of the Trial opened with the speech for the defense. Ah,\r\nwhat a contrast to the infamies uttered by the Lord Advocate was\r\nthe grand burst of eloquence by the Dean of Faculty, speaking on my\r\nhusband\'s side!\r\n\r\nThis illustrious lawyer struck the right note at starting.\r\n\r\n"I yield to no one," he began, "in the pity I feel for the wife. But\r\nI say, the martyr in this case, from first to last, is the husband.\r\nWhatever the poor woman may have endured, that unhappy man at the Bar\r\nhas suffered, and is now suffering, more. If he had not been the kindest\r\nof men, the most docile and most devoted of husbands, he would never\r\nhave occupied his present dreadful situation. A man of a meaner and\r\nharder nature would have felt suspicions of his wife\'s motives when\r\nshe asked him to buy poison--would have seen through the wretchedly\r\ncommonplace excuses she made for wanting it--and would have wisely and\r\ncruelly said, \'No.\' The prisoner is not that sort of man. He is too good\r\nto his wife, too innocent of any evil thought toward her, or toward any\r\none, to foresee the inconveniences and the dangers to which his fatal\r\ncompliance may expose him. And what is the result? He stands there,\r\nbranded as a murderer, because he was too high-minded and too honorable\r\nto suspect his wife."\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus of the husband, the Dean was just as eloquent and just as\r\nunanswerable when he came to speak of the wife.\r\n\r\n"The Lord Advocate," he said, "has asked, with the bitter irony for\r\nwhich he is celebrated at the Scottish Bar, why we have failed entirely\r\nto prove that the prisoner placed the two packets of poison in the\r\npossession of his wife. I say, in answer, we have proved, first, that\r\nthe wife was passionately attached to the husband; secondly, that she\r\nfelt bitterly the defects in her personal appearance, and especially\r\nthe defects in her complexion; and, thirdly, that she was informed of\r\narsenic as a supposed remedy for those defects, taken internally. To\r\nmen who know anything of human nature, there is proof enough. Does\r\nmy learned friend actually suppose that women are in the habit of\r\nmentioning the secret artifices and applications by which they improve\r\ntheir personal appearance? Is it in his experience of the sex that a\r\nwoman who is eagerly bent on making herself attractive to a man would\r\ntell that man, or tell anybody else who might communicate with him, that\r\nthe charm by which she hoped to win his heart--say the charm of a pretty\r\ncomplexion--had been artificially acquired by the perilous use of a\r\ndeadly poison? The bare idea of such a thing is absurd. Of course nobody\r\never heard Mrs. Eustace Macallan speak of arsenic. Of course nobody ever\r\nsurprised her in the act of taking arsenic. It is in the evidence\r\nthat she would not even confide her intention to try the poison to the\r\nfriends who had told her of it as a remedy, and who had got her the\r\nbook. She actually begged them to consider their brief conversation on\r\nthe subject as strictly private. From first to last, poor creature, she\r\nkept her secret; just as she would have kept her secret if she had worn\r\nfalse hair, or if she had been indebted to the dentist for her teeth.\r\nAnd there you see her husband, in peril of his life, because a woman\r\nacted _like_ a woman--as your wives, gentlemen of the Jury, would, in a\r\nsimilar position, act toward You."\r\n\r\nAfter such glorious oratory as this (I wish I had room to quote more of\r\nit!), the next, and last, speech delivered at the Trial--that is to say,\r\nthe Charge of the Judge to the Jury--is dreary reading indeed.\r\n\r\nHis lordship first told the Jury that they could not expect to have\r\ndirect evidence of the poisoning. Such evidence hardly ever occurred in\r\ncases of poisoning. They must be satisfied with the best circumstantial\r\nevidence. All quite true, I dare say. But, having told the Jury they\r\nmight accept circumstantial evidence, he turned back again on his own\r\nwords, and warned them against being too ready to trust it! "You must\r\nhave evidence satisfactory and convincing to your own minds," he said,\r\n"in which you find no conjectures--but only irresistible and just\r\ninferences." Who is to decide what is a just inference? And what is\r\ncircumstantial evidence _but_ conjecture?\r\n\r\nAfter this specimen, I need give no further extracts from the summing\r\nup. The Jury, thoroughly bewildered no doubt, took refuge in a\r\ncompromise. They occupied an hour in considering and debating among\r\nthemselves in their own room. (A jury of women would not have taken\r\na minute!) Then they returned into Court, and gave their timid and\r\ntrimming Scotch Verdict in these words:\r\n\r\n"Not Proven."\r\n\r\nSome slight applause followed among the audience, which was instantly\r\nchecked. The prisoner was dismissed from the Bar. He slowly retired,\r\nlike a man in deep grief: his head sunk on his breast--not looking at\r\nany one, and not replying when his friends spoke to him. He knew, poor\r\nfellow, the slur that the Verdict left on him. "We don\'t say you are\r\ninnocent of the crime charged against you; we only say there is not\r\nevidence enough to convict you." In that lame and impotent conclusion\r\nthe proceedings ended at the time. And there they would have remained\r\nfor all time--but for Me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. I SEE MY WAY.\r\n\r\nIN the gray light of the new morning I closed the Report of my husband\'s\r\nTrial for the Murder of his first Wife.\r\n\r\nNo sense of fatigue overpowered me. I had no wish, after my long hours\r\nof reading and thinking, to lie down and sleep. It was strange, but it\r\nwas so. I felt as if I _had_ slept, and had now just awakened--a new\r\nwoman, with a new mind.\r\n\r\nI could now at last understand Eustace\'s desertion of me. To a man of\r\nhis refinement it would have been a martyrdom to meet his wife after she\r\nhad read the things published of him to all the world in the Report. I\r\nfelt that as he would have felt it. At the same time I thought he might\r\nhave trusted Me to make amends to him for the martyrdom, and might\r\nhave come back. Perhaps it might yet end in his coming back. In the\r\nmeanwhile, and in that expectation, I pitied and forgave him with my\r\nwhole heart.\r\n\r\nOne little matter only dwelt on my mind disagreeably, in spite of\r\nmy philosophy. Did Eustace still secretly love Mrs. Beauly? or had I\r\nextinguished that passion in him? To what order of beauty did this lady\r\nbelong? Were we by any chance, the least in the world like one another?\r\n\r\nThe window of my room looked to the east. I drew up the blind, and saw\r\nthe sun rising grandly in a clear sky. The temptation to go out and\r\nbreathe the fresh morning air was irresistible. I put on my hat and\r\nshawl, and took the Report of the Trial under my arm. The bolts of the\r\nback door were easily drawn. In another minute I was out in Benjamin\'s\r\npretty little garden.\r\n\r\nComposed and strengthened by the inviting solitude and the delicious\r\nair, I found courage enough to face the serious question that now\r\nconfronted me--the question of the future.\r\n\r\nI had read the Trial. I had vowed to devote my life to the sacred object\r\nof vindicating my husband\'s innocence. A solitary, defenseless woman, I\r\nstood pledged to myself to carry that desperate resolution through to an\r\nend. How was I to begin?\r\n\r\nThe bold way of beginning was surely the wise way in such a position as\r\nmine. I had good reasons (founded, as I have already mentioned, on the\r\nimportant part played by this witness at the Trial) for believing that\r\nthe fittest person to advise and assist me was--Miserrimus Dexter. He\r\nmight disappoint the expectations that I had fixed on him, or he might\r\nrefuse to help me, or (like my uncle Starkweather) he might think I had\r\ntaken leave of my senses. All these events were possible. Nevertheless,\r\nI held to my resolution to try the experiment. If he were in the land of\r\nthe living, I decided that my first step at starting should take me to\r\nthe deformed man with the strange name.\r\n\r\nSupposing he received me, sympathized with me, understood me? What would\r\nhe say? The nurse, in her evidence, had reported him as speaking in an\r\noff-hand manner. He would say, in all probability, "What do you mean to\r\ndo? And how can I help you to do it?"\r\n\r\nHad I answers ready if those two plain questions were put to me? Yes! if\r\nI dared own to any human creature what was at that very moment secretly\r\nfermenting in my mind. Yes! if I could confide to a stranger a suspicion\r\nroused in me by the Trial which I have been thus far afraid to mention\r\neven in these pages!\r\n\r\nIt must, nevertheless, be mentioned now. My suspicion led to results\r\nwhich are part of my story and part of my life.\r\n\r\nLet me own, then, to begin with, that I closed the record of the Trial\r\nactually agreeing in one important particular with the opinion of my\r\nenemy and my husband\'s enemy--the Lord Advocate! He had characterized\r\nthe explanation of Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s death offered by the defense\r\nas a "clumsy subterfuge, in which no reasonable being could discern the\r\nsmallest fragment of probability." Without going quite so far as this,\r\nI, too, could see no reason whatever in the evidence for assuming\r\nthat the poor woman had taken an overdose of the poison by mistake. I\r\nbelieved that she had the arsenic secretly in her possession, and that\r\nshe had tried, or intended to try, the use of it internally, for the\r\npurpose of improving her complexion. But further than this I could\r\nnot advance. The more I thought of it, the more plainly justified the\r\nlawyers for the prosecution seemed to me to be in declaring that Mrs.\r\nEustace Macallan had died by the hand of a poisoner--although they were\r\nentirely and certainly mistaken in charging my husband with the crime.\r\n\r\nMy husband being innocent, somebody else, on my own showing, must be\r\nguilty. Who among the persons inhabiting the house at the time had\r\npoisoned Mrs. Eustace Macallan? My suspicion in answering that question\r\npointed straight to a woman. And the name of that woman was--Mrs.\r\nBeauly!\r\n\r\nYes! To that startling conclusion I had arrived. It was, to my mind, the\r\ninevitable result of reading the evidence.\r\n\r\nLook back for a moment to the letter produced in court, signed "Helena,"\r\nand addressed to Mr. Macallan. No reasonable person can doubt (though\r\nthe Judges excused her from answering the question) that Mrs. Beauly\r\nwas the writer. Very well. The letter offers, as I think, trustworthy\r\nevidence to show the state of the woman\'s mind when she paid her visit\r\nto Gleninch.\r\n\r\nWriting to Mr. Macallan, at a time when she was married to another\r\nman--a man to whom she had engaged herself before she met with Mr.\r\nMacallan what does she say? She says, "When I think of your life\r\nsacrificed to that wretched woman, my heart bleeds for you." And, again,\r\nshe says, "If it had been my unutterable happiness to love and cherish\r\nthe best, the dearest of men, what a paradise of our own we might have\r\nlived in, what delicious hours we might have known!"\r\n\r\nIf this is not the language of a woman shamelessly and furiously in love\r\nwith a man--not her husband--what is? She is so full of him that even\r\nher idea of another world (see the letter) is the idea of "embracing"\r\nMr. Macallan\'s "soul." In this condition of mind and morals, the lady\r\none day finds herself and her embraces free, through the death of her\r\nhusband. As soon as she can decently visit she goes visiting; and in\r\ndue course of time she becomes the guest of the man whom she adores. His\r\nwife is ill in her bed. The one other visitor at Gleninch is a cripple,\r\nwho can only move in his chair on wheels. The lady has the house and the\r\none beloved object in it all to herself. No obstacle stands between her\r\nand "the unutterable happiness of loving and cherishing the best, the\r\ndearest of men" but a poor, sick, ugly wife, for whom Mr. Macallan never\r\nhas felt, and never can feel, the smallest particle of love.\r\n\r\nIs it perfectly absurd to believe that such a woman as this, impelled by\r\nthese motives, and surrounded by these circumstances, would be capable\r\nof committing a crime--if the safe opportunity offered itself?\r\n\r\nWhat does her own evidence say?\r\n\r\nShe admits that she had a conversation with Mrs. Eustace Macallan, in\r\nwhich that lady questioned her on the subject of cosmetic applications\r\nto the complexion. Did nothing else take place at that interview? Did\r\nMrs. Beauly make no discoveries (afterward turned to fatal account) of\r\nthe dangerous experiment which her hostess was then trying to improve\r\nher ugly complexion? All we know is that Mrs. Beauly said nothing about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhat does the under-gardener say?\r\n\r\nHe heard a conversation between Mr. Macallan and Mrs. Beauly, which\r\nshows that the possibility of Mrs. Beauly becoming Mrs. Eustace Macallan\r\nhad certainly presented itself to that lady\'s mind, and was certainly\r\nconsidered by her to be too dangerous a topic of discourse to be\r\npursued. Innocent Mr. Macallan would have gone on talking. Mrs. Beauly\r\nis discreet and stops him.\r\n\r\nAnd what does the nurse (Christina Ormsay) tell us?\r\n\r\nOn the day of Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s death, the nurse is dismissed from\r\nattendance, and is sent downstairs. She leaves the sick woman, recovered\r\nfrom her first attack of illness, and able to amuse herself with\r\nwriting. The nurse remains away for half an hour, and then gets uneasy\r\nat not hearing the invalid\'s bell. She goes to the Morning-Room to\r\nconsult Mr. Macallan, and there she hears that Mrs. Beauly is missing.\r\nMr. Macallan doesn\'t know where she is, and asks Mr. Dexter if he has\r\nseen her. Mr. Dexter had not set eyes on her. At what time does the\r\ndisappearance of Mrs. Beauly take place? At the very time when Christina\r\nOrmsay had left Mrs. Eustace Macallan alone in her room!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the bell rings at last--rings violently. The nurse goes back\r\nto the sick-room at five minutes to eleven, or thereabouts, and\r\nfinds that the bad symptoms of the morning have returned in a gravely\r\naggravated form. A second dose of poison--larger than the dose\r\nadministered in the early morning--has been given during the absence of\r\nthe nurse, and (observe) during the disappearance also of Mrs. Beauly.\r\nThe nurse looking out into the corridor for help, encounters Mrs. Beauly\r\nherself, innocently on her way from her own room--just up, we are to\r\nsuppose, at eleven in the morning!--to inquire after the sick woman.\r\n\r\nA little later Mrs. Beauly accompanies Mr. Macallan to visit the\r\ninvalid. The dying woman casts a strange look at both of them, and tells\r\nthem to leave her. Mr. Macallan understands this as the fretful outbreak\r\nof a person in pain, and waits in the room to tell the nurse that the\r\ndoctor is sent for. What does Mrs. Beauly do?\r\n\r\nShe runs out panic-stricken the instant Mrs. Eustace Macallan looks at\r\nher. Even Mrs. Beauly, it seems, has a conscience!\r\n\r\nIs there nothing to justify suspicion in such circumstances as\r\nthese--circumstances sworn to on the oaths of the witnesses?\r\n\r\nTo me the conclusion is plain. Mrs. Beauly\'s hand gave that second dose\r\nof poison. Admit this; and the inference follows that she also gave the\r\nfirst dose in the early morning. How could she do it? Look again at\r\nthe evidence. The nurse admits that she was asleep from past two in the\r\nmorning to six. She also speaks of a locked door of communication with\r\nthe sickroom, the key of which had been removed, nobody knew by whom.\r\nSome person must have stolen that key. Why not Mrs. Beauly?\r\n\r\nOne word more, and all that I had in my mind at that time will be\r\nhonestly revealed.\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter, under cross-examination, had indirectly admitted that\r\nhe had ideas of his own on the subject of Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s death.\r\nAt the same time he had spoken of Mrs. Beauly in a tone which plainly\r\nbetrayed that he was no friend to that lady. Did _he_ suspect her too?\r\nMy chief motive in deciding to ask his advice before I applied to any\r\none else was to find an opportunity of putting that question to him. If\r\nhe really thought of her as I did, my course was clear before me. The\r\nnext step to take would be carefully to conceal my identity--and then to\r\npresent myself, in the character of a harmless stranger, to Mrs. Beauly.\r\n\r\nThere were difficulties, of course, in my way. The first and greatest\r\ndifficulty was to obtain an introduction to Miserrimus Dexter.\r\n\r\nThe composing influence of the fresh air in the garden had by this\r\ntime made me readier to lie down and rest than to occupy my mind in\r\nreflecting on my difficulties. Little by little I grew too drowsy\r\nto think--then too lazy to go on walking. My bed looked wonderfully\r\ninviting as I passed by the open window of my room.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes more I had accepted the invitation of the bed, and had\r\nsaid farewell to my anxieties and my troubles. In five minutes more I\r\nwas fast asleep.\r\n\r\nA discreetly gentle knock at my door was the first sound that aroused\r\nme. I heard the voice of my good old Benjamin speaking outside.\r\n\r\n"My dear! I am afraid you will be starved if I let you sleep any longer.\r\nIt is half-past one o\'clock; and a friend of yours has come to lunch\r\nwith us."\r\n\r\nA friend of mine? What friends had I? My husband was far away; and my\r\nuncle Starkweather had given me up in despair.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" I cried out from my bed, through the door.\r\n\r\n"Major Fitz-David," Benjamin answered, by the same medium.\r\n\r\nI sprang out of bed. The very man I wanted was waiting to see me! Major\r\nFitz-David, as the phrase is, knew everybody. Intimate with my husband,\r\nhe would certainly know my husband\'s old friend--Miserrimus Dexter.\r\n\r\nShall I confess that I took particular pains with my toilet, and that\r\nI kept the luncheon waiting? The woman doesn\'t live who would have done\r\notherwise--when she had a particular favor to ask of Major Fitz-David.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. THE MAJOR MAKES DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\nAs I opened the dining-room door the Major hastened to meet me. He\r\nlooked the brightest and the youngest of living elderly gentlemen, with\r\nhis smart blue frock-coat, his winning smile, his ruby ring, and his\r\nready compliment. It was quite cheering to meet the modern Don Juan once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask after your health," said the old gentleman; "your eyes\r\nanswer me, my dear lady, before I can put the question. At your age\r\na long sleep is the true beauty-draught. Plenty of bed--there is the\r\nsimple secret of keeping your good looks and living a long life--plenty\r\nof bed!"\r\n\r\n"I have not been so long in my bed, Major, as you suppose. To tell the\r\ntruth, I have been up all night, reading."\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David lifted his well-painted eyebrows in polite surprise.\r\n\r\n"What is the happy book which has interested you so deeply?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"The book," I answered, "is the Trial of my husband for the murder of\r\nhis first wife."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mention that horrid book!" he exclaimed. "Don\'t speak of\r\nthat dreadful subject! What have beauty and grace to do with Trials,\r\nPoisonings, Horrors? Why, my charming friend, profane your lips by\r\ntalking of such things? Why frighten away the Loves and the Graces that\r\nlie hid in your smile. Humor an old fellow who adores the Loves and the\r\nGraces, and who asks nothing better than to sun himself in your smiles.\r\nLuncheon is ready. Let us be cheerful. Let us laugh and lunch."\r\n\r\nHe led me to the table, and filled my plate and my glass with the air of\r\na man who considered himself to be engaged in one of the most important\r\noccupations of his life. Benjamin kept the conversation going in the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\n"Major Fitz-David brings you some news, my dear," he said. "Your\r\nmother-in-law, Mrs. Macallan, is coming here to see you to-day."\r\n\r\nMy mother-in-law coming to see me! I turned eagerly to the Major for\r\nfurther information.\r\n\r\n"Has Mrs. Macallan heard anything of my husband?" I asked. "Is she\r\ncoming here to tell me about him?"\r\n\r\n"She has heard from him, I believe," said the Major, "and she has also\r\nheard from your uncle the vicar. Our excellent Starkweather has written\r\nto her--to what purpose I have not been informed. I only know that on\r\nreceipt of his letter she has decided on paying you a visit. I met the\r\nold lady last night at a party, and I tried hard to discover whether she\r\nwere coming to you as your friend or your enemy. My powers of persuasion\r\nwere completely thrown away on her. The fact is," said the Major,\r\nspeaking in the character of a youth of five-and-twenty making a modest\r\nconfession, "I don\'t get on well with old women. Take the will for the\r\ndeed, my sweet friend. I have tried to be of some use to you and have\r\nfailed."\r\n\r\nThose words offered me the opportunity for which I was waiting. I\r\ndetermined not to lose it.\r\n\r\n"You can be of the greatest use to me," I said, "if you will allow me to\r\npresume, Major, on your past kindness. I want to ask you a question; and\r\nI may have a favor to beg when you have answered me."\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David set down his wine-glass on its way to his lips, and\r\nlooked at me with an appearance of breathless interest.\r\n\r\n"Command me, my dear lady--I am yours and yours only," said the gallant\r\nold gentleman. "What do you wish to ask me?"\r\n\r\n"I wish to ask if you know Miserrimus Dexter."\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens!" cried the Major; "that _is_ an unexpected question! Know\r\nMiserrimus Dexter? I have known him for more years than I like to reckon\r\nup. What _can_ be your object--"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you what my object is in two words," I interposed. "I want\r\nyou to give me an introduction to Miserrimus Dexter."\r\n\r\nMy impression is that the Major turned pale under his paint. This, at\r\nany rate, is certain--his sparkling little gray eyes looked at me in\r\nundisguised bewilderment and alarm.\r\n\r\n"You want to know Miserrimus Dexter?" he repeated, with the air of a man\r\nwho doubted the evidence of his own senses. "Mr. Benjamin, have I taken\r\ntoo much of your excellent wine? Am I the victim of a delusion--or did\r\nour fair friend really ask me to give her an introduction to Miserrimus\r\nDexter?"\r\n\r\nBenjamin looked at me in some bewilderment on his side, and answered,\r\nquite seriously,\r\n\r\n"I think you said so, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I certainly said so," I rejoined. "What is there so very surprising in\r\nmy request?"\r\n\r\n"The man is mad!" cried the Major. "In all England you could not\r\nhave picked out a person more essentially unfit to be introduced to a\r\nlady--to a young lady especially--than Dexter. Have you heard of his\r\nhorrible deformity?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard of it--and it doesn\'t daunt me."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t daunt you? My dear lady, the man\'s mind is as deformed as his\r\nbody. What Voltaire said satirically of the character of his countrymen\r\nin general is literally true of Miserrimus Dexter. He is a mixture of\r\nthe tiger and the monkey. At one moment he would frighten you, and at\r\nthe next he would set you screaming with laughter. I don\'t deny that he\r\nis clever in some respects--brilliantly clever, I admit. And I don\'t\r\nsay that he has ever committed any acts of violence, or ever willingly\r\ninjured anybody. But, for all that, he is mad, if ever a man were mad\r\nyet. Forgive me if the inquiry is impertinent. What can your motive\r\npossibly be for wanting an introduction to Miserrimus Dexter?"\r\n\r\n"I want to consult him?"\r\n\r\n"May I ask on what subject?"\r\n\r\n"On the subject of my husband\'s Trial."\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David groaned, and sought a momentary consolation in his\r\nfriend Benjamin\'s claret.\r\n\r\n"That dreadful subject again!" he exclaimed. "Mr. Benjamin, why does she\r\npersist in dwelling on that dreadful subject?"\r\n\r\n"I must dwell on what is now the one employment and the one hope of my\r\nlife," I said. "I have reason to hope that Miserrimus Dexter can help\r\nme to clear my husband\'s character of the stain which the Scotch Verdict\r\nhas left on it. Tiger and monkey as he may be, I am ready to run\r\nthe risk of being introduced to him. And I ask you again--rashly and\r\nobstinately as I fear you will think--to give me the introduction. It\r\nwill put you to no inconvenience. I won\'t trouble you to escort me; a\r\nletter to Mr. Dexter will do."\r\n\r\nThe Major looked piteously at Benjamin, and shook his head. Benjamin\r\nlooked piteously at the Major, and shook _his_ head.\r\n\r\n"She appears to insist on it," said the Major.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Benjamin. "She appears to insist on it."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t take the responsibility, Mr. Benjamin, of sending her alone to\r\nMiserrimus Dexter."\r\n\r\n"Shall I go with her, sir?"\r\n\r\nThe Major reflected. Benjamin, in the capacity of protector, did not\r\nappear to inspire our military friend with confidence. After a moment\'s\r\nconsideration a new idea seemed to strike him. He turned to me.\r\n\r\n"My charming friend," he said, "be more charming than ever--consent to\r\na compromise. Let us treat this difficulty about Dexter from a social\r\npoint of view. What do you say to a little dinner?"\r\n\r\n"A little dinner?" I repeated, not in the least understanding him.\r\n\r\n"A little dinner," the Major reiterated, "at my house. You insist on my\r\nintroducing you to Dexter, and I refuse to trust you alone with that\r\ncrack-brained personage. The only alternative under the circumstances\r\nis to invite him to meet you, and to let you form your own opinion of\r\nhim--under the protection of my roof. Who shall we have to meet you\r\nbesides?" pursued the Major, brightening with hospitable intentions.\r\n"We want a perfect galaxy of beauty around the table, as a species\r\nof compensation when we have got Miserrimus Dexter as one the guests.\r\nMadame Mirliflore is still in London. You would be sure to like her--she\r\nis charming; she possesses your firmness, your extraordinary tenacity\r\nof purpose. Yes, we will have Madame Mirliflore. Who else? Shall we say\r\nLady Clarinda? Another charming person, Mr. Benjamin! You would be sure\r\nto admire her--she is so sympathetic, she resembles in so many respects\r\nour fair friend here. Yes, Lady Clarinda shall be one of us; and you\r\nshall sit next to her, Mr. Benjamin, as a proof of my sincere regard for\r\nyou. Shall we have my young prima donna to sing to us in the evening?\r\nthink so. She is pretty; she will assist in obscuring the deformity of\r\nDexter. Very well; there is our party complete! I will shut myself up\r\nthis evening and approach the question of dinner with my cook. Shall\r\nwe say this day week," asked the Major, taking out his pocketbook, "at\r\neight o\'clock?"\r\n\r\nI consented to the proposed compromise--but not very willingly. With\r\na letter of introduction, I might have seen Miserrimus Dexter that\r\nafternoon. As it was, the "little dinner" compelled me to wait in\r\nabsolute inaction through a whole week. However, there was no help\r\nfor it but to submit. Major Fitz-David, in his polite way, could be\r\nas obstinate as I was. He had evidently made up his mind; and further\r\nopposition on my part would be of no service to me.\r\n\r\n"Punctually at eight, Mr. Benjamin," reiterated the Major. "Put it down\r\nin your book."\r\n\r\nBenjamin obeyed--with a side look at me, which I was at no loss to\r\ninterpret. My good old friend did not relish meeting a man at dinner who\r\nwas described as "half tiger, half monkey;" and the privilege of sitting\r\nnext to Lady Clarinda rather daunted than delighted him. It was all my\r\ndoing, and he too had no choice but to submit. "Punctually at eight,\r\nsir," said poor old Benjamin, obediently recording his formidable\r\nengagement. "Please to take another glass of wine."\r\n\r\nThe Major looked at his watch, and rose--with fluent apologies for\r\nabruptly leaving the table.\r\n\r\n"It is later than I thought," he said. "I have an appointment with a\r\nfriend--a female friend; a most attractive person. You a little remind\r\nme of her, my dear lady--you resemble her in complexion: the same\r\ncreamy paleness. I adore creamy paleness. As I was saying, I have an\r\nappointment with my friend; she does me the honor to ask my opinion on\r\nsome very remarkable specimens of old lace. I have studied old lace. I\r\nstudy everything that can make me useful or agreeable to your enchanting\r\nsex. You won\'t forget our little dinner? I will send Dexter his\r\ninvitation the moment I get home." He took my hand and looked at it\r\ncritically, with his head a little on one side. "A delicious hand," he\r\nsaid; "you don\'t mind my looking at it--you don\'t mind my kissing it, do\r\nyou? A delicious hand is one of my weaknesses. Forgive my weaknesses. I\r\npromise to repent and amend one of these days."\r\n\r\n"At your age, Major, do you think you have much time to lose?" asked a\r\nstrange voice, speaking behind us.\r\n\r\nWe all three looked around toward the door. There stood my husband\'s\r\nmother, smiling satirically, with Benjamin\'s shy little maid-servant\r\nwaiting to announce her.\r\n\r\nMajor Fitz-David was ready with his answer.\r\n\r\nThe old soldier was not easily taken by surprise.\r\n\r\n"Age, my dear Mrs. Macallan, is a purely relative expression," he said.\r\n"There are some people who are never young, and there are other people\r\nwho are never old. I am one of the other people. _Au revoir!_"\r\n\r\nWith that answer the incorrigible Major kissed the tips of his fingers\r\nto us and walked out. Benjamin, bowing with his old-fashioned courtesy,\r\nthrew open the door of his little library, and, inviting Mrs. Macallan\r\nand myself to pass in, left us together in the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMY MOTHER-IN-LAW SURPRISES ME.\r\n\r\nI TOOK a chair at a respectful distance from the sofa on which Mrs.\r\nMacallan seated herself. The old lady smiled, and beckoned to me to take\r\nmy place by her side. Judging by appearances, she had certainly not come\r\nto see me in the character of an enemy. It remained to be discovered\r\nwhether she were really disposed to be my friend.\r\n\r\n"I have received a letter from your uncle the vicar," she began. "He\r\nasks me to visit you, and I am happy--for reasons which you shall\r\npresently hear--to comply with his request. Under other circumstances\r\nI doubt very much, my dear child--strange as the confession may\r\nappear--whether I should have ventured into your presence. My son has\r\nbehaved to you so weakly, and (in my opinion) so inexcusably, that I am\r\nreally, speaking as his mother, almost ashamed to face you."\r\n\r\nWas she in earnest? I listened to her and looked at her in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Your uncle\'s letter," pursued Mrs. Macallan, "tells me how you have\r\nbehaved under your hard trial, and what you propose to do now Eustace\r\nhas left you. Doctor Starkweather, poor man, seems to be inexpressibly\r\nshocked by what you said to him when he was in London. He begs me to use\r\nmy influence to induce you to abandon your present ideas, and to make\r\nyou return to your old home at the Vicarage. I don\'t in the least agree\r\nwith your uncle, my dear. Wild as I believe your plans to be--you have\r\nnot the slightest chance of succeeding in carrying them out--I admire\r\nyour courage, your fidelity, your unshaken faith in my unhappy son,\r\nafter his unpardonable behavior to you. You are a fine creature,\r\nValeria, and I have come here to tell you so in plain words. Give me a\r\nkiss, child. You deserve to be the wife of a hero, and you have married\r\none of the weakest of living mortals. God forgive me for speaking so of\r\nmy own son; but it\'s in my mind, and it must come out!"\r\n\r\nThis way of speaking of Eustace was more than I could suffer, even from\r\nhis mother. I recovered the use of my tongue in my husband\'s defense.\r\n\r\n"I am sincerely proud of your good opinion, dear Mrs. Macallan," I said.\r\n"But you distress me--forgive me if I own it plainly--when I hear you\r\nspeak so disparagingly of Eustace. I cannot agree with you that my\r\nhusband is the weakest of living mortals."\r\n\r\n"Of course not!" retorted the old lady. "You are like all good\r\nwomen--you make a hero of the man you love,--whether he deserve it or\r\nnot. Your husband has hosts of good qualities, child--and perhaps I know\r\nthem better than you do. But his whole conduct, from the moment when he\r\nfirst entered your uncle\'s house to the present time, has been, I say\r\nagain, the conduct of an essentially weak man. What do you think he has\r\ndone now by way of climax? He has joined a charitable brotherhood; and\r\nhe is off to the war in Spain with a red cross on his arm, when he ought\r\nto be here on his knees, asking his wife to forgive him. I say that is\r\nthe conduct of a weak man. Some people might call it by a harder name."\r\n\r\nThis news startled and distressed me. I might be resigned to his leaving\r\nme for a time; but all my instincts as a woman revolted at his placing\r\nhimself in a position of danger during his separation from his wife.\r\nHe had now deliberately added to my anxieties. I thought it cruel of\r\nhim--but I would not confess what I thought to his mother. I affected\r\nto be as cool as she was; and I disputed her conclusions with all the\r\nfirmness that I could summon to help me. The terrible old woman only\r\nwent on abusing him more vehemently than ever.\r\n\r\n"What I complain of in my son," proceeded Mrs. Macallan, "is that he has\r\nentirely failed to understand you. If he had married a fool, his conduct\r\nwould be intelligible enough. He would have done wisely to conceal from\r\na fool that he had been married already, and that he had suffered the\r\nhorrid public exposure of a Trial for the murder of his wife. Then,\r\nagain, he would have been quite right, when this same fool had\r\ndiscovered the truth, to take himself out of her way before she could\r\nsuspect him of poisoning he r--for the sake of the peace and quiet of\r\nboth parties. But you are not a fool. I can see that, after only a short\r\nexperience of you. Why can\'t he see it too? Why didn\'t he trust you\r\nwith his secret from the first, instead of stealing his way into your\r\naffections under an assumed name? Why did he plan (as he confessed to\r\nme) to take you away to the Mediterranean, and to keep you abroad,\r\nfor fear of some officious friends at home betraying him to you as the\r\nprisoner of the famous Trial? What is the plain answer to all these\r\nquestions? What is the one possible explanation of this otherwise\r\nunaccountable conduct? There is only one answer, and one explanation. My\r\npoor, wretched son--he takes after his father; he isn\'t the least like\r\nme!--is weak: weak in his way of judging, weak in his way of acting,\r\nand, like all weak people, headstrong and unreasonable to the last\r\ndegree. There is the truth! Don\'t get red and angry. I am as fond of\r\nhim as you are. I can see his merits too. And one of them is that he has\r\nmarried a woman of spirit and resolution--so faithful and so fond of\r\nhim that she won\'t even let his own mother tell her of his faults. Good\r\nchild! I like you for hating me!"\r\n\r\n"Dear madam, don\'t say that I hate you!" I exclaimed (feeling very much\r\nas if I did hate her, though, for all that). "I only presume to think\r\nthat you are confusing a delicate-minded man with a weak-minded man. Our\r\ndear unhappy Eustace--"\r\n\r\n"Is a delicate-minded man," said the impenetrable Mrs. Macallan,\r\nfinishing my sentence for me. "We will leave it there, my dear, and get\r\non to another subject. I wonder whether we shall disagree about that\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\n"What is the subject, madam?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t tell you if you call me madam. Call me mother. Say, \'What is\r\nthe subject, mother?\'"\r\n\r\n"What is the subject, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Your notion of turning yourself into a Court of Appeal for a new Trial\r\nof Eustace, and forcing the world to pronounce a just verdict on him. Do\r\nyou really mean to try it?"\r\n\r\n"I do!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan considered for a moment grimly with herself.\r\n\r\n"You know how heartily I admire your courage, and your devotion to my\r\nunfortunate son," she said. "You know by this time that _I_ don\'t cant.\r\nBut I cannot see you attempt to perform impossibilities; I cannot let\r\nyou uselessly risk your reputation and your happiness without warning\r\nyou before it is too late. My child, the thing you have got it in your\r\nhead to do is not to be done by you or by anybody. Give it up."\r\n\r\n"I am deeply obliged to you, Mrs. Macallan--"\r\n\r\n"\'Mother!\'"\r\n\r\n"I am deeply obliged to you, mother, for the interest that you take in\r\nme, but I cannot give it up. Right or wrong, risk or no risk, I must and\r\nI will try it!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan looked at me very attentively, and sighed to herself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, youth, youth!" she said to herself, sadly. "What a grand thing\r\nit is to be young!" She controlled the rising regret, and turned on me\r\nsuddenly, almost fiercely, with these words: "What, in God\'s name, do\r\nyou mean to do?"\r\n\r\nAt the instant when she put the question, the idea crossed my mind that\r\nMrs. Macallan could introduce me, if she pleased, to Miserrimus Dexter.\r\nShe must know him, and know him well, as a guest at Gleninch and an old\r\nfriend of her son.\r\n\r\n"I mean to consult Miserrimus Dexter," I answered, boldly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan started back from me with a loud exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n"Are you out of your senses?" she asked.\r\n\r\nI told her, as I had told Major Fitz-David, that I had reason to think\r\nMr. Dexter\'s advice might be of real assistance to me at starting.\r\n\r\n"And I," rejoined Mrs. Macallan, "have reason to think that your whole\r\nproject is a mad one, and that in asking Dexter\'s advice on it you\r\nappropriately consult a madman. You needn\'t start, child! There is no\r\nharm in the creature. I don\'t mean that he will attack you, or be rude\r\nto you. I only say that the last person whom a young woman, placed in\r\nyour painful and delicate position, ought to associate herself with is\r\nMiserrimus Dexter."\r\n\r\nStrange! Here was the Major\'s warning repeated by Mrs. Macallan, almost\r\nin the Major\'s own words. Well! It shared the fate of most warnings. It\r\nonly made me more and more eager to have my own way.\r\n\r\n"You surprise me very much," I said. "Mr. Dexter\'s evidence, given at\r\nthe Trial, seems as clear and reasonable as evidence can be."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is!" answered Mrs. Macallan. "The shorthand writers and\r\nreporters put his evidence into presentable language before they printed\r\nit. If you had heard what he really said, as I did, you would have\r\nbeen either very much disgusted with him or very much amused by him,\r\naccording to your way of looking at things. He began, fairly enough,\r\nwith a modest explanation of his absurd Christian name, which at once\r\nchecked the merriment of the audience. But as he went on the mad side\r\nof him showed itself. He mixed up sense and nonsense in the strangest\r\nconfusion; he was called to order over and over again; he was even\r\nthreatened with fine and imprisonment for contempt of Court. In short,\r\nhe was just like himself--a mixture of the strangest and the most\r\nopposite qualities; at one time perfectly clear and reasonable, as\r\nyou said just now; at another breaking out into rhapsodies of the most\r\noutrageous kind, like a man in a state of delirium. A more entirely\r\nunfit person to advise anybody, I tell you again, never lived. You don\'t\r\nexpect Me to introduce you to him, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"I did think of such a thing," I answered. "But after what you have\r\nsaid, dear Mrs. Macallan, I give up the idea, of course. It is not\r\na great sacrifice--it only obliges me to wait a week for Major\r\nFitz-David\'s dinner-party. He has promised to ask Miserrimus Dexter to\r\nmeet me."\r\n\r\n"There is the Major all over!" cried the old lady. "If you pin your\r\nfaith on that man, I pity you. He is as slippery as an eel. I suppose\r\nyou asked him to introduce you to Dexter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Exactly! Dexter despises him, my dear. He knows as well as I do that\r\nDexter won\'t go to his dinner. And he takes that roundabout way of\r\nkeeping you apart, instead of saying No to you plainly, like an honest\r\nman."\r\n\r\nThis was bad news. But I was, as usual, too obstinate to own myself\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n"If the worst comes to the worst," I said, "I can but write to Mr.\r\nDexter, and beg him to grant me an interview."\r\n\r\n"And go to him by yourself, if he does grant it?" inquired Mrs.\r\nMacallan.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. By myself."\r\n\r\n"You really mean it?"\r\n\r\n"I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t allow you to go by yourself."\r\n\r\n"May I venture to ask, ma\'am how you propose to prevent me?"\r\n\r\n"By going with you, to be sure, you obstinate hussy! Yes, yes--I can be\r\nas headstrong as you are when I like. Mind! I don\'t want to know what\r\nyour plans are. I don\'t want to be mixed up with your plans. My son is\r\nresigned to the Scotch Verdict. I am resigned to the Scotch Verdict.\r\nIt is you who won\'t let matters rest as they are. You are a vain and\r\nfoolhardy young person. But, somehow, I have taken a liking to you,\r\nand I won\'t let you go to Miserrimus Dexter by yourself. Put on your\r\nbonnet!"\r\n\r\n"Now?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Certainly! My carriage is at the door. And the sooner it\'s over the\r\nbetter I shall be pleased. Get ready--and be quick about it!"\r\n\r\nI required no second bidding. In ten minutes more we were on our way to\r\nMiserrimus Dexter.\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of my mother-in-law\'s visit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. MISERRIMUS DEXTER--FIRST VIEW.\r\n\r\nWE had dawdled over our luncheon before Mrs. Macallan arrived at\r\nBenjamin\'s cottage. The ensuing conversation between the old lady and\r\nmyself (of which I have only presented a brief abstract) lasted until\r\nquite late in the afternoon. The sun was setting in heavy clouds when we\r\ngot into the carriage, and the autumn twilight began to fall around us\r\nwhile we were still on the road.\r\n\r\nThe direction in which we drove took us (as well as I could judge)\r\ntoward the great northern suburb of London.\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour the carriage threaded its way through a dingy\r\nbrick labyrinth of streets, growing smaller and smaller and dirtier and\r\ndirtier the further we went. Emerging from the labyrinth, I noticed in\r\nthe gathering darkness dreary patches of waste ground which seemed to\r\nbe neither town nor country. Crossing these, we passed some forlorn\r\noutlying groups of houses with dim little scattered shops among them,\r\nlooking like lost country villages wandering on the way to London,\r\ndisfigured and smoke-dried already by their journey. Darker and darker\r\nand drearier and drearier the prospect drew, until the carriage stopped\r\nat last, and Mrs. Macallan announced, in her sharply satirical way,\r\nthat we had reached the end of our journey. "Prince Dexter\'s Palace, my\r\ndear," she said. "What do you think of it?"\r\n\r\nI looked around me, not knowing what to think of it, if the truth must\r\nbe told.\r\n\r\nWe had got out of the carriage, and we were standing on a rough\r\nhalf-made gravel-path. Right and left of me, in the dim light, I saw\r\nthe half-completed foundations of new houses in their first stage of\r\nexistence. Boards and bricks were scattered about us. At places gaunt\r\nscaffolding poles rose like the branchless trees of the brick desert.\r\nBehind us, on the other side of the high-road, stretched another plot\r\nof waste ground, as yet not built on. Over the surface of this second\r\ndesert the ghostly white figures of vagrant ducks gleamed at intervals\r\nin the mystic light. In front of us, at a distance of two hundred yards\r\nor so as well as I could calculate, rose a black mass, which gradually\r\nresolved itself, as my eyes became accustomed to the twilight, into\r\na long, low, and ancient house, with a hedge of evergreens and a\r\npitch-black paling in front of it. The footman led the way toward the\r\npaling through the boards and the bricks, the oyster shells and the\r\nbroken crockery, that strewed the ground. And this was "Prince Dexter\'s\r\nPalace!"\r\n\r\nThere was a gate in the pitch-black paling, and a\r\nbell-handle--discovered with great difficulty. Pulling at the handle,\r\nthe footman set in motion, to judge by the sound produced, a bell of\r\nprodigious size, fitter for a church than a house.\r\n\r\nWhile we were waiting for admission, Mrs. Macallan pointed to the low,\r\ndark line of the old building.\r\n\r\n"There is one of his madnesses," she said. "The speculators in this new\r\nneighborhood have offered him I don\'t know how many thousand pounds for\r\nthe ground that house stands on. It was originally the manor-house of\r\nthe district. Dexter purchased it many years since in one of his freaks\r\nof fancy. He has no old family associations with the place; the walls\r\nare all but tumbling about his ears; and the money offered would really\r\nbe of use to him. But no! He refused the proposal of the enterprising\r\nspeculators by letter in these words: \'My house is a standing monument\r\nof the picturesque and beautiful, amid the mean, dishonest, and\r\ngroveling constructions of a mean, dishonest, and groveling age. I keep\r\nmy house, gentlemen, as a useful lesson to you. Look at it while you\r\nare building around me, and blush, if you can, for your work.\' Was there\r\never such an absurd letter written yet? Hush! I hear footsteps in the\r\ngarden. Here comes his cousin. His cousin is a woman. I may as well tell\r\nyou that, or you might mistake her for a man in the dark."\r\n\r\nA rough, deep voice, which I should certainly never have supposed to be\r\nthe voice of a woman, hailed us from the inner side of the paling.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Macallan," answered my mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"We want to see Dexter."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t see him."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"What did you say your name was?"\r\n\r\n"Macallan. Mrs. Macallan. Eustace Macallan\'s mother. _Now_ do you\r\nunderstand?"\r\n\r\nThe voice muttered and grunted behind the paling, and a key turned in\r\nthe lock of the gate.\r\n\r\nAdmitted to the garden, in the deep shadow of the shrubs, I could see\r\nnothing distinctly of the woman with the rough voice, except that she\r\nwore a man\'s hat. Closing the gate behind us, without a word of welcome\r\nor explanation, she led the way to the house. Mrs. Macallan followed her\r\neasily, knowing the place; and I walked in Mrs. Macallan\'s footsteps as\r\nclosely as I could. "This is a nice family," my mother-in-law whispered\r\nto me. "Dexter\'s cousin is the only woman in the house--and Dexter\'s\r\ncousin is an idiot."\r\n\r\nWe entered a spacious hall with a low ceiling, dimly lighted at its\r\nfurther end by one small oil-lamp. I could see that there were pictures\r\non the grim, brown walls, but the subjects represented were invisible in\r\nthe obscure and shadowy light.\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan addressed herself to the speechless cousin with the man\'s\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n"Now tell me," she said. "Why can\'t we see Dexter?"\r\n\r\nThe cousin took a sheet of paper off the table, and handed it to Mrs.\r\nMacallan.\r\n\r\n"The Master\'s writing," said this strange creature, in a hoarse whisper,\r\nas if the bare idea of "the Master" terrified her. "Read it. And stay or\r\ngo, which you please."\r\n\r\nShe opened an invisible side door in the wall, masked by one of the\r\npictures--disappeared through it like a ghost--and left us together\r\nalone in the hall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan approached the oil-lamp, and looked by its light at the\r\nsheet of paper which the woman had given to her. I followed and\r\npeeped over her shoulder without ceremony. The paper exhibited written\r\ncharacters, traced in a wonderfully large and firm handwriting. Had I\r\ncaught the infection of madness in the air of the house? Or did I really\r\nsee before me these words?\r\n\r\n"NOTICE.--My immense imagination is at work. Visions of heroes unroll\r\nthemselves before me. I reanimate in myself the spirits of the departed\r\ngreat. My brains are boiling in my head. Any persons who disturb\r\nme, under existing circumstances, will do it at the peril of their\r\nlives.--DEXTER."\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan looked around at me quietly with her sardonic smile.\r\n\r\n"Do you still persist in wanting to be introduced to him?" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe mockery in the tone of the question roused my pride. I determined\r\nthat I would not be the first to give way.\r\n\r\n"Not if I am putting you in peril of your life, ma\'am," I answered,\r\npertly enough, pointing to the paper in her hand.\r\n\r\nMy mother-in-law returned to the hall table, and put the paper back on\r\nit without condescending to reply. She then led the way to an arched\r\nrecess on our right hand, beyond which I dimly discerned a broad flight\r\nof oaken stairs.\r\n\r\n"Follow me," said Mrs. Macallan, mounting the stairs in the dark. "I\r\nknow where to find him."\r\n\r\nWe groped our way up the stairs to the first landing. The next flight of\r\nsteps, turning in the reverse direction, was faintly illuminated, like\r\nthe hall below, by one oil-lamp, placed in some invisible position above\r\nus. Ascending the second flight of stairs and crossing a short corridor,\r\nwe discovered the lamp, through the open door of a quaintly shaped\r\ncircular room, burning on the mantel-piece. Its light illuminated a\r\nstrip of thick tapestry, hanging loose from the ceiling to the floor, on\r\nthe wall opposite to the door by which we had entered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan drew aside the strip of tapestry, and, signing me to\r\nfollow her, passed behind it.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" she whispered.\r\n\r\nStanding on the inner side of the tapestry, I found myself in a dark\r\nrecess or passage, at the end of which a ray of light from the lamp\r\nshowed me a closed door. I listened, and heard on the other side of\r\nthe door a shouting voice, accompanied by an extraordinary rumbling\r\nand whistling sound, traveling backward and forward, as well as I could\r\njudge, over a great space. Now the rumbling and the whistling would\r\nreach their climax of loudness, and would overcome the resonant notes of\r\nthe shouting voice. Then again those louder sounds gradually retreated\r\ninto distance, and the shouting voice made itself heard as the more\r\naudible sound of the two. The door must have been of prodigious\r\nsolidity. Listen as intently as I might, I failed to catch the\r\narticulate words (if any) which the voice was pronouncing, and I was\r\nequally at a loss to penetrate the cause which produced the rumbling and\r\nwhistling sounds.\r\n\r\n"What can possibly be going on," I whispered to Mrs. Macallan, "on the\r\nother side of that door?"\r\n\r\n"Step softly," my mother-in-law answered, "and come and see."\r\n\r\nShe arranged the tapestry behind us so as completely to shut out the\r\nlight in the circular room. Then noiselessly turning the handle, she\r\nopened the heavy door.\r\n\r\nWe kept ourselves concealed in the shadow of the recess, and looked\r\nthrough the open doorway.\r\n\r\nI saw (or fancied I saw, in the obscurity) a long room with a low\r\nceiling. The dying gleam of an ill-kept fire formed the only light by\r\nwhich I could judge of objects and distances. Redly illuminating the\r\ncentral portion of the room, opposite to which we were standing, the\r\nfire-light left the extremities shadowed in almost total darkness. I\r\nhad barely time to notice this before I heard the rumbling and whistling\r\nsounds approaching me. A high chair on wheels moved by, through the\r\nfield of red light, carrying a shadowy figure with floating hair, and\r\narms furiously raised and lowered working the machinery that propelled\r\nthe chair at its utmost rate of speed. "I am Napoleon, at the sunrise\r\nof Austerlitz!" shouted the man in the chair as he swept past me on his\r\nrumbling and whistling wheels, in the red glow of the fire-light. "I\r\ngive the word, and thrones rock, and kings fall, and nations tremble,\r\nand men by tens of thousands fight and bleed and die!" The chair rushed\r\nout of sight, and the shouting man in it became another hero. "I\r\nam Nelson!" the ringing voice cried now. "I am leading the fleet at\r\nTrafalgar. I issue my commands, prophetically conscious of victory and\r\ndeath. I see my own apotheosis, my public funeral, my nation\'s tears, my\r\nburial in the glorious church. The ages remember me, and the poets sing\r\nmy praise in immortal verse!" The strident wheels turned at the far end\r\nof the room and came back. The fantastic and frightful apparition,\r\nman and machinery blended in one--the new Centaur, half man, half\r\nchair--flew by me again in the dying light. "I am Shakespeare!"\r\ncried the frantic creature now. "I am writing \'Lear,\' the tragedy of\r\ntragedies. Ancients and moderns, I am the poet who towers over them\r\nall. Light! light! the lines flow out like lava from the eruption of my\r\nvolcanic mind. Light! light! for the poet of all time to write the words\r\nthat live forever!" He ground and tore his way back toward the middle of\r\nthe room. As he approached the fire-place a last morsel of unburned coal\r\n(or wood) burst into momentary flame, and showed the open doorway. In\r\nthat moment he saw us! The wheel-chair stopped with a shock that shook\r\nthe crazy old floor of the room, altered its course, and flew at us\r\nwith the rush of a wild animal. We drew back, just in time to escape it,\r\nagainst the wall of the recess. The chair passed on, and burst aside the\r\nhanging tapestry. The light of the lamp in the circular room poured in\r\nthrough the gap. The creature in the chair checked his furious wheels,\r\nand looked back over his shoulder with an impish curiosity horrible to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n"Have I run over them? Have I ground them to powder for presuming to\r\nintrude on me?" he said to himself. As the expression of this amiable\r\ndoubt passed his lips his eyes lighted on us. His mind instantly veered\r\nback again to Shakespeare and King Lear. "Goneril and Regan!" he cried.\r\n"My two unnatural daughters, my she-devil children come to mock at me!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort," said my mother-in-law, as quietly as if she were\r\naddressing a perfectly reasonable being. "I am your old friend, Mrs.\r\nMacallan; and I have brought Eustace Macallan\'s second wife to see you."\r\n\r\nThe instant she pronounced those last words, "Eustace Macallan\'s second\r\nwife," the man in the chair sprang out of it with a shrill cry of\r\nhorror, as if she had shot him. For one moment we saw a head and body in\r\nthe air, absolutely deprived of the lower limbs. The moment after,\r\nthe terrible creature touched the floor as lightly as a monkey, on his\r\nhands. The grotesque horror of the scene culminated in his hopping away\r\non his hands, at a prodigious speed, until he reached the fire-place in\r\nthe long room. There he crouched over the dying embers, shuddering and\r\nshivering, and muttering, "Oh, pity me, pity me!" dozens and dozens of\r\ntimes to himself.\r\n\r\nThis was the man whose advice I had come to ask--who assistance I had\r\nconfidently counted on in my hour of need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. MISERRIMUS DEXTER--SECOND VIEW\r\n\r\nTHOROUGHLY disheartened and disgusted, and (if I must honestly confess\r\nit) thoroughly frightened too, I whispered to Mrs. Macallan, "I was\r\nwrong, and you were right. Let us go."\r\n\r\nThe ears of Miserrimus Dexter must have been as sensitive as the ears of\r\na dog. He heard me say, "Let us go."\r\n\r\n"No!" he called out. "Bring Eustace Macallan\'s second wife in here. I\r\nam a gentleman--I must apologize to her. I am a student of human\r\ncharacter--I wish to see her."\r\n\r\nThe whole man appeared to have undergone a complete transformation. He\r\nspoke in the gentlest of voices, and he sighed hysterically when he had\r\ndone, like a woman recovering from a burst of tears. Was it reviving\r\ncourage or reviving curiosity? When Mrs. Macallan said to me, "The fit\r\nis over now; do you still wish to go away?" I answered, "No; I am ready\r\nto go in."\r\n\r\n"Have you recovered your belief in him already?" asked my mother-in-law,\r\nin her mercilessly satirical way.\r\n\r\n"I have recovered from my terror of him," I replied.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I terrified you," said the soft voice at the fire-place.\r\n"Some people think I am a little mad at times. You came, I suppose,\r\nat one of the times--if some people are right. I admit that I am a\r\nvisionary. My imagination runs away with me, and I say and do strange\r\nthings. On those occasions, anybody who reminds me of that horrible\r\nTrial throws me back again into the past, and causes me unutterable\r\nnervous suffering. I am a very tender-hearted man. As the necessary\r\nconsequence (in such a world as this), I am a miserable wretch. Accept\r\nmy excuses. Come in, both of you. Come in and pity me."\r\n\r\nA child would not have been frightened of him now. A child would have\r\ngone in and pitied him.\r\n\r\nThe room was getting darker and darker. We could just see the crouching\r\nfigure of Miserrimus Dexter at the expiring fire--and that was all.\r\n\r\n"Are we to have no light?" asked Mrs. Macallan. "And is this lady to see\r\nyou, when the light comes, out of your chair?"\r\n\r\nHe lifted something bright and metallic, hanging round his neck, and\r\nblew on it a series of shrill, trilling, bird-like notes. After an\r\ninterval he was answered by a similar series of notes sounding faintly\r\nin some distant region of the house.\r\n\r\n"Ariel is coming," he said. "Compose yourself, Mamma Macallan; Ariel\r\nwith make me presentable to a lady\'s eyes."\r\n\r\nHe hopped away on his hands into the darkness at the end of the\r\nroom. "Wait a little," said Mrs. Macallan, "and you will have another\r\nsurprise--you will see the \'delicate Ariel.\'"\r\n\r\nWe heard heavy footsteps in the circular room.\r\n\r\n"Ariel!" sighed Miserrimus Dexter out of the darkness, in his softest\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nTo my astonishment the coarse, masculine voice of the cousin in the\r\nman\'s hat--the Caliban\'s, rather than the Ariel\'s voice--answered,\r\n"Here!"\r\n\r\n"My chair, Ariel!"\r\n\r\nThe person thus strangely misnamed drew aside the tapestry, so as to let\r\nin more light; then entered the room, pushing the wheeled chair before\r\nher. She stooped and lifted Miserrimus Dexter from the floor, like a\r\nchild. Before she could put him into the chair, he sprang out of her\r\narms with a little gleeful cry, and alighted on his seat, like a bird\r\nalighting on its perch!\r\n\r\n"The lamp," said Miserrimus Dexter, "and the looking-glass.--Pardon me,"\r\nhe added, addressing us, "for turning my back on you. You mustn\'t see\r\nme until my hair is set to rights.--Ariel! the brush, the comb, and the\r\nperfumes!"\r\n\r\nCarrying the lamp in one hand, the looking-glass in the other, and the\r\nbrush (with the comb stuck in it) between her teeth, Ariel the Second,\r\notherwise Dexter\'s cousin, presented herself plainly before me for the\r\nfirst time. I could now see the girl\'s round, fleshy, inexpressive\r\nface, her rayless and colorless eyes, her coarse nose and heavy chin. A\r\ncreature half alive; an imperfectly developed animal in shapeless form\r\nclad in a man\'s pilot jacket, and treading in a man\'s heavy laced boots,\r\nwith nothing but an old red-flannel petticoat, and a broken comb in\r\nher frowzy flaxen hair, to tell us that she was a woman--such was the\r\ninhospitable person who had received us in the darkness when we first\r\nentered the house.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful valet, collecting her materials for dressing her\r\nstill more wonderful master\'s hair, gave him the looking-glass (a\r\nhand-mirror), and addressed herself to her work.\r\n\r\nShe combed, she brushed, she oiled, she perfumed the flowing locks and\r\nthe long silky beard of Miserrimus Dexter with the strangest mixture of\r\ndullness and dexterity that I ever saw. Done in brute silence, with\r\na lumpish look and a clumsy gait, the work was perfectly well done\r\nnevertheless. The imp in the chair superintended the whole proceeding\r\ncritically by means of his hand-mirror. He was too deeply interested\r\nin this occupation to speak until some of the concluding touches to his\r\nbeard brought the misnamed Ariel in front of him, and so turned her\r\nfull face toward the part of the room in which Mrs. Macallan and I were\r\nstanding. Then he addressed us, taking especial care, however, not to\r\nturn his head our way while his toilet was still incomplete.\r\n\r\n"Mamma Macallan," he said, "what is the Christian name of your son\'s\r\nsecond wife?"\r\n\r\n"Why do you want to know?" asked my mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"I want to know because I can\'t address her as \'Mrs. Eustace Macallan.\'"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"It recalls _the other_ Mrs. Eustace Macallan. If I am reminded of those\r\nhorrible days at Gleninch my fortitude will give way--I shall burst out\r\nscreaming again."\r\n\r\nHearing this, I hastened to interpose.\r\n\r\n"My name is Valeria," I said.\r\n\r\n"A Roman name," remarked Miserrimus Dexter. "I like it. My mind is cast\r\nin the Roman mold. My bodily build would have been Roman if I had been\r\nborn with legs. I shall call you Mrs. Valeria, unless you disapprove of\r\nit."\r\n\r\nI hastened to say that I was far from disapproving of it.\r\n\r\n"Very good," said Miserrimus Dexter "Mrs. Valeria, do you see the face\r\nof this creature in front of me?"\r\n\r\nHe pointed with the hand-mirror to his cousin as unconcernedly as he\r\nmight have pointed to a dog. His cousin, on her side, took no more\r\nnotice than a dog would have taken of the contemptuous phrase by which\r\nhe had designated her. She went on combing and oiling his beard as\r\ncomposedly as ever.\r\n\r\n"It is the face of an idiot, isn\'t it?" pursued Miserrimus Dexter! "Look\r\nat her! She is a mere vegetable. A cabbage in a garden has as much life\r\nand expression in it as that girl exhibits at the present moment. Would\r\nyou believe there was latent intelligence, affection, pride, fidelity,\r\nin such a half-developed being as this?"\r\n\r\nI was really ashamed to answer him. Quite needlessly! The impenetrable\r\nyoung woman went on with her master\'s beard. A machine could not\r\nhave taken less notice of the life and the talk around it than this\r\nincomprehensible creature.\r\n\r\n"_I_ have got at that latent affection, pride, fidelity, and the rest\r\nof it," resumed Miserrimus Dexter. "_I_ hold the key to that dormant\r\nIntelligence. Grand thought! Now look at her when I speak. (I named\r\nher, poor wretch, in one of my ironical moments. She has got to like her\r\nname, just as a dog gets to like his collar.) Now, Mrs. Valeria, look\r\nand listen.--Ariel!"\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s dull face began to brighten. The girl\'s mechanically moving\r\nhand stopped, and held the comb in suspense.\r\n\r\n"Ariel! you have learned to dress my hair and anoint my beard, haven\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nHer face still brightened. "Yes! yes! yes!" she answered, eagerly. "And\r\nyou say I have learned to do it well, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I say that. Would you like to let anybody else do it for you?"\r\n\r\nHer eyes melted softly into light and life. Her strange unwomanly voice\r\nsank to the gentlest tones that I had heard from her yet.\r\n\r\n"Nobody else shall do it for me," she said at once proudly and tenderly.\r\n"Nobody, as long as I live, shall touch you but me."\r\n\r\n"Not even the lady there?" asked Miserrimus Dexter, pointing backward\r\nwith his hand-mirror to the place at which I was standing.\r\n\r\nHer eyes suddenly flashed, her hand suddenly shook the comb at me, in a\r\nburst of jealous rage.\r\n\r\n"Let her try!" cried the poor creature, raising her voice again to its\r\nhoarsest notes. "Let her touch you if she dares!"\r\n\r\nDexter laughed at the childish outbreak. "That will do, my delicate\r\nAriel," he said. "I dismiss your Intelligence for the present. Relapse\r\ninto your former self. Finish my beard."\r\n\r\nShe passively resumed her work. The new light in her eyes, the new\r\nexpression in her face, faded little by little and died out. In another\r\nminute the face was as vacant and as lumpish as before; the hands did\r\ntheir work again with the lifeless dexterity which had so painfully\r\nimpressed me when she first took up the brush. Miserrimus Dexter\r\nappeared to be perfectly satisfied with these results.\r\n\r\n"I thought my little experiment might interest you," he said. "You see\r\nhow it is? The dormant intelligence of my curious cousin is like the\r\ndormant sound in a musical instrument. I play upon it--and it answers to\r\nmy touch. She likes being played upon. But her great delight is to hear\r\nme tell a story. I puzzle her to the verge of distraction; and the more\r\nI confuse her the better she likes the story. It is the greatest fun;\r\nyou really must see it some day." He indulged himself in a last look\r\nat the mirror. "Ha!" he said, complacently; "now I shall do. Vanish,\r\nAriel!"\r\n\r\nShe tramped out of the room in her heavy boots, with the mute obedience\r\nof a trained animal. I said "Good-night" as she passed me. She neither\r\nreturned the salutation nor looked at me: the words simply produced\r\nno effect on her dull senses. The one voice that could reach her was\r\nsilent. She had relapsed once more into the vacant inanimate creature\r\nwho had opened the gate to us, until it pleased Miserrimus Dexter to\r\nspeak to her again.\r\n\r\n"Valeria!" said my mother-in-law. "Our modest host is waiting to see\r\nwhat you think of him."\r\n\r\nWhile my attention was fixed on his cousin he had wheeled his chair\r\naround so as to face me with the light of the lamp falling full on him.\r\nIn mentioning his appearance as a witness at the Trial, I find I have\r\nborrowed (without meaning to do so) from my experience of him at this\r\nlater time. I saw plainly now the bright intelligent face and the large\r\nclear blue eyes, the lustrous waving hair of a light chestnut color, the\r\nlong delicate white hands, and the magnificent throat and chest which I\r\nhave elsewhere described. The deformity which degraded and destroyed the\r\nmanly beauty of his head and breast was hidden from view by an Oriental\r\nrobe of many colors, thrown over the chair like a coverlet. He was\r\nclothed in a jacket of black velvet, fastened loosely across his chest\r\nwith large malachite buttons; and he wore lace ruffles at the ends of\r\nhis sleeves, in the fashion of the last century. It may well have been\r\ndue to want of perception on my part--but I could see nothing mad in\r\nhim, nothing in any way repelling, as he now looked at me. The one\r\ndefect that I could discover in his face was at the outer corners of\r\nhis eyes, just under the temple. Here when he laughed, and in a lesser\r\ndegree when he smiled, the skin contracted into quaint little wrinkles\r\nand folds, which looked strangely out of harmony with the almost\r\nyouthful appearance of the rest of his face. As to his other features,\r\nthe mouth, so far as his beard and mustache permitted me to see it, was\r\nsmall and delicately formed; the nose--perfectly shaped on the straight\r\nGrecian model--was perhaps a little too thin, judged by comparison with\r\nthe full cheeks and the high massive forehead. Looking at him as a whole\r\n(and speaking of him, of course, from a woman\'s, not a physiognomist\'s\r\npoint of view), I can only describe him as being an unusually handsome\r\nman. A painter would have reveled in him as a model for St. John. And a\r\nyoung girl, ignorant of what the Oriental robe hid from view, would have\r\nsaid to herself, the instant she looked at him, "Here is the hero of my\r\ndreams!"\r\n\r\nHis blue eyes--large as the eyes of a woman, clear as the eyes of a\r\nchild--rested on me the moment I turned toward him, with a strangely\r\nvarying play of expression, which at once interested and perplexed me.\r\n\r\nNow there was doubt--uneasy, painful doubt--in the look; and now again\r\nit changed brightly to approval, so open and unrestrained that a vain\r\nwoman might have fancied she had made a conquest of him at first sight.\r\nSuddenly a new emotion seemed to take possession of him. His eyes sank,\r\nhis head drooped; he lifted his hands with a gesture of regret. He\r\nmuttered and murmured to himself; pursuing some secret and melancholy\r\ntrain of thought, which seemed to lead him further and further away\r\nfrom present objects of interest, and to plunge him deeper and deeper in\r\ntroubled recollections of the past. Here and there I caught some of the\r\nwords. Little by little I found myself trying to fathom what was darkly\r\npassing in this strange man\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"A far more charming face," I heard him say. "But no--not a more\r\nbeautiful figure. What figure was ever more beautiful than hers?\r\nSomething--but not all--of her enchanting grace. Where is the\r\nresemblance which has brought her back to me? In the pose of the figure,\r\nperhaps. In the movement of the figure, perhaps. Poor martyred angel!\r\nWhat a life! And what a death! what a death!"\r\n\r\nWas he comparing me with the victim of the poison--with my husband\'s\r\nfirst wife? His words seemed to justify the conclusion. If I were right,\r\nthe dead woman had evidently been a favorite with him. There was no\r\nmisinterpreting the broken tones of his voice when he spoke of her: he\r\nhad admired her, living; he mourned her, dead. Supposing that I\r\ncould prevail upon myself to admit this extraordinary person into my\r\nconfidence, what would be the result? Should I be the gainer or the\r\nloser by the resemblance which he fancied he had discovered? Would the\r\nsight of me console him or pain him? I waited eagerly to hear more on\r\nthe subject of the first wife. Not a word more escaped his lips. A new\r\nchange came over him. He lifted his head with a start, and looked about\r\nhim as a weary man might look if he was suddenly disturbed in a deep\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n"What have I done?" he said. "Have I been letting my mind drift again?"\r\nHe shuddered and sighed. "Oh, that house of Gleninch!" he murmured,\r\nsadly, to himself. "Shall I never get away from it in my thoughts? Oh,\r\nthat house of Gleninch!"\r\n\r\nTo my infinite disappointment, Mrs. Macallan checked the further\r\nrevelation of what was passing in his mind.\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone and manner of his allusion to her son\'s\r\ncountry-house seemed to have offended her. She interposed sharply and\r\ndecisively.\r\n\r\n"Gently, my friend, gently!" she said. "I don\'t think you quite know\r\nwhat you are talking about."\r\n\r\nHis great blue eyes flashed at her fiercely. With one turn of his hand\r\nhe brought his chair close at her side. The next instant he caught her\r\nby the arm, and forced her to bend to him, until he could whisper in\r\nher ear. He was violently agitated. His whisper was loud enough to make\r\nitself heard where I was sitting at the time.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I am talking about?" he repeated, with his eyes fixed\r\nattentively, not on my mother-in-law, but on me. "You shortsighted\r\nold woman! where are your spectacles? Look at her! Do you see no\r\nresemblance--the figure, not the face!--do you see no resemblance there\r\nto Eustace\'s first wife?"\r\n\r\n"Pure fancy!" rejoined Mrs. Macallan. "I see nothing of the sort."\r\n\r\nHe shook her impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Not so loud!" he whispered. "She will hear you."\r\n\r\n"I have heard you both," I said. "You need have no fear, Mr. Dexter, of\r\nspeaking before me. I know that my husband had a first wife, and I know\r\nhow miserably she died. I have read the Trial."\r\n\r\n"You have read the life and death of a martyr!" cried Miserrimus Dexter.\r\nHe suddenly wheeled his chair my way; he bent over me; his eyes filled\r\nwith tears. "Nobody appreciated her at her true value," he said, "but\r\nme. Nobody but me! nobody but me!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan walked away impatiently to the end of the room.\r\n\r\n"When you are ready, Valeria, I am," she said. "We cannot keep the\r\nservants and the horses waiting much longer in this bleak place."\r\n\r\nI was too deeply interested in leading Miserrimus Dexter to pursue\r\nthe subject on which he had touched to be willing to leave him at that\r\nmoment. I pretended not to have heard Mrs. Macallan. I laid my hand, as\r\nif by accident, on the wheel-chair to keep him near me.\r\n\r\n"You showed me how highly you esteemed that poor lady in your evidence\r\nat the Trial," I said. "I believe, Mr. Dexter, you have ideas of your\r\nown about the mystery of her death?"\r\n\r\nHe had been looking at my hand, resting on the arm of his chair, until I\r\nventured on my question. At that he suddenly raised his eyes, and fixed\r\nthem with a frowning and furtive suspicion on my face.\r\n\r\n"How do you know I have ideas of my own?" he asked, sternly.\r\n\r\n"I know it from reading the Trial," I answered. "The lawyer who\r\ncross-examined you spoke almost in the very words which I have just\r\nused. I had no intention of offending you, Mr. Dexter."\r\n\r\nHis face cleared as rapidly as it had clouded. He smiled, and laid\r\nhis hand on mine. His touch struck me cold. I felt every nerve in me\r\nshivering under it; I drew my hand away quickly.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," he said, "if I have misunderstood you. I _have_\r\nideas of my own about that unhappy lady." He paused and looked at me in\r\nsilence very earnestly. "Have _you_ any ideas?" he asked. "Ideas about\r\nher life? or about her death?"\r\n\r\nI was deeply interested; I was burning to hear more. It might encourage\r\nhim to speak if I were candid with him. I answered, "Yes."\r\n\r\n"Ideas which you have mentioned to any one?" he went on.\r\n\r\n"To no living creature," I replied--"as yet."\r\n\r\n"This very strange!" he said, still earnestly reading my face. "What\r\ninterest can _you_ have in a dead woman whom you never knew? Why did you\r\nask me that question just now? Have you any motive in coming here to see\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nI boldly acknowledged the truth. I said, "I have a motive."\r\n\r\n"Is it connected with Eustace Macallan\'s first wife?"\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"With anything that happened in her lifetime?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"With her death?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nHe suddenly clasped his hands with a wild gesture of despair, and then\r\npressed them both on his head, as if he were struck by some sudden pain.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t hear it to-night!" he said. "I would give worlds to hear it,\r\nbut I daren\'t. I should lose all hold over myself in the state I am in\r\nnow. I am not equal to raking up the horror and the mystery of the past;\r\nI have not courage enough to open the grave of the martyred dead. Did\r\nyou hear me when you came here? I have an immense imagination. It runs\r\nriot at times. It makes an actor of me. I play the parts of all the\r\nheroes that ever lived. I feel their characters. I merge myself in their\r\nindividualities. For the time I _am_ the man I fancy myself to be. I\r\ncan\'t help it. I am obliged to do it. If I restrained my imagination\r\nwhen the fit is on me, I should go mad. I let myself loose. It lasts\r\nfor hours. It leaves me with my energies worn out, with my sensibilities\r\nfrightfully acute. Rouse any melancholy or terrible associations in me\r\nat such times, and I am capable of hysterics, I am capable of screaming.\r\nYou heard me scream. You shall _not_ see me in hysterics. No, Mrs.\r\nValeria--no, you innocent reflection of the dead and gone--I would not\r\nfrighten you for the world. Will you come here to-morrow in the daytime?\r\nI have got a chaise and a pony. Ariel, my delicate Ariel, can drive. She\r\nshall call at Mamma Macallan\'s and fetch you. We will talk to-morrow,\r\nwhen I am fit for it. I am dying to hear you. I will be fit for you\r\nin the morning. I will be civil, intelligent, communicative, in the\r\nmorning. No more of it now. Away with the subject--the too exciting, the\r\ntoo interesting subject! I must compose myself or my brains will explode\r\nin my head. Music is the true narcotic for excitable brains. My harp! my\r\nharp!"\r\n\r\nHe rushed away in his chair to the far end of the room, passing Mrs.\r\nMacallan as she returned to me, bent on hastening our departure.\r\n\r\n"Come!" said the old lady, irritably. "You have seen him, and he has\r\nmade a good show of himself. More of him might be tiresome. Come away."\r\n\r\nThe chair returned to us more slowly. Miserrimus Dexter was working it\r\nwith one hand only. In the other he held a harp of a pattern which I had\r\nhitherto only seen in pictures. The strings were few in number, and the\r\ninstrument was so small that I could have held it easily on my lap.\r\nIt was the ancient harp of the pictured Muses and the legendary Welsh\r\nbards.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Dexter," said Mrs. Macallan.\r\n\r\nHe held up one hand imperatively.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" he said. "Let her hear me sing." He turned to me. "I decline to\r\nbe indebted to other people for my poetry and my music," he went on. "I\r\ncompose my own poetry and my own music. I improvise. Give me a moment to\r\nthink. I will improvise for You."\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and rested his head on the frame of the harp. His\r\nfingers gently touched the strings while he was thinking. In a\r\nfew minutes he lifted his head, looked at me, and struck the first\r\nnotes--the prelude to the song. It was wild, barbaric, monotonous music,\r\nutterly unlike any modern composition. Sometimes it suggested a slow\r\nand undulating Oriental dance. Sometimes it modulated into tones which\r\nreminded me of the severer harmonies of the old Gregorian chants. The\r\nwords, when they followed the prelude, were as wild, as recklessly free\r\nfrom all restraint of critical rules, as the music. They were assuredly\r\ninspired by the occasion; I was the theme of the strange song. And\r\nthus--in one of the finest tenor voices I ever heard--my poet sang of\r\nme:\r\n\r\n"Why does she come? She reminds me of the lost; She reminds me of the\r\ndead: In her form like the other, In her walk like the other: Why does\r\nshe come?\r\n\r\n"Does Destiny bring her? Shall we range together The mazes of the past?\r\nShall we search together The secrets of the past? Shall we interchange\r\nthoughts, surmises, suspicions? Does Destiny bring her?\r\n\r\n"The Future will show. Let the night pass; Let the day come. I shall see\r\ninto Her mind: She will look into Mine. The Future will show."\r\n\r\nHis voice sank, his fingers touched the strings more and more feebly as\r\nhe approached the last lines. The overwrought brain needed and took its\r\nreanimating repose. At the final words his eyes slowly closed. His head\r\nlay back on the chair. He slept with his arms around his harp, as a\r\nchild sleeps hugging its last new toy.\r\n\r\nWe stole out of the room on tiptoe, and left Miserrimus Dexter--poet,\r\ncomposer, and madman--in his peaceful sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. MORE OF MY OBSTINACY.\r\n\r\nARIEL was downstairs in the shadowy hall, half asleep, half awake,\r\nwaiting to see the visitors clear of the house. Without speaking to us,\r\nwithout looking at us, she led the way down the dark garden walk, and\r\nlocked the gate behind us. "Good-night, Ariel," I called out to her over\r\nthe paling. Nothing answered me but the tramp of her heavy footsteps\r\nreturning to the house, and the dull thump, a moment afterward, of the\r\nclosing door.\r\n\r\nThe footman had thoughtfully lighted the carriage lamps. Carrying one\r\nof them to serve as a lantern, he lighted us over the wilds of the brick\r\ndesert, and landed us safely on the path by the high-road.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said my mother-in-law, when we were comfortably seated in the\r\ncarriage again. "You have seen Miserrimus Dexter, and I hope you are\r\nsatisfied. I will do him the justice to declare that I never, in all my\r\nexperience, saw him more completely crazy than he was to-night. What do\r\n_you_ say?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t presume to dispute your opinion," I answered. "But, speaking\r\nfor myself, I\'m not quite sure that he is mad."\r\n\r\n"Not mad!" cried Mrs. Macallan, "after those frantic performances in his\r\nchair? Not mad, after the exhibition he made of his unfortunate cousin?\r\nNot mad, after the song that he sang in your honor, and the falling\r\nasleep by way of conclusion? Oh, Valeria! Valeria! Well said the wisdom\r\nof our ancestors--there are none so blind as those who won\'t see."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, dear Mrs. Macallan, I saw everything that you mention, and I\r\nnever felt more surprised or more confounded in my life. But now I have\r\nrecovered from my amazement, and can think it over quietly, I must still\r\nventure to doubt whether this strange man is really mad in the true\r\nmeaning of the word. It seems to me that he only expresses--I admit in a\r\nvery reckless and boisterous way--thoughts and feelings which most of\r\nus are ashamed of as weaknesses, and which we keep to ourselves\r\naccordingly. I confess I have often fancied myself transformed into some\r\nother person, and have felt a certain pleasure in seeing myself in my\r\nnew character. One of our first amusements as children (if we have any\r\nimagination at all) is to get out of our own characters, and to try the\r\ncharacters of other personages as a change--to fairies, to be queens, to\r\nbe anything, in short, but what we really are. Mr. Dexter lets out the\r\nsecret just as the children do, and if that is madness, he is certainly\r\nmad. But I noticed that when his imagination cooled down he became\r\nMiserrimus Dexter again--he no more believed himself than we believed\r\nhim to be Napoleon or Shakespeare. Besides, some allowance is surely to\r\nbe made for the solitary, sedentary life that he leads. I am not learned\r\nenough to trace the influence of that life in making him what he is; but\r\nI think I can see the result in an over-excited imagination, and I\r\nfancy I can trace his exhibiting his power over the poor cousin and\r\nhis singing of that wonderful song to no more formidable cause than\r\ninordinate self-conceit. I hope the confession will not lower me\r\nseriously in your good opinion; but I must say I have enjoyed my visit,\r\nand, worse still, Miserrimus Dexter really interests me."\r\n\r\n"Does this learned discourse on Dexter mean that you are going to see\r\nhim again?" asked Mrs. Macallan.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how I may feel about it tomorrow morning," I said; "but\r\nmy impulse at this moment is decidedly to see him again. I had a little\r\ntalk with him while you were away at the other end of the room, and I\r\nbelieve he really can be of use to me--"\r\n\r\n"Of use to you in what?" interposed my mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"In the one object which I have in view--the object, dear Mrs. Macallan,\r\nwhich I regret to say you do not approve."\r\n\r\n"And you are going to take him into your confidence? to open your whole\r\nmind to such a man as the man we have just left?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if I think of it to-morrow as I think of it to-night. I dare\r\nsay it is a risk; but I must run risks. I know I am not prudent; but\r\nprudence won\'t help a woman in my position, with my end to gain."\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan made no further remonstrance in words. She opened a\r\ncapacious pocket in front of the carriage, and took from it a box of\r\nmatches and a railway reading-lamp.\r\n\r\n"You provoke me," said the old lady, "into showing you what your husband\r\nthinks of this new whim of yours. I have got his letter with me--his\r\nlast letter from Spain. You shall judge for yourself, you poor deluded\r\nyoung creature, whether my son is worthy of the sacrifice--the useless\r\nand hopeless sacrifice--which you are bent on making of yourself for his\r\nsake. Strike a light!"\r\n\r\nI willingly obeyed her. Ever since she had informed me of Eustace\'s\r\ndeparture to Spain I had been eager for more news of him, for something\r\nto sustain my spirits, after so much that had disappointed and depressed\r\nme. Thus far I did not even know whether my husband thought of me\r\nsometimes in his self-imposed exile. As to this regretting already the\r\nrash act which had separated us, it was still too soon to begin hoping\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\nThe lamp having been lighted, and fixed in its place between the two\r\nfront windows of the carriage, Mrs. Macallan produced her son\'s letter.\r\nThere is no folly like the folly of love. It cost me a hard struggle\r\nto restrain myself from kissing the paper on which the dear hand had\r\nrested.\r\n\r\n"There!" said my mother-in-law. "Begin on the second page, the page\r\ndevoted to you. Read straight down to the last line at the bottom, and,\r\nin God\'s name, come back to your senses, child, before it is too late!"\r\n\r\nI followed my instructions, and read these words:\r\n\r\n"Can I trust myself to write of Valeria? I _must_ write of her. Tell me\r\nhow she is, how she looks, what she is doing. I am always thinking of\r\nher. Not a day passes but I mourn the loss of her. Oh, if she had only\r\nbeen contented to let matters rest as they were! Oh, if she had never\r\ndiscovered the miserable truth!\r\n\r\n"She spoke of reading the Trial when I saw her last. Has she persisted\r\nin doing so? I believe--I say this seriously, mother--I believe the\r\nshame and the horror of it would have been the death of me if I had\r\nmet her face to face when she first knew of the ignominy that I have\r\nsuffered, of the infamous suspicion of which I have been publicly made\r\nthe subject. Think of those pure eyes looking at a man who has been\r\naccused (and never wholly absolved) of the foulest and the vilest of\r\nall murders, and then think of what that man must feel if he have any\r\nheart and any sense of shame left in him. I sicken as I write of it.\r\n\r\n"Does she still meditate that hopeless project--the offspring, poor\r\nangel, of her artless, unthinking generosity? Does she still fancy that\r\nit is in _her_ power to assert my innocence before the world? Oh, mother\r\n(if she do), use your utmost influence to make her give up the idea!\r\nSpare her the humiliation, the disappointment, the insult, perhaps,\r\nto which she may innocently expose herself. For her sake, for my sake,\r\nleave no means untried to attain this righteous, this merciful end.\r\n\r\n"I send her no message--I dare not do it. Say nothing, when you see her,\r\nwhich can recall me to her memory. On the contrary, help her to forget\r\nme as soon as possible. The kindest thing I can do--the one atonement I\r\ncan make to her--is to drop out of her life."\r\n\r\nWith those wretched words it ended. I handed his letter back to his\r\nmother in silence. She said but little on her side.\r\n\r\n"If _this_ doesn\'t discourage you," she remarked, slowly folding up the\r\nletter, "nothing will. Let us leave it there, and say no more."\r\n\r\nI made no answer--I was crying behind my veil. My domestic prospect\r\nlooked so dreary! my unfortunate husband was so hopelessly misguided, so\r\npitiably wrong! The one chance for both of us, and the one consolation\r\nfor poor Me, was to hold to my desperate resolution more firmly than\r\never. If I had wanted anything to confirm me in this view, and to arm me\r\nagainst the remonstrances of every one of my friends, Eustace\'s letter\r\nwould have proved more than sufficient to answer the purpose. At least\r\nhe had not forgotten me; he thought of me, and he mourned the loss of me\r\nevery day of his life. That was encouragement enough--for the present.\r\n"If Ariel calls for me in the pony-chaise to-morrow," I thought to\r\nmyself, "with Ariel I go."\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan set me down at Benjamin\'s door.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to her at parting--I stood sufficiently in awe of her to put\r\nit off till the last moment--that Miserrimus Dexter had arranged to send\r\nhis cousin and his pony-chaise to her residence on the next day; and I\r\ninquired thereupon whether my mother-in-law would permit me to call at\r\nher house to wait for the appearance of the cousin, or whether she would\r\nprefer sending the chaise on to Benjamin\'s cottage. I fully expected an\r\nexplosion of anger to follow this bold avowal of my plans for the next\r\nday. The old lady agreeably surprised me. She proved that she had really\r\ntaken a liking to me: she kept her temper.\r\n\r\n"If you persist in going back to Dexter, you certainly shall not go to\r\nhim from my door," she said. "But I hope you will _not_ persist. I hope\r\nyou will awake a wiser woman to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nThe morning came. A little before noon the arrival of the pony-chaise\r\nwas announced at the door, and a letter was brought in to me from Mrs.\r\nMacallan.\r\n\r\n"I have no right to control your movements," my mother-in-law wrote. "I\r\nsend the chaise to Mr. Benjamin\'s house; and I sincerely trust that you\r\nwill not take your place in it. I wish I could persuade you, Valeria,\r\nhow truly I am your friend. I have been thinking about you anxiously\r\nin the wakeful hours of the night. _How_ anxiously, you will understand\r\nwhen I tell you that I now reproach myself for not having done more than\r\nI did to prevent your unhappy marriage. And yet, what more I could have\r\ndone I don\'t really know. My son admitted to me that he was courting you\r\nunder an assumed name, but he never told me what the name was. Or who\r\nyou were, or where your friends lived. Perhaps I ought to have taken\r\nmeasures to find this out. Perhaps, if I had succeeded, I ought to have\r\ninterfered and enlightened you, even at the sad sacrifice of making an\r\nenemy of my own son. I honestly thought I did my duty in expressing my\r\ndisapproval, and in refusing to be present at the marriage. Was I too\r\neasily satisfied? It is too late to ask. Why do I trouble you with an\r\nold woman\'s vain misgivings and regrets? My child, if you come to any\r\nharm, I shall feel (indirectly) responsible for it. It is this uneasy\r\nstate of mind which sets me writing, with nothing to say that can\r\ninterest you. Don\'t go to Dexter! The fear has been pursuing me all\r\nnight that your going to Dexter will end badly. Write him an excuse.\r\nValeria! I firmly believe you will repent it if you return to that\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nWas ever a woman more plainly warned, more carefully advised, than I?\r\nAnd yet warning and advice were both thrown away on me.\r\n\r\nLet me say for myself that I was really touched by the kindness of my\r\nmother-in-law\'s letter, though I was not shaken by it in the smallest\r\ndegree. As long as I lived, moved, and thought, my one purpose now was\r\nto make Miserrimus Dexter confide to me his ideas on the subject of Mrs.\r\nEustace Macallan\'s death. To those ideas I looked as my guiding stars\r\nalong the dark way on which I was going. I wrote back to Mrs. Macallan,\r\nas I really felt gratefully and penitently. And then I went out to the\r\nchaise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. MR. DEXTER AT HOME.\r\n\r\nI FOUND all the idle boys in the neighborhood collected around the\r\npony-chaise, expressing, in the occult language of slang, their high\r\nenjoyment and appreciation at the appearance of "Ariel" in her man\'s\r\njacket and hat. The pony was fidgety--_he_ felt the influence of the\r\npopular uproar. His driver sat, whip in hand, magnificently\r\nimpenetrable to the gibes and jests that were flying around her. I said\r\n"Good-morning" on getting into the chaise. Ariel only said "Gee up!" and\r\nstarted the pony.\r\n\r\nI made up my mind to perform the journey to the distant northern suburb\r\nin silence. It was evidently useless for me to attempt to speak, and\r\nexperience informed me that I need not expect to hear a word fall from\r\nthe lips of my companion. Experience, however, is not always infallible.\r\nAfter driving for half an hour in stolid silence, Ariel astounded me by\r\nsuddenly bursting into speech.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what we are coming to?" she asked, keeping her eyes\r\nstraight between the pony\'s ears.\r\n\r\n"No," I answered. "I don\'t know the road. What are we coming to?"\r\n\r\n"We are coming to a canal."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I have half a mind to upset you in the canal."\r\n\r\nThis formidable announcement appeared to require some explanation. I\r\ntook the liberty of asking for it.\r\n\r\n"Why should you upset me?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Because I hate you," was the cool and candid reply.\r\n\r\n"What have I done to offend you?" I asked next.\r\n\r\n"What do you want with the Master?" Ariel asked, in her turn.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean Mr. Dexter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I want to have some talk with Mr. Dexter."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t! You want to take my place. You want to brush his hair and\r\noil his beard, instead of me. You wretch!"\r\n\r\nI now began to understand. The idea which Miserrimus Dexter had\r\njestingly put into her head, in exhibiting her to us on the previous\r\nnight, had been ripening slowly in that dull brain, and had found\r\nits way outward into words, about fifteen hours afterward, under the\r\nirritating influence of my presence!\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to touch his hair or his beard," I said. "I leave that\r\nentirely to you."\r\n\r\nShe looked around at me, her fat face flushing, her dull eyes dilating,\r\nwith the unaccustomed effort to express herself in speech, and to\r\nunderstand what was said to her in return.\r\n\r\n"Say that again," she burst out. "And say it slower this time."\r\n\r\nI said it again, and I said it slower.\r\n\r\n"Swear it!" she cried, getting more and more excited.\r\n\r\nI preserved my gravity (the canal was just visible in the distance), and\r\nswore it.\r\n\r\n"Are you satisfied now?" I asked.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. Her last resources of speech were exhausted. The\r\nstrange creature looked back again straight between the pony\'s ears,\r\nemitted hoarsely a grunt of relief, and never more looked at me, never\r\nmore spoke to me, for the rest of the journey. We drove past the banks\r\nof the canal, and I escaped immersion. We rattled, in our jingling\r\nlittle vehicle, through the streets and across the waste patches of\r\nground, which I dimly remembered in the darkness, and which looked more\r\nsqualid and more hideous than ever in the broad daylight. The chaise\r\nturned down a lane, too narrow for the passage of any larger vehicle, and\r\nstopped at a wall and a gate that were new objects to me. Opening the\r\ngate with her key, and leading the pony, Ariel introduced me to the back\r\ngarden and yard of Miserrimus Dexter\'s rotten and rambling old house.\r\nThe pony walked off independently to his stable, with the chaise behind\r\nhim. My silent companion led me through a bleak and barren kitchen, and\r\nalong a stone passage. Opening a door at the end, she admitted me to the\r\nback of the hall, into which Mrs. Macallan and I had penetrated by the\r\nfront entrance to the house. Here Ariel lifted a whistle which hung\r\naround her neck, and blew the shrill trilling notes with the sound\r\nof which I was already familiar as the means of communication between\r\nMiserrimus Dexter and his slave. The whistling over, the slave\'s\r\nunwilling lips struggled into speech for the last time.\r\n\r\n"Wait till you hear the Master\'s whistle," she said; "then go upstairs."\r\n\r\nSo! I was to be whistled for like a dog! And, worse still, there was\r\nno help for it but to submit like a dog. Had Ariel any excuses to make?\r\nNothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nShe turned her shapeless back on me and vanished into the kitchen region\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for a minute or two, and hearing no signal from the floor\r\nabove, I advanced into the broader and brighter part of the hall, to\r\nlook by daylight at the pictures which I had only imperfectly discovered\r\nin the darkness of the night. A painted inscription in many colors,\r\njust under the cornice of the ceiling, informed me that the works on the\r\nwalls were the production of the all-accomplished Dexter himself. Not\r\nsatisfied with being poet and composer, he was painter as well. On one\r\nwall the subjects were described as "Illustrations of the Passions;"\r\non the other, as "Episodes in the Life of the Wandering Jew."\r\nChance speculators like myself were gravely warned, by means of the\r\ninscription, to view the pictures as efforts of pure imagination.\r\n"Persons who look for mere Nature in works of Art" (the inscription\r\nannounced) "are persons to whom Mr. Dexter does not address himself with\r\nthe brush. He relies entirely on his imagination. Nature puts him out."\r\n\r\nTaking due care to dismiss all ideas of Nature from my mind, to begin\r\nwith, I looked at the pictures which represented the Passions first.\r\n\r\nLittle as I knew critically of Art, I could see that Miserrimus Dexter\r\nknew still less of the rules of drawing, color, and composition. His\r\npictures were, in the strictest meaning of that expressive word, Daubs.\r\nThe diseased and riotous delight of the painter in representing\r\nHorrors was (with certain exceptions to be hereafter mentioned) the one\r\nremarkable quality that I could discover in the series of his works.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Passion pictures illustrated Revenge. A corpse, in\r\nfancy costume, lay on the bank of a foaming river, under the shade of a\r\ngiant tree. An infuriated man, also in fancy costume, stood astride over\r\nthe dead body, with his sword lifted to the lowering sky, and watched,\r\nwith a horrid expression of delight, the blood of the man whom he had\r\njust killed dripping slowly in a procession of big red drops down the\r\nbroad blade of his weapon. The next picture illustrated Cruelty, in many\r\ncompartments. In one I saw a disemboweled horse savagely spurred on\r\nby his rider at a bull-fight. In another, an aged philosopher was\r\ndissecting a living cat, and gloating over his work. In a third, two\r\npagans politely congratulated each other on the torture of two saints:\r\none saint was roasting on a grid-iron; the other, hung up to a tree by\r\nhis heels, had been just skinned, and was not quite dead yet. Feeling\r\nno great desire, after these specimens, to look at any more of the\r\nillustrated Passions, I turned to the opposite wall to be instructed in\r\nthe career of the Wandering Jew. Here a second inscription informed me\r\nthat the painter considered the Flying Dutchman to be no other than\r\nthe Wandering Jew, pursuing his interminable Journey by sea. The marine\r\nadventures of this mysterious personage were the adventures chosen for\r\nrepresentation by Dexter\'s brush. The first picture showed me a harbor\r\non a rocky coast. A vessel was at anchor, with the helmsman singing on\r\nthe deck. The sea in the offing was black and rolling; thunder-clouds\r\nlay low on the horizon, split by broad flashes of lightning. In the\r\nglare of the lightning, heaving and pitching, appeared the misty form\r\nof the Phantom Ship approaching the shore. In this work, badly as it was\r\npainted, there were really signs of a powerful imagination, and even\r\nof a poetical feeling for the supernatural. The next picture showed the\r\nPhantom Ship, moored (to the horror and astonishment of the helmsman)\r\nbehind the earthly vessel in the harbor. The Jew had stepped on shore.\r\nHis boat was on the beach. His crew--little men with stony, white faces,\r\ndressed in funeral black--sat in silent rows on the seats of the boat,\r\nwith their oars in their lean, long hands. The Jew, also a black, stood\r\nwith his eyes and hands raised imploringly to the thunderous heaven.\r\nThe wild creatures of land and sea--the tiger, the rhinoceros, the\r\ncrocodile, the sea-serpent, the shark, and the devil-fish--surrounded\r\nthe accursed Wanderer in a mystic circle, daunted and fascinated at the\r\nsight of him. The lightning was gone. The sky and sea had darkened to\r\na great black blank. A faint and lurid light lighted the scene, falling\r\ndownward from a torch, brandished by an avenging Spirit that hovered\r\nover the Jew on outspread vulture wings. Wild as the picture might be\r\nin its conception, there was a suggestive power in it which I confess\r\nstrongly impressed me. The mysterious silence in the house, and my\r\nstrange position at the moment, no doubt had their effect on my mind.\r\nWhile I was still looking at the ghastly composition before me, the\r\nshrill trilling sound of the whistle upstairs burst on the stillness.\r\nFor the moment my nerves were so completely upset that I started with a\r\ncry of alarm. I felt a momentary impulse to open the door and run out.\r\nThe idea of trusting myself alone with the man who had painted those\r\nfrightful pictures actually terrified me; I was obliged to sit down on\r\none of the hall chairs. Some minutes passed before my mind recovered\r\nits balance, and I began to feel like my own ordinary self again. The\r\nwhistle sounded impatiently for the second time. I rose and ascended the\r\nbroad flight of stairs which led to the first story. To draw back at the\r\npoint which I had now reached would have utterly degraded me in my own\r\nestimation. Still, my heart did certainly beat faster than usual as I\r\napproached the door of the circular anteroom; and I honestly acknowledge\r\nthat I saw my own imprudence, just then, in a singularly vivid light.\r\n\r\nThere was a glass over the mantel-piece in the anteroom. I lingered for\r\na moment (nervous as I was) to see how I looked in the glass.\r\n\r\nThe hanging tapestry over the inner door had been left partially drawn\r\naside. Softly as I moved, the dog\'s ears of Miserrimus Dexter caught the\r\nsound of my dress on the floor. The fine tenor voice, which I had last\r\nheard singing, called to me softly.\r\n\r\n"Is that Mrs. Valeria? Please don\'t wait there. Come in!"\r\n\r\nI entered the inner room.\r\n\r\nThe wheeled chair advanced to meet me, so slowly and so softly that I\r\nhardly knew it again. Miserrimus Dexter languidly held out his hand. His\r\nhead inclined pensively to one side; his large blue eyes looked at\r\nme piteously. Not a vestige seemed to be left of the raging, shouting\r\ncreature of my first visit, who was Napoleon at one moment, and\r\nShakespeare at another. Mr. Dexter of the morning was a mild,\r\nthoughtful, melancholy man, who only recalled Mr. Dexter of the night by\r\nthe inveterate oddity of his dress. His jacket, on this occasion, was\r\nof pink quilted silk. The coverlet which hid his deformity matched the\r\njacket in pale sea-green satin; and, to complete these strange vagaries\r\nof costume, his wrists were actually adorned with massive bracelets of\r\ngold, formed on the severely simple models which have descended to us\r\nfrom ancient times.\r\n\r\n"How good of you to cheer and charm me by coming here!" he said, in his\r\nmost mournful and most musical tones. "I have dressed, expressly to\r\nreceive you, in the prettiest clothes I have. Don\'t be surprised. Except\r\nin this ignoble and material nineteenth century, men have always worn\r\nprecious stuffs and beautiful colors as well as women. A hundred years\r\nago a gentleman in pink silk was a gentleman properly dressed. Fifteen\r\nhundred years ago the patricians of the classic times wore bracelets\r\nexactly like mine. I despise the brutish contempt for beauty and the\r\nmean dread of expense which degrade a gentleman\'s costume to black\r\ncloth, and limit a gentleman\'s ornaments to a finger-ring, in the age I\r\nlive in. I like to be bright and I beautiful, especially when brightness\r\nand beauty come to see me. You don\'t know how precious your society\r\nis to me. This is one of my melancholy days. Tears rise unbidden to my\r\neyes. I sigh and sorrow over myself; I languish for pity. Just think of\r\nwhat I am! A poor solitary creature, cursed with a frightful deformity.\r\nHow pitiable! how dreadful! My affectionate heart--wasted. My\r\nextraordinary talents--useless or misapplied. Sad! sad! sad! Please pity\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHis eyes were positively filled with tears--tears of compassion for\r\nhimself! He looked at me and spoke to me with the wailing, querulous\r\nentreaty of a sick child wanting to be nursed. I was utterly at a\r\nloss what to do. It was perfectly ridiculous--but I was never more\r\nembarrassed in my life.\r\n\r\n"Please pity me!" he repeated. "Don\'t be cruel. I only ask a little\r\nthing. Pretty Mrs. Valeria, say you pity me!"\r\n\r\nI said I pitied him--and I felt that I blushed as I did it.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Miserrimus Dexter, humbly. "It does me good. Go a\r\nlittle further. Pat my hand."\r\n\r\nI tried to restrain myself; but the sense of the absurdity of this last\r\npetition (quite gravely addressed to me, remember!) was too strong to be\r\ncontrolled. I burst out laughing.\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter looked at me with a blank astonishment which only\r\nincreased my merriment. Had I offended him? Apparently not. Recovering\r\nfrom his astonishment, he laid his head luxuriously on the back of his\r\nchair, with the expression of a man who was listening critically to a\r\nperformance of some sort. When I had quite exhausted myself, he raised\r\nhis head and clapped his shapely white hands, and honored me with an\r\n"encore."\r\n\r\n"Do it again," he said, still in the same childish way. "Merry Mrs.\r\nValeria, _you_ have a musical laugh--_I_ have a musical ear. Do it\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nI was serious enough by this time. "I am ashamed of myself, Mr. Dexter,"\r\nI said. "Pray forgive me."\r\n\r\nHe made no answer to this; I doubt if he heard me. His variable temper\r\nappeared to be in course of undergoing some new change. He sat looking\r\nat my dress (as I supposed) with a steady and anxious attention, gravely\r\nforming his own conclusions, steadfastly pursuing his own train of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Valeria," he burst out suddenly, "you are not comfortable in that\r\nchair."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," I replied; "I am quite comfortable."\r\n\r\n"Pardon _me,_" he rejoined. "There is a chair of Indian basket-work at\r\nthat end of the room which is much better suited to you. Will you accept\r\nmy apologies if I am rude enough to allow you to fetch it for yourself?\r\nI have a reason."\r\n\r\nHe had a reason! What new piece of eccentricity was he about to exhibit?\r\nI rose and fetched the chair. It was light enough to be quite easily\r\ncarried. As I returned to him, I noticed that his eyes were strangely\r\nemployed in what seemed to be the closest scrutiny of my dress. And,\r\nstranger still, the result of this appeared to be partly to interest and\r\npartly to distress him.\r\n\r\nI placed the chair near him, and was about to take my seat in it, when\r\nhe sent me back again, on another errand, to the end of the room.\r\n\r\n"Oblige me indescribably," he said. "There is a hand-screen hanging on\r\nthe wall, which matches the chair. We are rather near the fire here. You\r\nmay find the screen useful. Once more forgive me for letting you fetch\r\nit for yourself. Once more let me assure you that I have a reason."\r\n\r\nHere was his "reason," reiterated, emphatically reiterated, for the\r\nsecond time! Curiosity made me as completely the obedient servant of his\r\ncaprices as Ariel herself. I fetched the hand-screen. Returning with it,\r\nI met his eyes still fixed with the same incomprehensible attention on\r\nmy perfectly plain and unpretending dress, and still expressing the same\r\ncurious mixture of interest and regret.\r\n\r\n"Thank you a thousand times," he said. "You have (quite innocently)\r\nwrung my heart. But you have not the less done me an inestimable\r\nkindness. Will you promise not to be offended with me if I confess the\r\ntruth?"\r\n\r\nHe was approaching his explanation I never gave a promise more readily\r\nin my life.\r\n\r\n"I have rudely allowed you to fetch your chair and your screen for\r\nyourself," he went on. "My motive will seem a very strange one, I\r\nam afraid. Did you observe that I noticed you very attentively--too\r\nattentively, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "I thought you were noticing my dress."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and sighed bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Not your dress," he said; "and not your face. Your dress is dark. Your\r\nface is still strange to me. Dear Mrs. Valeria, I wanted to see you\r\nwalk."\r\n\r\nTo see me walk! What did he mean? Where was that erratic mind of his\r\nwandering to now?\r\n\r\n"You have a rare accomplishment for an Englishwoman," he resumed--"you\r\nwalk well. _She_ walked well. I couldn\'t resist the temptation of seeing\r\nher again, in seeing you. It was _her_ movement, _her_ sweet, simple,\r\nunsought grace (not yours), when you walked to the end of the room and\r\nreturned to me. You raised her from the dead when you fetched the chair\r\nand the screen. Pardon me for making use of you: the idea was innocent,\r\nthe motive was sacred. You have distressed--and delighted me. My heart\r\nbleeds--and thanks you."\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment; he let his head droop on his breast, then\r\nsuddenly raised it again.\r\n\r\n"Surely we were talking about her last night?" he said. "What did I say?\r\nwhat did you say? My memory is confused; I half remember, half forget.\r\nPlease remind me. You\'re not offended with me--are you?"\r\n\r\nI might have been offended with another man. Not with him. I was far too\r\nanxious to find my way into his confidence--now that he had touched of\r\nhis own accord on the subject of Eustace\'s first wife--to be offended\r\nwith Miserrimus Dexter.\r\n\r\n"We were speaking," I answered, "of Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s death, and\r\nwe were saying to one another--"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted me, leaning forward eagerly in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Yes! yes!" he exclaimed. "And I was wondering what interest _you_ could\r\nhave in penetrating the mystery of her death. Tell me! Confide in me! I\r\nam dying to know!"\r\n\r\n"Not even you have a stronger interest in that subject than the interest\r\nthat I feel," I said. "The happiness of my whole life to come depends on\r\nmy clearing up the mystery."\r\n\r\n"Good God--why?" he cried. "Stop! I am exciting myself. I mustn\'t do\r\nthat. I must have all my wits about me; I mustn\'t wander. The thing is\r\ntoo serious. Wait a minute!"\r\n\r\nAn elegant little basket was hooked on to one of the arms of his chair.\r\nHe opened it, and drew out a strip of embroidery partially finished,\r\nwith the necessary materials for working, a complete. We looked at each\r\nother across the embroidery. He noticed my surprise.\r\n\r\n"Women," he said, "wisely compose their minds, and help themselves to\r\nthink quietly, by doing needle-work. Why are men such fools as to\r\ndeny themselves the same admirable resource--the simple and soothing\r\noccupation which keeps the nerves steady and leaves the mind calm and\r\nfree? As a man, I follow the woman\'s wise example. Mrs. Valeria, permit\r\nme to compose myself."\r\n\r\nGravely arranging his embroidery, this extraordinary being began to work\r\nwith the patient and nimble dexterity of an accomplished needle-woman.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Miserrimus Dexter, "if you are ready, I am. You talk--I\r\nwork. Please begin."\r\n\r\nI obeyed him, and began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. IN THE DARK.\r\n\r\nWITH such a man as Miserrimus Dexter, and with such a purpose as I had\r\nin view, no half-confidences were possible. I must either risk the most\r\nunreserved acknowledgment of the interests that I really had at stake,\r\nor I must make the best excuse that occurred to me for abandoning my\r\ncontemplated experiment at the last moment. In my present critical\r\nsituation, no such refuge as a middle course lay before me--even if I\r\nhad been inclined to take it. As things were, I ran risks, and plunged\r\nheadlong into my own affairs at starting.\r\n\r\n"Thus far, you know little or nothing about me, Mr. Dexter," I said.\r\n"You are, as I believe, quite unaware that my husband and I are not\r\nliving together at the present time."\r\n\r\n"Is it necessary to mention your husband?" he asked, coldly, without\r\nlooking up from his embroidery, and without pausing in his work.\r\n\r\n"It is absolutely necessary," I answered. "I can explain myself to you\r\nin no other way."\r\n\r\nHe bent his head, and sighed resignedly.\r\n\r\n"You and your husband are not living together at the present time," he\r\nresumed. "Does that mean that Eustace has left you?"\r\n\r\n"He has left me, and has gone abroad."\r\n\r\n"Without any necessity for it?"\r\n\r\n"Without the least necessity."\r\n\r\n"Has he appointed no time for his return to you?"\r\n\r\n"If he persevere in his present resolution, Mr. Dexter, Eustace will\r\nnever return to me."\r\n\r\nFor the first time he raised his head from his embroidery--with a sudden\r\nappearance of interest.\r\n\r\n"Is the quarrel so serious as that?" he asked. "Are you free of each\r\nother, pretty Mrs. Valeria, by common consent of both parties?"\r\n\r\nThe tone in which he put the question was not at all to my liking. The\r\nlook he fixed on me was a look which unpleasantly suggested that I had\r\ntrusted myself alone with him, and that he might end in taking advantage\r\nof it. I reminded him quietly, by my manner more than by my words, of\r\nthe respect which he owed to me.\r\n\r\n"You are entirely mistaken," I said. "There is no anger--there is not\r\neven a misunderstanding between us. Our parting has cost bitter sorrow,\r\nMr. Dexter, to him and to me."\r\n\r\nHe submitted to be set right with ironical resignation. "I am all\r\nattention," he said, threading his needle. "Pray go on; I won\'t\r\ninterrupt you again." Acting on this invitation, I told him the truth\r\nabout my husband and myself quite unreservedly, taking care, however,\r\nat the same time, to put Eustace\'s motives in the best light that they\r\nwould bear. Miserrimus Dexter dropped his embroidery on his lap, and\r\nlaughed softly to himself, with an impish enjoyment of my poor little\r\nnarrative, which set every nerve in me on edge as I looked at him.\r\n\r\n"I see nothing to laugh at," I said, sharply.\r\n\r\nHis beautiful blue eyes rested on me with a look of innocent surprise.\r\n\r\n"Nothing to laugh at," he repeated, "in such an exhibition of human\r\nfolly as you have just described?" His expression suddenly changed his\r\nface darkened and hardened very strangely. "Stop!" he cried, before I\r\ncould answer him. "There can be only one reason for you\'re taking it as\r\nseriously as you do. Mrs. Valeria! you are fond of your husband."\r\n\r\n"Fond of him isn\'t strong enough to express it," I retorted. "I love him\r\nwith my whole heart."\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter stroked his magnificent beard, and contemplatively\r\nrepeated my words. "You love him with your whole heart? Do you know\r\nwhy?"\r\n\r\n"Because I can\'t help it," I answered, doggedly.\r\n\r\nHe smiled satirically, and went on with his embroidery. "Curious!" he\r\nsaid to himself; "Eustace\'s first wife loved him too. There are some men\r\nwhom the women all like, and there are other men whom the women never\r\ncare for. Without the least reason for it in either case. The one man is\r\njust as good as the other; just as handsome, as agreeable, as honorable,\r\nand as high in rank as the other. And yet for Number One they will go\r\nthrough fire and water, and for Number Two they won\'t so much as turn\r\ntheir heads to look at him. Why? They don\'t know themselves--as Mrs.\r\nValeria has just said! Is there a physical reason for it? Is there\r\nsome potent magnetic emanation from Number One which Number Two doesn\'t\r\npossess? I must investigate this when I have the time, and when I find\r\nmyself in the humor." Having so far settled the question to his own\r\nentire satisfaction, he looked up at me again. "I am still in the dark\r\nabout you and your motives," he said. "I am still as far as ever from\r\nunderstanding what your interest is in investigating that hideous\r\ntragedy at Gleninch. Clever Mrs. Valeria, please take me by the hand,\r\nand lead me into the light. You\'re not offended with me are you? Make it\r\nup; and I will give you this pretty piece of embroidery when I have done\r\nit. I am only a poor, solitary, deformed wretch, with a quaint turn of\r\nmind; I mean no harm. Forgive me! indulge me! enlighten me!"\r\n\r\nHe resumed his childish ways; he recover, his innocent smile, with the\r\nodd little puckers and wrinkles accompanying it at the corners of his\r\neyes. I began to doubt whether I might not have been unreasonably\r\nhard on him. I penitently resolved to be more considerate toward his\r\ninfirmities of mind and body during the remainder of my visit.\r\n\r\n"Let me go back for a moment, Mr. Dexter, to past times at Gleninch," I\r\nsaid. "You agree with me in believing Eustace to be absolutely innocent\r\nof the crime for which he was tried. Your evidence at the Trial tells me\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nHe paused over his work, and looked at me with a grave and stern\r\nattention which presented his face in quite a new light.\r\n\r\n"That is _our_ opinion," I resumed. "But it was not the opinion of the\r\nJury. Their verdict, you remember, was Not Proven. In plain English, the\r\nJury who tried my husband declined to express their opinion, positively\r\nand publicly, that he was innocent. Am I right?"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, he suddenly put his embroidery back in the basket,\r\nand moved the machinery of his chair, so as to bring it close by mine.\r\n\r\n"Who told you this?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I found it for myself in a book."\r\n\r\nThus far his face had expressed steady attention--and no more. Now, for\r\nthe first time, I thought I saw something darkly passing over him which\r\nbetrayed itself to my mind as rising distrust.\r\n\r\n"Ladies are not generally in the habit of troubling their heads about\r\ndry questions of law," he said. "Mrs. Eustace Macallan the Second, you\r\nmust have some very powerful motive for turning your studies that way."\r\n\r\n"I have a very powerful motive, Mr. Dexter My husband is resigned to the\r\nScotch Verdict His mother is resigned to it. His friends (so far as I\r\nknow) are resigned to it--"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well! I don\'t agree with my husband, or his mother, or his friends. I\r\nrefuse to submit to the Scotch Verdict."\r\n\r\nThe instant I said those words, the madness in him which I had hitherto\r\ndenied, seemed to break out. He suddenly stretched himself over his\r\nchair: he pounced on me, with a hand on each of my shoulders; his wild\r\neyes questioned me fiercely, frantically, within a few inches of my\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" he shouted, at the utmost pitch of his ringing and\r\nresonant voice.\r\n\r\nA deadly fear of him shook me. I did my best to hide the outward\r\nbetrayal of it. By look and word, I showed him, as firmly as I could,\r\nthat I resented the liberty he had taken with me.\r\n\r\n"Remove your hands, sir," I said, "and retire to your proper place."\r\n\r\nHe obeyed me mechanically. He apologized to me mechanically. His whole\r\nmind was evidently still filled with the words that I had spoken to him,\r\nand still bent on discovering what those words meant.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," he said; "I humbly beg your pardon. The subject\r\nexcites me, frightens me, maddens me. You don\'t know what a difficulty\r\nI have in controlling myself. Never mind. Don\'t take me seriously. Don\'t\r\nbe frightened at me. I am so ashamed of myself--I feel so small and so\r\nmiserable at having offended you. Make me suffer for it. Take a stick\r\nand beat me. Tie me down in my chair. Call up Ariel, who is as strong\r\nas a horse, and tell her to hold me. Dear Mrs. Valeria! Injured Mrs.\r\nValeria! I\'ll endure anything in the way of punishment, if you will\r\nonly tell me what you mean by not submitting to the Scotch Verdict." He\r\nbacked his chair penitently as he made that entreaty. "Am I far enough\r\naway yet?" he asked, with a rueful look. "Do I still frighten you? I\'ll\r\ndrop out of sight, if you prefer it, in the bottom of the chair."\r\n\r\nHe lifted the sea-green coverlet. In another moment he would have\r\ndisappeared like a puppet in a show if I had not stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Say nothing more, and do nothing more; I accept your apologies," I\r\nsaid. "When I tell you that I refuse to submit to the opinion of the\r\nScotch Jury, I mean exactly what my words express. That verdict has\r\nleft a stain on my husband\'s character. He feels the stain bitterly. How\r\nbitterly no one knows so well as I do. His sense of his degradation is\r\nthe sense that has parted him from me. It is not enough for _him_ that\r\nI am persuaded of his innocence. Nothing will bring him back to\r\nme--nothing will persuade Eustace that I think him worthy to be the\r\nguide and companion of my life--but the proof of his innocence, set\r\nbefore the Jury which doubts it, and the public which doubts it, to this\r\nday. He and his friends and his lawyers all despair of ever finding that\r\nproof now. But I am his wife; and none of you love him as I love him.\r\nI alone refuse to despair; I alone refuse to listen to reason. If\r\nGod spare me, Mr. Dexter, I dedicate my life to the vindication of my\r\nhusband\'s innocence. You are his old friend--I am here to ask you to\r\nhelp me."\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be now my turn to frighten _him._ The color left his\r\nface. He passed his hand restlessly over his forehead, as if he were\r\ntrying to brush some delusion out of his brain.\r\n\r\n"Is this one of my dreams?" he asked, faintly. "Are you a Vision of the\r\nnight?"\r\n\r\n"I am only a friendless woman," I said, "who has lost all that she loved\r\nand prized, and who is trying to win it back again."\r\n\r\nHe began to move his chair nearer to me once more. I lifted my hand.\r\nHe stopped the chair directly. There was a moment of silence. We sat\r\nwatching one another. I saw his hands tremble as he laid them on the\r\ncoverlet; I saw his face grow paler and paler, and his under lip drop.\r\nWhat dead and buried remembrances had I brought to life in him, in all\r\ntheir olden horror?\r\n\r\nHe was the first to speak again.\r\n\r\n"So this is your interest," he said, "in clearing up the mystery of Mrs.\r\nEustace Macallan\'s death?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And you believe that I can help you?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\nHe slowly lifted one of his hands, and pointed at me with his long\r\nforefinger.\r\n\r\n"You suspect somebody," he said.\r\n\r\nThe tone in which he spoke was low and threatening; it warned me to be\r\ncareful. At the same time, if I now shut him out of my confidence, I\r\nshould lose the reward that might yet be to come, for all that I had\r\nsuffered and risked at that perilous interview.\r\n\r\n"You suspect somebody," he repeated.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps!" was all that I said in return.\r\n\r\n"Is the person within your reach?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet."\r\n\r\n"Do you know where the person is?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nHe laid his head languidly on the back of his chair, with a trembling\r\nlong-drawn sigh. Was he disappointed? Or was he relieved? Or was he\r\nsimply exhausted in mind and body alike? Who could fathom him? Who could\r\nsay?\r\n\r\n"Will you give me five minutes?" he asked, feebly and wearily, without\r\nraising his head. "You know already how any reference to events at\r\nGleninch excites and shakes me. I shall be fit for it again, if you\r\nwill kindly give me a few minutes to myself. There are books in the next\r\nroom. Please excuse me."\r\n\r\nI at once retired to the circular antechamber. He followed me in his\r\nchair, and closed the door between us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. IN THE LIGHT.\r\n\r\nA LITTLE interval of solitude was a relief to me, as well as to\r\nMiserrimus Dexter.\r\n\r\nStartling doubts beset me as I walked restlessly backward and forward,\r\nnow in the anteroom, and now in the corridor outside. It was plain that\r\nI had (quite innocently) disturbed the repose of some formidable secrets\r\nin Miserrimus Dexter\'s mind. I confused and wearied my poor brains\r\nin trying to guess what the secrets might be. All my ingenuity--as\r\nafter-events showed me--was wasted on speculations not one of which\r\neven approached the truth. I was on surer ground when I arrived at the\r\nconclusion that Dexter had really kept every mortal creature out of\r\nhis confidence. He could never have betrayed such serious signs of\r\ndisturbance as I had noticed in him, if he had publicly acknowledged at\r\nthe Trial, or if he had privately communicated to any chosen friend, all\r\nthat he knew of the tragic and terrible drama acted in the bedchamber at\r\nGleninch. What powerful influence had induced him to close his lips?\r\nHad he been silent in mercy to others? or in dread of consequences to\r\nhimself? Impossible to tell! Could I hope that he would confide to Me\r\nwhat he had kept secret from Justice and Friendship alike? When he knew\r\nwhat I really wanted of him, would he arm me, out of his own stores of\r\nknowledge, with the weapon that would win me victory in the struggle to\r\ncome? The chances were against it--there was no denying that. Still the\r\nend was worth trying for. The caprice of the moment might yet stand my\r\nfriend, with such a wayward being as Miserrimus Dexter. My plans and\r\nprojects were sufficiently strange, sufficiently wide of the ordinary\r\nlimits of a woman\'s thoughts and actions, to attract his sympathies.\r\n"Who knows," I thought to myself, "if I may not take his confidence by\r\nsurprise, by simply telling him the truth?"\r\n\r\nThe interval expired; the door was thrown open; the voice of my host\r\nsummoned me again to the inner room.\r\n\r\n"Welcome back!" said Miserrimus Dexter.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs. Valeria, I am quite myself again. How are you?"\r\n\r\nHe looked and spoke with the easy cordiality of an old friend. During\r\nthe period of my absence, short as it was, another change had passed\r\nover this most multiform of living beings. His eyes sparkled with\r\ngood-humor; his cheeks were flushing under a new excitement of some\r\nsort. Even his dress had undergone alteration since I had seen it last.\r\nHe now wore an extemporized cap of white paper; his ruffles were tucked\r\nup; a clean apron was thrown over the sea-green coverlet. He hacked his\r\nchair before me, bowing and smiling, and waved me to a seat with\r\nthe grace of a dancing master, chastened by the dignity of a lord in\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n"I am going to cook," he announced, with the most engaging simplicity.\r\n"We both stand in need of refreshment before we return to the serious\r\nbusiness of our interview. You see me in my cook\'s dress; forgive it.\r\nThere is a form in these things. I am a great stickler for forms. I have\r\nbeen taking some wine. Please sanction that proceeding by taking some\r\nwine too."\r\n\r\nHe filled a goblet of ancient Venetian glass with a purple-red liquor,\r\nbeautiful to see.\r\n\r\n"Burgundy!" he said--"the king of wine: And this is the king of\r\nBurgundies--Clos Vougeot. I drink to your health and happiness!"\r\n\r\nHe filled a second goblet for himself, and honored the toast by draining\r\nit to the bottom. I now understood the sparkle in his eyes and the flush\r\nin his cheeks. It was my interest not to offend him. I drank a little of\r\nhis wine, and I quite agreed with him. I thought it delicious.\r\n\r\n"What shall we eat?" he asked. "It must be something worthy of our Clos\r\nVougeot. Ariel is good at roasting and boiling joints, poor wretch!\r\nbut I don\'t insult your taste by offering you Ariel\'s cookery. Plain\r\njoints!" he exclaimed, with an expression of refined disgust. "Bah!\r\nA man who eats a plain joint is only one remove from a cannibal or a\r\nbutcher. Will you leave it to me to discover something more worthy of\r\nus? Let us go to the kitchen."\r\n\r\nHe wheeled his chair around, and invited me to accompany him with a\r\ncourteous wave of his hand.\r\n\r\nI followed the chair to some closed curtains at one end of the room,\r\nwhich I had not hitherto noticed. Drawing aside the curtains, he\r\nrevealed to view an alcove, in which stood a neat little gas-stove for\r\ncooking. Drawers and cupboards, plates, dishes, and saucepans, were\r\nranged around the alcove--all on a miniature scale, all scrupulously\r\nbright and clean. "Welcome to the kitchen!" said Miserrimus Dexter. He\r\ndrew out of a recess in the wall a marble slab, which served as a table,\r\nand reflected profoundly, with his hand to his head. "I have it!" he\r\ncried, and opening one of the cupboards next, took from it a black\r\nbottle of a form that was new to me. Sounding this bottle with a spike,\r\nhe pierced and produced to view some little irregularly formed black\r\nobjects, which might have been familiar enough to a woman accustomed to\r\nthe luxurious tables of the rich, but which were a new revelation to a\r\nperson like myself, who had led a simple country life in the house of a\r\nclergyman with small means. When I saw my host carefully lay out these\r\noccult substances of uninviting appearance on a clean napkin, and then\r\nplunge once more into profound reflection at the sight of them, my\r\ncuriosity could be no longer restrained. I ventured to say, "What are\r\nthose things, Mr. Dexter, and are we really going to eat them?"\r\n\r\nHe started at the rash question, and looked at me with hands outspread\r\nin irrepressible astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Where is our boasted progress?" he cried. "What is education but a name?\r\nHere is a cultivated person who doesn\'t know Truffles when she sees\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\n"I have heard of truffles," I answered, humbly, "but I never saw them\r\nbefore. We had no such foreign luxuries as those, Mr. Dexter, at home in\r\nthe North."\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter lifted one of the truffles tenderly on his spike, and\r\nheld it up to me in a favorable light.\r\n\r\n"Make the most of one of the few first sensations in this life which\r\nhas no ingredient of disappointment lurking under the surface," he said.\r\n"Look at it; meditate over it. You shall eat it, Mrs. Valeria, stewed in\r\nBurgundy!"\r\n\r\nHe lighted the gas for cooking with the air of a man who was about to\r\noffer me an inestimable proof of his good-will.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me if I observe the most absolute silence," he said, "dating\r\nfrom the moment when I take this in my hand." He produced a bright\r\nlittle stew-pan from his collection of culinary utensils as he spoke.\r\n"Properly pursued, the Art of Cookery allows of no divided attention,"\r\nhe continued, gravely. "In that observation you will find the reason why\r\nno woman ever has reached, or ever will reach, the highest distinction\r\nas a cook. As a rule, women are incapable of absolutely concentrating\r\ntheir attention on any one occupation for any given time. Their\r\nminds will run on something else--say; typically, for the sake of\r\nillustration, their sweetheart or their new bonnet. The one obstacle,\r\nMrs. Valeria, to your rising equal to the men in the various industrial\r\nprocesses of life is not raised, as the women vainly suppose, by the\r\ndefective institutions of the age they live in. No! the obstacle is in\r\nthemselves. No institutions that can be devised to encourage them will\r\never be strong enough to contend successfully with the sweetheart and\r\nthe new bonnet. A little while ago, for instance, I was instrumental in\r\ngetting women employed in our local post-office here. The other day I\r\ntook the trouble--a serious business to me--of getting downstairs, and\r\nwheeling myself away to the office to see how they were getting on. I\r\ntook a letter with me to register. It had an unusually long address. The\r\nregistering woman began copying the address on the receipt form, in a\r\nbusiness-like manner cheering and delightful to see. Half way through, a\r\nlittle child-sister of one of the other women employed trotted into the\r\noffice, and popped under the counter to go and speak to her relative.\r\nThe registering woman\'s mind instantly gave way. Her pencil stopped; her\r\neyes wandered off to the child with a charming expression of interest.\r\n\'Well, Lucy,\' she said, \'how d\'ye do?\' Then she remembered business\r\nagain, and returned to her receipt. When I took it across the counter,\r\nan important line in the address of my letter was left out in the copy.\r\nThanks to Lucy. Now a man in the same position would not have seen\r\nLucy--he would have been too closely occupied with what he was about\r\nat the moment. There is the whole difference between the mental\r\nconstitution of the sexes, which no legislation will ever alter as long\r\nas the world lasts! What does it matter? Women are infinitely superior\r\nto men in the moral qualities which are the true adornments of humanity.\r\nBe content--oh, my mistaken sisters, be content with that!"\r\n\r\nHe twisted his chair around toward the stove. It was useless to dispute\r\nthe question with him, even if I had felt inclined to do so. He absorbed\r\nhimself in his stew-pan.\r\n\r\nI looked about me in the room.\r\n\r\nThe same insatiable relish for horrors exhibited downstairs by the\r\npictures in the hall was displayed again here. The photographs hanging\r\non the wall represented the various forms of madness taken from the\r\nlife. The plaster casts ranged on the shelf opposite were casts (after\r\ndeath) of the heads of famous murderers. A frightful little skeleton\r\nof a woman hung in a cupboard, behind a glazed door, with this cynical\r\ninscription placed above the skull: "Behold the scaffolding on which\r\nbeauty is built!" In a corresponding cupboard, with the door wide\r\nopen, there hung in loose folds a shirt (as I took it to be) of chamois\r\nleather. Touching it (and finding it to be far softer than any chamois\r\nleather that my fingers had ever felt before), I disarranged the folds,\r\nand disclosed a ticket pinned among them, describing the thing in these\r\nhorrid lines: "Skin of a French Marquis, tanned in the Revolution of\r\nNinety-three. Who says the nobility are not good for something? They\r\nmake good leather."\r\n\r\nAfter this last specimen of my host\'s taste in curiosities, I pursued\r\nmy investigation no further. I returned to my chair, and waited for the\r\ntruffles.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief interval, the voice of the poet-painter-composer-and-cook\r\nsummoned me back to the alcove.\r\n\r\nThe gas was out. The stew-pan and its accompaniments had vanished. On\r\nthe marble slab were two plates, two napkins, two rolls of bread, and\r\na dish, with another napkin in it, on which reposed two quaint little\r\nblack balls. Miserrimus Dexter, regarding me with a smile of benevolent\r\ninterest, put one of the balls on my plate, and took the other himself.\r\n"Compose yourself, Mrs. Valeria," he said. "This is an epoch in your\r\nlife. Your first Truffle! Don\'t touch it with the knife. Use the fork\r\nalone. And--pardon me; this is most important--eat slowly."\r\n\r\nI followed my instructions, and assumed an enthusiasm which I honestly\r\nconfess I did not feel. I privately thought the new vegetable a great\r\ndeal too rich, and in other respects quite unworthy of the fuss that had\r\nbeen made about it. Miserrimus Dexter lingered and languished over his\r\ntruffles, and sipped his wonderful Burgundy, and sang his own praises\r\nas a cook until I was really almost mad with impatience to return to\r\nthe real object of my visit. In the reckless state of mind which this\r\nfeeling produced, I abruptly reminded my host that he was wasting our\r\ntime, by the most dangerous question that I could possibly put to him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dexter," I said, "have you seen anything lately of Mrs. Beauly?"\r\n\r\nThe easy sense of enjoyment expressed in his face left it at those rash\r\nwords, and went out like a suddenly extinguished light. That furtive\r\ndistrust of me which I had already noticed instantly made itself felt\r\nagain in his manner and in his voice.\r\n\r\n"Do you know Mrs. Beauly?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I only know her," I answered, "by what I have read of her in the\r\nTrial."\r\n\r\nHe was not satisfied with that reply.\r\n\r\n"You must have an interest of some sort in Mrs. Beauly," he said, "or\r\nyou would not have asked me about her. Is it the interest of a friend,\r\nor the interest of an enemy?"\r\n\r\nRash as I might be, I was not quite reckless enough yet to meet that\r\nplain question by an equally plain reply. I saw enough in his face to\r\nwarn me to be careful with him before it was too late.\r\n\r\n"I can only answer you in one way," I rejoined. "I must return to a\r\nsubject which is very painful to you--the subject of the Trial."\r\n\r\n"Go on," he said, with one of his grim outbursts of humor. "Here I am at\r\nyour mercy--a martyr at the stake. Poke the fire! poke the fire!"\r\n\r\n"I am only an ignorant woman," I resumed, "and I dare say I am quite\r\nwrong; but there is one part of my husband\'s trial which doesn\'t at\r\nall satisfy me. The defense set up for him seems to me to have been a\r\ncomplete mistake."\r\n\r\n"A complete mistake?" he repeated. "Strange language, Mrs. Valeria, to\r\nsay the least of it!" He tried to speak lightly; he took up his goblet\r\nof wine; but I could see that I had produced an effect on him. His hand\r\ntrembled as it carried the wine to his lips.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt that Eustace\'s first wife really asked him to buy the\r\narsenic," I continued. "I don\'t doubt that she used it secretly to\r\nimprove her complexion. But w hat I do _not_ believe is that she died of\r\nan overdose of the poison, taken by mistake."\r\n\r\nHe put back the goblet of wine on the table near him so unsteadily that\r\nhe spilled the greater part of it. For a moment his eyes met mine, then\r\nlooked down again.\r\n\r\n"How do you believe she died?" he inquired, in tones so low that I could\r\nbarely hear them.\r\n\r\n"By the hand of a poisoner," I answered.\r\n\r\nHe made a movement as if he were about to start up in the chair, and\r\nsank back again, seized, apparently, with a sudden faintness.\r\n\r\n"Not my husband!" I hastened to add. "You know that I am satisfied of\r\n_his_ innocence."\r\n\r\nI saw him shudder. I saw his hands fasten their hold convulsively on the\r\narms of his chair.\r\n\r\n"Who poisoned her?" he asked, still lying helplessly back in the chair.\r\n\r\nAt the critical moment my courage failed me. I was afraid to tell him in\r\nwhat direction my suspicions pointed.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you guess?" I said.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. I supposed him to be secretly following his own\r\ntrain of thought. It was not for long. On a sudden he started up in his\r\nchair. The prostration which had possessed him appeared to vanish in\r\nan instant. His eyes recovered their wild light; his hands were steady\r\nagain; his color was brighter than ever. Had he been pondering over the\r\nsecret of my interest in Mrs. Beauly? and had he guessed? He had!\r\n\r\n"Answer on your word of honor!" he cried. "Don\'t attempt to deceive me!\r\nIs it a woman?"\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"What is the first letter of her name? Is it one of the first three\r\nletters of the alphabet?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"B?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Beauly?"\r\n\r\n"Beauly."\r\n\r\nHe threw his hands up above his head, and burst into a frantic fit of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n"I have lived long enough!" he broke out, wildly. "At last I have\r\ndiscovered one other person in the world who sees it as plainly as I\r\ndo. Cruel Mrs. Valeria! why did you torture me? Why didn\'t you own it\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\n"What!" I exclaimed, catching the infection of his excitement. "Are\r\n_your_ ideas _my_ ideas? Is it possible that _you_ suspect Mrs. Beauly\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\nHe made this remarkable reply:\r\n\r\n"Suspect?" he repeated, contemptuously. "There isn\'t the shadow of a\r\ndoubt about it. Mrs. Beauly poisoned her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. THE INDICTMENT OF MRS. BEAULY.\r\n\r\nI STARTED to my feet, and looked at Miserrimus Dexter. I was too much\r\nagitated to be able to speak to him.\r\n\r\nMy utmost expectations had not prepared me for the tone of absolute\r\nconviction in which he had spoken. At the best, I had anticipated that\r\nhe might, by the barest chance, agree with me in suspecting Mrs. Beauly.\r\nAnd now his own lips had said it, without hesitation or reserve! "There\r\nisn\'t the shadow of a doubt: Mrs. Beauly poisoned her."\r\n\r\n"Sit down," he said, quietly. "There\'s nothing to be afraid of. Nobody\r\ncan hear us in this room."\r\n\r\nI sat down again, and recovered myself a little.\r\n\r\n"Have you never told any one else what you have just told me?" was the\r\nfirst question that I put to him.\r\n\r\n"Never. No one else suspected her."\r\n\r\n"Not even the lawyers?"\r\n\r\n"Not even the lawyers. There is no legal evidence against Mrs. Beauly.\r\nThere is nothing but moral certainty."\r\n\r\n"Surely you might have found the evidence if you had tried?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed at the idea.\r\n\r\n"Look at me!" he said. "How is a man to hunt up evidence who is tied to\r\nthis chair? Besides, there were other difficulties in my way. I am not\r\ngenerally in the habit of needlessly betraying myself--I am a cautious\r\nman, though you may not have noticed it. But my immeasurable hatred of\r\nMrs. Beauly was not to be concealed. If eyes can tell secrets, she must\r\nhave discovered, in my eyes, that I hungered and thirsted to see her in\r\nthe hangman\'s hands. From first to last, I tell you, Mrs. Borgia-Beauly\r\nwas on her guard against me. Can I describe her cunning? All my\r\nresources of language are not equal to the task. Take the degrees of\r\ncomparison to give you a faint idea of it: I am positively cunning; the\r\ndevil is comparatively cunning; Mrs. Beauly is superlatively cunning.\r\nNo! no! If she is ever discovered, at this distance of time, it will not\r\nbe done by a man--it will be done by a woman: a woman whom she doesn\'t\r\nsuspect; a woman who can watch her with the patience of a tigress in a\r\nstate of starvation--"\r\n\r\n"Say a woman like Me!" I broke out. "I am ready to try."\r\n\r\nHis eyes glittered; his teeth showed themselves viciously under his\r\nmustache; he drummed fiercely with both hands on the arms of his chair.\r\n\r\n"Do you really mean it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Put me in your position," I answered. "Enlighten me with your moral\r\ncertainty (as you call it)--and you shall see!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it!" he said. "Tell me one thing first. How did an outside\r\nstranger, like you, come to suspect her?"\r\n\r\nI set before him, to the best of my ability, the various elements of\r\nsuspicion which I had collected from the evidence at the Trial; and\r\nI laid especial stress on the fact (sworn to by the nurse) that Mrs.\r\nBeauly was missing exactly at he time when Christina Ormsay had left\r\nMrs. Eustace Macallan alone in her room.\r\n\r\n"You have hit it!" cried Miserrimus Dexter. "You are a wonderful woman!\r\nWhat was she doing on the morning of the day when Mrs. Eustace Macallan\r\ndied poisoned? And where was she during the dark hours of the night? I\r\ncan tell you where she was _not_--she was not in her own room."\r\n\r\n"Not in her own room?" I repeated. "Are you really sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure of everything that I say, when I am speaking of Mrs. Beauly.\r\nMind that: and now listen! This is a drama; and I excel in dramatic\r\nnarrative. You shall judge for yourself. Date, the twentieth of October.\r\nScene the Corridor, called the Guests\' Corridor, at Gleninch. On one\r\nside, a row of windows looking out into the garden. On the other, a row\r\nof four bedrooms, with dressing-rooms attached. First bedroom (beginning\r\nfrom the staircase), occupied by Mrs. Beauly. Second bedroom, empty.\r\nThird bedroom, occupied by Miserrimus Dexter. Fourth bedroom, empty. So\r\nmuch for the Scene! The time comes next--the time is eleven at night.\r\nDexter discovered in his bedroom, reading. Enter to him Eustace\r\nMacallan. Eustace speaks: \'My dear fellow, be particularly careful\r\nnot to make any noise; don\'t bowl your chair up and down the corridor\r\nto-night.\' Dexter inquires, \'Why?\' Eustace answers: \'Mrs. Beauly has\r\nbeen dining with some friends in Edinburgh, and has come back terribly\r\nfatigued: she has gone up to her room to rest.\' Dexter makes another\r\ninquiry (satirical inquiry, this time): \'How does she look when she is\r\nterribly fatigued? As beautiful as ever?\' Answer: \'I don t know; I have\r\nnot seen her; she slipped upstairs, without speaking to anybody.\' Third\r\ninquiry by Dexter (logical inquiry, on this occasion): \'If she spoke to\r\nnobody, how do you know she is fatigued?\' Eustace hands Dexter a morsel\r\nof paper, and answers: \'Don t be a fool! I found this on the hall table.\r\nRemember what I have told you about keeping quiet; good-night!\' Eustace\r\nretires. Dexter looks at the paper, and reads these lines in pencil:\r\n\'Just returned. Please forgive me for going to bed without saying\r\ngood-night. I have overexerted myself; I am dreadfully fatigued.\r\n(Signed) Helena.\' Dexter is by nature suspicious. Dexter suspects Mrs.\r\nBeauly. Never mind his reasons; there is no time to enter into his\r\nreasons now. He puts the ease to himself thus: \'A weary woman would\r\nnever have given herself the trouble to write this. She would have found\r\nit much less fatiguing to knock at the drawing-room door as she passed,\r\nand to make her apologies by word of mouth. I see something here out\r\nof the ordinary way; I shall make a night of it in my chair. Very good.\r\nDexter proceeds to make a night of it. He opens his door; wheels himself\r\nsoftly into the corridor; locks the doors of the two empty bedrooms, and\r\nreturns (with the keys in his pocket) to his own room. \'Now,\' says D.\r\nto himself, \'if I hear a door softly opened in this part of the house,\r\nI shall know for certain it is Mrs. Beauly\'s door!\' Upon that he closes\r\nhis own door, leaving the tiniest little chink to look through; puts out\r\nhis light; and waits and watches at his tiny little chink, like a cat at\r\na mouse-hole. The corridor is the only place he wants to see; and a lamp\r\nburns there all night. Twelve o\'clock strikes; he hears the doors below\r\nbolted and locked, and nothing happens. Half-past twelve--and\r\nnothing still. The house is as silent as the grave. One o\'clock; two\r\no\'clock--same silence. Half-past two--and something happens at last.\r\nDexter hears a sound close by, in the corridor. It is the sound of\r\na handle turning very softly in a door--in the only door that can be\r\nopened, the door of Mrs. Beauly\'s room. Dexter drops noiselessly from\r\nhis chair onto his hands; lies flat on the floor at his chink, and\r\nlistens. He hears the handle closed again; he sees a dark object flit\r\nby him; he pops his head out of his door, down on the floor where nobody\r\nwould think of looking for him. And what does he see? Mrs. Beauly! There\r\nshe goes, with the long brown cloak over her shoulders, which she\r\nwears when she is driving, floating behind her. In a moment more she\r\ndisappears, past the fourth bedroom, and turns at a right angle, into a\r\nsecond corridor, called the South Corridor. What rooms are in the South\r\nCorridor? There are three rooms. First room, the little study,\r\nmentioned in the nurse\'s evidence. Second room, Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s\r\nbedchamber. Third room, her husband\'s bedchamber. What does Mrs. Beauly\r\n(supposed to be worn out by fatigue) want in that part of the house\r\nat half-past two in the morning? Dexter decides on running the risk of\r\nbeing seen--and sets off on a voyage of discovery. Do you know how\r\nhe gets from place to place without his chair? Have you seen the poor\r\ndeformed creature hop on his hands? Shall he show you how he does it,\r\nbefore he goes on with his story?"\r\n\r\nI hastened to stop the proposed exhibition.\r\n\r\n"I saw you hop last night," I said. "Go on!--pray go on with your story!\r\n\r\n"Do you like my dramatic style of narrative?" he asked. "Am I\r\ninteresting?"\r\n\r\n"Indescribably interesting, Mr. Dexter. I am eager to hear more."\r\n\r\nHe smiled in high approval of his own abilities.\r\n\r\n"I am equally good at the autobiographical style," he said. "Shall we\r\ntry that next, by way of variety?"\r\n\r\n"Anything you like," I cried, losing all patience with him, "if you will\r\nonly go on!"\r\n\r\n"Part Two; Autobiographical Style," he announced, with a wave of his\r\nhand. "I hopped along the Guests\' Corridor, and turned into the South\r\nCorridor. I stopped at the little study. Door open; nobody there. I\r\ncrossed the study to the second door, communicating with Mrs. Macallan\'s\r\nbedchamber. Locked! I looked through the keyhole Was there something\r\nhanging over it, on the other side? I can\'t say--I only know there was\r\nnothing to be seen but blank darkness. I listened. Nothing to be heard.\r\nSame blank darkness, same absolute silence, inside the locked second\r\ndoor of Mrs. Eustace\'s room, opening on the corridor. I went on to her\r\nhusband\'s bedchamber. I had the worst possible opinion of Mrs. Beauly--I\r\nshould not have been in the least surprised if I had caught her in\r\nEustace\'s room. I looked through the keyhole. In this case, the key\r\nwas out of it--or was turned the right way for me--I don\'t know which.\r\nEustace\'s bed was opposite the door. No discovery. I could see him, all\r\nby himself, innocently asleep. I reflected a little. The back staircase\r\nwas at the end of the corridor, beyond me. I slid down the stairs, and\r\nlooked about me on the lower floor, by the light of the night-lamp.\r\nDoors all fast locked and keys outside, so that I could try them myself.\r\nHouse door barred and bolted. Door leading into the servants\' offices\r\nbarred and bolted. I got back to my own room, and thought it out\r\nquietly. Where could she be? Certainly _in_ the house, somewhere. Where?\r\nI had made sure of the other rooms; the field of search was exhausted.\r\nShe could only be in Mrs. Macallan\'s room--the _one_ room which had\r\nbaffled my investigations; the _only_ room which had not lent itself\r\nto examination. Add to this that the key of the door in the study,\r\ncommunicating with Mrs. Macallan\'s room, was stated in the nurse\'s\r\nevidence to be missing; and don\'t forget that the dearest object of Mrs.\r\nBeauly\'s life (on the showing of her own letter, read at the Trial) was\r\nto be Eustace Macallan\'s happy wife. Put these things together in your\r\nown mind, and you will know what my thoughts were, as I sat waiting for\r\nevents in my chair, without my telling you. Toward four o\'clock, strong\r\nas I am, fatigue got the better of me. I fell asleep. Not for long.\r\nI awoke with a start and looked at my watch. Twenty-five minutes past\r\nfour. Had she got back to her room while I was asleep? I hopped to her\r\ndoor and listened. Not a sound. I softly opened the door. The room was\r\nempty. I went back again to my own room to wait and watch. It was hard\r\nwork to keep my eyes open. I drew up the window to let the cool air\r\nrefresh me; I fought hard with exhausted nature, and exhausted nature\r\nwon. I fell asleep again. This time it was eight in the morning when\r\nI awoke. I have goodish ears, as you may have noticed. I heard women\'s\r\nvoices talking under my open window. I peeped out. Mrs. Beauly and her\r\nmaid in close confabulation! Mrs. Beauly and her maid looking guiltily\r\nabout them to make sure that they were neither seen nor heard! \'Take\r\ncare, ma\'am,\' I heard the maid say; \'that horrid deformed monster is as\r\nsly as a fox. Mind he doesn\'t discover you.\' Mrs. Beauly answered, \'You\r\ngo first, and look out in front; I will follow you, and make sure there\r\nis nobody behind us.\' With that they disappeared around the corner of\r\nthe house. In five minutes more I heard the door of Mrs. Beauly\'s room\r\nsoftly opened and closed again. Three hours later the nurse met her in\r\nthe corridor, innocently on her way to make inquiries at Mrs. Eustace\r\nMacallan\'s door. What do you think of these circumstances? What do you\r\nthink of Mrs. Beauly and her maid having something to say to each other,\r\nwhich they didn\'t dare say in the house--for fear of my being behind\r\nsome door listening to them? What do you think of these discoveries of\r\nmine being made on the very morning when Mrs. Eustace was taken ill--on\r\nthe very day when she died by a poisoner\'s hand? Do you see your way to\r\nthe guilty person? And has mad Miserrimus Dexter been of some assistance\r\nto you, so far?"\r\n\r\nI was too violently excited to answer him. The way to the vindication of\r\nmy husband\'s innocence was opened to me at last!\r\n\r\n"Where is she?" I cried. "And where is that servant who is in her\r\nconfidence?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you," he said. "I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Where can I inquire? Can you tell me that?"\r\n\r\nHe considered a little. "There is one man who must know where she is--or\r\nwho could find it out for you," he said.\r\n\r\n"Who is he? What is his name?"\r\n\r\n"He is a friend of Eustace\'s. Major Fitz-David."\r\n\r\n"I know him! I am going to dine with him next week. He has asked you to\r\ndine too."\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter laughed contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"Major Fitz-David may do very well for the ladies," he said. "The ladies\r\ncan treat him as a species of elderly human lap-dog. I don t dine with\r\nlap-dogs; I have said, No. You go. He or some of his ladies may be of\r\nuse to you. Who are the guests? Did he tell you?"\r\n\r\n"There was a French lady whose name I forget," I said, "and Lady\r\nClarinda--"\r\n\r\n"That will do! She is a friend of Mrs. Beauly\'s. She is sure to\r\nknow where Mrs. Beauly is. Come to me the moment you have got your\r\ninformation. Find out if the maid is with her: she is the easiest to\r\ndeal with of the two. Only make the maid open her lips, and we have\r\ngot Mrs. Beauly. We crush her," he cried, bringing his hand down like\r\nlightning on the last languid fly of the season, crawling over the arm\r\nof his chair--"we crush her as I crush this fly. Stop! A question--a\r\nmost important question in dealing with the maid. Have you got any\r\nmoney?"\r\n\r\n"Plenty of money."\r\n\r\nHe snapped his fingers joyously.\r\n\r\n"The maid is ours!" he cried. "It\'s a matter of pounds, shillings, and\r\npence with the maid. Wait! Another question. About your name? If you\r\napproach Mrs. Beauly in your own character as Eustace\'s wife, you\r\napproach her as the woman who has taken her place--you make a mortal\r\nenemy of her at starting. Beware of that!"\r\n\r\nMy jealousy of Mrs. Beauly, smoldering in me all through the interview,\r\nburst into flames at those words. I could resist it no longer--I was\r\nobliged to ask him if my husband had ever loved her.\r\n\r\n"Tell me the truth," I said. "Did Eustace really--?"\r\n\r\nHe burst out laughing maliciously, he penetrated my jealousy, and\r\nguessed my question almost before it had passed my lips.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "Eustace did really love her--and no mistake about it.\r\nShe had every reason to believe (before the Trial) that the wife\'s death\r\nwould put her in the wife\'s place. But the Trial made another man of\r\nEustace. Mrs. Beauly had been a witness of the public degradation of\r\nhim. That was enough to prevent his marrying Mrs. Beauly. He broke off\r\nwith her at once and forever--for the same reason precisely which has\r\nled him to separate himself from you. Existence with a woman who knew\r\nthat he had been tried for his life as a murderer was an existence that\r\nhe was not hero enough to face. You wanted the truth. There it is! You\r\nhave need to be cautious of Mrs. Beauly--you have no need to be jealous\r\nof her. Take the safe course. Arrange with the Major, when you meet Lady\r\nClarinda at his dinner, that you meet her under an assumed name."\r\n\r\n"I can go to the dinner," I said, "under the name in which Eustace\r\nmarried me. I can go as \'Mrs. Woodville.\'"\r\n\r\n"The very thing!" he exclaimed. "What would I not give to be present\r\nwhen Lady Clarinda introduces you to Mrs. Beauly! Think of the\r\nsituation. A woman with a hideous secret hidden in her inmost soul: and\r\nanother woman who knows of it--another woman who is bent, by fair means\r\nor foul, on dragging that secret into the light of day. What a struggle!\r\nWhat a plot for a novel! I am in a fever when I think of it. I am beside\r\nmyself when I look into the future, and see Mrs. Borgia-Beauly brought\r\nto her knees at last. Don\'t be alarmed!" he cried, with the wild light\r\nflashing once more in his eyes. "My brains are beginning to boil again\r\nin my head. I must take refuge in physical exercise. I must blow off the\r\nsteam, or I shall explode in my pink jacket on the spot!"\r\n\r\nThe old madness seized on him again. I made for the door, to secure my\r\nretreat in case of necessity--and then ventured to look around at him.\r\n\r\nHe was off on his furious wheels--half man, half chair--flying like\r\na whirlwind to the other end of the room. Even this exercise was not\r\nviolent enough for him in his present mood. In an instant he was down\r\non the floor, poised on his hands, and looking in the distance like a\r\nmonstrous frog. Hopping down the room, he overthrew, one after another,\r\nall the smaller and lighter chairs as he passed them; arrived at the\r\nend, he turned, surveyed the prostrate chairs, encouraged himself with\r\na scream of triumph, and leaped rapidly over chair after chair on his\r\nhands--his limbless body now thrown back from the shoulders, and now\r\nthrown forward to keep the balance--in a manner at once wonderful and\r\nhorrible to behold. "Dexter\'s Leap-frog!" he cried, cheerfully, perching\r\nhimself with his birdlike lightness on the last of the prostrate chairs\r\nwhen he had reached the further end of the room. "I\'m pretty active,\r\nMrs. Valeria, considering I\'m a cripple. Let us drink to the hanging of\r\nMrs. Beauly in another bottle of Burgundy!"\r\n\r\nI seized desperately on the first excuse that occurred to me for getting\r\naway from him.\r\n\r\n"You forget," I said--"I must go at once to the Major. If I don\'t warn\r\nhim in time, he may speak of me to Lady Clarinda by the wrong name."\r\n\r\nIdeas of hurry and movement were just the ideas to take his fancy in his\r\npresent state. He blew furiously on the whistle that summoned Ariel from\r\nthe kitchen regions, and danced up and down on his hands in the full\r\nfrenzy of his delight.\r\n\r\n"Ariel shall get you a cab!" he cried. "Drive at a gallop to the\r\nMajor\'s. Set the trap for her without losing a moment. Oh, what a day of\r\ndays this has been! Oh, what a relief to get rid of my dreadful secret,\r\nand share it with You! I am suffocating with happiness--I am like\r\nthe Spirit of the Earth in Shelley\'s poem." He broke out with the\r\nmagnificent lines in "Prometheus Unbound," in which the Earth feels\r\nthe Spirit of Love, and bursts into speech. "\'The joy, the triumph, the\r\ndelight, the madness! the boundless, overflowing, bursting gladness!\r\nthe vaporous exultation not to be confined! Ha! ha! the animation of\r\ndelight, which wraps me like an atmosphere of light, and bears me as a\r\ncloud is borne by its own wind.\' That\'s how I feel, Valeria!--that\'s how\r\nI feel!"\r\n\r\nI crossed the threshold while he was still speaking. The last I saw of\r\nhim he was pouring out that glorious flood of words--his deformed body,\r\npoised on the overthrown chair, his face lifted in rapture to some\r\nfantastic heaven of his own making. I slipped out softly into the\r\nantechamber. Even as I crossed the room, he changed once more. I heard\r\nhis ringing cry; I heard the soft thump-thump of his hands on the floor.\r\nHe was going down the room again, in "Dexter\'s Leap-frog," flying over\r\nthe prostrate chairs.\r\n\r\nIn the hall, Ariel was on the watch for me.\r\n\r\nAs I approached her, I happened to be putting on my gloves. She stopped\r\nme; and, taking my right arm, lifted my hand toward her face. Was she\r\ngoing to kiss it? or to bite it? Neither. She smelt it like a dog--and\r\ndropped it again with a hoarse chuckling laugh.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t smell of his perfumes," she said. "You _haven\'t_ touched his\r\nbeard. _Now_ I believe you. Want a cab?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I\'ll walk till I meet a cab."\r\n\r\nShe was bent on being polite to me--now I had _not_ touched his beard.\r\n\r\n"I say!" she burst out, in her deepest notes.\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad I didn\'t upset you in the canal. There now!"\r\n\r\nShe gave me a friendly smack on the shoulder which nearly knocked me\r\ndown--relapsed, the instant after, into her leaden stolidity of look\r\nand manner---and led the way out by the front door. I heard her hoarse\r\nchuckling laugh as she locked the gate behind me. My star was at last\r\nin the ascendant! In one and the same day I had found my way into the\r\nconfidence of Ariel and Ariel\'s master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. THE DEFENSE OF MRS. BEAULY.\r\n\r\nTHE days that elapsed before Major Fitz-David\'s dinner-party were\r\nprecious days to me.\r\n\r\nMy long interview with Miserrimus Dexter had disturbed me far more\r\nseriously than I suspected at the time. It was not until some hours\r\nafter I had left him that I really began to feel how my nerves had been\r\ntried by all that I had seen and heard during my visit at his house.\r\nI started at the slightest noises; I dreamed of dreadful things; I was\r\nready to cry without reason at one moment, and to fly into a passion\r\nwithout reason at another. Absolute rest was what I wanted, and (thanks\r\nto my good Benjamin) was what I got. The dear old man controlled his\r\nanxieties on my account, and spared me the questions which his fatherly\r\ninterest in my welfare made him eager to ask. It was tacitly understood\r\nbetween us that all conversation on the subject of my visit to\r\nMiserrimus Dexter (of which, it is needless to say, he strongly\r\ndisapproved) should be deferred until repose had restored my energies of\r\nbody and mind. I saw no visitors. Mrs. Macallan came to the cottage,\r\nand Major Fitz-David came to the cottage--one of them to hear what had\r\npassed between Miserrimus Dexter and myself, the other to amuse me with\r\nthe latest gossip about the guests at the forthcoming dinner. Benjamin\r\ntook it on himself to make my apologies, and to spare me the exertion\r\nof receiving my visitors. We hired a little open carriage, and took long\r\ndrives in the pretty country lanes still left flourishing within a\r\nfew miles of the northern suburb of London. At home we sat and talked\r\nquietly of old times, or played at backgammon and dominoes--and so, for\r\na few happy days, led the peaceful unadventurous life which was good for\r\nme. When the day of the dinner arrived, I felt restored to my customary\r\nhealth. I was ready again, and eager again, for the introduction to Lady\r\nClarinda and the discovery of Mrs. Beauly.\r\n\r\nBenjamin looked a little sadly at my flushed face as we drove to Major\r\nFitz-David\'s house.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear," he said, in his simple way, "I see you are well again!\r\nYou have had enough of our quiet life already."\r\n\r\nMy recollection of events and persons, in general, at the dinner-party,\r\nis singularly indistinct.\r\n\r\nI remember that we were very merry, and as easy and familiar with one\r\nanother as if we had been old friends. I remember that Madame Mirliflore\r\nwas unapproachably superior to the other women present, in the perfect\r\nbeauty of her dress, and in the ample justice which she did to the\r\nluxurious dinner set before us. I remember the Major\'s young prima\r\ndonna, more round-eyed, more overdressed, more shrill and strident as\r\nthe coming "Queen of Song," than ever. I remember the Major himself,\r\nalways kissing our hands, always luring us to indulge in dainty dishes\r\nand drinks, always making love, always detecting resemblances between\r\nus, always "under the charm," and never once out of his character\r\nas elderly Don Juan from the beginning of the evening to the end.\r\nI remember dear old Benjamin, completely bewildered, shrinking into\r\ncorners, blushing when he was personally drawn into the conversation,\r\nfrightened at Madame Mirliflore, bashful with Lady Clarinda, submissive\r\nto the Major, suffering under the music, and from the bottom of his\r\nhonest old heart wishing himself home again. And there, as to the\r\nmembers of that cheerful little gathering, my memory finds its\r\nlimits--with one exception. The appearance of Lady Clarinda is as\r\npresent to me as if I had met her yesterday; and of the memorable\r\nconversation which we two held together privately, toward the close of\r\nthe evening, it is no exaggeration to say that I can still call to mind\r\nalmost every word.\r\n\r\nI see her dress, I hear her voice again, while I write.\r\n\r\nShe was attired, I remember, with that extreme assumption of simplicity\r\nwhich always defeats its own end by irresistibly suggesting art. She\r\nwore plain white muslin, over white silk, without trimming or ornament\r\nof any kind. Her rich brown hair, dressed in defiance of the prevailing\r\nfashion, was thrown back from her forehead, and gathered into a simple\r\nknot behind--without adornment of any sort. A little white ribbon\r\nencircled her neck, fastened by the only article of jewelry that she\r\nwore--a tiny diamond brooch. She was unquestionably handsome; but her\r\nbeauty was of the somewhat hard and angular type which is so often seen\r\nin English women of her race: the nose and chin too prominent and too\r\nfirmly shaped; the well-opened gray eyes full of spirit and dignity, but\r\nwanting in tenderness and mobility of expression. Her manner had all\r\nthe charm which fine breeding can confer--exquisitely polite, easily\r\ncordial; showing that perfect yet unobtrusive confidence in herself\r\nwhich (in England) seems to be the natural outgrowth of pre-eminent\r\nsocial rank. If you had accepted her for what she was, on the surface,\r\nyou would have said, Here is the model of a noble woman who is perfectly\r\nfree from pride. And if you had taken a liberty with her, on the\r\nstrength of that conviction, she would have made you remember it to the\r\nend of your life.\r\n\r\nWe got on together admirably. I was introduced as "Mrs. Woodville," by\r\nprevious arrangement with the Major--effected through Benjamin. Before\r\nthe dinner was over we had promised to exchange visits. Nothing but the\r\nopportunity was wanting to lead Lady Clarinda into talking, as I wanted\r\nher to talk, of Mrs. Beauly.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening the opportunity came.\r\n\r\nI had taken refuge from the terrible bravura singing of the Major\'s\r\nstrident prima donna in the back drawing-room. As I had hoped and\r\nanticipated, after a while Lady Clarinda (missing me from the group\r\naround the piano) came in search of me. She seated herself by my side,\r\nout of sight and out of hearing of our friends in the front room; and,\r\nto my infinite relief and delight, touched on the subject of Miserrimus\r\nDexter of her own accord. Something I had said of him, when his name had\r\nbeen accidentally mentioned at dinner, remained in her memory, and led\r\nus, by perfectly natural gradations, into speaking of Mrs. Beauly. "At\r\nlast," I thought to myself, "the Major\'s little dinner will bring me my\r\nreward!"\r\n\r\nAnd what a reward it was, when it came! My heart sinks in me again--as\r\nit sank on that never-to-be-forgotten evening--while I sit at my desk\r\nthinking of it.\r\n\r\n"So Dexter really spoke to you of Mrs. Beauly!" exclaimed Lady Clarinda.\r\n"You have no idea how you surprise me."\r\n\r\n"May I ask why?"\r\n\r\n"He hates her! The last time I saw him he wouldn\'t allow me to mention\r\nher name. It is one of his innumerable oddities. If any such feeling as\r\nsympathy is a possible feeling in such a nature as his, he ought to like\r\nHelena Beauly. She is the most completely unconventional person I know.\r\nWhen she does break out, poor dear, she says things and does things\r\nwhich are almost reckless enough to be worthy of Dexter himself. I\r\nwonder whether you would like her?"\r\n\r\n"You have kindly asked me to visit you, Lady Clarinda. Perhaps I may\r\nmeet her at your house?"\r\n\r\n"I hope you will not wait until that is likely to happen," she said.\r\n"Helena\'s last whim is to fancy that she has got--the gout, of all the\r\nmaladies in the world! She is away at some wonderful baths in Hungary\r\nor Bohemia (I don\'t remember which)--and where she will go, or what she\r\nwill do next, it is perfectly impossible to say.--Dear Mrs. Woodville!\r\nis the heat of the fire too much for you? You are looking quite pale."\r\n\r\nI _felt_ that I was looking pale. The discovery of Mrs. Beauly\'s absence\r\nfrom England was a shock for which I was quite unprepared. For a moment\r\nit unnerved me.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go into the other room?" asked Lady Clarinda.\r\n\r\nTo go into the other room would be to drop the conversation. I was\r\ndetermined not to let that catastrophe happen. It was just possible that\r\nMrs. Beauly\'s maid might have quitted her service, or might have been\r\nleft behind in England. My information would not be complete until I\r\nknew what had become of the maid. I pushed my chair back a little from\r\nthe fire-place, and took a hand-screen from a table near me; it might be\r\nmade useful in hiding my face, if any more disappointments were in store\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Lady Clarinda; I was only a little too near the fire. I\r\nshall do admirably here. You surprise me about Mrs. Beauly. From what\r\nMr. Dexter said to me, I had imagined--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must not believe anything Dexter tells you!" interposed Lady\r\nClarinda. "He delights in mystifying people; and he purposely misled\r\nyou, I have no doubt. If all that I hear is true, _he_ ought to know\r\nmore of Helena Beauly\'s strange freaks and fancies than most people.\r\nHe all but discovered her in one of her adventures (down in Scotland),\r\nwhich reminds me of the story in Auber\'s charming opera--what is it\r\ncalled? I shall forget my own name next! I mean the opera in which the\r\ntwo nuns slip out of the convent, and go to the ball. Listen! How very\r\nodd! That vulgar girl is singing the castanet song in the second act at\r\nthis moment. Major! what opera is the young lady singing from?"\r\n\r\nThe Major was scandalized at this interruption. He bustled into the\r\nback room--whispered, "Hush! hush! my dear lady; the \'Domino Noir\'"--and\r\nbustled back again to the piano.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" said Lady Clarinda. "How stupid of me! The \'Domino Noir.\'\r\nAnd how strange that you should forget it too!"\r\n\r\nI had remembered it perfectly; but I could not trust myself to speak.\r\nIf, as I believed, the "adventure" mentioned by Lady Clarinda was\r\nconnected, in some way, with Mrs. Beauly\'s mysterious proceedings on the\r\nmorning of the twenty-first of October, I was on the brink of the very\r\ndiscovery which it was the one interest of my life to make! I held the\r\nscreen so as to hide my face; and I said, in the steadiest voice that I\r\ncould command at the moment,\r\n\r\n"Pray go on!--pray tell me what the adventure was!"\r\n\r\nLady Clarinda was quite flattered by my eager desire to hear the coming\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n"I hope my story will be worthy of the interest which you are so good as\r\nto feel in it," she said. "If you only knew Helena--it is _so_ like\r\nher! I have it, you must know, from her maid. She has taken a woman who\r\nspeaks foreign languages with her to Hungary and she has left the maid\r\nwith me. A perfect treasure! I should be only too glad if I could keep\r\nher in my service: she has but one defect, a name I hate--Phoebe. Well!\r\nPhoebe and her mistress were staying at a place near Edinburgh, called\r\n(I think) Gleninch. The house belonged to that Mr. Macallan who was\r\nafterward tried--you remember it, of course?--for poisoning his wife. A\r\ndreadful case; but don\'t be alarmed--my story has nothing to do with\r\nit; my story has to do with Helena Beauly. One evening (while she was\r\nstaying at Gleninch) she was engaged to dine with some English friends\r\nvisiting Edinburgh. The same night--also in Edinburgh--there was a\r\nmasked ball, given by somebody whose name I forget. The ball (almost\r\nan unparalleled event in Scotland!) was reported to be not at all a\r\nreputable affair. All sorts of amusing people were to be there. Ladies\r\nof doubtful virtue, you know, and gentlemen on the outlying limits of\r\nsociety, and so on. Helena\'s friends had contrived to get cards, and\r\nwere going, in spite of the objections--in the strictest incognito, of\r\ncourse, trusting to their masks. And Helena herself was bent on going\r\nwith them, if she could only manage it without being discovered\r\nat Gleninch. Mr. Macallan was one of the strait-laced people who\r\ndisapproved of the ball. No lady, he said, could show herself at such\r\nan entertainment without compromising her reputation. What stuff! Well,\r\nHelena, in one of her wildest moments, hit on a way of going to the ball\r\nwithout discovery which was really as ingenious as a plot in a French\r\nplay. She went to the dinner in the carriage from Gleninch, having sent\r\nPhoebe to Edinburgh before her. It was not a grand dinner--a little\r\nfriendly gathering: no evening dress. When the time came for going back\r\nto Gleninch, what do you think Helena did? She sent her maid back in the\r\ncarriage, instead of herself! Phoebe was dressed in her mistress\'s cloak\r\nand bonnet and veil. She was instructed to run upstairs the moment she\r\ngot to the house, leaving on the hall table a little note of apology\r\n(written by Helena, of course!), pleading fatigue as an excuse for not\r\nsaying good-night to her host. The mistress and the maid were about\r\nthe same height; and the servants naturally never discovered the\r\ntrick. Phoebe got up to her mistress\'s room safely enough. There, her\r\ninstructions were to wait until the house was quiet for the night, and\r\nthen to steal up to her own room. While she was waiting, the girl fell\r\nasleep. She only awoke at two in the morning, or later. It didn\'t much\r\nmatter, as she thought. She stole out on tiptoe, and closed the door\r\nbehind her. Before she was at the end of the corridor, she fancied she\r\nheard something. She waited until she was safe on the upper story,\r\nand then she looked over the banisters. There was Dexter--so like\r\nhim!--hopping about on his hands (did you ever see it? the most\r\ngrotesquely horrible exhibition you can imagine!)--there was Dexter,\r\nhopping about, and looking through keyholes, evidently in search of the\r\nperson who had left her room at two in the morning; and no doubt taking\r\nPhoebe for her mistress, seeing that she had forgotten to take her\r\nmistress\'s cloak off her shoulders. The next morning, early, Helena came\r\nback in a hired carriage from Edinburgh, with a hat and mantle borrowed\r\nfrom her English friends. She left the carriage in the road, and got\r\ninto the house by way of the garden--without being discovered, this\r\ntime, by Dexter or by anybody. Clever and daring, wasn\'t it? And, as\r\nI said just now, quite a new version of the \'Domino Noir.\' You will\r\nwonder, as I did, how it was that Dexter didn\'t make mischief in the\r\nmorning? He would have done it no doubt. But even he was silenced (as\r\nPhoebe told me) by the dreadful event that happened in the house on the\r\nsame day. My dear Mrs. Woodville! the heat of this room is certainly too\r\nmuch for you, take my smelling-bottle. Let me open the window."\r\n\r\nI was just able to answer, "Pray say nothing! Let me slip out into the\r\nopen air!"\r\n\r\nI made my way unobserved to the landing, and sat down on the stairs to\r\ncompose myself where nobody could see me. In a moment more I felt a hand\r\nlaid gently on my shoulder, and discovered good Benjamin looking at\r\nme in dismay. Lady Clarinda had considerately spoken to him, and had\r\nassisted him in quietly making his retreat from the room, while his\r\nhost\'s attention was still absorbed by the music.\r\n\r\n"My dear child!" he whispered, "what is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Take me home, and I will tell you," was all that I could say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. A SPECIMEN OF MY WISDOM.\r\n\r\nTHE scene must follow my erratic movements--the scene must close on\r\nLondon for a while, and open in Edinburgh. Two days had passed since\r\nMajor Fitz-David\'s dinner-party. I was able to breathe again freely,\r\nafter the utter destruction of all my plans for the future, and of all\r\nthe hopes that I had founded on them. I could now see that I had been\r\ntrebly in the wrong--wrong in hastily and cruelly suspecting an innocent\r\nwoman; wrong in communicating my suspicions (without an attempt to\r\nverify them previously) to another person; wrong in accepting the\r\nflighty inferences and conclusions of Miserrimus Dexter as if they had\r\nbeen solid truths. I was so ashamed of my folly, when I thought of the\r\npast--so completely discouraged, so rudely shaken in my confidence\r\nin myself, when I thought of the future, that, for once in a way, I\r\naccepted sensible advice when it was offered to me. "My dear," said good\r\nold Benjamin, after we had thoroughly talked over my discomfiture on\r\nour return from the dinner-party, "judging by what you tell me of him,\r\nI don\'t fancy Mr. Dexter. Promise me that you will not go back to him\r\nuntil you have first consulted some person who is fitter to guide you\r\nthrough this dangerous business than I am."\r\n\r\nI gave him my promise, on one condition. "If I fail to find the person,"\r\nI said, "will you undertake to help me?"\r\n\r\nBenjamin pledged himself to help me, cheerfully.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when I was brushing my hair, and thinking over my\r\naffairs, I called to mind a forgotten resolution of mine at the time I\r\nfirst read the Report of my husband\'s Trial. I mean the resolution--if\r\nMiserrimus Dexter failed me--to apply to one of the two agents\r\n(or solicitors, as we should term them) who had prepared Eustace\'s\r\ndefense--namely, Mr. Playmore. This gentleman, it may be remembered,\r\nhad especially recommended himself to my confidence by his friendly\r\ninterference when the sheriff\'s officers were in search of my husband\'s\r\npapers. Referring back to the evidence Of "Isaiah Schoolcraft," I found\r\nthat Mr. Playmore had been called in to assist and advise Eustace by\r\nMiserrimus Dexter. He was therefore not only a friend on whom I might\r\nrely, but a friend who was personally acquainted with Dexter as well.\r\nCould there be a fitter man to apply to for enlightenment in the\r\ndarkness that had now gathered around me? Benjamin, when I put the\r\nquestion to him, acknowledged that I had made a sensible choice on this\r\noccasion, and at once exerted himself to help me. He discovered (through\r\nhis own lawyer) the address of Mr. Playmore\'s London agents; and from\r\nthese gentlemen he obtained for me a letter of introduction to Mr.\r\nPlaymore himself. I had nothing to conceal from my new adviser; and I\r\nwas properly described in the letter as Eustace Macallan\'s second wife.\r\n\r\nThe same evening we two set forth (Benjamin refused to let me travel\r\nalone) by the night mail for Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nI had previously written to Miserrimus Dexter (by my old friend\'s\r\nadvice), merely saying that I had been unexpectedly called away from\r\nLondon for a few days, and that I would report to him the result of my\r\ninterview with Lady Clarinda on my return. A characteristic answer was\r\nbrought back to the cottage by Ariel: "Mrs. Valeria, I happen to be a\r\nman of quick perceptions; and I can read the _unwritten_ part of your\r\nletter. Lady Clarinda has shaken your confidence in me. Very good. I\r\npledge myself to shake your confidence in Lady Clarinda. In the meantime\r\nI am not offended. In serene composure I await the honor and the\r\nhappiness of your visit. Send me word by telegraph whether you would\r\nlike Truffles again, or whether you would prefer something simpler and\r\nlighter--say that incomparable French dish, Pig\'s Eyelids and Tamarinds.\r\nBelieve me always your ally and admirer, your poet and cook--DEXTER."\r\n\r\nArrived in Edinburgh, Benjamin and I had a little discussion. The\r\nquestion in dispute between us was whether I should go with him, or go\r\nalone, to Mr. Playmore. I was all for going alone.\r\n\r\n"My experience of the world is not a very large one," I said. "But\r\nI have observed that, in nine cases out of ten, a man will make\r\nconcessions to a woman, if she approaches him by her self, which he\r\nwould hesitate even to consider if another man was within hearing. I\r\ndon\'t know how it is--I only know that it is so; If I find that I get on\r\nbadly with Mr. Playmore, I will ask him for a second appointment, and,\r\nin that case, you shall accompany me. Don\'t think me self-willed. Let me\r\ntry my luck alone, and let us see what comes of it."\r\n\r\nBenjamin yielded, with his customary consideration for me. I sent my\r\nletter of introduction to Mr. Playmore\'s office--his private house being\r\nin the neighborhood of Gleninch. My messenger brought back a polite\r\nanswer, inviting me to visit him at an early hour in the afternoon. At\r\nthe appointed time, to the moment, I rang the bell at the office door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. A SPECIMEN OF MY FOLLY.\r\n\r\nTHE incomprehensible submission of Scotchmen to the ecclesiastical\r\ntyranny of their Established Church has produced--not unnaturally, as\r\nI think--a very mistaken impression of the national character in the\r\npopular mind.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion looks at the institution of "The Sabbath" in Scotland;\r\nfinds it unparalleled in Christendom for its senseless and savage\r\nausterity; sees a nation content to be deprived by its priesthood of\r\nevery social privilege on one day in every week--forbidden to travel;\r\nforbidden to telegraph; forbidden to eat a hot dinner; forbidden to\r\nread a newspaper; in short, allowed the use of two liberties only,\r\nthe liberty of exhibiting one\'s self at the Church and the liberty of\r\nsecluding one\'s self over the bottle--public opinion sees this, and\r\narrives at the not unreasonable conclusion that the people who submit to\r\nsuch social laws as these are the most stolid, stern and joyless people\r\non the face of the earth. Such are Scotchmen supposed to be, when viewed\r\nat a distance. But how do Scotchmen appear when they are seen under a\r\ncloser light, and judged by the test of personal experience? There\r\nare no people more cheerful, more companionable, more hospitable, more\r\nliberal in their ideas, to be found on the face of the civilized globe\r\nthan the very people who submit to the Scotch Sunday! On the six days\r\nof the week there is an atmosphere of quiet humor, a radiation of genial\r\ncommon-sense, about Scotchmen in general, which is simply delightful\r\nto feel. But on the seventh day these same men will hear one of their\r\nministers seriously tell them that he views taking a walk on the Sabbath\r\nin the light of an act of profanity, and will be the only people in\r\nexistence who can let a man talk downright nonsense without laughing at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI am not clever enough to be able to account for this anomaly in the\r\nnational character; I can only notice it by way of necessary preparation\r\nfor the appearance in my little narrative of a personage not frequently\r\nseen in writing--a cheerful Scotchman.\r\n\r\nIn all other respects I found Mr. Playmore only negatively remarkable.\r\nHe was neither old nor young, neither handsome nor ugly; he was\r\npersonally not in the least like the popular idea of a lawyer; and he\r\nspoke perfectly good English, touched with only the slightest possible\r\nflavor of a Scotch accent.\r\n\r\n"I have the honor to be an old friend of Mr. Macallan," he said,\r\ncordially shaking hands with me; "and I am honestly happy to become\r\nacquainted with Mr. Macallan\'s wife. Where will you sit? Near the light?\r\nYou are young enough not to be afraid of the daylight just yet. Is this\r\nyour first visit to Edinburgh? Pray let me make it as pleasant to you\r\nas I can. I shall be delighted to present Mrs. Playmore to you. We are\r\nstaying in Edinburgh for a little while. The Italian opera is here, and\r\nwe have a box for to-night. Will you kindly waive all ceremony and dine\r\nwith us and go to the music afterward?"\r\n\r\n"You are very kind," I answered. "But I have some anxieties just now\r\nwhich will make me a very poor companion for Mrs. Playmore at the opera.\r\nMy letter to you mentions, I think, that I have to ask your advice on\r\nmatters which are of very serious importance to me."\r\n\r\n"Does it?" he rejoined. "To tell you the truth, I have not read the\r\nletter through. I saw your name in it, and I gathered from your message\r\nthat you wished to see me here. I sent my note to your hotel--and then\r\nwent on with something else. Pray pardon me. Is this a professional\r\nconsultation? For your own sake, I sincerely hope not!"\r\n\r\n"It is hardly a professional consultation, Mr. Playmore. I find myself\r\nin a very painful position; and I come to you to advise me, under very\r\nunusual circumstances. I shall surprise you very much when you hear what\r\nI have to say; and I am afraid I shall occupy more than my fair share of\r\nyour time."\r\n\r\n"I and my time are entirely at your disposal," he said. "Tell me what I\r\ncan do for you--and tell it in your own way."\r\n\r\nThe kindness of this language was more than matched by the kindness of\r\nhis manner. I spoke to him freely and fully--I told him my strange story\r\nwithout the slightest reserve.\r\n\r\nHe showed the varying impressions that I produced on his mind without\r\nthe slightest concealment. My separation from Eustace distressed him.\r\nMy resolution to dispute the Scotch Verdict, and my unjust suspicions\r\nof Mrs. Beauly, first amused, then surprised him. It was not, however,\r\nuntil I had described my extraordinary interview with Miserrimus Dexter,\r\nand my hardly less remarkable conversation with Lady Clarinda, that I\r\nproduced my greatest effect on the lawyer\'s mind. I saw him change color\r\nfor the first time. He started, and muttered to himself, as if he\r\nhad completely forgotten me. "Good God!" I heard him say--"can it be\r\npossible? Does the truth lie _that_ way after all?"\r\n\r\nI took the liberty of interrupting him. I had no idea of allowing him to\r\nkeep his thoughts to himself.\r\n\r\n"I seem to have surprised you?" I said.\r\n\r\nHe started at the sound of my voice.\r\n\r\n"I beg ten thousand pardons!" he exclaimed. "You have not only\r\nsurprised me--you have opened an entirely new view to my mind. I see\r\na possibility, a really startling possibility, in connection with the\r\npoisoning at Gleninch, which never occurred to me until the present\r\nmoment. This is a nice state of things," he added, falling back again\r\ninto his ordinary humor. "Here is the client leading the lawyer. My dear\r\nMrs. Eustace, which is it--do you want my advice? or do I want yours?"\r\n\r\n"May I hear the new idea?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Not just yet, if you will excuse me," he answered. "Make allowances for\r\nmy professional caution. I don\'t want to be professional with you--my\r\ngreat anxiety is to avoid it. But the lawyer gets the better of the\r\nman, and refuses to be suppressed. I really hesitate to realize what\r\nis passing in my own mind without some further inquiry. Do me a great\r\nfavor. Let us go over a part of the ground again, and let me ask you\r\nsome questions as we proceed. Do you feel any objection to obliging me\r\nin this matter?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, Mr. Playmore. How far shall we go back?"\r\n\r\n"To your visit to Dexter with your mother-in-law. When you first asked\r\nhim if he had any ideas of his own on the subject of Mrs. Eustace\r\nMacallan\'s death, did I understand you to say that he looked at you\r\nsuspiciously?"\r\n\r\n"Very suspiciously."\r\n\r\n"And his face cleared up again when you told him that your question was\r\nonly suggested by what you had read in the Report of the Trial?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nHe drew a slip of paper out of the drawer in his desk, dipped his pen\r\nin the ink, considered a little, and placed a chair for me close at his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"The lawyer disappears," he said, "and the man resumes his proper place.\r\nThere shall be no professional mysteries between you and me. As your\r\nhusband\'s old friend, Mrs. Eustace, I feel no common interest in you. I\r\nsee a serious necessity for warning you before it is too late; and I can\r\nonly do so to any good purpose by running a risk on which few men in my\r\nplace would venture. Personally and professionally, I am going to trust\r\nyou--though I _am_ a Scotchman and a lawyer. Sit here, and look over my\r\nshoulder while I make my notes. You will see what is passing in my mind\r\nif you see what I write."\r\n\r\nI sat down by him, and looked over his shoulder, without the smallest\r\npretense of hesitation.\r\n\r\nHe began to write as follows:\r\n\r\n"The poisoning at Gleninch. Queries: In what position does Miserrimus\r\nDexter stand toward the poisoning? And what does he (presumably) know\r\nabout that matter?\r\n\r\n"He has ideas which are secrets. He suspects that he has betrayed them,\r\nor that they have been discovered in some way inconceivable to himself.\r\nHe is palpably relieved when he finds that this is not the case."\r\n\r\nThe pen stopped; and the questions went on.\r\n\r\n"Let us advance to your second visit," said Mr. Playmore, "when you\r\nsaw Dexter alone. Tell me again what he did, and how he looked when you\r\ninformed him that you were not satisfied with the Scotch Verdict."\r\n\r\nI repeated what I have already written in these pages. The pen went back\r\nto the paper again, and added these lines:\r\n\r\n"He hears nothing more remarkable than that a person visiting him, who\r\nis interested in the case, refuses to accept the verdict at the Macallan\r\nTrial as a final verdict, and proposes to reopen the inquiry. What does\r\nhe do upon that?\r\n\r\n"He exhibits all the symptoms of a panic of terror; he sees himself in\r\nsome incomprehensible danger; he is frantic at one moment and servile\r\nat the next; he must and will know what this disturbing person really\r\nmeans. And when he is informed on that point, he first turns pale and\r\ndoubts the evidence of his own senses; and next, with nothing said to\r\njustify it, gratuitously accuses his visitor of suspecting somebody.\r\nQuery here: When a small sum of money is missing in a household, and\r\nthe servants in general are called together to be informed of the\r\ncircumstance, what do we think of the one servant in particular who\r\nspeaks first, and who says, \'Do you suspect _me?_\'"\r\n\r\nHe laid down the pen again. "Is that right?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI began to see the end to which the notes were drifting. Instead of\r\nanswering his question, I entreated him to enter into the explanations\r\nthat were still wanting to convince my own mind. He held up a warning\r\nforefinger, and stopped me.\r\n\r\n"Not yet," he said. "Once again, am I right--so far?"\r\n\r\n"Quite right."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Now tell me what happened next. Don\'t mind repeating\r\nyourself. Give me all the details, one after another, to the end."\r\n\r\nI mentioned all the details exactly as I remembered them. Mr. Playmore\r\nreturned to his writing for the third and last time. Thus the notes\r\nended:\r\n\r\n"He is indirectly assured that he at least is not the person suspected.\r\nHe sinks back in his chair; he draws a long breath; he asks to be left a\r\nwhile by himself, under the pretense that the subject excites him.\r\nWhen the visitor returns, Dexter has been drinking in the interval. The\r\nvisitor resumes the subject--not Dexter. The visitor is convinced that\r\nMrs. Eustace Macallan died by the hand of a poisoner, and openly says\r\nso. Dexter sinks back in his chair like a man fainting. What is the\r\nhorror that has got possession of him? It is easy to understand if we\r\ncall it guilty horror; it is beyond all understanding if we call it\r\nanything else. And how does it leave him? He flies from one extreme,\r\nto another; he is indescribably delighted when he discovers that the\r\nvisitor\'s suspicions are all fixed on an absent person. And then, and\r\nthen only, he takes refuge in the declaration that he has been of one\r\nmind with his visitor, in the matter of suspicion, from the first. These\r\nare facts. To what plain conclusion do they point?"\r\n\r\nHe shut up his notes, and, steadily watching my face, waited for me to\r\nspeak first.\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Mr. Playmore," I beg impetuously. "You believe that\r\nMr. Dexter--"\r\n\r\nHis warning forefinger stopped me there.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," he interposed, "what Dexter said to you when he was so good as\r\nto confirm your opinion of poor Mrs. Beauly."\r\n\r\n"He said, \'There isn\'t a doubt about it. Mrs. Beauly poisoned her.\'"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do better than follow so good an example--with one trifling\r\ndifference. I say too, There isn\'t a doubt about it. Dexter poisoned\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Are you joking, Mr. Playmore?"\r\n\r\n"I never was more in earnest in my life. Your rash visit to Dexter, and\r\nyour extraordinary imprudence in taking him into your confidence have\r\nled to astonishing results. The light which the whole machinery of\r\nthe Law was unable to throw on the poisoning case at Gleninch has been\r\naccidentally let in on it by a Lady who refuses to listen to reason and\r\nwho insists on having her own way. Quite incredible, and nevertheless\r\nquite true."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"What is impossible?" he asked, coolly\r\n\r\n"That Dexter poisoned my husband\'s first wife."\r\n\r\n"And why is that impossible, if you please?" I began to be almost\r\nenraged with Mr. Playmore.\r\n\r\n"Can you ask the question?" I replied, indignantly. "I have told you\r\nthat I heard him speak of her in terms of respect and affection of\r\nwhich any woman might be proud. He lives in the memory of her. I owe his\r\nfriendly reception of me to some resemblance which he fancies he sees\r\nbetween my figure and hers. I have seen tears in his eyes, I have heard\r\nhis voice falter and fail him, when he spoke of her. He may be the\r\nfalsest of men in all besides, but he is true to _her_--he has not\r\nmisled me in that one thing. There are signs that never deceive a woman\r\nwhen a man is talking to her of what is really near his heart: I saw\r\nthose signs. It is as true that I poisoned her as that he did. I am\r\nashamed to set my opinion against yours, Mr. Playmore; but I really\r\ncannot help it. I declare I am almost angry with you."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be pleased, instead of offended by the bold manner in which\r\nI expressed myself.\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Eustace, you have no reason to be angry with me. In one\r\nrespect, I entirely share your view--with this difference, that I go a\r\nlittle further than you do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you."\r\n\r\n"You will understand me directly. You describe Dexter\'s feeling for the\r\nlate Mrs. Eustace as a happy mixture of respect and affection. I can\r\ntell you it was a much warmer feeling toward her than that. I have\r\nmy information from the poor lady herself--who honored me with her\r\nconfidence and friendship for the best part of her life. Before she\r\nmarried Mr. Macallan--she kept it a secret from him, and you had better\r\nkeep it a secret too--Miserrimus Dexter was in love with her. Miserrimus\r\nDexter asked her--deformed as he was, seriously asked her--to be his\r\nwife."\r\n\r\n"And in the face of that," I cried, "you say that he poisoned her!"\r\n\r\n"I do. I see no other conclusion possible, after what happened during\r\nyour visit to him. You all but frightened him into a fainting fit. What\r\nwas he afraid of?"\r\n\r\nI tried hard to find an answer to that. I even embarked on an answer\r\nwithout quite knowing where my own words might lead me.\r\n\r\nMr. Dexter is an old and true friend of my husband, I began. "When he\r\nheard me say I was not satisfied with the Verdict, he might have felt\r\nalarmed--"\r\n\r\n"He might have felt alarmed at the possible consequences to your husband\r\nof reopening the inquiry," said Mr. Playmore, ironically finishing\r\nthe sentence for me. "Rather far-fetched, Mrs. Eustace; and not very\r\nconsistent with your faith in your husband\'s innocence. Clear your mind\r\nof one mistake," he continued, seriously, "which may fatally mislead you\r\nif you persist in pursuing your present course. Miserrimus Dexter, you\r\nmay take my word for it, ceased to be your husband\'s friend on the\r\nday when your husband married his first wife. Dexter has kept up\r\nappearances, I grant you, both in public and in private. His evidence\r\nin his friend\'s favor at the Trial was given with the deep feeling which\r\neverybody expected from him. Nevertheless, I firmly believe, looking\r\nunder the surface, that Mr. Macallan has no bitterer enemy living than\r\nMiserrimus Dexter."\r\n\r\nHe turned me cold. I felt that here, at least, he was right. My husband\r\nhad wooed and won the woman who had refused Dexter\'s offer of marriage.\r\nWas Dexter the man to forgive that? My own experience answered me, and\r\nsaid, No. "Bear in mind what I have told you," Mr. Playmore proceeded.\r\n"And now let us get on to your own position in this matter, and to the\r\ninterests that you have at stake. Try to adopt my point of view for the\r\nmoment; and let us inquire what chance we have of making any further\r\nadvance toward a discovery of the truth. It is one thing to be morally\r\nconvinced (as I am) that Miserrimus Dexter is the man who ought to have\r\nbeen tried for the murder at Gleninch; and it is another thing, at this\r\ndistance of time, to lay our hands on the plain evidence which can alone\r\njustify anything like a public assertion of his guilt. There, as I see\r\nit, is the insuperable difficulty in the case. Unless I am completely\r\nmistaken, the question is now narrowed to this plain issue: The public\r\nassertion of your husband\'s innocence depends entirely on the public\r\nassertion of Dexter\'s guilt. How are you to arrive at that result? There\r\nis not a particle of evidence against him. You can only convict Dexter\r\non Dexter\'s own confession. Are you listening to me?"\r\n\r\nI was listening, most unwillingly. If he were right, things had indeed\r\ncome to that terrible pass. But I could not--with all my respect for his\r\nsuperior knowledge and experience--I could not persuade myself that he\r\n_was_ right. And I owned it, with the humility which I really felt.\r\n\r\nHe smiled good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n"At any rate," he said, "you will admit that Dexter has not freely\r\nopened his mind to you thus far? He is still keeping something from your\r\nknowledge which you are interested in discovering?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I admit that."\r\n\r\n"Very good. What applies to your view of the case applies to mine. I\r\nsay, he is keeping from you the confession of his guilt. You say, he is\r\nkeeping from you information which may fasten the guilt on some other\r\nperson. Let us start from that point. Confession, or information, how\r\nare you to get at what he is now withholding from you? What influence\r\ncan you bring to bear on him when you see him again?"\r\n\r\n"Surely I might persuade him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. And if persuasion fail--what then? Do you think you can\r\nentrap him into speaking out? or terrify him into speaking out?"\r\n\r\n"If you will look at your notes, Mr. Playmore, you will see that I have\r\nalready succeeded in terrifying him--though I am only a woman and though\r\nI didn\'t mean to do it."\r\n\r\n"Very well answered. You mark the trick. What you have done once\r\nyou think you can do again. Well, as you are determined to try the\r\nexperiment, it can do you no harm to know a little more of Dexter\'s\r\ncharacter and temperament than you know now. Suppose we apply for\r\ninformation to somebody who can help us?"\r\n\r\nI started, and looked round the room. He made me do it--he spoke as if\r\nthe person who was to help us was close at our elbows.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be alarmed," he said. "The oracle is silent; and the oracle is\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nHe unlocked one of the drawers of his desk; produced a bundle of\r\nletters, and picked out one.\r\n\r\n"When we were arranging your husband\'s defense," he said, "we felt some\r\ndifficulty about including Miserrimus Dexter among our witnesses. We had\r\nnot the slightest suspicion of him, I need hardly tell you. But we were\r\nall afraid of his eccentricity; and some among us even feared that the\r\nexcitement of appearing at the Trial might drive him completely out of\r\nhis mind. In this emergency we applied to a doctor to help us. Under\r\nsome pretext, which I forget now, we introduced him to Dexter. And in\r\ndue course of time we received his report. Here it is."\r\n\r\nHe opened the letter, and marking a certain passage in it with a pencil,\r\nhanded it to me.\r\n\r\n"Read the lines which I have marked," he said; "they will be quite\r\nsufficient for our purpose."\r\n\r\nI read these words:\r\n\r\n"Summing up the results of my observation, I may give it as my opinion\r\nthat there is undoubtedly latent insanity in this case, but that no\r\nactive symptoms of madness have presented themselves as yet. You may,\r\nI think, produce him at the Trial, without fear of consequences. He\r\nmay say and do all sorts of odd things; but he has his mind under the\r\ncontrol of his will, and you may trust his self-esteem to exhibit him in\r\nthe character of a substantially intelligent witness.\r\n\r\n"As to the future, I am, of course, not able to speak positively. I can\r\nonly state my views.\r\n\r\n"That he will end in madness (if he live), I entertain little or no\r\ndoubt. The question of _when_ the madness will show itself depends\r\nentirely on the state of his health. His nervous system is highly\r\nsensitive, and there are signs that his way of life has already damaged\r\nit. If he conquer the bad habits to which I have alluded in an earlier\r\npart of my report, and if he pass many hours of every day quietly in the\r\nopen air, he may last as a sane man for years to come. If he persist in\r\nhis present way of life--or, in other words, if further mischief\r\noccur to that sensitive nervous system--his lapse into insanity must\r\ninfallibly take place when the mischief has reached its culminating\r\npoint. Without warning to himself or to others, the whole mental\r\nstructure will give way; and, at a moment\'s notice, while he is acting\r\nas quietly or speaking as intelligently as at his best time, the man\r\nwill drop (if I may use the expression) into madness or idiocy. In\r\neither case, when the catastrophe has happened, it is only due to his\r\nfriends to add that they can (as I believe) entertain no hope of his\r\ncure. The balance once lost, will be lost for life."\r\n\r\nThere it ended. Mr. Playmore put the letter back in his drawer.\r\n\r\n"You have just read the opinion of one of our highest living\r\nauthorities," he said. "Does Dexter strike you as a likely man to give\r\nhis nervous system a chance of recovery? Do you see no obstacles and no\r\nperils in your way?"\r\n\r\nMy silence answered him.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you go back to Dexter," he proceeded. "And suppose that the\r\ndoctor\'s opinion exaggerates the peril in his case. What are you to do?\r\nThe last time you saw him, you had the immense advantage of taking him\r\nby surprise. Those sensitive nerves of his gave way, and he betrayed the\r\nfear that you aroused in him. Can you take him by surprise again? Not\r\nyou! He is prepared for you now; and he will be on his guard. If you\r\nencounter nothing worse, you will have his cunning to deal with\r\nnext. Are you his match at that? But for Lady Clarinda he would have\r\nhopelessly misled you on the subject of Mrs. Beauly."\r\n\r\nThere was no answering this, either. I was foolish enough to try to\r\nanswer it, for all that.\r\n\r\n"He told me the truth so far as he knew it," I rejoined. "He really saw\r\nwhat he said he saw in the corridor at Gleninch."\r\n\r\n"He told you the truth," returned Mr. Playmore, "because he was\r\ncunning enough to see that the truth would help him in irritating your\r\nsuspicions. You don\'t really believe that he shared your suspicions?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" I said. "He was as ignorant of what Mrs. Beauly was really\r\ndoing on that night as I was--until I met Lady Clarinda. It remains to\r\nbe seen whether he will not be as much astonished as I was when I tell\r\nhim what Lady Clarinda told me."\r\n\r\nThis smart reply produced an effect which I had not anticipated.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, Mr. Playmore abruptly dropped all further discussion\r\non his side. He appeared to despair of convincing me, and he owned it\r\nindirectly in his next words.\r\n\r\n"Will nothing that I can say to you," he asked, "induce you to think as\r\nI think in this matter?"\r\n\r\n"I have not your ability or your experience," I answered. "I am sorry to\r\nsay I can\'t think as you think."\r\n\r\n"And you are really determined to see Miserrimus Dexter again?"\r\n\r\n"I have engaged myself to see him again."\r\n\r\nHe waited a little, and thought over it.\r\n\r\n"You have honored me by asking for my advice," he said. "I earnestly\r\nadvise you, Mrs. Eustace, to break your engagement. I go even further\r\nthan that--I _entreat_ you not to see Dexter again."\r\n\r\nJust what my mother-in-law had said! just what Benjamin and Major\r\nFitz-David had said! They were all against me. And still I held out.\r\n\r\nI wonder, when I look back at it, at my own obstinacy. I am almost\r\nashamed to relate that I made Mr. Playmore no reply. He waited, still\r\nlooking at me. I felt irritated by that fixed look. I arose, and stood\r\nbefore him with my eyes on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe arose in his turn. He understood that the conference was over.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," he said, with a kind of sad good-humor, "I suppose it is\r\nunreasonable of me to expect that a young woman like you should share\r\nany opinion with an old lawyer like me. Let me only remind you that our\r\nconversation must remain strictly confidential for the present; and then\r\nlet us change the subject. Is there anything that I can do for you? Are\r\nyou alone in Edinburgh?"\r\n\r\n"No. I am traveling with an old friend of mine, who has known me from\r\nchildhood."\r\n\r\n"And do you stay here to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"Will you do me one favor? Will you think over what has passed between\r\nus, and will you come back to me in the morning?"\r\n\r\n"Willingly, Mr. Playmore, if it is only to thank you again for your\r\nkindness."\r\n\r\nOn that understanding we parted. He sighed--the cheerful man sighed, as\r\nhe opened the door for me. Women are contradictory creatures. That sigh\r\naffected me more than all his arguments. I felt myself blush for my own\r\nhead-strong resistance to him as I took my leave and turned away into\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. GLENINCH.\r\n\r\n"AHA!" said Benjamin, complacently. "So the lawyer thinks, as I do,\r\nthat you will be highly imprudent if you go back to Mr. Dexter? A\r\nhard-headed, sensible man the lawyer, no doubt. You will listen to Mr.\r\nPlaymore, won\'t you, though you wouldn\'t listen to me?"\r\n\r\n(I had of course respected Mr. Playmore\'s confidence in me when Benjamin\r\nand I met on my return to the hotel. Not a word relating to the lawyer\'s\r\nhorrible suspicion of Miserrimus Dexter had passed my lips.)\r\n\r\n"You must forgive me, my old friend," I said, answering Benjamin. "I\r\nam afraid it has come to this--try as I may, I can listen to nobody\r\nwho advises me. On our way here I honestly meant to be guided by Mr.\r\nPlaymore--we should never have taken this long journey if I had\r\nnot honestly meant it. I have tried, tried hard to be a teachable,\r\nreasonable woman. But there is something in me that won\'t be taught. I\r\nam afraid I shall go back to Dexter."\r\n\r\nEven Benjamin lost all patience with me this time.\r\n\r\n"What is bred in the bone," he said, quoting the old proverb, "will\r\nnever come out of the flesh. In years gone by, you were the most\r\nobstinate child that ever made a mess in a nursery. Oh, dear me, we\r\nmight as well have stayed in London."\r\n\r\n"No," I replied, "now we have traveled to Edinburgh, we will see\r\nsomething (interesting to _me_ at any rate) which we should never have\r\nseen if we had not left London. My husband\'s country-house is within a\r\nfew miles of us here. To-morrow--we will go to Gleninch."\r\n\r\n"Where the poor lady was poisoned?" asked Benjamin, with a look of\r\ndismay. "You mean that place?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I want to see the room in which she died; I want to go all over\r\nthe house."\r\n\r\nBenjamin crossed his hands resignedly on his lap. "I try to understand\r\nthe new generation," said the old man, sadly; "but I can\'t manage it.\r\nThe new generation beats me."\r\n\r\nI sat down to write to Mr. Playmore about the visit to Gleninch. The\r\nhouse in which the tragedy had occurred that had blighted my husband\'s\r\nlife was, to my mind, the most interesting house on the habitable globe.\r\nThe prospect of visiting Gleninch had, indeed (to tell the truth),\r\nstrongly influenced my resolution to consult the Edinburgh lawyer. I\r\nsent my note to Mr. Playmore by a messenger, and received the kindest\r\nreply in return. If I would wait until the afternoon, he would get the\r\nday\'s business done, and would take us to Gleninch in his own carriage.\r\n\r\nBenjamin\'s obstinacy--in its own quiet way, and on certain occasions\r\nonly--was quite a match for mine. He had privately determined, as one of\r\nthe old generation, to have nothing to do with Gleninch. Not a word on\r\nthe subject escaped him until Mr. Playmore\'s carriage was at the hotel\r\ndoor. At that appropriate moment Benjamin remembered an old friend of\r\nhis in Edinburgh. "Will you please to excuse me, Valeria? My friend\'s\r\nname is Saunders; and he will take it unkindly of me if I don\'t dine\r\nwith him to-day."\r\n\r\nApart from the associations that I connected with it, there was nothing\r\nto interest a traveler at Gleninch.\r\n\r\nThe country around was pretty and well cultivated, and nothing more.\r\nThe park was, to an English eye, wild and badly kept. The house had been\r\nbuilt within the last seventy or eighty years. Outside, it was as bare\r\nof all ornament as a factory, and as gloomily heavy in effect as a\r\nprison. Inside, the deadly dreariness, the close, oppressive solitude\r\nof a deserted dwelling wearied the eye and weighed on the mind, from the\r\nroof to the basement. The house had been shut up since the time of the\r\nTrial. A lonely old couple, man and wife, had the keys and the charge\r\nof it. The man shook his head in silent and sorrowful disapproval of our\r\nintrusion when Mr. Playmore ordered him to open the doors and shutters,\r\nand let the light in on the dark, deserted place. Fires were burning\r\nin the library and the picture-gallery, to preserve the treasures which\r\nthey contained from the damp. It was not easy, at first, to look at the\r\ncheerful blaze without fancying that the inhabitants of the house must\r\nsurely come in and warm themselves. Ascending to the upper floor, I saw\r\nthe rooms made familiar to me by the Report of the Trial. I entered\r\nthe little study, with the old books on the shelves, and the key still\r\nmissing from the locked door of communication with the bedchamber.\r\nI looked into the room in which the unhappy mistress of Gleninch had\r\nsuffered and died. The bed was left in its place; the sofa on which the\r\nnurse had snatched her intervals of repose was at its foot; the Indian\r\ncabinet, in which the crumpled paper with the grains of arsenic had been\r\nfound, still held its little collection of curiosities. I moved on its\r\npivot the invalid-table on which she had taken her meals and written her\r\npoems, poor soul. The place was dreary and dreadful; the heavy air\r\nfelt as if it were still burdened with its horrid load of misery and\r\ndistrust. I was glad to get out (after a passing glance at the room\r\nwhich Eustace had occupied in those days) into the Guests\' Corridor.\r\nThere was the bedroom, at the door of which Miserrimus Dexter had waited\r\nand watched. There was the oaken floor along which he had hopped, in his\r\nhorrible way, following the footsteps of the servant disguised in her\r\nmistress\'s clothes. Go where I might, the ghosts of the dead and the\r\nabsent were with me, step by step. Go where I might, the lonely horror\r\nof the house had its still and awful voice for Me: "_I_ keep the secret\r\nof the Poison! _I_ hide the mystery of the death!"\r\n\r\nThe oppression of the place became unendurable. I longed for the pure\r\nsky and the free air. My companion noticed and understood me.\r\n\r\n"Come," he said. "We have had enough of the house. Let us look at the\r\ngrounds."\r\n\r\nIn the gray quiet of the evening we roamed about the lonely gardens, and\r\nthreaded our way through the rank, neglected shrubberies. Wandering here\r\nand wandering there, we drifted into the kitchen garden--with one little\r\npatch still sparely cultivated by the old man and his wife, and all the\r\nrest a wilderness of weeds. Beyond the far end of the garden, divided\r\nfrom it by a low paling of wood, there stretched a patch of waste\r\nground, sheltered on three sides by trees. In one lost corner of the\r\nground an object, common enough elsewhere, attracted my attention\r\nhere. The object was a dust-heap. The great size of it, and the curious\r\nsituation in which it was placed, aroused a moment\'s languid curiosity\r\nin me. I stopped, and looked at the dust and ashes, at the broken\r\ncrockery and the old iron. Here there was a torn hat, and there some\r\nfragments of rotten old boots, and scattered around a small attendant\r\nlitter of torn paper and frowzy rags.\r\n\r\n"What are you looking at?" asked Mr. Playmore.\r\n\r\n"At nothing more remarkable than the dust-heap," I answered.\r\n\r\n"In tidy England, I suppose, you would have all that carted away out\r\nof sight," said the lawyer. "We don\'t mind in Scotland, as long as the\r\ndust-heap is far enough away not to be smelt at the house. Besides,\r\nsome of it, sifted, comes in usefully as manure for the garden. Here\r\nthe place is deserted, and the rubbish in consequence has not been\r\ndisturbed. Everything at Gleninch, Mrs. Eustace (the big dust-heap\r\nincluded), is waiting for the new mistress to set it to rights. One of\r\nthese days you may be queen here--who knows?"\r\n\r\n"I shall never see this place again," I said.\r\n\r\n"Never is a long day," returned my companion. "And time has its\r\nsurprises in store for all of us."\r\n\r\nWe turned away, and walked back in silence to the park gate, at which\r\nthe carriage was waiting.\r\n\r\nOn the return to Edinburgh, Mr. Playmore directed the conversation to\r\ntopics entirely unconnected with my visit to Gleninch. He saw that\r\nmy mind stood in need of relief; and he most good-naturedly, and\r\nsuccessfully, exerted himself to amuse me. It was not until we were\r\nclose to the city that he touched on the subject of my return to London.\r\n\r\n"Have you decided yet on the day when you leave Edinburgh?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"We leave Edinburgh," I replied, "by the train of to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"Do you still see no reason to alter the opinions which you expressed\r\nyesterday? Does your speedy departure mean that?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it does, Mr. Playmore. When I am an older woman, I may be\r\na wiser woman. In the meantime, I can only trust to your indulgence if I\r\nstill blindly blunder on in my own way."\r\n\r\nHe smiled pleasantly, and patted my hand--then changed on a sudden, and\r\nlooked at me gravely and attentively before he opened his lips again.\r\n\r\n"This is my last opportunity of speaking to you before you go," he said.\r\n"May I speak freely?"\r\n\r\n"As freely as you please, Mr. Playmore. Whatever you may say to me will\r\nonly add to my grateful sense of your kindness."\r\n\r\n"I have very little to say, Mrs. Eustace--and that little begins with\r\na word of caution. You told me yesterday that, when you paid your last\r\nvisit to Miserrimus Dexter, you went to him alone. Don\'t do that again.\r\nTake somebody with you."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I am in any danger, then?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the ordinary sense of the word. I only think that a friend may\r\nbe useful in keeping Dexter\'s audacity (he is one of the most impudent\r\nmen living) within proper limits. Then, again, in case anything worth\r\nremembering and acting on _should_ fall from him in his talk, a friend\r\nmay be valuable as witness. In your place, I should have a witness with\r\nme who could take notes--but then I am a lawyer, and my business is to\r\nmake a fuss about trifles. Let me only say--go with a companion when you\r\nnext visit Dexter; and be on your guard against yourself when your talk\r\nturns on Mrs. Beauly."\r\n\r\n"On my guard against myself? What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Practice, my dear Mrs. Eustace, has given me an eye for the little\r\nweaknesses of human nature. You are (quite naturally) disposed to\r\nbe jealous of Mrs. Beauly; and you are, in consequence, not in full\r\npossession of your excellent common-sense when Dexter uses that lady as\r\na means of blindfolding you. Am I speaking too freely?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. It is very degrading to me to be jealous of Mrs. Beauly.\r\nMy vanity suffers dreadfully when I think of it. But my common-sense\r\nyields to conviction. I dare say you are right."\r\n\r\n"I am delighted to find that we agree on one point," he rejoined, dryly.\r\n"I don\'t despair yet of convincing you in that far more serious matter\r\nwhich is still in dispute between us. And, what is more, if you will\r\nthrow no obstacles in the way, I look to Dexter himself to help me."\r\n\r\nThis aroused my curiosity. How Miserrimus Dexter could help him, in that\r\nor in any other way, was a riddle beyond my reading.\r\n\r\n"You propose to repeat to Dexter all that Lady Clarinda told you about\r\nMrs. Beauly," he went on. "And you think it is likely that Dexter will\r\nbe overwhelmed, as you were overwhelmed, when he hears the story. I am\r\ngoing to venture on a prophecy. I say that Dexter will disappoint you.\r\nFar from showing any astonishment, he will boldly tell you that you have\r\nbeen duped by a deliberately false statement of facts, invented and set\r\nafloat, in her own guilty interests, by Mrs. Beauly. Now tell me--if\r\nhe really try, in that way, to renew your unfounded suspicion of an\r\ninnocent woman, will _that_ shake your confidence in your own opinion?"\r\n\r\n"It will entirely destroy my confidence in my own opinion, Mr.\r\nPlaymore."\r\n\r\n"Very good. I shall expect you to write to me, in any case; and I\r\nbelieve we shall be of one mind before the week is out. Keep strictly\r\nsecret all that I said to you yesterday about Dexter. Don\'t even mention\r\nmy name when you see him. Thinking of him as I think now, I would as\r\nsoon touch the hand of the hangman as the hand of that monster! God\r\nbless you! Good-by."\r\n\r\nSo he said his farewell words, at the door of the hotel. Kind, genial,\r\nclever--but oh, how easily prejudiced, how shockingly obstinate in\r\nholding to his own opinion! And _what_ an opinion! I shuddered as I\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. MR. PLAYMORE\'S PROPHECY.\r\n\r\nWE reached London between eight and nine in the evening. Strictly\r\nmethodical in all his habits, Benjamin had telegraphed to his\r\nhousekeeper, from Edinburgh, to have supper ready or us by ten o\'clock,\r\nand to send the cabman whom he always employed to meet us at the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nArriving at the villa, we were obliged to wait for a moment to let a\r\npony-chaise get by us before we could draw up at Benjamin\'s door. The\r\nchaise passed very slowly, driven by a rough-looking man, with a pipe\r\nin his mouth. But for the man, I might have doubted whether the pony was\r\nquite a stranger to me. As things were, I thought no more of the matter.\r\n\r\nBenjamin\'s respectable old housekeeper opened the garden gate, and\r\nstartled me by bursting into a devout ejaculation of gratitude at the\r\nsight of her master. "The Lord be praised, sir!" she cried; "I thought\r\nyou would never come back!"\r\n\r\n"Anything wrong?" asked Benjamin, in his own impenetrably quiet way.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper trembled at the question, and answered in these\r\nenigmatical words:\r\n\r\n"My mind\'s upset, sir; and whether things are wrong or whether things\r\nare right is more than I can say. Hours ago, a strange man came in and\r\nasked"--she stopped, as if she were completely bewildered--looked for\r\na moment vacantly at her master--and suddenly addressed herself to me.\r\n"And asked," she proceeded, "when _you_ was expected back, ma\'am. I told\r\nhim what my master had telegraphed, and the man says upon that, \'Wait a\r\nbit,\' he says; \'I\'m coming back.\' He came back in a minute or less; and\r\nhe carried a Thing in his arms which curdled my blood--it did!--and set\r\nme shaking from the crown of my head to the sole of my foot. I know I\r\nought to have stopped it; but I couldn\'t stand upon my legs, much less\r\nput the man out of the house. In he went, without \'_with_ your leave,\'\r\nor \'_by_ your leave,\' Mr. Benjamin, sir--in he went, with the Thing in\r\nhis arms, straight through to your library. And there It has been all\r\nthese hours. And there It is now. I\'ve spoken to the police; but they\r\nwouldn\'t interfere; and what to do next is more than my poor head can\r\ntell. Don\'t you go in by yourself, ma\'am! You\'ll be frightened out of\r\nyour wits--you will!"\r\n\r\nI persisted in entering the house, for all that. Aided by the pony, I\r\neasily solved the mystery of the housekeeper\'s otherwise unintelligible\r\nnarrative. Passing through the dining-room (where the supper-table was\r\nalready laid for us), I looked through the half-opened library door.\r\n\r\nYes, there was Miserrimus Dexter, arrayed in his pink jacket, fast\r\nasleep in Benjamin\'s favorite arm-chair! No coverlet hid his horrible\r\ndeformity. Nothing was sacrificed to conventional ideas of propriety\r\nin his extraordinary dress. I could hardly wonder that the poor old\r\nhousekeeper trembled from head to foot when she spoke of him.\r\n\r\n"Valeria," said Benjamin, pointing to the Portent in the chair. "Which\r\nis it--an Indian idol, or a man?"\r\n\r\nI have already described Miserrimus Dexter as possessing the sensitive\r\near of a dog: he now allowed that he also slept the light sleep of a\r\ndog. Quietly as Benjamin had spoken, the strange voice aroused him on\r\nthe instant. He rubbed his eyes, and smiled as innocently as a waking\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Mrs. Valeria?" he said. "I have had a nice little sleep.\r\nYou don\'t know how happy I am to see you again. Who is this?"\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his eyes once more! and looked at Benjamin. Not knowing what\r\nelse to do in this extraordinary emergency, I presented my visitor to\r\nthe master of the house.\r\n\r\n"Excuse my getting up, sir," said Miserrimus Dexter. "I can\'t get up--I\r\nhave no legs. You look as if you thought I was occupying your chair? If\r\nI am committing an intrusion, be so good as to put your umbrella under\r\nme, and give me a jerk. I shall fall on my hands, and I shan\'t be\r\noffended with you. I will submit to a tumble and a scolding--but please\r\ndon\'t break my heart by sending me away. That beautiful woman there can\r\nbe very cruel sometimes, sir, when the fit takes her. She went away when\r\nI stood in the sorest need of a little talk with her--she went away, and\r\nleft me to my loneliness and my suspense. I am a poor deformed wretch,\r\nwith a warm heart, and, perhaps, an insatiable curiosity as well.\r\nInsatiable curiosity (have you ever felt it?) is a curse. I bore\r\nit until my brains began to boil in my head; and then I sent for my\r\ngardener, and made him drive me here. I like being here. The air of\r\nyour library soothes me; the sight of Mrs. Valeria is balm to my wounded\r\nheart. She has something to tell me--something that I am dying to hear.\r\nIf she is not too tired after her journey, and if you will let her tell\r\nit, I promise to have myself taken away when she has done. Dear Mr.\r\nBenjamin, you look like the refuge of the afflicted. I am afflicted.\r\nShake hands like a good Christian, and take me in."\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand. His soft blue eyes melted into an expression of\r\npiteous entreaty. Completely stupefied by the amazing harangue of which\r\nhe had been made the object, Benjamin took the offered hand, with\r\nthe air of a man in a dream. "I hope I see you well, sir," he said,\r\nmechanically--and then looked around at me, to know what he was to do\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n"I understand Mr. Dexter," I whispered. "Leave him to me."\r\n\r\nBenjamin stole a last bewildered look at the object in the chair; bowed\r\nto it, with the instinct of politeness which never failed him; and\r\n(still with the air of a man in a dream) withdrew into the next room.\r\n\r\nLeft together, we looked at each other, for the first moment, in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWhether I unconsciously drew on that inexhaustible store of indulgence\r\nwhich a woman always keeps in reserve for a man who owns that he has\r\nneed of her, or whether, resenting as I did Mr. Playmore\'s horrible\r\nsuspicion of him, my heart was especially accessible to feelings of\r\ncompassion in his unhappy case, I cannot tell. I only know that I pitied\r\nMiserrimus Dexter at that moment as I had never pitied him yet; and that\r\nI spared him the reproof which I should certainly have administered\r\nto any other man who had taken the liberty of establishing himself,\r\nuninvited, in Benjamin\'s house.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n"Lady Clarinda has destroyed your confidence in me!" he began, wildly.\r\n\r\n"Lady Clarinda has done nothing of the sort," I replied. "She has not\r\nattempted to influence my opinion. I was really obliged to leave London,\r\nas I told you."\r\n\r\nHe sighed, and closed his eyes contentedly, as if I had relieved him of\r\na heavy weight of anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Be merciful to me," he said, "and tell me something more. I have been\r\nso miserable in your absence." He suddenly opened his eyes again, and\r\nlooked at me with an appearance of the greatest interest. "Are you very\r\nmuch fatigued by traveling?" he proceeded. "I am hungry for news of what\r\nhappened at the Major\'s dinner party. Is it cruel of me to tell you so,\r\nwhen you have not rested after your journey? Only one question to-night,\r\nand I will leave the rest till to-morrow. What did Lady Clarinda say\r\nabout Mrs. Beauly? All that you wanted to hear?"\r\n\r\n"All, and more," I answered.\r\n\r\n"What? what? what?" he cried wild with impatience in a moment.\r\n\r\nMr. Playmore\'s last prophetic words were vividly present to my mind. He\r\nhad declared, in the most positive manner, that Dexter would persist in\r\nmisleading me, and would show no signs of astonishment when I repeated\r\nwhat Lady Clarinda had told me of Mrs. Beauly. I resolved to put\r\nthe lawyer\'s prophecy--so far as the question of astonishment was\r\nconcerned--to the sharpest attainable test. I said not a word to\r\nMiserrimus Dexter in the way of preface or preparation: I burst on him\r\nwith my news as abruptly as possible.\r\n\r\n"The person you saw in the corridor was not Mrs. Beauly," I said. "It\r\nwas the maid, dressed in her mistress\'s cloak and hat. Mrs. Beauly\r\nherself was not in the house at all. Mrs. Beauly herself was dancing at\r\na masked ball in Edinburgh. There is what the maid told Lady Clarinda;\r\nand there is what Lady Clarinda told _me._"\r\n\r\nIn the absorbing interest of the moment, I poured out those words one\r\nafter another as fast as they would pass my lips. Miserrimus Dexter\r\ncompletely falsified the lawyer\'s prediction. He shuddered under the\r\nshock. His eyes opened wide with amazement. "Say it again!" he cried. "I\r\ncan\'t take it all in at once. You stun me."\r\n\r\nI was more than contented with this result--I triumphed in my victory.\r\nFor once, I had really some reason to feel satisfied with myself. I\r\nhad taken the Christian and merciful side in my discussion with Mr.\r\nPlaymore; and I had won my reward. I could sit in the same room with\r\nMiserrimus Dexter, and feel the blessed conviction that I was not\r\nbreathing the same air with a poisoner. Was it not worth the visit to\r\nEdinburgh to have made sure of that?\r\n\r\nIn repeating, at his own desire, what I had already said to him, I took\r\ncare to add the details which made Lady Clarinda\'s narrative coherent\r\nand credible. He listened throughout with breathless attention--here and\r\nthere repeating the words after me, to impress them the more surely and\r\nthe more deeply on his mind.\r\n\r\n"What is to be said? what is to be done?" he asked, with a look of blank\r\ndespair. "I can\'t disbelieve it. From first to last, strange as it is,\r\nit sounds true."\r\n\r\n(How would Mr. Playmore have felt if he had heard those words? I did\r\nhim the justice to believe that he would have felt heartily ashamed of\r\nhimself.)\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to be said," I rejoined, "except that Mrs. Beauly is\r\ninnocent, and that you and I have done her a grievous wrong. Don\'t you\r\nagree with me?"\r\n\r\n"I entirely agree with you," he answered, without an instant\'s\r\nhesitation. "Mrs. Beauly is an innocent woman. The defense at the Trial\r\nwas the right defense after all."\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms complacently; he looked perfectly satisfied to leave\r\nthe matter there.\r\n\r\nI was not of his mind. To my own amazement, I now found myself the least\r\nreasonable person of the two!\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter (to use the popular phrase) had given me more than I\r\nhad bargained for. He had not only done all that I had anticipated\r\nin the way of falsifying Mr. Playmore\'s prediction--he had actually\r\nadvanced beyond my limits. I could go the length of recognizing Mrs.\r\nBeauly\'s innocence; but at that point I stopped. If the Defense at\r\nthe Trial were the right defense, farewell to all hope of asserting my\r\nhusband\'s innocence. I held to that hope as I held to my love and my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"Speak for yourself," I said. "My opinion of the Defense remains\r\nunchanged."\r\n\r\nHe started, and knit his brows as if I had disappointed and displeased\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Does that mean that you are determined to go on?"\r\n\r\n"It does."\r\n\r\nHe was downright angry with me. He cast his customary politeness to the\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\n"Absurd! impossible!" he cried, contemptuously. "You have yourself\r\ndeclared that we wronged an innocent woman when we suspected Mrs.\r\nBeauly. Is there any one else whom we can suspect? It is ridiculous to\r\nask the question. There is no alternative left but to accept the facts\r\nas they are, and to stir no further in the matter of the poisoning at\r\nGleninch. It is childish to dispute plain conclusions. You must give\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"You may be angry with me if you will, Mr. Dexter. Neither your anger\r\nnor your arguments will make me give up."\r\n\r\nHe controlled himself by an effort--he was quiet and polite again when\r\nhe next spoke to me.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Pardon me for a moment if I absorb myself in my own\r\nthoughts. I want to do something which I have not done yet."\r\n\r\n"What may that be, Mr. Dexter?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to put myself into Mrs. Beauly\'s skin, and to think with\r\nMrs. Beauly\'s mind. Give me a minute. Thank you."\r\n\r\nWhat did he mean? what new transformation of him was passing before my\r\neyes? Was there ever such a puzzle of a man as this? Who that saw him\r\nnow, intently pursuing his new train of thought, would have recognized\r\nhim as the childish creature who had awoke so innocently, and had\r\nastonished Benjamin by the infantine nonsense which he talked? It\r\nis said, and said truly, that there are many sides to every human\r\ncharacter. Dexter\'s many sides were developing themselves at such a\r\nrapid rate of progress that they were already beyond my counting.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his head, and fixed a look of keen inquiry on me.\r\n\r\n"I have come out of Mrs. Beauly\'s skin," he announced. "And I have\r\narrived at this result: We are two impetuous people; and we have been a\r\nlittle hasty in rushing at a conclusion."\r\n\r\nHe stopped. I said nothing. Was the shadow of a doubt of him beginning\r\nto rise in my mind? I waited, and listened.\r\n\r\n"I am as fully satisfied as ever of the truth of what Lady Clarinda told\r\nyou," he proceeded. "But I see, on consideration, what I failed to see at\r\nthe time. The story admits of two interpretations--one on the surface,\r\nand another under the surface. I look under the surface, in your\r\ninterests; and I say, it is just possible that Mrs. Beauly may have been\r\ncunning enough to forestall suspicion, and to set up an Alibi."\r\n\r\nI am ashamed to own that I did not understand what he meant by the last\r\nword--Alibi. He saw that I was not following him, and spoke out more\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\n"Was the maid something more than her mistress\'s passive accomplice?"\r\nhe said. "Was she the Hand that her mistress used? Was she on her way to\r\ngive the first dose of poison when she passed me in this corridor? Did\r\nMrs. Beauly spend the night in Edinburgh--so as to have her defense\r\nready, if suspicion fell upon her?"\r\n\r\nMy shadowy doubt of him became substantial doubt when I heard that. Had\r\nI absolved him a little too readily? Was he really trying to renew my\r\nsuspicions of Mrs. Beauly, as Mr. Playmore had foretold? This time I was\r\nobliged to answer him. In doing so, I unconsciously employed one of the\r\nphrases which the lawyer had used to me during my first interview with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"That sounds rather far-fetched, Mr. Dexter," I said.\r\n\r\nTo my relief, he made no attempt to defend the new view that he had\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\n"It is far-fetched," he admitted. "When I said it was just\r\npossible--though I didn\'t claim much for my idea--I said more for it\r\nperhaps than it deserved. Dismiss my view as ridiculous; what are you to\r\ndo next? If Mrs. Beauly is not the poisoner (either by herself or by her\r\nmaid), who is? She is innocent, and Eustace is innocent. Where is the\r\nother person whom you can suspect? Have _I_ poisoned her?" he cried,\r\nwith his eyes flashing, and his voice rising to its highest notes. "Do\r\nyou, does anybody, suspect Me? I loved her; I adored her; I have never\r\nbeen the same man since her death. Hush! I will trust you with a\r\nsecret. (Don\'t tell your husband; it might be the destruction of our\r\nfriendship.) I would have married her, before she met with Eustace,\r\nif she would have taken me. When the doctors told me she had died\r\npoisoned--ask Doctor Jerome what I suffered; _he_ can tell you! All\r\nthrough that horrible night I was awake; watching my opportunity until I\r\nfound my way to her. I got into the room, and took my last leave of the\r\ncold remains of the angel whom I loved. I cried over her. I kissed her.\r\nfor the first and last time. I stole one little lock of her hair. I have\r\nworn it ever since; I have kissed it night and day. Oh, God! the room\r\ncomes back to me! the dead face comes back to me! Look! look!"\r\n\r\nHe tore from its place of concealment in his bosom a little locket,\r\nfastened by a ribbon around his neck. He threw it to me where I sat, and\r\nburst into a passion of tears.\r\n\r\nA man in my place might have known what to do. Being only a woman, I\r\nyielded to the compassionate impulse of the moment.\r\n\r\nI got up and crossed the room to him. I gave him back his locket, and\r\nput my hand, without knowing what I was about, on the poor wretch\'s\r\nshoulder. "I am incapable of suspecting you, Mr. Dexter," I said,\r\ngently. "No such idea ever entered my head. I pity you from the bottom\r\nof my heart."\r\n\r\nHe caught my hand in his, and devoured it with kisses. His lips burned\r\nme like fire. He twisted himself suddenly in the chair, and wound his\r\narm around my waist. In the terror and indignation of the moment, vainly\r\nstruggling with him, I cried out for help.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Benjamin appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\nDexter let go his hold of me.\r\n\r\nI ran to Benjamin, and prevented him from advancing into the room. In\r\nall my long experience of my fatherly old friend I had never seen\r\nhim really angry yet. I saw him more than angry now. He was pale--the\r\npatient, gentle old man was pale with rage! I held him at the door with\r\nall my strength.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t lay your hand on a cripple," I said. Send for the man outside\r\nto take him a way.\r\n\r\nI drew Benjamin out of the room, and closed and locked the library\r\ndoor. The housekeeper was in the dining-room. I sent her out to call the\r\ndriver of the pony-chaise into the house.\r\n\r\nThe man came in--the rough man whom I had noticed when we were\r\napproaching the garden gate. Benjamin opened the library door in stern\r\nsilence. It was perhaps unworthy of me, but I could _not_ resist the\r\ntemptation to look in.\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter had sunk down in the chair. The rough man lifted his\r\nmaster with a gentleness that surprised me. "Hide my face," I heard\r\nDexter say to him, in broken tones. He opened his coarse pilot-jacket,\r\nand hid his master\'s head under it, and so went silently out--with the\r\ndeformed creature held to his bosom, like a woman sheltering her child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. ARIEL.\r\n\r\nI PASSED a sleepless night.\r\n\r\nThe outrage that had been offered to me was bad enough in itself.\r\nBut consequences were associated with it which might affect me more\r\nseriously still. In so far as the attainment of the one object of my\r\nlife might yet depend on my personal association with Miserrimus Dexter,\r\nan insurmountable obstacle appeared to be now placed in my way. Even in\r\nmy husband\'s interests, ought I to permit a man who had grossly insulted\r\nme to approach me again? Although I was no prude, I recoiled from the\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\nI arose late, and sat down at my desk, trying to summon energy enough to\r\nwrite to Mr. Playmore--and trying in vain.\r\n\r\nToward noon (while Benjamin happened to be out for a little while) the\r\nhousekeeper announced the arrival of another strange visitor at the gate\r\nof the villa.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a woman this time, ma\'am--or something like one," said this worthy\r\nperson, confidentially. "A great, stout, awkward, stupid creature, with\r\na man\'s hat on and a man\'s stick in her hand. She says she has got a\r\nnote for you, and she won\'t give it to anybody _but_ you. I\'d better not\r\nlet her in--had I?"\r\n\r\nRecognizing the original of the picture, I astonished the housekeeper by\r\nconsenting to receive the messenger immediately.\r\n\r\nAriel entered the room--in stolid silence, as usual. But I noticed a\r\nchange in her which puzzled me. Her dull eyes were red and bloodshot.\r\nTraces of tears (as I fancied) were visible on her fat, shapeless\r\ncheeks. She crossed the room, on her way to my chair, with a less\r\ndetermined tread than was customary with her. Could Ariel (I asked\r\nmyself) be woman enough to cry? Was it within the limits of possibility\r\nthat Ariel should approach me in sorrow and in fear?\r\n\r\n"I hear you have brought something for me?" I said. "Won\'t you sit\r\ndown?"\r\n\r\nShe handed me a letter--without answering and without taking a chair. I\r\nopened the envelope. The letter inside was written by Miserrimus Dexter.\r\nIt contained these lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n"Try to pity me, if you have any pity left for a miserable man; I have\r\nbitterly expiated the madness of a moment. If you could see me--even\r\nyou would own that my punishment has been heavy enough. For God\'s sake,\r\ndon\'t abandon me! I was beside myself when I let the feeling that you\r\nhave awakened in me get the better of my control. It shall never show\r\nitself again; it shall be a secret that dies with me. Can I expect you\r\nto believe this? No. I won\'t ask you to believe me; I won\'t ask you to\r\ntrust me in the future. If you ever consent to see me again, let it be\r\nin the presence of any third person whom you may appoint to protect you.\r\nI deserve that--I will submit to it; I will wait till time has composed\r\nyour angry feeling against me. All I ask now is leave to hope. Say to\r\nAriel, \'I forgive him; and one day I will let him see me again.\'\r\nShe will remember it, for love of me. If you send her back without a\r\nmessage, you send me to the mad-house. Ask her, if you don\'t believe me.\r\n\r\n                              "MISERRIMUS DEXTER."\r\n\r\nI finished the strange letter, and looked at Ariel.\r\n\r\nShe stood with her eyes on the floor, and held out to me the thick\r\nwalking-stick which she carried in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Take the stick" were the first words she said to me.\r\n\r\n"Why am I to take it?" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe struggled a little with her sluggishly working mind, and slowly put\r\nher thoughts into words.\r\n\r\n"You\'re angry with the Master," she said. "Take it out on Me. Here\'s the\r\nstick. Beat me."\r\n\r\n"Beat you!" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"My back\'s broad," said the poor creature. "I won\'t make a row. I\'ll\r\nbear it. Drat you, take the stick! Don\'t vex _him._ Whack it out on my\r\nback. Beat _me._"\r\n\r\nShe roughly forced the stick into my hand; she turned her poor shapeless\r\nshoulders to me; waiting for the blow. It was at once dreadful and\r\ntouching to see her. The tears rose in my eyes. I tried, gently and\r\npatiently, to reason with her. Quite useless! The idea of taking the\r\nMaster\'s punishment on herself was the one idea in her mind. "Don\'t vex\r\n_him,_" she repeated. "Beat _me._"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by \'vexing him\'?" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe tried to explain, and failed to find the words. She showed me by\r\nimitation, as a savage might have shown me, what she meant. Striding to\r\nthe fire-place, she crouched on the rug, and looked into the fire with a\r\nhorrible vacant stare. Then she clasped her hands over her forehead, and\r\nrocked slowly to and fro, still staring into the fire. "There\'s how he\r\nsits!" she said, with a sudden burst of speech. "Hours on hours, there\'s\r\nhow he sits! Notices nobody. Cries about _you._"\r\n\r\nThe picture she presented recalled to my memory the Report of Dexter\'s\r\nhealth, and the doctor\'s plain warning of peril waiting for him in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nEven if I could have resisted Ariel, I must have yielded to the vague\r\ndread of consequences which now shook me in secret.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that!" I cried. She was still rocking herself in imitation\r\nof the "Master," and still staring into the fire with her hands to her\r\nhead. "Get up, pray! I am not angry with him now. I forgive him."\r\n\r\nShe rose on her hands and knees, and waited, looking up intently into my\r\nface. In that attitude--more like a dog than a human being--she repeated\r\nher customary petition when she wanted to fix words that interested her\r\nin her mind.\r\n\r\n"Say it again!"\r\n\r\nI did as she bade me. She was not satisfied.\r\n\r\n"Say it as it is in the letter," she went on. "Say it as the Master said\r\nit to Me."\r\n\r\nI looked back at the letter, and repeated the form of message contained\r\nin the latter part of it, word for word:\r\n\r\n"I forgive him; and one day I will let him see me again."\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet at a bound. For the first time since she had\r\nentered the room her dull face began to break slowly into light and\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" she cried. "Hear if I can say it, too; hear if I\'ve got it\r\nby heart."\r\n\r\nTeaching her exactly as I should have taught a child, I slowly fastened\r\nthe message, word by word, on her mind.\r\n\r\n"Now rest yourself," I said; "and let me give you something to eat and\r\ndrink after your long walk."\r\n\r\nI might as well have spoken to one of the chairs. She snatched up her\r\nstick from the floor, and burst out with a hoarse shout of joy. "I\'ve\r\ngot it by heart!" she cried. "This will cool the Master\'s head! Hooray!"\r\nShe dashed out into the passage like a wild animal escaping from its\r\ncage. I was just in time to see her tear open the garden gate, and set\r\nforth on her walk back at a pace which made it hopeless to attempt to\r\nfollow and stop her.\r\n\r\nI returned to the sitting-room, pondering on a question which has\r\nperplexed wiser heads than mine. Could a man who was hopelessly and\r\nentirely wicked have inspired such devoted attachment to him as Dexter\r\nhad inspired in the faithful woman who had just left me? in the rough\r\ngardener who had carried him out so gently on the previous night? Who\r\ncan decide? The greatest scoundrel living always has a friend--in a\r\nwoman or a dog.\r\n\r\nI sat down again at my desk, and made another attempt to write to Mr.\r\nPlaymore.\r\n\r\nRecalling, for the purpose of my letter, all that Miserrimus Dexter\r\nhad said to me, my memory dwelt with special interest on the strange\r\noutbreak of feeling which had led him to betray the secret of his\r\ninfatuation for Eustace\'s first wife. I saw again the ghastly scene in\r\nthe death-chamber--the deformed creature crying over the corpse in the\r\nstillness of the first dark hours of the new day. The horrible picture\r\ntook a strange hold on my mind. I arose, and walked up and down, and\r\ntried to turn my thoughts some other way. It was not to be done: the\r\nscene was too familiar to me to be easily dismissed. I had myself\r\nvisited the room and looked at the bed. I had myself walked in the\r\ncorridor which Dexter had crossed on his way to take his last leave of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe corridor? I stopped. My thoughts suddenly took a new direction,\r\nuninfluenced by any effort of my will.\r\n\r\nWhat other association besides the association with Dexter did I connect\r\nwith the corridor? Was it something I had seen during my visit to\r\nGleninch? No. Was it something I had read? I snatched up the Report\r\nof the Trial to see. It opened at a page which contained the nurse\'s\r\nevidence. I read the evidence through again, without recovering the lost\r\nremembrance until I came to these lines close at the end:\r\n\r\n"Before bed-time I went upstairs to prepare the remains of the deceased\r\nlady for the coffin. The room in which she lay was locked; the door\r\nleading into Mr. Macallan\'s room being secured, as well as the door\r\nleading into the corridor. The keys had been taken away by Mr. Gale. Two\r\nof the men-servants were posted outside the bedroom to keep watch. They\r\nwere to be relieved at four in the morning--that was all they could tell\r\nme."\r\n\r\nThere was my lost association with the corridor! There was what I ought\r\nto have remembered when Miserrimus Dexter was telling me of his visit to\r\nthe dead!\r\n\r\nHow had he got into the bedroom--the doors being locked, and the keys\r\nbeing taken away by Mr. Gale? There was but one of the locked doors of\r\nwhich Mr. Gale had not got the key--the door of communication between\r\nthe study and the bedroom. The key was missing from this. Had it been\r\nstolen? And was Dexter the thief? He might have passed by the men on the\r\nwatch while they were asleep, or he might have crossed the corridor in\r\nan unguarded interval while the men were being relieved. But how could\r\nhe have got into the bedchamber except by way of the locked study door?\r\nHe _must_ have had the key! And he _must_ have secreted it weeks before\r\nMrs. Eustace Macallan\'s death! When the nurse first arrived at Gleninch,\r\non the seventh of the month, her evidence declared the key of the door\r\nof communication to be then missing.\r\n\r\nTo what conclusion did these considerations and discoveries point? Had\r\nMiserrimus Dexter, in a moment of ungovernable agitation, unconsciously\r\nplaced the clew in my hands? Was the pivot on which turned the whole\r\nmystery of the poisoning at Gleninch the missing key?\r\n\r\nI went back for the third time to my desk. The one person who might be\r\ntrusted to find the answer to those questions was Mr. Playmore. I wrote\r\nhim a full and careful account of all that had happened; I begged him to\r\nforgive and forget my ungracious reception of the advice which he had\r\nso kindly offered to me; and I promised beforehand to do nothing without\r\nfirst consulting his opinion in the new emergency which now confronted\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe day was fine for the time of year; and by way of getting a little\r\nwholesome exercise after the surprises and occupations of the morning, I\r\ntook my letter to Mr. Playmore to the post.\r\n\r\nReturning to the villa, I was informed that another visitor was waiting\r\nto see me: a civilized visitor this time, who had given her name. My\r\nmother-in-law--Mrs. Macallan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII. AT THE BEDSIDE.\r\n\r\nBEFORE she had uttered a word, I saw in my mother-in-law\'s face that she\r\nbrought bad news.\r\n\r\n"Eustace?" I said.\r\n\r\nShe answered me by a look.\r\n\r\n"Let me he ar it at once!" I cried. "I can bear anything but suspense."\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan lifted her hand, and showed me a telegraphic dispatch\r\nwhich she had hitherto kept concealed in the folds of her dress.\r\n\r\n"I can trust your courage," she said. "There is no need, my child, to\r\nprevaricate with you. Read that."\r\n\r\nI read the telegram. It was sent by the chief surgeon of a\r\nfield-hospital; and it was dated from a village in the north of Spain.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Eustace severely wounded in a skirmish by a stray shot. Not in\r\ndanger, so far. Every care taken of him. Wait for another telegram."\r\n\r\nI turned away my face, and bore as best I might the pang that wrung me\r\nwhen I read those words. I thought I knew how dearly I loved him: I had\r\nnever known it till that moment.\r\n\r\nMy mother-in-law put her arm round me, and held me to her tenderly. She\r\nknew me well enough not to speak to me at that moment.\r\n\r\nI rallied my courage, and pointed to the last sentence in the telegram.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to wait?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Not a day!" she answered. "I am going to the Foreign Office about my\r\npassport--I have some interest there: they can give me letters; they can\r\nadvise and assist me. I leave to-night by the mail train to Calais."\r\n\r\n"_You_ leave?" I said. "Do you suppose I will let you go without me? Get\r\nmy passport when you get yours. At seven this evening I will be at your\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nShe attempted to remonstrate; she spoke of the perils of the journey.\r\nAt the first words I stopped her. "Don\'t you know yet, mother, how\r\nobstinate I am? They may keep you waiting at the Foreign Office. Why do\r\nyou waste the precious hours here?"\r\n\r\nShe yielded with a gentleness that was not in her everyday character.\r\n"Will my poor Eustace ever know what a wife he has got?" That was all\r\nshe said. She kissed me, and went away in her carriage.\r\n\r\nMy remembrances of our journey are strangely vague and imperfect.\r\n\r\nAs I try to recall them, the memory of those more recent and more\r\ninteresting events which occurred after my return to England gets\r\nbetween me and my adventures in Spain, and seems to force these last\r\ninto a shadowy background, until they look like adventures that happened\r\nmany years since. I confusedly recollect delays and alarms that tried\r\nour patience and our courage. I remember our finding friends (thanks to\r\nour letters of recommendation) in a Secretary to the Embassy and in a\r\nQueen\'s Messenger, who assisted and protected us at a critical point in\r\nthe journey. I recall to mind a long succession of men in our employment\r\nas travelers, all equally remarkable for their dirty cloaks and their\r\nclean linen, for their highly civilized courtesy to women and their\r\nutterly barbarous cruelty to horses. Last, and most important of all, I\r\nsee again, more clearly than I can see anything else, the one wretched\r\nbedroom of a squalid village inn in which we found our poor darling,\r\nprostrate between life and death, insensible to everything that passed\r\nin the narrow little world that lay around his bedside.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing romantic or interesting in the accident which had put\r\nmy husband\'s life in peril.\r\n\r\nHe had ventured too near the scene of the conflict (a miserable affair)\r\nto rescue a poor lad who lay wounded on the field--mortally wounded,\r\nas the event proved. A rifle-bullet had struck him in the body. His\r\nbrethren of the field-hospital had carried him back to their quarters\r\nat the risk of their lives. He was a great favorite with all of them;\r\npatient and gentle and brave; only wanting a little more judgment to be\r\nthe most valuable recruit who had joined the brotherhood.\r\n\r\nIn telling me this, the surgeon kindly and delicately added a word of\r\nwarning as well.\r\n\r\nThe fever caused by the wound had brought with it delirium, as usual.\r\nMy poor husband\'s mind, in so far as his wandering words might interpret\r\nit, was filled by the one image of his wife. The medical attendant\r\nhad heard enough in the course of his ministrations at the bedside,\r\nto satisfy him that any sudden recognition of me by Eustace (if he\r\nrecovered) might be attended by the most lamentable results. As things\r\nwere at that sad time, I might take my turn at nursing him, without the\r\nslightest chance of his discovering me, perhaps for weeks and weeks to\r\ncome. But on the day when he was declared out of danger--if that happy\r\nday ever arrived--I must resign my place at his bedside, and must wait\r\nto show myself until the surgeon gave me leave.\r\n\r\nMy mother-in-law and I relieved each other regularly, day and night, in\r\nthe sick-room.\r\n\r\nIn the hours of his delirium--hours that recurred with a pitiless\r\nregularity--my name was always on my poor darling\'s fevered lips.\r\nThe ruling idea in him was the fine dreadful idea which I had vainly\r\ncombated at our last interview. In the face of the verdict pronounced\r\nat the Trial, it was impossible even for his wife to be really and truly\r\npersuaded that he was an innocent man. All the wild pictures which his\r\ndistempered imagination drew were equally inspired by that one obstinate\r\nconviction. He fancied himself to be still living with me under those\r\ndreaded conditions. Do what he might, I was always recalling to him the\r\nterrible ordeal through which he had passed. He acted his part, and he\r\nacted mine. He gave me a cup of tea; and I said to him, "We quarreled\r\nyesterday, Eustace. Is it poisoned?" He kissed me, in token of our\r\nreconciliation; and I laughed, and said, "It\'s morning now, my dear.\r\nShall I die by nine o\'clock to-night?" I was ill in bed, and he gave me\r\nmy medicine. I looked at him with a doubting eye. I said to him, "You\r\nare in love with another woman. Is there anything in the medicine that\r\nthe doctor doesn\'t know of?" Such was the horrible drama which now\r\nperpetually acted itself in his mind. Hundreds and hundreds of times I\r\nheard him repeat it, almost always in the same words. On other occasions\r\nhis thoughts wandered away to my desperate project of proving him to be\r\nan innocent man. Sometimes he laughed at it. Sometimes he mourned\r\nover it. Sometimes he devised cunning schemes for placing unsuspected\r\nobstacles in my way. He was especially hard on me when he was inventing\r\nhis preventive stratagems--he cheerfully instructed the visionary people\r\nwho assisted him not to hesitate at offending or distressing me. "Never\r\nmind if you make her angry; never mind if you make her cry. It\'s all for\r\nher good; it\'s all to save the poor fool from dangers she doesn\'t dream\r\nof. You mustn\'t pity her when she says she does it for my sake. See! she\r\nis going to be insulted; she is going to be deceived; she is going to\r\ndisgrace herself without knowing it. Stop her! stop her!" It was weak of\r\nme, I know; I ought to have kept the plain fact that he was out of his\r\nsenses always present to my mind: still it is true that my hours passed\r\nat my husband\'s pillow were many of them hours of mortification and\r\nmisery of which he, poor dear, was the innocent and only cause.\r\n\r\nThe weeks passed; and he still hovered between life and death.\r\n\r\nI kept no record of the time, and I cannot now recall the exact date on\r\nwhich the first favorable change took place. I only remember that it was\r\ntoward sunrise on a fine winter morning when we were relieved at last of\r\nour heavy burden of suspense. The surgeon happened to be by the bedside\r\nwhen his patient awoke. The first thing he did, after looking at\r\nEustace, was to caution me by a sign to be silent and to keep out of\r\nsight. My mother-in-law and I both knew what this meant. With full\r\nhearts we thanked God together for giving us back the husband and the\r\nson.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, being alone, we ventured to speak of the future--for\r\nthe first time since we had left home.\r\n\r\n"The surgeon tells me," said Mrs. Macallan, "that Eustace is too weak to\r\nbe capable of bearing anything in the nature of a surprise for some days\r\nto come. We have time to consider whether he is or is not to be told\r\nthat he owes his life as much to your care as to mine. Can you find it\r\nin your heart to leave him, Valeria, now that God\'s mercy has restored\r\nhim to you and to me?"\r\n\r\n"If I only consulted my own heart," I answered, "I should never leave\r\nhim again."\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan looked at me in grave surprise.\r\n\r\n"What else have you to consult?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"If we both live," I replied, "I have to think of the happiness of his\r\nlife and the happiness of mine in the years that are to come. I can bear\r\na great deal, mother, but I cannot endure the misery of his leaving me\r\nfor the second time."\r\n\r\n"You wrong him, Valeria--I firmly believe you wrong him--in thinking it\r\npossible that he can leave you again."\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs. Macallan, have you forgotten already what we have both heard\r\nhim say of me while we have been sitting by his bedside?"\r\n\r\n"We have heard the ravings of a man in delirium. It is surely hard\r\nto hold Eustace responsible for what he said when he was out of his\r\nsenses."\r\n\r\n"It is harder still," I said, "to resist his mother when she is pleading\r\nfor him. Dearest and best of friends! I don\'t hold Eustace responsible\r\nfor what he said in the fever--but I _do_ take warning by it. The\r\nwildest words that fell from him were, one and all, the faithful echo of\r\nwhat he said to me in the best days of his health and his strength. What\r\nhope have I that he will recover with an altered mind toward me? Absence\r\nhas not changed it; suffering has not changed it. In the delirium\r\nof fever, and in the full possession of his reason, he has the same\r\ndreadful doubt of me. I see but one way of winning him back: I must\r\ndestroy at its root his motive for leaving me. It is hopeless to\r\npersuade him that I believe in his innocence: I must show him that\r\nbelief is no longer necessary; I must prove to him that his position\r\ntoward me has become the position of an innocent man!"\r\n\r\n"Valeria! Valeria! you are wasting time and words. You have tried the\r\nexperiment; and you know as well as I do that the thing is not to be\r\ndone."\r\n\r\nI had no answer to that. I could say no more than I had said already.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you go back to Dexter, out of sheer compassion for a mad\r\nand miserable wretch who has already insulted you," proceeded my\r\nmother-in-law. "You can only go back accompanied by me, or by some\r\nother trustworthy person. You can only stay long enough to humor the\r\ncreature\'s wayward fancy, and to keep his crazy brain quiet for a time.\r\nThat done, all is done--you leave him. Even supposing Dexter to be still\r\ncapable of helping you, how can you make use of him but by admitting him\r\nto terms of confidence and familiarity--by treating him, in short, on\r\nthe footing of an intimate friend? Answer me honestly: can you bring\r\nyourself to do that, after what happened at Mr. Benjamin\'s house?"\r\n\r\nI had told her of my last interview with Miserrimus Dexter, in\r\nthe natural confidence that she inspired in me as relative and\r\nfellow-traveler; and this was the use to which she turned her\r\ninformation! I suppose I had no right to blame her; I suppose the motive\r\nsanctioned everything. At any rate, I had no choice but to give offense\r\nor to give an answer. I gave it. I acknowledged that I could never\r\nagain permit Miserrimus Dexter to treat me on terms of familiarity as a\r\ntrusted and intimate friend.\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan pitilessly pressed the advantage that she had won.\r\n\r\n"Very well," she said, "that resource being no longer open to you, what\r\nhope is left? Which way are you to turn next?"\r\n\r\nThere was no meeting those questions, in my present situation, by any\r\nadequate reply. I felt strangely unlike myself--I submitted in silence.\r\nMrs. Macallan struck the last blow that completed her victory.\r\n\r\n"My poor Eustace is weak and wayward," she said; "but he is not an\r\nungrateful man. My child, you have returned him good for evil--you have\r\nproved how faithfully and how devotedly you love him, by suffering all\r\nhardships and risking all dangers for his sake. Trust me, and trust\r\nhim! He cannot resist you. Let him see the dear face that he has been\r\ndreaming of looking at him again with all the old love in it, and he is\r\nyours once more, my daughter--yours for life." She rose and touched my\r\nforehead with her lips; her voice sank to tones of tenderness which I\r\nhad never heard from her yet. "Say yes, Valeria," she whispered; "and be\r\ndearer to me and dearer to him than ever!"\r\n\r\nMy heart sided with her. My energies were worn out. No letter had\r\narrived from Mr. Playmore to guide and to encourage me. I had resisted\r\nso long and so vainly; I had tried and suffered so much; I had met with\r\nsuch cruel disasters and such reiterated disappointments--and he was in\r\nthe room beneath me, feebly finding his way back to consciousness and\r\nto life--how could I resist? It was all over. In saying Yes (if Eustace\r\nconfirmed his mother\'s confidence in him), I was saying adieu to the\r\none cherished ambition, the one dear and noble hope of my life. I knew\r\nit--and I said Yes.\r\n\r\nAnd so good-by to the grand struggle! And so welcome to the new\r\nresignation which owned that I had failed.\r\n\r\nMy mother-in-law and I slept together under the only shelter that the\r\ninn could offer to us--a sort of loft at the top of the house. The night\r\nthat followed our conversation was bitterly cold. We felt the chilly\r\ntemperature, in spite of the protection of our dressing-gowns and our\r\ntraveling-wrappers. My mother-in-law slept, but no rest came to me. I\r\nwas too anxious and too wretched, thinking over my changed position, and\r\ndoubting how my husband would receive me, to be able to sleep.\r\n\r\nSome hours, as I suppose, must have passed, and I was still absorbed in\r\nmy own melancholy thoughts, when I suddenly became conscious of a new\r\nand strange sensation which astonished and alarmed me. I started up in\r\nthe bed, breathless and bewildered. The movement awakened Mrs. Macallan.\r\n"Are you ill?" she asked. "What is the matter with you?" I tried to tell\r\nher, as well as I could. She seemed to understand me before I had done;\r\nshe took me tenderly in her arms, and pressed me to her bosom. "My poor\r\ninnocent child," she said, "is it possible you don\'t know? Must I really\r\ntell you?" She whispered her next words. Shall I ever forget the tumult\r\nof feelings which the whisper aroused in me--the strange medley of joy\r\nand fear, and wonder and relief, and pride and humility, which filled my\r\nwhole being, and made a new woman of me from that moment? Now, for the\r\nfirst time, I knew it! If God spared me for a few months more, the most\r\nenduring and the most sacred of all human joys might be mine--the joy of\r\nbeing a mother.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know how the rest of the night passed. I only find my memory\r\nagain when the morning came, and when I went out by myself to breathe\r\nthe crisp wintry air on the open moor behind the inn.\r\n\r\nI have said that I felt like a new woman. The morning found me with a\r\nnew resolution and a new courage. When I thought of the future, I had\r\nnot only my husband to consider now. His good name was no longer his\r\nown and mine--it might soon become the most precious inheritance that\r\nhe could leave to his child. What had I done while I was in ignorance of\r\nthis? I had resigned the hope of cleansing his name from the stain that\r\nrested on it--a stain still, no matter how little it might look in the\r\neye of the Law. Our child might live to hear malicious tongues say,\r\n"Your father was tried for the vilest of all murders, and was never\r\nabsolutely acquitted of the charge." Could I face the glorious perils of\r\nchildbirth with that possibility present to my mind? No! not until I had\r\nmade one more effort to lay the conscience of Miserrimus Dexter bare to\r\nmy view! not until I had once again renewed the struggle, and brought\r\nthe truth that vindicated the husband and the father to the light of\r\nday!\r\n\r\nI went back to the house, with my new courage to sustain me. I opened my\r\nheart to my friend and mother, and told her frankly of the change that\r\nhad come over me since we had last spoken of Eustace.\r\n\r\nShe was more than disappointed--she was almost offended with me. The one\r\nthing needful had happened, she said. The happiness that might soon\r\ncome to us would form a new tie between my husband and me. Every other\r\nconsideration but this she treated as purely fanciful. If I left Eustace\r\nnow, I did a heartless thing and a foolish thing. I should regret, to\r\nthe end of my days, having thrown away the one golden opportunity of my\r\nmarried life.\r\n\r\nIt cost me a hard struggle, it oppressed me with many a painful doubt;\r\nbut I held firm this time. The honor of the father, the inheritance of\r\nthe child--I kept these thoughts as constant ly as possible before my\r\nmind. Sometimes they failed me, and left me nothing better than a poor\r\nfool who had some fitful bursts of crying, and was always ashamed of\r\nherself afterward. But my native obstinacy (as Mrs. Macallan said)\r\ncarried me through. Now and then I had a peep at Eustace, while he was\r\nasleep; and that helped me too. Though they made my heart ache and shook\r\nme sadly at the times those furtive visits to my husband fortified\r\nme afterward. I cannot explain how this happened (it seems so\r\ncontradictory); I can only repeat it as one of my experiences at that\r\ntroubled time.\r\n\r\nI made one concession to Mrs. Macallan--I consented to wait for two days\r\nbefore I took any steps for returning to England, on the chance that my\r\nmind might change in the interval.\r\n\r\nIt was well for me that I yielded so far. On the second day the director\r\nof the field-hospital sent to the post-office at our nearest town for\r\nletters addressed to him or to his care. The messenger brought back a\r\nletter for me. I thought I recognized the handwriting, and I was right.\r\nMr. Playmore\'s answer had reached me at last!\r\n\r\nIf I had been in any danger of changing my mind, the good lawyer would\r\nhave saved me in the nick of time. The extract that follows contains the\r\npith of his letter; and shows how he encouraged me when I stood in sore\r\nneed of a few cheering and friendly words.\r\n\r\n"Let me now tell you," he wrote, "what I have done toward verifying the\r\nconclusion to which your letter points.\r\n\r\n"I have traced one of the servants who was appointed to keep watch in\r\nthe corridor on the night when the first Mrs. Eustace died at Gleninch.\r\nThe man perfectly remembers that Miserrimus Dexter suddenly appeared\r\nbefore him and his fellow-servant long after the house was quiet for the\r\nnight. Dexter said to them, \'I suppose there is no harm in my going into\r\nthe study to read? I can\'t sleep after what has happened; I must relieve\r\nmy mind somehow.\' The men had no orders to keep any one out of the\r\nstudy. They knew that the door of communication with the bedchamber was\r\nlocked, and that the keys of the two other doors of communication were\r\nin the possession of Mr. Gale. They accordingly permitted Dexter to\r\ngo into the study. He closed the door (the door that opened on the\r\ncorridor), and remained absent for some time--in the study as the men\r\nsupposed; in the bedchamber as we know from what he let out at his\r\ninterview with you. Now he could enter that room, as you rightly\r\nimagine, in but one way--by being in possession of the missing key.\r\nHow long he remained there I cannot discover. The point is of little\r\nconsequence. The servant remembers that he came out of the study again\r\n\'as pale as death,\' and that he passed on without a word on his way back\r\nto his own room.\r\n\r\n"These are facts. The conclusion to which they lead is serious in the\r\nlast degree. It justifies everything that I confided to you in my office\r\nat Edinburgh. You remember what passed between us. I say no more.\r\n\r\n"As to yourself next. You have innocently aroused in Miserrimus Dexter a\r\nfeeling toward you which I need not attempt to characterize. There is a\r\ncertain something--I saw it myself--in your figure, and in some of your\r\nmovements, which does recall the late Mrs. Eustace to those who knew her\r\nwell, and which has evidently had its effect on Dexter\'s morbid mind.\r\nWithout dwelling further on this subject, let me only remind you that\r\nhe has shown himself (as a consequence of your influence over him) to\r\nbe incapable, in his moments of agitation, of thinking before he speaks\r\nwhile he is in your presence. It is not merely possible, it is highly\r\nprobable, that he may betray himself far more seriously than he has\r\nbetrayed himself yet if you give him the opportunity. I owe it to you\r\n(knowing what your interests are) to express myself plainly on this\r\npoint. I have no sort of doubt that you have advanced one step nearer\r\nto the end which you have in view in the brief interval since you left\r\nEdinburgh. I see in your letter (and in my discoveries) irresistible\r\nevidence that Dexter must have been in secret communication with the\r\ndeceased lady (innocent communication, I am certain, so far as _she_\r\nwas concerned), not only at the time of her death, but perhaps for weeks\r\nbefore it. I cannot disguise from myself or from you, my own strong\r\npersuasion that if you succeed in discovering the nature of this\r\ncommunication, in all human likelihood you prove your husband\'s\r\ninnocence by the discovery of the truth. As an honest man, I am bound\r\nnot to conceal this. And, as an honest man also, I am equally bound\r\nto add that, not even with your reward in view, can I find it in\r\nmy conscience to advise you to risk what you must risk if you see\r\nMiserrimus Dexter again. In this difficult and delicate matter I cannot\r\nand will not take the responsibility: the final decision must rest with\r\nyourself. One favor only I entreat you to grant--let me hear what you\r\nresolve to do as soon as you know it yourself."\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which my worthy correspondent felt were no difficulties\r\nto me. I did not possess Mr. Playmore\'s judicial mind. My resolution was\r\nsettled before I had read his letter through.\r\n\r\nThe mail to France crossed the frontier the next day. There was a place\r\nfor me, under the protection of the conductor, if I chose to take\r\nit. Without consulting a living creature--rash as usual, headlong as\r\nusual--I took it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. ON THE JOURNEY BACK.\r\n\r\nIF I had been traveling homeward in my own carriage, the remaining\r\nchapters of this narrative would never have been written. Before we had\r\nbeen an hour on the road I should have called to the driver, and should\r\nhave told him to turn back.\r\n\r\nWho can be always resolute?\r\n\r\nIn asking that question, I speak of the women, not of the men. I\r\nhad been resolute in turning a deaf ear to Mr. Playmore\'s doubts and\r\ncautions; resolute in holding out against my mother-in-law; resolute\r\nin taking my place by the French mail. Until ten minutes after we had\r\ndriven away from the inn my courage held out--and then it failed me;\r\nthen I said to myself, "You wretch, you have deserted your husband!" For\r\nhours afterward, if I could have stopped the mail, I would have done it.\r\nI hated the conductor, the kindest of men. I hated the Spanish ponies\r\nthat drew us, the cheeriest animals that ever jingled a string of\r\nbells. I hated the bright day that _would_ make things pleasant, and\r\nthe bracing air that forced me to feel the luxury of breathing whether\r\nI liked it or not. Never was a journey more miserable than my safe and\r\neasy journey to the frontier. But one little comfort helped me to bear\r\nmy heart-ache resignedly--a stolen morsel of Eustace\'s hair. We had\r\nstarted at an hour of the morning when he was still sound asleep. I\r\ncould creep into his room, and kiss him, and cry over him softly, and\r\ncut off a stray lock of his hair, without danger of discovery. How I\r\nsummoned resolution enough to leave him is, to this hour, not clear to\r\nmy mind. I think my mother-in-law must have helped me, without meaning\r\nto do it. She came into the room with an erect head and a cold eye; she\r\nsaid, with an unmerciful emphasis on the word, "If you _mean_ to go,\r\nValeria, the carriage is here." Any woman with a spark of spirit in her\r\nwould have "meant" it under those circumstances. I meant it--and did it.\r\n\r\nAnd then I was sorry for it. Poor humanity! Time has got all the credit\r\nof being the great consoler of afflicted mortals. In my opinion, Time\r\nhas been overrated in this matter. Distance does the same beneficent\r\nwork far more speedily, and (when assisted by Change) far more\r\neffectually as well. On the railroad to Paris, I became capable of\r\ntaking a sensible view of my position. I could now remind myself that\r\nmy husband\'s reception of me--after the first surprise and the first\r\nhappiness had passed away--might not have justified his mother\'s\r\nconfidence in him. Admitting that I ran a risk in going back to\r\nMiserrimus Dexter, should I not have been equally rash, in another way,\r\nif I had returned, uninvited, to a husband who had declared that our\r\nconjugal happiness was impossible, and that our married life was at an\r\nend? Besides, who could say that the events of the future might not y\r\net justify me--not only to myself, but to him? I might yet hear him\r\nsay, "She was inquisitive when she had no business to inquire; she\r\nwas obstinate when she ought; to have listened to reason; she left my\r\nbedside when other women would have remained; but in the end she atoned\r\nfor it all--she turned out to be right!"\r\n\r\nI rested a day at Paris and wrote three letters.\r\n\r\nOne to Benjamin, telling him to expect me the next evening. One to Mr.\r\nPlaymore, warning him, in good time, that I meant to make a last effort\r\nto penetrate the mystery at Gleninch. One to Eustace (of a few lines\r\nonly), owning that I had helped to nurse him through the dangerous part\r\nof his illness; confessing the one reason which had prevailed with me\r\nto leave him; and entreating him to suspend his opinion of me until time\r\nhad proved that I loved him more dearly than ever. This last letter I\r\ninclosed to my mother-in-law, leaving it to her discretion to choose the\r\nright time for giving it to her son. I positively forbade Mrs. Macallan,\r\nhowever, to tell Eustace of the new tie between us. Although he _had_\r\nseparated himself from me, I was determined that he should not hear\r\nit from other lips than mine. Never mind why. There are certain little\r\nmatters which I must keep to myself; and this is one of them.\r\n\r\nMy letters being written, my duty was done. I was free to play my last\r\ncard in the game--the darkly doubtful game which was neither quite for\r\nme nor quite against me as the chances now stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX. ON THE WAY TO DEXTER.\r\n\r\n"I DECLARE to Heaven, Valeria, I believe that monster\'s madness is\r\ninfectious--and you have caught it!"\r\n\r\nThis was Benjamin\'s opinion of me (on my safe arrival at the villa)\r\nafter I had announced my intention of returning Miserrimus Dexter\'s\r\nvisit, in his company.\r\n\r\nBeing determined to carry my point, I could afford to try the influence\r\nof mild persuasion. I begged my good friend to have a little patience\r\nwith me. "And do remember what I have already told you," I added. "It is\r\nof serious importance to me to see Dexter again."\r\n\r\nI only heaped fuel on the fire. "See him again?" Benjamin repeated\r\nindignantly. "See him, after he grossly insulted you, under my roof, in\r\nthis very room? I can\'t be awake; I must be asleep and dreaming!"\r\n\r\nIt was wrong of me, I know. But Benjamin\'s virtuous indignation was so\r\nvery virtuous that it let the spirit of mischief loose in me. I really\r\ncould not resist the temptation to outrage his sense of propriety by\r\ntaking an audaciously liberal view of the whole matter.\r\n\r\n"Gently, my good friend, gently," I said. "We must make allowances for a\r\nman who suffers under Dexter\'s infirmities, and lives Dexter\'s life. And\r\nreally we must not let our modesty lead us beyond reasonable limits. I\r\nbegin to think that I took rather a prudish view of the thing myself at\r\nthe time. A woman who respects herself, and whose whole heart is with\r\nher husband, is not so very seriously injured when a wretched crippled\r\ncreature is rude enough to put his arm around her waist. Virtuous\r\nindignation (if I may venture to say so) is sometimes very cheap\r\nindignation. Besides, I have forgiven him--and you must forgive him too.\r\nThere is no fear of his forgetting himself again, while you are with me.\r\nHis house is quite a curiosity--it is sure to interest you; the pictures\r\nalone are worth the journey. I will write to him to-day, and we will go\r\nand see him together to-morrow. We owe it to ourselves (if we don\'t\r\nowe it to Mr. Dexter) to pay this visit. If you will look about you,\r\nBenjamin, you will see that benevolence toward everybody is the great\r\nvirtue of the time we live in. Poor Mr. Dexter must have the benefit of\r\nthe prevailing fashion. Come, come, march with the age! Open your mind\r\nto the new ideas!"\r\n\r\nInstead of accepting this polite invitation, worthy old Benjamin flew at\r\nthe age we lived in like a bull at a red cloth.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the new ideas! the new ideas! By all manner of means, Valeria, let\r\nus have the new ideas! The old morality\'s all wrong, the old ways are\r\nall worn out. Let\'s march with the age we live in. Nothing comes amiss\r\nto the age we live in. The wife in England and the husband in Spain,\r\nmarried or not married living together or not living together--it\'s all\r\none to the new ideas. I\'ll go with you, Valeria; I\'ll be worthy of the\r\ngeneration I live in. When we have done with Dexter, don\'t let\'s do\r\nthings by halves. Let\'s go and get crammed with ready made science at a\r\nlecture--let\'s hear the last new professor, the man who has been behind\r\nthe scenes at Creation, and knows to a T how the world was made, and how\r\nlong it took to make it. There\'s the other fellow, too: mind we don\'t\r\nforget the modern Solomon, who has left his proverbs behind him--the\r\nbrand-new philosopher who considers the consolations of religion in\r\nthe light of harmless playthings, and who is kind enough to say that\r\nhe might have been all the happier if he could only have been\r\nchildish enough to play with them himself. Oh, the new ideas! the new\r\nideas!--what consoling, elevating, beautiful discoveries have been made\r\nby the new ideas! We were all monkeys before we were men, and molecules\r\nbefore we were monkeys! and what does it matter? And what does anything\r\nmatter to anybody? I\'m with you, Valeria, I\'m ready. The sooner the\r\nbetter. Come to Dexter! Come to Dexter!"\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you agree with me," I said. "But let us do nothing in a\r\nhurry. Three o\'clock to-morrow will be time enough for Mr. Dexter. I\r\nwill write at once and tell him to expect us. Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to clear my mind of cant," said Benjamin, sternly. "I am\r\ngoing into the library."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to read?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to read--Puss in Boots, and Jack and the Bean-stalk, and\r\nanything else I can find that doesn\'t march with the age we live in."\r\n\r\nWith that parting shot at the new ideas, my old friend left me for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHaving dispatched my note, I found myself beginning to revert, with\r\na certain feeling of anxiety, to the subject of Miserrimus Dexter\'s\r\nhealth. How had he passed through the interval of my absence from\r\nEngland? Could anybody, within my reach, tell me news of him? To inquire\r\nof Benjamin would only be to provoke a new outbreak. While I was still\r\nconsidering, the housekeeper entered the room on some domestic errand.\r\nI asked, at a venture, if she had heard anything more, while I had been\r\naway of the extraordinary person who had so seriously alarmed her on a\r\nformer occasion.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper shook her head, and looked as if she thought it in bad\r\ntaste to mention the subject at all.\r\n\r\n"About a week after you had gone away ma\'am," she said, with extreme\r\nseverity of manner, and with excessive carefulness in her choice of\r\nwords, "the Person you mention had the impudence to send a letter to\r\nyou. The messenger was informed, by my master\'s orders, that you had\r\ngone abroad, and he and his letter were both sent about their business\r\ntogether. Not long afterward, ma\'am, I happened, while drinking tea with\r\nMrs. Macallan\'s housekeeper, to hear of the Person again. He himself\r\ncalled in his chaise, at Mrs. Macallan\'s, to inquire about you there.\r\nHow he can contrive to sit, without legs to balance him, is beyond my\r\nunderstanding--but that is neither here nor there. Legs or no legs, the\r\nhousekeeper saw him, and she says, as I say, she will never forget him\r\nto her dying day. She told him (as soon as she recovered herself) of Mr.\r\nEustace\'s illness, and of you and Mrs. Macallan being in foreign parts\r\nnursing him. He went away, so the housekeeper told me, with tears in his\r\neyes, and oaths and curses on his lips--a sight shocking to see. That\'s\r\nall I know about the Person, ma\'am, and I hope to be excused if\r\nI venture to say that the subject is (for good reasons) extremely\r\ndisagreeable to me."\r\n\r\nShe made a formal courtesy, and quitted the room.\r\n\r\nLeft by myself, I felt more anxious and more uncertain than ever when I\r\nthought of the experiment that was to be tried on the next day. Making\r\ndue allowance for exaggeration, the description of Miserrimus Dexter\r\non his departure from Mrs. Macallan\'s house suggested that he had not\r\nendured my long absence very patiently, and that he was still as far\r\nas ever from giving his shattered nervous system its fair chance of\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought me Mr. Playmore\'s reply to the letter which I\r\nhad addressed to him from Paris.\r\n\r\nHe wrote very briefly, neither approving nor blaming my decision, but\r\nstrongly reiterating his opinion that I should do well to choose a\r\ncompetent witness as my companion at my coming interview with Dexter.\r\nThe most interesting part of the letter was at the end. "You must be\r\nprepared," Mr. Playmore wrote, "to see a change for the worse in Dexter.\r\nA friend of mine was with him on a matter of business a few days since,\r\nand was struck by the alteration in him. Your presence is sure to have\r\nits effect, one way or another. I can give you no instructions for\r\nmanaging him--you must be guided by the circumstances. Your own tact\r\nwill tell you whether it is wise or not to encourage him to speak of the\r\nlate Mrs. Eustace. The chances of his betraying himself all revolve (as\r\nI think) round that one topic: keep him to it if you can." To this was\r\nadded, in a postscript: "Ask Mr. Benjamin if he were near enough to the\r\nlibrary door to hear Dexter tell you of his entering the bedchamber on\r\nthe night of Mrs. Eustace Macallan\'s death."\r\n\r\nI put the question to Benjamin when we met at the luncheon-table before\r\nsetting forth for the distant suburb in which Miserrimus Dexter lived.\r\nMy old friend disapproved of the contemplated expedition as strongly as\r\never. He was unusually grave and unusually sparing of his words when he\r\nanswered me.\r\n\r\n"I am no listener," he said. "But some people have voices which insist\r\non being heard. Mr. Dexter is one of them."\r\n\r\n"Does that mean that you heard him?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"The door couldn\'t muffle him, and the wall couldn\'t muffle him,"\r\nBenjamin rejoined. "I heard him--and I thought it infamous. There!"\r\n\r\n"I may want you to do more than hear him this time," I ventured to say.\r\n"I may want you to make notes of our conversation while Mr. Dexter is\r\nspeaking to me. You used to write down what my father said, when he was\r\ndictating his letters to you. Have you got one of your little note-books\r\nto spare?"\r\n\r\nBenjamin looked up from his plate with an aspect of stern surprise.\r\n\r\n"It\'s one thing," he said, "to write under the dictation of a great\r\nmerchant, conducting a vast correspondence by which thousands of pounds\r\nchange hands in due course of post. And it\'s another thing to take down\r\nthe gibberish of a maundering mad monster who ought to be kept in a\r\ncage. Your good father, Valeria, would never have asked me to do that."\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, Benjamin; I must really ask you to do it. You may be of\r\nthe greatest possible use to me. Come, give way this once, dear, for my\r\nsake."\r\n\r\nBenjamin looked down again at his plate, with a rueful resignation which\r\ntold me that I had carried my point.\r\n\r\n"I have been tied to her apron-string all my life," I heard him grumble\r\nto himself; "and it\'s too late in the day to get loose from her how." He\r\nlooked up again at me. "I thought I had retired from business," he said;\r\n"but it seems I must turn clerk again. Well? What is the new stroke of\r\nwork that\'s expected from me this time?"\r\n\r\nThe cab was announced to be waiting for us at the gate as he asked the\r\nquestion. I rose and took his arm, and gave him a grateful kiss on his\r\nrosy old cheek.\r\n\r\n"Only two things," I said. "Sit down behind Mr. Dexter\'s chair, so that\r\nhe can\'t see you. But take care to place yourself, at the same time, so\r\nthat you can see me."\r\n\r\n"The less I see of Mr. Dexter the better I shall be pleased," growled\r\nBenjamin. "What am I to do after I have taken my place behind him?"\r\n\r\n"You are to wait until I make you a sign; and when you see it you are to\r\nbegin writing down in your note-book what Mr. Dexter is saying--and you\r\nare to go on until I make another sign, which means, Leave off!"\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Benjamin, "what\'s the sign for Begin? and what\'s the sign\r\nfor Leave off?"\r\n\r\nI was not quite prepared with an answer to this. I asked him to help me\r\nwith a hint. No! Benjamin would take no active part in the matter. He\r\nwas resigned to be employed in the capacity of passive instrument--and\r\nthere all concession ended, so far as he was concerned.\r\n\r\nLeft to my own resources, I found it no easy matter to invent a\r\ntelegraphic system which should sufficiently inform Benjamin, without\r\nawakening Dexter\'s quick suspicion. I looked into the glass to see if I\r\ncould find the necessary suggestion in anything that I wore. My earrings\r\nsupplied me with the idea of which I was in search.\r\n\r\n"I shall take care to sit in an arm-chair," I said. "When you see me\r\nrest my elbow on the chair, and lift my hand to my earring, as if I were\r\nplaying with it--write down what he says; and go on until--well, suppose\r\nwe say, until you hear me move my chair. At that sound, stop. You\r\nunderstand me?"\r\n\r\n"I understand you."\r\n\r\nWe started for Dexter\'s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL. NEMESIS AT LAST.\r\n\r\nTHE gardener opened the gate to us on this occasion. He had evidently\r\nreceived his orders in anticipation of my arrival.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Valeria?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And friend?"\r\n\r\n"And friend."\r\n\r\n"Please to step upstairs. You know the house."\r\n\r\nCrossing the hall, I stopped for a moment, and looked at a favorite\r\nwalking-cane which Benjamin still kept in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Your cane will only be in your way," I said. "Had you not better leave\r\nit here?"\r\n\r\n"My cane may be useful upstairs," retorted Benjamin, gruffly. "_I_\r\nhaven\'t forgotten what happened in the library."\r\n\r\nIt was no time to contend with him. I led the way up the stairs.\r\n\r\nArriving at the upper flight of steps, I was startled by hearing a\r\nsudden cry from the room above. It was like the cry of a person in pain;\r\nand it was twice repeated before we entered the circular antechamber.\r\nI was the first to approach the inner room, and to see the many-sided\r\nMiserrimus Dexter in another new aspect of his character.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Ariel was standing before a table, with a dish of\r\nlittle cakes placed in front of her. Round each of her wrists was tied a\r\nstring, the free ends of which (at a distance of a few yards) were held\r\nin Miserrimus Dexter\'s hands. "Try again, my beauty!" I heard him say,\r\nas I stopped on the threshold of the door. "Take a cake." At the word of\r\ncommand, Ariel submissively stretched out one arm toward the dish. Just\r\nas she touched a cake with the tips of her fingers her hand was jerked\r\naway by a pull at the string, so savagely cruel in the nimble and\r\ndevilish violence of it that I felt inclined to snatch Benjamin\'s\r\ncane out of his hand and break it over Miserrimus Dexter\'s back. Ariel\r\nsuffered the pain this time in Spartan silence. The position in which\r\nshe stood enabled her to be the first to see me at the door. She had\r\ndiscovered me. Her teeth were set; her face was flushed under the\r\nstruggle to restrain herself. Not even a sigh escaped her in my\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n"Drop the string!" I called out, indignantly "Release her, Mr. Dexter,\r\nor I shall leave the house."\r\n\r\nAt the sound of my voice he burst out with a shrill cry of welcome. His\r\neyes fastened on me with a fierce, devouring delight.\r\n\r\n"Come in! come in!" he cried. "See what I am reduced to in the maddening\r\nsuspense of waiting for you. See how I kill the time when the time parts\r\nus. Come in! come in! I am in one of my malicious humors this morning,\r\ncaused entirely, Mrs. Valeria, by my anxiety to see you. When I am in\r\nmy malicious humors I must tease something. I am teasing Ariel. Look\r\nat her! She has had nothing to eat all day, and she hasn\'t been quick\r\nenough to snatch a morsel of cake yet. You needn\'t pity her. Ariel has\r\nno nerves--I don\'t hurt her."\r\n\r\n"Ariel has no nerves," echoed the poor creature, frowning at me for\r\ninterfering between her master and herself. "He doesn\'t hurt me."\r\n\r\nI heard Benjamin beginning to swing his cane behind him.\r\n\r\n"Drop the string!" I reiterated, more vehemently than ever. "Drop it, or\r\nI shall instantly leave you."\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter\'s delicate nerves shuddered at my violence. "What a\r\nglorious voice!" he exclaimed--and dropped the string. "Take the cakes,"\r\nhe added, addressing Ariel in his most imperial manner.\r\n\r\nShe passed me, with the strings hanging from her swollen wrists, and the\r\ndish of cakes in her hand. She nodded her head at me defiantly.\r\n\r\n"Ariel has got no nerves," she repeated, proudly. "He doesn\'t hurt me."\r\n\r\n"You see," said Miserrimus Dexter, "there is no harm done--and I dropped\r\nthe strings when you told me. Don\'t _begin_ by being hard on me, Mrs.\r\nValeria, after your long absence." He paused. Benjamin, standing silent\r\nin the doorway, attracted his attention for the first time. "Who is\r\nthis?" he asked, and wheeled his chair suspiciously nearer to the door.\r\n"I know!" he cried, before I could answer. "This is the benevolent\r\ngentleman who looked like the refuge of the afflicted when I saw him\r\nlast.--You have altered for the worse since then, sir. You have stepped\r\ninto quite a new character--you personify Retributive Justice now.--Your\r\nnew protector, Mrs. Valeria--I understand!" He bowed low to Benjamin,\r\nwith ferocious irony. "Your humble servant, Mr. Retributive Justice! I\r\nhave deserved you--and I submit to you. Walk in, sir! I will take care\r\nthat your new office shall be a sinecure. This lady is the Light of\r\nmy Life. Catch me failing in respect to her if you can!" He backed his\r\nchair before Benjamin (who listened to him in contemptuous silence)\r\nuntil he reached the part of the room in which I was standing. "Your\r\nhand, Light of my Life!" he murmured in his gentlest tones. "Your\r\nhand--only to show that you have forgiven me!" I gave him my hand.\r\n"One?" he whispered, entreatingly. "Only one?" He kissed my hand once,\r\nrespectfully--and dropped it with a heavy sigh. "Ah, poor Dexter!" he\r\nsaid, pitying himself with the whole sincerity of his egotism. "A warm\r\nheart--wasted in solitude, mocked by deformity. Sad! sad! Ah, poor\r\nDexter!" He looked round again at Benjamin, with another flash of his\r\nferocious irony. "A beauteous day, sir," he said, with mock-conventional\r\ncourtesy. "Seasonable weather indeed after the late long-continued\r\nrains. Can I offer you any refreshment? Won\'t you sit down? Retributive\r\nJustice, when it is no taller than you are, looks best in a chair."\r\n\r\n"And a monkey looks best in a cage," rejoined Benjamin, enraged at the\r\nsatirical reference to his shortness of stature. "I was waiting, sir, to\r\nsee you get into your swing."\r\n\r\nThe retort produced no effect on Miserrimus Dexter: it appeared to have\r\npassed by him unheard. He had changed again; he was thoughtful, he was\r\nsubdued; his eyes were fixed on me with a sad and rapt attention. I\r\ntook the nearest arm-chair, first casting a glance at Benjamin, which\r\nhe immediately understood. He placed himself behind Dexter, at an angle\r\nwhich commanded a view of my chair. Ariel, silently devouring her cakes,\r\ncrouched on a stool at "the Master\'s" feet, and looked up at him like a\r\nfaithful dog. There was an interval of quiet and repose. I was able to\r\nobserve Miserrimus Dexter uninterruptedly for the first time since I had\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised--I was nothing less than alarmed by the change for\r\nthe worse in him since we had last met. Mr. Playmore\'s letter had not\r\nprepared me for the serious deterioration in him which I could now\r\ndiscern.\r\n\r\nHis features were pinched and worn; the whole face seemed to have wasted\r\nstrangely in substance and size since I had last seen it. The softness\r\nin his eyes was gone. Blood-red veins were intertwined all over them\r\nnow: they were set in a piteous and vacant stare. His once firm hands\r\nlooked withered; they trembled as they lay on the coverlet. The paleness\r\nof his face (exaggerated, perhaps, by the black velvet jacket that\r\nhe wore) had a sodden and sickly look--the fine outline was gone. The\r\nmultitudinous little wrinkles at the corners of his eyes had deepened.\r\nHis head sank into his shoulders when he leaned forward in his chair.\r\nYears appeared to have passed over him, instead of months, while I\r\nhad been absent from England. Remembering the medical report which\r\nMr. Playmore had given me to read--recalling the doctor\'s positively\r\ndeclared opinion that the preservation of Dexter\'s sanity depended on\r\nthe healthy condition of his nerves--I could not but feel that I had\r\ndone wisely (if I might still hope for success) in hastening my return\r\nfrom Spain. Knowing what I knew, fearing what I feared, I believed that\r\nhis time was near. I felt, when our eyes met by accident, that I was\r\nlooking at a doomed man.\r\n\r\nI pitied him.\r\n\r\nYes, yes! I know that compassion for him was utterly inconsistent with\r\nthe motive which had taken me to his house--utterly inconsistent with\r\nthe doubt, still present to my mind, whether Mr. Playmore had really\r\nwronged him in believing that his was the guilt which had compassed\r\nthe first Mrs. Eustace\'s death. I felt this: I knew him to be cruel; I\r\nbelieved him to be false. And yet I pitied him! Is there a common fund\r\nof wickedness in us all? Is the suppression or the development of that\r\nwickedness a mere question of training and temptation? And is there\r\nsomething in our deeper sympathies which mutely acknowledges this when\r\nwe feel for the wicked; when we crowd to a criminal trial; when we shake\r\nhands at parting (if we happen to be present officially) with the vilest\r\nmonster that ever swung on a gallows? It is not for me to decide. I can\r\nonly say that I pitied Miserrimus Dexter--and that he found it out.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he said, suddenly. "You see I am ill, and you feel for me.\r\nDear and good Valeria!"\r\n\r\n"This lady\'s name, sir, is Mrs. Eustace Macallan," interposed Benjamin,\r\nspeaking sternly behind him. "The next time you address her, remember,\r\nif you please, that you have no business with her Christian name."\r\n\r\nBenjamin\'s rebuke passed, like Benjamin\'s retort, unheeded and unheard.\r\nTo all appearance, Miserrimus Dexter had completely forgotten that there\r\nwas such a person in the room.\r\n\r\n"You have delighted me with the sight of you," he went on. "Add to the\r\npleasure by letting me hear your voice. Talk to me of yourself. Tell me\r\nwhat you have been doing since you left England."\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to my object to set the conversation afloat; and this\r\nwas as good a way of doing it as any other. I told him plainly how I had\r\nbeen employed during my absence.\r\n\r\n"So you are still fond of Eustace?" he said, bitterly.\r\n\r\n"I love him more dearly than ever."\r\n\r\nHe lifted his hands, and hid his face. After waiting a while, he went\r\non, speaking in an odd, muffled manner, still under cover of his hands.\r\n\r\n"And you leave Eustace in Spain," he said; "and you return to England by\r\nyourself! What made you do that?"\r\n\r\n"What made me first come here and ask you to help me, Mr. Dexter?"\r\n\r\nHe dropped his hands, and looked at me. I saw in his eyes, not amazement\r\nonly, but alarm.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible," he exclaimed, "that you won\'t let that miserable\r\nmatter rest even yet? Are you still determined to penetrate the mystery\r\nat Gleninch?"\r\n\r\n"I am still determined, Mr. Dexter; and I still hope that you may be\r\nable to help me."\r\n\r\nThe old distrust that I remembered so well darkened again over his face\r\nthe moment I said those words.\r\n\r\n"How can I help you?" he asked. "Can I alter facts?" He stopped. His\r\nface brightened again, as if some sudden sense of relief had come to\r\nhim. "I did try to help you," he went on. "I told you that Mrs. Beauly\'s\r\nabsence was a device to screen herself from suspicion; I told you that\r\nthe poison might have been given by Mrs. Beauly\'s maid. Has reflection\r\nconvinced you? Do you see something in the idea?"\r\n\r\nThis return to Mrs. Beauly gave me my first chance of leading the talk\r\nto the right topic.\r\n\r\n"I see nothing in the idea," I answered. "I see no motive. Had the maid\r\nany reason to be an enemy to the late Mrs. Eustace?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody had any reason to be an enemy to the late Mrs. Eustace!" he\r\nbroke out, loudly and vehemently. "She was all goodness, all kindness;\r\nshe never injured any human creature in thought or deed. She was a saint\r\nupon earth. Respect her memory! Let the martyr rest in her grave!" He\r\ncovered his face again with his hands, and shook and shuddered under the\r\nparoxysm of emotion that I had roused in him.\r\n\r\nAriel suddenly and softly left her stool, and approached me.\r\n\r\n"Do you see my ten claws?" she whispered, holding out her hands. "Vex\r\nthe Master again, and you will feel my ten claws on your throat!"\r\n\r\nBenjamin rose from his seat: he had seen the action, without hearing the\r\nwords. I signed to him to keep his place. Ariel returned to her stool,\r\nand looked up again at her master.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cry," she said. "Come on. Here are the strings. Tease me again.\r\nMake me screech with the smart of it."\r\n\r\nHe never answered, and never moved.\r\n\r\nAriel bent her slow mind to meet the difficulty of attracting his\r\nattention. I saw it in her frowning brows, in her colorless eyes looking\r\nat me vacantly. On a sudden, she joyfully struck the open palm of one of\r\nher hands with the fist of the other. She had triumphed. She had got an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n"Master!" she cried. "Master! You haven\'t told me a story for ever so\r\nlong. Puzzle my thick head. Make my flesh creep. Come on. A good long\r\nstory. All blood and crimes."\r\n\r\nHad she accidentally hit on the right suggestion to strike his wayward\r\nfancy? I knew his high opinion of his own skill in "dramatic narrative."\r\nI knew that one of his favorite amusements was to puzzle Ariel by\r\ntelling her stories that she could not understand. Would he wander away\r\ninto the regions of wild romance? Or would he remember that my obstinacy\r\nstill threatened him with reopening the inquiry into the tragedy at\r\nGleninch? and would he set his cunning at work to mislead me by some new\r\nstratagem? This latter course was the course which my past experience of\r\nhim suggested that he would take. But, to my surprise and alarm, I found\r\nmy past experience at fault. Ariel succeeded in diverting his mind from\r\nthe subject which had been in full possession of it the moment before\r\nshe spoke! He showed his face again. It was overspread by a broad smile\r\nof gratified self-esteem. He was weak enough now to let even Ariel find\r\nher way to his vanity. I saw it with a sense of misgiving, with a doubt\r\nwhether I had not delayed my visit until too late, which turned me cold\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter spoke--to Ariel, not to me.\r\n\r\n"Poor devil!" he said, patting her head complacently. "You don\'t\r\nunderstand a word of my stories, do you? And yet I can make the flesh\r\ncreep on your great clumsy body--and yet I can hold your muddled mind,\r\nand make you like it. Poor devil!" He leaned back serenely in his chair,\r\nand looked my way again. Would the sight of me remind him of the\r\nwords that had passed between us not a minute since? No! There was the\r\npleasantly tickled self-conceit smiling at me exactly as it had smiled\r\nat Ariel. "I excel in dramatic narrative, Mrs. Valeria," he said. "And\r\nthis creature here on the stool is a remarkable proof of it. She is\r\nquite a psychological study when I tell her one of my stories. It is\r\nreally amusing to see the half-witted wretch\'s desperate efforts to\r\nunderstand me. You shall have a specimen. I have been out of spirits\r\nwhile you were away--I haven\'t told her a story for weeks past; I will\r\ntell her one now. Don\'t suppose it\'s any effort to me! My invention is\r\ninexhaustible. You are sure to be amused--you are naturally serious--but\r\nyou are sure to be amused. I am naturally serious too; and I always\r\nlaugh at her."\r\n\r\nAriel clapped her great shapeless hands. "He always laughs at me!" she\r\nsaid, with a proud look of superiority directed straight at me.\r\n\r\nI was at a loss, seriously at a loss, what to do.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak which I had provoked in leading him to speak of the late\r\nMrs. Eustace warned me to be careful, and to wait for my opportunity\r\nbefore I reverted to _that_ subject. How else could I turn the\r\nconversation so as to lead him, little by little, toward the betrayal of\r\nthe secrets which he was keeping from me? In this uncertainty, one thing\r\nonly seemed to be plain. To let him tell his story would be simply to\r\nlet him waste the precious minutes. With a vivid remembrance of Ariel\'s\r\n"ten claws," I decided, nevertheless on discouraging Dexter\'s new whim\r\nat every possible opportunity and by every means in my power.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mrs. Valeria," he began, loudly and loftily, "listen. Now, Ariel,\r\nbring your brains to a focus. I improvise poetry; I improvise fiction.\r\nWe will begin with the good old formula of the fairy stories. Once upon\r\na time--"\r\n\r\nI was waiting for my opportunity to interrupt him when he interrupted\r\nhimself. He stopped, with a bewildered look. He put his hand to his\r\nhead, and passed it backward and forward over his forehead. He laughed\r\nfeebly.\r\n\r\n"I seem to want rousing," he said\r\n\r\nWas his mind gone? There had been no signs of it until I had unhappily\r\nstirred his memory of the dead mistress of Gleninch. Was the weakness\r\nwhich I had already noticed, was the bewilderment which I now saw,\r\nattributable to the influence of a passing disturbance only? In other\r\nwords, had I witnessed nothing more serious than a first warning to him\r\nand to us? Would he soon recover himself, if we were patient, and gave\r\nhim time? Even Benjamin was interested at last; I saw him trying to look\r\nat Dexter around the corner of the chair. Even Ariel was surprised and\r\nuneasy. She had no dark glances to cast at me now.\r\n\r\nWe all waited to see what he would do, to hear what he would say, next.\r\n\r\n"My harp!" he cried. "Music will rouse me."\r\n\r\nAriel brought him his harp.\r\n\r\n"Master," she said, wonderingly, "what\'s come to you?"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand, commanding her to be silent.\r\n\r\n"Ode to Invention," he announced, loftily, addressing himself to me.\r\n"Poetry and music improvised by Dexter. Silence! Attention!"\r\n\r\nHis fingers wandered feebly over the harpstrings, awakening no melody,\r\nsuggesting no words. In a little while his hand dropped; his head sank\r\nforward gently, and rested on the frame of the harp. I started to my\r\nfeet, and approached him. Was it a sleep? or was it a swoon?\r\n\r\nI touched his arm, and called to him by his name.\r\n\r\nAriel instantly stepped between us, with a threatening look at me. At\r\nthe same moment Miserrimus Dexter raised his head. My voice had reached\r\nhim. He looked at me with a curious contemplative quietness in his eyes\r\nwhich I had never seen in them before.\r\n\r\n"Take away the harp," he said to Ariel, speaking in languid tones, like\r\na man who was very weary.\r\n\r\nThe mischievous, half-witted creature--in sheer stupidity or in\r\ndownright malice, I am not sure which--irritated him once more.\r\n\r\n"Why, Master?" she asked, staring at him with the harp hugged in her\r\narms. "What\'s come to you? where is the story?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want the story," I interposed. "I have many things to say to\r\nMr. Dexter which I have not said yet."\r\n\r\nAriel lifted her heavy hand. "You will have it!" she said, and advanced\r\ntoward me. At the same moment the Master\'s voice stopped her.\r\n\r\n"Put away the harp, you fool!" he repeated, sternly. "And wait for the\r\nstory until I choose to tell it."\r\n\r\nShe took the harp submissively back to its place at the end of the room.\r\nMiserrimus Dexter moved his chair a little closer to mine. "I know what\r\nwill rouse me," he said, confidentially. "Exercise will do it. I have\r\nhad no exercise lately. Wait a little, and you will see."\r\n\r\nHe put his hands on the machinery of the chair, and started on his\r\ncustomary course down the room. Here again the ominous change in him\r\nshowed itself under a new form. The pace at which he traveled was not\r\nthe furious pace that I remembered; the chair no longer rushed under him\r\non rumbling and whistling wheels. It went, but it went slowly. Up the\r\nroom and down the room he painfully urged it--and then he stopped for\r\nwant of breath.\r\n\r\nWe followed him. Ariel was first, and Benjamin was by my side. He\r\nmotioned impatiently to both of them to stand back, and to let me\r\napproach him alone.\r\n\r\n"I\'m out of practice," he said, faintly. "I hadn\'t the heart to make the\r\nwheels roar and the floor tremble while you were away."\r\n\r\nWho would not have pitied him? Who would have remembered his misdeeds\r\nat that moment? Even Ariel felt it. I heard her beginning to whine\r\nand whimper behind me. The magician who alone could rouse the dormant\r\nsensibilities in her nature had awakened them now by his neglect. Her\r\nfatal cry was heard again, in mournful, moaning tones--\r\n\r\n"What\'s come to you, Master? Where\'s the story?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind her," I whispered to him. "You want the fresh air. Send for\r\nthe gardener. Let us take a drive in your pony-chaise."\r\n\r\nIt was useless. Ariel would be noticed. The mournful cry came once\r\nmore--\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the story? where\'s the story?"\r\n\r\nThe sinking spirit leaped up in Dexter again.\r\n\r\n"You wretch! you fiend!" he cried, whirling his chair around, and facing\r\nher. "The story is coming. I _can_ tell it! I _will_ tell it! Wine! You\r\nwhimpering idiot, get me the wine. Why didn\'t I think of it before? The\r\nkingly Burgundy! that\'s what I want, Valeria, to set my invention alight\r\nand flaming in my head. Glasses for everybody! Honor to the King of the\r\nVintages--the Royal Clos Vougeot!"\r\n\r\nAriel opened the cupboard in the alcove, and produced the wine and the\r\nhigh Venetian glasses. Dexter drained his gobletful of Burgundy at a\r\ndraught; he forced us to drink (or at least to pretend to drink) with\r\nhim. Even Ariel had her share this time, and emptied her glass in\r\nrivalry with her master. The powerful wine mounted almost instantly to\r\nher weak head. She began to sing hoarsely a song of her own devising,\r\nin imitation of Dexter. It was nothing but the repetition, the endless\r\nmechanical repetition, of her demand for the story--"Tell us the story.\r\nMaster! master! tell us the story!" Absorbed over his wine, the Master\r\nsilently filled his goblet for the second time. Benjamin whispered to\r\nme while his eye was off us, "Take my advice, Valeria, for once; let us\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"One last effort," I whispered back. "Only one!"\r\n\r\nAriel went drowsily on with her song--\r\n\r\n"Tell us the story. Master! master! tell us the story."\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter looked up from his glass. The generous stimulant was\r\nbeginning to do its work. I saw the color rising in his face. I saw\r\nthe bright intelligence flashing again in his eyes. The Burgundy _had_\r\nroused him! The good wine stood my friend, and offered me a last chance!\r\n\r\n"No story," I said. "I want to talk to you, Mr. Dexter. I am not in the\r\nhumor for a story."\r\n\r\n"Not in the humor?" he repeated, with a gleam of the old impish irony\r\nshowing itself again in his face. "That\'s an excuse. I see what it is!\r\nYou think my invention is gone--and you are not frank enough to confess\r\nit. I\'ll show you you\'re wrong. I\'ll show you that Dexter is himself\r\nagain. Silence, you Ariel, or you shall leave the room! I have got it,\r\nMrs. Valeria, all laid out here, with scenes and characters complete."\r\nHe touched his forehead, and looked at me with a furtive and smiling\r\ncunning before he added his next words. "It\'s the very thing to interest\r\nyou, my fair friend. It\'s the story of a Mistress and a Maid. Come back\r\nto the fire and hear it."\r\n\r\nThe Story of a Mistress and a Maid? If that meant anything, it meant the\r\nstory of Mrs. Beauly and her maid, told in disguise.\r\n\r\nThe title, and the look which had escaped him when he announced it,\r\nrevived the hope that was well-nigh dead in me. He had rallied at last.\r\nHe was again in possession of his natural foresight and his natural\r\ncunning. Under pretense of telling Ariel her story, he was evidently\r\nabout to make the attempt to mislead me for the second time. The\r\nconclusion was irresistible. To use his own words--Dexter was himself\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI took Benjamin\'s arm as we followed him back to the fire-place in the\r\nmiddle of the room.\r\n\r\n"There is a chance for me yet," I whispered. "Don\'t forget the signals."\r\n\r\nWe returned to the places which we had already occupied. Ariel cast\r\nanother threatening look at me. She had just sense enough left, after\r\nemptying her goblet of wine, to be on the watch for a new interruption\r\non my part. I took care, of course, that nothing of the sort should\r\nhappen. I was now as eager as Ariel to hear the story. The subject was\r\nfull of snares for the narrator. At any moment, in the excitement of\r\nspeaking, Dexter\'s memory of the true events might show itself reflected\r\nin the circumstances of the fiction. At any moment he might betray\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe looked around him, and began.\r\n\r\n"My public, are you seated? My public, are you ready?" he asked,\r\ngayly. "Your face a little more this way," he added, in his softest\r\nand tenderest tones, motioning to me to turn my full face toward him.\r\n"Surely I am not asking too much? You look at the meanest creature that\r\ncrawls--look at Me. Let me find my inspiration in your eyes. Let me feed\r\nmy hungry admiration on your form. Come, have one little pitying smile\r\nleft for the man whose happiness you have wrecked. Thank you, Light of\r\nmy Life, thank you!" He kissed his hand to me, and threw himself back\r\nluxuriously in his chair. "The story," he resumed. "The story at last!\r\nIn what form shall I cast it? In the dramatic form--the oldest way, the\r\ntruest way, the shortest way of telling a story! Title first. A\r\nshort title, a taking title: \'Mistress and Maid.\' Scene, the land of\r\nromance--Italy. Time, the age of romance--the fifteenth century. Ha!\r\nlook at Ariel. She knows no more about the fifteenth century than the\r\ncat in the kitchen, and yet she is interested already. Happy Ariel!"\r\n\r\nAriel looked at me again, in the double intoxication of the wine and the\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n"I know no more than the cat in the kitchen," she repeated, with a broad\r\ngrin of gratified vanity. "I am \'happy Ariel!\' What are you?"\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter laughed uproariously.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you?" he said. "Isn\'t she fun?--Persons of the Drama."\r\nhe resumed: "three in number. Women only. Angelica, a noble lady; noble\r\nalike in spirit and in birth. Cunegonda, a beautiful devil in woman\'s\r\nform. Damoride, her unfortunate maid. First scene: a dark vaulted\r\nchamber in a castle. Time, evening. The owls are hooting in the wood;\r\nthe frogs are croaking in the marsh.--Look at Ariel! Her flesh creeps;\r\nshe shudders audibly. Admirable Ariel!"\r\n\r\nMy rival in the Master\'s favor eyed me defiantly. "Admirable Ariel!"\r\nshe repeated, in drowsy accents. Miserrimus Dexter paused to take up\r\nhis goblet of Burgundy--placed close at hand on a little sliding table\r\nattached to his chair. I watched him narrowly as he sipped the wine. The\r\nflush was still mounting in his face; the light was still brightening\r\nin his eyes. He set down his glass again, with a jovial smack of his\r\nlips--and went on:\r\n\r\n"Persons present in the vaulted chamber: Cunegonda and Damoride.\r\nCunegonda speaks. \'Damoride!\' \'Madam?\' \'Who lies ill in the chamber\r\nabove us?\' \'Madam, the noble lady Angelica.\' (A pause. Cunegonda speaks\r\nagain.) \'Damoride!\' \'Madam?\' \'How does Angelica like you?\' \'Madam, the\r\nnoble lady, sweet and good to all who approach her, is sweet and good to\r\nme.\' \'Have you attended on her, Damoride?\' \'Sometimes, madam, when the\r\nnurse was weary.\' \'Has she taken her healing medicine from your hand.\'\r\n\'Once or twice, madam, when I happened to be by.\' \'Damoride, take this\r\nkey and open the casket on the table there.\' (Damoride obeys.) \'Do\r\nyou see a green vial in the casket?\' \'I see it, madam.\' \'Take it out.\'\r\n(Damoride obeys.) \'Do you see a liquid in the green vial? can you\r\nguess what it is?\' \'No, madam.\' \'Shall I tell you?\' (Damoride bows\r\nrespectfully ) \'Poison is in the vial.\' (Damoride starts; she shrinks\r\nfrom the poison; she would fain put it aside. Her mistress signs to her\r\nto keep it in her hand; her mistress speaks.) \'Damoride, I have told you\r\none of my secrets; shall I tell you another?\' (Damoride waits, fearing\r\nwhat is to come. Her mistress speaks.) \'I hate the Lady Angelica. Her\r\nlife stands between me and the joy of my heart. You hold her life in\r\nyour hand.\' (Damoride drops on her knees; she is a devout person;\r\nshe crosses herself, and then she speaks.) \'Mistress, you terrify me.\r\nMistress, what do I hear?\' (Cunegonda advances, stands over her, looks\r\ndown on her with terrible eyes, whispers the next words.) \'Damoride! the\r\nLady Angelica must die--and I must not be suspected. The Lady Angelica\r\nmust die--and by your hand.\'"\r\n\r\nHe paused again. To sip the wine once more? No; to drink a deep draught\r\nof it this time.\r\n\r\nWas the stimulant beginning to fail him already?\r\n\r\nI looked at him attentively as he laid himself back again in his chair\r\nto consider for a moment before he went on.\r\n\r\nThe flush on his face was as deep as ever; but the brightness in his\r\neyes was beginning to fade already. I had noticed that he spoke more and\r\nmore slowly as he advanced to the later dialogue of the scene. Was he\r\nfeeling the effort of invention already? Had the time come when the wine\r\nhad done all that the wine could do for him?\r\n\r\nWe waited. Ariel sat watching him with vacantly staring eyes and\r\nvacantly open mouth. Ben jamin, impenetrably expecting the signal, kept\r\nhis open note-book on his knee, covered by his hand. Miserrimus Dexter\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n"Damoride hears those terrible words; Damoride clasps her hands in\r\nentreaty. \'Oh, madam! madam! how can I kill the dear and noble lady?\r\nWhat motive have I for harming her?\' Cunegonda answers, \'You have the\r\nmotive of obeying Me.\' (Damoride falls with her face on the floor at\r\nher mistress\'s feet.) \'Madam, I cannot do it! Madam, I dare not do\r\nit!\' Cunegonda answers, \'You run no risk: I have my plan for diverting\r\ndiscovery from myself, and my plan for diverting discovery from you.\'\r\nDamoride repeats, \'I cannot do it! I dare not do it!\' Cunegonda\'s eyes\r\nflash lightnings of rage. She takes from its place of concealment in her\r\nbosom--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped in the middle of the sentence, and put his hand to his\r\nhead--not like a man in pain, but like a man who had lost his idea.\r\n\r\nWould it be well if I tried to help him to recover his idea? or would it\r\nbe wiser (if I could only do it) to keep silence?\r\n\r\nI could see the drift of his story plainly enough. His object, under\r\nthe thin disguise of the Italian romance, was to meet my unanswerable\r\nobjection to suspecting Mrs. Beauly\'s maid--the objection that the woman\r\nhad no motive for committing herself to an act of murder. If he could\r\npractically contradict this, by discovering a motive which I should be\r\nobliged to admit, his end would be gained. Those inquiries which I had\r\npledged myself to pursue--those inquiries which might, at any moment,\r\ntake a turn that directly concerned him--would, in that case, be\r\nsuccessfully diverted from the right to the wrong person. The innocent\r\nmaid would set my strictest scrutiny at defiance; and Dexter would be\r\nsafely shielded behind her.\r\n\r\nI determined to give him time. Not a word passed my lips.\r\n\r\nThe minutes followed each other. I waited in the deepest anxiety. It was\r\na trying and a critical moment. If he succeeded in inventing a probable\r\nmotive, and in shaping it neatly to suit the purpose of his story, he\r\nwould prove, by that act alone, that there were reserves of mental\r\npower still left in him which the practiced eye of the Scotch doctor had\r\nfailed to see. But the question was--would he do it?\r\n\r\nHe did it! Not in a new way; not in a convincing way; not without a\r\npainfully evident effort. Still, well done or ill done, he found a\r\nmotive for the maid.\r\n\r\n"Cunegonda," he resumed, "takes from its place of concealment in\r\nher bosom a written paper, and unfolds it. \'Look at this,\' she says.\r\nDamoride looks at the paper, and sinks again at her mistress\'s feet in a\r\nparoxysm of horror and despair. Cunegonda is in possession of a shameful\r\nsecret in the maid\'s past life. Cunegonda can say to her, \'Choose\r\nyour alternative. Either submit to an exposure which disgraces you\r\nand--disgraces your parents forever--or make up your mind to obey Me.\'\r\nDamoride might submit to the disgrace if it only affected herself. But\r\nher parents are honest people; she cannot disgrace her parents. She is\r\ndriven to her last refuge--there is no hope of melting the hard heart of\r\nCunegonda. Her only resource is to raise difficulties; she tries to show\r\nthat there are obstacles between her and the crime. \'Madam! madam!\' she\r\ncries; \'how can I do it, when the nurse is there to see me?\' Cunegonda\r\nanswers, \'Sometimes the nurse sleeps; sometimes the nurse is away.\'\r\nDamoride still persists. \'Madam! madam! the door is kept locked, and the\r\nnurse has got the key.\'"\r\n\r\nThe key! I instantly thought of the missing key at Gleninch. Had he\r\nthought of it too? He certainly checked himself as the word escaped him.\r\nI resolved to make the signal. I rested my elbow on the arm of my chair,\r\nand played with my earring. Benjamin took out his pencil and arranged\r\nhis note-book so that Ariel could not see what he was about if she\r\nhappened to look his way.\r\n\r\nWe waited until it pleased Miserrimus Dexter to proceed. The interval\r\nwas a long one. His hand went up again to his forehead. A duller and\r\nduller look was palpably stealing over his eyes. When he did speak, it\r\nwas not to go on with the narrative, but to put a question.\r\n\r\n"Where did I leave off?" he asked.\r\n\r\nMy hopes sank again as rapidly as they had risen. I managed to answer\r\nhim, however, without showing any change in my manner.\r\n\r\n"You left off," I said, "where Damoride was speaking to Cunegonda--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" he interposed. "And what did she say?"\r\n\r\n"She said, \'The door is kept locked, and the nurse has got the key.\'"\r\n\r\nHe instantly leaned forward in his chair.\r\n\r\n"No!" he answered, vehemently. "You\'re wrong. \'Key?\' Nonsense! I never\r\nsaid \'Key.\'"\r\n\r\n"I thought you did, Mr. Dexter."\r\n\r\n"I never did! I said something else, and you have forgotten it."\r\n\r\nI refrained from disputing with him, in fear of what might follow. We\r\nwaited again. Benjamin, sullenly submitting to my caprices, had taken\r\ndown the questions and answers that had passed between Dexter and\r\nmyself. He still mechanically kept his page open, and still held his\r\npencil in readiness to go on. Ariel, quietly submitting to the drowsy\r\ninfluence of the wine while Dexter\'s voice was in her ears, felt\r\nuneasily the change to silence. She glanced round her restlessly; she\r\nlifted her eyes to "the Master."\r\n\r\nThere he sat, silent, with his hand to his head, still struggling to\r\nmarshal his wandering thoughts, still trying to see light through the\r\ndarkness that was closing round him.\r\n\r\n"Master!" cried Ariel, piteously. "What\'s become of the story?"\r\n\r\nHe started as if she had awakened him out of a sleep; he shook his\r\nhead impatiently, as though he wanted to throw off some oppression that\r\nweighed upon it.\r\n\r\n"Patience, patience," he said. "The story is going on again."\r\n\r\nHe dashed at it desperately; he picked up the first lost thread that\r\nfell in his way, reckless whether it were the right thread or the wrong\r\none:\r\n\r\n"Damoride fell on her knees. She burst into tears. She said--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked about him with vacant eyes.\r\n\r\n"What name did I give the other woman?" he asked, not putting the\r\nquestion to me, or to either of my companions: asking it of himself, or\r\nasking it of the empty air.\r\n\r\n"You called the other woman Cunegonda," I said.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of my voice his eyes turned slowly--turned on me, and yet\r\nfailed to look at me. Dull and absent, still and changeless, they were\r\neyes that seemed to be fixed on something far away. Even his voice\r\nwas altered when he spoke next. It had dropped to a quiet, vacant,\r\nmonotonous tone. I had heard something like it while I was watching by\r\nmy husband\'s bedside, at the time of his delirium--when Eustace\'s mind\r\nappeared to be too weary to follow his speech. Was the end so near as\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n"I called her Cunegonda," he repeated. "And I called the other--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped once more.\r\n\r\n"And you called the other Damoride," I said.\r\n\r\nAriel looked up at him with a broad stare of bewilderment. She pulled\r\nimpatiently at the sleeve of his jacket to attract his notice.\r\n\r\n"Is this the story, Master?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe answered without looking at her, his changeless eyes still fixed, as\r\nit seemed, on something far away.\r\n\r\n"This is the story," he said, absently. "But why Cunegonda? why\r\nDamoride? Why not Mistress and Maid? It\'s easier to remember Mistress\r\nand Maid--"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated; he shivered as he tried to raise himself in his chair.\r\nThen he seemed to rally "What did the Maid say to the Mistress?" he\r\nmuttered. "What? what? what?" He hesitated again. Then something seemed\r\nto dawn upon him unexpectedly. Was it some new thought that had struck\r\nhim? or some lost thought that he had recovered? Impossible to say.\r\n\r\nHe went on, suddenly and rapidly went on, in these strange words:\r\n\r\n"\'The letter,\' the Maid said; \'the letter. Oh my heart. Every word\r\na dagger. A dagger in my heart. Oh, you letter. Horrible, horrible,\r\nhorrible letter.\'"\r\n\r\nWhat, in God\'s name, was he talking about? What did those words mean?\r\n\r\nWas he unconsciously pursuing his faint and fragmentary recollections\r\nof a past time at Gleninch, under the delusion that he was going on with\r\nthe story? In the wreck of the other faculties, was memory the last to\r\nsink? Was the truth, the dreadful truth, glimmering on me dimly through\r\nthe awful shadow cast before it by the advancing, eclipse of the brain?\r\nMy breath failed me; a nameless horror crept through my whole being.\r\n\r\nBenjamin, with his pencil in his hand, cast one warning look at me.\r\nAriel was quiet and satisfied. "Go on, Master," was all she said. "I\r\nlike it! I like it! Go on with the story."\r\n\r\nHe went on--like a man sleeping with his eyes open, and talking in his\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n"The Maid said to the Mistress. No--the Mistress said to the Maid. The\r\nMistress said, \'Show him the letter. Must, must, must do it.\' The Maid\r\nsaid, \'No. Mustn\'t do it. Shan\'t show it. Stuff. Nonsense. Let him\r\nsuffer. We can get him off. Show it? No. Let the worst come to the\r\nworst. Show it, then.\' The Mistress said--" He paused, and waved his\r\nhand rapidly to and fro before his eyes, as if he were brushing away\r\nsome visionary confusion or entanglement. "Which was it last?" he\r\nsaid--"Mistress or Maid? Mistress? No. Maid speaks, of course. Loud.\r\nPositive. \'You scoundrels. Keep away from that table. The Diary\'s there.\r\nNumber Nine, Caldershaws. Ask for Dandie. You shan\'t have the Diary. A\r\nsecret in your ear. The Diary will hang, him. I won\'t have him hanged.\r\nHow dare you touch my chair? My chair is Me! How dare you touch Me?\'"\r\n\r\nThe last words burst on me like a gleam of light! I had read them in\r\nthe Report of the Trial--in the evidence of the sheriff\'s officer.\r\nMiserrimus Dexter had spoken in those very terms when he had tried\r\nvainly to prevent the men from seizing my husband\'s papers, and when the\r\nmen had pushed his chair out of the room. There was no doubt now of what\r\nhis memory was busy with. The mystery at Gleninch! His last backward\r\nflight of thought circled feebly and more feebly nearer and nearer to\r\nthe mystery at Gleninch!\r\n\r\nAriel aroused him again. She had no mercy on him; she insisted on\r\nhearing the whole story.\r\n\r\n"Why do you stop, Master? Get along with it! get along with it! Tell us\r\nquick--what did the Missus say to the Maid?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed feebly, and tried to imitate her.\r\n\r\n"\'What did the Missus say to the Maid?\'" he repeated. His laugh died\r\naway. He went on speaking, more and more vacantly, more and more\r\nrapidly. "The Mistress said to the Maid. We\'ve got him off. What about\r\nthe letter? Burn it now. No fire in the grate. No matches in the box.\r\nHouse topsy-turvy. Servants all gone. Tear it up. Shake it up in the\r\nbasket. Along with the rest. Shake it up. Waste paper. Throw it away.\r\nGone forever. Oh, Sara, Sara, Sara! Gone forever.\'"\r\n\r\nAriel clapped her hands, and mimicked him in her turn.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, Sara, Sara, Sara!\'" she repeated. "\'Gone forever.\' That\'s prime,\r\nMaster! Tell us--who was Sara?"\r\n\r\nHis lips moved, but his voice sank so low that I could barely hear him.\r\nHe began again, with the old melancholy refrain:\r\n\r\n"The Maid said to the Mistress. No--the Mistress said to the Maid--"\r\nHe stopped abruptly, and raised himself erect in the chair; he threw\r\nup both his hands above his head, and burst into a frightful screaming\r\nlaugh. "Aha-ha-ha-ha! How funny! Why don\'t you laugh? Funny, funny,\r\nfunny, funny. Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha--"\r\n\r\nHe fell back in the chair. The shrill and dreadful laugh died away into\r\na low sob. Then there was one long, deep, wearily drawn breath. Then\r\nnothing but a mute, vacant face turned up to the ceiling, with eyes\r\nthat looked blindly, with lips parted in a senseless, changeless grin.\r\nNemesis at last! The foretold doom had fallen on him. The night had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nBut one feeling animated me when the first shock was over. Even the\r\nhorror of that fearful sight seemed only to increase the pity that I\r\nfelt for the stricken wretch. I started impulsively to my feet. Seeing\r\nnothing, thinking of nothing but the helpless figure in the chair, I\r\nsprang forward to raise him, to revive him, to recall him (if such a\r\nthing might still be possible) to himself. At the first step that I\r\ntook, I felt hands on me--I was violently drawn back. "Are you blind?"\r\ncried Benjamin, dragging me nearer and nearer to the door. "Look there!"\r\n\r\nHe pointed; and I looked.\r\n\r\nAriel had been beforehand with me. She had raised her master in the\r\nchair; she had got one arm around him. In her free hand she brandished\r\nan Indian club, torn from a "trophy" of Oriental weapons that ornamented\r\nthe wall over the fire-place. The creature was transfigured! Her dull\r\neyes glared like the eyes of a wild animal. She gnashed her teeth in\r\nthe frenzy that possessed her. "You have done this!" she shouted to me,\r\nwaving the club furiously around and around over her head. "Come near\r\nhim, and I\'ll dash your brains out! I\'ll mash you till there\'s not a\r\nwhole bone left in your skin!" Benjamin, still holding me with one hand\r\nopened the door with the other. I let him do with me as he would; Ariel\r\nfascinated me; I could look at nothing but Ariel. Her frenzy vanished as\r\nshe saw us retreating. She dropped the club; she threw both arms around\r\nhim, and nestled her head on his bosom, and sobbed and wept over him.\r\n"Master! master! They shan\'t vex you any more. Look up again. Laugh\r\nat me as you used to do. Say, \'Ariel, you\'re a fool.\' Be like yourself\r\nagain!" I was forced into the next room. I heard a long, low, wailing\r\ncry of misery from the poor creature who loved him with a dog\'s fidelity\r\nand a woman\'s devotion. The heavy door was closed between us. I was in\r\nthe quiet antechamber, crying over that piteous sight; clinging to my\r\nkind old friend as helpless and as useless as a child.\r\n\r\nBenjamin turned the key in the lock.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no use in crying about it," he said, quietly. "It would be more\r\nto the purpose, Valeria, if you thanked God that you have got out of\r\nthat room safe and sound. Come with me."\r\n\r\nHe took the key out of the lock, and led me downstairs into the hall.\r\nAfter a little consideration, he opened the front door of the house. The\r\ngardener was still quietly at work in the grounds.\r\n\r\n"Your master is taken ill," Benjamin said; "and the woman who attends\r\nupon him has lost her head--if she ever had a head to lose. Where does\r\nthe nearest doctor live?"\r\n\r\nThe man\'s devotion to Dexter showed itself as the woman\'s devotion had\r\nshown itself--in the man\'s rough way. He threw down his spade with an\r\noath.\r\n\r\n"The Master taken bad?" he said. "I\'ll fetch the doctor. I shall find\r\nhim sooner than you will."\r\n\r\n"Tell the doctor to bring a man with him," Benjamin added. "He may want\r\nhelp."\r\n\r\nThe gardener turned around sternly.\r\n\r\n"_I\'m_ the man," he said. "Nobody shall help but me."\r\n\r\nHe left us. I sat down on one of the chairs in the hall, and did my best\r\nto compose myself. Benjamin walked to and fro, deep in thought. "Both of\r\nthem fond of him," I heard my old friend say to himself. "Half monkey,\r\nhalf man--and both of them fond of him. _That_ beats me."\r\n\r\nThe gardener returned with the doctor--a quiet, dark, resolute man.\r\nBenjamin advanced to meet them. "I have got the key," he said. "Shall I\r\ngo upstairs with you?"\r\n\r\nWithout answering, the doctor drew Benjamin aside into a corner of the\r\nhall. The two talked together in low voices. At the end of it the doctor\r\nsaid, "Give me the key. You can be of no use; you will only irritate\r\nher."\r\n\r\nWith those words he beckoned to the gardener. He was about to lead the\r\nway up the stairs when I ventured to stop him.\r\n\r\n"May I stay in the hall, sir?" I said. "I am very anxious to hear how it\r\nends."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me for a moment before he replied.\r\n\r\n"You had better go home, madam," he said. "Is the gardener acquainted\r\nwith your address?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very well. I will let you know how it ends by means of the gardener.\r\nTake my advice. Go home."\r\n\r\nBenjamin placed my arm in his. I looked back, and saw the doctor and\r\nthe gardener ascending the stairs together on their way to the locked-up\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Never mind the doctor," I whispered. "Let\'s wait in the garden."\r\n\r\nBenjamin would not hear of deceiving the doctor. "I mean to take you\r\nhome," he said. I looked at him in amazement. My old friend, who was all\r\nmeekness and submission so long as there was no emergency to try him,\r\nnow showed the dormant reserve of manly spirit and decision in his\r\nnature as he had never (in my experience) shown it yet. He led me into\r\nthe garden. We had kept our cab: it was waiting for us at the gate.\r\n\r\nOn our way home Benjamin produced his note-book.\r\n\r\n"What\'s to be done, my dear, with the gibberish that I have written\r\nhere?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Have you written it all down?" I asked, in surprise.\r\n\r\n"When I undertake a duty, I do it," he answered. "You never gave me the\r\nsignal to leave off--you never moved your chair. I have written every\r\nword of it. What shall I do? Throw it out of the cab window?"\r\n\r\n"Give it to me."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know yet. I will ask Mr. Playmore."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI. MR. PLAYMORE IN A NEW CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nBY that night\'s post--although I was far from being fit to make the\r\nexertion--I wrote to Mr. Playmore, to tell him what had taken place, and\r\nto beg for his earliest assistance and advice.\r\n\r\nThe notes in Benjamin\'s book were partly written in shorthand, and were,\r\non that account, of no use to me in their existing condition. At my\r\nrequest, he made two fair copies. One of the copies I inclosed in my\r\nletter to Mr. Playmore. The other I laid by me, on my bedside table,\r\nwhen I went to rest.\r\n\r\nOver and over again, through the long hours of the wakeful night, I read\r\nand re-read the last words which had dropped from Miserrimus Dexter\'s\r\nlips. Was it possible to interpret them to any useful purpose? At the\r\nvery outset they seemed to set interpretation at defiance. After trying\r\nvainly to solve the hopeless problem, I did at last what I might as well\r\nhave done at first--I threw down the paper in despair. Where were my\r\nbright visions of discovery and success now? Scattered to the winds!\r\nWas there the faintest chance of the stricken man\'s return to reason? I\r\nremembered too well what I had seen to hope for it. The closing lines of\r\nthe medical report which I had read in Mr. Playmore\'s office recurred\r\nto my memory in the stillness of the night--"When the catastrophe has\r\nhappened, his friends can entertain no hope of his cure: the balance\r\nonce lost, will be lost for life."\r\n\r\nThe confirmation of that terrible sentence was not long in reaching\r\nme. On the next morning the gardener brought a note containing the\r\ninformation which the doctor had promised to give me on the previous\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMiserrimus Dexter and Ariel were still where Benjamin and I had\r\nleft them together--in the long room. They were watched by skilled\r\nattendants, waiting the decision of Dexter\'s nearest relative (a younger\r\nbrother, who lived in the country, and who had been communicated with by\r\ntelegraph). It had been found impossible to part the faithful Ariel\r\nfrom her master without using the bodily restraints adopted in cases of\r\nraging insanity. The doctor and the gardener (both unusually strong men)\r\nhad failed to hold the poor creature when they first attempted to remove\r\nher on entering the room. Directly they permitted her to return to her\r\nmaster the frenzy vanished: she was perfectly quiet and contented so\r\nlong as they let her sit at his feet and look at him.\r\n\r\nSad as this was, the report of Miserrimus Dexter\'s condition was more\r\nmelancholy still.\r\n\r\n"My patient is in a state of absolute imbecility"--those were the words\r\nin the doctor\'s letter; and the gardener\'s simple narrative confirmed\r\nthem as the truest words that could have been used. He was utterly\r\nunconscious of poor Ariel\'s devotion to him--he did not even appear to\r\nknow that she was present in the room. For hours together he remained in\r\na state of utter lethargy in his chair. He showed an animal interest in\r\nhis meals, and a greedy animal enjoyment of eating and drinking as much\r\nas he could get--and that was all. "This morning," the honest gardener\r\nsaid to me at parting, "we thought he seemed to wake up a bit. Looked\r\nabout him, you know, and made queer signs with his hands. I couldn\'t\r\nmake out what he meant; no more could the doctor. _She_ knew, poor\r\nthing--She did. Went and got him his harp, and put his hand up to it.\r\nLord bless you! no use. He couldn\'t play no more than I can. Twanged\r\nat it anyhow, and grinned and gabbled to himself. No: he\'ll never come\r\nright again. Any person can see that, without the doctor to help \'em.\r\nEnjoys his meals, as I told you; and that\'s all. It would be the best\r\nthing that could happen if it would please God to take him. There\'s no\r\nmore to be said. I wish you good-morning, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nHe went away with the tears in his eyes; and he left me, I own it, with\r\nthe tears in mine.\r\n\r\nAn hour later there came some news which revived me. I received a\r\ntelegram from Mr. Playmore, expressed in these welcome words: "Obliged\r\nto go to London by to-night\'s mail train. Expect me to breakfast\r\nto-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the lawyer at our breakfast-table duly followed the\r\nappearance of his telegram. His first words cheered me. To my infinite\r\nsurprise and relief, he was far from sharing the despondent view which I\r\ntook of my position.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t deny," he said, "that there are some serious obstacles in\r\nyour way. But I should never have called here before attending to my\r\nprofessional business in London if Mr. Benjamin\'s notes had not produced\r\na very strong impression on my mind. For the first time, as _I_ think,\r\nyou really have a prospect of success. For the first time, I feel\r\njustified in offering (under certain restrictions) to help you. That\r\nmiserable wretch, in the collapse of his intelligence, has done what he\r\nwould never have done in the possession of his sense and his cunning--he\r\nhas let us see the first precious glimmerings of the light of truth."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure it _is_ the truth?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"In two important particulars," he answered, "I know it to be the truth.\r\nYour idea about him is the right one. His memory (as you suppose) was\r\nthe least injured of his faculties, and was the last to give way under\r\nthe strain of trying to tell that story. I believe his memory to have\r\nbeen speaking to you (unconsciously to himself) in all that he said from\r\nthe moment when the first reference to \'the letter\' escaped him to the\r\nend."\r\n\r\n"But what does the reference to the letter mean?" I asked. "For my part,\r\nI am entirely in the dark about it."\r\n\r\n"So am I," he answered, frankly. "The chief one among the obstacles\r\nwhich I mentioned just now is the obstacle presented by that same\r\n\'letter.\' The late Mrs. Eustace must have been connected with it in some\r\nway, or Dexter would never have spoken of it as \'a dagger in his heart\';\r\nDexter would never have coupled her name with the words which describe\r\nthe tearing up of the letter and the throwing of it away. I can arrive\r\nwith some certainty at this result, and I can get no further. I have no\r\nmore idea than you have of who wrote the letter, or of what was\r\nwritten in it. If we are ever to make that discovery--probably the\r\nmost important discovery of all--we must dispatch our first inquiries\r\na distance of three thousand miles. In plain English, my dear lady, we\r\nmust send to America."\r\n\r\nThis, naturally enough, took me completely by surprise. I waited eagerly\r\nto hear why we were to send to America.\r\n\r\n"It rests with you," he proceeded, "when you hear what I have to tell\r\nyou, to say whether you will go to the expense of sending a man to New\r\nYork, or not. I can find the right man for the purpose; and I estimate\r\nthe expense (including a telegram)--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind the expense!" I interposed, losing all patience with the\r\neminently Scotch view of the case which put my purse in the first place\r\nof importance. "I don\'t care for the expense; I want to know what you\r\nhave discovered."\r\n\r\nHe smiled. "She doesn\'t care for the expense," he said to himself,\r\npleasantly. "How like a woman!"\r\n\r\nI might have retorted, "He thinks of the expense before he thinks of\r\nanything else. How like a Scotchman!" As it was, I was too anxious to\r\nbe witty. I only drummed impatiently with my fingers on the table, and\r\nsaid, "Tell me! tell me!"\r\n\r\nHe took out the fair copy from Benjamin\'s note-book which I had sent to\r\nhim, and showed me these among Dexter\'s closing words: "What about the\r\nletter? Burn it now. No fire in the grate. No matches in the box. House\r\ntopsy-turvy. Servants all gone."\r\n\r\n"Do you really understand what those words mean?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I look back into my own experience," he answered, "and I understand\r\nperfectly what the words mean."\r\n\r\n"And can you make me understand them too?"\r\n\r\n"Easily. In those incomprehensible sentences Dexter\'s memory has\r\ncorrectly recalled certain facts. I have only to tell you the facts,\r\nand you will be as wise as I am. At the time of the Trial, your husband\r\nsurprised and distressed me by insisting on the instant dismissal of\r\nall the household servants at Gleninch. I was instructed to pay them\r\na quarter\'s wages in advance, to give them the excellent written\r\ncharacters which their good conduct thoroughly deserved, and to see\r\nthe house clear of them at an hour\'s notice. Eustace\'s motive for this\r\nsummary proceeding was much the same motive which animated his conduct\r\ntoward you. \'If I am ever to return to Gleninch,\' he said, \'I cannot\r\nface my honest servants after the infamy of having stood my trial for\r\nmurder.\' There was his reason. Nothing that I could say to him, poor\r\nfellow, shook his resolution. I dismissed the servants accordingly. At\r\nan hour\'s notice, they quitted the house, leaving their work for the day\r\nall undone. The only persons placed in charge of Gleninch were persons\r\nwho lived on the outskirts of the park--that is to say, the lodge-keeper\r\nand his wife and daughter. On the last day of the Trial I instructed\r\nthe daughter to do her best to make the rooms tidy. She was a good girl\r\nenough, but she had no experience as a housemaid: it would never enter\r\nher head to lay the bedroom fires ready for lighting, or to replenish\r\nthe empty match-boxes. Those chance words that dropped from Dexter\r\nwould, no doubt, exactly describe the state of his room when he returned\r\nto Gleninch, with the prisoner and his mother, from Edinburgh. That\r\nhe tore up the mysterious letter in his bedroom, and (finding no means\r\nimmediately at hand for burning it) that he threw the fragments into\r\nthe empty grate, or into the waste-paper basket, seems to be the most\r\nreasonable conclusion that we can draw from what we know. In any case,\r\nhe would not have much time to think about it. Everything was done in a\r\nhurry on that day. Eustace and his mother, accompanied by Dexter, left\r\nfor England the same evening by the night train. I myself locked up the\r\nhouse, and gave the keys to the lodge-keeper. It was understood that\r\nhe was to look after the preservation of the reception-rooms on the\r\nground-floor; and that his wife and daughter were to perform the same\r\nservice between them in the rooms upstairs. On receiving your letter,\r\nI drove at once to Gleninch to question the old woman on the subject of\r\nthe bedrooms, and of Dexter\'s room especially. She remembered the time\r\nwhen the house was shut up by associating it with the time when she was\r\nconfined to her bed by an attack of sciatica. She had not crossed the\r\nlodge door, she was sure, for at least a week (if not longer after\r\nGleninch had been left in charge of her husband and herself). Whatever\r\nwas done in the way of keeping the bedrooms aired and tidy during her\r\nillness was done by her daughter. She, and she only, must have disposed\r\nof any letter which might have been lying about in Dexter\'s room. Not a\r\nvestige of torn paper, as I can myself certify, is to be discovered in\r\nany part of the room now. Where did the girl find the fragments of the\r\nletter? and what did she do with them? Those are the questions (if you\r\napprove of it) which we must send three thousand miles away to ask--for\r\nthis sufficient reason, that the lodge-keeper\'s daughter was married\r\nmore than a year since, and that she is settled with her husband in\r\nbusiness at New York. It rests with you to decide what is to be done.\r\nDon\'t let me mislead you with false hopes! Don\'t let me tempt you to\r\nthrow away your money! Even if this woman does remember what she\r\ndid with the torn paper, the chances, at this distance of time, are\r\nenormously against our ever recovering a single morsel of it. Be in no\r\nhaste to decide. I have my work to do in the city--I can give you the\r\nwhole day to think it over."\r\n\r\n"Send the man to New York by the next steamer," I said. "There is my\r\ndecision, Mr. Playmore, without keeping you waiting for it!"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, in grave disapproval of my impetuosity. In my former\r\ninterview with him we had never once touched on the question of money.\r\nI was now, for the first time, to make acquaintance with Mr. Playmore on\r\nthe purely Scotch side of his character.\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t even know what it will cost you!" he exclaimed, taking\r\nout his pocket-book with the air of a man who was equally startled and\r\nscandalized. "Wait till I tot it up," he said, "in English and American\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t wait! I want to make more discoveries!"\r\n\r\nHe took no notice of my interruption; he went on impenetrably with his\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n"The man will go second-class, and will take a return-ticket. Very well.\r\nHis ticket includes his food; and (being, thank God, a teetotaler) he\r\nwon\'t waste your money in buying liquor on board. Arrived at New York,\r\nhe will go to a cheap German house, where he will, as I am credibly\r\ninformed, be boarded and lodged at the rate--"\r\n\r\nBy this time (my patience being completely worn out) I had taken my\r\ncheck-book from the table-drawer, had signed my name, and had handed the\r\nblank check across the table to my legal adviser.\r\n\r\n"Fill it in with whatever the man wants," I said. "And for Heaven\'s sake\r\nlet us get back to Dexter!"\r\n\r\nMr. Playmore fell back in his chair, and lifted his hands and eyes to\r\nthe ceiling. I was not in the least impressed by that solemn appeal\r\nto the unseen powers of arithmetic and money. I insisted positively on\r\nbeing fed with more information.\r\n\r\n"Listen to this," I went on, reading from Benjamin\'s notes. "What did\r\nDexter mean when he said, \'Number Nine, Caldershaws. Ask for Dandie. You\r\nshan\'t have the Diary. A secret in your ear. The Diary will hang him?\'\r\nHow came Dexter to know what was in my husband\'s Diary? And what does he\r\nmean by \'Number Nine, Caldershaws,\' and the rest of it? Facts again?"\r\n\r\n"Facts again!" Mr. Playmore answered, "muddled up together, as you may\r\nsay--but positive facts for all that. Caldershaws, you must know, is one\r\nof the most disreputable districts in Edinburgh. One of my clerks (whom\r\nI am in the habit of employing confidentially) volunteered to inquire\r\nfor \'Dandie\' at \'Number Nine.\' It was a ticklish business in every\r\nway; and my man wisely took a person with him who was known in the\r\nneighborhood. \'Number Nine\' turned out to be (ostensibly) a shop for the\r\nsale of rags and old iron; and \'Dandie\' was suspected of trading now\r\nand then, additionally, as a receiver of stolen goods. Thanks to the\r\ninfluence of his companion, backed by a bank-note (which can be repaid,\r\nby the way, out of the fund for the American expenses), my clerk\r\nsucceeded is making the fellow speak. Not to trouble you with needless\r\ndetails, the result in substance was this: A fortnight or more before\r\nthe date of Mrs. Eustace\'s death, \'Dandie\' made two keys from wax models\r\nsupplied to him by a new customer. The mystery observed in the matter\r\nby the agent who managed it excited Dandie\'s distrust. He had the\r\nman privately watched before he delivered the keys; and he ended in\r\ndiscovering that his customer was--Miserrimus Dexter. Wait a little!\r\nI have not done yet. Add to this information Dexter\'s incomprehensible\r\nknowledge of the contents of your husband\'s diary, and the product\r\nis--that the wax models sent to the old-iron shop in Caldershaws were\r\nmodels taken by theft from the key of the Diary and the key of the\r\ntable-drawer in which it was kept. I have my own idea of the revelations\r\nthat are still to come if this matter is properly followed up. Never\r\nmind going into that at present. Dexter (I tell you again) is answerable\r\nfor the late Mrs. Eustace\'s death. _How_ he is answerable I believe you\r\nare in a fair way of finding out. And, more than that, I say now, what I\r\ncould not venture to say before--it is a duty toward Justice, as well\r\nas a duty toward your husband, to bring the truth to light. As for the\r\ndifficulties to be encountered, I don\'t think they need daunt you. The\r\ngreatest difficulties give way in the end, when they are attacked by the\r\nunited alliance of patience resolution--_and_ economy."\r\n\r\nWith a strong emphasis on the last words, my worthy adviser, mindful of\r\nthe flight of time and the claims of business, rose to take his leave.\r\n\r\n"One word more," I said, as he held out his hand. "Can you manage to\r\nsee Miserrimus Dexter before you go back to Edinburgh? From what the\r\ngardener told me, his brother must be with him by this time. It would be\r\na relief to me to hear the latest news of him, and to hear it from you."\r\n\r\n"It is part of my business in London to see him," said Mr. Playmore.\r\n"But mind! I have no hope of his recovery; I only wish to satisfy myself\r\nthat his brother is able and willing to take care of him. So far as _we_\r\nare concerned, Mrs. Eustace, that unhappy man has said his last words."\r\n\r\nHe opened the door--stopped--considered--and come back to me.\r\n\r\n"With regard to that matter of sending the agent to America," he\r\nresumed--"I propose to have the honor of submitting to you a brief\r\nabstract--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Playmore!"\r\n\r\n"A brief abstract in writing, Mrs. Eustace, of the estimated expenses of\r\nthe whole proceeding. You will be good enough maturely to consider the\r\nsame, making any remarks on it, tending to economy, which may suggest\r\nthemselves to your mind at the time. And you will further oblige me, if\r\nyou approve of the abstract, by yourself filling in the blank space on\r\nyour check with the needful amount in words and figures. No, madam! I\r\nreally cannot justify it to my conscience to carry about my person\r\nany such loose and reckless document as a blank check. There\'s a total\r\ndisregard of the first claims of prudence and economy implied in this\r\nsmall slip of paper which is nothing less than a flat contradiction of\r\nthe principles that have governed my whole life. I can\'t submit to flat\r\ncontradiction. Good-morning, Mrs. Eustace--good-morning."\r\n\r\nHe laid my check on the table with a low bow, and left me. Among the\r\ncurious developments of human stupidity which occasionally present\r\nthemselves to view, surely the least excusable is the stupidity which,\r\nto this day, persists in wondering why the Scotch succeed so well in\r\nlife!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII. MORE SURPRISES.\r\n\r\nThe same evening I received my "abstract" by the hands of a clerk.\r\n\r\nIt was an intensely characteristic document. My expenses were\r\nremorselessly calculated downward to shillings and even to pence; and\r\nour unfortunate messenger\'s instructions in respect to his expenditure\r\nwere reduced to a nicety which must have made his life in America\r\nnothing less than a burden to him. In mercy to the man, I took the\r\nliberty, when I wrote back to Mr. Playmore, of slightly increasing the\r\nindicated amount of the figures which were to appear on the check. I\r\nought to have better known the correspondent whom I had to deal with.\r\nMr. Playmore\'s reply (informing me that our emissary had started on his\r\nvoyage) returned a receipt in due form, and the whole of the surplus\r\nmoney, to the last farthing!\r\n\r\nA few hurried lines accompanied the "abstract," and stated the result of\r\nthe lawyer\'s visit to Miserrimus Dexter.\r\n\r\nThere was no change for the better--there was no change at all. Mr.\r\nDexter, the brother, had arrived at the house accompanied by a medical\r\nman accustomed to the charge of the insane. The new doctor declined to\r\ngive any definite opinion on the case until he had studied it carefully\r\nwith plenty of time at his disposal. It had been accordingly arranged\r\nthat he should remove Miserrimus Dexter to the asylum of which he was\r\nthe proprietor as soon as the preparations for receiving the patient\r\ncould be completed. The one difficulty that still remained to be met\r\nrelated to the disposal of the faithful creature who had never left her\r\nmaster, night or day, since the catastrophe had happened. Ariel had no\r\nfriends and no money. The proprietor of the asylum could not be expected\r\nto receive her without the customary payment; and Mr. Dexter\'s brother\r\n"regretted to say that he was not rich enough to find the money." A\r\nforcible separation from the one human being whom she loved, and a\r\nremoval in the character of a pauper to a public asylum--such was\r\nthe prospect which awaited the unfortunate creature unless some one\r\ninterfered in her favor before the end of the week.\r\n\r\nUnder these sad circumstances, good Mr. Playmore--passing over the\r\nclaims of economy in favor of the claims of humanity--suggested that\r\nwe should privately start a subscription, and offered to head the list\r\nliberally himself.\r\n\r\nI must have written all these pages to very little purpose if it is\r\nnecessary for me to add that I instantly sent a letter to Mr. Dexter,\r\nthe brother, undertaking to be answerable for whatever money was to\r\nbe required while the subscriptions were being collected, and only\r\nstipulating that when Miserrimus Dexter was removed to the asylum, Ariel\r\nshould accompany him. This was readily conceded. But serious objections\r\nwere raised when I further requested that she might be permitted to\r\nattend on her master in the asylum as she had attended on him in the\r\nhouse. The rules of the establishment forbade it, and the universal\r\npractice in such cases forbade it, and so on, and so on. However, by\r\ndint of perseverance and persuasion, I so far carried my point as to\r\ngain a reasonable concession. During certain hours in the day, and under\r\ncertain wise restrictions, Ariel was to be allowed the privilege of\r\nwaiting on the Master in his room, as well as of accompanying him when\r\nhe was brought out in his chair to take the air in the garden. For the\r\nhonor of humanity, let me add that the liability which I had undertaken\r\nmade no very serious demands on my resources. Placed in Benjamin\'s\r\ncharge, our subscription-list prospered. Friends, and even strangers\r\nsometimes, opened their hearts and their purses when they heard Ariel\'s\r\nmelancholy story.\r\n\r\nThe day which followed the day of Mr. Playmore\'s visit brought me news\r\nfrom Spain, in a letter from my mother-in-law. To describe what I felt\r\nwhen I broke the seal and read the first lines is simply impossible. Let\r\nMrs. Macallan be heard on this occasion in my place.\r\n\r\nThus she wrote:\r\n\r\n"Prepare yourself, my dearest Valeria, for a delightful surprise.\r\nEustace has justified my confidence in him. When he returns to England,\r\nhe returns--if you will let him--to his wife.\r\n\r\n"This resolution, let me hasten to assure you, has not been brought\r\nabout by any persuasions of mine. It is the natural outgrowth of your\r\nhusband\'s gratitude and your husband\'s love. The first words he said\r\nto me, when he was able to speak, were these: \'If I live to return to\r\nEngland, and if I go to Valeria, do you think she will forgive me?\' We\r\ncan only leave it to you, my dear, to give the answer. If you love us,\r\nanswer us by return of post.\r\n\r\n"Having now told you what he said when I first informed him that you had\r\nbeen his nurse--and remember, if it seem very little, that he is still\r\ntoo weak to speak except with difficulty--I shall purposely keep my\r\nletter back for a few days. My object is to give him time to think,\r\nand to frankly tell you of it if the interval produce any change in his\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n"Three days have passed, and there is no change. He has but one feeling\r\nnow--he longs for the day which is to unite him again to his wife.\r\n\r\n"But there is something else connected with Eustace that you ought to\r\nknow, and that I ought to tell you.\r\n\r\n"Greatly as time and suffering have altered him in many respects, there\r\nis no change, Valeria, in the aversion--the horror I may even say--with\r\nwhich he views your idea of inquiring anew into the circumstances which\r\nattended the lamentable death of his first wife. It makes no difference\r\nto him that you are only animated by a desire to serve his interests.\r\n\'Has she given up that idea? Are you positively sure she has given up\r\nthat idea?\' Over and over again he has put these questions to me. I have\r\nanswered--what else could I do in the miserably feeble state in which he\r\nstill lies?--I have answered in such a manner as to soothe and satisfy\r\nhim. I have said, \'Relieve your mind of all anxiety on that subject:\r\nValeria has no choice but to give up the idea; the obstacles in her way\r\nhave proved to be insurmountable--the obstacles have conquered her.\'\r\nThis, if you remember, was what I really believed would happen when you\r\nand I spoke of that painful topic; and I have heard nothing from you\r\nsince which has tended to shake my opinion in the smallest degree. If\r\nI am right (as I pray God I may be) in the view that I take, you h ave\r\nonly to confirm me in your reply, and all will be well. In the other\r\nevent--that is to say, if you are still determined to persevere in\r\nyour hopeless project--then make up your mind to face the result. Set\r\nEustace\'s prejudices at defiance in this particular, and you lose your\r\nhold on his gratitude, his penitence, and his love--you will, in my\r\nbelief, never see him again.\r\n\r\n"I express myself strongly, in your own interests, my dear, and for your\r\nown sake. When you reply, write a few lines to Eustace, inclosed in your\r\nletter to me.\r\n\r\n"As for the date of our departure, it is still impossible for me to give\r\nyou any definite information. Eustace recovers very slowly; the doctor\r\nhas not yet allowed him to leave his bed; and when we do travel we must\r\njourney by easy stages. It will be at least six weeks, at the earliest,\r\nbefore we can hope to be back again in dear Old England.\r\n\r\n                              "Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n                              "CATHERINE MACALLAN."\r\n\r\nI laid down the letter, and did my best (vainly enough for some time)\r\nto compose my spirits. To understand the position in which I now found\r\nmyself, it is only necessary to remember one circumstance: the messenger\r\nto whom we had committed our inquiries was at that moment crossing the\r\nAtlantic on his way to New York.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done?\r\n\r\nI hesitated. Shocking as it may seem to some people, I hesitated. There\r\nwas really no need to hurry my decision. I had the whole day before me.\r\n\r\nI went out and took a wretched, lonely walk, and turned the matter over\r\nin my mind. I came home again, and turned the matter over once more by\r\nthe fireside. To offend and repel my darling when he was returning to\r\nme, penitently returning of his own free will, was what no woman in my\r\nposition, and feeling as I did, could under any earthly circumstances\r\nhave brought herself to do. And yet, on the other hand, how in Heaven\'s\r\nname could I give up my grand enterprise at the very time when even wise\r\nand prudent Mr. Playmore saw such a prospect of succeeding in it that\r\nhe had actually volunteered to help me? Placed between those two cruel\r\nalternatives, which could I choose? Think of your own frailties, and\r\nhave some mercy on mine. I turned my back on both the alternatives.\r\nThose two agreeable fiends, Prevarication and Deceit, took me, as it\r\nwere, softly by the hand: "Don\'t commit yourself either way, my dear,"\r\nthey said, in their most persuasive manner. "Write just enough to\r\ncompose your mother-in-law and to satisfy your husband. You have got\r\ntime before you. Wait and see if Time doesn\'t stand your friend, and get\r\nyou out of the difficulty."\r\n\r\nInfamous advice! And yet I took it--I, who had been well brought up, and\r\nwho ought to have known better. You who read this shameful confession\r\nwould have known better, I am sure. _You_ are not included, in the\r\nPrayer-book category, among the "miserable sinners."\r\n\r\nWell! well! let me have virtue enough to tell the truth. In writing to\r\nmy mother-in-law, I informed her that it had been found necessary to\r\nremove Miserrimus Dexter to an asylum--and I left her to draw her own\r\nconclusions from that fact, unenlightened by so much as one word of\r\nadditional information. In the same way, I told my husband a part of the\r\ntruth, and no more. I said I forgave him with all my heart--and I did!\r\nI said he had only to come to me, and I would receive him with open\r\narms--and so I would! As for the rest, let me say with Hamlet--"The rest\r\nis silence."\r\n\r\nHaving dispatched my unworthy letters, I found myself growing restless,\r\nand feeling the want of a change. It would be necessary to wait at least\r\neight or nine days before we could hope to hear by telegraph from New\r\nYork. I bade farewell for a time to my dear and admirable Benjamin, and\r\nbetook myself to my old home in the North, at the vicarage of my uncle\r\nStarkweather. My journey to Spain to nurse Eustace had made my peace\r\nwith my worthy relatives; we had exchanged friendly letters; and I had\r\npromised to be their guest as soon as it was possible for me to leave\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nI passed a quiet and (all things considered) a happy time among the old\r\nscenes. I visited once more the bank by the river-side, where Eustace\r\nand I had first met. I walked again on the lawn and loitered through the\r\nshrubbery--those favorite haunts in which we had so often talked over\r\nour troubles, and so often forgotten them in a kiss. How sadly and\r\nstrangely had our lives been parted since that time! How uncertain still\r\nwas the fortune which the future had in store for us!\r\n\r\nThe associations amid which I was now living had their softening effect\r\non my heart, their elevating influence over my mind. I reproached\r\nmyself, bitterly reproached myself, for not having written more fully\r\nand frankly to Eustace. Why had I hesitated to sacrifice to him my hopes\r\nand my interests in the coming investigation? _He_ had not hesitated,\r\npoor fellow--_his_ first thought was the thought of his wife!\r\n\r\nI had passed a fortnight with my uncle and aunt before I heard\r\nagain from Mr. Playmore. When a letter from him arrived at last, it\r\ndisappointed me indescribably. A telegram from our messenger informed us\r\nthat the lodge-keeper\'s daughter and her husband had left New York, and\r\nthat he was still in search of a trace of them.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done but to wait as patiently as we could,\r\non the chance of hearing better news. I remained in the North, by Mr.\r\nPlaymore\'s advice, so as to be within an easy journey to Edinburgh--in\r\ncase it might be necessary for me to consult him personally. Three more\r\nweeks of weary expectation passed before a second letter reached me.\r\nThis time it was impossible to say whether the news were good or bad.\r\nIt might have been either--it was simply bewildering. Even Mr.\r\nPlaymore himself was taken by surprise. These were the last wonderful\r\nwords--limited of course by considerations of economy--which reached us\r\n(by telegram) from our agent in America:\r\n\r\n"Open the dust-heap at Gleninch."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII. AT LAST!\r\n\r\nMY letter from Mr. Playmore, inclosing the agent\'s extraordinary\r\ntelegram, was not inspired by the sanguine view of our prospects which\r\nhe had expressed to me when we met at Benjamin\'s house.\r\n\r\n"If the telegram mean anything," he wrote, "it means that the fragments\r\nof the torn letter have been cast into the housemaid\'s bucket (along\r\nwith the dust, the ashes, and the rest of the litter in the room), and\r\nhave been emptied on the dust-heap at Gleninch. Since this was done,\r\nthe accumulated refuse collected from the periodical cleansings of the\r\nhouse, during a term of nearly three years--including, of course, the\r\nashes from the fires kept burning, for the greater part of the year, in\r\nthe library and the picture-gallery--have been poured upon the heap, and\r\nhave buried the precious morsels of paper deeper and deeper, day by day.\r\nEven if we have a fair chance of finding these fragments, what hope can\r\nwe feel, at this distance of time, of recovering them with the writing\r\nin a state of preservation? I shall be glad to hear, by return of post\r\nif possible, how the matter strikes you. If you could make it convenient\r\nto consult with me personally in Edinburgh, we should save time,\r\nwhen time may be of serious importance to us. While you are at Doctor\r\nStarkweather\'s you are within easy reach of this place. Please think of\r\nit."\r\n\r\nI thought of it seriously enough. The foremost question which I had to\r\nconsider was the question of my husband.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the mother and son from Spain had been so long delayed,\r\nby the surgeon\'s orders, that the travelers had only advanced on their\r\nhomeward journey as far as Bordeaux, when I had last heard from Mrs.\r\nMacallan three or four days since. Allowing for an interval of repose at\r\nBordeaux, and for the slow rate at which they would be compelled to\r\nmove afterward, I might still expect them to arrive in England some time\r\nbefore a letter from the agent in America could reach Mr. Playmore.\r\nHow, in this position of affairs, I could contrive to join the lawyer in\r\nEdinburgh, after meeting my husband in London, it was not easy to see.\r\nThe wise and the right way, as I thought, was to tell Mr. Playmore\r\nfrankly that I was not mistress of my Own movements, and that he had\r\nbetter address his next letter to me at Benjamin\'s house.\r\n\r\nWriting to my legal adviser in this sense, I had a word of my own to add\r\non the subject of the torn letter.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of my father\'s life I had traveled with him in Italy,\r\nand I had seen in the Museum at Naples the wonderful relics of a bygone\r\ntime discovered among the ruins of Pompeii. By way of encouraging Mr.\r\nPlaymore, I now reminded him that the eruption which had overwhelmed the\r\ntown had preserved, for more than sixteen hundred years, such perishable\r\nthings as the straw in which pottery had been packed; the paintings on\r\nhouse walls; the dresses worn by the inhabitants; and (most noticeable\r\nof all, in our case) a piece of ancient paper, still attached to the\r\nvolcanic ashes which had fallen over it. If these discoveries had been\r\nmade after a lapse of sixteen centuries, under a layer of dust and ashes\r\non a large scale, surely we might hope to meet with similar cases of\r\npreservation, after a lapse of three or four years only, under a layer\r\nof dust and ashes on a small scale. Taking for granted (what was perhaps\r\ndoubtful enough) that the fragments of the letter could be recovered, my\r\nown conviction was that the writing on them, though it might be faded,\r\nwould certainly still be legible. The very accumulations which Mr.\r\nPlaymore deplored would be the means of preserving them from the rain\r\nand the damp. With these modest hints I closed my letter; and thus for\r\nonce, thanks to my Continental experience, I was able to instruct my\r\nlawyer!\r\n\r\nAnother day passed; and I heard nothing of the travelers.\r\n\r\nI began to feel anxious. I made my preparations for my journey southward\r\novernight; and I resolved to start for London the next day--unless I\r\nheard of some change in Mrs. Macallan\'s traveling arrangements in the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\nThe post of the next morning decided my course of action. It brought me\r\na letter from my mother-in-law, which added one more to the memorable\r\ndates in my domestic calendar.\r\n\r\nEustace and his mother had advanced as far as Paris on their homeward\r\njourney, when a cruel disaster had befallen them. The fatigues of\r\ntraveling, and the excitement of his anticipated meeting with me, had\r\nproved together to be too much for my husband. He had held out as far as\r\nParis with the greatest difficulty; and he was now confined to his bed\r\nagain, struck down by a relapse. The doctors, this time, had no fear\r\nfor his life, provided that his patience would support him through a\r\nlengthened period of the most absolute repose.\r\n\r\n"It now rests with you, Valeria," Mrs. Macallan wrote, "to fortify and\r\ncomfort Eustace under this new calamity. Do not suppose that he has ever\r\nblamed or thought of blaming you for leaving him with me in Spain,\r\nas soon as he was declared to be out of danger. \'It was _I_ who left\r\n_her,_\' he said to me, when we first talked about it; \'and it is my\r\nwife\'s right to expect that I should go back to her.\' Those were his\r\nwords, my dear; and he has done all he can to abide by them. Helpless in\r\nhis bed, he now asks you to take the will for the deed, and to join him\r\nin Paris. I think I know you well enough, my child, to be sure that you\r\nwill do this; and I need only add one word of caution, before I close my\r\nletter. Avoid all reference, not only to the Trial (you will do that of\r\nyour own accord), but even to our house at Gleninch. You will understand\r\nhow he feels, in his present state of nervous depression, when I tell\r\nyou that I should never have ventured on asking you to join him here,\r\nif your letter had not informed me that your visits to Dexter were at\r\nan end. Would you believe it?--his horror of anything which recalls our\r\npast troubles is still so vivid that he has actually asked me to give my\r\nconsent to selling Gleninch!"\r\n\r\nSo Eustace\'s mother wrote of him. But she had not trusted entirely\r\nto her own powers of persuasion. A slip of paper was inclosed in her\r\nletter, containing these two lines, traced in pencil--oh, so feebly and\r\nso wearily!--by my poor darling himself:\r\n\r\n"I am too weak to travel any further, Valeria. Will you come to me and\r\nforgive me?" A few pencil-marks followed; but they were illegible. The\r\nwriting of those two short sentences had exhausted him.\r\n\r\nIt is not saying much for myself, I know--but, having confessed it when\r\nI was wrong, let me, at least, record it when I did what was right--I\r\ndecided instantly on giving up all further connection with the recovery\r\nof the torn letter. If Eustace asked me the question, I was resolved to\r\nbe able to answer truly: "I have made the sacrifice that assures your\r\ntranquillity. When resignation was hardest, I have humbled my obstinate\r\nspirit, and I have given way for my husband\'s sake."\r\n\r\nThere was half an hour to spare before I left the vicarage for the\r\nrailway station. In that interval I wrote again to Mr. Playmore, telling\r\nhim plainly what my position was, and withdrawing, at once and forever,\r\nfrom all share in investigating the mystery which lay hidden under the\r\ndust-heap at Gleninch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV. OUR NEW HONEYMOON.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be disguised or denied that my spirits were depressed on my\r\njourney to London.\r\n\r\nTo resign the one cherished purpose of my life, when I had suffered\r\nso much in pursuing it, and when I had (to all appearance) so nearly\r\nreached the realization of my hopes, was putting to a hard trial a\r\nwoman\'s fortitude and a woman\'s sense of duty. Still, even if the\r\nopportunity had been offered to me, I would not have recalled my letter\r\nto Mr. Playmore. "It is done, and well done," I said to myself; "and I\r\nhave only to wait a day to be reconciled to it--when I give my husband\r\nmy first kiss."\r\n\r\nI had planned and hoped to reach London in time to start for Paris by\r\nthe night-mail. But the train was twice delayed on the long journey\r\nfrom the North; and there was no help for it but to sleep at Benjamin\'s\r\nvilla, and to defer my departure until the morning.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, impossible for me to warn my old friend of the change\r\nin my plans. My arrival took him by surprise. I found him alone in his\r\nlibrary, with a wonderful illumination of lamps and candles, absorbed\r\nover some morsels of torn paper scattered on the table before him.\r\n\r\n"What in the world are you about?" I asked.\r\n\r\nBenjamin blushed--I was going to say, like a young girl; but young girls\r\nhave given up blushing in these latter days of the age we live in.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing, nothing!" he said, confusedly. "Don\'t notice it."\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hand to brush the morsels of paper off the table.\r\nThose morsels raised a sudden suspicion in my mind. I stopped him.\r\n\r\n"You have heard from Mr. Playmore!" I said. "Tell me the truth,\r\nBenjamin. Yes or no?"\r\n\r\nBenjamin blushed a shade deeper, and answered, "Yes."\r\n\r\n"Where is the letter?"\r\n\r\n"I mustn\'t show it to you, Valeria."\r\n\r\nThis (need I say it?) made me determined to see the letter. My best way\r\nof persuading Benjamin to show it to me was to tell him of the sacrifice\r\nthat I had made to my husband\'s wishes. "I have no further voice in\r\nthe matter," I added, when I had done. "It now rests entirely with Mr.\r\nPlaymore to go on or to give up; and this is my last opportunity of\r\ndiscovering what he really thinks about it. Don\'t I deserve some little\r\nindulgence? Have I no claim to look at the letter?"\r\n\r\nBenjamin was too much surprised, and too much pleased with me, when he\r\nheard what had happened, to be able to resist my entreaties. He gave me\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\nMr. Playmore wrote to appeal confidentially to Benjamin as a commercial\r\nman. In the long course of his occupation in business, it was just\r\npossible that he might have heard of cases in which documents have been\r\nput together again after having been torn up by design or by accident.\r\nEven if his experience failed in this particular, he might be able to\r\nrefer to some authority in London who would be capable of giving an\r\nopinion on the subject. By way of explaining his strange request, Mr.\r\nPlaymore reverted to the notes which Benjamin had taken at Miserrimus\r\nDexter\'s house, and informed him of the serious importance of "the\r\ngibberish" which he had reported under protest. The letter closed by\r\nrecommending that any correspondence which ensued should be kept a\r\nsecret from me--on the ground that it might excite false hopes in my\r\nmind if I were informed of it.\r\n\r\nI now understood the tone which my worthy adviser had adopted in writing\r\nto me. His interest in the recovery of the letter was evidently so\r\noverpowering that common prudence compelled him to conceal it from me,\r\nin case of ultimate failure. This did not look as if Mr. Playmore was\r\nlikely to give up the investigation on my withdrawal from it. I glanced\r\nagain at the fragments of paper on Benjamin\'s table, with an interest in\r\nthem which I had not felt yet.\r\n\r\n"Has anything been found at Gleninch?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No," said Benjamin. "I have only been trying experiments with a letter\r\nof my own, before I wrote to Mr. Playmore."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you have torn up the letter yourself, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. And, to make it all the more difficult to put them together again,\r\nI shook up the pieces in a basket. It\'s a childish thing to do, my dear,\r\nat my age--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, looking very much ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n"Well," I went on; "and have you succeeded in putting your letter\r\ntogether again?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not very easy, Valeria. But I have made a beginning. It\'s the\r\nsame principle as the principle in the \'Puzzles\' which we used to put\r\ntogether when I was a boy. Only get one central bit of it right, and the\r\nrest of the Puzzle falls into its place in a longer or a shorter time.\r\nPlease don\'t tell anybody, my dear. People might say I was in my dotage.\r\nTo think of that gibberish in my note-book having a meaning in it, after\r\nall! I only got Mr. Playmore\'s letter this morning; and--I am really\r\nalmost ashamed to mention it--I have been trying experiments on torn\r\nletters, off and on, ever since. You won\'t tell upon me, will you?"\r\n\r\nI answered the dear old man by a hearty embrace. Now that he had lost\r\nhis steady moral balance, and had caught the infection of my enthusiasm,\r\nI loved him better than ever.\r\n\r\nBut I was not quite happy, though I tried to appear so. Struggle against\r\nit as I might, I felt a little mortified when I remembered that I had\r\nresigned all further connection with the search for the letter at such\r\na time as this. My one comfort was to think of Eustace. My one\r\nencouragement was to keep my mind fixed as constantly as possible on the\r\nbright change for the better that now appeared in the domestic prospect.\r\nHere, at least, there was no disaster to fear; here I could honestly\r\nfeel that I had triumphed. My husband had come back to me of his own\r\nfree will; he had not given way, under the hard weight of evidence--he\r\nhad yielded to the nobler influences of his gratitude and his love. And\r\nI had taken him to my heart again--not because I had made discoveries\r\nwhich left him no other alternative than to live with me, but because I\r\nbelieved in the better mind that had come to him, and loved and trusted\r\nhim without reserve. Was it not worth some sacrifice to have arrived at\r\nthis result! True--most true! And yet I was a little out of spirits. Ah,\r\nwell! well! the remedy was within a day\'s journey. The sooner I was with\r\nEustace the better.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning I left London for Paris by the tidal-train.\r\nBenjamin accompanied me to the Terminus.\r\n\r\n"I shall write to Edinburgh by to-day\'s post," he said, in the interval\r\nbefore the train moved out of the station. "I think I can find the man\r\nMr. Playmore wants to help him, if he decides to go on. Have you any\r\nmessage to send, Valeria?"\r\n\r\n"No. I have done with it, Benjamin; I have nothing more to say."\r\n\r\n"Shall I write and tell you how it ends, if Mr. Playmore does really try\r\nthe experiment at Gleninch?"\r\n\r\nI answered, as I felt, a little bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said "Write and tell me if the experiment fail."\r\n\r\nMy old friend smiled. He knew me better than I knew myself.\r\n\r\n"All right!" he said, resignedly. "I have got the address of your\r\nbanker\'s correspondent in Paris. You will have to go there for money, my\r\ndear; and you _may_ find a letter waiting for you in the office when you\r\nleast expect it. Let me hear how your husband goes on. Good-by--and God\r\nbless you!"\r\n\r\nThat evening I was restored to Eustace.\r\n\r\nHe was too weak, poor fellow, even to raise his head from the pillow.\r\nI knelt down at the bedside and kissed him. His languid, weary eyes\r\nkindled with a new life as my lips touched his. "I must try to live\r\nnow," he whispered, "for your sake."\r\n\r\nMy mother-in-law had delicately left us together. When he said those\r\nwords the temptation to tell him of the new hope that had come to\r\nbrighten our lives was more than I could resist.\r\n\r\n"You must try to live now, Eustace," I said, "for some one else besides\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHis eyes looked wonderingly into mine.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean my mother?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI laid my head on his bosom, and whispered back--"I mean your child."\r\n\r\nI had all my reward for all that I had given up. I forgot Mr. Playmore;\r\nI forgot Gleninch. Our new honeymoon dates, in my remembrance, from that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe quiet time passed, in the by-street in which we lived. The outer\r\nstir and tumult of Parisian life ran its daily course around us,\r\nunnoticed and unheard. Steadily, though slowly, Eustace gained strength.\r\nThe doctors, with a word or two of caution, left him almost entirely to\r\nme. "You are his physician," they said; "the happier you make him, the\r\nsooner he will recover." The quiet, monotonous round of my new life\r\nwas far from wearying me. I, too, wanted repose--I had no interests, no\r\npleasures, out of my husband\'s room.\r\n\r\nOnce, and once only, the placid surface of our lives was just gently\r\nruffled by an allusion to the past. Something that I accidentally said\r\nreminded Eustace of our last interview at Major Fitz-David\'s house.\r\nHe referred, very delicately, to what I had then said of the Verdict\r\npronounced on him at the Trial; and he left me to infer that a word from\r\nmy lips, confirming what his mother had already told him, would quiet\r\nhis mind at once and forever.\r\n\r\nMy answer involved no embarrassments or difficulties; I could and did\r\nhonestly tell him that I had made his wishes my law. But it was hardly\r\nin womanhood, I am afraid, to be satisfied with merely replying, and to\r\nleave it there. I thought it due to me that Eustace too should concede\r\nsomething, in the way of an assurance which might quiet _my_ mind. As\r\nusual with me, the words followed the impulse to speak them. "Eustace,"\r\nI asked, "are you quite cured of those cruel doubts which once made you\r\nleave me?"\r\n\r\nHis answer (as he afterward said) made me blush with pleasure. "Ah,\r\nValeria, I should never have gone away if I had known you then as well\r\nas I know you now!"\r\n\r\nSo the last shadows of distrust melted away out of our lives.\r\n\r\nThe very remembrance of the turmoil and the trouble of my past days in\r\nLondon seemed now to fade from my memory. We were lovers again; we were\r\nabsorbed again in each other; we could almost fancy that our marriage\r\ndated back once more to a day or two since. But one last victory over\r\nmyself was wanting to make my happiness complete. I still felt secret\r\nlongings, in those dangerous moments when I was left by myself, to know\r\nwhether the search for the torn letter had or had not taken place. What\r\nwayward creatures we are! With everything that a woman could want to\r\nmake her happy, I was ready to put that happiness in peril rather than\r\nremain ignorant of what was going on at Gleninch! I actually hailed\r\nthe day when my empty purse gave me an excuse for going to my banker\'s\r\ncorrespondent on business, and so receiving any letters waiting for me\r\nwhich might be placed in my hands.\r\n\r\nI applied for my money without knowing what I was about; wondering all\r\nthe time whether Benjamin had written to me or not. My eyes wandered\r\nover the desks and tables in the office, looking for letters furtively.\r\nNothing of the sort was visible. But a man appeared from an inner\r\noffice: an ugly man, who was yet beautiful to my eyes, for this\r\nsufficient reason--he had a letter in his hand, and he said, "Is this\r\nfor you, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nA glance at the address showed me Benjamin\'s handwriting.\r\n\r\nHad they tried the experiment of recovering the letter? and had they\r\nfailed?\r\n\r\nSomebody put my money in my bag, and politely led me out to the little\r\nhired carriage which was waiting for me at the door. I remember nothing\r\ndistinctly until I open ed the letter on my way home. The first words\r\ntold me that the dust-heap had been examined, and that the fragments of\r\nthe torn letter had been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV. THE DUST-HEAP DISTURBED.\r\n\r\nMy head turned giddy. I was obliged to wait and let my overpowering\r\nagitation subside, before I could read any more.\r\n\r\nLooking at the letter again, after an interval, my eyes fell\r\naccidentally on a sentence near the end, which surprised and startled\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI stopped the driver of the carriage, at the entrance to the street\r\nin which our lodgings were situated, and told him to take me to the\r\nbeautiful park of Paris--the famous Bois de Boulogne. My object was to\r\ngain time enough, in this way, to read the letter carefully through\r\nby myself, and to ascertain whether I ought or ought not to keep the\r\nreceipt of it a secret before I confronted my husband and his mother at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThis precaution taken, I read the narrative which my good Benjamin\r\nhad so wisely and so thoughtfully written for me. Treating the various\r\nincidents methodically, he began with the Report which had arrived, in\r\ndue course of mail, from our agent in America.\r\n\r\nOur man had successfully traced the lodgekeeper\'s daughter and her\r\nhusband to a small town in one of the Western States. Mr. Playmore\'s\r\nletter of introduction at once secured him a cordial reception from the\r\nmarried pair, and a patient hearing when he stated the object of his\r\nvoyage across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nHis first questions led to no very encouraging results. The woman was\r\nconfused and surprised, and was apparently quite unable to exert her\r\nmemory to any useful purpose. Fortunately, her husband proved to be a\r\nvery intelligent man. He took the agent privately aside, and said to\r\nhim, "I understand my wife, and you don\'t. Tell me exactly what it is\r\nyou want to know, and leave it to me to discover how much she remembers\r\nand how much she forgets."\r\n\r\nThis sensible suggestion was readily accepted. The agent waited for\r\nevents a day and a night.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the husband said to him, "Talk to my wife now,\r\nand you\'ll find she has something to tell you. Only mind this. Don\'t\r\nlaugh at her when she speaks of trifles. She is half ashamed to speak of\r\ntrifles, even to me. Thinks men are above such matters, you know. Listen\r\nquietly, and let her talk--and you will get at it all in that way."\r\n\r\nThe agent followed his instructions, and "got at it" as follows:\r\n\r\nThe woman remembered, perfectly well, being sent to clean the bedrooms\r\nand put them tidy, after the gentlefolks had all left Gleninch. Her\r\nmother had a bad hip at the time, and could not go with her and help\r\nher. She did not much fancy being alone in the great house, after\r\nwhat had happened in it. On her way to her work she passed two of\r\nthe cottagers\' children in the neighborhood at play in the park. Mr.\r\nMacallan was always kind to his poor tenants, and never objected to the\r\nyoung ones round about having a run on the grass. The two children idly\r\nfollowed her to the house. She took them inside, along with her--not\r\nliking the place, as already mentioned, and feeling that they would be\r\ncompany in the solitary rooms.\r\n\r\nShe began her work in the Guests\' Corridor--leaving the room in the\r\nother corridor, in which the death had happened, to the last.\r\n\r\nThere was very little to do in the two first rooms. There was not litter\r\nenough, when she had swept the floors and cleaned the grates, to\r\neven half fill the housemaid\'s bucket which she carried with her. The\r\nchildren followed her about; and, all things considered, were "very good\r\ncompany" in the lonely place.\r\n\r\nThe third room (that is to say, the bedchamber which had been occupied\r\nby Miserrimus Dexter) was in a much worse state than the other two, and\r\nwanted a great deal of tidying. She did not much notice the children\r\nhere, being occupied with her work. The litter was swept up from the\r\ncarpet, and the cinders and ashes were taken out of the grate, and the\r\nwhole of it was in the bucket, when her attention was recalled to the\r\nchildren by hearing one of them cry.\r\n\r\nShe looked about the room without at first discovering them.\r\n\r\nA fresh outburst of crying led her in the right direction, and showed\r\nher the children under a table in a corner of the room. The youngest of\r\nthe two had got into a waste-paper basket. The eldest had found an old\r\nbottle of gum, with a brush fixed in the cork, and was gravely painting\r\nthe face of the smaller child with what little remained of the contents\r\nof the bottle. Some natural struggles, on the part of the little\r\ncreature, had ended in the overthrow of the basket, and the usual\r\noutburst of crying had followed as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things the remedy was soon applied. The woman took the\r\nbottle away from the eldest child, and gave it a "box on the ear."\r\nThe younger one she set on its legs again, and she put the two "in the\r\ncorner" to keep them quiet. This done, she swept up such fragments of\r\nthe torn paper in the basket as had fallen on the floor; threw them back\r\nagain into the basket, along with the gum-bottle; fetched the bucket,\r\nand emptied the basket into it; and then proceeded to the fourth and\r\nlast room in the corridor, where she finished her work for that day.\r\n\r\nLeaving the house, with the children after her, she took the filled\r\nbucket to the dust-heap, and emptied it in a hollow place among the\r\nrubbish, about half-way up the mound. Then she took the children home;\r\nand there was an end of it for the day.\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of the appeal made to the woman\'s memory of domestic\r\nevents at Gleninch.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion at which Mr. Playmore arrived, from the facts submitted\r\nto him, was that the chances were now decidedly in favor of the recovery\r\nof the letter. Thrown in, nearly midway between the contents of the\r\nhousemaid\'s bucket, the torn morsels would be protected above as well as\r\nbelow, when they were emptied on the dust-heap.\r\n\r\nSucceeding weeks and months would add to that protection, by adding to\r\nthe accumulated refuse. In the neglected condition of the grounds,\r\nthe dust-heap had not been disturbed in search of manure. There it had\r\nstood, untouched, from the time when the family left Gleninch to\r\nthe present day. And there, hidden deep somewhere in the mound, the\r\nfragments of the letter must be.\r\n\r\nSuch were the lawyer\'s conclusions. He had written immediately to\r\ncommunicate them to Benjamin. And, thereupon, what had Benjamin done?\r\n\r\nAfter having tried his powers of reconstruction on his own\r\ncorrespondence, the prospect of experimenting on the mysterious letter\r\nitself had proved to be a temptation too powerful for the old man to\r\nresist. "I almost fancy, my dear, this business of yours has bewitched\r\nme," he wrote. "You see I have the misfortune to be an idle man. I have\r\ntime to spare and money to spare. And the end of it is that I am here\r\nat Gleninch, engaged on my own sole responsibility (with good Mr.\r\nPlaymore\'s permission) in searching the dust-heap!"\r\n\r\nBenjamin\'s description of his first view of the field of action at\r\nGleninch followed these characteristic lines of apology.\r\n\r\nI passed over the description without ceremony. My remembrance of the\r\nscene was too vivid to require any prompting of that sort. I saw again,\r\nin the dim evening light, the unsightly mound which had so strangely\r\nattracted my attention at Gleninch. I heard again the words in which\r\nMr. Playmore had explained to me the custom of the dust-heap in Scotch\r\ncountry-houses. What had Benjamin and Mr. Playmore done? What had\r\nBenjamin and Mr. Playmore found? For me, the true interest of the\r\nnarrative was there--and to that portion of it I eagerly turned next.\r\n\r\nThey had proceeded methodically, of course, with one eye on the pounds,\r\nshillings, and pence, and the other on the object in view. In Benjamin,\r\nthe lawyer had found what he had not met with in me--a sympathetic mind,\r\nalive to the value of "an abstract of the expenses," and conscious of\r\nthat most remunerative of human virtues, the virtue of economy.\r\n\r\nAt so much a week, they had engaged men to dig into the mound and to\r\nsift the ashes. At so much a week, they had hired a tent to shelter\r\nthe open dust-heap from wind and weather. At so much a week, they had\r\nengaged the services of a young man (personally known to Benjamin), who\r\nwas employed in a laboratory under a professor of chemistry, and who had\r\ndistinguished himself by his skillful manipulation of paper in a\r\nrecent case of forgery on a well-known London firm. Armed with these\r\npreparations, they had begun the work; Benjamin and the young\r\nchemist living at Gleninch, and taking it in turns to superintend the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThree days of labor with the spade and the sieve produced no results of\r\nthe slightest importance. However, the matter was in the hands of two\r\nquietly determined men. They declined to be discouraged. They went on.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day the first morsels of paper were found.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, they proved to be the fragments of a tradesman\'s\r\nprospectus. Nothing dismayed, Benjamin and the young chemist still\r\npersevered. At the end of the day\'s work more pieces of paper were\r\nturned up. These proved to be covered with written characters.\r\nMr. Playmore (arriving at Gleninch, as usual, every evening on\r\nthe conclusion of his labors in the law) was consulted as to the\r\nhandwriting. After careful examination, he declared that the mutilated\r\nportions of sentences submitted to him had been written, beyond all\r\ndoubt, by Eustace Macallan\'s first wife!\r\n\r\nThis discovery aroused the enthusiasm of the searchers to fever height.\r\n\r\nSpades and sieves were from that moment forbidden utensils. However\r\nunpleasant the task might be, hands alone were used in the further\r\nexamination of the mound. The first and foremost necessity was to place\r\nthe morsels of paper (in flat cardboard boxes prepared for the purpose)\r\nin their order as they were found. Night came; the laborers were\r\ndismissed; Benjamin and his two colleagues worked on by lamplight. The\r\nmorsels of paper were now turned up by dozens, instead of by ones and\r\ntwos. For a while the search prospered in this way; and then the\r\nmorsels appeared no more. Had they all been recovered? or would renewed\r\nhand-digging yield more yet? The next light layers of rubbish were\r\ncarefully removed--and the grand discovery of the day followed. There\r\n(upside down) was the gum-bottle which the lodge-keeper\'s daughter\r\nhad spoken of. And, more precious still, there, under it, were more\r\nfragments of written paper, all stuck together in a little lump, by the\r\nlast drippings from the gum-bottle dropping upon them as they lay on the\r\ndust-heap!\r\n\r\nThe scene now shifted to the interior of the house. When the searchers\r\nnext assembled they met at the great table in the library at Gleninch.\r\n\r\nBenjamin\'s experience with the "Puzzles" which he had put together in\r\nthe days of his boyhood proved to be of some use to his companions.\r\nThe fragments accidentally stuck together would, in all probability,\r\nbe found to fit each other, and would certainly (in any case) be the\r\neasiest fragments to reconstruct as a center to start from.\r\n\r\nThe delicate business of separating these pieces of paper, and of\r\npreserving them in the order in which they had adhered to each\r\nother, was assigned to the practiced fingers of the chemist. But the\r\ndifficulties of his task did not end here. The writing was (as usual\r\nin letters) traced on both sides of the paper, and it could only be\r\npreserved for the purpose of reconstruction by splitting each morsel\r\ninto two--so as artificially to make a blank side, on which could\r\nbe spread the fine cement used for reuniting the fragments in their\r\noriginal form.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Playmore and Benjamin the prospect of successfully putting\r\nthe letter together, under these disadvantages, seemed to be almost\r\nhopeless. Their skilled colleague soon satisfied them that they were\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nHe drew their attention to the thickness of the paper--note-paper of the\r\nstrongest and best quality--on which the writing was traced. It was\r\nof more than twice the substance of the last paper on which he had\r\noperated, when he was engaged in the forgery ease; and it was, on that\r\naccount, comparatively easy for him (aided by the mechanical appliances\r\nwhich he had brought from London) to split the morsels of the torn\r\npaper, within a given space of time which might permit them to begin the\r\nreconstruction of the letter that night.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations, he quietly devoted himself to his work. While\r\nBenjamin and the lawyer were still poring over the scattered morsels\r\nof the letter which had been first discovered, and trying to piece\r\nthem together again, the chemist had divided the greater part of the\r\nfragments specially confided to him into two halves each; and had\r\ncorrectly put together some five or six sentences of the letter on the\r\nsmooth sheet of cardboard prepared for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThey looked eagerly at the reconstructed writing so far.\r\n\r\nIt was correctly done: the sense was perfect. The first result gained\r\nby examination was remarkable enough to reward them for all their\r\nexertions. The language used plainly identified the person to whom the\r\nlate Mrs. Eustace had addressed her letter.\r\n\r\nThat person was--my husband.\r\n\r\nAnd the letter thus addressed--if the plainest circumstantial evidence\r\ncould be trusted--was identical with the letter which Miserrimus Dexter\r\nhad suppressed until the Trial was over, and had then destroyed by\r\ntearing it up.\r\n\r\nThese were the discoveries that had been made at the time when Benjamin\r\nwrote to me. He had been on the point of posting his letter, when Mr.\r\nPlaymore had suggested that he should keep it by him for a few days\r\nlonger, on the chance of having more still to tell me.\r\n\r\n"We are indebted to her for these results," the lawyer had said. "But\r\nfor her resolution; and her influence over Miserrimus Dexter, we should\r\nnever have discovered what the dust-heap was hiding from us--we should\r\nnever have seen so much as a glimmering of the truth. She has the first\r\nclaim to the fullest information. Let her have it."\r\n\r\nThe letter had been accordingly kept back for three days. That interval\r\nbeing at an end, it was hurriedly resumed and concluded in terms which\r\nindescribably alarmed me.\r\n\r\n"The chemist is advancing rapidly with his part of the work" (Benjamin\r\nwrote); "and I have succeeded in putting together a separate portion\r\nof the torn writing which makes sense. Comparison of what he has\r\naccomplished with what I have accomplished has led to startling\r\nconclusions. Unless Mr. Playmore and I are entirely wrong (and God\r\ngrant we may be so!), there is a serious necessity for your keeping the\r\nreconstruction of the letter strictly secret from everybody about you.\r\nThe disclosures suggested by what has come to light are so heartrending\r\nand so dreadful that I cannot bring myself to write about them until\r\nI am absolutely obliged to do so. Please forgive me for disturbing you\r\nwith this news. We are bound, sooner or later, to consult with you in\r\nthe matter; and we think it right to prepare your mind for what may be\r\nto come."\r\n\r\nTo this there was added a postscript in Mr. Playmore\'s handwriting:\r\n\r\n"Pray observe strictly the caution which Mr. Benjamin impresses on\r\nyou. And bear this in mind, as a warning from _me:_ If we succeed in\r\nreconstructing the entire letter, the last person living who ought (in\r\nmy opinion) to be allowed to see it is--your husband."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI. THE CRISIS DEFERRED.\r\n\r\n"TAKE care, Valeria!" said Mrs. Macallan. "I ask you no questions; I\r\nonly caution you for your own sake. Eustace has noticed what I have\r\nnoticed--Eustace has seen a change in you. Take care!"\r\n\r\nSo my mother-in-law spoke to me later in the day, when we happened to be\r\nalone. I had done my best to conceal all traces of the effect produced\r\non me by the strange and terrible news from Gleninch. But who could read\r\nwhat I had read, who could feel what I now felt, and still maintain\r\nan undisturbed serenity of look and manner? If I had been the vilest\r\nhypocrite living, I doubt even then if my face could have kept my secret\r\nwhile my mind was full of Benjamin\'s letter.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken her word of caution, Mrs. Macallan made no further advance\r\nto me. I dare say she was right. Still, it seemed hard to be left,\r\nwithout a word of advice or of sympathy, to decide for myself what it\r\nwas my duty to my husband to do next.\r\n\r\nTo show him Benjamin\'s narrative, in his state of health, and in the\r\nface of the warning addressed to me, was simply out of the question. At\r\nthe same time, it was equally impossible, after I had already betrayed\r\nmyself, to keep him entirely in the dark. I thought over it anxiously\r\nin the night. When the morning came, I decided to appeal to my husband\'s\r\nconfidence in me.\r\n\r\nI went straight to the point in these terms:\r\n\r\n"Eustace, your mother said yesterday that you noticed a change in me\r\nwhen I came back from my drive. Is she right?"\r\n\r\n"Quite right, Valeria," he answered--speaking in lower tones than usual,\r\nand not looking at me.\r\n\r\n"We have no concealments from each other now," I answered. "I ought to\r\ntell you, and do tell you, that I found a letter from England waiting\r\nat the banker\'s which has caused me some agitation and alarm. Will you\r\nleave it to me to choose my own time for speaking more plainly? And will\r\nyou believe, love, that I am really doing my duty toward you, as a good\r\nwife, in making this request?"\r\n\r\nI paused. He made no answer: I could see that he was secretly struggling\r\nwith himself. Had I ventured too far? Had I overestimated the strength\r\nof my influence? My heart beat fast, my voice faltered--but I summoned\r\ncourage enough to take his hand, and to make a last appeal to him.\r\n"Eustace," I said; "don\'t you know me yet well enough to trust me?"\r\n\r\nHe turned toward me for the first time. I saw a last vanishing trace of\r\ndoubt in his eyes as they looked into mine.\r\n\r\n"You promise, sooner or later, to tell me the whole truth?" he said\r\n\r\n"I promise with all my heart!"\r\n\r\n"I trust you, Valeria!"\r\n\r\nHis brightening eyes told me that he really meant what he said.\r\nWe sealed our compact with a kiss. Pardon me for mentioning these\r\ntrifles--I am still writing (if you will kindly remember it) of our new\r\nhoneymoon.\r\n\r\nBy that day\'s post I answered Benjamin\'s letter, telling him what I had\r\ndone, and entreating him, if he and Mr. Playmore approved of my conduct,\r\nto keep me informed of any future discoveries which they might make at\r\nGleninch.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval---an endless interval, as it seemed to me--of ten\r\ndays more, I received a second letter from my old friend, with another\r\npostscript added by Mr. Playmore.\r\n\r\n"We are advancing steadily and successfully with the putting together of\r\nthe letter," Benjamin wrote. "The one new discovery which we have made\r\nis of serious importance to your husband. We have reconstructed certain\r\nsentences declaring, in the plainest words, that the arsenic which\r\nEustace procured was purchased at the request of his wife, and was in\r\nher possession at Gleninch. This, remember, is in the handwriting of\r\nthe wife, and is signed by the wife--as we have also found out.\r\nUnfortunately, I am obliged to add that the objection to taking your\r\nhusband into our confidence, mentioned when I last wrote, still remains\r\nin force--in greater force, I may say, than ever. The more we make out\r\nof the letter, the more inclined we are (if we only studied our own\r\nfeelings) to throw it back into the dust-heap, in mercy to the memory of\r\nthe unhappy writer. I shall keep this open for a day or two. If there\r\nis more news to tell you by that time you will hear of it from Mr.\r\nPlaymore."\r\n\r\nMr. Playmore\'s postscript followed, dated three days later.\r\n\r\n"The concluding part of the late Mrs. Macallan\'s letter to her husband,"\r\nthe lawyer wrote, "has proved accidentally to be the first part which\r\nwe have succeeded in piecing together. With the exception of a few gaps\r\nstill left, here and there, the writing of the closing paragraphs\r\nhas been perfectly reconstructed. I have neither the time nor the\r\ninclination to write to you on this sad subject in any detail. In a\r\nfortnight more, at the longest, we shall, I hope, send you a copy of the\r\nletter, complete from the first line to the last. Meanwhile, it is\r\nmy duty to tell you that there is one bright side to this otherwise\r\ndeplorable and shocking document. Legally speaking, as well as morally\r\nspeaking, it absolutely vindicates your husband\'s innocence. And it\r\nmay be lawfully used for this purpose--if he can reconcile it to his\r\nconscience, and to the mercy due to the memory of the dead, to permit\r\nthe public exposure of the letter in Court. Understand me, he cannot be\r\ntried again on what we call the criminal charge--for certain technical\r\nreasons with which I need not trouble you. But, if the facts which were\r\ninvolved at the criminal trial can also be shown to be involved in a\r\ncivil action (and in this case they can), the entire matter may be made\r\nthe subject of a new legal inquiry; and the verdict of a second jury,\r\ncompletely vindicating your husband, may thus be obtained. Keep this\r\ninformation to yourself for the present. Preserve the position which you\r\nhave so sensibly adopted toward Eustace until you have read the restored\r\nletter. When you have done this, my own idea is that you will shrink,\r\nin pity to _him,_ from letting him see it. How he is to be kept in\r\nignorance of what we have discovered is another question, the discussion\r\nof which must be deferred until we can consult together. Until that time\r\ncomes, I can only repeat my advice--wait till the next news reaches you\r\nfrom Gleninch."\r\n\r\nI waited. What I suffered, what Eustace thought of me, does not matter.\r\nNothing matters now but the facts.\r\n\r\nIn less than a fortnight more the task of restoring the letter was\r\ncompleted. Excepting certain instances, in which the morsels of the torn\r\npaper had been irretrievably lost--and in which it had been necessary\r\nto complete the sense in harmony with the writer\'s intention--the whole\r\nletter had been put together; and the promised copy of it was forwarded\r\nto me in Paris.\r\n\r\nBefore you, too, read that dreadful letter, do me one favor. Let me\r\nbriefly remind you of the circumstances under which Eustace Macallan\r\nmarried his first wife.\r\n\r\nRemember that the poor creature fell in love with him without awakening\r\nany corresponding affection on his side. Remember that he separated\r\nhimself from her, and did all he could to avoid her, when he found this\r\nout. Remember that she presented herself at his residence in London\r\nwithout a word of warning; that he did his best to save her reputation;\r\nthat he failed, through no fault of his own; and that he ended, rashly\r\nended in a moment of despair, by marrying her, to silence the scandal\r\nthat must otherwise have blighted her life as a woman for the rest\r\nof her days. Bear all this in mind (it is the sworn testimony of\r\nrespectable witnesses); and pray do not forget--however foolishly\r\nand blamably he may have written about her in the secret pages of his\r\nDiary--that he was proved to have done his best to conceal from his wife\r\nthe aversion which the poor soul inspired in him; and that he was (in\r\nthe opinion of those who could best judge him) at least a courteous and\r\na considerate husband, if he could be no more.\r\n\r\nAnd now take the letter. It asks but one favor of you: it asks to be\r\nread by the light of Christ\'s teaching--"Judge not, that ye be not\r\njudged."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII. THE WIFE\'S CONFESSION.\r\n\r\n"GLENINCH, October 19, 18--.\r\n\r\n"MY HUSBAND--\r\n\r\n"I have something very painful to tell you about one of your oldest\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n"You have never encouraged me to come to you with any confidences of\r\nmine. If you had allowed me to be as familiar with you as some wives are\r\nwith their husbands, I should have spoken to you personally instead of\r\nwriting. As it is, I don\'t know how you might receive what I have to say\r\nto you if I said it by word of mouth. So I write.\r\n\r\n"The man against whom I warn you is still a guest in this\r\nhouse--Miserrimus Dexter. No falser or wickeder creature walks the\r\nearth. Don\'t throw my letter aside! I have waited to say this until I\r\ncould find proof that might satisfy you. I have got the proof.\r\n\r\n"You may remember that I ventured to express some disapproval when you\r\nfirst told me you had asked this man to visit us. If you had allowed me\r\ntime to explain myself, I might have been bold enough to give you a good\r\nreason for the aversion I felt toward your friend. But you would not\r\nwait. You hastily (and most unjustly) accused me of feeling prejudiced\r\nagainst the miserable creature on account of his deformity. No other\r\nfeeling than compassion for deformed persons has ever entered my mind.\r\nI have, indeed, almost a fellow-feeling for them; being that next worst\r\nthing myself to a deformity--a plain woman. I objected to Mr. Dexter\r\nas your guest because he had asked me to be his wife in past days,\r\nand because I had reason to fear that he still regarded me (after my\r\nmarriage) with a guilty and a horrible love. Was it not my duty, as a\r\ngood wife, to object to his being your guest at Gleninch? And was it not\r\nyour duty, as a good husband, to encourage me to say more?\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Dexter has been your guest for many weeks; and Mr. Dexter has\r\ndared to speak to me again of his love. He has insulted me, and insulted\r\nyou, by declaring that _he_ adores me and that _you_ hate me. He has\r\npromised me a life of unalloyed happiness, in a foreign country with my\r\nlover; and he has prophesied for me a life of unendurable misery at home\r\nwith my husband.\r\n\r\n"Why did I not make my complaint to you, and have this monster dismissed\r\nfrom the house at once and forever?\r\n\r\n"Are you sure you would have believed me if I had complained, and if\r\nyour bosom friend had denied all intention of insulting me? I heard you\r\nonce say (when you were not aware that I was within hearing) that the\r\nvainest women were always the ugly women. You might have accused _me_ of\r\nvanity. Who knows?\r\n\r\n"But I have no desire to shelter myself under this excuse. I am a\r\njealous, unhappy creature; always doubtful of your affection for me;\r\nalways fearing that another woman has got my place in your heart.\r\nMiserrimus Dexter has practiced on this weakness of mine. He has\r\ndeclared he can prove to me (if I will permit him) that I am, in\r\nyour secret heart, an object of loathing to you; that you shrink from\r\ntouching me; that you curse the hour when you were foolish enough to\r\nmake me your wife. I have struggled as long as I could against the\r\ntemptation to let him produce his proofs. It was a terrible temptation\r\nto a woman who was far from feeling sure of the sincerity of your\r\naffection for her; and it has ended in getting the better of my\r\nresistance. I wickedly concealed the disgust which the wretch inspired\r\nin me; I wickedly gave him leave to explain himself; I wickedly\r\npermitted this enemy of yours and of mine to take me into his\r\nconfidence. And why? Because I loved you, and you only; and because\r\nMiserrimus Dexter\'s proposal did, after all, echo a doubt of you that\r\nhad long been gnawing secretly at my heart.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, Eustace! This is my first sin against you. It shall be my\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"I will not spare myself; I will write a full confession of what I said\r\nto him and of what he said to me. You may make me suffer for it when you\r\nknow what I have done; but you will at least be warned in time; you will\r\nsee your false friend in his true light.\r\n\r\n"I said to him, \'How can you prove to me that my husband hates me in\r\nsecret?\'\r\n\r\n"He answered, \'I can prove it under his own handwriting; you shall see\r\nit in his Diary.\'\r\n\r\n"I said, \'His Diary has a lock; and the drawer in which he keeps it has\r\na lock. How can you get at the Diary and the drawer?\'\r\n\r\n"He answered, \'I have my own way of getting at both of them, without the\r\nslightest risk of being discovered by your husband. All you have to do\r\nis to give me the opportunity of seeing you privately. I will engage, in\r\nreturn, to bring the open Diary with me to your room.\'\r\n\r\n"I said, \'How can I give you the opportunity? What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n"He pointed to the key in the door of communication between my room and\r\nthe little study.\r\n\r\n"He said, \'With my infirmity, I may not be able to profit by the first\r\nopportunity of visiting you here unobserved. I must be able to choose\r\nmy own time and my own way of getting to you secretly. Let me take this\r\nkey, leaving the door locked. When the key is missed, if _you_ say it\r\ndoesn\'t matter--if _you_ point out that the door is locked, and tell the\r\nservants not to trouble themselves about finding the key--there will be\r\nno disturbance in the house; and I shall be in secure possession of a\r\nmeans of communication with you which no one will suspect. Will you do\r\nthis?\'\r\n\r\n"I have done it.\r\n\r\n"Yes! I have become the accomplice of this double-faced villain. I have\r\ndegraded myself and outraged you by making an appointment to pry into\r\nyour Diary. I know how base my conduct is. I can make no excuse. I can\r\nonly repeat that I love you, and that I am sorely afraid you don\'t love\r\nme. And Miserrimus Dexter offers to end my doubts by showing me the most\r\nsecret thoughts of your heart, in your own writing.\r\n\r\n"He is to be with me, for this purpose (while you are out), some time\r\nin the course of the next two hours I shall decline to be satisfied with\r\nonly once looking at your Diary; and I shall make an appointment with\r\nhim to bring it to me again at the same time to-morrow. Before then you\r\nwill receive these lines by the hand of my nurse. Go out as usual after\r\nreading them; but return privately, and unlock the table-drawer in which\r\nyou keep your book. You will find it gone. Post yourself quietly in the\r\nlittle study; and you will discover the Diary (when Miserrimus Dexter\r\nleaves me) in the hands of your friend."*\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n* Note by Mr. Playmore:\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulties of reconstruction occurred in this first\r\nportion of the torn letter. In the fourth paragraph from the beginning\r\nwe have been obliged to supply lost words in no less than three places.\r\nIn the ninth, tenth, and seventeenth paragraphs the same proceeding was,\r\nin a greater or less degree, found to be necessary. In all these cases\r\nthe utmost pains have been taken to supply the deficiency in exact\r\naccordance with what appeared to be the meaning of the writer, as\r\nindicated in the existing pieces of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n"October 20.\r\n\r\n"I have read your Diary.\r\n\r\n"At last I know what you really think of me. I have read what Miserrimus\r\nDexter promised I should read--the confession of your loathing for me,\r\nin your own handwriting.\r\n\r\n"You will not receive what I wrote to you yesterday at the time or in\r\nthe manner which I had proposed. Long as my letter is, I have still\r\n(after reading your Diary) some more words to add. After I have closed\r\nand sealed the envelope, and addressed it to you, I shall put it under\r\nmy pillow. It will be found there when I am laid out for the grave--and\r\nthen, Eustace (when it is too late for hope or help), my letter will be\r\ngiven to you.\r\n\r\n"Yes: I have had enough of my life. Yes: I mean to die.\r\n\r\n"I have already sacrificed everything but my life to my love for you.\r\nNow I know that my love is not returned, the last sacrifice left is\r\neasy. My death will set you free to marry Mrs. Beauly.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what it cost me to control my hatred of her, and to beg\r\nher to pay her visit here, without minding my illness. I could never\r\nhave done it if I had not been so fond of you, and so fearful of\r\nirritating you against me by showing my jealousy. And how did you reward\r\nme? Let your Diary answer: \'I tenderly embraced her this very morning;\r\nand I hope, poor soul, she did not discover the effort that it cost me.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, I have discovered it now. I know that you privately think your\r\nlife with me \'a purgatory.\' I know that you have compassionately hidden\r\nfrom me the \'sense of shrinking that comes over you when you are obliged\r\nto submit to my caresses.\' I am nothing but an obstacle--an \'utterly\r\ndistasteful\' obstacle--between you and the woman whom you love so dearly\r\nthat you \'adore the earth which she touches with her foot.\' Be it so! I\r\nwill stand in your way no longer. It is no sacrifice and no merit on\r\nmy part. Life is unendurable to me, now I know that the man whom I love\r\nwith all my heart and soul secretly shrinks from me whenever I touch\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I have got the means of death close at hand.\r\n\r\n"The arsenic that I twice asked you to buy for me is in my\r\ndressing-case. I deceived you when I mentioned some commonplace domestic\r\nreasons for wanting it. My true reason was to try if I could not improve\r\nmy ugly complexion--not from any vain feeling of mine: only to make\r\nmyself look better and more lovable in your eyes. I have taken some of\r\nit for that purpose; but I have got plenty left to kill myself with.\r\nThe poison will have its use at last. It might have failed to improve my\r\ncomplexion--it will not fail to relieve you of your ugly wife.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let me be examined after death. Show this letter to the doctor\r\nwho attends me. It will tell him that I have committed suicide; it will\r\nprevent any innocent persons from being suspected of poisoning me.\r\nI want nobody to be blamed or punished. I shall remove the chemist\'s\r\nlabel, and carefully empty the bottle containing the poison, so that he\r\nmay not suffer on my account.\r\n\r\n"I must wait here, and rest a little while--then take up my letter\r\nagain. It is far too long already. But these are my farewell words. I\r\nmay surely dwell a little on my last talk with you!\r\n\r\n"October 21. Two o\'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n"I sent you out of the room yesterday when you came in to ask how I had\r\npassed the night. And I spoke of you shamefully, Eustace, after you\r\nhad gone, to the hired nurse who attends on me. Forgive me. I am almost\r\nbeside myself now. You know why.\r\n\r\n"Half-past three.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my husband, I have done the deed which will relieve you of the wife\r\nwhom you hate! I have taken the poison--all of it that was left in the\r\npaper packet, which was the first that I found. If this is not enough to\r\nkill me, I have more left in the bottle.\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes past five.\r\n\r\n"You have just gone, after giving me my composing draught. My courage\r\nfailed me at the sight of you. I thought to myself, \'If he look at me\r\nkindly, I will confess what I have done, and let him save my life.\' You\r\nnever looked at me at all. You only looked at the medicine. I let you go\r\nwithout saying a word.\r\n\r\n"Half-past five.\r\n\r\n"I begin to feel the first effects of the poison. The nurse is asleep\r\nat the foot of my bed. I won\'t call for assistance; I won\'t wake her. I\r\nwill die.\r\n\r\n"Half-past nine.\r\n\r\n"The agony was beyond my endurance--I awoke the nurse. I have seen the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"Nobody suspects anything. Strange to say, the pain has left me; I have\r\nevidently taken too little of the poison. I must open the bottle which\r\ncontains the larger quantity. Fortunately, you are not near me--my\r\nresolution to die, or, rather, my loathing of life, remains as bitterly\r\nunaltered as ever. To make sure of my courage, I have forbidden the\r\nnurse to send for you. She has just gone downstairs by my orders. I am\r\nfree to get the poison out of my dressing-case.\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes to ten.\r\n\r\n"I had just time to hide the bottle (after the nurse had left me) when\r\nyou came into my room.\r\n\r\n"I had another moment of weakness when I saw you. I determined to give\r\nmyself a last chance of life. That is to say, I determined to offer you\r\na last opportunity of treating me kindly. I asked you to get me a cup of\r\ntea. If, in paying me this little attention, you only encouraged me by\r\none fond word or one fond look, I resolved not to take the second dose\r\nof poison.\r\n\r\n"You obeyed my wishes, but you were not kind. You gave me my tea,\r\nEustace, as if you were giving a drink to your dog. And then you\r\nwondered in a languid way (thinking, I suppose, of Mrs. Beauly all the\r\ntime), at my dropping the cup in handing it back to you. I really could\r\nnot help it; my hand _would_ tremble. In my place, your hand might have\r\ntrembled too--with the arsenic under the bedclothes. You politely hoped,\r\nbefore you went away? that the tea would do me good--and, oh God, you\r\ncould not even look at me when you said that! You looked at the broken\r\nbits of the tea-cup.\r\n\r\n"The instant you were out of the room I took the poison--a double dose\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n"I have a little request to make here, while I think of it.\r\n\r\n"After removing the label from the bottle, and putting it back, clean,\r\nin my dressing-case, it struck me that I had failed to take the same\r\nprecaution (in the early morning) with the empty paper-packet, bearing\r\non it the name of the other chemist. I threw it aside on the counterpane\r\nof the bed, among some other loose papers. My ill-tempered nurse\r\ncomplained of the litter, and crumpled them all up and put them away\r\nsomewhere. I hope the chemist will not suffer through my carelessness.\r\nPray bear it in mind to say that he is not to blame.\r\n\r\n"Dexter--something reminds me of Miserrimus Dexter. He has put your\r\nDiary back again in the drawer, and he presses me for an answer to his\r\nproposals. Has this false wretch any conscience? If he has, even he will\r\nsuffer--when my death answers him.\r\n\r\n"The nurse has been in my room again. I have sent her away. I have told\r\nher I want to be alone.\r\n\r\n"How is the time going? I cannot find my watch. Is the pain coming back\r\nagain and paralyzing me? I don\'t feel it keenly yet.\r\n\r\n"It may come back, though, at any moment. I have still to close my\r\nletter and to address it to you. And, besides, I must save up my\r\nstrength to hide it under the pillow, so that nobody may find it until\r\nafter my death.\r\n\r\n"Farewell, my dear. I wish I had been a prettier woman. A more loving\r\nwoman (toward you) I could not be. Even now I dread the sight of your\r\ndear face. Even now, if I allowed myself the luxury of looking at you,\r\nI don\'t know that you might not charm me into confessing what I have\r\ndone--before it is too late to save me.\r\n\r\n"But you are not here. Better as it is! better as it is!\r\n\r\n"Once more, farewell! Be happier than you have been with me. I love you,\r\nEustace--I forgive you. When you have nothing else to think about, think\r\nsometimes, as kindly as you can, of your poor, ugly\r\n\r\n"SARA MACALLAN."*\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n* Note by Mr. Playmore:\r\n\r\nThe lost words and phrases supplied in this concluding portion of the\r\nletter are so few in number that it is needless to mention them. The\r\nfragments which were found accidentally stuck together by the gum, and\r\nwhich represent the part of the letter first completely reconstructed,\r\nbegin at the phrase, "I spoke of you shamefully, Eustace;" and end with\r\nthe broken sentence, "If in paying me this little attention, you only\r\nencouraged me by one fond word or one fond look, I resolved not to\r\ntake--" With the assistance thus afforded to us, the labor of putting\r\ntogether the concluding half of the letter (dated "October 20") was\r\ntrifling, compared with the almost insurmountable difficulties which we\r\nencountered in dealing with the scattered wreck of the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII. WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could dry my eyes and compose my spirits after reading\r\nthe wife\'s pitiable and dreadful farewell, my first thought was of\r\nEustace--my first anxiety was to prevent him from ever reading what I\r\nhad read.\r\n\r\nYes! to this end it had come. I had devoted my life to the attainment of\r\none object; and that object I had gained. There, on the table before me,\r\nlay the triumphant vindication of my husband\'s innocence; and, in mercy\r\nto him, in mercy to the memory of his dead wife, my one hope was that he\r\nmight never see it! my one desire was to hide it from the public view!\r\n\r\nI looked back at the strange circumstances under which the letter had\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\nIt was all my doing--as the lawyer had said. And yet, what I had done, I\r\nhad, so to speak, done blindfold. The merest accident might have altered\r\nthe whole course of later events. I had over and over again interfered\r\nto check Ariel when she entreated the Master to "tell her a story." If\r\nshe had not succeeded, in spite of my opposition, Miserrimus Dexter\'s\r\nlast effort of memory might never have been directed to the tragedy at\r\nGleninch. And, again, if I had only remembered to move my chair, and so\r\nto give Benjamin the signal to leave off, he would never have written\r\ndown the apparently senseless words which have led us to the discovery\r\nof the truth.\r\n\r\nLooking back at events in this frame of mind, the very sight of the\r\nletter sickened and horrified me. I cursed the day which had disinterred\r\nthe fragments of it from their foul tomb. Just at the time when Eustace\r\nhad found his weary way back to health and strength; just at the time\r\nwhen we were united again and happy again--when a month or two more\r\nmight make us father and mother, as well as husband and wife--that\r\nfrightful record of suffering and sin had risen against us like\r\nan avenging spirit. There it faced me on the table, threatening my\r\nhusband\'s tranquillity; nay, for all I knew (if he read it at the\r\npresent critical stage of his recovery) even threatening his life!\r\n\r\nThe hour struck from the clock on the mantelpiece. It was Eustace\'s time\r\nfor paying me his morning visit in my own little room. He might come in\r\nat any moment; he might see the letter; he might snatch the letter out\r\nof my hand. In a frenzy of terror and loathing, I caught up the vile\r\nsheets of paper and threw them into the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate thing that a copy only had been sent to me. If the\r\noriginal letter had been in its place, I believe I should have burned\r\nthe original at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe last morsel of paper had been barely consumed by the flames when the\r\ndoor opened, and Eustace came in.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the fire. The black cinders of the burned paper were still\r\nfloating at the back of the grate. He had seen the letter brought to\r\nme at the breakfast-table. Did he suspect what I had done? He said\r\nnothing--he stood gravely looking into the fire. Then he advanced and\r\nfixed his eyes on me. I suppose I was very pale. The first words he\r\nspoke were words which asked me if I felt ill.\r\n\r\nI was determined not to deceive him, even in the merest trifle.\r\n\r\n"I am feeling a little nervous, Eustace," I answered; "that is all."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me again, as if he expected me to say something more. I\r\nremained silent. He took a letter out of the breast-pocket of his coat\r\nand laid it on the table before me--just where the Confession had lain\r\nbefore I destroyed it!\r\n\r\n"I have had a letter too this morning," he said. "And _I,_ Valeria, have\r\nno secrets from _you._"\r\n\r\nI understood the reproach which my husband\'s last words conveyed; but I\r\nmade no attempt to answer him.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish me to read it?" was all I said pointing to the envelope\r\nwhich he had laid on the table.\r\n\r\n"I have already said that I have no secrets from you," he repeated. "The\r\nenvelope is open. See for yourself what is inclosed in it."\r\n\r\nI took out--not a letter, but a printed paragraph, cut from a Scotch\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\n"Read it," said Eustace.\r\n\r\nI read as follows:\r\n\r\n"STRANGE DOINGS AT GLENINCH--A romance in real life seems to be in\r\ncourse of progress at Mr. Macallan\'s country-house. Private excavations\r\nare taking place--if our readers will pardon us the unsavory\r\nallusion--at the dust-heap, of all places in the world! Something has\r\nassuredly been discovered; but nobody knows what. This alone is certain:\r\nFor weeks past two strangers from London (superintended by our respected\r\nfellow-citizen, Mr. Playmore) have been at work night and day in the\r\nlibrary at Gleninch, with the door locked. Will the secret ever be\r\nrevealed? And will it throw any light on a mysterious and shocking event\r\nwhich our readers have learned to associate with the past history of\r\nGleninch? Perhaps when Mr. Macallan returns, he may be able to answer\r\nthese questions. In the meantime we can only await events."\r\n\r\nI laid the newspaper slip on the table, in no very Christian frame of\r\nmind toward the persons concerned in producing it. Some reporter in\r\nsearch of news had evidently been prying about the grounds at Gleninch,\r\nand some busy-body in the neighborhood had in all probability sent the\r\npublished paragraph to Eustace. Entirely at a loss what to do, I waited\r\nfor my husband to speak. He did not keep me in suspense--he questioned\r\nme instantly.\r\n\r\n"Do you understand what it means, Valeria?"\r\n\r\nI answered honestly--I owned that I understood what it meant.\r\n\r\nHe waited again, as if he expected me to say more. I still kept the only\r\nrefuge left to me--the refuge of silence.\r\n\r\n"Am I to know no more than I know now?" he proceeded, after an interval.\r\n"Are you not bound to tell me what is going on in my own house?"\r\n\r\nIt is a common remark that people, if they can think at all, think\r\nquickly in emergencies. There was but one way out of the embarrassing\r\nposition in which my husband\'s last words had placed me. My instincts\r\nshowed me the way, I suppose. At any rate, I took it.\r\n\r\n"You have promised to trust me," I began.\r\n\r\nHe admitted that he had promised.\r\n\r\n"I must ask you, for your own sake, Eustace, to trust me for a little\r\nwhile longer. I will satisfy you, if you will only give me time."\r\n\r\nHis face darkened. "How much longer must I wait?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI saw that the time had come for trying some stronger form of persuasion\r\nthan words.\r\n\r\n"Kiss me," I said, "before I tell you!"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated (so like a husband!). And I persisted (so like a wife!).\r\nThere was no choice for him but to yield. Having given me my kiss (not\r\nover-graciously), he insisted once more on knowing how much longer I\r\nwanted him to wait.\r\n\r\n"I want you to wait," I answered, "until our child is born."\r\n\r\nHe started. My condition took him by surprise. I gently pressed his\r\nhand, and gave him a look. He returned the look (warmly enough, this\r\ntime, to satisfy me). "Say you consent," I whispered.\r\n\r\nHe consented.\r\n\r\nSo I put off the day of reckoning once more. So I gained time to consult\r\nagain with Benjamin and Mr. Playmore.\r\n\r\nWhile Eustace remained with me in the room, I was composed, and capable\r\nof talking to him. But when he left me, after a time, to think over what\r\nhad passed between us, and to remember how kindly he had given way to\r\nme, my heart turned pityingly to those other wives (better women, some\r\nof them, than I am), whose husbands, under similar circumstances, would\r\nhave spoken hard words to them--would perhaps even have acted more\r\ncruelly still. The contrast thus suggested between their fate and mine\r\nquite overcame me. What had I done to deserve my happiness? What\r\nhad _they_ done, poor souls, to deserve their misery? My nerves were\r\noverwrought, I dare says after reading the dreadful confession of\r\nEustace\'s first wife. I burst out crying--and I was all the better for\r\nit afterward!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX. PAST AND FUTURE.\r\n\r\nI write from memory, unassisted by notes or diaries; and I have\r\nno distinct recollection of the length of our residence abroad. It\r\ncertainly extended over a period of some months. Long after Eustace was\r\nstrong enough to take the journey to London the doctors persisted in\r\nkeeping him in Paris. He had shown symptoms of weakness in one of his\r\nlungs, and his medical advisers, seeing that he prospered in the dry\r\natmosphere of France, warned him to be careful of breathing too soon the\r\nmoist air of his own country.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that we were still in Paris when I received my next\r\nnews from Gleninch.\r\n\r\nThis time no letters passed on either side. To my surprise and delight,\r\nBenjamin quietly made his appearance one morning in our pretty French\r\ndrawing-room. He was so preternaturally smart in his dress, and so\r\nincomprehensibly anxious (while my husband was in the way) to make us\r\nunderstand that his reasons for visiting Paris were holiday reasons\r\nonly, that I at once suspected him of having crossed the Channel in\r\na double character--say, as tourist in search of pleasure, when third\r\npersons were present; as ambassador from Mr. Playmore, when he and I had\r\nthe room to ourselves.\r\n\r\nLater in the day I contrived that we should be left together, and I soon\r\nfound that my anticipations had not misled me. Benjamin had set out for\r\nParis, at Mr. Playmore\'s express request, to consult with me as to the\r\nfuture, and to enlighten me as to the past. He presented me with his\r\ncredentials in the shape of a little note from the lawyer.\r\n\r\n"There are some few points" (Mr. Playmore wrote) "which the recovery\r\nof the letter does not seem to clear up. I have done my best, with Mr.\r\nBenjamin\'s assistance, to find the right explanation of these debatable\r\nmatters; and I have treated the subject, for the sake of brevity, in the\r\nform of Questions and Answers. Will you accept me as interpreter, after\r\nthe mistakes I made when you consulted me in Edinburgh? Events, I admit,\r\nhave proved that I was entirely wrong in trying to prevent you from\r\nreturning to Dexter--and partially wrong in suspecting Dexter of being\r\ndirectly, instead of indirectly, answerable for the first Mrs. Eustace\'s\r\ndeath. I frankly make my confession, and leave you to tell Mr. Benjamin\r\nwhether you think my new Catechism worthy of examination or not."\r\n\r\nI thought his "new Catechism" (as he called it) decidedly worthy of\r\nexamination. If you don\'t ag ree with this view, and if you are dying\r\nto be done with me and my narrative, pass on to the next chapter by all\r\nmeans!\r\n\r\nBenjamin produced the Questions and Answers; and read them to me, at my\r\nrequest, in these terms:\r\n\r\n"Questions suggested by the letter discovered at Gleninch. First Group:\r\nQuestions relating to the Diary. First Question: obtaining access to Mr.\r\nMacallan\'s private journal, was Miserrimus Dexter guided by any previous\r\nknowledge of its contents?\r\n\r\n"Answer: It is doubtful if he had any such knowledge. The probabilities\r\nare that he noticed how carefully Mr. Macallan secured his Diary from\r\nobservation; that he inferred therefrom the existence of dangerous\r\ndomestic secrets in the locked-up pages; and that he speculated on using\r\nthose secrets for his own purpose when he caused the false keys to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n"Second Question: To what motive are we to attribute Miserrimus Dexter\'s\r\ninterference with the sheriff\'s officers, on the day when they seized\r\nMr. Macallan\'s Diary along with his other papers?\r\n\r\n"Answer: In replying to this question, we must first do justice to\r\nDexter himself. Infamously as we now know him to have acted, the man\r\nwas not a downright fiend. That he secretly hated Mr. Macallan, as his\r\nsuccessful rival in the affections of the woman he loved--and that he\r\ndid all he could to induce the unhappy lady to desert her husband--are,\r\nin this case, facts not to be denied. On the other hand, it is fairly to\r\nbe doubted whether he were additionally capable of permitting the friend\r\nwho trusted him to be tried for murder, through his fault, without\r\nmaking an effort to save the innocent man. It had naturally never\r\noccurred to Mr. Macallan (being guiltless of his wife\'s death) to\r\ndestroy his Diary and his letters, in the fear that they might be used\r\nagainst him. Until the prompt and secret action of the Fiscal took him\r\nby surprise, the idea of his being charged with the murder of his\r\nwife was an idea which we know, from his own statement, had never even\r\nentered his mind. But Dexter must have looked at the matter from another\r\npoint of view. In his last wandering words (spoken when his mind broke\r\ndown) he refers to the Diary in these terms, \'The Diary will hang him;\r\nI won\'t have him hanged.\' If he could have found his opportunity of\r\ngetting at it in time--or if the sheriff\'s officers had not been too\r\nquick for him--there can be no reasonable doubt that Dexter would\r\nhave himself destroyed the Diary, foreseeing the consequences of its\r\nproduction in court. So strongly does he appear to have felt these\r\nconsiderations, that he even resisted the officers in the execution of\r\ntheir duty. His agitation when he sent for Mr. Playmore to interfere\r\nwas witnessed by that gentleman, and (it may not be amiss to add) was\r\ngenuine agitation beyond dispute.\r\n\r\n"Questions of the Second Group: relating to the Wife\'s Confession. First\r\nQuestion: What prevented Dexter from destroying the letter, when he\r\nfirst discovered it under the dead woman\'s pillow?\r\n\r\n"Answer: The same motives which led him to resist the seizure of the\r\nDiary, and to give his evidence in the prisoner\'s favor at the Trial,\r\ninduced him to preserve the letter until the verdict was known. Looking\r\nback once more at his last words (as taken down by Mr. Benjamin), we may\r\ninfer that if the verdict had been Guilty, he would not have hesitated\r\nto save the innocent husband by producing the wife\'s confession. There\r\nare degrees in all wickedness. Dexter was wicked enough to suppress\r\nthe letter, which wounded his vanity by revealing him as an object for\r\nloathing and contempt--but he was not wicked enough deliberately to let\r\nan innocent man perish on the scaffold. He was capable of exposing the\r\nrival whom he hated to the infamy and torture of a public accusation of\r\nmurder; but, in the event of an adverse verdict, he shrank before the\r\ndirer cruelty of letting him be hanged. Reflect, in this connection, on\r\nwhat he must have suffered, villain as he was, when he first read the\r\nwife\'s confession. He had calculated on undermining her affection for\r\nher husband--and whither had his calculations led him? He had driven\r\nthe woman whom he loved to the last dreadful refuge of death by suicide!\r\nGive these considerations their due weight; and you will understand that\r\nsome little redeeming virtue might show itself, as the result even of\r\n_this_ man\'s remorse.\r\n\r\n"Second Question: What motive influenced Miserrimus Dexter\'s conduct,\r\nwhen Mrs. (Valeria) Macallan informed him that she proposed reopening\r\nthe inquiry into the poisoning at Gleninch?\r\n\r\n"Answer: In all probability, Dexter\'s guilty fears suggested to him that\r\nhe might have been watched on the morning when he secretly entered the\r\nchamber in which the first Mrs. Eustace lay dead. Feeling no scruples\r\nhimself to restrain him from listening at doors and looking through\r\nkeyholes, he would be all the more ready to suspect other people of the\r\nsame practices. With this dread in him, it would naturally occur to his\r\nmind that Mrs. Valeria might meet with the person who had watched him,\r\nand might hear all that the person had discovered--unless he led her\r\nastray at the outset of her investigations. Her own jealous suspicions\r\nof Mrs. Beauly offered him the chance of easily doing this. And he was\r\nall the readier to profit by the chance, being himself animated by the\r\nmost hostile feeling toward that lady. He knew her as the enemy who\r\ndestroyed the domestic peace of the mistress of the house; he loved\r\nthe mistress of the house--and he hated her enemy accordingly. The\r\npreservation of his guilty secret, and the persecution of Mrs. Beauly:\r\nthere you have the greater and the lesser motive of his conduct in his\r\nrelations with Mrs. Eustace the second!"*\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n* Note by the writer of the Narrative:\r\n\r\nLook back for a further illustration of this point of view to the\r\nscene at Benjamin\'s house (Chapter XXXV.), where Dexter, in a moment of\r\nungovernable agitation, betrays his own secret to Valeria.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nBenjamin laid down his notes, and took off his spectacles.\r\n\r\n"We have not thought it necessary to go further than this," he said. "Is\r\nthere any point you can think of that is still left unexplained?"\r\n\r\nI reflected. There was no point of any importance left unexplained that\r\nI could remember. But there was one little matter (suggested by the\r\nrecent allusions to Mrs. Beauly) which I wished (if possible) to have\r\nthoroughly cleared up.\r\n\r\n"Have you and Mr. Playmore ever spoken together on the subject of my\r\nhusband\'s former attachment to Mrs. Beauly?" I asked. "Has Mr. Playmore\r\never told you why Eustace did not marry her, after the Trial?"\r\n\r\n"I put that question to Mr. Playmore myself," said Benjamin. "He\r\nanswered it easily enough. Being your husband\'s confidential friend and\r\nadviser, he was consulted when Mr. Eustace wrote to Mrs. Beauly, after\r\nthe Trial; and he repeated the substance of the letter, at my request.\r\nWould you like to hear what I remember of it, in my turn?"\r\n\r\nI owned that I should like to hear it. What Benjamin thereupon told me,\r\nexactly coincided with what Miserrimus Dexter had told me--as related in\r\nthe thirtieth chapter of my narrative. Mrs. Beauly had been a witness\r\nof the public degradation of my husband. That was enough in itself to\r\nprevent him from marrying her: He broke off with _her_ for the same\r\nreason which had led him to separate himself from _me._ Existence with a\r\nwoman who knew that he had been tried for his life as a murderer was an\r\nexistence which he had not resolution enough to face. The two accounts\r\nagreed in every particular. At last my jealous curiosity was pacified;\r\nand Benjamin was free to dismiss the past from further consideration,\r\nand to approach the more critical and more interesting topic of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nHis first inquiries related to Eustace. He asked if my husband had any\r\nsuspicion of the proceedings which had taken place at Gleninch.\r\n\r\nI told him what had happened, and how I had contrived to put off the\r\ninevitable disclosure for a time.\r\n\r\nMy old friend\'s face cleared up as he listened to me.\r\n\r\n"This will be good news for Mr. Playmore," he said. "Our excellent\r\nfriend, the lawyer, is sorely afraid that our discoveries may\r\ncompromise your position with your husband. On the one hand, he is\r\nnaturally anxious to spare Mr. Eustace the distress which he must\r\ncertainly feel, if he read his first wife\'s confession. On the other\r\nhand, it is impossible, in justice (as Mr. Playmore puts it) to\r\nthe unborn children of your marriage, to suppress a document which\r\nvindicates the memory of their father from the aspersion that the Scotch\r\nVerdict might otherwise cast on it."\r\n\r\nI listened attentively. Benjamin had touched on a trouble which was\r\nstill secretly preying on my mind.\r\n\r\n"How does Mr. Playmore propose to meet the difficulty?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"He can only meet it in one way," Benjamin replied. "He proposes to\r\nseal up the original manuscript of the letter, and to add to it a plain\r\nstatement of the circumstances under which it was discovered, supported\r\nby your signed attestation and mine, as witnesses to the fact. This\r\ndone, he must leave it to you to take your husband into your confidence,\r\nat your own time. It will then be for Mr. Eustace to decide whether\r\nhe will open the inclosure--or whether he will leave it, with the seal\r\nunbroken, as an heirloom to his children, to be made public or not, at\r\ntheir discretion, when they are of an age to think for themselves. Do\r\nyou consent to this, my dear? Or would you prefer that Mr. Playmore\r\nshould see your husband, and act for you in the matter?"\r\n\r\nI decided, without hesitation, to take the responsibility on myself.\r\nWhere the question of guiding Eustace\'s decision was concerned, I\r\nconsidered my influence to be decidedly superior to the influence of Mr.\r\nPlaymore. My choice met with Benjamin\'s full approval. He arranged to\r\nwrite to Edinburgh, and relieve the lawyer\'s anxieties by that day\'s\r\npost.\r\n\r\nThe one last thing now left to be settled related to our plans for\r\nreturning to England. The doctors were the authorities on this subject.\r\nI promised to consult them about it at their next visit to Eustace.\r\n\r\n"Have you anything more to say to me?" Benjamin inquired, as he opened\r\nhis writing-case.\r\n\r\nI thought of Miserrimus Dexter and Ariel; and I inquired if he had heard\r\nany news of them lately. My old friend sighed, and warned me that I had\r\ntouched on a painful subject.\r\n\r\n"The best thing that can happen to that unhappy man is likely to\r\nhappen," he said. "The one change in him is a change that threatens\r\nparalysis. You may hear of his death before you get back to England."\r\n\r\n"And Ariel?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Quite unaltered," Benjamin answered. "Perfectly happy so long as she\r\nis with \'the Master.\' From all I can hear of her, poor soul, she doesn\'t\r\nreckon Dexter among moral beings. She laughs at the idea of his dying;\r\nand she waits patiently, in the firm persuasion that he will recognize\r\nher again."\r\n\r\nBenjamin\'s news saddened and silenced me. I left him to his letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE STORY.\r\n\r\nIn ten days more we returned to England, accompanied by Benjamin.\r\n\r\nMrs. Macallan\'s house in London offered us ample accommodation. We\r\ngladly availed ourselves of her proposal, when she invited us to stay\r\nwith her until our child was born, and our plans for the future were\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nThe sad news from the asylum (for which Benjamin had prepared my mind at\r\nParis) reached me soon after our return to England. Miserrimus Dexter\'s\r\nrelease from the burden of life had come to him by slow degrees. A few\r\nhours before he breathed his last he rallied for a while, and recognized\r\nAriel at his bedside. He feebly pronounced her name, and looked at her,\r\nand asked for me. They thought of sending for me, but it was too late.\r\nBefore the messenger could be dispatched, he said, with a touch of his\r\nold self-importance, "Silence, all of you! my brains are weary; I am\r\ngoing to sleep." He closed his eyes in slumber, and never awoke again.\r\nSo for this man too the end came mercifully, without grief or pain! So\r\nthat strange and many-sided life--with its guilt and its misery, its\r\nfitful flashes of poetry and humor, its fantastic gayety, cruelty, and\r\nvanity--ran its destined course, and faded out like a dream!\r\n\r\nAlas for Ariel! She had lived for the Master--what more could she do,\r\nnow the Master was gone? She could die for him.\r\n\r\nThey had mercifully allowed her to attend the funeral of Miserrimus\r\nDexter--in the hope that the ceremony might avail to convince her of his\r\ndeath. The anticipation was not realized; she still persisted in denying\r\nthat "the Master" had left her. They were obliged to restrain the poor\r\ncreature by force when the coffin was lowered into the grave; and they\r\ncould only remove her from the cemetery by the same means when the\r\nburial-service was over. From that time her life alternated, for a\r\nfew weeks, between fits of raving delirium and intervals of lethargic\r\nrepose. At the annual ball given in the asylum, when the strict\r\nsuperintendence of the patients was in some degree relaxed, the alarm\r\nwas raised, a little before midnight, that Ariel was missing. The nurse\r\nin charge had left her asleep, and had yielded to the temptation of\r\ngoing downstairs to look at the dancing. When the woman returned to\r\nher post, Ariel was gone. The presence of strangers, and the confusion\r\nincidental to the festival, offered her facilities for escaping which\r\nwould not have presented themselves at any other time. That night the\r\nsearch for her proved to be useless. The next morning brought with it\r\nthe last touching and terrible tidings of her. She had strayed back to\r\nthe burial-ground; and she had been found toward sunrise, dead of cold\r\nand exposure, on Miserrimus Dexter\'s grave. Faithful to the last, Ariel\r\nhad followed the Master! Faithful to the last, Ariel had died on the\r\nMaster\'s grave!\r\n\r\nHaving written these sad words, I turn willingly to a less painful\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nEvents had separated me from Major Fitz-David, after the date of\r\nthe dinner-party which had witnessed my memorable meeting with Lady\r\nClarinda. From that time I heard little or nothing of the Major; and\r\nI am ashamed to say I had almost entirely forgotten him--when I\r\nwas reminded of the modern Don Juan by the amazing appearance of\r\nwedding-cards, addressed to me at my mother-in-law\'s house! The Major\r\nhad settled in life at last. And, more wonderful still, the Major had\r\nchosen as the lawful ruler of his household and himself--"the future\r\nQueen of Song," the round-eyed, overdressed young lady with the strident\r\nsoprano voice!\r\n\r\nWe paid our visit of congratulation in due form; and we really did feel\r\nfor Major Fitz-David.\r\n\r\nThe ordeal of marriage had so changed my gay and gallant admirer\r\nof former times that I hardly knew him again. He had lost all his\r\npretensions to youth: he had become, hopelessly and undisguisedly, an\r\nold man. Standing behind the chair on which his imperious young wife sat\r\nenthroned, he looked at her submissively between every two words that he\r\naddressed to me, as if he waited for her permission to open his lips\r\nand speak. Whenever she interrupted him--and she did it, over and\r\nover again, without ceremony--he submitted with a senile docility and\r\nadmiration, at once absurd and shocking to see.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she beautiful?" he said to me (in his wife\'s hearing!). "What a\r\nfigure, and what a voice! You remember her voice? It\'s a loss, my dear\r\nlady, an irretrievable loss, to the operatic stage! Do you know, when I\r\nthink what that grand creature might have done, I sometimes ask myself\r\nif I really had any right to marry her. I feel, upon my honor I feel, as\r\nif I had committed a fraud on the public!"\r\n\r\nAs for the favored object of this quaint mixture of admiration and\r\nregret, she was pleased to receive me graciously, as an old friend.\r\nWhile Eustace was talking to the Major, the bride drew me aside out of\r\ntheir hearing, and explained her motives for marrying, with a candor\r\nwhich was positively shameless.\r\n\r\n"You see we are a large family at home, quite unprovided for!" this\r\nodious young woman whispered in my ear. "It\'s all very well about my\r\nbeing a \'Queen of Song\' and the rest of it. Lord bless you, I have been\r\noften enough to the opera, and I have learned enough of my music-master,\r\nto know what it takes to make a fine singer. I haven\'t the patience\r\nto work at it as those foreign women do: a parcel of brazen-faced\r\nJezebels--I hat e them! No! no! between you and me, it was a great\r\ndeal easier to get the money by marrying the old gentleman. Here I am,\r\nprovided for--and there\'s all my family provided for, too--and nothing\r\nto do but to spend the money. I am fond of my family; I\'m a good\r\ndaughter and sister--_I_ am! See how I\'m dressed; look at the furniture:\r\nI haven\'t played my cards badly, have I? It\'s a great advantage to marry\r\nan old man--you can twist him round your little finger. Happy? Oh, yes!\r\nI\'m quite happy; and I hope you are, too. Where are you living now? I\r\nshall call soon, and have a long gossip with you. I always had a sort of\r\nliking for you, and (now I\'m as good as you are) I want to be friends."\r\n\r\nI made a short and civil reply to this; determining inwardly that when\r\nshe did visit me she should get no further than the house-door. I don\'t\r\nscruple to say that I was thoroughly disgusted with her. When a woman\r\nsells herself to a man, that vile bargain is none the less infamous (to\r\nmy mind) because it happens to be made under the sanction of the Church\r\nand the Law.\r\n\r\nAs I sit at the desk thinking, the picture of the Major and his wife\r\nvanishes from my memory--and the last scene in my story comes slowly\r\ninto view.\r\n\r\nThe place is my bedroom. The persons (both, if you will be pleased to\r\nexcuse them, in bed) are myself and my son. He is already three weeks\r\nold; and he is now lying fast asleep by his mother\'s side. My good Uncle\r\nStarkweather is coming to London to baptize him. Mrs. Macallan will be\r\nhis godmother; and his godfathers will be Benjamin and Mr. Playmore.\r\nI wonder whether my christening will pass off more merrily than my\r\nwedding?\r\n\r\nThe doctor has just left the house, in some little perplexity about me.\r\nHe has found me reclining as usual (latterly) in my arm-chair; but on\r\nthis particular day he has detected symptoms of exhaustion, which he\r\nfinds quite unaccountable under the circumstances, and which warn him to\r\nexert his authority by sending me back to my bed.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that I have not taken the doctor into my confidence. There\r\nare two causes for those signs of exhaustion which have surprised my\r\nmedical attendant--and the names of them are--Anxiety and Suspense.\r\n\r\nOn this day I have at last summoned courage enough to perform the\r\npromise which I made to my husband in Paris. He is informed, by this\r\ntime, how his wife\'s Confession was discovered. He knows (on Mr.\r\nPlaymore\'s authority) that the letter may be made the means, if he so\r\nwill it, of publicly vindicating his innocence in a Court of Law. And,\r\nlast and most important of all, he is now aware that the Confession\r\nitself has been kept a sealed secret from him, out of compassionate\r\nregard for his own peace of mind, as well as for the memory of the\r\nunhappy woman who was once his wife.\r\n\r\nThese necessary disclosures I have communicated to my husband--not\r\nby word of mouth; when the time came, I shrank from speaking to\r\nhim personally of his first wife--but by a written statement of the\r\ncircumstances, taken mainly out of my letters received in Paris from\r\nBenjamin and Mr. Playmore. He has now had ample time to read all that I\r\nhave written to him, and to reflect on it in the retirement of his\r\nown study. I am waiting, with the fatal letter in my hand--and my\r\nmother-in-law is waiting in the next room to me--to hear from his own\r\nlips whether he decides to break the seal or not.\r\n\r\nThe minutes pass; and still we fail to hear his footstep on the stairs.\r\nMy doubts as to which way his decision may turn affect me more and more\r\nuneasily the longer I wait. The very possession of the letter, in the\r\npresent excited state of my nerves, oppresses and revolts me. I shrink\r\nfrom touching it or looking at it. I move it about restlessly from place\r\nto place on the bed, and still I cannot keep it out of my mind. At last,\r\nan odd fancy strikes me. I lift up one of the baby\'s hands, and put the\r\nletter under it--and so associate that dreadful record of sin and misery\r\nwith something innocent and pretty that seems to hallow and to purify\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe minutes pass; the half-hour longer strikes from the clock on the\r\nchimney-piece; and at last I hear him! He knocks softly, and opens the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nHe is deadly pale: I fancy I can detect traces of tears on his cheeks.\r\nBut no outward signs of agitation escape him as he takes his seat by my\r\nside. I can see that he has waited until he could control himself--for\r\nmy sake.\r\n\r\nHe takes my hand, and kisses me tenderly.\r\n\r\n"Valeria!" he says; "let me once more ask you to forgive what I said\r\nand did in the bygone time. If I understand nothing else, my love, I\r\nunderstand this: The proof of my innocence has been found; and I owe it\r\nentirely to the courage and the devotion of my wife!"\r\n\r\nI wait a little, to enjoy the full luxury of hearing him say those\r\nwords--to revel in the love and the gratitude that moisten his dear eyes\r\nas they look at me. Then I rouse my resolution, and put the momentous\r\nquestion on which our future depends.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to see the letter, Eustace?"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering directly, he questions me in his turn.\r\n\r\n"Have you got the letter here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Sealed up?"\r\n\r\n"Sealed up."\r\n\r\nHe waits a little, considering what he is going to say next before he\r\nsays it,\r\n\r\n"Let me be sure that I know exactly what it is I have to decide," he\r\nproceeds. "Suppose I insist on reading the letter--?"\r\n\r\nThere I interrupt him. I know it is my duty to restrain myself. But I\r\ncannot do my duty.\r\n\r\n"My darling, don\'t talk of reading the letter! Pray, pray spare\r\nyourself--"\r\n\r\nHe holds up his hand for silence.\r\n\r\n"I am not thinking of myself," he says. "I am thinking of my dead\r\nwife. If I give up the public vindication of my innocence, in my own\r\nlifetime--if I leave the seal of the letter unbroken--do you say, as Mr.\r\nPlaymore says, that I shall be acting mercifully and tenderly toward the\r\nmemory of my wife?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Eustace, there cannot be the shadow of a doubt of it!"\r\n\r\n"Shall I be making some little atonement for any pain that I may have\r\nthoughtlessly caused her to suffer in her lifetime?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! yes!"\r\n\r\n"And, Valeria--shall I please You?"\r\n\r\n"My darling, you will enchant me!"\r\n\r\n"Where is the letter?"\r\n\r\n"In your son\'s hand, Eustace."\r\n\r\nHe goes around to the other side of the bed, and lifts the baby\'s\r\nlittle pink hand to his lips. For a while he waits so, in sad and secret\r\ncommunion with himself. I see his mother softly open the door, and watch\r\nhim as I am watching him. In a moment more our suspense is at an end.\r\nWith a heavy sigh, he lays the child\'s hand back again on the sealed\r\nletter; and by that one little action says (as if in words) to his\r\nson--"I leave it to You!"\r\n\r\nAnd so it ended! Not as I thought it would end; not perhaps as you\r\nthought it would end. What do we know of our own lives? What do we know\r\nof the fulfillment of our dearest wishes? God knows--and that is best.\r\n\r\nMust I shut up the paper? Yes. There is nothing more for you to read or\r\nfor me to say.\r\n\r\nExcept this--as a postscript. Don\'t bear hardly, good people, on the\r\nfollies and the errors of my husband\'s life. Abuse _me_ as much as you\r\nplease. But pray think kindly of Eustace for my sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Law and the Lady, by Wilkie Collins\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LAW AND THE LADY ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1622-8.txt or 1622-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/2/1622/\r\n\r\nProduced by John Hamm, and James Rusk\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
